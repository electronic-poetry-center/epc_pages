Harry,
I love your insight!

And I detest the smugness of those who dispatch an honest question with =
a quip..."This isn't even funny." or "I agree completely." =20

The honesty of the question begs for an honest answer, not some pompous =
ass dismissal.=20

"By 1900, Hitler's talents as an artist surfaced. He did well enough in
school to be eligible for either the university preparatory "gymnasium" or
the technical/scientific Realschule. Because the latter had a course in
drawing, Adolf accepted his father's decision to enroll him in the
Realschule. He did not do well there."
http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.hitler.html

Not an art school. A technical/scientific "Realschule" with a drawing class.

Here is some of Hitler's art:

http://www.fpp.co.uk/Hitler/artist/Cullis/Wien_1912_17x22.jpg

"Freedom from all convention"? I don't think so. If Nazism is your idea of
free thinking, you're not well. But I doubt that's what you're trying to
say.

> the design elements of the
> Third Reich propaganda machine  're with Russian

I don't understand what you're trying to say here. You're saying the
"greatest mass public art" of the 20th c. was where?

> if you think pos who form cliques..clamor for  power
> $$$ attention reading and pub..are any different than those who

> attention...

I thought, mistakenly, that there would be very little difference between
Gore and Bush. I didn't know enough about Bush. Leading the USA to war
justified with lies, undermining the separation of church and state, and
ruling by creating a climate of fear is probably not what Gore would have
done.

> you must have been reading some other list all these
> yrs....we 're  'll  the dark brother..drn..

Certainly we're all in the dark.

But the original point that was made in this thread was that there is some
connection between the experimentalism of Dada and the Nazis experimenting
on Jews. I don't see any connection there.

I'm pleased to find out, through the ineffable Doktor Nudel, that "one
can't pick and choose" between? what? "bierhall putsch/cabaret
voltaire."  Ah, it's all the same logic, is it?  I'm sure Max Ernst,
Raoul Hausmann, Kurt Schwitters, Hans Richter, George Grosz, the
Heartfields, et al., fugitives from Nazism as they were, would have
had something eloquent to say to anyone who blithely said that they
were on the same level as their persecutors.  And Nazism as
the "freedom from all convention"?  I'm equally sure those wacky
rebels at Krupp's and IG Farben, in between designing photomontages
and scripting sound poems, would have applauded that apercu
vociferously.

If Tzara was right in saying that "thought is made in the mouth," then
it's reasonable to speculate where the good Doktor's -- well, let's
call them observations -- are made.  Perhaps a little further south?

Artist Profile

Polish-born, New York City-based artist Monika Weiss creates
environments that relate to the body and to the tension that
characterizes specific relationship between biology and culture. In her
drawings and multi-media installations, combined with performance and
sound, Weiss explores physical properties of the act of drawing, which
she combines with references to the ancient and medieval symbols and
concepts of the world and the human being. Weiss uses her own body
directly in her art as both the maker and the inhabitant of the
artistic object.

In 2005 the artist was awarded a Philip Guston and Musa McKim
Residency, YADDO, Saratoga Springs, New York. Her survey Monika Weiss:
Five Rivers was organized at Lehman College Art Gallery, and Monika
Weiss: Between Presence and Performative Memory was shown at the
Instytut Sztuki WYSPA in Gdansk. Her installation Phlegethon-Milczenie
will be presented this year at the Kunsthaus Dresden and at ArteBA,
Buenos Aires.  Weiss studied piano and musical composition in the
Warsaw Conservatory for many years and continues to compose music for
her work.

Mike- Could you briefly expand on the comment that Greil Marcus's Lipstick
Traces discusses this because I am considering getting a copy. I probably
will anyway, but I am curious what the book says. Peace,

Dada and Fascism do not equate. I refer you to Dr.
Lawrence Britt's 14 defining characteristics of
Fascism, looking at the regimes of Hitler (Germany),
Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia)
and a hodge podge of Fascist Latin American regimes:

1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying
Cause
4. Supremacy of the Military
5. Rampant Sexism
6. Controlled Mass Media
7. Obsession with National Security
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined
9. Corporate Power is Protected
10. Labor Power is Suppressed
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption
14. Fraudulent Elections

http://www.omnicenter.org/warpeacecollection/facism.htm#14fascism

Compare these to the irrational (transrational)
characteristics of dada, and you'll see some marked
and ultimately irreconcilable differences, though,
perhaps, there are a few (cronyism is certainly found
in Surrealism, as is sexism, but not, I'd argue, in
dada). Anyway, Fascism can never be against itself:

DADA is a virgin microbe
DADA is against the high cost of living
DADA
limited complany for the exploitation of ideas
DADA has 391 different attitudes and colours according
to the sex of the
president
It changes - affirms - says the opposite at the same
time - no importance -
shouts - goes fishing.
Dada is the chameleon of rapid and self-interested
change.
Dada is against the future. Dada is dead. Dada is
absurd. Long live Dada.
Dada is not a literary school, howl

Best,
Joseph

Thank goodness none of Britt's Fascist characteristics are either operative
or attributable to current conditions in the United States!
Just finished reading Jane Mayer's recent "Memo" piece in the New Yorker -
and found it a delight to see the multifold ways in which Bush's Executive
Branch has been restrained by Congress and the Courts from throwing out the
Constitution and indulging in practices of cruelty and torture in Iraq,
Quantanamo and elsewhere.

Whew. Thank God that the Executive's reading and education in 'free verse'
in poetry did not influence Cheney, Gonzales and Rumsfeld, et al, to rewrite
the Constitution and give the Executive (aka the Vice President's Office in
Coordination with the Pentagon) the liberty to go it on their own.

I do hear these guys do love to read Poe's Pit & The Pendulum over and over
again.

Spooky times and where's/how's the outrage!!

Hello all,

On behalf of the whole dcpoetry web crew, I am very pleased to announce
a complete overhaul and updating of our website

http://www.dcpoetry.com

All the material from the old site -- poetry anthologies, history
project, reading series and venue information -- has been carried over
and given a new look. The anthologies can now be viewed in a variety of
ways: by author, year, and venue. (An incomplete list of authors whose
work has been featured in the anthologies from 1999 to the present can
be found at the end of this email. We encourage authors to view their
work and let us know of any formatting problems that may have arisen out of
the conversion process.)

We've also added a ton of new text and audio content, including...

* Dog City (1977) - PDF full text
* Dog City 2 (1980) - PDF full text
* Roof 4 (Fall 1977), "Washington DC Forum" - PDF full text
* Anselm Berrigan and Tom Orange at Bridge Street 12-12-04 - MP3s

New audio drawn from the vast archives of Doug Lang, Buck Downs and
others will be featured on a regular basis.

Also on the horizon...
* resource pages for current DC-based or affiliated publications
* the complete run of Primary Writing (1995-) edited by Phyllis
Rosenzweig and Diane Ward (PDFs)

I want to thank our web crew for making this renovation happen: Ryan
Walker (webmaster), Mel Nichols (co-editor) and Adam Good (sound man).

Harry,

I had thought Nietzche and Wagner were the heroes of Nazism, The Ride of the W., Superman. Dadaism did involve an attack on bourgeois values, but does dada believe in a nationalist racism? I do not think so.

Come to think of it, Hitler's love of his dog -then you have Checkers... I think you are right. Nazis understood the power of images -leavened with hate and fear- in a modern way.

Manipulation of sentiment through language: "cut and run," "blame game..." and the mother of all "weapons of mass deception." Didn't the Dadaist try to undercut this connection between sentiment (existing around cultural constructs) and mass manipulation, or, a more sexy word for it, "leadership"?

 "And some people within Italian Futurism (which is different from Russian
Futurism) were quite enamored of the machine and had high hopes concerning
technological progress and the place of art and artists in a new society."

It is true that Futurism and Italian Fascism were very connected FT
Marinetti was part of Mussolini's inner circle at the beginning. I don't
think however that is fair or intellectually honest to give a pass to all
the artists and movements who were Marxists. The fact is that Stalinism,
Maoism and Leninism killed many more people than Fascism or Nazism which are
equally evil.

I would argue for a Humanist approach to this but I would keep my
intellectuals out of politics and let the potholes be filled by pragmatists.

Subject: Re: An idea about Dadaism

Mussolini had some sort of affiliation with Italian Futurism. And some
people within Italian Futurism (which is different from Russian Futurism)
were quite enamored of the machine and had high hopes concerning
technological progress and the place of art and artists in a new society.
Which turned out eventually to be Mussolini's Italy, perhaps eventually to
their dismay. But I have never read of Dada being so overtly related to
fascism. Then again, I'm not a scholar on the matter.

Regardless of whether poet innovators and their inventions are initially
allied with the forces of darkness, their insights will be exploited. I'm
under the impression that the typographic innovations of both Dada and
Futurism were (relatively) quickly exploited in newspapers and magazines,
for instance. Perhaps the same can be said, as you seem to imply, concerning
their approach to sound poetry and politicians' approaches to public
performance.

But no connection between innovators/inventions and those who use the
inventions is required for invention to be exploited. All that is required
to exploit an insight in an understanding of its relevance to one's purpose.

And that the Nazis experimented on people and the artists experimented with
language etc is among the most tenuous of connections, it seems to me.

And as for concrete causing a retreat of the spoken word, boring it back
onto the page, that seems unlikely to me. The relations, for instance,
between visual poetry and sound poetry are obvious, and the vectors of
experimental work such as concrete point outward from the page into other
media and arts; not retreat, but advance through all the dimensions of
language.

I'm not sure what you are saying in much of the exchange, Harry, as I've
pointed out previously--apologies--but I take your point that Nazism was not
corrupt in every facet of life.

Also, I agree that it is possible for fascist regimes to cater to art and
artists. Though usually the 'support' comes with a requirement to affirm the
regime or its form of nationalism or at least not to criticize the regime.

Pound and some of the Italian Futurists were enamoured of Italian fascism,
perhaps because of its intent to honour the artistic and intellectual
achievements of the past and its intent to foster intellectual and artistic
culture of the present and future. One of the catches would be fostering
non-dissenting intellectual and artistic culture.

And Haas's post reminds me that some forms of Marxism are also imbued with a
high place for art and artists--as long as the art and artists do not
question the moral worth of the regime.

As for the place of Dada in all this, I'm not a scholar on the matter, but
would not expect it to emerge as simply a true and shining light in a dark
time.

Still, relation between Dada's experimentalism and the Nazi's experimenting
on people seems implausible, don't you think?

This is mainly an art journal, but we are interested in the

Subject: Auckland Art Gallery's new journal - a call for papers




This year the Auckland Art Gallery's E.H. McCormick Research Library
will be publishing the first issue of Reading Room, an annual refereed
journal of art and culture. The journal has been established through the
generosity of Dr John Mayo of Queensland in memory of his late wife
Marylyn Mayo. Edited by Tina Barton, Wystan Curnow and Robert Leonard,
the issue's main theme will be "autobiography in the wake of
conceptualism".

In the 1960s and 1970s the idea of art as a mode of self-expression was
categorically disavowed. Before conceptual art, autobiography in art was
largely to do with expressing the artist's inner life, but conceptual
artists were more concerned with measuring life's outward
manifestations. On Kawara is an obvious example. Every day he recorded
the time he got up, where he went, who he met, and noted that he was
still alive, but left psychology out of the picture. Where the old
romantic idea of an expressive-confessional art persisted, its
production and reception were often inflected by psychoanalytic theory,
as in the work of Louise Bourgeois. Lacan's idea that the unconscious
was structured like a language became hugely influential. These
developments brought new opportunities and problems for autobiography.

The editors are looking for approaches to this topic that provide fresh
insights into the ways in which the artistic subject and their work are
intertwined, especially those which examine the topic in terms of its
implications for art history. In addition to dealing with work produced
with and after conceptualism, it is hoped that writers will address
earlier art in the light of insights provided by conceptualism.

Abstracts and proposals relating to this topic are sought by 20 March
2006, and final manuscripts of around 5000 words by 30 June 2006.=20

Uh, acceptance of Marxism doesn't necessarily mean support  of "Stalinism,
Maoism and Leninism", chief. Sure, commies've done some nasty  bullshit over the
years, but Marxism itself is moot or openly opposed to  genocide, nuclear
proliferation, purges, wars of  aggression, death camps, gulags, etc..

On the other hand, conflict, reckless machismo, and aggressive  nationalism
are all keystones of the Fascist agenda. Whereas a "Marxist artist"  can fully
and completely eschew the more brutal trappings of Stalin et al., the
Futurists knowingly consented to a program built upon militancy and chauvanism.
Which makes sense, seeing as how they wanted to abolish "morality and feminism"
and spread "ruinous and incendiary violence."

In other words, Marxism gets its bad name from its various perversions ;
Fascism gets its bad name from its inherent brutality and inhumanity.

Sibyl Moholy-nagy, in her biography of her husband, Moholy-Nagy,
Experiment in Totality, gives a great account of a  March 1934 German
Press Association banquet in Berlin for Marinetti attended by Goebels,
Goring, Hess and Rohm among other big Nazis and Sybyl, Moholy, and
Schwitters, who had gone along only because they did not wish to offend
Marinetti by spurning his invitation. The occasion was an exhibtion of
Italian Futurist Art put together by Marinetti for Mussolini at the
behest of the German authorities. Angered that the big Nazis were just
treating it as an occasion for a good feed, got to his feet and after a
few very sarcastic remarks lauching into a furious performance of  'The
Raid on Adrianople.' which involved smashing  wine glasses, climbing on

drunken Schwitters, who'd had just about as much as he could take from
the members of Hitler's cultural police with whom he had been seated,
climbed to his feet  to give a thundering performance of his Dada
classic  'Anna Blume' . The banquet evidently never recovered  from this
poetic assault.=20

Merwin. Robert Creeley said of the book, "Famous last words for this
terrific book are hard to come by, but one such would be
'Wonderful!'... Famous Americans is my kind of people." Mr. Goodman's
poetry and criticism have appeared in Poetry and Art Forum. He lives
in Texas and Kobe, Japan, where he is a PhD candidate in sociology, a
translator of English and Japanese literature, and according to his
publicist, "active in the martial arts."

Here is some fine work by Canada's David Clark:

A IS FOR APPLE
http://aisforapple.net
"A is for Apple is an interactive work that investigates a cryptography of
the apple. Using an ever expanding series of associative links, the work
looks for hidden meanings, coincidences and insights that stem from the
apple. This leads to a vast web of references from western metaphysics,
popular culture, the history of cryptography, ideas of language, and
psychoanalytic theory."

MEANWHILE
http://meanwhile.ca
"Godard once said that a film must have a beginning, middle and an end but
not necessarily in that order. MEANWHILE explores new ways to detour from
the well-trodden path of narrative by giving the viewer a choice at the end
of each scene as to which direction in time they want to move in the story.
The nine scenes in this screwball comedy can be seen in any order; each path
revealing the intricate interconnectivity of the characters follies,
obsessions, and ambitions."

Dear Friends:

As many of you know last year William Allegrezza and I launched a new small
press here in Chicago called Cracked Slab Books.  After much deliberation we
have awarded the first Cracked Slab Heartland Poetry Prize to the book
Edging by Michelle Noteboom. Bill and I are very excited about Michelle's
book which Cole Swensen called "a rigorous, relentless, and compassionate
look at the body in its most vulnerable moments". So I would like to invite
all of you to come by our table during AWP and to buy a preview copy of
Michelle's book. Michelle's book will go to press run in April and will be
distributed by SPD. I look forward to seeing all of you in Austin.

Regards

Now, from Bachelard's chapter, "the dialectics of outside and inside", iv.
and v.

"Then, on the surface of being, in that region where being wants to be both
visible and hidden, the movements of opening and closing are so numerous, so
frequently inverted, and so charged with hesitation, that we could conclude on
 the following formula: a man if half-open being."

v.
But how many daydreams we should have to analyze under the simple heading  of
Doors! For the door is an entire cosmos of the Half-open. In fact, it is one
of its primal images, the very origin of a daydream that accumulates desires
and  temptations: the temptation to open up the ultimate depths of being, and
the  desire to conquer all reticent beings. The door schematizes two strong
possibilities, which sharply classify two types of daydream. At times, it is
closed, bolted, padlocked. At others, it is open, that is to say, wide  open.

But then come the hours of greater imagining sensibility. On May nights  when
so many doors are closed, there is one that is just barely ajar. We have
only to give it a very slight push! The hinges have been well oiled And our fate
becomes visible.

[Then a paragraph here about the concept of the myth of the sacred  threshold
god.]

And what of all the doors of mere curiosity, that have tempted being for
nothing, for emptiness, for an unknown that is not even imagined?

Is there one of us who hasn't in his memories a Bluebeard chamber that
should not have been opened, even half-way? Or - which is the same thing for a
philosophy that believes in the primacy of the imagination - that should not
even have been imaged open, or capable of opening half-way?

How concrete everything becomes in the world of the spirit when an object,  a
mere door, can give images of hesitation, temptation, desire, security,
welcome and respect. If one were to give an account of all the doors one has
closed and opened, of all the doors one would like to re-open, one would have to
tell the story of one's entire life.

But is he who opens a door and he who closes it the same being? The  gestures
that make us conscious of security or freedom are rooted in a profound  depth
of being . . .

And then, onto what, toward what, do doors open? Do they open for the world
of men, or for the world of solitude? Ramon Gomez de la Serna wrote: "Doors
that  open on the countryside seem to confer freedom behind the world's back."

"From a purely ethical standpoint all art is  evil for this reason. Committed
writers, thinkers, artists and musicians  engage in morally criminal activity
because they could have spent their time  and effort relieving physical want
and distress; instead they indulge their  sensibilities, ostensibly for the
'spiritual' health of their culture,  which seldom understands or appreciates

what they do, further  compounding the waste.

Why do we forgive them? (To the extent we  do.)"

Sounds somewhat Buddhist.  Maybe not enough, though.  The bit about different people opening and closing the same door sounds like anatta, the principle of no permanent self to become attached to, to me.  I've never read this philosopher although I have heard of him.  Could anyone suggest a good book for a Bachelard-beginner?

The struggle against racism—from Katrina to San Francisco
By Judy Greenspan
San Francisco
Published Feb 26, 2006 7:04 PM

The Feb. 18 Black History Month Forum here, sponsored by the
International Action Center, featured a dynamic line-up of anti-racist,
anti-war and pro-labor activists. The evening was a loud protest against
the killings, evictions and displacement of the Black residents of New
Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. And the event was a celebration of
revolutionary optimism unfolding all over the world, from Venezuela to
Palestine.
Speakers at San Francisco forum:<br>Larry Holmes, Clarence Thomas
and<br>Mesha Monge-Irizarry.

Larry Holmes, national IAC co-chair, called upon everyone to unite for
justice for the Katrina evacuees. Holmes stated that reparations and the
right to return are essential demands for the movement. “What’s
happening in New Orleans is gentrification, pure and simple,” he said.
He noted the bitter irony of the U.S. government evicting poor African
American people during Black History Month.

Clarence Thomas, national co-chair of the Million Worker March Movement,
talked about the involvement of rank-and-file labor leaders in the
Millions More Movement. “We need to begin to forge new alliances and new
coalitions,” he said. Thomas, a member of International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, Local 10, challenged the left in this country to be
more active in these coalitions.

Mesha Monge-Irizarry, the mother of Idriss Stelley—a young Black man who
was shot and killed by San Francisco police four-and-a-half years
ago—also spoke. Monge-Irizarry, who is active in many social justice
campaigns in Bayview-Hunters Point, invited everyone to attend the
following week’s human rights and civil rights festival, “Bang4Change.”

“We are organizing this festival to reach out to youth. The young are
the people most at risk,” she said.

Students at this troubled northern Ontario reserve will be out of the
classroom for about a week after a fire broke out in the local secondary
school's shop room early Wednesday....“It's frustrating,” she said. “I
don't know how to describe it. The children will have to be away from
school, and it's not the first time.” In December, the school was closed
down when toxic mould was found in a newly constructed wing. -- "Fire

Only two months earlier, the province ordered a mass evacuation of the
reserve, which is on the shore of James Bay, after long-standing
contaminated water problems became a national scandal. Tragedy struck
again on Sunday afternoon when a blaze started in the building that
housed the jail and killed two young men who were locked in their cells.

and

It’d been more than two weeks since the bacteria were found in the
town’s water supply, and two years since a standing “boil water”
advisory was issued. The province commenced an evacuation by air two
days later. Comparisons to other recent water-related disasters have
been surprisingly absent. Canucks were happy to gloat over the American
racial chasm clearly reflected in the New Orleans floodwaters; facing
similar Canadian realities is proving a bit more awkward. -- "Bigger

On July 11th 1990 the Quebec Police were sent in to take down the Mohawk
barricade by opening fire on the people. It was an unsuccessful attack.
One policeman was killed, apparently by “friendly fire”. The siege
lasted 78 days. In the final tally hundreds of paramilitary Quebec
provincial police, 4,000 heavily armed military troops and the RCMP had
been deployed against the Mohawks at Kanehsata:ke and their two sister

This is a wonderful description - "Tantrum as Art"  when/as required!

In 1990 I  had the pleasure of publishing Marinetti's  Futurist Cookbook (La
Cucina Futurista) - which contains possibly an edible recipe or two, plus
many fantastic installation sites for dinners (planes roaring overhead to
nourish digestion while eating from aereoplane shaped food compositions of
meats, etc.).  It would have been totally appropriate, and not surprising
for that particular dinner of Germans.

Here is a brief dish:
Immortal Trout:
(formula by the Futurist Aeropainter Fillia)

Stuff some trout with chopped nuts and fry them in oil. Then wrap the trout
in very thin slices of calves liver.

Clearly a man who like to yoke together opposites.


Republished on the wave of new installation art and punk performance, the
book was something of a success. Though I must say I was a little astonished
when I got a call from a hip woman at the Book Club who managed to reprint
an edition as an optional 'cook book' choice for its members!

Marinetti - a mono maniac with a great imagination and bad politics. Right
after Katrina - which I suspect he would have loved for its Futurist sense
demolish power and force - I suspect Marinetti would have enjoyed serving
one of his inedible, yet fantastically framed banquets to Homeland Security
and FEMA officials while floating around atop a raft through the streets of
the old and much damaged quarters of New Orleans. For the visuals alone.

Right, but THE POETICS OF FIRE will consume you. (Sorry) It's a bit less quantumy than --SPACE. But I liked the dimensionality in --SPACE. --FIRE is thinner but if you like fire you can't go wrong. Definitely more movement. It's like free verse is to form. You can't go wrong with either of the two.

The School of the Art Institute of Chicago
Performance Art Department Symposium:

Re-Do It? Re-Presenting Bodies in Performance
March 16 & 17, 2006

Peggy Phelan has written, "Performance's only life is
in the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded,
documented, or otherwise participate in the
circulation of representations of representations:
once it does so, it becomes something other than
performance."  (Unmarked. The Politics of Performance,
p. 146)

On the other hand, Miwon Kwon writes, "·(E)ven if the
efficacy of  site-specific art from the past seems to
weaken when it is re-presented, the procedural
complications, ethical dilemmas, and pragmatic
headaches that such situations raise for artists,
collectors, dealers, and host institutions are still
meaningful. They represent an unprecedented strain on
established patterns of (re)producing, exhibiting,
borrowing/lending, purchasing/selling, and
commissioning/executing art works in general." (One
Place After Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational
Identity, p. 43)

Re-Do It? examines and discusses these and other
perplexing questions raised by re-presenting
experiential, "live" art, and the many
un-categorized practices that are commonly gathered
under the sign of "Performance Art."  The Symposium
begins on Thursday, March 16 with a public keynote
address, "Performance Returns," by Peggy Phelan.  It
continues on Friday, March 17 with a day of panels and
discussions; and ends with a performative extravaganza
of re-doable, un-redoable, and un-doable propositions
and acts by participating student, faculty and guest
artists.

      Erica Carpenter was born in 1970, in Wickford, RI (a fishing=20
village at the time, now turned boutique village). She got her BA at=20
Vasser (1993), her MFA at Brown (1998). In between she traveled in the=20=

2.Gerhard Roth
THE WILL TO SICKNESS
translated from the German by Tristram Wolff
"Dichten =3D," No.9
Short prose, 120pp., offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 1-886224-78-1 $14
Publication Date: March 15, 2006

Gerhard Roth burst on the German-speaking scene in the early 1970s with=20=

three fiercely experimental novels, among them our present DER WILLE=20
ZUR KRANKHEIT (1973). It is here that Roth developed his =93objective=94=20=

prose, his aggregates of minute observations and impressions. The=20
subjective narrator perceives, notes, thinks. Representation eludes his=20=

perspective. The effect is surreal with an undertone of Angst: =93i am=20=

preparing a slow disintegration of the external world inside my head.=94
	Roth was part of the literary group known as =93Forum Stadtpark=94=
 (later=20
renamed Graz Writers=92 Collective) where Peter Handke and Elfriede=20
Jelinek also first made their mark. He has continued to explore the=20
Austrian psyche and especially the fragile nature of =93reality=94 and =
the=20
political aspects of what society puts forward as such and what it=20
glosses over. The genres he works in range from children=92s books to=20
screenplays, and, most impressively though also more traditionally, to=20=

the seven volumes of Die Archive des Schweigens. This =93Archive of=20
Silence,=94 which comprises a photographic anthology, a collection of=20
essays, a biography and  four novels, is widely considered Roth=92s=20
masterpiece.
      Over the course of his career he has been honored with (among=20
others) the Alfred D=F6blin, Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Peter Rosegger, and=20=

Bruno Kreisky prizes.
	Tristram Wolff graduated from Brown University in 2004. He lives =
in=20
rural Vermont, and travels often. This translation is his first=20
publication.

 >>> CALL FOR PAPERS
 >>> Poetics and Cultural Studies: Engaging the Debate
 >>> Proposed Special Session, Modern Language Association, December 2006

The importance of poetry within the study of literature and the dynamic
resurgence of critical interest in poetry are both reflected in this year's
MLA Program. We would like to propose a Special Session as a precise
adjunct to this moment--a session in which debates can be staged about the
relation of poetics and cultural studies, or the theory of poetry and
sociopolitical accounts of literary culture. How does poetics interface
with cultural studies approaches? Is poetics a term that should be
implicitly or explicitly reserved for aesthetic, formalist and theoretical
studies alone, with cultural studies, postcolonial, global, and other
concerns seen as extrinsic to poetry as literature? Can poetics intersect
with socially and historically exploratory approaches, and how does poetics
provide unique and important sociocultural evidence? We would invite
critics of poetry and poet critics to contribute to a session with four
papers, three accepted to the panel and one a perspective of the
co-organizers. We see this session as specifically addressing the
methodological implications of the current moment in poetics in ways that
connect both to the creation of poetry and to the poetic career.

If interested, please send a 1-2 page proposal and a brief resume to both
co-organizers by March 15.

Subject:      performative violence -- and kindness
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Recent "actualist" moves on this the Lucipo list have caused me to think
this morning once again about the kinds of ethical work performative
violence does and how it relates to the comic mode.

Performative violence, in its playing at ethical transgression, seems to
parallel the kinds of aesthetically transgressive work of AG and PA
writers.

I realized this morning that I'd already formulated something about this
on my blog so I reposted a link on my blog and it can be found here:
http://gabrielgudding.blogspot.com/

But to go further than the blog post: The problem shows up when the
performative writer demands or suggests that the reader respond in a
certain way, demands or suggests that the performative texts/moves be
read in a certain way. "No no you misunderstood me: I was being a
satirist, I was being performative."

What can ensue (if the performative writer is Controlling) is an
exegetical battle about what was said, done, written. These battles are
usually pretty involved and they can again devolve into material for
further actualist performance.

What this stuff calls into stark relief is in fact the kinship between
the aesthetic and the ethical -- and for me the question comes down to
Kindness, the kindness of the writer him or herself. Is that writer
kind? Are they full of blame? How elastic are they? Do they storm away
in a huff? Where do they withdraw from the fray? And how do they
withdraw from the fray? WHO THE WRITER IS becomes an issue: One tries to
see "underneath" the actualist behavior to see if one can find any
PATHOLOGY that would cause such ethically anomalous behavior. [This is a
problem if the project of Writer X is about abrogating the writerly
self] -- [And this becomes a Double Problem if Writer X is also
Controlling].

Upshot: Performative violence is not itself "bad," but it causes us to
become curious about the ethical root of the behavior -- is it good, is
it bad? -- and it throws those who care into a mode of intense waiting
to see fundamentally whether the writer in question is coming from a
standpoint of blame ("I am apart/different/better; you are wrong") or
kinship.

I think one of the beautiful things about this mode can be that it
teaches an intense waiting and tolerance in order to see the "ethical
root." One of the ways a performative writer can fail is to jump into
the fray and say "Read me THIS way!" (We've seen that before on this
list and in blogland stuff from last fall).

Yuh I'm going to go have my breakfast now and get to work.

- Gabe

with strings floating by, on plastic gestures
  until You know how objects demand space;
  You see through it, eventually, knowing things
  noting lives, until objects node gesso polymer,
  and You crack. You crack open like an egg

  and the sunrise dribbles down your bare legs
  when you stand up among men, and women
  whiten to a viscous blur beneath
  the pressure of your hands; You'll choke them
  quiet, tighten the paradox of their breath

hi all,

when we recently published our 30th issue of boog city (with number 31 out
tomorrow) i did one of the things i normally do, update the running list of
poets we've been fortunate enough to publish. i thought i would share it
with you all as a look at one press, and the work that each of nine
different editors--our poetry editors (in order) Joanna Fuhrman, Jim Behrle=
,
Stephanie Young, Carol Mirakove, and Dana Ward, and our special section
editors David Baratier, Arielle Greenberg, Douglas Rothschild, and Deanna
Zandt--has selected. http://boogcity.blogspot.com/

it's been nice throughout these four years that those i respect as writers
and editors, as people first, have been kind enough to lend their time and
effort to get these poems out there. clich=E9 though it is, there's no way i
could ever properly thank them all.

for all my love of publishing features on music, books, politics, and art i=
n
the newspaper, ultimately boog started with poems, published in our first
two chapbooks in august of 1991, and it's poems that continue to define wha=
t
we are.=20

as ever,
david

Subject:      Strange Archive / Possible Dissertation Study / Neglected Poet
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hello,

A few years ago I helped to organize a strange
archive of the recently deceased poet Jeremy Ingalls.

***

Here's a little bio:
Ingalls was a well-known American poet, scholar,
editor and translator. She won the prestigious Yale
Series of Younger Poets Prize in 1940 and published
seventeen books during an active literary career that
spanned five decades. In addition to being a professor
of English, she was also a professor of Asian Studies
at Rockford College before retiring to Tucson in the
early 1960s. Her many honors and awards included the
Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; a
Ford Foundation Fellowship in Asian Studies; a
Fulbright Professor and Rockefeller Foundation
Lecturer in American Poetry in Japan, and an Asia
Foundation delegate to the Republic of Korea. She died
in Tucson in 1999.

***

When I was out in a little used bookstore in Lincoln,
Nebraska a couple of weeks ago I stumbled across a new
edition of Ingalls' gigantic book-length poem called
Tahl, only her second book (if memory serves) after
winning the Yale Prize.  Knopf printed it
orignally--during WWII I think--then it was long out
of print until University of Arizona Press, under the
direction of Alison Hawthorne Deming, re-released it.

The book is huge and strange and pretty amazing.  She
also published a collection of translations of Mao Tse
Tsung's poems called Dragon in Ambush that I helped
locate when I was a research assistant working on the
Ingalls archive at the University of Arizona.

Partly, I mention this to the list because she is a
neglected female American poet--one of the few to
write a massive epic.  And because I think a
dissertation or formal study of her work--of some
kind--would be a great project for somebody looking
for something like this.

But, in thinking about "neglected" writers, I can't
help but be a bit saddened by the thought of all those
boxes (about 80 of them: manuscripts; journals;
personal effects; everything in her office; she never
had a computer, so imagine) sitting in storage in some
wing of the U of A library in Tucson.

If anybody is interested in this, please get in touch
with me.  I'm by no means an authority on Ingalls,
although I spent hours going through her materials
when I was a grad student at U of A.

That said, I'm sure I could help in putting you (or
one of your friends or grad students) in touch with
those who have access to the archive and more detailed
information, etc.  Feel free, of course, to
forward this message to anybody who might be
interested.

my best wishes,
joshua

Ahoy Alex A,
I figure you are either conched out or out there throwing handfuls of
popcorn in the air and letting them rain all over your face because it is
the weekend and that's how we celebrate! Maybe you are doing both, only you
are dreaming the latter. I arrived to a not-so-freezing house at 12:30am vi=
a
bus and porsche. It was not so freezing because we had a pipe burst and the
newton fire dept. came in and turned it off.Then our plumber came and fixed
it. Somebody turned on the heat--that's the great that came out of all this=
.
Perfect timing! The leak dripped out onto the bmw in the garage and our
neighbor noticed there were large ice formations on its trunk. Newton is so
friendly. Hmm, well sorrry I didn't get to talk to you tonight except for t=
o
make fun of your movie choice, I hope you cried and laughed and fell asleep
thoroughly emotioned out. Hope to talk to you tomorrow somewhere between
seeing the large prints of the ancient glass-negatives of Tangier and then
off to the Fogg and then to grandma's house we go.  A busy day, topped off
with drinks with my old friends Bob and Tom. I'll have to get the records
too, but probably Sunday. It's freezing here and I don't know if I'll be
able to shoot at night like I'd planned. It might be the death of me--there
is that big white fur hat though--
Mwah handsome prancing fawn-like boy, I followed you to bed last night
because you made it seem like so much fun, dancing around in your underwear
and crashing:) That's why I still had all my clothes on! You didn't take
them off me. Well, you'll have to make up for it when I get back.  Also wha=
t
happened this morning? All I remember is spelling Tom Tooaaeem. and
"Phonetics with Simona in the morning" could be a
show!

From the Editor:

I sometimes think that Masthead ought to be subtitled "stuff I like". One o=
f
the great satisfactions of putting it together is the opportunity to see
work I admire in conversation with other works, to put in one place a littl=
e
of the great variety of art that stirs me in different ways.  I am sometime=
s
asked if a particular issue has a "theme", but I find myself more intereste=
d
in pursuing the themes that the works themselves suggest. Sometimes the
serendipity of editing means that an issue can look as if, indeed, a theme
has informed the choices; but if so, it is chance who orchestrated it.

Inevitably, the magazine reflects my tastes and interests. And looking at
this issue, I suppose that what strikes me most of all as a connection
between the works presented here is, yet again, a sense of eroticism: the
obvious erotics in the sensual layerings and displacements in the beautiful
artworks of Paul Cava, of course, but also a sense that language is, in a
complex and challenging sense, a bodied phenomenon. This weaves through the
works presented here in a wide variety of ways, from the disturbed
cyber-carnalities of Kenji Siratori to the rawly-nerved longings and
vertiginous anxiety  expressed in Chris Goode's "score for performance";
from the displaced romantic sensibilities of  Flemish poet Hugues C. Pernat=
h
or  Peruvian modernist C=E9sar Vallejo to the tragic eroticism discussed by
playwright and critic George Hunka; from the sheer, tender tissue of the
ordinary in Geoffrey Squires' poetry to the full-blooded sexual anger of
Jasmine Chan's theatrical voice.

I am delighted in this issue to realise a long-held ambition - the Masthead
special for this issue is a survey of Irish poetry,taking in a taste of a
selection of contemporary  poets notable for their variousness, but also
harking back to a modernist lineage which is sometimes obscured in
contemporary narratives of Irish literature.  In editing this selection, I
owe a great deal of thanks to those who helped me with suggestions or with
seeking permissions. I'd particularly like to thank Michael Smith, Trevor
Joyce and David Lloyd for helping me to put this fine selection of  poetry
together, and I'd like to thank also the literary estates of Denis Devlin,
Niall Montgomery, Brian Coffey and Thomas MacGreevy for permitting their
work to appear. The special also includes an essay by Alex Davis which
contextualises some of the vexed issues that both divide and link the whole
notion of Irish poetry.

I am also very pleased to include several texts for the theatre, again
coming from a variety of approaches to language in performance. Margaret
Cameron, Jasmine Chan, Chris Goode, George Hunka and Daniel Keene span thre=
e
continents: the safest thing to say about the works presented here is that
none of these texts in any way fit the convention of the "well made play"
and all of them, in their differing aesthetics, offer exciting ways to thin=
k
about language in performance. And Eliot Finstushel has contributed some
sharp prose, to give this issue a genre edge.


There is, as always, a good body of poetry in translation: in this issue ar=
e
translations from Flemish, Polish, Spanish and Tamil. And the poetry
expresses a range of approaches and aesthetic - from the meditative
reflection of  George Szirtes to MTC Cronin's witty, passionate,
unclassifiable writings, to the complex musical rhythms of Fred Moten.  And
much in between and beyond.

But I'll leave it to you to explore the rest.

This issue's cover image is Man/Woman by Paul Cava, whose work is also
displayed in the Gallery, with extracts from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass=
.
Don't miss the opportunity to read Whitman again: I truly had forgotten, in
the years since I've read him, how wonderful he is.

Yes, stuff I like.

Radical Black and Third World Books, died on 28 February at the 
Whittington Hospital in London. Since the 1950s John had been at the 
forefront of a number of grassroots political and cultural 
organisations striving for racial equality and social justice. 
Originally from Trinidad but living in London for over 40 years, John 
was also a poet, essayist and filmmaker. His brilliant intellect, 
keen sense of humour and geniality touched everyone who met him, and 
he inspired and encouraged people from all walks of life, from all 
over the world. In recent years, John had retired due to heart 
trouble, but he still took an active role as Chairman of the George 
Padmore Institute, introducing many of the events held there. Sadly, 
on 28 February John died of a heart attack at the age of 78. He will 
be greatly missed by everyone. Arrangements are presently being made 
for the funeral of John La Rose. Please email us at 
info@lkjrecords.com if you would like details, but the arrangements 
will also be posted up on this website and at 
www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org

Kenning Editions is proud to announce the first in a series of trade
paperback editions of new poetry:

WHO OPENS by Jesse Seldess.  $12.95  ISBN: 0-9767364-0-3

"The seven poems fit together with a perfect weave, three sets of twins
(in each set, you might read the first as the sounding of themes, the
second as a rhetorical raga exploring them) followed by a coda, as sweet
as it is final. It is impossible not to read these poems aloud &,
sounded, they are magnificent. Jesse Seldess has written a wonderful
book." --Ron Silliman

Jesse Seldess is a Chicago-based poet and literary activist currently
residing in Berlin. Antennae, the small press journal of which he is
editor and publisher, is internationally recognized for publishing
cutting edge writing, music, and performance texts. WHO OPENS is his
first full-length collection.


    Kenning Editions are distributed to individuals and the trade by

    Contact patrickdurgin@earthlink.net for a full prospectus.


Forthcoming titles in the series include:

Ambient Parking Lot, by Pamela Lu. PROSE. Part fiction, part earnest
mockumentary, Ambient Parking Lot follows a band of musicians as they
wander the parking structures of urban downtown and greater suburbia in
quest of the ultimate ambient noise--one that promises to embody their
historical moment and deliver them up to the heights of their
self-important artistry. Along the way, they make sporadic forays into
lyric while contending with doubts, delusions, miscalculations,
mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga peers into the wreckage of a
post-9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy and poignancy of failed
utopia. Pamela Lu is the author of Pamela: A Novel. Her recent work
appears in Biting the Error, 1913, and Fascicle, and is forthcoming in
Chicago Review and call: a review.



Hannah Weiner's Open House, by Hannah Weiner.  Patrick F. Durgin, ed.
POETRY / PERFORMANCE.  Hannah Weiner's influence extends from the
sixties New York avant-garde, where she was part of an unprecedented
confluence of poets, performance and visual artists including Phillip
Glass, Andy Warhol, Carolee Schneeman, John Perrault, David Antin, and
Bernadette Mayer.  Like fellow-traveller Jackson Mac Low, she became an
important part of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E movement of the 70s and 80s, and
her influence can be seen today in the so-called "New Narrative" work
stemming from the San Francisco Bay Area.  With other posthumous
publications of late, her work is being discussed by scholars in
feminist studies, poetics, and disability studies.  But there does not
yet exist a representative selection spanning her decades of poetic
output.  Hannah Weiner's Open House aims to remedy this with previously
uncollected (and mostly never-published) work, including performance
texts, early New York School influenced lyric poems, odes and
remembrances to / of Mac Low and Ted Berrigan, and later "clair-style"
works.



PUREsexSWIFTsex/sexoPUROsexoVELOZ, by Dolores Dorantes; trans. Jen
Hofer.  POETRY (BILINGUAL).  Dolores Dorantes was born in Veracruz and
has lived most of her life in Ciudad Juárez, where socioeconomic
violence and politically-charged daily brutalities have informed her
radically humane and beautifully incisive work as a poet and journalist.
Dorantes is a rare phenomenon among Mexican literary communities, in
that she engages a wide-ranging international stance toward poetry and
poetics while refusing to accept state support from a government she
cannot respect. She has published four book-length works of poetry, and
is founding editor of one of the only truly independent small press
projects in Mexico, Editorial Frugal (Frugal Press) which, among other
activities, publishes Hoja Frugal (The Frugal Page), a monthly poetry
broadside printed in editions of 4000 and distributed free throughout
Mexico. sexoPUROsexoVELOZ, simultaneously a breath of respite and a
galvanizing wind, is a fragmented, interlocking sequence of poems that
explore the divided yet overlapping territories of self and other,
memory and loss, past and possibility. Jen Hofer's translations of
Dorantes' work have appeared in Sin puertas visibles: An Anthology of
Contemporary Poetry by Mexican Women (ed. Jen Hofer, University of
Pittsburgh Press, 2003), War and Peace 2 (ed. Judith Goldman and Leslie
Scalapino, O Books, 2005), Aufgabe (ed. Tracy Grinnell, issue #3),
kenning (ed. Patrick Durgin, issue 13, 2002)  and as a Seeing Eye
chapbook (ed. Guy Bennett, 2004).

Subject:      Octavia Butler and Barbara Guest
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I notice that there is very little about Octavia Butler on the listserv and
I know that her work and character meant a great deal to lots of writers and
thnkers and activists.  Here's what I sent to my friends. . .
Farewell and fire

This feels not so much like a strange year with so many wonderful and
important persons passing on, but possibly a really paradigm shift.  Rosa
Parks and Coretta King; Barbara Guest and  Octavia Butler; Naim June Paik
and   . . .
The consciousness of our mortality is both a blessing and a burden.  We know
that we will die.  So how we live our lives; what we do; how we treat each
other; how we are treated is all bound to our finite moment on the planet.
Yes I know that some believe in the resurrection and karma and all that but
the here and now is the here and now.  HOW ARE WE TO LIVE in this awful
world with our fellow humans who seem to have planned to wreak havoc on the
entire planet?  HOW ARE WE TO MAKE ART in the face of so much evil and
terror and just plain bad management?  How did Ms. Butler and Ms. Guest?
Each day or every other day, pen to paper or fingers on the keyboard.  Or
they walked around the park, the block, across the room, into a library or a
gallery or a house filled with ghosts.  So do we.  There are days when I
fear my very shadow and there are days of such glory--the sun beaming,
diamonds in my ears, my favorite music playing at Prêt a Manger--I know that
this will not last and yet . . .

We are more human because of Ms. Butler and Ms. Guest; Ms. Parks and Ms.
Scott King.  They move in the world unlike anyone before them.  Think of
Octavia Butler writing science fiction.  She was unlike her peers, but she
pulled from the well of African American and African diasporic experience
and found new ways to tell old, horrific tales.  No one did it the way she
did before she did, now her disciples must find their way to tell those
tales.

I remember visiting Barbara Guest sometimes in the 1980s when she was on W.
16 or 15th, no it was 16th street.  There were like a million books of
course in her space, but also all kinds of art quietly abstract, a kind of
humming of lines and colors here and there.   I wish I remembered more.  She
was generous and rigorous and her work to me remains difficult to
understand, but I utterly respected what she was trying to do because like
Octavia Butler she also had to find her way to make art in response to her
experience and interests-painting, psychology, feminism.

These gentle women make the background hum that is history --that we sort of
hear and when these artists and activists, mothers and daughters, dreamers
and revolutionaries pass on, we are left with a great responsibility--to try
and match their fire or to find a way to start our own.

In honor of their gifts,

Patricia Spears Jones

I was conducting research at the Lilly Library this morning and discovered
something about the Eliot-Pound correspondence that I had not known.  I
wrote about it in my blog: http://blog.myspace.com/orthodontist   If anyone
has an answer to my 'small mystery', please let me know; I'm very curious.

AS we move from poetry to data, correspondence to PR, poets to "authors
of ## books of poetry" the integrity of the art world continues to
diminish. So much attention on numbers, syntax, on metrics, it is like
another . . . .

Be Well, Derek

This Sunday, before the Oscars, we roll our the red carpet for Loren
Goodman and Carson Cistulli. Join us for the last installment of our
poetry series to be held in the current space. Since many of you have
plans for the rest of the evening, we'll begin promptly. Tea scones,
and drinks with the poets to follow. R.S.V.P., $7 at the door.


Loren Goodman was born and raised in Wichita, Kansas, and graduated
from Columbia University in 1991. His book, Famous Americans, was the
2003 selection for the Yale Younger Poets Series, edited by W.S.
Merwin. Robert Creeley said of the book, "Famous last words for this
terrific book are hard to come by, but one such would be
'Wonderful!'... Famous Americans is my kind of people." Mr. Goodman's
poetry and criticism have appeared in Poetry and Artforum. He lives in
Texas and Kobe, Japan, where he is a translator of English and Japanese
literature, and according to his publicist, "active in the martial arts."
Carson Cistulli attended Columbia University and the University of
Montana. His poetry has appeared in The Hat and Can We Have Our Ball
Back, and was included in the 2005 collection Free Radicals: American
Poets Before Their First Books, edited by Jordan Davis and Sarah
Manguso. He is currently pursuing an MFA in poetry at the University
of Massachusetts.

i thought the same thing when i saw this post yesterday christine. but then
i realized that in lungfull the authors explain their work in the back mixed
in with their bios, and sometimes not at all, just putting a bio.

perhaps poem, revised will have the author explanations mandatory, mixed in
with the work, and lengthier. maybe by calling poems, revised a teaching
tool they intend to have exercises interspersed within the book.

A few things have been forwarded to me in the last day/two that give me a
great sense of alarm about the future of academic freedom. I have heard som=
e
conservative politicians say that the next attack on the left will occur in
institutions of higher learning, so I'm wondering, since I haven't been in =
a
classroom in a few years, if anyone on the list feels affected by this.

I'm also wondering- how expansive are teachers/professors' first amendment
rights?=20

First, a high school teacher criticizing US foreign policy is recorded by
one of his students and subsequently suspended.

Kerri,

Multiple ways it can be felt, too. Academic freedom is a non-issue when =20=

50-80% of the academic workforce is part-time, contingent, temp, =20
flexible, etc., as it is for most colleges and universities these days. =20=

The new buzzword coming out of increasingly corporatized institutions =20=

is "accountability" which translates to the right's project of =20
containing sixties movements and capital's project of recomposing =20
itself internationally via the takeover of "knowledge industries" (this =20=

last plagiarized from a Richard Ohmann article that lays out the =20
project pretty well). The squeeze is definitely on, but it's also true =20=

that higher ed is now home to a pretty active labor movement, which may =20=

bode well for some...

If you are interest in shaping a possible 'arts' chapter at CBS NEWS next
Friday night, You can cast a vote for a segment covering the fantastic,
avant musician and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain. Read more about him in
the email I received from Charles Amirkhanian  (below). Simple way to vote
is to go here:

Dear Steve,

Thanks for your continued interesting posts.  I wonder if you would
be inclined to help me with something.

Yesterday I picked up Daniel Bernard Roumain at the Oakland Airport.
He's doing a concert for Other Minds on Monday night at the JCCSF of
his works for string quartet dedicated to Civil Rights leaders he
admires.  DBR mentioned to me that CBS Evening News that night (last
night) would be running a very short profile of him and two others
and that the audience would vote on who would be profiled in full
next Friday on the CBS Evening News.  If he is selected (by Monday
morning-the voting goes on all weekend at the CBS News website) CBS
News will send a crew to the Jewish Community Center of SF on Monday
night to include the Other Minds concert in their profile of Daniel
next Friday.

I write in the hope that you would consider
passing this on to some friends to get some more votes for this
amazing composer.  He plays classical violin, electric violin, piano,
etc. and got a PhD in composition from the U. of Michigan.  But his
own music sounds like Phil Glass, Shostakovitch, hiphop, Bartok and
funk mixed together.  It's truly unique.

Hope you can help!

Thanks for considering it.

Sincerely,

Charles

Thanks Bill and Kerri for bringing this stuff up.

I know what you mean Bill, but I personally wouldn't phrase academic freedo=
m
as a "non-issue" because of these other issues. Instead, I see the temp,
contingency, issue as the same as the academic freedom one. The
"accountability" buzzword, especially when it comes to the less quantifiabl=
e
knowledges, disciplines, what-have-you, in a cultural climate in which
"efficiency" is valued to the extent that what was once called "imagination=
"
is now often seen as a symptom of Attention Deficit Disorder (okay, not in
every case), is reflected in an increased policing on a departmental
level---and a sometimes rather twisted use of "doublespeak" as issues of
"freedom" often get couched in terms of "professionalism" and "standards"
defined in increasingly monolithic ways, despite some decorative
nomenclature differences.

Perhaps the burgeoning labor movement can be persuaded to address some of
these less "obvious" aspects of the situation.

Chris

yes, it surely--everything you talk about here--can make teaching a new
form of suffering...  paula gunn allen says the university sucks our
souls, and we stand between the university and our students (or high

jensen's _walking on water_ last semester.  now taking a break...  gabe

Most average Americans work long hard hours to just survive without
sabbaticals, or even vacations the life of a tenure track professor is =
as
far away from most Americans realities as the life Oprah Winfrey lives. =
They
are facing layoffs and stagnant incomes and financial problems and high
taxes.=20

To go to a large state university in this country costs more than =
$15,000 a
year a private U more than $35,000 and for many Americans there are only
loans to pay for this education and they deserve to get their money's =
worth.
The average college education has gone up 145% in price since 1985 no =
other
commodity in our society has gone up that much in 20 years. Not oil, not
Gold, not Milk not Eggs.=20

Most people go to college to get trained to get a job not to hear
professor's opinions. When average Americans hear about things like full
professors not teaching undergrads or when Professors are frankly =
arrogant
and not open minded it opens the door for this kind of critique many
academics live in a dreamworld called college towns that is very far =
from
mainstreet USA where the money is coming from. =20

If you want to know where the Adjunct problem comes from it comes from =
our
society which respects no skill and no craft we respect only the mighty
dollar. Professor's jobs are going to the same place where Steelworkers,
Carworkers, Textile Workers and many other outsourced professions have =
gone
because Americans don=92t want to pay the price needed for quality that =
is
made at home with benefits this is the fault of all Americans.=20

But I do not want to hear complants about the outsourcing of academic =
jobs
where were the professors when places like Wilmington, NC and Flint
Michigan, and Topeka, Kansas watched their jobs being outsourced because
Americans wanted cheaper prices?=20

You talk about academic freedom? What about who pays the bills and gets =
none
of the benefits?=20

Thanks Bill and Kerri for bringing this stuff up.

I know what you mean Bill, but I personally wouldn't phrase academic =
freedom
as a "non-issue" because of these other issues. Instead, I see the temp,
contingency, issue as the same as the academic freedom one. The
"accountability" buzzword, especially when it comes to the less =
quantifiable
knowledges, disciplines, what-have-you, in a cultural climate in which
"efficiency" is valued to the extent that what was once called =
"imagination"
is now often seen as a symptom of Attention Deficit Disorder (okay, not =
in
every case), is reflected in an increased policing on a departmental
level---and a sometimes rather twisted use of "doublespeak" as issues of
"freedom" often get couched in terms of "professionalism" and =
"standards"
defined in increasingly monolithic ways, despite some decorative
nomenclature differences.

Perhaps the burgeoning labor movement can be persuaded to address some =
of
these less "obvious" aspects of the situation.

Chris

FREE THE P! PALESTINE TAKES NYC'S EAST VILLAGE BY STORM
Remi Kanazi, The Electronic Intifada, 17 October 2005

As I walk down the darkened staircase into a muggy
basement in this lower eastside dive bar, a scruffily
bearded supporter smiles and waves a four-foot wide
Palestinian flag. The chatter begins as the room fills
with anxious people awaiting the show. The young crowd
came out to support Free the P, the new CD compilation of
"hip-hop and spoken word, dedicated to the youth of
Palestine." The proceeds will go to Slingshot Hip-hop, "a
documentary film that focuses on the daily life of
Palestinian rappers living in Gaza, the West Bank and
inside Israel." Within moments, our hostess, Arab-American
comedienne Maysoon Zayid, takes the ground level,
makeshift stage and gets the crowd going with her dry,
political humor....

stay away from politics. We do not accept this. We want to shake things

compilation CD, titled "Free the P," brings together over 20 hip-hop and

and feloniously fabricate propaganda to mislead the world and American
people that Iraq has "Weapons of Mass Destruction", and will use them on
America. Evidence to validate this fantasy still to this day does not
exist, even after the CIA unsuccessfully tried to fabricate documents to
prove so. Next we have the shameful attempt by Governor Bush and his
gang to link the unfortunate events of September 11th and Osama Bin
Laden to the leadership of the Iraqi Government. Proof or evidence of
which also does not exist. Mr. Bush has been left with no other card in
his deck to play, so he created his own, the deck of "Wanted Terrorists"
within a charade of humanitarianism. The only way for him to gain any
popular acceptance is to have a campaign of misleading propaganda to
make us believe that he's on a self-righteous mission to liberate the
Iraqi people, and that this war is a war about freedom and democracy for
the people of Iraq. This is yet another delusion of grandeur by our
so-called fearless leader. He will not hoodwink or deceive us! America's
oppressive foreign policy, which resorts to bribery, corruption, dirty
dealings, and murder assassination, will continue to produce hatred,
mistrust, and animosity. This dangerous environment that our policies
have bred puts us at far greater risk of being blind sided and harmed by
threats unknown. This threat multiplies with each aggression toward the
nations of the world. Aggression sometimes concealed behind diplomacy,
which can be more dangerous than war itself. This hostile behavior must
stop. If we are going to start opening the books and passing judgment on
world leaders lets not hesitate to start with members of our government.
Let's also call out the governments of some our so-called allies. Then
we can all be playing eye-to-eye on an even field. Until then, take a
stand to S.T.O.P. the oppressive politics. Stop the killing of other
nation's children and bring our sons and daughters home.

Oh, hey, Kerri, Bill, Chris, & Gabe,

=20
Now, especially for those in adjunct/cross/over posts--positions of both =

demands of work with no compensation.

On the other hand, such workers certainly labor in charmed conditions
when compared to so many, others,  eh?--even if they somehow also earned =

that by being student laborers for years in order to do so.

That is "endemic." =20

It's helpful to recall now how much it costs today to put oneself=20
through college to the point of being able to teach at college.

Student loan companies are your best friend--until you cannot find a =
job,
eh?

In that, universities seem to be screwing themselves and their =

Yet it is also very much just *business as usual*=20

Thanks for the discussion on academic freedom.  As Bill points out,
there is a lot happening in the academic labor movement, but labor
movement need not be linked solely to the bureaucratic architecture
of the union.  While I'm "pro union" (burp), I'm also painfully aware
that it -- at least where I am teaching now -- FEELS like an extra
arm of management. (I can describe my evidence for this privately,
but suffice it to say that assessment is worthless without
compliance, and compliance is hard to achieve, like herding cats,
without disciplinary agents.) And the only thing worse is asking the
students what they think. I say this as someone on "the student's
side" -- but not because they are "customers" or "human capital" as
the World Bank describes them (see Beyond English Inc.).

As the editorial committee addressing the Wildcat strike at the Dodge
Truck plant in Warren, MIchigan, in the early 70s, points out: it was
the union that called the cops to remove the striking workers from
their own meeting space. My worry is that once you sign-on to the
union program, you simply consent to having another set of bosses.
And, in my defense, I put "FEELING" above simply to imply that it's a
FEELING and not something real (like academic treatments of
alienation, for example) to prevent me from being upbraided by union
folks who would take issue with this complaint.

In addition to the whimsy of hiring, "non-reappointment," and all
that, adjuncts, temps, contingent academic laborers are often held
hostage by student evaluations, etc. A friend here (W. PA) in
sociology linked the student culture of reticence in the classroom to
the oppression of miners by authorities, dating back 80-100 years.
"When you get to college, keep your mouth shut, as your professor
won't like what we stand for," etc.  So, this cuts both ways. Though
I find it disconcerting, to say the least, I'm not sure I accept this
thesis, although I find students from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are
often a lot more active in speaking their minds, or running afoul of
a professor's politics, whether right or left. This is an issue
currently being debated in the Pennsylvania assembly, since it was
the only state to take up Horowitz's "academic freedom" proposal.
I've been reading about his debates with various faculty on his cross-
country tours, and would be interested to find a bibliography/list of
these various debates. Apparently the one at Reed turned into total
chaos, with "ad hominem" attacks, the moderator leaving the room, etc.

Bill didn't say it, but these issues are fast becoming the central
concern of Factory School through various activities, mostly in the
realm of publishing. One of our projects is to foment the
organization of editorial committees to challenge the hegemony of
corporate (university press and conglomerate) publishing racket, from
the false prestige, extortion of junior faculty, to the  hijacking of
tenure hijinks through mythologies of "peer reviewing" -- anyone who
has ever been negatively peer reviewed by an "outside" (?) reader
will know what I'm talking about: faux professionalism masquerading
the gangsterism in academic culture. The sooner we realize that, and
do something to construct our own sense of agency in this regard, the
sooner we can get on with our work. This is one of the means by which
disciplinary boundaries are policed in real, concrete terms. This is
to say nothing of the hardship 50 dollar textbooks create for
students who have less expendable income. How much of the state-
financed underwriting of corporate textbook profits is laundered
through student loans?

Wanna talk? Wanna help?  Wanna get involved? Please contact me and
Bill as we're putting together a proposal for "what to do and how to
do it" -- a phrase lifted from Facing Reality, a book which has
become so important to me that I'm willing to break the law in order
to get a copy in your hands.

Hopefully anyone at 4Cs in Chicago this year will come to our
workshop on Wednesday morning and the Works & Days publication party
on Friday night (that's at UIC) celebrating a new issue dedicated to
the work of Richard Ohmann, cited by Bill in his plagiary. Edited by
David Downing at IUP, Works & Days is a journal which stretches from
Cultural and Technology Studies to what can perhaps be described as
"institutional critique" -- an area of interest of many on this list,
for sure.

Thanks for listening!

I'm not sure who you're wanting to implicate in this little post, but the
sweeping generalizations don't serve your argument well. There are all sorts
of university teaching jobs. Here, for instance, there are no sabbaticals.
The summer break is quite wonderful though. Three months with all the time
one could want and no pay. This summer I'm teaching.

Arrogant and not open-minded people are all over the place, in all manner of
jobs. As for the college town dream world, I suppose one can call the
classroom a dream world of sorts, but once one steps out the door, I can't
see as how one could continue to live in said dream world. Are you
suggesting a liberal dream in a conservative world? If so, at least in the
university town in which I live, this is not the case. The town mirrors the
rest of the state. And the university itself is not a lock-step liberal
dream.

Here you say Americans don't want to pay the price, while above you state
that Americans aren't getting their money's worth. A quality university
experience is a difficult thing to quantify, and those who work as adjuncts
and those who work as full professors are not all good or bad within that
experience. The problem with adjuncts is very low pay and no job security. I
did that for several years before getting picked up full time.

Yes, and where were the flight attendants? Where were the lumberjacks? Where
were the caribou? The very stones themselves should rise and picket. But of
course if I say something to this effect, I will be accused of being
arrogant and not open-minded.

>You talk about academic freedom? What about who pays the bills and gets

We all pay the bills. 20 years ago, the state funded roughly 75% of most
university educations. Now it pays less than 50%. At least that's the case
in Missouri. I suspect it is similar in other places? Starting salary for a
tenure-track professor in English is usually less than $45,000 (I'm making
less than that, while my brother who works for Kraft is making more than
double that). Health insurance for a family of four here is just under
$800.00 a month. There are many things in this world for which people are
paying and for which they are getting little in return.

ORBITAL SERIES

SCHABLONE BERLIN: an evening with Caroline Koebel and Kyle Schlesinger
Mutimedia presentation, reading and book launch
Thursday, March 9, 7 p.m.
Big Orbit Gallery, 30 d Essex St.
Free

ABOUT THE BOOK: SCHABLONE BERLIN is an artist's book as well as a book of
documentation, presenting stencil graffiti from the streets of contemporary=
 Berlin. The
book consists of over 100 color photographs showing not only the graffiti, =
but also its
placement within the confines of Germany's most international metropolis. T=
he
introduction examines the semiotic and performative aspects of stencil graf=
fiti within
the contexts of art history, media and urban anthropology.

=22This art and text project by Caroline Koebel and Kyle Schlesinger is a l=
oving drift
through the streets of Berlin to examine and to be inspired by its raw, liv=
ely, lustful,
sometimes esoteric stencil culture. Exquisitely photographed, this work pla=
ys in the in
betweens of poetics and politics, the trivial and the insightful, the amusi=
ng and the
disturbing, the immediate and the aloof. One way or another, this book will=
 seduce
you=22

--Critical Art Ensemble.

Bios : An interdisciplinary artist, Caroline Koebel utilizes video, film, a=
nd installation for
their distinct attributes as modes of storytelling and for the enactment of=
 subjectivities
at odds with commercial culture. Kyle Schlesinger is a poet, scholar and ty=
pographer
currently investigating the history and ontology of book burning.=00

Kyle and Caroline will also teach a multimedia workshop in April:

Subject:      update: WHO OPENS by Jesse Seldess online ordering
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

It's come to my attention that the link to the direct credit card ordering from the kenning editions homepage is flawed.  However, for administrative reasons, it can't be immediately corrected.  Interested parties should refer to the kenning page at grimsey records to order the book directly from the press:  www.grimsey.com/kenning.html

Or, you may purchase it and all other available Kenning Editions titles from SPD's website:  www.spdbooks.org

Here's the rundown of Kenning wares at SPD:

WHO OPENS, by Jesse Seldess.  Poetry. Jesse Seldess is a Chicago-based poet and the editor-publisher of the internationally recognized journal Antennae. This is his first full-length collection. "It is impossible not to read these poems aloud &, sounded, they are magnificent"--Ron Silliman. "With great compassion and precision, this book returns language to the habitat of sound from which poetry has been away far too long"--Kerri Sonnenberg.

SYRUP HITS, by David Larsen.  Intended as the "remix" of David Larsen's poetry collection THE THORN, the chapbook SYRUP HITS offers a meditative funhouse ride through phantom landscapes of the modern Middle East and southern United States. Its collaged pages are loosely gathered around the misadventures of a codeine abuser named Puzz, who is stationed at Abu Ghrayb during the first months of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Endpapers are individually block-printed and hand-tinted by the artist; contents are a bracing throwback to the days before Photoshop, and a reminder of the still-dramatic possibilities offered by scissors, glue and Papermate Flair pens. "Amazing. Some of the best use of collage I've ever seen, and my favorite handwriting since Whalen"--Gary Sullivan.

COUNTRY GIRL, by Hannah Weiner.  COUNTRY GIRL is the first publication of the second of four journals legendary poet-performer Hannah Weiner composed, and which culminated in the hugely influential Clairvoyant Journal. Continuing from THE FAST (available from SPD), this book begins to chart the development of the poetic form mastered in the Clairvoyant Journal performances which can be heard on KENNING 12 / WAY (available from SPD). But it also tells an intriguing tale of the development of a peculiarly vexed self-consciousness made critical, political, and selfless through writing / language itself. An important work handsomely edited and published by poet and Weiner scholar Patrick F. Durgin, who provides a brief "Editor's Note." Weiner's other books from SPD include PAGE and WE SPEAK SILENT.

HOVERCRAFT, by K. Silem Mohammad. Poetry. A challenging, post-everything serial poem, HOVERCRAFT is a chapbook by emerging poet K.Silem Mohammad, now in its fourth edition. It is a long serial poem in reply to a signal epigraph to the book from a poem by Carl Rakosi. Mohammad picks "up the signet of these hanging contras / and bale[s] into words." The result is a book which resists safe nomenclature such as 'post-language' or 'nth generation New York'. Nor does it perform an exercise of reconciliation of whatever these schools sponsor by way of influence, be it a re-politicized Objectivism or an American sublime in the quotidian. Writing in Cross-CulturalPoetics #8, critic and scholar Maria Damon calls HOVERCRAFT "a beautiful and lyrical politicization of the contemporary act of writing."

KENNING's 12th issue is a double-CD with sound works by three generations of innovative poets and musicians. Disc one is a "newsletter" disc with contributions from Allen Ginsberg, Eileen Miles, Andrew Levy & Gerry Hemingway, Anne-Marie Albiach, Bruce Andrews, Edwin Torres, Sawako Nakayasu, Amiri Baraka, and many others. Disc two is the first audio edition of renowned poet Leslie Scalapino's book-length poem WAY (available in print from SPD). This is a new studio recording of WAY and, along with every other contribution to KENNING #12, it is featured here exclusively. This issue of KENNING also features a rare archival recording of Hannah Weiner et al reading from the Clarvoyant Journal (at St. Mark's Poetry Project) as well as new music from underground musicians Akemi, Seacreature, and Colossus & Guardian.

Kenning #10 -- Grounded in the belief that poetry and poetics comprise a vital facet of "progressive social discourse," this tenth issue of KENNING features writing by George Albon & Steve Carll, Jen Hofer, Amiri Baraka, Oskar Pastior (translated by Rosmarie Waldrop), Mary Rising Higgins, Stephen Ratcliffe, Ben Friedlander, Craig Dworkin, Elizabeth Treadwell, and others. It also includes reviews of Renee Gladman's JUICE and Raymond Federman's A Voice in the Closet.

A colorful last "newsletter" issue of KENNING, #13 includes new poetry, cultural writing, and a special column on "critical paranoia" involving three generations of poets and critics. Contributors include Robert Creeley, Andrew Levy, Elizabeth Treadwell, Dolores Dorantes (trans. Jen Hofer), Brian Kim Stefans, Susan Schultz, Nathaniel Tarn, Kit Robinson, Terrence Chiusano and David Larsen. Also featured are reviews of Lusk, Tran, Biglieri and a special insert by Zukofsky scholar Thom Donovan. Edited by Patrick F. Durgin. 82 pages.

the avg. assistant professor (all disciplines) here at illinois state
university (isu) earns $50,600 annually...

the avg. full professor (all disciplines) at university of illinois
at urbana-champaign (uiuc) earns $105,800 annually...

(these stats courtesy of my union, iae/nea...)

english being among the lower paid of the academic disciplines, you
can figure that salaries in the sciences and technology fields
generally tend to be higher than these numbers...

there are vast (vast) disparities when we talk about higher ed and
its wages, teaching loads, perks, accommodations, etc... to compare
the avg. assistant at isu (a 3rd-tier institution) with the avg. full
prof at uiuc (currently ranked 42nd in the nation among national u's,
i believe) is clearly to compare apples and oranges, but it's my way
of trying to foreground what's at stake here...

isu and uiuc are separated, after all, by only a 45-minute drive over
agribiz flatland (so much for geographical homogeneities)... and both
are state institutions (so much for state-institutional
homogeneities)... the publish-or-perish factor at uiuc is
considerably more intense than at isu, but it's nonetheless at work
in both institutions (i've taught at both institutions)... the
teaching load is higher here at isu, for tenure-track faculty, than
at uiuc...

this is an old, old argument on this list, at any rate... i'm not
certain, but i think i had this argument on this list more than a
decade ago now... trying to defend academics is one thing, trying to
defend academic freedom is quite another, and trying to poke holes in
intellectual culture is easy as pie... there are foolish academics,
to be sure, and foolish factory workers, foolish union policies and
practices and foolish admin policies and practices... it's a
testament to just how fucked things are here in the u.s. that we can
divide ourselves up into autonomous labor collectives courtesy of a
few ill-informed rhetorical gestures, and i'm certain that the
neoliberal right is very pleased to see this kind of squabbling, for
that matter...

if it's the hypocrisies/abuses of academic culture one is after, i'm
with you---we could stand to do better... for my money, for instance,
academic culture is simply not confrontational enough... an odd claim
on the surface of it, perhaps, but my sense is that this is why so
much of what we academics do takes such circuitous routes... and
while i stand in favor of tenure, i do believe that tenure is often
granted -- and denied -- on questionable grounds (i always feel i
need to come clean when i say such things, so ok:  i've been denied
twice now)... a little sunshine on our more arcane practices would
help, surely,, and would help the public to understand us
better---but then, that might be too *blunt* a way of putting it...

and then again, let's have a close look at the hypocrisies of the
various pursuits that are (rather) obscured here on the list... i
spent a number of years in fortune 500, and it would be relatively
easy for me to draw a picture of same, which would begin thus:
$$$... and i mean, like, you wouldn't want profs to have LESS
academic freedom, would you?... nobody here is arguing for the
eradication of higher ed, are they?... nobody wants to see *more*
privatization of higher ed, do they?... i hate to burst anyone's
balloon, but diatribes against the abuses of theory in the ives, or
the left-wing conspiracy of chaucer scholars, have very little to do
in actuality with the works and days of most english profs -- by
which i mean most english profs in the ivies, and most chaucer
scholars...

c'mon now, 'fess up... what's the *real* issue here?---misplaced
professional envy?... b/c that's what it sounds like... either that,
or we're working with some relatively impoverished notions of what it
means to teach -- and publish -- for a living... and oh, hey, a bit
more personal detail, as is my wont, just to anchor this post some:
i grossed a little over $26,000 last year, and my spouse here clocked
in at $48,000 on the isu tenure-track, a coupla grand shy of that
avg, above... i'm sure we've got some non-academic folks here on the
list hauling in a good deal more jack than that...

that i've chosen this profession, at any rate, means that i ought to
be able to criticize it, to ask it to do better, w/o that effort
being denigrated, esp. by those who exhibit little actual knowledge
of how it works...

best,

I've been fascinated by this thread.=20

 As a freshman, I directed my studies toward a degree in Education, =
aspiring ultimately to someday hold a post as Professor in any Ivy =
League (my eastern shore birthing, no doubt influenced then that choice) =
center for higher learning.  And, back then...WOW!...more than forty =
years ago...I joined the NEA my senior year.  I loved the parallel to =
the AMA.  I was a member of a professional association.  I would be held =
to a peer standard.  I would be subjected to peer review; I would be =
assisted by and guided by others who had gone before me and paved the =
way for future educators to contribute to the profession. =20

Then, I entered the work force as an English Teacher; five years into my =
career, the NEA became a Union.  The AMA parallel was swept away in an =
instant, and with it, the impression that educators were professionals.  =
As union members, teachers became just another worker-bee in the system =
of skilled and unskilled laborers.  The image of that Ivy League =
professor shifted in my mind.  He was no longer a respected =
professional; he was just another man doing a job to earn a salary, buy =
his bread and wine and feed his family. =20

I left the field of Education.  If all I was going to be was just =
another worker-bee, I was going to go to work someplace where I earned a =
living wage...that wasn't in Education back then.  Don't know if that's =
true today, because I've no idea who earns what. =20

I'm neither pro union nor anti union...I merely felt back then, and =
still hold to that belief today, that members of a profession are not =
members of a union.  I confess, that may be an idealistic and out dated =
attitude.=20

In any case, whether you view yourselves as professionals or mere grunt =
laborers, you must expect both: to be held accountable for and to be =
measured against some standard for your performance.=20

Accountability and assessment are not words you should fear.  Rather =
they are values for which you should set personal standards of =
achievement.   Do any of you truly not want to be held accountable for =
your actions?  And my guess is you all as faculty members assess the =
efforts of others, students and peers (though the peer assessment is =
probably a behind the back rather than up-front effort).  Why shouldn't =
you expect to have your efforts assessed as well? =20

  Subject: academic freedom and other discounted specials


  Thanks for the discussion on academic freedom.  As Bill points out, =20
  there is a lot happening in the academic labor movement, but labor =20
  movement need not be linked solely to the bureaucratic architecture =20
  of the union.  While I'm "pro union" (burp), I'm also painfully aware  =

  that it -- at least where I am teaching now -- FEELS like an extra =20
  arm of management. (I can describe my evidence for this privately, =20
  but suffice it to say that assessment is worthless without =20
  compliance, and compliance is hard to achieve, like herding cats, =20
  without disciplinary agents.) And the only thing worse is asking the =20
  students what they think. I say this as someone on "the student's =20
  side" -- but not because they are "customers" or "human capital" as =20
  the World Bank describes them (see Beyond English Inc.).

  As the editorial committee addressing the Wildcat strike at the Dodge  =

  Truck plant in Warren, MIchigan, in the early 70s, points out: it was  =

  the union that called the cops to remove the striking workers from =20
  their own meeting space. My worry is that once you sign-on to the =20
  union program, you simply consent to having another set of bosses. =20
  And, in my defense, I put "FEELING" above simply to imply that it's a  =

  FEELING and not something real (like academic treatments of =20
  alienation, for example) to prevent me from being upbraided by union =20
  folks who would take issue with this complaint.

  In addition to the whimsy of hiring, "non-reappointment," and all =20
  that, adjuncts, temps, contingent academic laborers are often held =20
  hostage by student evaluations, etc. A friend here (W. PA) in =20
  sociology linked the student culture of reticence in the classroom to  =

  the oppression of miners by authorities, dating back 80-100 years. =20
  "When you get to college, keep your mouth shut, as your professor =20
  won't like what we stand for," etc.  So, this cuts both ways. Though =20
  I find it disconcerting, to say the least, I'm not sure I accept this  =

  thesis, although I find students from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are  =

  often a lot more active in speaking their minds, or running afoul of =20
  a professor's politics, whether right or left. This is an issue =20
  currently being debated in the Pennsylvania assembly, since it was =20
  the only state to take up Horowitz's "academic freedom" proposal. =20
  I've been reading about his debates with various faculty on his cross- =

  country tours, and would be interested to find a bibliography/list of  =

  these various debates. Apparently the one at Reed turned into total =20
  chaos, with "ad hominem" attacks, the moderator leaving the room, etc.

  Bill didn't say it, but these issues are fast becoming the central =20
  concern of Factory School through various activities, mostly in the =20
  realm of publishing. One of our projects is to foment the =20
  organization of editorial committees to challenge the hegemony of =20
  corporate (university press and conglomerate) publishing racket, from  =

  the false prestige, extortion of junior faculty, to the  hijacking of  =

  tenure hijinks through mythologies of "peer reviewing" -- anyone who =20
  has ever been negatively peer reviewed by an "outside" (?) reader =20
  will know what I'm talking about: faux professionalism masquerading =20
  the gangsterism in academic culture. The sooner we realize that, and =20
  do something to construct our own sense of agency in this regard, the  =

  sooner we can get on with our work. This is one of the means by which  =

  disciplinary boundaries are policed in real, concrete terms. This is =20
  to say nothing of the hardship 50 dollar textbooks create for =20
  students who have less expendable income. How much of the state-=20
  financed underwriting of corporate textbook profits is laundered =20
  through student loans?

  Wanna talk? Wanna help?  Wanna get involved? Please contact me and =20
  Bill as we're putting together a proposal for "what to do and how to =20
  do it" -- a phrase lifted from Facing Reality, a book which has =20
  become so important to me that I'm willing to break the law in order =20
  to get a copy in your hands.

  Hopefully anyone at 4Cs in Chicago this year will come to our =20
  workshop on Wednesday morning and the Works & Days publication party =20
  on Friday night (that's at UIC) celebrating a new issue dedicated to =20
  the work of Richard Ohmann, cited by Bill in his plagiary. Edited by =20
  David Downing at IUP, Works & Days is a journal which stretches from =20
  Cultural and Technology Studies to what can perhaps be described as =20
  "institutional critique" -- an area of interest of many on this list,  =

  for sure.

  Thanks for listening!

How does this differ from Lungfull?  This project is an anthology.  Lungfull is a magazine.

perhaps poem, revised will have the author explanations mandatory, mixed in

just to add (after long applause for joe amoto's post) that
"accountability" is here (or by me at least) not being used
interchangeably with "assessment" -- the question of accountability
(more structural, systemic) is more about regents, trustees (the boards
of which have been dominated by business interests since the late 19th
c.), conservative foundations and interest groups, etc., making
teachers and "knowledge workers" (now citing Ohmann legitimately)
accountable TO THEM, i.e., more responsive to their purposes, their
project. -- and they're quite organized to do it. stressing the
importance of getting students "trained" for a long life of flex-work
is, of course, part of that project.

 Greetings,
 AT&T and BellSouth, two of the largest telecom companies, just announced
plans to merge into a media monopoly. This deal must be stopped.
 The merger resurrects the Ma Bell monopoly that was busted up in 1984. But
it's far worse today. These companies no longer just control telephone
calls. They want to become gatekeepers to all digital media -- television,
telephone and Internet -- at prices that many Americans can't afford.
 The merger is now in the hands of the FCC, FTC and Congress. They'll
rubber-stamp the deal unless the public speaks up. It's time to tell
Washington:
 *Stop the Merger Now. Do Not Allow a New Media
Monopoly*<http://action.freepress.net/campaign/stopatt>
.
 Giant media companies have failed us on all fronts. They have failed to
provide access to all communities. They have stifled and squelched
competition, eliminating choices in the marketplace. They have failed to
bridge the digital divide, leaving America far behind other countries. They
have failed to open their networks to local and independent content
creators. They have failed to protect net freedoms that keep the Internet a=
n
open road for all.

We need real competition and a choice of innovative communications services=
.
It's time to turn back the new tide of media consolidation.
 *Stop the AT&T Merger Now* <http://action.freepress.net/campaign/stopatt>*=
.
*
 Send your letter to Washington -- before it's too late.
 Onward,
 Timothy Karr
Campaign Director
Free Press
 P.S. -- The merger is the largest yet among U.S. telecom players. AT&T,
already the nation's largest telecommunications company, will become the
largest broadband provider with nearly 10 million subscribers. Both AT&T an=
d
BellSouth execs have publicly flirted with plans to undermine the freedoms
that keep the internet open to all. Learn more at www.netfreedomnow.org.

Those who haven't caught up with the controversy on the

production of My Name is Rachel Corrie by the New York Theatre Workshop can
do so from my blog - http://theatrenotes.blogspot.com - where links will

The best response so far by playwright Walter A Davis at Counterpunch on the
Rachel Corrie controversy at the New York Theatre Workshop - many thanks to
George Hunka for the link -

http://www.counterpunch.org/davis03062006.html

In part:

The purpose of serious theatre can be       stated simply-to challenge the
audience to examine everything       that they don't want to face about
themselves and their world.        Theatre is that public space with a
unique purpose: the public       airing of secrets.  Other public
institutions (Churches, Political       forums, the Media)  are dedicated
primarily to something else:       the celebration and perpetuation of
ideology, the programming       of a mass audience with the beliefs, ideas,
and feelings they       need to internalize so that ideology will secure its
grand function.        That function: the creation within subjects of the
conditions       that make it impossible for them to understand their
historical       situation.  Freedom, if there is such a thing, depends on
overcoming       the vast weight of ideological beliefs that have colonized
one's       heart and mind.

The artist is the bad conscience       of a society who calls ideology into
question by representing       all the ways in which it poisons our lives.
The role of serious       drama is to represent the disorders of its time
not in order       to relieve or "cathart" our dilemmas but to make it
impossible for us to any longer ignore them.  Rilke's "You       must change
your life" is the "message" that any       great drama delivers as a blow to
the psyche of its audience.        To appropriate a phrase from Albee, the
purpose of serious drama       is to "get the guests."  And not I add
primarily by       getting them to change their ideas about some current
political       and social situation.  Serious drama strikes much deeper.
It       is an attempt to assault and astonish the heart, to get at the
deepest disorders and springs of our psychological being, in       order to
affect a change in the very way we feel about ourselves-and
consequently about everything else. Going to the theatre can       be a
dangerous act.  One risks discovering things one doesn't       want to know
about oneself in a way that makes it impossible       to remain the person
one ways before a play eradicated one's       defenses and shattered one's
identity.

(Excuse the gaps - I can't get up the energy to pluck them all out.) The
whole thing is worth reading.

if you're still following, more to the mix:

NYtimes National, March 1, 2006

Online Colleges Receive a Boost =46rom Congress

By SAM DILLON
It took just a few paragraphs in a budget bill for Congress to open a=20
new frontier in education: Colleges will no longer be required to=20
deliver at least half their courses on a campus instead of online to=20
qualify for federal student aid.

That change is expected to be of enormous value to the commercial=20
education industry. Although both for-profit colleges and traditional=20
ones have expanded their Internet and online offerings in recent years,=20=

only a few dozen universities are fully Internet-based, and most of=20
them are for-profit ones.

The provision is just one sign of how an industry that once had a=20
dubious reputation has gained new influence, with well-connected=20
friends in the government and many Congressional Republicans=20
sympathetic to their entrepreneurial ethic.

The Bush administration supported lifting the restriction on online=20
education as a way to reach nontraditional students. Nonprofit=20
universities and colleges opposed such a broad change, with some=20
academics saying there was no proof that online education was=20
effective. But for-profit colleges sought the rollback avidly.

"The power of the for-profits has grown tremendously," said=20
Representative Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware, a member of=20
the House Education and Workforce Committee who has expressed concerns=20=

about continuing reports of fraud. "They have a full-blown lobbying=20
effort and give lots of money to campaigns. In 10 years, the power of=20
this interest group has spiked as much as any you'll find."

Sally L. Stroup, the assistant secretary of education who is the top=20
regulator overseeing higher education, is a former lobbyist for the=20
University of Phoenix, the nation's largest for-profit college, with=20
some 300,000 students.

Two of the industry's closest allies in Congress are Representative=20
John A. Boehner of Ohio, who just became House majority leader, and=20
Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, who is=20
replacing Mr. Boehner as chairman of the House education committee.

And the industry has hired well-connected lobbyists like A. Bradford=20
Card, the brother of the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr.

The elimination of the restriction on online education, included in a=20
$39.5 billion budget-cutting package, is a case study in the new=20
climate. Known as the 50 percent rule, the restriction was one of=20
several enacted by Congress in 1992 after investigations showed that=20
some for-profit trade schools were little more than diploma mills=20
intended to harvest federal student loans.

Since then, the industry has grown enormously, with enrollment at such=20=

colleges outpacing that at traditional ones. In 2003, the last year for=20=

which statistics were available, 703,000 of the 16.9 million students=20
at all degree-granting institutions were attending for-profit colleges.

These colleges offer a wide range of courses, including marketing,=20
accounting, cooking and carpentry. Many attract students who have had=20
limited success at other schools. Some offer certificates, while others=20=

issue associates, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. About=20
2,500 for-profit schools are accredited to offer federal student aid.

Yet commercial higher education continues to have a checkered record,=20
particularly for aggressive recruitment and marketing. The Department=20
of Education's inspector general, John P. Higgins Jr., testified in May=20=

that 74 percent of his fraud cases involved for-profit schools.

But commercial colleges found a sympathetic ear in the administration=20
and Congress in their quest to remove the 50 percent rule.=20
Representatives Boehner and McKeon sponsored the measure.

Laura Palmer Noone, president of the University of Phoenix, said the=20
growth of Internet-based learning had shown it to be effective,=20
especially for rural, military and working students.

Kevin Smith, a spokesman, said Mr. Boehner "views this as removing an=20
unnecessary barrier to distance education." He added, "While continuing=20=

to ensure that there are strong antifraud protections in place, he=20
believes we need to break down more barriers to education for=20
low-income, first-generation and nontraditional students."

Some academics say the nation is rushing to expand online higher=20
education because it is profitable, without serious studies of=20
effectiveness.

"This is a growth industry and you get rich not by being skeptical, but=20=

by being enthusiastic," said Henry M. Levin, director of Columbia=20
University's National Center for the Study of Privatization in=20
Education.

"People at the academic conferences will say they did a survey about=20
Internet-based education, but there are a lot of phantom statistics,"=20
he said, "and its all very promotional. We have not found a single=20
rigorous study comparing online with conventional forms of=20
instruction."

How fast the college landscape will change is uncertain. Sean=20
Gallagher, a senior analyst at Eduventures, a Boston research firm,=20
predicted that the proportion of students taking all their classes=20
online could rise over the next 10 years or so to 25 percent from the=20
current 7 percent.

To test online learning, Congress established a demonstration program=20
in 1998 that allowed a few dozen colleges with online programs to=20
request waivers from the 50 percent rule. The Department of Education=20
reported last year that enrollment at eight of the colleges shot up 700=20=

percent over six years.

Ms. Stroup has overseen the program since becoming an assistant=20
secretary of education in 2002.

Several opponents of lifting the 50 percent rule said Ms. Stroup had=20
been fair in policy evaluations. But in a 2004 audit, the Education=20
Department's inspector general said a 2003 report she provided to=20
Congress on the program "contained unsupported, incomplete and=20
inaccurate statements."

Most were assertions that online education was working as well or=20
better than traditional methods, with little risk. The inspector=20
general, citing the collapse of one participant in the program, the=20
Masters Institute in California, chided the Education Department for=20
reporting that it had found "no evidence" that the rule change could=20
pose hazards.

Ms. Stroup formally disagreed with the inspector general. In an=20
interview, she said a subordinate had written the report, although she=20=

had signed off on it. In a later report to Congress, the department=20
acknowledged "several possible risk factors."

Ms. Stroup, in the interview, said she had withdrawn from all decisions=20=

directly affecting the University of Phoenix. "I don't see myself as=20
representing any one sector," she said. "We try to help all students."

Traditional colleges, in fighting repeal of the rule, cited the Masters=20=

Institute, whose online enrollment surged after it gained access to=20
federal money. The institute collapsed in 2001 during a fraud=20
investigation.

"What we opposed was that federal aid should go to these virtual=20
universities that disguise themselves as colleges, where it's just=20
something on the Internet with no resources behind it," said Sarah=20
Flanagan, a vice president at the National Association of Independent=20
Colleges and Universities, which represents nearly 1,000 nonprofit=20
institutions.

The Department of Education estimated the change would cost the=20
government $697 million over 10 years.

Representatives Boehner and McKeon have also pushed through committee=20
other changes sought by the for-profit industry, and lobbyists and=20
lawmakers gave them good chances of passage this year.

Unlike all but a few traditional universities, the for-profits have=20
formed political action committees to channel campaign donations,=20
especially to members of the House and Senate education committees.

While the $1.8 million that executives of the largest chains of=20
proprietary colleges and their political action committees have donated=20=

to federal candidates since 2000 is not huge by Washington standards,=20
the money is strategically donated.

About a fifth =97 $313,000 =97 went to Mr. Boehner and McKeon and =
political=20
action committees they control, according to figures provided by the=20
Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors campaign finances.

Mr. Smith said there was "zero" connection between the donations and=20
Mr. Boehner's policy decisions. James Geoffrey, a spokesman for Mr.=20
McKeon, said the donations had no bearing on his choices, either.

Some lobbyists for the traditional universities said that because few=20
of them form political action committees, they are at a disadvantage.

"If I seek an appointment with a member of Congress, I get a staff=20
member, if anybody," said David Hawkins, a lobbyist for the National=20
Association of College Admissions Counsellors, which as a nonprofit=20
group is barred from making campaign donations.

A. Bradford Card, who represents some commercial colleges in New York,=20=

said lawmakers were responding to commercial colleges' educational=20
contributions. He said he had spoken several times with Mr. Boehner=20
about his clients' agenda. Mr. Card said he never lobbied his brother,=20=

Mr. Bush's chief of staff.

"These are not fly-by-night schools," Mr. Card said "Members of=20
Congress are really taking a look at this industry because they=20
recognize that proprietary colleges are helping people get into the=20
work force, pay taxes and become the best they can be."

Mime-Version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v746.2)
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=WINDOWS-1252; delsp=yes; format=flowed

Fine Tooth Press of Connecticut is pleased to announce the release of =20=

Donna
Kuhn's first full-length poetry collection "typical girl." The book =20
is 75pages with a color cover designed by the publisher, JJ Sargeant.

http://www.finetoothpress.com/

Donna Kuhn is the author of several books and chapbooks of poetry. =20
She has published over 400 poems in print and online journals and =20
anthologies including malleable jungle, aught, big bridge,blackbox, =20
generator press, over the transom, unlikely stories, argotist online, =20=

xstream, muse apprentice guild, juxta, 5-trope, moria, your black =20
eye, lost and found times, starfish, ambit, fusebox. Her visual art =20
and visual poetry have been widely exhibited and published and her =20
experimental poetry/dance videos have been shown on cable access =20
channels, online and at art galleries and film festivals. She lives =20
in Santa Cruz, California.

Blurbs:

Birds, moons, words, water, skies: with these basic elements Donna =20
Kuhn creates a voice swirling down a hypnotizing stream of thought, =20
thought addressed to "u", which could well be the "I" of these =20
poems.  Or of this single long poem which seems to wrap a conscious =20
presence in a veil of motion, as if to hide something, but revealing =20
all.  Outside a "geometric beauty salon" she is "shaving inside =20
birds"; a "typical girl" dreaming from the outside in.  A beautiful =20
and mesmerizing book.

John M. Bennett, editor of Lost and Found Times



How many is she? This frenzied poet is all weathers and landscapes =20
and animal joy. With blinding twists and broken tongue, with the =20
fragments of her life, mind and body in constant motion, Kuhn revels =20
(and reveals) in these songs an utterly contemporary ancient theater. =20=

This is alchemy in burlesque Eucharist. =93u cannot hold me down when i =20=

am a dancing mood bird=94. The old stories tell how the (female) =20
monster of Chaos was destroyed by the (male) hero of order. Obviously =20=

someone lied. Kuhn restores to us this blessed chaos. Not incoherence =20=

or obscurity, but that raw, sweet chaos that can realign your neurons =20=

to their natural state. You do not read this poetry so much as it =20
happens to you. Rave on! Typical girl? Oh yes, in a poet=92s paradise. =20=

Forget the infotainment and intelligentsia. This is the real world =20
made music.

Jake Berry, author of Brambu Drezi and Species of Abandoned Light



 =46rom the book:

SHAVING CHINA'S HEART

your charcoal wife, i have hid the sea

u have hid birds, words

the rain u nagasaki down birds

i have hid the rain with its eyelid

under his deadly awning like shaving chinas heart

go paint a radiation receptionist

wolves reach my radioactive eggs

home with an executive gator

snow inside my branch

i get these blocks with anyones war horses

leave the moon divorced

four to five blocks, lady

the girls dont care no stars feel an exit

a man says go feel a cartoon

feel a cartoon father exit

i ask how she opens hands

Please visit her blog to see her other books and chapbooks, reviews, =20
interviews,poetry and art.

Please see her mac homepage for more information,art, slideshows, =20
video and audio poetry and links to other sites.

Just thought maybe some of you might be interested
in my two recent blogs in which I pretty much go through the
current St. Marks Poetry Proj. Newsletter cover to cover.
Part one, is more loose and informal, to some extent in the spirit of
much of that issue...

Part 2 largely focuses on the Dale Smith piece (which I think is a really
important piece of writing)---and I'm going to try to shape my response
into something slightly more formal and hopefully publishable--.
(if anybody's interested, feel free to backchannel)--

I also talk a little about Lorber's interview with Chomsky
and Joel Lewis's review of Ted Berrigan collected

Honestly M. Nudel. Spare us your misogynist fantasies. They're at once
boring, cliched and offensive.

Frankly, as theatre goes, documentary theatre isn't my cup of tea.  Whatever
the issues concerned, or the aesthetic value of the piece (well, Michael
Billington liked it) the pulling of a programmed play at the last moment by
a theatre company (which sells itself on doing provocative theatre), because
it "polled" community leaders and found to its surprise that it was
controversial, is bullshit.

Published: March 7, 2006

Just a week after a potential production of the=20
controversial British play "My Name Is Rachel=20
Corrie" was delayed at the New York Theater=20
Workshop because of political concerns, the Royal=20
Court Theater in London said it was considering=20
several other offers to take the play to New York.

Ewan Thomson, a spokesman for the Royal Court,=20
confirmed that officials there wanted to stage it=20
in New York "as soon as we possibly can" and have=20
talked to other producers. Mr. Thomson said the=20
company was hoping to capitalize on the show's=20
momentum from a coming run in London's West End,=20
where it will play from March 28 to May 7,=20
approximately the same dates it had been=20
tentatively scheduled to run at New York Theater Workshop.

And in a sign of heightened tensions between the=20
two theaters, the Royal Court also issued a=20
statement to address "factual inaccuracies" in a=20
letter posted on the workshop's Web site and=20
assertions made by James C. Nicola, the workshop's artistic director.

In particular, the Royal Court's statement took=20
issue with the workshop's assertion that the=20
planned production of "Rachel Corrie" was not=20
definite, saying that press releases had been=20
finalized, previews set, budgets approved,=20
flights booked and tickets listed for sale. "I=20
don't want this to become a spat between two=20
theaters," said Mr. Thomson, who faxed a copy of=20
the statement to The New York Times. "But there=20
were certain factual inaccuracies we wanted to address."

Mr. Nicola was traveling yesterday and=20
unavailable for comment, but Lynn Moffat, the=20
workshop's managing director, disputed the Royal=20
Court's statement, saying that many production=20
details and creative elements were still being=20
settled when the show was delayed.

"Everything was in the soup," Ms. Moffat said.=20
"But we were going on good faith. We were moving forward."

Mr. Nicola said last week that he had decided to=20
postpone the show after polling local Jewish=20
leaders as to their feelings about the play,=20
which follows the story of Rachel Corrie, an=20
idealistic American demonstrator who was crushed=20
to death by an Israeli bulldozer in March 2003=20
while trying to prevent the destruction of a home in the Gaza Strip.

Written by=20
<http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=3D60157&inline=
=3Dnyt-per>Alan=20
Rickman, the actor, and Katherine Viner, a=20
journalist with The Guardian newspaper in London,=20
and pieced together from Ms. Corrie's own=20
journals and e-mail messages, the show was a hit=20
in London and garnered strong reviews. But Mr.=20
Nicola said recent conversations with Jewish=20
leaders had uncovered an unease about the play's=20
message at a time when=20
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/h/hamas/i=
ndex.html?inline=3Dnyt-org>Hamas,=20
the militant Palestinian group, had scored a victory in recent elections.

The workshop later posted a statement on its Web=20
site elaborating on the decision, saying it had=20
not canceled or censored the production and that=20
time pressures =AD particularly "Alan Rickman's=20
pre-existing film commitments" =AD had driven it to delay the show.

"We asked a rather routine question, or so we=20
thought, to our London colleagues about altering=20
the time frame," the workshop's statement read.=20
"Our intent in asking for the postponement was to=20
allow us enough time to contextualize the work so=20
Rachel Corrie's powerful voice could best be=20
heard above the din of others shouting for their own purposes."

But the announcement of the play's delay caused=20
some concern in artistic circles on both sides of=20
the Atlantic. In a letter posted on the political=20
Web site Counterpunch.org, for example, the=20
actress=20
<http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=3D59206&inline=
=3Dnyt-per>Vanessa=20
Redgrave, a longtime supporter of the Palestinian=20
cause, called the workshop's decision "censorship=20
of the worst kind" and the "blacklisting of a dead girl and her diaries."

In New York, the playwright Christopher Shinn =AD a=20
member of the workshop's extended artistic=20
ensemble, the Usual Suspects =AD also published a=20
short essay online calling for more playwrights=20
to come forward to protest the workshop's=20
decision. "If I were a young playwright, I would=20
get the message loud and clear: don't write=20
political plays if you want to get them=20
produced," Mr. Shinn wrote. "And if you write a=20
play that gets scheduled, and then pulled for=20
political reasons, don't expect the theater=20
community to come out and support your freedom of=20
expression. This is a ghastly message to send."

Ms. Moffat said that she and Mr. Nicola were=20
surprised by the reaction, in particular an op-ed=20
piece by Ms. Viner in The Los Angeles Times that=20
accused Mr. Nicola of "exercising prior censorship."

"The charge of censorship is what's really=20
distressing to us," Ms. Moffat said. "We didn't=20
take the word postponement to mean censorship."

Ms. Moffat added that the workshop still intended=20
to present "Rachel Corrie" next season. But the=20
Royal Court's statement yesterday made that seem less likely.

"A postponement at any time, but especially at=20
this late stage, is not the action of an=20
organization committed to producing 'My Name Is=20
Rachel Corrie,' " the statement read, adding that=20
there was no assurance that the political climate=20
in the Middle East would change anytime soon.

Poor Mr. Nudel, indeed -- he's just yearning to blow up some houses
and drive tractors over young women daring to obstruct such righteous
demolitions.  Maybe he's also fantasizing about being in the Deep
South during the 1950s, firehose in hand (the waterpower back then was
sufficient to strip the clothes off of young women demonstrators...but
I don't want to stimulate Mr. Nudel's already overheated imagination
any further).

Incidentally, has anyone else noticed that in his postings, Mr. Nudel
shows an inordinate fondness for the ellipsis?  Kind of like Louis-
Ferdinand Celine without the talent.

Ivor Cutler

Unassuming master of offbeat humour whose eccentric take on the world =20=

entertained generations

http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1725211,00.html

Mark Espiner
Tuesday March 7, 2006
The Guardian

Ivor Cutler, the eccentric poet, singer, songwriter and storyteller, =20
who has died aged 83, appealed to successive generations with his =20
offbeat sense of humour and wonder at the world. In more than four =20
decades of performing he attracted a band of admirers and followers =20
that included such luminaries as philosopher Bertrand Russell, =20
Beatles John and Paul, DJ John Peel and comedian Billy Connolly. Pop =20
mavericks such as Oasis discoverer Alan McGee and Franz Ferdinand's =20
Alex Kapranos were also fans. The scope of his appeal was reflected =20
in his dedicated following on BBC Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4 - and many =20
stations beyond.

Cutler's Jewish parents and grandparents came to the UK at the end of =20=

the 19th century in the wake of pogroms in eastern Europe. Thinking =20
they were bound for the US, but finding their ship docked at Glasgow, =20=

they stayed there. Ivor was born 100 yards from the Rangers ground at =20=

Ibrox Park - he perpetuated the myth that his first scream was =20
synchronous with a goal.

His childhood, shared with two brothers and two sisters, should have =20
been happy, but a combination of anti-semitic schoolteachers and the =20
belief that he became a lesser being in his mother's eyes after his =20
younger brother was born seemed to inhibit his development. At the =20
age of three, he tried to kill his younger sibling with a poker, only =20=

to be stopped by an intervening aunt. But songs around the piano in =20
three-part harmonies, and the formative moment when, aged six, he won =20=

the school prize for his rendition of Robert Burns' My Love is like a =20=

Red Red Rose, give a somewhat warmer picture of his upbringing.

Nevertheless, the exaggerated view of a dour Scots childhood, no =20
doubt informed by seeing his peers arriving at school with bare feet =20
- a fact which, he later claimed, helped form his leftwing political =20
views, aged five - appeared in his hilarious writings, Life in a =20
Scotch Sitting Room Volume 2. With lines such as "Voiding bowels in =20
those days was unheard of. People just kept it in," he used a string =20
of fantastical untruths to expose the reality of his life and the =20
Spartan - and sometimes sadistic - Scottish existence.

In 1939 Cutler was evacuated to Annan. Following some failed attempts =20=

by his travelling salesman father to include him in the business, he =20
took a job as an apprentice fitter at Rolls-Royce. In 1941, =20
determined to prove wrong those who claimed that Jews were not =20
pulling their weight by enlisting, he signed up for the RAF. He =20
trained as a navigator, but was dismissed for being too dreamy and =20
absent-minded, apparently more interested in looking at the clouds =20
from the cockpit window than locating a flight path. He served out =20
the rest of the war as a first aid and storeman with the Winsor =20
Engineering Company, then studied at Glasgow School of Art and became =20=

a schoolteacher.

Working at a school in Paisley, however, did not agree with Cutler. =20
He hated discipline that required the strap, having received it more =20
than 200 times himself, and in a dramatic gesture took the instrument =20=

from his desk, cut it into pieces and dispensed them to the class. =20
Leaving Scotland was, he claimed, "the beginning of my life".

That new life included teaching at AS Neill's Summerhill school. =20
Dubbed a hippy academy where a different approach to education was =20
fostered, Summerhill was run with rules agreed between staff and =20
pupils, and the premise was to educate the whole person. This =20
alternative philosophy appealed to Cutler. He lived in the grounds of =20=

the school and engaged the pupils with drama and music. He also =20
married and had two children, although the marriage did not last, and =20=

elements of his eccentric behaviour surfaced in his parenting, such =20
as his insistence on sending his son to his first day at school in a =20
kilt.

Cutler continued to teach until 1980 for the Inner London Education =20
Authority - to the chagrin of some parents, who found his unorthodox =20
methods subversive (such as having his pupils improvise, during a =20
drama class, killing their siblings). But he also had a showbiz =20
career, and claimed it was teaching that unlocked his creativity. He =20
began with a gig at the Blue Angel, in London in 1957, which he =20
always referred to as an unmitigated failure, and he did not begin =20
writing poetry until he was 42 - maintaining he was not any good =20
until he was 48.

Cutler hawked his songs around Tin Pan Alley and was eventually =20
recognised by a promoter who recorded his work and introduced him to =20
the comedy producer Ned Sherrin. Sherrin was tickled by Cutler's =20
surrealist folk music and booked him to appear on television; he =20
subsequently performed on the Acker Bilk Show and Late Night Line-Up. =20=

On one such appearance he was spotted by Paul McCartney, who invited =20
Cutler to appear in the Beatles' film Magical Mystery Tour (1967). =20
Cutler duly found himself playing Buster Bloodvessel, the bus =20
conductor who announces to his passengers, "I am concerned for you to =20=

enjoy yourselves within the limits of British decency" and then =20
develops a passion for Ringo's large aunt Jessie.

In another Beatles connection, his 1967 record, Ludo, was produced by =20=

George Martin, who was not amused by Cutler's eccentricities during =20
the Abbey Road recording sessions. Maintaining its appeal to a new =20
generation, the record was re-released on Oasis's label, Creation, in =20=

1998. Cutler's distinctive baritone, coupled with the wheeze of the =20
harmonium, became the trademark of his songwriting style as much as =20
his offbeat, imaginative and observant lyrics.

For the latter part of his career, Cutler lived on his own in a flat =20
on Parliament Hill Fields, north London, which he found by placing an =20=

ad in the New Statesman saying "Ivor Cutler seeks room near Heath. =20
Cheap!". There he would receive visitors, and his companion Phyllis =20
King, in a reception room filled with clutter, pictures and curios, =20
including his harmonium, some ivory cutlery (a pun, of course) and a =20
wax ear stapled to the wall with six-inch nails - proof of his =20
dedication to the Noise Abatement Society, because of which he =20
forbade his audience ever to whistle in appreciation at his work. The =20=

bicycle was his preferred mode of transport, its cow-horn handlebars =20
in the sit-up-and-beg position in line with his Alexander technique =20
practice.

Besides his accomplishments in songwriting and poetry (he was =20
included in Faber's collection of Scottish verse, edited by Douglas =20
Dunn), Cutler also engaged in quasi-performance art. He was wont to =20
carry chalk to draw circle faces around dog excrement on the =20
pavement, and would hand out gold sticky labels inscribed with such =20
legends as "Made of dust", "True happiness is knowing you're a =20
hypocrite" and "Changing your pants is like taking a clean plate".

Although he often took a stern demeanour with strangers, and insisted =20=

on them addressing him as Mr Cutler, it was in many ways a front. In =20
less public company, his face would readily break into a grin, and =20
sometimes he would remove his fez or hat to reveal a bald pate, about =20=

which he once remarked: "Sur le volcan ne pousse pas l'herbe" (Grass =20
does not grow on a volcano).

Such bon mots were indications of his love of languages. He could =20
quote from Homer, taught himself Chinese and was in the habit of =20
frequenting Soho's Chinatown, where he could display his knowledge - =20
although, typically, he chose Chinese above Japanese because the =20
textbooks were cheaper. With the onset of old age he was increasingly =20=

worried about losing his memory, given that his father and brother =20
had both developed Alzheimer's disease. It was a fear that was to be =20
tragically fulfilled. He retired from the stage at the age of 82.

Cutler seemed to live by the epigrams he wrote, particularly =20
"Imperfection is an end; perfection is only an aim," as well as his =20
belief that art was therapy. As a creator of work that was bizarre, =20
unique, sinister, bleak, funny, touching - and sometimes achingly =20
moving - it proved to be therapeutic as much for his fans as for its =20
creator. He is survived by his sons.

This play and EVERYTHING associated with it, including the pox of  comments
here, is just another absurd scene. The disease is part of the  human
condition. The hubris of artists is their quackery. As if. Can a poem or a  play stop
the insanity? Changing a few hearts and minds has never made a  difference,
except to those hearts and minds. That's progress,  an impossibly slow,
improbability.

Then again, we must think of the children and their future. Keep  rollin',

ACTION ALERT: Arsenal supporting Israeli Apartheid


Background


IHRC calls upon all campaigners to contact Arsenal FC to protest against
their decision to sign a sponsorship deal to promote Israel as a tourist
destination. The campaign is supported by the Palestinian Return Centre,
Innovative Minds, Friends of al Aqsa, the British Muslim Initiative, the
Muslim Association of Britain, the Palestinian Forum in Britain,
Scottish-Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

Arsenal Football Club has just signed a sponsorship deal to promote
Israel as a tourist destination from next season. The £350,000 agreement
makes Israel Arsenal's "official and exclusive travel destination."
Below are just some of the benefits Israel will receive from this deal:

- Israel will be featured on digital perimeter boards and 450
high-definition LCD screens at the stadium on game days;
- Israel will feature on the team's website, Arsenal.com; and in its
magazine.
- The televised ads will reach audiences in an estimated 198 countries.
- The Israeli Tourism Ministry will receive intellectual property
rights, the use of the team logo and the right to use photos of the team
and its players in ads.
- The Israeli Tourism Minister will be allowed use the stadium
banqueting hall twice a year and organize an exhibition at the end of
the playing season
- The stadium will hold permanent sale tables for Israel t-shirts

The financial advisers Ernst & Young were employed to draft this
proposal with the aim of bringing an extra 2 million tourists to Israel
annually.

Israel is a racist apartheid state built upon the ethnic cleansing of
the indigenous Arab population from Palestine. Anti-apartheid
campaigners such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu have stated as much and
called for a complete boycott of Israel similar to that used against
apartheid South Africa.

Israel’s apartheid policies include the segregation of West Bank roads
by the military and the construction of a vast steel and concrete
barrier through the West Bank and Jerusalem. Dubbed the "apartheid wall"
by human rights activists, because it forces communities apart and grabs
land, it was held to be in violation of international law by the
International Court of Justice. Israel’s plan to carve up the West Bank,
apportioning pieces of territory to the Palestinians is also comparable
with South Africa's "bantustans" - the nominally independent homelands
into which millions of black men and women were herded.

Israel's racial discrimination is daily life of most Palestinian Arabs
who have no place in a "Jewish" state. Since Israel is a Jewish state,
Israeli Jews are given special rights which non-Jews do not have. Israel
has deprived millions of Palestinians of their liberty and property and
has waged a war against a civilian population, in particular children.

As regards football, Israeli human rights groups have documented how
Israeli soldiers routinely shoot Palestinian children playing football
outside their refugee camps. Furthermore, Israeli authorities regularly
prevent Palestinian players from attending international games. In
September 2004, five players were prevented from traveling to the World
Cup qualifier against Uzbekistan. Unable to play in Palestine, the team
travels to Doha, Qatar, for "home" games and trains in Ismailia, Egypt,
more than 100 miles from the local Gaza players' homes.

For a full detailed analysis of the apartheid in Israel and its
parallels with apartheid South Africa, please read Chris McGreal’s
excellent 2-part report in the Guardian at the links below:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1703245,00.html
http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1704037,00.html

For Arsenal to sign a deal to promote such a state is to go against the
very principles of ‘Kicking Racism out of Football’. Amazingly,
Arsenal’s Managing Director who signed the deal, Keith Edelman stated
after the deal was signed, “We are in the forefront of the anti-racism
campaign in England”. This deal will no doubt put this reputation into
serious question.

Dear Mr Edelman

RE: Sponsorship deal with Israel

I am writing to express my deep concern about Arsenal FC’s recent
sponsorship deal to promote Israel as a tourist destination. Arsenal FC
has hitherto enjoyed an excellent reputation for fighting racism and
this deal will seriously put this reputation at risk.

Israel is a racist apartheid state built upon the ethnic cleansing of
the indigenous Arab population from Palestine. Anti-apartheid
campaigners such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu have stated as much and
called for a complete boycott of Israel similar to that used against
apartheid South Africa.

Israel’s apartheid policies include the segregation of West Bank roads
by the military and the construction of a vast steel and concrete
barrier through the West Bank and Jerusalem. Dubbed the "apartheid
wall", because it forces communities apart and grabs land, it was held
to be in violation of international law by the International Court of
Justice. Israel’s plan to carve up the West Bank, apportioning pieces of
territory to the Palestinians is also comparable with South Africa's
"bantustans" - the nominally independent homelands into which millions
of black men and women were herded.

Israel's racial discrimination is daily life of most Palestinian Arabs
who have no place in a "Jewish" state. Since Israel is a Jewish state,
Israeli Jews are given special rights which non-Jews do not have. Israel
has deprived millions of Palestinians of their liberty and property and
has waged a war against a civilian population, in particular children.

As regards football, Israeli human rights groups have documented how
Israeli soldiers routinely shoot Palestinian children playing football
outside their refugee camps. Furthermore, Israeli authorities regularly
prevent Palestinian players from attending international games. In
September 2004, five players were prevented from traveling to the World
Cup qualifier against Uzbekistan. Unable to play in Palestine, the team
travels to Doha, Qatar, for "home" games and trains in Ismailia, Egypt,
more than 100 miles from the local Gaza players' homes.

For Arsenal to sign a deal to promote such apartheid state as Israel is
to go against the very principles of the ‘Let’s Kick Racism out of
Football’ campaign. I urge you to pull out of this deal as only economic
pressure, similar to that which toppled the apartheid South African
regime, will end apartheid in Israel.

I look forward to hearing from you soon on this urgent matter.

Yours Sincerely,

FYI - The Bancroft Library has acquired Lamantia's archives - in addition to
unpublished works, there is a substantial, and apparently great cache of
correspondence from the forties to the present.
I do not know if the processing has begun, but I assume the correspondence
will offer a genuinely fresh view of 'the life and times' of American
surrealism and its diverse writing and art influences and writer
associations in New York, Mexico, Morocco, with the Beats, as well as many
other significant figures.
Suggest emailing Anthony Bliss, Curator of Rare Books at the Bancroft for
status of things. In addition to Philip Whalen - which is processed - the
Library is processing the large recent cache Spicer manuscripts,
correspondence and such, and the papers of David Meltzer and Michael
McClure.

Peter: An (A)Historical Romance, the long-awaited
third novel by Jeffrey DeShell

An orphaned child of privilege, Peter enjoys a snug
L.A. existence full of thing -- to eat, to wear, and
to play with. But his world is rocked when he meets a
yound Palestinian woman, Reham, who claims to be
Peter's half-sister. DeShell's excessive, digressive
opera of objects follows these two to Istanbul,
Jerusalem, and Gaza City, teetering on the razor's
edge between obsession and rejection, fascination and
disgust. "Jeffrey DeShell's high-octane rewrite of
Melville's classic Pierre sweeps the reader from 'the
'tightish pale cotton tees (Marc Ribot $45)' of L.A.
to the 'complex bouquet of dust, worked lamb,
rosemary, human sweat, oranges, jasmine, cooking lamb
and charcoal' of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul to the
'chronic ambience of damage assimilated and endured
(enduring)' of Gaza. By turns hilarious and harrowing,
Peter is pure dynamite." - Laird Hunt, author of The
Impossibly.  400 pages, $18.  ISBN 0-9703165-2-6.

Has anybody in New York been down to see the new Holzer/Poetry project
projected within &/or outside the first skyscraper to emerge at 'Ground
Zero' as reported in yesterday's NY Times (which also reports on the
dynamics of the collaboration between the builder and the artist)?
 8 hours of poetry/text, apparently not all American.

As 'Public Art' it's nice to see that Poetry is in Advance of the Figurative
Arts (sculpture/painting) in taking part in the 'resurrective' architectural
lead here.

But appreciate a 'poet(s) eye-witness' view of the work.

 (Maybe Holzer will also provide audio i-pod or podcast to go along with the
visual, too??)

Curious,

Stephen Vincent

My folks' folks are from Glasgow.  It was not that my Irish-Mexican friend
(one of two -- the other no fatalist) tried to kill her sibling(s), it was that,
at ten, she tried to kill another ten-year-old girl while she stood at a
railing admiring the Minnehaha Falls.  They stopped her, the mothers, who were
probably friends.  The girl didn't die over the pretty waterfall, thus
disappointing my friend, a story she told suddenly about Minneapolis, when I told her I
was from MN.

Langston Hughes said that the writer certainly has a special duty to =
society because words are powerful: =93The written word is a force and to =
misuse that power * to use it for false and lying purposes, would seem to =
me morally wrong.=94  I agree with Langston Hughes (please forgive my =
paraphrase if it is not complete).

Dorothy Parker said, in a broadcast from Madrid in 1937:

=93I heard someone say, and so I said it too, that ridicule is the most =
effective weapon. I don't suppose I ever really believed it, but it was =
easy and comforting, and so I said it. Well, now I know that there are =
things that have never really been funny, and never will be. And I know =
that ridicule may be a shield, but it is not a weapon.=94

Paul Rusesabagina said, in an interview with Oprah, that the only thing =
that saved the 1,268 people he sheltered in the Hotel Milles Collines was =
words.
What rhetoric.  He also said: =93An ordinary man is one who does his job.  =
That=92s what I did.  As a hotel manager, I simply catered to a different =
clientele.=94

It is convenient to render the position of the artist, writer, educated =
person absurd, as Mary Jo Malo (and Stanley Fish) has done.  Not cleverly =
but clumsily, possibly absurdly to some, I will say that I find what Harry =
Nudel said disrespectful of Rachel Corrie, living or dead, disrespectful =
of readers here, and shameful.

Hello:

I have not received The Poetics List in several weeks. Is it just me?
I've written to the "poetics list administration" but he/she/they must
be busy with other things.
=20
Living in the developing world, sometimes we have internet problems. Was
a list digest returned as "undeliverable" so my membership discontinued?

(I wish I could find that email that told me where to write if I had any
problems. Sorry for using multiple addresses.)

Thanks,

Right, the ROTC thing the latest but certainly not the last...

Richard Ohmann, "Accountability and the Conditions for Curricular=20
Change"

is chapter 5 in

_Beyond English Inc._ (Ed. David Downing, Claude Mark Hurlbert, and=20
Paula Mathieu), Boynton/Cook, 2002.

David Downing, whom Joel currently works with at IUP, edits _Works and=20=

Days_, which will be doing a special issue on Ohmann this year, I=20
think.

Worth checking out (I haven't yet, but who can resist given the title):

Ohmann, _Politics of Knowledge: The Commercialization of the=20
University, the Professions, and Print Culture_ (Wesleyan 2003).

Thanks for asking, Kerri.

Mairead,

I read Nudel's remarks as inflammatory.

However, I don't believe the Absurdist point of view to be any less valid
than an optimistic perspective. The absurd approach to life is neither
convenient, clever, nor easily arrived at. I don't know much about Fish except  his
text & reader theory which is interesting. The Absurd, as demonstrated  in the
works of Ionesco, Beckett, Camus and Sartre and the  "deconstructionists" are
more relevant for my argument. Other than preservation  of the planet and
species, what is absolute? Some can even argue that saving  this madness is itself
insane. Of course that can put one in the religious  fundamentalist or
anarchist camps where "heaven" or post-apocalyptic  campfires await. However, I don't
begrudge anyone their personally  devised utopias. It's just the futility of
proselytizing for such that  annoys me.

Those of us who walk the line between hope and absurdity know there are few
success stories. I'm sorry if I bristle, but examination of world history and
my  own personal life leaves me sad and helpless against such cyclical and
overwhelmingly tragic situations. When you begin to contemplate all sides of
each argument, the ambiguities are paralyzing.

That individual lives are improving qualitatively because of art,  can be
argued. That the human condition or the world has changed quantitatively  can
not. When I mentioned Bianco Luno's controversial statement a few days ago,  I
was picking a philosophical fight over the which scraps of human endeavor make
any real difference.

Artists and other kinds of people find it hard to admit that their lives  may
be futile, so they find meaning and purpose through their work or  obsession.
But their choices are only that, personal choices, based  fundamentally upon
their genetic and cultural situation. An  individual might rise above their
situation; and yes, often because of  art or a special person(s) investment of
time and money.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try. In my camp, not expecting too much has
never disappointed me. And if I cry too much about it all, I often end up
laughing at the absurdity. That is, until I start crying again. Advocating  absurdity
doesn't make the world more absurd. In fact, advocating most anything  is in
itself absurd. I doubt that anyone loves this place the same way I  do.

Mary Jo

I thought I'd mention three readings I'm doing on the West Coast.

I'm reading with Eileen Myles and Jerome Rothenberg on March 18th at 8:30 in
San Diego. This reading is at Shambhala at 4060 Adams Ave. - across from the
Ken Cinema.

On March 26th I'm reading at Open Books in Seattle at 3:30. The address is
2414 N. 45th St.

On March 28th I'm reading at Sonoma State with Catherine Wagner at 5:00.

Thanks,

I know nothing about the merits of this play.

I do know that an American citizen was brutally killed by occupation forces and
that the US government, more concerned with invading Iraq at the time, did
nothing about it.

ISU at Normal is historically a teaching college or "Normal School" =
while
the University of Illinois is the original state university; the =
difference
in institutional history or tradition affects the mission and the focus =
of
the school; the same division is true of the (more recent that Illinois) =
UC
system versus the CSU system, for example, and is a pretty common setup =
for
state universities.=20

These, too, are public schools.  One would expect that the policies and
procedures for a public university or college to be different from those =
at
a private university or college, a religious / private institution, from =
an
institution that is part of a system versus one which is not, etc.  =
I.e.,
going to one of the Loyolas, or Marquette or Fordham is different from =
going
to Georgetown, even though they are all run by the same religious order.

*

The pending Arizona law was discussed on another list I'm on; it results
from the assignment in a cc classroom of The Ice Storm book and movie =
and
apparently the screening of the key swapping scene by the State Senate
Committee on Higher Education.  I can't imagine, though, that I would =
have
ever taught the ice storm in a cc classroom; it is not easy to justify =
and
it is not necessary for the teaching reading, writing, and reasoning, =
which
is all lower division literature is. I wish we could let the battle be =
about
the possibility of writing a paper, a poem, or a story about something =
other
than fundamentalist religious dogma or "witnessing."  Let it be possible =
to
challenge students academically first, especially the idiotic ones.

All best,

not sure what a "cc" classroom is -- Communty College?

and am no fan of THE ICE STORM -- but I can't for the life of me see why it
would be any less suitable for a lower division lit &/or writing course than
any of the things I was routinely asked to teach in such classes over the years
-- equally unsure how "necessary" even gets into the discussion -- Is any one
text in a comp class any  more or less necessary than an alternative?

Would these same people object to the teaching of Hawthorne's YOUNG GOODMAN
BROWN (which I taught for years from an assigned textbook in lower division
classes), a tale which, after all, portrays something very much like the key
swapping scene (some say even the governor's wife was there!!!)

i've taught at just about every kind of institution except a community college
-- I've taught in elementary schools -- public & private universities -- large
and small -- Catholic and secular -- I have had students express reservations
about some of our texts -- and we had classroom discussions about it -- This
really got a San Jose State class that had been pretty quiet all through
GRAVITY'S RAINBOW going when one student objected to vulgarity -- OK, that was
an upper division class -- Have to say I've never encountered any objections to
any text in any lower division class -- just lucky, I guess --

I don't know if she wants her "real" e-mail to be passed in the clear on
other lists, but the spammy e-mail from her site is

modpoet@excite.com

=20

If you want to front channel info about independent bookstores that have
poetry selections and reading series, pls. front channel.

=20

P.S.  Since this is my second post:  I think it is necessary to think
"necessary" when students haven't necessarily read any novels before, or
dislike reading so much they need movies to get through novels and short
stories, and may not read novels again unless they find something they =
love.

=20

=20

=20

I'm contacting independent bookstores across the US to display a series =
of
broadsides on the theme of peace (the goal is to have the series in one
venue in each of the fifty states).  So far, the response has been
wonderful, however, there are a few states in which I need some
recommendations on who to contact. =20

=20

So, if you know of a good poetry-friendly independent bookstore in any =
of
these states that might be interested in displaying the poems, if you =
could
backchannel me with a bookstore name, city/state, I'd be quite =
appreciative.


Here are the states in which I still need to find a poetry-friendly
bookstore:

=20

Alabama

Arkansas

Connecticut

Hawaii

Kansas=20

Louisiana

Maryland

Mississippi

Nevada

North Dakota

Ohio

Oklahoma

Rhode Island

Utah

Vermont

West Virginia

Wyoming

=20

Also, I may have some extra broadsides available, so if there is a =
terrific
poetry-friendly bookstore in a state NOT listed above you think may be
interested, please feel free to email me as well.

As always, thanks for your help!

All the best,=20

My maybe not so jaded mind automatically rhymes "ill" w/ nudel." drn!

Can we get off this nut?

Just as our apparently pathologically blind - aye, but very dangerous, Vice
President is teaming up with Rumsfeld et al to renew some version of quail
hunting in Iran!   If the President and Republican Party polls are going to
be turned around - what these war proponents are referring to, I suspect, as
"meaningful consequences" - why not another "slam dunk" military victory,
this time in Iran.

Somehow, sometime soon, it seems - maybe it will be the young again - there
has to be a rage, and long term, organized protests against this madness
into which these odd people continue to lead "us." Otherwise, much of this
collective quiet strikes me as suicidal dormancy.

I know this can be an annoying and naive question, but I mean it.

Mr. Nudel reminded me that the more horrors I read about and the scarier this country and others become in my lifetime, the less I am interested in reading a post-post-postmodernist poem about the state of things and the more interested I am in changing them -- or at least understanding them enough to be educated in an election year ...

So, as annoying as it is, I'm asking all of you who seem to care about poetry as much as I (think) I do (or did): Does it matter? Does it do anything? Does it change anything or anyone? Are other media taking it's place? Is it evolving to the point that it is now something else? Do we have anything to say that will outlast our lifetimes?

I am surrounded by corporate semi-literates most of the day, so I'm putting my watercooler talk here ...

Flora,

Thanks for the question. During my morning routine today, I pulled out a
poem by Sam Hamill entitled:

A Pisan Canto

The real subject of poetry, Tu Fu cries,
          is character,
character built and defined
          by the ordinary words we stand by,
made exemplary by a poet's craft and vision,
          each deed by proper word defined,
who can draw from the air
          a live tradition,
and from many a fine old eye
          that same unconquerable flame -

and late in the poem he says of poetry:

It is a path to enlightenment.

Charles Olson and Robert Duncan (& WCW to some extent before them)
understood the poem as a "field of action." If we do practice poetry,
and we do seek a deeper understanding, a deeper meaning from life than
the pettyness we sometimes see around us, poetry as praxis leads to a
deepening of consciousness and a stronger attractor field which effects
everything to which it is connected, which is everything according to
20th century quantum physics and to ancient Zen wisdom. So if you do
head out on the character-building path of a poetry practice, you can
survive being trapped in a cage in Italy and years in a mental
institution (as in Pound's case) or having the press you created, built
and worked with for 32 years be taken away from you and perhaps even
THRIVE in spite of it.

For more on the connection between the concept of Field poetry and the
organismic concepts of Alfred North Whitehead that was a prime source
for Charles Olson, see my essays at:
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Dualism_and_Olsonian.htm
and http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/The_Sound_of_the_Field_(1.19.06).htm

Keep the faith Flora.

It's highly unlikely that we'll invade Iran, a much more difficult
job than the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. For one, we have
neither allies on-site nor easy internal divisions to exploit there,
for another, the terrain would be hell on tanks, and for a third the
Iranian military hasn't suffered under a regime of sanctions for the
past 20 years. Put another way, the calculation in Iraq and
Afghanistan of a low-cost first stage was accurate--the mistake was
the misunderstanding of the aftermath. In Iran nothing would be
low-cost. And the headlines wouldn't be likely to help the Republicans.

Boog City presents

d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press

Skanky Possum (Austin, Texas)

Tues. March 14, 6 p.m., free

*please note the series is now held
on second Tuesdays

ACA Galleries
529 W.20th St., 5th Flr.
NYC

Event will be hosted by Skanky Possum editors
Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith

Featuring readings from

Basil King
Kristin Prevallet

With music by

I feel tractor

There will be wine, cheese, and fruit, too.

Curated and with an introduction by Boog City editor David Kirschenbaum

-----------

Hoa Nguyen lives in Austin, Texas with Dale Smith and their two children.
Together they edit Skanky Possum, a small poetry journal and book imprint,
and curate a monthly reading series. Her full-length collection of poetry,
Your Ancient See Through, was published in 2002, with line drawings by
Philip Trussell. Effing Press released her latest publication Red Juice in
February 2005.

Dale Smith edits Skanky Possum Press with Hoa Nguyen. His poems, essays, and
reviews have appeared in First Intensity, Effing, New American Writing, the
Chicago Review, and Best American Poetry 2002. American Rambler (Thorp
Springs), a digressive narrative in verse, was published in 2000 and a
daybook, The Flood and The Garden (First Intensity), was released in 2002.
Notes No Answer, a chapbook (Habenicht), came out recently, and Effing Press
published the book Black Stone. Smith has worked as a laborer, editor, and
teacher variously since moving to Austin, Texas, in 1996.

Basil King attended Black Mountain College as a teenager in the 1950s, and
he completed his apprenticeship as an abstract expressionist painter in San
Francisco and New York. Since that time, his art has taken a different turn,
starting with abstraction and reaching back to surrealism and forward to a
new approach to the figure.

Although he did not begin to write regularly until 1985, an involvement with
poetry has always been part of his life, first in doing art to accompany
poems in books and magazines, and now as a poet/painter. Some of his larger
paintings can be seen on the Web at the Spuyten Duyvil, Light & Dust, Avec,
and Marsh Hawk Press sites. His books include Split Peas, Miniatures,
Devotions, Identity, The Poet, Warp Spasm, and Mirage: A poem in 22 sections
(Marsh Hawk Press 2003), which has a section of seven reproductions of
King's paintings. A new book of poems, A Painter's Bestiary, is forthcoming
from Marsh Hawk Press in 2007.

"I would erase anyone with the D-9, and I have demolished
plenty. I wanted to destroy everything. I begged the officers, over
the radio, to let me knock it all down; from top to bottom. To
level everything. When I was told to bring down a house, I took
the opportunity to bring down some more houses.
For three days, I just destroyed and destroyed. The whole area. I
wanted to get to the other houses. To get as many as possible. I
didn't see, with my own eyes, people dying under the blade of the
D-9. But if there were any, I wouldn't care at all. If you knocked
down a house, you buried 40 or 50 people. If I am sorry for
anything, it is for not tearing the whole camp
down. I had lots of satisfaction in Jenin, lots of satisfaction. No
one expressed any reservations against doing it. Who would dare
speak? If anyone would as much as open his mouth, I would have
buried him under the D-9."

From a statement by an IDF bulldozer driver in Jenin.

The before which house Corrie was killed, as is well established, was owned
by a pharmacist and his family who had nothing to do with terrorism. There
are photographs of Corrie standing in front of the bulldozer, clearly
visible, dressed in red, with a megaphone, in the seconds before her death.

Collective punishment is a war crime under UN conventions. I guess we should
all get with the progrom, Harry?

All of which you say is true, Mark - except for the fact that - as with the
invasion of Iraq -  we have the same actors (Cheney, Rumsfeld - John Bolton)
and they are picking up the drumbeat(war) of doing damage to Iran. The
'wisdom' they have shown in their decisions of the last five years
(post-Iraq, Gunatanamo, etc.) shows no evidence of a learning curve that
will take these guys off this potential course of action - unless certain
factions in Israel beat them to it.
Of course an  invasion or even a bombing of nuke facilities in Iran would be
a fiasco - as per yr good analysis - in which nothing but horror and chaos
in the mideast would ensue. And it would not rescue the Republicans. It
would be much cheaper to keep rigging voting machines and gerrymandering
districts and making sure these primarily corporate owned small states with
two senators (Wyoming, Idaho, etc.) stay low populated, except for the
mandatory import of non-voting migrant labor.

Pretty crazy making - but maybe, or has it, always been the same!!??

Flora,
Poetry is matter, though it matters not. =20

Will a poem stop an RPG, or launch one?
Will a poet be all she can be
writing to affect tomorrow's history? =20

I think not.

  Subject: Does Poetry Matter?


  I know this can be an annoying and naive question, but I mean it.

  Mr. Nudel reminded me that the more horrors I read about and the =
scarier this country and others become in my lifetime, the less I am =
interested in reading a post-post-postmodernist poem about the state of =
things and the more interested I am in changing them -- or at least =
understanding them enough to be educated in an election year ...

  So, as annoying as it is, I'm asking all of you who seem to care about =
poetry as much as I (think) I do (or did): Does it matter? Does it do =
anything? Does it change anything or anyone? Are other media taking it's =
place? Is it evolving to the point that it is now something else? Do we =
have anything to say that will outlast our lifetimes?

  I am surrounded by corporate semi-literates most of the day, so I'm =
putting my watercooler talk here ...

"Poetry
the trick to read what can't be read,
quick to write what can't be said."
Gerry Gilbert

What are the conditions in one's own life that make poetry consequential or
not? If the work, and the work around the work--the life--are able to find a
way into writing what can't be said, and reading what can't be read--like
Gilbert said--then at least one has the sense that one might be on the right
track.

Regardless, for instance, of the political situation of one's nation.
Consider a Roman watching the forty-seventh prisoner being fed to the lions.
Or a citizen in Germany--who knows--in 1942 reading the news. Or a
USAmerican looking at Abu Ghraib. The thought crosses their mind what poetry
can amount to in their country, at the moment.

Yet, from our vantage point, we would welcome poetry that managed to address
those situations with intelligence and humanity. So that even if the
prevailing situation one finds oneself in is not conducive to the truth
being recognized, the act of trying to write it still has value. Not only
historical value, but value to oneself. And maybe some others.

And this is true regardless of the form of the poetry, ie, electronic or
print or whatever.

We are all imbued with language. We all try to work it out, at least in part
with language. That's how we think, and partly how we feel. Everybody has
that inner voice or two. As long as that's the case, poetry will still be a
potent and subtle force in the world.

Lawyer in "Da Vinci" Case Says Ideas Too General for Copyright  (USA
Today, February 28)

A lawyer for the publisher of The Da Vinci Code argued in court last
week that ideas which two writers claim were stolen for Dan Brown's
blockbuster novel are so general they are not protected by copyright.
Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, authors of the 1982 non-fiction book
The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, are suing publisher Random House,
claiming that parts of their work formed the basis of Brown's 2003
novel, which has sold more than 40 million copies. The lawsuit, if
successful, could delay the scheduled May opening of the Tom Hanks film
based on Brown's novel.

Poetry makes me really happy and it makes a lot of other people I know
really happy because it's so damn interesting! Both as a writer and a
reader. Something Ann Lauterbach pointed out to me, too, (and I keep
returning to it in my mind and in conversations) is that poetry (and
art-making in general) is about choices. That's not the only things it's
about, but it's about CHOICES. And in a world where many people feel like
they have no choices, one place where you can make decisions that are
meaningful and on your own terms is in art-making. (now this is outside of
any pressure from publishing companies or whatever if you're involved with
all of that). And there's really no such thing as some kind of pure choice
independent from everything else, but it can feel so powerful.

I made this choice. No one else did. And no one else could make all these
choices the way that I did. And this matter of CHOICE in art/ life is the
most powerful thing I can think of.

Thanks,
Anna Vitale

I really appreciate what you're saying, and when I'm writing and in that moment and making those choices, it is a powerful feeling, but ultimately a selfish feeling. It is really only doing me good, not anyone else. I know that art, once it goes out into the world and starts affecting people, makes a difference for those people and maybe for the community as a whole, but I don't see how.

So maybe that's another issue. Poems and pictures and music get put in a frame or a book or a symphony hall and only reach certain people. Are the ones who are facing the worst of the world each day really benefiting from all this poetry? Are the people with access to these things taking them in, and if so, does it change how they live? Will poetry ever (again) have an affect on the social or political climate of the US? I really doubt it. I know there are so many directions to go from here. I know civilization needs and thrives on art, children need and thrive on art, art can guide moral philosophies and temper our completely aggro planet with beauty and awareness. But for poetry specifically, I feel that it has become so obscure and, in many ways, either so elitist or so much about putting on a show that it really can't matter.

And the funny thing is, I can call it a crisis of faith, but I can't even bring myself to believe that thinking poetry might be growing obsolete and impotent is a big enough deal to call a "crisis." Sudan is a crisis. The West Bank is a crisis. Doubting poetry is a crisis? That just sounds indulgent. And it's that very feeling that makes me think it doesn't really matter.

Then again, I could just be in a bad mood.

art-making in general) is about choices. That's not the only things it's
about, but it's about CHOICES. And in a world where many people feel like
they have no choices, one place where you can make decisions that are
meaningful and on your own terms is in art-making. (now this is outside of
any pressure from publishing companies or whatever if you're involved with
all of that). And there's really no such thing as some kind of pure choice
independent from everything else, but it can feel so powerful.

I made this choice. No one else did. And no one else could make all these
choices the way that I did. And this matter of CHOICE in art/ life is the
most powerful thing I can think of.

I've often wondered why people want to make a
connection between poetry (or any kind of art) and
direct, political action. There might be a connection,
but it's a tenuous one. But why does everything we do
have to do "anyone else" any good? Writing poetry may
be selfish: and if it is, does that really matter?
Maybe it does only a few people some "good," but the
same can be said of making love to your lover. Or
petting your cat.

Of course, I believe that poetry that manages to make
its way out into the world can do much more social
work than petting one's cat, but that social work,
again, is much more subtle and modest than the social
work done by, say, knocking on neighbors' doors and
discussing current ballot items, or getting people to
the polls, or organizing labor, etc. etc. But life is
never monolithic: we do many things, play many roles,
and, yest, writing and thinking about poetry can help
make us more thoughtful, observant people. Of course,
so can any number of other things. And conversely,
writing and thinking about poetry can fail to make us
better people (the Nazi elite, for instance, certainly
knew and loved their Western canon).

So, to my mind, it's not what we do, but how we do it.
And Flora, at least, seems to be bringing to bear a
positive, self-critical dimension to poetry writing.
Let's just hope it's not self-critical to the point of
paralysis.

Best,
Joseph

Come to New Orleans any Thursday night and listen as we have for six months now to the people here as they tell their stories, as they continue to trickle home and come to grips with the state of our city, as they channel their frustrations and their sadness and hear the laughter and the tears and the understanding that happens week after week here; and I think you'll find the answer to your question.  It matters so damn much some nights; it's all some people have to look forward to. And I wish that were not the case as much as I love poetry.

It seems so much more complicated. I also thought the post about "choices"
reflected only that kind of liberty back on to the writer, so in a sense
seemed somewhat narcissistic or "selfish," but on thinking more about it, I
know there is so much more to consider. Readers make choices, too, and
within works that are complex, those choices are critical to their own
understanding. Coming to know that readers, as well as writers, take
responsibility for their own understanding -- of a poem, and of the world,
seems critical to plugging into that world and acting responsibly. In this
way, I think of poems that are quite challenging and not primarily
"message" poems where the message is clear (and may or may not be
political) as requiring more of us as readers, and thereby giving more back
to us, as we learn our abilities and choices as readers and thinkers, and
hopefully, as citizens in the world. It's not a perfect circle, certainly,
but I'd rather not do without it.

In a more pragmatic way, the presence of poets on this list, as well as in
other communities in which I partake, has led me to understand how very
many political activists there are among poets, and has led me to be more
active than I might otherwise have been. Sure, many of these activists may
not be active "as poets" with regard to political causes, but I think their
activism within poetry circles helps spur them to other kinds of action. I
also think their activities as poets and intense readers of poems helps
them to develop their critique of governments, social systems, and other
entities for or against which they take up thoughtful political action. So
it's not a case of writing a poem whose message will galvanize thousands or
millions (though it might be), rather of working, through poetry (the
writing & the reading), towards greater understanding and communion with
the world in an abundant and enriching variety of ways. I see this
happening all the time, and as I see it, I am inspired by the work of poets
today, including their work within their poems and outside them.

Thank you Jim. Ultimately, this is the critical question in this
dialogue. Michael McClure said: "If poetry and science cannot change
one's life, they are meaningless." So if we use the praxis of poetry to
deepen our own consciousness, to seek to go to deeper levels, we find
that we can move into compassion and stronger fields of energy which of
course radiate out everywhere.

That is not to suggest that we must barracade ourselves in the work and
disengage in life outside of our study, or wherever it is we write. The
actions of Gandhi and Dr. King are very strong attractor fields, as are
the fields of Blake, Whitman, Williams, Olson, Duncan and other people
no longer here. We continue to be affected by their contributions. The
resonance of their work remains and impacts work being created now. It
was funny to read the Virginia Quarterly Review's feature on Whitman
last night and see how both the Bush Administration and those who oppose
their posicies, tried to co-opt Whitman for their own agenda.

As a poet, I'd love to be able to create something with the resonance
and power of Leaves of Grass, or Paterson, or The Maximus Poems and make
my contribution in that way. Yet, we never know what kind of effects our
work will have. The satisfaction must be in the doing of it, which makes
it consequential. According to Whithead, everything is an event, is in
the process of becoming. A poetry praxis can act to add momentum to the
process of becoming more human and of more use in every aspect of one's
life.

"Does it (poetry) matter? Does it do anything? Does it change anything or
anyone?"

Is poetry or art, for that matter, supposed to change anything at all ?
IT IS ABOUT THE CHANGE. IT IS THE CHANGE..(especially in the US, where it is
much of a subculture now)

I recently came back to this e-group after a gap of about two years and have
been noticing a plethora of e-mails everyday about the war in Iraq, about
the "Poets Against The War", about the media trying to choke political
freedom - (very little is said about poetry in this forum). Hundreds of
poets, artists and intellectuals have been reporting/condemning such acts of
crass insanity for a few years now. Has it changed anything at all ? Has the
war stopped ?

And what has become of poetry ? How many great poems have been written by
the "poets against the war" ? How many great anti-war poems do we remember ?
I see the "poets against the war" as just another group of common anti-war
protestors who are trying to hold out against this horrifying insanity. The
fact, that they are poets, does not make their actions non-plebeian; they
are no more powerful than any of the other protesters, not to mention the
poetry they are writing against the war.

Back during the Vietnam era, John Ashbery, in an interview said something
very similar. He questioned the artistic importance of anti-war poetry.
Every single anti-war cry is important in the world today and an anti-war
poem is just as important as that - but no more. But as a poem ?  Is it
important ?

Ashbery's comments were misread and misquoted; he was nastily grilled by a
leading daily columnist (I forget the name). Ashbery had to write a long
letter of justification to the daily trying to restate his position on the
war, trying to explain that he was against the war like anyone else. Going
thru that letter today, I feel pretty sad about the fact that a poet like
John Ashbery had to cite examples of several anti-war rallies where he
physically took part.

On the academic freedom thread I probably have too much to say having served
in my labor union, worked on grievance representation, etc.  And members of
the Buffalo list would be well-apprised of the deep connections between decent
pay, solid contracts, rights to fair representation and those of the ability
to speak and write publicly.  So today I will paste what just came over our
union's listserve regarding a colleague at a neighboring campus, Pomona
College who has been a guest speaker to our campus (Cal. Poly. Pomona).  This
received several responses so far, and I hope there will be an organized
response to this situation.  Additionally, a union officer from our campus
sent word that at yesterday's deans' council meeting it was announced that
unless there was a contract signed to engage a commencement speaker, there
will be no commencement speakers at any of the 23 Cal. State Univ. campuses
this year.  Apparently there is worry that a donor may find a speaker
offensive.  Many of us hope this is not set in an unchangeable way.

RE:  Academic Freedom


Estimado/as Colegas,

I write to inform you that yesterday during my office hours (Tuesday 2:30
-4:30) I was visited by two agents of the LA County Sherrifs/FBI Joint
Task Force on Terrorism  (JTFT).

The arrived at about 2:40-2:45 pm sat out side my office while attended to
a students, and then asked to see me.

They had with them a copy of my profile from the Pomona Web page, and
other materials I could not see.

After identifying themselves, they proceeded to ask about my relation to
Venezuela,  the government, the community, my scholarship,
my politics. They were especially interested in whether or not I had been
approached by anyone in the Venezuelan government or embassy to speak up
on Venezuelan related matters. In addition, they raised a whole host of
other troubling questions, too long to summarize here.

They also indicated that the visit to my office was part of a larger effort
to interview academics in the area. I do not know if this is happening at
other schools.


After they departed, the three or four students who were outside my office
informed me that these individuals had asked them about my background, my
classes, what I taught, my politics and they even wrote down the cartoons
that are on my door.

I consider this to be an attempt at intimidation and cast a pall on
matters of academic freedom.

I am planning a response, and I am open to your comments.

saludos

Of course, poetry matters.  The problem, at least in America, is that it matters only to poets, that is people who write poetry, thus its limited impact.  I, too, have asked myself if political poetry has ever changed anyone's mind about anything and have to suspect that the answer is that it has not. A question of preaching to the already converted, for the most part. Nevertheless, much wonderful and beautiful poetry has been written in America in the past hundred years or so.  Therefore, it does matter.  Of course, a lot of bad stuff gets out there, too.  As for what happens to it all after I or you or anybody dies, since we don't make those decisions, what is the point of even worrying about them or that?  Poetry lives, whether one person's faith in it continues to be strong or not.

So, as annoying as it is, I'm asking all of you who seem to care about poetry as much as I (think) I do (or did): Does it matter? Does it do anything? Does it change anything or anyone?

Welcome to the club, Steve.  The question is: how many legends, downtown and/or otherwise can you fit on the head of a pin?

here's something i'm learning at a painstakingly slow pace: if i
don't allow myself to feel joy, engagement and the creative process
working through me, how can i be effective in making others happy?
the world's suffering is limitless and it takes a lot of strenghth to
be effective in relieving it;  the best way to make yourself strong
is to be nice to yourself, which for me, includes being creative in
whatever way i feel, "exercising my faculties at large," and being
mindful of my health and emotional needs.  it seems pretty obvious
that poetry has a role to play in relieving human suffering.

It is confusing for me to follow this discussion because there is =
writing
poetry (praxis) as poetry, reading poetry (written by others), poetry as
object (perhaps art object) in the world, and meanings? of poetry --
political content, statements, etc. --=20

I don't know about poetry's use as therapy (the writing of it), of, when =
it
is narrative, using it to make a therapeutic narrative, of when it is =
very
emotional, using it as a tool to gain empathy -- seems so much like 101 =
uses
for a dead cat to me, this issue of poetry's practical application.  =
Even
dead cats can be practically applied.  For example, I was reading some
captivity narratives last night about a dog kill (dogs captured in some
Indian warfare a group of settlers got caught in the middle of) =
preceding a
hunt for a poetry quilt project of mine. =20

But I am also uncomfortable with -- of what use painting, sculpture, =
etc. --
does [products and practices we associate with civilization which has
leisure] matter? equally as does [a dead cat, poetry] matter?  does =
anything
with a practical application matter, does anything without a practical
application matter?

And I like what Maria wrote.  I mean, if you want to change the =
political
scene, then you've got to run for office.  You can write a poem and read =
it
and inspire somebody who has political office to change his mind, but =
that
is like changing a lightbulb with two George Bushes and a Reagan.

All best,
Catherine

P.S.  So is necessary poetry the most useful?  How or why does it matter
more?=20

  - I agree with this. I don't want to (nor do I) think of art as "useless." Art is in and of itself a vital part of personal and communal experience. I think, based on everyone's response, that looking for "usefulness" in poetry misses the point.  These are only conversations I get to have in the context of the listerv, so it's good to get other points of view and realize what it is I'm not taking into consideration. I can't expect everything I do that is worthwhile or beautiful to necessarily be useful.  It's enough, I guess, to just find it meaningful, and especially for others to find it meaningful as well.

dear all, i like matter as a verb.  i like responding to horror with rapid
bursts of humankindness fire, not turning the other cheek perhaps, but
intensifying the goodness factor in the world around me.  i learned that
from native hawaiian friends, one in particular who practices it in her
daily life.  i can't always manage it myself, but then neither can she.
it's a practice, i'd say.  i understood drn's outburst as sardonic but
also viciously so, and still agree that, and this is also something taken
for granted by native hawaiian friends, words are enormously powerful,
whether used for ill or good.  and it "matters" when we put vicious words
out into the universe.  i don't think that's new-agey and weird.  we
understand it about newspeak and advertising and all that "truth
manufacturing."  socrates was trying to get across the same principle; so
was wittgenstein.  love is glue; so is hate.  i've tried both.  love feels
better.  hmmm.  i really like gertrude stein's talk about nouns as calling
out the name of someone/something you love.  ae.  gabe

I think I like the idea of the Legislation (that's why I use a caps "L") Im=

 we'll save when everyone is dishing out money to get documentation! Imagin=
e the trickle-down effect!

Bless you, Kevin, for not writing a poem! You're on my side! You're a true =
American! I'm not writing a poem either because it's just useless. Poetry i=
s useless. Writing a poem to save a life is like killing immigrants so we d=
on't have an immigration problem, or, killing immigrants and sucking the wa=
ter out of their bodies so we don't have an irrigation problem.

See, that's wordplay, not poetry. Get a grip, my friends, we're headed for =
destruction, that Dee Eee Struction. Please, write a poem to save some sper=
m: jerkoff or write on! Lakoff!

hey, isn't this a lovely call and opportunity to say what it is we
actually are doing?  i'm living in a small cabin with a very good dear old
friend in northern california, just went out to pick armsful of firewood
that have fallen from oak trees.  not working right now--working working
--when i do, lately, i adjunct teach wherever they'll have me and/or edit
and/or small writing jobs.  this coming summer i'll help an organic farmer
here in exchagne for veggies.  friend and i are in community radio locally
and push for collectives wherever and whenever we can. been doing that for
a long time.  do too  much email, am temporarily shamed from time to time,
but love it, keep in touch with friends worldwide who also push for
collectives and loving relationships in the world.  best, gabe

Charles' response is more carefully considered than mine. But that's totall=
y
what I was trying to get at. I would hate, however, for the liberty of bein=
g
able to make a choice, artistic, or otherwise, to be conflated with
narcissism or selfishness. Because as Charles says later, these choices hav=
e
to do with critical thinking. And it's powerful to be able to think
critically.

And because critical thinking is part of the experience of both making and
experiencing art, the relationship between art and direct political action
is not tenuous at all. I'm not sure how to understand moving from something
cerebral to "direct political action", the ACTION, but it doesn't make sens=
e
to me to try, to try and draw some definitive line when something inside
moves outside into the world. Some kind of internal action turns into actio=
n
outside, if that makes sense. Actions, thoughts, activity, artistic and
political, are not all that separate, they're not individual objects
floating around in space alone never touching each other. They touch each
other, meet, get involved. In trying to think of how art effects something,
I get caught up in isolating it and trying to treat it as separate from the
rest of what's around it and realize that's problematic.

I certainly understand that art in the U.S. is very isolated, and possibly
poetry in particular, since there's not big museums with free days that
schools make kids to go to with poetry in them! (I think of that example
because I'm a school bus driver and just drove some kids to the
African-American History Museum in Detroit yesterday). But I think poetry
does brush up against people's lives in ways that are unexpected and whethe=
r
that makes them anti-war or not seems like an unimportant question,
actually. I think whether it has meaning is much more crucial . . .

I'll just leave it there . . .

Best,
Anna Vitale

[A couplet to the sea. A disaster wrecked upon itself]

by Adam Clay



A couplet to the sea. A disaster wrecked upon itself

and upon the promise of eternal exile.

One Holy City replaced by the answer

a voyage promises.

                            Inland, the sea is no more

a fragment. The definition one has for "control"

resides in how much one has been controlled,

not only by the sea, but by the land and others

who also live on it.



This is the joke that swallows its own tail.

This is the hope that wrestles a hotel.

Hi everyone,
Someone asked 'does poetry matter ?'
What can we do  ? We're poets and have to keep writing
poems. And we can write letters, articles,
demonstrate, vote  - we are also citizens.

This piece might be useful when doubt comes creeping
(like every day) :

Michael Palmer's optimistic and instructive piece.( I
think it was linked on Ron Silliman's blog if I
remember correctly.) Anyway here's
the url if you're interested in pursuing it -

All good wishes,
Pam

Read my poems. They matter. They're these little machines, see, and when you
read 'em (or read into 'em *gasp*), you will change into someone else or
your money back! I haven't sold any so that's a good deal, I think,
therefore I am.

Go back to e-sleep and no one will wake you up, but my poems will rattle on
all the same. How many anti-war poems? Dangit! It was your turn to count 'em
this week! Grrr...

In my opinion, Alex is right on this, I'm afraid. Love matters little. Compassion is quite a different story. If one be honest, and I'm cynical in part because of all I've seen, what is this tower we're looking at, and can we access it worth objectively. What is it composition, furthermore. What kind of change does any of it really lend itself to -- given the fact that tongue are cut out, voices muted, ear run over, simplistic slogans or jingles puked out, foolish political causes taken up. What kind of education is the public being given byway of our work, and how're we able to garner followers in a era of swift change. I've lived or traveled through most of the world's surfaces -- me in my mid30s, sat down with female refugees who's family members were brutalized with such things as 'eclectrocution-style dildos," fed kids bits of meat and watched them stand on their hind legs as if I were passing along most basic nutrition to a strays, seen rot and hopelessness, watched peo
ple talk
 about totalitarianism and war as if we didn't know squarely what it was. This is real. Compassion in the face of those aspects of our humanity that make us just plain unattractive.

  And I admire, am willing to submit to some of what has been said, offered, but let's sit down and do some real work. The middle-class has its bit of the pie, and those crusty bits dropped to others shouldn't make us feel as if our table is open, I wonder. It's selfishness that abounds, desperation, an inability to sit down and say something remotely honest and truthful.

Yes, yes, yes--poetry is (relatively) marginalized, but I'm not  convinced that it doesn't have some role in the lives of people who  don't write and publish their own poetry. And I'm not wholly convinced  that there might not be some advantage to working from that margin. But  to better conceptualize this, Lyn Hejinian, in her essay, "Barbarism,"  writes about poetry as a border practice, and that the border is in  fact in the center, not some dejected margin, an interstitial,  "between" space. She goes on to productively (in the Althusserian  sense, if I'm getting it right) read Adorno's famous line about the  impossibility/barbarity of (lyric) poetry after Auschwitz as an  imperative to write "barbaric" poetry, recalling the etymology of the  word in an onomatopoeic formulation of babble, as it was used to  designate foreigners who couldn't speak properly (i.e., didn't speak  Greek). Adorno himself privileges the imcomprehensibilty of Modernist  art as the cite of its "pol
itical"
 resistance.

  I think poetry and critical theory both work on the language, on the categories of intelligibilty that matter "reality" (in the sense thatword as a verb which Judith Butler made famous with her book Bodies That Matter). This work is very slow. I don't think that direct, immediate action that affects public policy is (or necessarily should  be) possible through poetry (though what I personally almost always  feel is "bad" art often has been used for polemical purposes). That's  simply a different sphere of praxis. I don't believe, ultimately,  however, that you can have substantive, structural change (change in  modes of subjectivity/subjection, if I can be lazy and not interrogate  those terms just now) without, precisely, the Adornos and the  Hejinians.

  Immediate political action provides the needed triage and emergency  care for crises ranging from disaster relief to civil rights  viloations; poetry, theory, and the arts work on the very language  itself, on vocabulary, images, metaphors, structures of intelligibilty,  ways of knowing/being/becoming, modes of subjectivating--take your  pick--by which we can think to even acknowledge the other, let alone  respond to her needs. There can be no human rights violation without an  at least implicit proposition of what constitutes the human. Poetry, I  think, is one cite of this activity.

  That all sounds horribly simplistic to me and I'm sure open to all  kinds of criticism, but I stand by it as a good starting point. I see  no reason why we as individuals can't, if we choose, be both poets and  activists--in the narrowest sense, mind you--but we can't be  both--strictly speaking--(though we may read our poetry at gay marriage  rallies and anti-war demonstrations) at the same moment.

  Best,

  Tod

Thomas savage <tsavagebar@YAHOO.COM> wrote:Of  course, poetry matters. The problem, at least in America, is that it  matters only to poets, that is people who write poetry, thus its  limited impact. I, too, have asked myself if political poetry has ever  changed anyone's mind about anything and have to suspect that the  answer is that it has not. A question of preaching to the already  converted, for the most part. Nevertheless, much wonderful and  beautiful poetry has been written in America in the past hundred years  or so. Therefore, it does matter. Of course, a lot of bad stuff gets  out there, too. As for what happens to it all after I or you or anybody  dies, since we don't make those decisions, what is the point of even  worrying about them or that? Poetry lives, whether one person's faith  in it continues to be strong or not.

Flora Fair  wrote:  I know this can be an annoying and naive question, but I mean it.

Mr.  Nudel reminded me that the more horrors I read about and the scarier  this country and others become in my lifetime, the less I am interested  in reading a post-post-postmodernist poem about the state of things and  the more interested I am in changing them -- or at least understanding  them enough to be educated in an election year ...

So, as  annoying as it is, I'm asking all of you who seem to care about poetry  as much as I (think) I do (or did): Does it matter? Does it do  anything? Does it change anything or anyone? Are other media taking  it's place? Is it evolving to the point that it is now something else?  Do we have anything to say that will outlast our lifetimes?

I am surrounded by corporate semi-literates most of the day, so I'm putting my watercooler talk here ...

Yes, I've always liked this, too -- but I think the crux of it is the WAY
in which it is true. Williams was not one to insist on the content being
the important thing to be found, rather, I think, the way in which poems
work. So it really makes the poem, and finding one's way within it,
analogous to the world, and finding one's way in that. The process or path
of the poem offers valuable lessons in negotiating meaning, and in
negotiating and coming to understand the relationship between self and
other. To encounter Williams's poems is to encounter meaning being found,
and made, in words, at every step. It is to be open to uncertainty, change,
and all the possibilities that might come one's way. So yes, what is found
there is essential.

The solution then, obviously, is to get rid of the professors entirely.
Because if we can't get it together to create thoughtful and constructive
spaces outside that framework, then it must be their fault. No, we're not
jealous or anything that they somehow represent (from the outside) a model
of heroic or symbolic humanism that we fail to achieve in the crappy
drudgery of our everyday lives. And we're not trying to simply make them pay
for acting as the synechdoce of this in a reality that fails to support it..

Is info labor not labor? Is the paranoia and emotional exhaustion and "being
everywhere" of such info-work not utterly draining? Is service labor not
labor? Is not academia SOCIAL? Then why is it invariably everyone's
scapegoat?

To heck with Joey Ramone. How is hitting 3 chords "labor"?

Well said, Charles...in a dark time, we don't withdraw, we circle and renew
this spark among sympathetic peers. And some of that sympathy is aesthetic,
and some is political. I don't think we could get rid of the overlap between
those categories even if we wanted to.

In a more pragmatic way, the presence of poets on this list, as well as in
other communities in which I partake, has led me to understand how very
many political activists there are among poets, and has led me to be more
active than I might otherwise have been. Sure, many of these activists may
not be active "as poets" with regard to political causes, but I think their
activism within poetry circles helps spur them to other kinds of action. I
also think their activities as poets and intense readers of poems helps
them to develop their critique of governments, social systems, and other
entities for or against which they take up thoughtful political action. So
it's not a case of writing a poem whose message will galvanize thousands or
millions (though it might be), rather of working, through poetry (the
writing & the reading), towards greater understanding and communion with
the world in an abundant and enriching variety of ways. I see this
happening all the time, and as I see it, I am inspired by the work of poets
today, including their work within their poems and outside them.

These statements are bunk.

The word/subject "poetry" is consistently among the top search engine
queries, ever since they started counted the keywords people type into
search engines! Poetry sites are also the most heavily visited Web
destinations.

The only problem are *narrow* definitions which bamboozle a *rampantly

D,

  The fact that a term is searched more often than another is not case in point poetry is either read to or disseminated to a larger, less exclusive audience then, say, ourselves. Your playing spin games, like those politicians who mistakenly presuppose their agendas are worth preserving.

I don't listen to anything. My mind gets so focused on what I'm doing that
it blocks out the music. It could also block out explosions, I think. So, I
don't turn on what I'm not going to hear. I save it for later, when I can
concentrate on it.

i listen to soma fm online radio. Groove Salad.

i work (for money that is) as research assistant coding interviews with a
qualitative data analysis program. i work mainly in the middle of a busy
library so i like the buzz around me but i need the ambient beats.

people with ADD will tell you that since their brains are understimulated
they need a little white noise to babysit and keep the spare brain bits
occupied while they focus on the task at hand. my favourite place to read
at UWO was under a broken fan in a corner of the library.

the disadvantage of having online radio and headphones on while working is
that the little ping of the inbox takes you out of work mode to answer the
door to see whether it is news that you can now get pills to help
you ejaculate like a porn star or the missus asking you to grab milk on
the way home.

ok back down into the datamine,
kevin

Derek,

  Did you actually READ the rest of my post? Don't quote me out of  context, such that you reduce a much qualified argument to a simplistic  statement. But even in what you quote, there is the small qualification  of "relatively."  However, it IS true--fortunately or  unfortunately--I'm not entirely sure--that poetry doesn't enjoy the  same level of popularity as most of the other arts. The reasons for  this might coincide with the potential resistance that (some) poetry  (at least, if not, possibly though I tend to think improbably, all)  enjoys.

  I recently heard that Amy Tan received $40,000 (or was it $50,000) to  give a 90-minute talk. Any poets out there gettting that? Any book of  poetry out there sell more than a million copies (the average press run  is, what, 1,500) ?  And maybe we never would WANT to, given what  that would entail for the quality of our work, but, nonetheless, poetry  is less popular than (mainstream, best-selling) fiction, (Hollywood)  film, and so forth. Even youngish painters can sometimes make a living  from selling their artwork; this simply isn't possible for poets (it's  equally hard for experimental and documentary filmmakers, dancers and  choreographers, and tons of small, struggling theaters).

  The undergrad poetry workshops here at Brown almost never fill up,  while the fiction workshops turn away as many as they accept. And a  large number of students are far less interested in actually reading  poetry than in writing their own. I think most of them would be  perfectly happy just workshopping one another and not reading much of  anything else. And I find their taste in poetry to be largely  frightening (Maya Angelou, Stephen Dobyns, Robert Frost, and Mary  Oliver pop up a lot).

  I'm as frustrated as anyone that people seem to think "why bother"  because of this situation (and frustrated at times WITH this situation)  but I'm certainly not one of them. But poetry's relative (there's that  word again, Derek) unpopularity has been rehearsed over and over, and  what's REALLY frustrating at the moment is that you completely neglect  the rest of my post, where I said everything (if anything) of substance  I had to say about how and why I think poetry DOES matter.

Some ways that poetry has been used:
- Can't remember what conference, but a poem was used to explain a very
elaborate scientific concept that could be explained no other way (if anyone
knows the specifics, please share)
- Almost every religious truth is given in the form of poetry and/ or
requires some for poetical analysis. One of the biggest problems with the
Christian Right is they have no sense of this level of understanding.  In
another specific instance, one of the early patriarchs of Zen Buddhism (I
believe the Sixth) was chosen based on only one poem that he wrote. At the
time, he was simply a gardener and not an actual monk.

- A haiku of Basho was used by Ian Stewart to Explain chaos theory (Does God
Play Dice)

and I am sure someone can create a more extensive list. Now I would like to
quickly address what appears to be a sentiment behind some of the postings
on this subject. It feels as though there is a sense that poetry is not
connecting, it is being written and not really received or incorporated. For
me, I have a difficult time relating because I have been fortunate to see a
direct benefit to my work (for me, and in sharing for others). One quick
example, a stanza of one of my poems is being used in a promotion for a
recovery addicts shelter. It's simple things like this that make me want to
distribute my work, and it truly energizes me.

En fin, does poetry matter? Of course!

Social exclusion and cultural creativity


...during the period of colonial- ism in their histories, "social
exclusion" from regular work and income has been a long term and dire
experience. Yet social exclusion was not social death; social exclusion,
with its enforced leisure, produced forms of cultural creativity which
engendered marvels of reality, "le realisme merveilleux," in Jacques
Stephan Alexis's ...The same is true for the genius of the unemployed in
Kingston, Jamaica, who, in their leisure created Rude Bwoy and Reggae,
of whom the most famous exponent was Bob Marley. No one, in the original
moment of creativity, would have dreamt of such marvelous creations,
especially coming from such excluded sections of society, from Frantz
Fanon's Wretched of the Earth.



Social exclusion and cultural creativity
by John La Rose

For tens of millions of the world's people, especially during the period
of colonial- ism in their histories, "social exclusion" from regular
work and income has been a long term and dire experience. Yet social
exclusion was not social death; social exclusion, with its enforced
leisure, produced forms of cultural creativity which engendered marvels
of reality, "le realisme merveilleux," in Jacques Stephan Alexis's
phrase or in the words of Alejo Carpentier: "lo real maravilloso."

Looking back at the Agora in ancient Greece, we see the outlines of this
process. The Greek skole or leisure, from which words like scholar and
scholarship originate, allowed for time, for discussion, for debate and
interaction, which underlined the development of philosophy, drama and
democracy. It was the rigor of slave labor which made all this leisure
possible.

In the Caribbean the unemployed, in their enforced leisure, created
Calypso, the famous mass popular Carnival and Steel-band. It was the
unemployed from Behind the Bridge in Port of Spain, Trinidad, who
created the language, the music, the dance, the instruments, the
organizations, which gave birth and originality to these institutions.
They were like any other artists - with time for withdrawal into intense
moments of creativity, working for hours and hours at their art form and
producing brilliant episodes of invention.

Each of these marvels of creativity also engenders extensive forms of
productive activity: carnival bands, calypso tents, carnival tourists,
more hotels, the invention and production of unique instruments for a
wholly new type of orchestra, work for tuners who tune them,
compositions, studios, agents, concerts, exports, travels for
orchestras, tours internally and abroad, arrangers, cassettes and CDs,
programs for the radio, TV, books, journals, the press.

The same is true for the genius of the unemployed in Kingston, Jamaica,
who, in their leisure created Rude Bwoy and Reggae, of whom the most
famous exponent was Bob Marley. No one, in the original moment of
creativity, would have dreamt of such marvelous creations, especially
coming from such excluded sections of society, from Frantz Fanon's
Wretched of the Earth.

We have only to think of the massive popular creativity of African
Americans in their world of social exclusion and segregation: their
Negro spirituals, the black church with its sustaining spirituality, its
inspired and influential musical forms, its foundations for oral
expressiveness and invention, its inspiration for, literature; and then
the blues, jazz and now rap, and the constant inventiveness in language,
dance, music, art, style and fashion.

This creativity, provides a praxis of transculturation, profound in its
world impact and interaction among the peoples of our planet. (It)
provides a different apprehension of social exclusion beyond the
negative function of social death.

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

On Earth: Last Poems and an Essay

Robert Creeley (1926-2005) has published more than sixty books of poetry, prose, essays, interviews and in the United States and abroad, including _If I Were Writing This, Selected Poems 1945-1990, The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1945-1975,_ and _The Island._ His many honors include the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Frost Medal, the Shelley Memorial Award, and the Bollingen Prize in Poetry. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and Distinguished Professor in the Graduate Program in Literary Arts at Brown University.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Creeley


"Robert Creeley has created a noble life body of poetry that extends the work of his predecessors Pound, Williams, Zukofsky, and Olson and provides like them a method for his successors in exploring our new American poetic consciousness."-Allen Ginsberg

Robert Creeley, one of the most significant American poets of the twentieth-century, helped define an emerging counter-tradition to the prevailing literary establishment-a postwar poetry originating with Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky and expanding through the lives and works of Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, and others. When Robert Creeley died in March 2005, he was working on what was to be his final book of poetry. In addition to more than thirty new poems, many touching on the twin themes of memory and presence, this moving collection includes the text of the last paper Creeley gave-an essay exploring the late verse of Walt Whitman.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Creeley

I often write poems while listening at concerts.  Usually contemporary or modern classical music; once in a while, jazz.  I'm currently enjoying the fact that the New York Philharmonic has chosen to celebrate Elliot Carter before it's too late.  There have also been several concerts of Edgard Varese's music here in New York lately which I found inspiring inasmuch as I met him when I was very young.  He was very old, of course.  Meeting him in my teens got me interested in modern music.

which Indian city are you going to ?

if you really meant good cinema, try some Satyajit Ray films if you can -
Pather Panchali (song of the little road)
Aparajita 	(The Unvanquished)
Apur Sansar (The World of Apu)
Jalsaghar   (Music Room)

cinema can never be better without Ray.

family as I am going to hear Nicole Peyrafitte & the Pamplemousse =20
Trio (twisted jazz standards, poetry, French cabaret songs etcetera) =20
=97 I hear her repeating in the room next to where I type; son Miles =20
was extremely happy when I promised to pick up tickets for next =20
month's concert by Pearl Jam for all of us, though I am very happy =20
that he did not insist on schlepping me to Fall out Boy.

CD-wise my iTunes tells me that what I have been playing most (on my =20
desk) in recent days is:

Chavela Vargas, Macorina
Abeda Parveeb Mystric Poetry
Anouar Brahim, Khomsa
William Bolcom. Songs of Innocence and of Experience
Michael Bisio, Connections
Rabin Abou-Khalil, Blue Camel
Esbj=F6rn Svensson Trio, Strange Place For Snow
Bob Dylan, Blonde on Blonde

In the media/living room with the good soundsystem it must be:

Coltrane Live at the Half Note
&
Mal Waldron & Steve Lacy, Live at Dreher, Patis 1981

  MARCH 14TH, NATIONWIDE GRAFFITI CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE POLICE.


...This is a call to all the members of the Other Mexico, so that this
14th of march, international day against police brutality, they
demonstrate, in whatever way they find convenient, against the
repression that the bad governments exercise against our peoples.

I PROPOSE THAT ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE SAME TOPIC, AND/OR

THOSE EDUCATED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT 911 WAS DONE BY

THE FBI, CIA, NATIONAL DEFENCE AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS AND

BUSINESS PEOPLE ALSO PARTICIPATE, EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT

this 14th of march, international day against police([search])

THIRD.- We propose:
.-That that day everybody sends, to the space we’re going to open at the
Elace Zapatista webpage (http://www.enlacezapatista.ezln.org.mx), a list
of repressive acts that they have suffered from the authorities,
testimonies, drawings, photos, etc, where we demonstrate our repudiation
against the police.
.-That the whole gang across the country does graffiti, banners, murals,
etc., according to however whoever does it.
.-That local forums are done, regional and state where they debate and
analizethis social cancer, known as the police.

Bob Marley as always.  These weeks it's the third disk of Songs of =
Freedom, which just keeps yielding & yielding.  I was thrilled 2 weeks =
ago, though, to discover I could listen to Erik Satie: Piano Works =
straight through & love every note of it.  Usually I'm impatient with =
everything except Bob.  In my 20th century poetry class, besides Satie, =
it's been Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstong, Stravinsky and =
Cats.
Last night I watched Rent and was underwhelmed by the music.  Not long ago =
I listened to Sinead O'Connor's Throw Down Your Arms, which was interesting=
.  I don't listen to music when I'm writing though.  I listen in the car, =
though that's not exactly right.  I drive music around in the car, very =
loud.  I drive a carful of music.  I lodge in the car with music.  Music =
blasts me around Providence.  Something like that.

Auden was not a historian.  Three of the seven signatories of the 1916 =
Proclamation of the Republic were poets: Thomas MacDonagh, Padraig Pearse, =
and Joseph Plunkett.  All seven signatories were executed but the =
"rising," though variously understood in the last 90 years, undoubtedly =
made a lot of things happen.  I think these men probably went into action =
*with* poetry; they did not lay it aside.  Maybe too, Bobby Sands, 65 =
years later, who also wrote poetry, took it with him on his final active =
service, i.e., hunger strike.  I do not mean to single out Irish Republican=
s.   I've also been thinking of the International Brigades.  And I am sure =
people bring poetry with them into all sorts of struggles.  Auden has his =
limits.  Langston Hughes framed a language for plenty to happen decades =
later.  Langston Hughes made nothing happen????  Come on.  It seems the =

educated, articulate, literate, privileged people, makes nothing happen.  =

Dear Mary Jo,

Why read Nudel's remarks as inflammatory & do nothing?  Why save your =
annoyance for "the futility of proselytizing"?  Why not be annoyed at =
someone who is degrading and demeaning someone?  Why be annoyed instead at =
the hapless utopians, as you characterize them?

I am thankful that there are people who believe that making one creative =
or educational gesture in a community, then doing it again, and again, =
night after night, makes a difference, to all involved.  I think it's a =
lot easier to have one's eyes glued on the more powerful, and to massage =
one's own relative powerlessness, than it is to recognize one's power in =
relation to those less powerful, with whom one is surrounded, and to apply =
the power one has.

I do believe words matter.  I choose them as best I can.  I understand =
Harry Nudel's posts regarding Rachel Corrie as hateful.  I wrote to the =
Poetics list managers a few days ago to inquire as to list policy on hate =
speech.  I got two automated replies but nothing else. =20

I think that Harry Nudel's hateful remarks are acceptable on this list =
because they were directed at someone who does not matter: a young woman =
who is dead.  I don't take this as a marker of tolerance, because the list =
is quite tightly controlled in terms of what can be posted, and at what =
frequency, although it may be a marker of general tolerance of misogyny.

I think if Harry Nudel had made similar remarks about a white male poet, =
recently deceased, there would have been much protest.  When Robert =
Creeley died, almost a year ago, post after post came bearing witness to =
him.  Words mattered then.  Perhaps no-one on this list knew Rachel Corrie =
but we are not distant from her, or people who knew her, or who know her =
family.  Words matter now too.

As a member of this list, I don't think *I* matter in any sense to the =
list managers.  I intended to sign off  -- but then came the music thread.

Mairead,
=20
I read Nudel's remarks as inflammatory.
=20
However, I don't believe the Absurdist point of view to be any less valid =
=20
than an optimistic perspective. The absurd approach to life is neither =20
convenient, clever, nor easily arrived at. I don't know much about Fish =
except  his=20
text & reader theory which is interesting. The Absurd, as demonstrated  in =
the=20
works of Ionesco, Beckett, Camus and Sartre and the  "deconstructionists" =
are=20
more relevant for my argument. Other than preservation  of the planet =
and=20
species, what is absolute? Some can even argue that saving  this madness =
is itself=20
insane. Of course that can put one in the religious  fundamentalist or=20
anarchist camps where "heaven" or post-apocalyptic  campfires await. =
However, I don't=20
begrudge anyone their personally  devised utopias. It's just the futility =
of=20
proselytizing for such that  annoys me.  =20
=20
Those of us who walk the line between hope and absurdity know there are =
few =20
success stories. I'm sorry if I bristle, but examination of world history =
and=20
my  own personal life leaves me sad and helpless against such cyclical and =
=20
overwhelmingly tragic situations. When you begin to contemplate all sides =
of =20
each argument, the ambiguities are paralyzing.  =20
=20
That individual lives are improving qualitatively because of art,  can =
be=20
argued. That the human condition or the world has changed quantitatively  =
can=20
not. When I mentioned Bianco Luno's controversial statement a few days =
ago,  I=20
was picking a philosophical fight over the which scraps of human endeavor =
make =20
any real difference.

Artists and other kinds of people find it hard to admit that their lives  =
may=20
be futile, so they find meaning and purpose through their work or  =
obsession.=20
But their choices are only that, personal choices, based  fundamentally =
upon=20
their genetic and cultural situation. An  individual might rise above =
their=20
situation; and yes, often because of  art or a special person(s) investment=
 of=20
time and money.=20
=20
I'm not saying we shouldn't try. In my camp, not expecting too much has =
=20
never disappointed me. And if I cry too much about it all, I often end up =
=20
laughing at the absurdity. That is, until I start crying again. Advocating =
 absurdity=20
doesn't make the world more absurd. In fact, advocating most anything  is =
in=20
itself absurd. I doubt that anyone loves this place the same way I  do.=20
=20

" But the Left Conference got me thinkin'...how many poets on this list
work in any industrial setting...how many do any physical labor as an
integral part of their job..my guess is 99 per cent are info workers..."

I used to be a physical laborer. Kind of had the romantic idea that it
would make me purer. Of course, I had the privilege of choice. Got sick
of it. Went to graduate school, an older student. Dream job? Read books
and get paid to talk about them. Now I do that. But all those damn
compositions to grade!

" Can success be predetermined by the school you went to...."

Had a job interview a few weeks ago. Went good. Got the letter of
intent. Then got the letter of appointment. Ah, assistant professor of
language and literature. However, I went to New College of California.
Where? With who? Did what? Most of my interview was affirming the
efficacy my educational background. I must've convinced them, but my
school opened no door for me.

I wasn't go to say anything further.

But fuck it.

Misogyny is every bit as deadly as racism. It kills thousands of women every
year. So is it acceptable on this list? Is objecting to the degrading
reduction of women to mere sex toys for men "fascist feminism"?

This is a big problem Stateside, people's tongues being cut out because we don't like what they say -- on the left, right. And look what you got, a great big shit hole filled with doddering gits. Breath is liscense. For God's sakes, you need to get out, smell the world, see just how absurd you sound. Your construction, I'm afraid, is yesterday's news.

Perhaps I ought to explain myself, instead of making rude impatient noises.

I think Mairead is perfectly correct to call the misogyny on a post which,
in response to the story of a play about Rachel Corrie being pulled by the
NYTW, imagines the dead young woman in question seduced by an untrustworthy
oriental intellectual who finishes by sodomising her corpse.

I am not interested in asking that Harry Nudel be thrown off the list or any
such thing. Nor does not being racist in one circumstance mean that you
can't be sexist (or racist) in another. But those who claim that calling
that offensiveness is "cutting tongues out" might also think about the
people whom this kind of speech effectively silences. Or is sexual violence
just a great big joke? Only, perhaps, to those who can't easily imagine
themselves the victims of it.

All best

Tod:
..|  Any book of  poetry out there

Oh, I don't know, the hardcover edition of "The Prophet (!) by Kahlil
Gibran is ranked #525 in Books at Amazon. That's got to be worth some
$$$.

Kooser's hardcover edition of "The Poetry Home Repair Manual: Practical
Advice For Beginning Poets" is ranked #1,910. That also must generate
some $$$.

Elizabeth Bishop's paperback "The Complete Poems, 1927-1979" can't be
doing too badly ranked at #2,944 despite a new offering
(http://amazon.com/gp/product/0374146454/).

Whitman's paperback classic "Leaves of Grass" comes in at #4,192 and
Bukowski's hardcover "Come On In!: New Poems" ranks in at #4,569.

Does that satisfy a thirst for $$$ generation in poetry?


..|  poetry doesn't enjoy the same level
..|  of popularity as most of the other arts

Poetry is extremely *more popular* than other art forms, according to
Web queries.

The recent hitwise data I recently forwarded clearly showed 'poetry'
(#8) given the highest attention from internet users [right along with
'Paris Hilton' (#2) and 'Jessica Simpson' (#6)], whereas 'lyrics' (#20)
lagged not-too-far behind and 'radio stations' (#23), 'music' (#45), and
'song lyrics' (#68) appear much further down the list (all these
rankings are excluding adult queries btw, which would send everything
down a few hundred spots). The closest thing we get to *art* might be
'tattoos' (#92) otherwise *art that is not poetry is simple not on
people's radar*. But 'poetry', as the numbers show, is fabulously
popular and, of course, not even close to your recent (qualified) label
of 'marginalized'.

I think you're talking in terms of dollar signs as your measurement of
success, which is a very capital way of thinking, but, nonetheless, not
an accurate gauge of reality.


..|  nonetheless, poetry is less popular than
..|  (mainstream, best-selling) fiction,
..|  (Hollywood) film, and so forth

Yes, it is as a dollar-generating industry. I refer you to the bold
truth re: poetry (still unanswered) from Bukowski (excerpt from "Po in
Motion"): www.derekrogerson.com/sounds/buk.mp3 (1.72M)

"...as much energy as a Hollywood industry, as much energy as a stage
play on Broadway... all it needs is practitioners who are alive to bring
it alive... it's not appreciated is because it hasn't shown any guts, it
hasn't shown any dance, it hasn't shown any moxie..."


..|  a large number of students are far less
..|  interested in actually reading poetry
..|  than in writing their own

And this is a problem, how? Write, write, write!


..|  And I find their taste in poetry
..|  to be largely frightening

Again, re: my last post, you can expand your narrow definition of
poetry. It would appear it is you (a practitioner) who is marginalizing
poetry yourself. Get out there and write some!

I think the general frustration with this topic is rooted in the understanding that poetry is not
a mass media, and American culture right now seems to privilege mass media over all others.  I
think it's important to understand the virtues poetry has both in _not_ being mass and in not
being like other artistic practices.

As an artistic practice, poetry is ridiculously cheap and has a very low access point (literacy?).
 It's not like architecture, where you have to get a degree, get licensed, and then either
accumulate capital or clients, and then maybe you get to build something.  Or film, where it is
not uncommon to spend way more time raising money than actually filming or editing.  It's not like
play writing, where you have to negotiate with directors and actors and whatnot.  It's not like
music -- you don't have to worry about whether the drummer's going to show up to rehearsal too
hammered to play.   You don't have to rent studio or rehearsal or storage space, unlike say
sculptors.  You don't have to worry about never doing it again because your body's shot (as in
dance).

Poets get to have lives with neither the blessings nor the curses of celebrity.  It's much easier
to have a conversation with a really awesome poet -- try doing that with a really awesome rock
star, or actor.  Poetry is an intimate art.  We know our audiences, and our audiences know us.

I can get some friends together and start a journal, or a press, or a reading series, for not that
much bread.  Try doing that with a restaurant, or a symphony orchestra, or a sitcom.  It is so
much easier to explore and experiment when you don't have investors wondering when they're going
to get their profits out of you.  And nobody's going to get fired if your poem's a flop, and
nobody's going to stop you from writing another poem if your last poem was a flop, or if only five
people showed up to that reading you gave at Cody's.

I don't know how many people will ever read my poems, no matter how good they are or how much they
might matter, and if I hadn't made peace with that a long time ago, I would have gotten out of
poetry a long time ago.  When people I don't know introduce themselves and tell me how much they
like my work, I feel like I've received this enormous gift.

As to whether poetry matters, so long as you buy into the idea that only mass medias matter, then
you're going to suffer TV envy and rock star envy and you're going to suffer and suffer and
suffer.  If you turn your attention towards how non-mass medias matter, you're still going to
suffer, but you'll be in good company.

but it's possible that harry noodles could make such comments about
member of the list and still not be removed.
think about how hostile people are to a moderated list, as if such a
thing were the violence in question.

fight for a better list, and ask to have such people removed.  you'd
have my support.

Perhaps I ought to explain myself, instead of making rude impatient

I think Mairead is perfectly correct to call the misogyny on a post
which,

in response to the story of a play about Rachel Corrie being pulled
by the

NYTW, imagines the dead young woman in question seduced by an
untrustworthy

oriental intellectual who finishes by sodomising her corpse.



I am not interested in asking that Harry Nudel be thrown off the list
or any

such thing. Nor does not being racist in one circumstance mean that you

can't be sexist (or racist) in another. But those who claim that calling

that offensiveness is "cutting tongues out" might also think about the

people whom this kind of speech effectively silences. Or is sexual
violence

just a great big joke? Only, perhaps, to those who can't easily imagine

themselves the victims of it.

Alison and Mairead aren't asking for Harry to be removed from the list, but
for recognition that he is expressing various things that deserve censure.

Is that "fascist feminism", Harry? Or are you describing Hannah Wilke's work
as "fascist feminism" (read a couple of interesting articles on her at
http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/zoebrigley/entry/deconstructing_the_feminine and
http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v82/ai_15406252 ).
"Yum"?

You may be allowed to say what you will, but others are also free to call
you on what you say. That isn't fascistic. I recall a net artist who called
more or less anyone a fascist motherfucker. Particularly anyone who
disagreed with the net artist. The pseudo-political language seemed a mask
for self-absorbed myopia. Language as stick to get one's way.

I would just say that this is the tension between reading literally and

those who read scriptures literally rather than figuratively. This is as
much an issue in Judaism and Islam as it is in Christianity. Case in

Yes, as should be apparent to anyone who's actually read my twoprevious  posts on this subject, I wholly agree! There are constraints to that  kind of popularity that I would never want to contend with. I don't  want anyone telling me what or how to write.

  Derek, your new subject heading implies that I am equating whether  poetry "matters" or not with whether it makes money, which I never even  came close to doing. I was using the economic reality to point to  poetry's relative lack of popularity. In a capitalist society, this is  a legitimate barometer. I sketched out in my first post on this subject  how I think poetry can matter. You might want to try actually reading  it.

  This little poet was quite the rock star last night and now has to go back to bed...

a mass media, and American culture right now seems to privilege mass media over all others.  I
think it's important to understand the virtues poetry has both in _not_ being mass and in not
being like other artistic practices.

As an artistic practice, poetry is ridiculously cheap and has a very low access point (literacy?).
 It's not like architecture, where you have to get a degree, get licensed, and then either
accumulate capital or clients, and then maybe you get to build something.  Or film, where it is
not uncommon to spend way more time raising money than actually filming or editing.  It's not like
play writing, where you have to negotiate with directors and actors and whatnot.  It's not like
music -- you don't have to worry about whether the drummer's going to show up to rehearsal too
hammered to play.   You don't have to rent studio or rehearsal or storage space, unlike say
sculptors.  You don't have to worry about never doing it again because your body's shot (as in
dance).

Poets get to have lives with neither the blessings nor the curses of celebrity.  It's much easier
to have a conversation with a really awesome poet -- try doing that with a really awesome rock
star, or actor.  Poetry is an intimate art.  We know our audiences, and our audiences know us.

I can get some friends together and start a journal, or a press, or a reading series, for not that
much bread.  Try doing that with a restaurant, or a symphony orchestra, or a sitcom.  It is so
much easier to explore and experiment when you don't have investors wondering when they're going
to get their profits out of you.  And nobody's going to get fired if your poem's a flop, and
nobody's going to stop you from writing another poem if your last poem was a flop, or if only five
people showed up to that reading you gave at Cody's.

I don't know how many people will ever read my poems, no matter how good they are or how much they
might matter, and if I hadn't made peace with that a long time ago, I would have gotten out of
poetry a long time ago.  When people I don't know introduce themselves and tell me how much they
like my work, I feel like I've received this enormous gift.

As to whether poetry matters, so long as you buy into the idea that only mass medias matter, then
you're going to suffer TV envy and rock star envy and you're going to suffer and suffer and
suffer.  If you turn your attention towards how non-mass medias matter, you're still going to
suffer, but you'll be in good company.

I’ve come to treat Nudel’s diatribes the way I respond to the bitter little man who gets up every morning only to stand on the local street corner for hours, shouting and raising his feeble fist at passers by, spitting into the wind, all in the name of “free speech”.  This behavior says much more about that man’s condition than serving as productive on any social level.  One might instinctively like to reach out and reason the poor soul through his agony, but the moment a person approaches to connect on a human level, his tactics turn to reductive name calling and even more exaggerated mockery.  Of course, he is within his rights…

  I’d like to believe that the reason Nudel’s posts haven’t raised a ruckus on this list is because of shared sentiment towards him:  he is mostly deleted due to his long history here of transparent attention-getting antics.  His mockery of Rachel Corrie would never have made my radar had not certain list members responded to him – nor does his new call for attention register as surprising so much as a sad cry for social contact from one lonely man who viciously clings to debased modes of interaction.  But the implications of his latest extends beyond the simple free speech cliche, “I wrote it just because I can.”

  One of the issues at hand then might be:  How free is free speech?  Rachel Corrie risked and lost her most important possession, her life, for what she believed to be a noble cause.  Nudel most likely thinks his mockery of Corrie is just as noble an act in the name of defending free speech.  Nudel though isn’t really risking anything here as he is typically ignored and now seems only more desperate in his call for attention.

  Obviously unproductive and slanderous, Nudel’s speech is indeed free for him, and he hopes it will even pay back via a few misguided defenders of free speech in his name.  Corrie’s act was altruistic on the whole with a certain cost.   Nudel’s is rooted in a myopic selfish desire and perhaps fueled by a hope to make some obscure statement, using blatant misogyny, related to his own political alliances -- a sad coupling that has long-term effects on many as we let it pass in silence.

  I imagine the listserv managers allow Nudel to carry on because of free speech, a right I desire and defend as well, but this issue goes beyond that.  I fear Mairead might be on target:  if he had slandered a recently deceased man, we would certainly be hearing more discussion of the merits of such free speech and the content therein.

Yes, but now we're having conversations about that very relativity. Not to
say that Nudel should have said what he said, but after his smoke has
cleared, it's been a pretty interesting discussion and has brought up some
points that probably wouldn't have been considered otherwise.

Thanks to all those who have written expressing the various ways in which
the original (in the temporal rather than the creative sense )post was
depraved, cowardly, misogynist and self-serving. I concur, and exercise my
limited right to free speech, which as Amy pointed out always has a price
even if someone else has to pay for it, in saying so.

Further, the idea that a decades old communion wafer, even if ingested on
the "wrong" side of a segrationist rope, can somehow function as a
never-expiring blank cheque offends my sense of comedy, never mind theology.

Depressing times for the list.

              like harry nudel

I am a poet.
  I am Palestinian.
  Like harry nudel, I live in New York City.
  Unlike harry nudel, I am relevant, what I do, what my organization does matters.

  When Rachel Corrie died, I grieved, but wondered why those others who grieved her death ignored the countless deaths of Palestinians who died for the same reason as her.
  But when white activists began dying in the south during the civil rights movement in this country, people started paying attention. So it goes.

  harry nudel is an anti-semite. His venom, his paternalism towards, and out and out racism against Arabs, specifically Palestinians (who like Jews, are Semites, after all) is clear. Actually, I blocked his emails shortly after joing the Poetics list in 2004.

  What bothers me even more than the miniscule, irrelevant and pathetic Nudel, is when seemingly intelligent, good-hearted people, specifically poets have ignored the suffering of my people.

  Here I will allow that about four weeks ago, I corresponded with someone who is quite visible on this list. The person had put out a call for poets to take an involvement regarding a specific issue. When I responded to the person, mentioning the fact that I was Palestinian, they replied : "Know that I am very sympathetic to the Palestinian situation but of course I am careful of voicing my support since so many editors and people of power do not share, lets say, a balanced position on the Palestine issue."

  This disturbed me on so many levels, it would take too much time for me to say how much here. I will say, though, that whatever perceived reprisals the person feels they would have gotten for voicing their support of Palestinians, such as the loss of a business opportunity, would be a lot less than Palestinian children who die every day under the U.S. funded Israeli occupation of internationally recognized Palestinian lands.

  I will also let the cat out of the bag here and say that people in this country who otherwise would be interested in supporting the Palestinian cause for self-determination have been scared off by the new McCarthyism: anybody who supports Palestine and Palestinians is colored an anti-semite.

  At this point, I don't give a fuck, frankly. For anyone who wants to say that I am an anti-semite for telling you the truth, for talking about my Palestinian life, my Palestinian memory, my Palestinian body, my Palestinian suffering, so be it.
  The truth is the truth, and the last I checked, poets were supposed to be concerned about that- Palestinain poets, Israeli poets, Jewish poets, Muslim poets, American poets, yada yada yada.
  The fact that a flea, a nothing like harry nudel, essentially wants me and my people to die makes me laugh. Like I said, I ignored Harry Nudel shortly after I found out who he was.

  It is the other people on this list who concern me.

Thanks Jennifer for the original post in this thread. Yesterday's march in
Chicago was a peaceful 100,000 strong. An excellent grassroots mobilization
effort. I don't see that the story was picked up by the AP or any other
national source however.

Ever since when in college, when two high school friends moved to Israel, I
have been over this barrel over what and whom I "support."  The first man I met
to sit next to in college was a Palestinian in Western Civ.  I lived in a
women's dorm.  We were lucky in that the issues in Madison were relatively
balanced -- the Jews tended to be liberal and not Zionist to the exclusion of
worrying over the Palestinians.  Now I report to a Palestinian tobacconist to get my
(expensive) natural cigarettes.  This guy is a friend!  His shop is like a
water cooler.  Water cooler talk is barely allowed at work, but there at the
tobacco shop, people hang out just a little while longer to hear conversation
about the world, politics, and the crazy tobacco industry.

Thanks for your post --

I've been thinking about this discussion, and I'd like to publicly offer a
word of support to Mairead, Allison, Amy & others who have called out Harry
for his behavior (the more appropriate term than speech, I think, in this
case).  I am now a happy lurker on this list, and frankly I often delete
what look like discussion threads unread, for various reasons.  Harry
Nudel's posts are another matter.  I almost ALWAYS delete his unread,
because I've learned exactly what to expect, and frankly I feel his brand of
venom is not worth my energy or time.

So, like Amy, I would never have been aware of his original post if others
hadn't brought it up.  I don't want to spend too much time here expressing
my opinion of Harry.  It's not that he doesn't deserve it; it's just that
I'm convinced that he, like possibly one or two others here, thrive on the
attention... and the last thing I want to do is boost Harry's fragile,
retaliatory ego.  Better that he turn that dark energy in on himself...
which, believe me, I'm sure he does.

Where does this leave us as a list?  I'm not sure.  There are (relatively)
clear rules against flaming other list members.  What did Nudel do, flame
the dead?  His post clearly offended many, and touched a raw nerve.  That's
hardly a crime though, right?  No, at least I hope not (note to self: read
up on the recently passed extension of the Patriot Act).  Is it a violation
of list etiquette?  Probably... well, almost certainly.  But it wasn't a
flame against any other list member (unless Edward Said might happen to be
lurking out there).  Well, I'm not so sure.  Was Harry's post misogynist?
My answer would be, No-- it was JAW-DROPPINGLY misogynist (and I don't
consider myself particularly over-sensitive on this subject).  So would
something like Harry's post, especially if it passes without public comment
or censure by the list administrators, be likely to contribute to an
environment on this list where women feel uncomfortable taking part in the
discussion, or even subscribing?  (Not to mention the issue of anti-semitism
against Palestinians-- which I thank Paul for speaking to).

I don't really think I need to try to answer that question, even
rhetorically.

Sincerely,

Mark DuCharme

okay, i dive in here...  drn's original post made me feel really icky
and, in fact, ashamed for someone who might write such an unnecessarily
revolting scene.  is that what it was meant to do?  what was the point?
are we not supposed to ask such things?  rachel corrie, as far as i know,
was an idealistic, good young person, not unlike my daughter.  why would i
want such imaginings thrust in my face?  and how does it help things to go
on a tirade about edward said without any explanation or attempt to make
communication clear?  again, what is the point?  it doesn't seem as though
the point is to communicate at all, rather to fling down an insult of some
kind?  anyway, ick.  g

Robert Fisk talks a little further on this question in the Independent,
specifically on the Rachel Corrie question, but also other attempted
suppressions of open debate on Israel and Palestine:

"You've got to fight. It's the only conclusion I can draw as I see the
renewed erosion of our freedom to discuss the Middle East. The most recent
example - and the most shameful - is the cowardly decision of the New York
Theatre Workshop to cancel the Royal Court's splendid production of My Name
Is Rachel Corrie."

black banned from a job because of his association (hastily disavowed) with
a group called Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine.

There is something very wrong with going around "blocking emails";
having a heart full of hate; censoring and seeking to destroy everything
which exists that doesn't fit into a comfortable vision; constantly "at
war". This won't do. We can't progress as anything if we constantly
choose to go around voting against each other, voting each other
off-the-island, unwilling to show any compassion for other beings. I
know it's a very Judeo-Christian thing to *blame* something, to make it
pay, that without the blood sacrifice nothing can move forward with
completeness, but I think it's time to grow up a little.

Edward Said is dead too, unfortunately.  Harry Nudel's lewd images of =

Yes, Amy, I too have a delete key and perhaps should have used it.  I =

>>> markducharme@HOTMAIL.COM 03/12/06 12:38 AM >>>
I've been thinking about this discussion, and I'd like to publicly offer =
a=20
word of support to Mairead, Allison, Amy & others who have called out =
Harry=20
for his behavior (the more appropriate term than speech, I think, in =
this=20
case).  I am now a happy lurker on this list, and frankly I often =
delete=20
what look like discussion threads unread, for various reasons.  Harry=20
Nudel's posts are another matter.  I almost ALWAYS delete his unread,=20
because I've learned exactly what to expect, and frankly I feel his brand =
of=20
venom is not worth my energy or time.

So, like Amy, I would never have been aware of his original post if =
others=20
hadn't brought it up.  I don't want to spend too much time here expressing=
=20
my opinion of Harry.  It's not that he doesn't deserve it; it's just =
that=20
I'm convinced that he, like possibly one or two others here, thrive on =
the=20
attention... and the last thing I want to do is boost Harry's fragile,=20
retaliatory ego.  Better that he turn that dark energy in on himself...=20
which, believe me, I'm sure he does.

Where does this leave us as a list?  I'm not sure.  There are (relatively)=
=20
clear rules against flaming other list members.  What did Nudel do, =
flame=20
the dead?  His post clearly offended many, and touched a raw nerve.  =
That's=20
hardly a crime though, right?  No, at least I hope not (note to self: =
read=20
up on the recently passed extension of the Patriot Act).  Is it a =
violation=20
of list etiquette?  Probably... well, almost certainly.  But it wasn't =
a=20
flame against any other list member (unless Edward Said might happen to =
be=20
lurking out there).  Well, I'm not so sure.  Was Harry's post misogynist? =
=20
My answer would be, No-- it was JAW-DROPPINGLY misogynist (and I don't=20
consider myself particularly over-sensitive on this subject).  So would=20
something like Harry's post, especially if it passes without public =
comment=20
or censure by the list administrators, be likely to contribute to an=20
environment on this list where women feel uncomfortable taking part in =
the=20
discussion, or even subscribing?  (Not to mention the issue of anti-semitis=
m=20

I don't really think I need to try to answer that question, even=20
rhetorically.

   One of the issues at hand then might be:  How free is free speech? =20
Rachel Corrie risked and lost her most important possession, her life, =

what she believed to be a noble cause.  Nudel most likely thinks his =

Nudel though isn=92t really risking anything here as he is typically =

and now seems only more desperate in his call for attention.

   Obviously unproductive and slanderous, Nudel=92s speech is indeed free =

I think that's far-fetched to the point of irresponsibility. On the
other hand, given that men have been killed in an almost identical
manner in an almost identical situation, it might be useful to
discuss why the news media made nothing of their deaths. I suspect
that it may be that Corrie being a woman, and cute, and American, had
something to do with her becoming a postergirl.

Is it really necessary for me to assert that I also think that Nudel
went way too far? I'm afraid it is, which seems a shame.

I have liked, really liked, little NYC vignettes that Nudel has posted
in the past. That said (or Said), I was absolutely bloody shat off by
the infamous Said/Corrie post -- not merely because it seems a
particularly grotesque attack on the deceased (who are after all past
caring), but because it is a deliberate attempt to provoke precisely
this thread of outraged discussion, and perhaps push one of the offended
into saying something untoward ourselves. How pleased he must be! Nudel,
Nudel, Nudel. Of late, postings to this list have had more Nudels in
them than a bowl of chicken soup.

Usenet (remember that?) quickly evolved a rule: don't feed the trolls. I
think it's pretty clear by now that (a) the majority of those who feel
like speaking out on the issue are pissed off; and (b) the listowners
aren't, particularly. Their silence speaks terabytes. So the rest of us
-- those of us who don't equate supporting Palestinian independence...
scratch that, the right of Palestinians not to be killed like rats...
with hating all Jews everywhere -- might similarly turn our backs on
this idiotic post. Yes, I am, as a woman and a rape survivor, completely
disgusted. I'm not sure that discussing this to death (har har) will
advance the issue beyond the fact that a lot of us would like Nudel to
be, say, put on moderated posting status, but the listowners seem to be
happily not giving a shit.

And finally: I've known the poetry of Ezra Pound. Nudel, you're no Ezra.

Dear List cohorts:

Seems to me most of you are off point. (though I admit I've read some =
fine and intellectual horse shit here).=20

I remember reading many years ago about the rape committed by the boxer, =
Mike Tyson.  One of the things that struck me as sad was that the young =
lady, a 19 year old as I recall, stupidly went to the hotel room of the =
boxer at about 11:30 p.m. =20

I kept thinking through out the rape trial...isn't there a punishment =
for  going to the man's motel room at that hour of the night?  And where =
was that young lady's head?  Was she thinking: Hey, I'm the lady! I'm in =
charge!  Ain't no body gonna defile me and get away with it? =20

Of course, he didn't get away with it...the young lady, who ventured =
into dangerous territory walked away winners.  And Mike Tyson went to =
prison.  Hmmmmmmmmm....sorry ladies, but to my thinking, there was a =
mutual sin here.  True enough, Mike Tyson should have tossed the lass =
out into the hallway of the hotel and told her to get her ass home.  =
But...and this is the painful part of the message: the lass shouldn't =
have been where she was!  If Mike Tyson did 3 to 5 for rape, the silly =
lass should have done an equal 3 to 5 for stupidity.  I mean, this guy =
was big as a truck.  He beat  up guys bigger than himself for a living; =
why the hell would you think you were some kind of sanctuary just =
because you were the lady? =20

That said, I reach the conclusion on the current issue at hand. =20

1. Rachel Corrie was an idealistic idiot.  Sometimes idealists die =
supporting their ideals.  sad...true.
2. The world treats idiocy cruelly and with inequality...Yep!!!
3. The best vehicle for stopping such idiocy is ironic satire. =
(Satire...duh! what's that?)=20
4. Satire oft requires intellect beyond the capabilities of some =
readers....hmmmmmm am I one such?

And from that I ponder: is Harry Nudel's posting misogynistic?  or is =
H.N.' posting satirical? =20

Beats me...

  I've been thinking about this discussion, and I'd like to publicly =
offer a=20
  word of support to Mairead, Allison, Amy & others who have called out =
Harry=20
  for his behavior (the more appropriate term than speech, I think, in =
this=20
  case).  I am now a happy lurker on this list, and frankly I often =
delete=20
  what look like discussion threads unread, for various reasons.  Harry=20
  Nudel's posts are another matter.  I almost ALWAYS delete his unread,=20
  because I've learned exactly what to expect, and frankly I feel his =
brand of=20
  venom is not worth my energy or time.

  So, like Amy, I would never have been aware of his original post if =
others=20
  hadn't brought it up.  I don't want to spend too much time here =
expressing=20
  my opinion of Harry.  It's not that he doesn't deserve it; it's just =
that=20
  I'm convinced that he, like possibly one or two others here, thrive on =
the=20
  attention... and the last thing I want to do is boost Harry's fragile, =

  retaliatory ego.  Better that he turn that dark energy in on =
himself...=20
  which, believe me, I'm sure he does.

  Where does this leave us as a list?  I'm not sure.  There are =
(relatively)=20
  clear rules against flaming other list members.  What did Nudel do, =
flame=20
  the dead?  His post clearly offended many, and touched a raw nerve.  =
That's=20
  hardly a crime though, right?  No, at least I hope not (note to self: =
read=20
  up on the recently passed extension of the Patriot Act).  Is it a =
violation=20
  of list etiquette?  Probably... well, almost certainly.  But it wasn't =
a=20
  flame against any other list member (unless Edward Said might happen =
to be=20
  lurking out there).  Well, I'm not so sure.  Was Harry's post =
misogynist? =20
  My answer would be, No-- it was JAW-DROPPINGLY misogynist (and I don't =

  consider myself particularly over-sensitive on this subject).  So =
would=20
  something like Harry's post, especially if it passes without public =
comment=20
  or censure by the list administrators, be likely to contribute to an=20
  environment on this list where women feel uncomfortable taking part in =
the=20
  discussion, or even subscribing?  (Not to mention the issue of =
anti-semitism=20
  against Palestinians-- which I thank Paul for speaking to).

  I don't really think I need to try to answer that question, even=20
  rhetorically.

  I've come to treat Nudel's diatribes the way I respond to the bitter =
little=20
  man who gets up every morning only to stand on the local street corner =
for=20
  hours, shouting and raising his feeble fist at passers by, spitting =
into the=20
  wind, all in the name of "free speech".  This behavior says much more =
about=20
  that man's condition than serving as productive on any social level.  =
One=20
  might instinctively like to reach out and reason the poor soul through =
his=20
  agony, but the moment a person approaches to connect on a human level, =
his=20
  tactics turn to reductive name calling and even more exaggerated =
mockery. =20
  Of course, he is within his rights.

     I'd like to believe that the reason Nudel's posts haven't raised a =
ruckus=20
  on this list is because of shared sentiment towards him:  he is mostly =

  deleted due to his long history here of transparent attention-getting=20
  antics.  His mockery of Rachel Corrie would never have made my radar =
had not=20
  certain list members responded to him - nor does his new call for =
attention=20
  register as surprising so much as a sad cry for social contact from =
one=20
  lonely man who viciously clings to debased modes of interaction.  But =
the=20
  implications of his latest extends beyond the simple free speech =
cliche, "I=20
  wrote it just because I can."

     One of the issues at hand then might be:  How free is free speech?  =

  Rachel Corrie risked and lost her most important possession, her life, =
for=20
  what she believed to be a noble cause.  Nudel most likely thinks his =
mockery=20
  of Corrie is just as noble an act in the name of defending free =
speech. =20
  Nudel though isn't really risking anything here as he is typically =
ignored=20
  and now seems only more desperate in his call for attention.

     Obviously unproductive and slanderous, Nudel's speech is indeed =
free for=20
  him, and he hopes it will even pay back via a few misguided defenders =
of=20
  free speech in his name.  Corrie's act was altruistic on the whole =
with a=20
  certain cost.   Nudel's is rooted in a myopic selfish desire and =
perhaps=20
  fueled by a hope to make some obscure statement, using blatant =
misogyny,=20
  related to his own political alliances -- a sad coupling that has =
long-term=20
  effects on many as we let it pass in silence.

     I imagine the listserv managers allow Nudel to carry on because of =
free=20
  speech, a right I desire and defend as well, but this issue goes =
beyond=20
  that.  I fear Mairead might be on target:  if he had slandered a =
recently=20
  deceased man, we would certainly be hearing more discussion of the =
merits of=20
  such free speech and the content therein.

Mr. Rogerson,

  The last time I checked, I had the right to block whosever email address I desire.
  To equate my actions as a lack of maturity, to admonish me "to grow up" is uncalled for.
  Your tone is paternalistic, made worse by the fact of instead of addressing me personally through a back channel, you posted your admonition in a very public forum.
  My choice to block Mr. Nudel was a very personal one not based on the fact that I am not Jewish or Christian (I was actually born to a very devout Catholic family and I have a Masters in Liberation Theology), but rather that I understood him to be racist.
  It was my right to do what I did. To admonish me this way is extremely unfair and uncalled for, especially due to the fact that you do not know me.

There is something very wrong with going around "blocking emails";
having a heart full of hate; censoring and seeking to destroy everything
which exists that doesn't fit into a comfortable vision; constantly "at
war". This won't do. We can't progress as anything if we constantly
choose to go around voting against each other, voting each other
off-the-island, unwilling to show any compassion for other beings. I
know it's a very Judeo-Christian thing to *blame* something, to make it
pay, that without the blood sacrifice nothing can move forward with
completeness, but I think it's time to grow up a little.

Visited Sakkara Carpet School once in Egypt. Yup, young boys and girls
weaving carpets with their little fingers. Fingers too big by teenage
years. Claimed they happened to earn more money in a month than the
whole of their families. Claimed they spent their mornings in their own
school, and public ed in Egypt is crap. Claimed the carpet weaving kids
got the best student-teacher ratio around, except for the rich in

All,

  We cannot misuse words -- misogyny, racism, antisemitism -- because when we do, these words, mean nothing. Can I hear another "Amen!" -- tumbling onto my knees, praising Lord above!

  It serves no purpose, for I am far away, living in China, and under the umbrella of a totalitarian regime, where voices are muted daily and people too often exist as hot house flowers do -- secure, observant, but without the ability to pass through their translucent shells, for me to either defend myself or anyone else via this keyboard.
  In the old days, I would communicate with RC about my fears, conundrums, misunderstandings, frustrations, and I suppose I was hoping for some dialog here. There's been little else, but pretense (pompousness?), I'm afraid. Our political system is inoperative and repugnant, some might argue, for this reason -- and for also why so many find themselves disenchanted (on both left, right). This is just an extension of the construct binding our communicative environment, let me say. And still here I go. "A-men...Amen..A-Amen...sock it to me now!"

  I have spent my life, and there is a long paper trail, as they say, of my actions with regard to uplifting the situation of dis-empowered individuals, and I have done certainly not enough, because I can't, but have done I think, perhaps, more than, say, some (if not most) on this list. In June, at my own risk, I will return to my friends in the Himalayas and attempt to establish what will be a press -- and do this at my own risk. Now, I will be in NYC on 30 March, should you wish to attack me there.

  Alexander Jorgensen was born and raised of the most common and mixed stock. An insistent traveller, he has lived in the Czech Republic, a Baroque Servite monastery along the Sumava mountain range, the Galapagos Archipelago (on San Cristobal Island), and the People's Republic of China(where he currently resides and works). Additionally, he has sought adventure in such disparate places as Milwaukee and the Himalayas (where he will be returning in early summer).

  My point is this, _expression, which is our right, and should be exercised ideally with forethought, is what free people must defend. In the US, I am afraid to say, and this is the general view of those outside, seem to have forgotten lots about this. Words, seemingly, one could argue, mean far more than the actual use of one's mind and hands. It is hypocrisy I am against. Too, I am against the philosophical tendencies of many Stateside, as I remember them, observe them from afar, which seeks to demonize ideas or those individuals who might share ideas vastly contrary to our own -- as if history has demonstrated our ability to hammer out what is right, as if history has demonstrated our ability to create a static truth, as if history had demonstrated that while we do our best, we know where we are going, as they say.

  Stephen Vincent, you can delete my e-mails, either because of what is perceived as my ignorance, lack of talent, views spoken with lack of articulate strength, but my anonymity (which I'm not looking for) is preserved, like you, and it is this safety which preserves and abides your sense of self. Talk to former dissidents in Eastern Europe, as mates over beer, to monks who'd been jailed for 40 years over their faith, to a Kasmiri trader about how young girls are forced into making rugs, only to have both their eyes and hands misused and damaged, to Liberians who honor Taylor (inspite of his barbarity) for his ability to wield power as a proud African in contrast to colonial adventures, to a Tibetan refugee (because they come every day, though their actions and motives no longer fashionable) who knows his heart byway of his naval and his faith byway of his father (His Holiness) and yet ponders the use of arms.

  I've had enough of this list. I'll just go out and speak to some 'real people' -- and this applies, I assure you, and with respect to both Harry and his detractors, who I think have been rash in their statements (but perhaps we're all prone to feeling a bit too important time to time) only to some.

  And to those who've denegrated Harry for being a flea, as someone said, or for not counting, as some said, I'll refer to RC who said to me, "I'm an old country western singer." At best of times, we bask in some light, not sure what, and perhaps that light comes only byway of our work and what it inspires in us -- in worst of times, I would argue, we're not public intellectuals, but private academics, snobs, whores, people who do not use our voices or energies without delineating purpose or, as I've said, compassion.

Maybe we need to cut each other some slack.

I think there's a lot of room for misunderstanding. Particularly with
Harry's way of writing eliptically. I've noticed that it can often be
interpreted a couple of ways. I didn't know of Hannah Wilke's picture that
says "Beware Fascist Feminism", for instance, when I replied to Harry's post
that mentions her and that picture. Though I suppose the implication is
we're experiencing some 'fascist feminism' on the list. I don't think so.
But we do need to cut each other some slack.

Also, I think the moderators were wise to stay out of it. They can't really
legislate these things, even if they wanted to, maybe even particularly if
they wanted to. These sorts of issues have to be worked out among the people
on the list. Our appeal, on lists, has to be more to reason and art,
compassion and sense, poetry and justice, truth and beauty, than to the list
moderators. These arbiters hold more power, it seems, on a list, than the
moderators, in good times, perhaps. And are more shadowy than the
moderators. But we sense them from time to time.

Bedtime for this space cowboy.

i'm having trouble understanding the anger & frustration that nudel's
sub-genet rape scene has stirred up. however crude, anti-semitic, or  misogynistic
they may be, words are words. sticks & stones, you  know? if anything, his
ramblings help reveal just how pathetic he and his  cohorts really are. he's
almost helpful in a "wow, now i remember why  i'm an anarcho-socialist" sorta way.
i joke. seriously tho, he's  a troll; if you don't feed trolls, they don't
stick around.

but i really do wonder -- what would we do with the jean genie  were he
posting on this list?

maybe the us media  made little of corrie's death because there isn't much to
make of it. she was  a privileged middle class chick who threw herself before
a bulldozer.  her thoughtless sacrifice ("sacrifice") did zero to aid the
palestinian cause  (which i fully support). youthful idealism got the better of
her. plus, so  far as i can tell, the media around here made more of the story
than it  makes re: true palestinian freedom fighters who've died for their
people.
my 2  cents.

actually, mark, to answer your question non-rhetorically, i think
not.  in fact, as you can see, Nudel's remarks have galvanized women
on the list.  i have appreciated Nudel's seasonal poetry and other
contributions he's made here, and may continue to.  and i must admit
to not having read his rachel corrie material b/c i had a pretty good
idea what it'd be, given comments on said, baraka, etc in the past.
there are other mechanisms, more subtle and not unique to the list,
that tend to keep women from feeling comfortable in public discourse.

uh-oh, it's come to this.  ok, now we're in classic misogynist
territory.  she was asking for it.  to me this is much more specious
than nudel's original provocation, which was an elaborate, ugly
fantasy.

Is this a joke?! Am I, stupidly, taking the bait in responding?? Even  so, I feel better responding than letting it go. While I certainly  believe in personal responsibility, anyone who physically forces  someone to have sex with them is solely responsible for their own  actions--no excuses or qualifications. Celebrity in this country is  tantamount to deification, and most 19 year-olds, I think, would be too  trusting of any celebrity. She cannot be blamed for anything but being  19. But that's not even the point. Were she a 34 y-o woman who went up  to a man's hotel room precisely to have sex with him, changed her mind,  and then was forced, she would be no more culpable in that rape than  the poor girl that Mike Tyson raped. The man in each of these  situations would be solely responsible for his actions and should serve  a hell of a lot longer sentence than 3 or 4 years! It's frankly  shocking to me that this isn't completely obvious. It brings out my  misanthropic side a
lmost as
 much as the fact that rapes occur at all.  But then, it's the pervasiveness of attitudes such as Alex' that are  likely the condition of possibility for rape in the first place.

Seems to me most of you are off point. (though I admit I've read some fine and intellectual horse shit here).

I  remember reading many years ago about the rape committed by the boxer,  Mike Tyson. One of the things that struck me as sad was that the young  lady, a 19 year old as I recall, stupidly went to the hotel room of the  boxer at about 11:30 p.m.

I kept thinking through out the rape  trial...isn't there a punishment for going to the man's motel room at  that hour of the night? And where was that young lady's head? Was she  thinking: Hey, I'm the lady! I'm in charge! Ain't no body gonna defile  me and get away with it?

Of course, he didn't get away with  it...the young lady, who ventured into dangerous territory walked away  winners. And Mike Tyson went to prison. Hmmmmmmmmm....sorry ladies, but  to my thinking, there was a mutual sin here. True enough, Mike Tyson  should have tossed the lass out into the hallway of the hotel and told  her to get her ass home. But...and this is the painful part of the  message: the lass shouldn't have been where she was! If Mike Tyson did  3 to 5 for rape, the silly lass should have done an equal 3 to 5 for  stupidity. I mean, this guy was big as a truck. He beat up guys bigger  than himself for a living; why the hell would you think you were some  kind of sanctuary just because you were the lady?

That said, I reach the conclusion on the current issue at hand.

1. Rachel Corrie was an idealistic idiot.  Sometimes idealists die supporting their ideals.  sad...true.
2. The world treats idiocy cruelly and with inequality...Yep!!!
3. The best vehicle for stopping such idiocy is ironic satire. (Satire...duh! what's that?)
4. Satire oft requires intellect beyond the capabilities of some readers....hmmmmmm am I one such?

And from that I ponder: is Harry Nudel's posting misogynistic?  or is H.N.' posting satirical?

Beats me...

  I've been thinking about this discussion, and I'd like to publicly offer a
  word of support to Mairead, Allison, Amy & others who have called out Harry
  for his behavior (the more appropriate term than speech, I think, in this
  case).  I am now a happy lurker on this list, and frankly I often delete
  what look like discussion threads unread, for various reasons.  Harry
  Nudel's posts are another matter.  I almost ALWAYS delete his unread,
  because I've learned exactly what to expect, and frankly I feel his brand of
  venom is not worth my energy or time.

  So, like Amy, I would never have been aware of his original post if others
  hadn't brought it up.  I don't want to spend too much time here expressing
  my opinion of Harry.  It's not that he doesn't deserve it; it's just that
  I'm convinced that he, like possibly one or two others here, thrive on the
  attention... and the last thing I want to do is boost Harry's fragile,
  retaliatory ego.  Better that he turn that dark energy in on himself...
  which, believe me, I'm sure he does.

  Where does this leave us as a list?  I'm not sure.  There are (relatively)
  clear rules against flaming other list members.  What did Nudel do, flame
  the dead?  His post clearly offended many, and touched a raw nerve.  That's
  hardly a crime though, right?  No, at least I hope not (note to self: read
  up on the recently passed extension of the Patriot Act).  Is it a violation
  of list etiquette?  Probably... well, almost certainly.  But it wasn't a
  flame against any other list member (unless Edward Said might happen to be
  lurking out there).  Well, I'm not so sure.  Was Harry's post misogynist?
  My answer would be, No-- it was JAW-DROPPINGLY misogynist (and I don't
  consider myself particularly over-sensitive on this subject).  So would
  something like Harry's post, especially if it passes without public comment
  or censure by the list administrators, be likely to contribute to an
  environment on this list where women feel uncomfortable taking part in the
  discussion, or even subscribing?  (Not to mention the issue of anti-semitism
  against Palestinians-- which I thank Paul for speaking to).

  I don't really think I need to try to answer that question, even
  rhetorically.

  Sincerely,

  Mark DuCharme

  I've come to treat Nudel's diatribes the way I respond to the bitter little
  man who gets up every morning only to stand on the local street corner for
  hours, shouting and raising his feeble fist at passers by, spitting into the
  wind, all in the name of "free speech".  This behavior says much more about
  that man's condition than serving as productive on any social level.  One
  might instinctively like to reach out and reason the poor soul through his
  agony, but the moment a person approaches to connect on a human level, his
  tactics turn to reductive name calling and even more exaggerated mockery.
  Of course, he is within his rights.

     I'd like to believe that the reason Nudel's posts haven't raised a ruckus
  on this list is because of shared sentiment towards him:  he is mostly
  deleted due to his long history here of transparent attention-getting
  antics.  His mockery of Rachel Corrie would never have made my radar had not
  certain list members responded to him - nor does his new call for attention
  register as surprising so much as a sad cry for social contact from one
  lonely man who viciously clings to debased modes of interaction.  But the
  implications of his latest extends beyond the simple free speech cliche, "I
  wrote it just because I can."

     One of the issues at hand then might be:  How free is free speech?
  Rachel Corrie risked and lost her most important possession, her life, for
  what she believed to be a noble cause.  Nudel most likely thinks his mockery
  of Corrie is just as noble an act in the name of defending free speech.
  Nudel though isn't really risking anything here as he is typically ignored
  and now seems only more desperate in his call for attention.

     Obviously unproductive and slanderous, Nudel's speech is indeed free for
  him, and he hopes it will even pay back via a few misguided defenders of
  free speech in his name.  Corrie's act was altruistic on the whole with a
  certain cost.   Nudel's is rooted in a myopic selfish desire and perhaps
  fueled by a hope to make some obscure statement, using blatant misogyny,
  related to his own political alliances -- a sad coupling that has long-term
  effects on many as we let it pass in silence.

     I imagine the listserv managers allow Nudel to carry on because of free
  speech, a right I desire and defend as well, but this issue goes beyond
  that.  I fear Mairead might be on target:  if he had slandered a recently
  deceased man, we would certainly be hearing more discussion of the merits of
  such free speech and the content therein.

  I also suspect most instinctively delete the Nudel/AJ positings - 99 times
  out of a hundred, as I do.
  But this odd, if not horrific necro-abuse of Rachel Corrie's body strikes me
  as the lowest form of cowardice, among other things. & hardly to whatever
  remain the aims of this list.
  Sadly, I suspect, these folks weirdly enjoy the abuse they get in return.

  If the List management must for whatever reason abide them, I opt out.

From time to time, we feel it is necessary to restate the policies of
this list. We ask all list participants to review the Welcome message,
which we include below.

Note that any correspondence sent to the Poetics List administration
account takes about ten days, for response; mail to this account is
checked about once per week.

We also want to reiterate one long-standing list policy:

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Wasn't the original idea of satire to effect change through wit? To  point out issues in the hopes of correcting their error? What issues do  you think Mr. Nudel is hoping to correct? Where, exactly, is the wit in  his writing? You can find the same kinds of things written on a  bathroom wall and just because it was posted here does not make it  valid. Or maybe it's just beyond the capabilities of my intellect. As  for that garbage about giving some girl prison time for making a bad  decision, there's so much wrong with it I won't even waste my time.

I'm with Alison, Maria, & Tod (posts read so far) on this one. Saliby's
comments are the ones that make me consider, like Stephen Vincent, leaving
the list. Yet the quick rejoinders from Alison, Maria, & Tod keep me here.
I don't think these ideas about women "deserving the blame" were ever
appropriate, but after discussions and publications (some of which I
thought constituted a cultural mind-change on these issues that was long
overdue) that I encountered when I was just exiting teen years, in the
mid-1970's, I didn't think I would hear comments like this again. I
certainly don't want to hear them.

The reality of globalism capitalism is that the terrible conditions in the
countries we are talking about. for most men, women and children, are the best
the same people have ever had.

I have been to those carpet workshops in Turkey also. At least where I went
the girls were teenagers. They were working in poor, decrepid cottages where
the only source of light was from the few windows. Everytime, their immediate
superviser was an older woman wearing one piece duster/frock as a sign of
authority and cleanliness.

Years before, just after the overthrow of Ciacescu, I was also in Bucharest,
Romania. There, mothers brought their children to the looms. The kids played
around while the mothers worked. Usually, again, the superviser was a woman,
this time (if I remember correctly) with a more military looking uniform.

What appears as horrible to the westerner is work to the inhabitants.

But Charles, if you left the list, that would leave it in that much
worse shape. Sure, then you could read it online, but we'd be
deprived of your voice.  The question is whether such unpopular (and
wrong) positions even warrant response.  Responding actually provokes
the crisis, as it draws the unreasonable ideas into enacting their
rhetorical and symbolic violence as those points of view can't find
their way by any other means.  It's not that we have to "police" this
list--community standards are policed all the time on the list. But
why should the the list be de facto in the "control" of people who
wish to abuse it and those to read it?

It may be that we don't want people with such views on the list. I
think that leads to a dangerous precedent. I'm all for mapping the
boundaries of what's acceptable, if its done with at least some
fartlike whiff of goodwill.

While it's okay to explore boundaries in order to determine where
they are, its another to flaunt community standards in order to
provoke people into declaring, via an expression of community
standards, "enough!" The listserv equiv of "suicide by cop" -- It's
happened before. So, a figure like Mr. Nudel might have been
persuaded to find that edge, and then back away.  The problem, it
seems, is that people like him find the edge then not only provoke us
all to push, but far too often jump all by themselves. It may be
satire, but it's cartoon-flat.

I'm with Alison, Maria, & Tod (posts read so far) on this one. Saliby's

comments are the ones that make me consider, like Stephen Vincent,
leaving

the list. Yet the quick rejoinders from Alison, Maria, & Tod keep me
here.

I don't think these ideas about women "deserving the blame" were ever

appropriate, but after discussions and publications (some of which I

thought constituted a cultural mind-change on these issues that was long

overdue) that I encountered when I was just exiting teen years, in the

mid-1970's, I didn't think I would hear comments like this again. I

certainly don't want to hear them.

I had not caught the initial posts which created all this controversy, so I
kept quiet. I for one have always read Nudel's posts. At least linguistically
they are among the most interesting. I am also an admirer of Mairead,
particularly her blog entries.

It seems we should be careful not to suggest expulsion everytime something
one doesn't like -or even one finds repulsive- is mentioned on this list.
Expulsion is like the nuclear option, best to be avoided at all costs.

Ciao,

Murat

    I will be showing strips from _Transverse_ at Nicole Peyrafitte's  Experimental  Cabaret this coming Monday, March 13th, at 7:00  PM:  I've never shown these in public, so it should be a good  grapple, including the short discusion on their origination.

I appreciate this response and the opportunity to re-read the Welcome =

attack.  I could not find

From time to time, we feel it is necessary to restate the policies of
this list. We ask all list participants to review the Welcome message,
which we include below.

Note that any correspondence sent to the Poetics List administration
account takes about ten days, for response; mail to this account is
checked about once per week.=20

We also want to reiterate one long-standing list policy:

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.=20

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons=20
New obstacles for exchange arise=20
Or unfold,=20
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list has
about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number of
nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site (see
archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in mind
the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one: in
most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the list,
and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv editorial
board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of discussion
that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the editorial
board will unsubscribe individuals if they are not, in our opinion,
productively contributing to the list or following our guidelines. We
remain committed to this editorial function as a defining element of the
Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.=20

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas.=20

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly to
the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in automatic
deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's =
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the
"from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.
Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post will be
unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu
this one-line message with no "subject": sub poetics [your Firstname and
Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email =
service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in
HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set
poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or digest
mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of time. Your
account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages as well as
other important mail. In such cases, switch your subscription to
"nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racial
slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than
their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work
is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list),
this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent
in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that you
get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.=20

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see

I'm looking for 20th century or current poets who have done work
employing traditional or traditional-ish Old English accentual,
alliterative verse.

I'm aware of a few attempts at individual poems - Ezra Pound's
translation of 'The Seafarer', WH Auden's 'The Wanderer' and *The Age
of Anxiety*, Richard Wilbur's 'Junk', CS Lewis' 'The Planets' - but
I'm looking for more sustained or recent attempts.

Anyone know of anyone who's doing or done this?

Thanks Murat.  I don't believe anyone suggested expulsion.  In fact, to =
borrow some of the imagery in Joel's post,  I was considering jumping over =
the cliff myself, or going no mail for a while.  I appreciate the policy =
articulated in the Welcome message nevertheless, and if the editors have =
acted on it in relation to Harry Nudel that's fine with me.  Whether the =
list is viewed as a performance or discussion space, I think care should =
be taken not to deliberately insult or offend. =20

I agree with what you say.  This discussion has certainly obliged me to =
look a little longer and harder at sentiments and images I consider =
repulsive. It has also made me a little more aware of the limitations of =
my own perspective. The limitations of my finding something repulsive. The =
limitations of my saying so. Also, I saw the repulsiveness of sexism far =
in advance of seeing the repulsiveness of racism, which obviously points =
to my own racism.  Paul's post reminded me that my easiest allegiance is =
to those with whom I most easily identify, i.e., Rachel Corrie over Edward =
Said and over all Palestinians whose names I do not know: an untenable =
position, maybe repulsive. =20

I also appreciate very much the more extended posts, and thoughtful =
writing.

I had not caught the initial posts which created all this controversy, so =

kept quiet. I for one have always read Nudel's posts. At least linguistical=
ly=20
they are among the most interesting. I am also an admirer of Mairead,=20
particularly her blog entries.

It seems we should be careful not to suggest expulsion everytime =
something=20
one doesn't like -or even one finds repulsive- is mentioned on this =
list.=20
Expulsion is like the nuclear option, best to be avoided at all costs.

Hmm. I'd like to point out that at no point did I or anyone else ask for
Harry to be thrown off the list. I said that as clearly as possible. What
was being asked, given the apparent lack of reaction from the listowners,
was whether misogyny and racism were acceptable on this list.  I see from
the List posting that racism is not acceptable, nor ad hominem attacks,
which is good to know; but there appears to be no policy on sexism. Is this
not an "issue" any more? If it isn't, why do sexual threat and sexual
humiliation so often colour the responses to outspoken women?

I do find it faintly ironical that this whole discussion was sparked by an
actual example of censorship - ie the on-going controversy about the NYTW's
decision to pull a play about Rachel Corrie. Harry himself seemed to think
that particular act of censorship was perfectly fine. Why aren't free speech
absolutists getting hot under the collar about the real issues, instead of
getting all touchy feely with their inner rapists?

Best

I would recommend Martin Davis's book that treats the life and work of the
mathematicians/logicians/philosophers who contributed to the development of
the computer. The name of the hardcover version is 'The Universal Computer:
The Road from Leibniz to Turing'. The name of the softcover version is
'Engines of Logic: Mathematicians and the Origin of the Computer'. Same
book.

It's a fascinating book concerning the lives, tribulations/pain and
achievement of

G.W. Leibniz
George Boole
Gottlob Frege
Georg Cantor
David Hilbert
Kurt Gödel
Alan Turing

We learn, for instance, that Leibniz had a day job. He was employed by the
Hanover family. And what did they employ him to do? To write the history of
the Hanover family. Leibniz, one of the great intellects of human history.
Sheesh. Cantor's work was spat upon by some very important mathematicians,
during Cantor's life, and he was in and out of sanitoria. And never did
receive a prestigious position. Gödel was a very curious character and
apparently suffered from paranoia. He starved himself to death, finally, out
of paranoia about his food being poisoned. And of course Turing, brilliant
as he was, and immense as his contribution to the WW II effort were, was
convicted in post-war Britain of homosexuality and ordered either to prison
or to take hormonal 'treatments'. He committed suicide by eating a poisoned
apple. He had chosen the 'treatments' and it may be that the drugs
contributed to an overwhelming depression...we aren't sure.

It's also an incredibly interesting book in 'the history of ideas' that
poets and people concerned with language will find intriguing. It traces the
computer from "Leibniz's dream" of a language of symbolic logic and a
machine capable of generating and manipulating propositions in that
language. And Martin Davis shows how that 'dream' progresses from Leibniz
through to Turing's work and the creation of the computer.

"Martin Davis, a distinguished logician, is also the author of
'Computability and Unsolvability', which has been called "one of the few
real lassis in computer science"." He is a professor emeritus at New York
University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and is a visiting
scholar at Berkeley.

One of my favorite biographies is of Jane Bowles, written by Millicent
Dillon.  It's sad, if you consider that she died alone in the desert after a stroke
that robbed her of language, while her husband, Paul Bowles, and their friends
were far away.  But it is also an interesting story and a good one about a
supposedly failed writer (as she was supposed to be).  If you have read her
fiction, then you know her sentences are divine, but that the stories "run out,"
just stop.  It seems she told herself and people told her that she didn't know
how to finish work she had started.  I give her a great deal of credit for
writing literary page turners that end with the reader whipping the last page
onto the next.

Cool to see Hettie X2...
and as to one of your other points, isn't that the challenge though,
to read a negative bio and still maintain one's love of a writer's work?

Greetings Papillae,

We are back in Boulder, recuperating from Austin and thought we'd
share some news:

*Carrington* by Elizabeth Robinson is finally out and ready for your
googly eyes. You can find more info and get yourself a copy by going
to Hot Whiskey Blog (www.hotwhiskeyblog.blogspot.com) or the Hot
Whiskey website (www.hotwhiskeypress.com/books.html).


*The Squalicum Harbor Suite* by Anselm Parlatore and *Hot Whiskey
Magazine #1* were also recently released if you haven't heard. More
info about them can be found at the above mentioned sites.


Other 2006 Hot Whiskey projects include *The Meat Book,* *Reciprocal
Distillations* by Clayton Eshleman (our first perfect-bound book), as
well as chapbooks from Anne Waldman, Stacy Szymaszek and Andrew
Peterson. Should be a few more announced as they are confirmed.

***

If you haven't heard, we were just given a letterpress, so more and
more of our projects will likely be printed on the ol Heidelberg...yet
to be named...if anybody's lookin' for broadside makers, drop us a
line. We're into it!

Thanks to all that visited our table at the Unassociated Garden Party.
We hope the hangover wasn't too bad.

yours,

Michael Koshkin & Jennifer Rogers

The second volume of Hilary Spurling's bio of Matisse--Henri Matisse-The =
Master. Given I don't 'believe in' the genre, and given that Spurling =
has no real understanding of modern art, I'm surprised this is such an =
interesting book. Actually it's about a household/studio/business. It's =
interesting for what you can do with it.

more stuff on the harassment in this town - defame and threaten even on
the street-- actually this rather large man with two dogs threatened me
earlier this week concerning this case -- that i should move out of town
and my dog would most likely be taken from me -- but what can i do?

a little guy against big people with hella scrill/money

then i think that people are losing their kids everyday to greater
injustices -- the ones myself and many other bruhs and sis from mmn to
kids on the street and those people imbedded are fighting everyday to
make theirs and our stories get heard.

i guess knowing that the people of iran might end up losing lives,
economy and scholars like palestine, like iraq, like the natives here
have and are still,like rachel corrie's parent's have --  it makes this
maybe not so important -- but it does hit
home and my heart.

maybe by saying this bothers me it will make it all not bother me so much.


as this wiser bruh once told me

sometimes you got to put a knife in your own heart to make you stronger.


i just don't know why, considering how ridiculous they feel i am and how
small a person in little town that i live in, i or what i do would be of
any importance.

Lawrence Yitzhak Braithwaite in Victoria Court
March 20, 2006 930 am
Hezbollah´s man in Victoria, BC has a date with a judge on Monday March
2oth 2006, ostensibly to challenge the constitutionality of Victoria
City´s animal control enforcement bylaws.

Apparently Mr. Braithwaite is receiving legal aid to mount this
challenge in response to receiving a $150.00 ticket for obstructing a
peace officer, namely Ian Fraser, the city dog catcher.

Will Yitz complain to the judge that this is happening because he´s been
singled out by a Jewish plot and the Israeli Mossad for punishment?

This should be great entertainment. Pack a lunch.

in a recent talk here, jonathan boyarin stressed the need to confront
our feelings about what he termed the "repugnant other," that is, the
person or position you feel it would sully your integrity and betray
your identity to empathize with.  It was powerfully put, and a
profound challenge.  I find the same kind of message from some
mahayana buddhist teachers' writings, and it is worth considering.
Corrie's death was shocking, but no more so than those of millions of
children who do not have access to the simplest health care basics:
one pill, for example, or one immunization shot.

I think Pound's use of AS alliteration in Canto I is more interesting.

Auden uses bits of Maldon in one of the earlyish poems, can't remember the
title off-hand.  IMHO _Anxiety_ is catastrophic, smelling of the lamp.

The Scottish poet Edwin Morgan has done this in translation -- most
obviously _Beowulf_ but also Wanderer, Seafarer, etc., available in his
collected translations.  I don't think there's much sign of it in his
original poetry, though.

The obvious (and undernoticed) writer would be Francis Berry -- "Morant
Bay", and _Ghosts of Greenland_ -- "Hvalsey" makes a good taster, if you
haven't come on his work.

Kazim Ali joins us in celebration of his first poetry collection, The Far
Mosque, just out from Alice James Books. Publishers? Weekly writes: ?
Painterly minimalism, open-field technique and Near Eastern traditions
together give Ali a neatly varied verbal palette for his smart, quietly
attractive poems.? Ali is also the author of a novel, Quinn?s Passage, and his
essays and poems have appeared in Five Fingers Review, Mirage #4/Period(ical),
The Iowa Review , and elsewhere. He teaches at Shippensburg University,
publishes Nightboat Books, and has a website at kazimali.com.

Ron Sukenick commented that ?Mark Wallace writes like John Hawkes dreaming of
Paul Bowles having a gothic nightmare.? Wallace?s books include the poetry
collections Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn?t There, Sonnets of a
Penny-A-Liner , and Temporary Worker Rides A Subway. His multi-genre work Haze
(Edge Books) appeared in 2004, as did his novel Dead Carnival (Avec Books). He
is coeditor of Telling It Slant: Avant Garde Poetics of the 1990s (University
of Alabama Press) and A Poetics of Criticism (Leave Books). Wallace currently
teaches at CSU San Marcos.

Thanks to everyone, these are great recommendations. I am going to enjoy
myself. By the way, have just finished Edgar Lee Master's bio of Whitman and
really liked that for portrait of Whitman and political/economic history.
Great timepiece as well.  thanks all! Michael

Jim,

In the same spirit there is the book (I don't remember the title) on the
creation of Oxford English Dictionary.

Michael, if it is not too heavy, I recommend Plutarch's Lives. One has the
eerie feeling of reading Shakespeare's notebooks.

i want to thank everyone for this very difficult, eye and heart opening
discussion.  i began to write and stopped several times the last few days
because there was so much to say, and i wanted to say it right.  in the
pause, just about everything i wanted to say was said by someone else,
including what you and mairead say in these posts, maria.  that made me
feel comfortble in this community, even though i stay shocked at some of
the plain old fashioned sexism and racism that came out.  i guess we're
part of the world, and i do not exclude myself from folks with blinkers.

A Tribute to Ronald Johnson
With Joel Bettridge, Barbara Cole, Joshua Corey,
Peter O'Leary, Jena Osman & Jonathan Skinner
Thursday, March 16, 7pm
Poets House, 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, NYC
Admission is $7 or free for Poets House members.

A celebration of the life and work of the poet Ronald Johnson (1935-1998),
the author of the metaphysical ARK, a book-length poem dedicated to "the
radiant structural beauty and mystery of the universe," in the words of
Robert Duncan.

Ronald Johnson was a visionary poet, allied with the Black Mountain School,
but his work was also rooted in the poetry of great visionaries like
Whitman, Blake, and Dante. His early poetry owes much to Charles Olson's
notions of projective verse, but he then immersed himself in the
international concrete poetry movement. His major project was ARK, the long
poem which he began in 1970 and finished twenty-one years later. Born in
1935, Johnson graduated from Columbia University in 1960 and traveled
extensively before settling in San Francisco. His poetry books include, A
Line Of Poetry , A Row Of Trees; The Book of the Green Men; ARK; and RADI
OS. He also had a parallel career as a chef and caterer and produced five
cookbooks on American regional cooking. He returned to live in Kansas
shortly before his death in 1998.

Presenters

Joel Bettridge co-edited a forthcoming collection of essays on Ronald
Johnson.

Barbara Cole is the author of an ongoing poetic project, which includes the
installments situ ation come dies and foxy moron.

Joshua Corey authored two collections: Fourier Series and Selah.

Peter O'Leary is a poet, teacher and editor of the literary journal LVNG.
The literary executor for Ronald Johnson, he edited two of Johnson's
posthumous publications.

Jena Osman is author of the poetry books The Character and An Essay in
Asterisks.

Jonathan Skinner edits ecopoetics and is the author of Political Cactus
Poems.

Thank you for this, Mairead and Maria.
Yes, I think to heave all this anger in anyone's direction is finally
counterproductive - tho it is hard to fight outrage as an immediate
corrective. I suspect the monitoring of someone with a history of making
gratuitous hurtful/hateful remarks is something the List Managers can and
maybe have done privately.
Though I do not feel a personal responsibility for the well being or health
of any list member who has gone 'off the hook', it would be much more to the
benefit of those who do, if they could be treated compassionately in a way
that would make one want to be a kind and/or reasonably critical member
here.

Poison sadly begets poison - is my experience.

Aaron, it's not a scam.  At least I hope it's not a scam since I have
a poem in the most recent anthology.  The editor accepted the poem
and 10 months later sent me an anthology.  I know a few other poets
in the anthology too.

Reb

p.s.  I owe you a "backchannel" (woo-hoo) -- later today, hopefully.

Can anyone suggest a poem/poems which talk in any way about the old NY world
fairgrounds in Queens, NY. Surely someone in the New York School might have
written about it.

I could go on and on about the clich=E9 buzz sort of book signing =
handshake
and who all famous I met at AWP and had a drink with or talked to at a =
party
but it won't take long it was Aaron Belz Aaron Belz was the most famous
person that I met he was handsome kind of unassuming and really made me
laugh Aaron Belz ate breakfast with me every day his insights were
delightful I kept noticing him wandering around the book exhibition and =
he'd
stop and talk to me and it was really nice of him but the big shocker =
was
when Aaron Belz took me out for veggie tacos and a little carriage ride =
we
stayed out into the night and skipped the big AWP reading I drank way =
too
much with him and then went to the bat bridge and stuff Aaron Belz took =
my
pants off and put them back on several times looked at me in the mirror =
even
winked Aaron Belz is cute but the way he looked at me I could tell that =
he
wanted to touch me in another way Aaron Belz signed his chapbook for me =
and
was smiling the whole time wrote something clever and now I have 30 =
copies
of it in my satchel he is so famous and I could go on and on and on=20

I am just back from AWP, where I was very consciously not checking my emails
very carefully and so I am only now reading back through this thread, and
while it seems awfully late and too "me-too-me-too-ish" to add anything at
this point, especially when so many people have said so many good things, I
do want to say that I too found what I have read so far of Harry Nudel's
comments appallingly racist and misogynist. (If I waited till I had the time
to read through the entire thread, it would be way too late for me to say
anything.)

I do, however, want to comment on Derek Rogerson's patronizing response to
Paul Catafago's statement about blocking Nudel's email, which I will quote
in full (Derek's response, that is):

>>There is something very wrong with going around "blocking emails"; having
a heart full of hate; censoring and seeking to destroy everything which
exists that doesn't fit into a comfortable vision; constantly "at war". This
won't do. We can't progress as anything if we constantly choose to go around
voting against each other, voting each other off-the-island, unwilling to
show any compassion for other beings. I know it's a very Judeo-Christian
thing to *blame* something, to make it pay, that without the blood sacrifice
nothing can move forward with completeness, but I think it's time to grow up
a little.<<

Someone's racism, sexism, anti-semitism, ageism, whatever-ism is *their*
problem and *their* responsibility, not the responsibility of the person at
whom those hatreds are directed. For someone who is the object of such
hatred-as Paul clearly is the object of Nudel's hatred of both the
Palestinians and the intellectual tradition(s) that attempts to advocate for
them-to choose not to listen to the person spewing forth such hatred is not
a matter of blaming or of Judeo-Christian blood sacrifice or of immaturity.
It is in many ways an entirely reasonable act of self-defense. More
importantly, though, it is also a way of throwing back onto the hater and
his or her community the fact of his or her own hatred, of holding that
community responsible for its own privilege and so on. Derek's flattening
out of these differences and of this dynamic is offensive.

There might conceivably be a time and a place where it would be worthwhile
for someone like Paul to hear to what someone like Harry Nudel has to say
about Edward Said, the Palestinians, the Israelis and so on, but, given the
way Nudel chooses to express himself on this list, not only in substance,
but also in a style that is very hard to decipher, much less respond to in a
logical fashion, it is clear to me at any rate that this list is not such a
place.

Calling All Publishers ::

I'm updating the Cuneiform Press homepage, including the links. If you know
of a small press publishing first edition works of "innovative" poetry that
does not already appear at: http://www.cuneiformpress.com/poe.html could you
please send me contact info? I'm particularly interested in handmade books,
but trade edition publishers are welcome.

Also, I would like to create an educational component for people interested
in starting their own small press operation. I'm looking for reputable:
PODs, Photopolymer Supplies, Paper Distribution, Digital (and metal) Type
Foundries, Centers for the Book, Independent Bookstores, Libraries as well
as books about books that would be useful to aspiring publishers (Clifford
Burke's Printing Poetry, Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style,
etc.).

With thanks,

it is not a scam, and I two poems in two different ones

it is a sort of every poem in a different font, many crowded onto a page
affair or at least it used to be, and "mwe" has the sort of "what is it"
editorial policy that leads to a lot of poems from slammers side by side
with a lot of very young poets

so it is not like sending to poetry.com, it is like sending to an 8 1/2 =

stapled publication that happens to be perfect bound and called an =
anthology

Seems to me the fair generated some poetry at the time. I'd check
Sandburg rather than the NY School, most of whom were still children
living in places far from New York--a distinguishing feature of the
New York School being, of course, that few of them were New Yorkers.
I wouldn't be surprised if there were references to the fair in
Reznikoff. Probably not much about the other fair in Queens, in 1964,
a pretty lack-luster affair. My job took me to that one twice--once
would have been more than enough.

Since biographies now includes autobiographies, I'd like to add: What Did I Do? by Larry Rivers, certainly one of the most sex-filled and entertaining bios or autobios I have ever read.  A real page-turner, to coin a cliche.

Hi folks,

thanks to Ken for posting the reading in Chapel Hill.

Eric Baus, Noah Eli Gordon, and myself (Joshua Marie
Wilkinson) are doing a little reading tour through
Georgia and North Carolina.  Please come out or tell
friends to come out.  Here's the goods:

Eric Baus is the author of The To Sound (Verse
Press/Winner of the Verse Prize) and several
chapbooks:  The Space Between Magnets (Diaeresis,
2001) and A Swarm In The Aperture (Margin to Margin),
Something Else The Music Was (Braincase Press) and the
forthcoming Tuned Droves (Katalanche). He has
published poems in Verse, Hambone, First Intensity,
Colorado Review, and other journals. He currently
lives in western Massachusetts.

Noah Eli Gordon is the author of The Frequencies
(Tougher Disguises), The Area of Sound Called the
Subtone (Sawtooth Prize/Ahsahta Press), and the
forthcoming A Fiddle Pulled From the Throat of a
Sparrow (New Issues / Green Rose Prize).  A new
collaborative chapbook, co-authored with Sara Veglahn,
was just released by Ugly Duckling Presse (and it's
amazing).

Joshua Marie Wilkinson is the author of Suspension of
a Secret in Abandoned Rooms(Pinball)--a book-length
poem that imagines a correspondence between
Wittgenstein and Schiele, and a new book length poem
that just came out this week called Lug Your Careless
Body out of the Careful Dusk (and won the Iowa Prize).
 New Michigan Press recently released an illustrated
chapbook called A Ghost as King of the Rabbits.  And
his first film, Made a Machine by Describing the
Landscape (a film about Califone) is due out this fall
with Thrill Jockey Records.

Wow. Got a lot of responses, both on-list and off-. I'm looking
forward to Heaney's *Beowulf* greatly, but want to get thru the
original, first. The other suggestions were all unknown to me, and
I've been having a fantastic time finding and reading them.

Thank you all very much.

Sorry if this is a repeat -- I haven't posted before, and it looked like
what I sent didn't go through -- so:

add to the list John Ashbery's "Finnish Rhapsody," in April Galleons.

Come to CHURCH

an art variety show

If I drew a cartoon of this country I would start by drawing a west coast in
a strip of beige rising up toward a green and dark brown mountain type area
then back down into a vast yellow mid section and then a green into gray
Eastern coast. Then I'd draw little bubbles floating up up up  toward one
big bubble in which would be the word, "OWNERSHIP." Then I'd stick a flag in
it and pop it.

Come to CHURCH and contemplate what's already on your mind!
Church is a reoccurring art variety show with a theme and the theme for this
sermon is "OWNERSHIP."

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

I Love Artists: New and Selected Poems

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing and lives in New Mexico. She is the author of nine volumes of poetry, including _Nest, The Four Year Old Girl,_ and _Empathy_.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Berssenbrugge



"A worthy introduction to her [Berssenbrugge's] elegant oeuvre."-_Publishers Weekly_

Drawing on four decades of work and including new poems published here for the first time, this selection of Mei-mei Berssenbrugge's poetry displays the extraordinary luminosity characteristic of her style-its delicate, meticulous observation, great scenic imagination, and unusual degree of comfort with states of indetermination, contingency, and flux.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Berssenbrugge

Alexander, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings so.

Yes, it's true, I do hate misogyny. (Racism and homophobia, too...) I don't
see how that's the same as hating men.

I told my children (two sons and a daughter) that I was being called a
man-hater and they all howled with laughter. They know their mama all too
well.

Cheers

A

What a bad argument!

First, they could have been laughing at you not with you -- they could know
you all too well and know that you were getting your just desserts, for
example.

Second, even if they were laughing with you at the notion of you being a
man-hater, who cares what your dependents think? They are your
dependents, after all. You control their lives, and what a risk they'd be
taking to disagree with you.

Third, once you bring up your children in this pro hominem way, you've
voluntarily reduced the argument to one about your character, not about
your opinions or views, and have no more ground to stand on if people
attack you or your character -- you've explicitly invited it.

Fourth, aside from the rhetorical flaws of your presentation, the argument
you're making "I have children, they are evidence that I've loved at least
one man" is itself bad. The examples of women who have had children
they didn't particularly want or expect are legion. That a woman has
children is no guarantee that she does not hate men -- the existence of
those children may be the reason she hates men, in fact.

Fifth, one may love a man but still hate men, or even humanity. That one
has fallen in love with one person, or even many people serially, or even
many people at once, is no guarantee of one's view of men in general or
humanity in general.  The notions of "falling in love with another person"
and "hating men (or women)" are different in kind, not in degree. Loving a
man (or woman) is no barrier to hating men (or women).

Sixth, all that doesn't add up to Alison hating men, however. She may leap
to unwarranted conclusions, and make bad arguments, and invite ad
hominem attacks thus subverting the principles of the forum, and all that,
without hating men. She is right that accusing her of hating men is itself
unwarranted and ad hominem.

But what a bad argument against another bad argument! What a bad case
Alison must have for whatever she believes if the best she can do against a
terrible argument is make a worse one.

Marcus

just as I was thinking I was delighted that one might bring up family
members on this list, and think that such people do provide us with a
glimpse of who we are, how we are. often, i think, it's the toughest look
we get from anyone. i've certainly never known my own family to hold their
disagreements back. thankfully they can laugh, too.

and I still think, bravo Alison!

Steve, are you forwarding to me a reminder that you are booked April 9 at the Back Fence or that I am or possibly both.  I don't remember scheduling this engagement for myself so please clarify.  It could be that I'm just misunderstanding "fwd".  Have a good day either way, Tom Savage

Alison,
I don't know you well enough to know your feelings on any subject.  I do =
know though that
one misdirected emotion's pretty much the same as all the =
others...misogynist, misandrist, no=20
real difference there. =20

What amused and amazed me was watching the "group think" unfold so =

Quite interesting, and a bit worrisome when one considers the =
occupations of many participants. =20

  Yes, it's true, I do hate misogyny. (Racism and homophobia, too...) I =

  I told my children (two sons and a daughter) that I was being called a

 >>PUB: open call for gender query
===============================

Dear activists and academics,

  I am pleased to announce the call for submissions to the upcoming
book, Gender Query: Explorations of Identity, Expression, and
Embodiment which will be published by Cambridge Scholars Press later
this year, or early 2007. The original concept of this book came out of
the amazing activism currently going on in Eastern Europe around the
areas of gender activism and LGBT human rights. The aim of this text is
to provide a cross-cultural and interesting look into various issues
surrounding gender.

  I am currently seeking proposals for academic papers relating to
gender variance and gender identity and/or expression. Gender variance
can include anything that you feel goes against the expectations of men
and women in a particular society. Papers need to be between 3,000 and
5,000 words and should address one or more of the following, in
relation to gender: trans issues, performance, linguistics, sexuality,
religion, or queer identity and culture. Proposals with an
international scope will make me very happy, but this is not a
requirement for publication. Additionally, please don?t feel that you
have to be well known or widely published to submit something.

  I am also looking for creative, preferably autobiographical,
submissions of 1,000 to 1,500 words also dealing with the topic of
gender variation. Although I am eager to receive proposals from anyone
who has something interesting to say, people from outside the US and
the UK are strongly encouraged to submit proposals.

This is an open call, please distribute widely.

  The proposal deadline has been extended to March 30, 2006. Proposals
should be no more than 500 words, please include your email address,
postal address, and telephone number.

Final submission deadline: June 15, 2006

  Please send proposals (and any questions you may have) to:
GenderQueryBook@yahoo.com

Sincerely,
Jakob Hero
Gender Query editor

No, Marcus, they were laughing _next_ to me.

Accusing a woman (or women - I'm sure I'm not the only one being swiped at
here) of hating men because she objects to posts about rape being the
woman's "responsibility", or about a woman's corpse being sexually abused,
is such a classic rhetorical twist that I'm almost amazed it happened. I
mean, wasn't there a provocation prior to those statements of concern? (And
what about the men who also objected to those posts?)

Nay, forsooth! said woman must be a ball-tearing, humourless, aggressive,
sexually frustrated witch with vagina dentata and a bad case of halitosis.
And that evil eye makes all phalluses shrivel to peanuts or disappear
altogether. Yah!

That's actually a very accurate description of me. I have no character to
defend. So watch it.

All best

A

Just because you make bad arguments doesn't make you a bad person.

Hey Alison,

I've been meaning to weigh in on Poetics (all 240 pounds of me like Kent =
Johnson!) but have just been so busy with the other lists.  It's hard to =
orchestrate everything.  Also with the bookstore campaigns.  I've been =
kinda busy on the homefront too.  We had to sell the penthouse because we =
weren't using it enough -- now we'll have to stay at the Four Seasons when =
we visit or somewhere.  Boring!  Anyway with all that & the 2 visiting =
prof gigs I'm really up to my  neck not to mention having Gramps visit & =
trying to interview nannies because if I don't get that sorted out I don't =
think I'll be able to make Switzerland in April.  I mean it's really hard =
to write poetry with all this going on.  I had to just scribble down a few =
lines in the orthodontists office the other day (at my age!  braces!  Oh =
well!  All that whitening deserves straight teeth Jules says!).  But =
seriously I hope these guys aren't getting you down.  What you need is a =
time on Bora-Bora like in '98.  Oh that reminds me of the boring Four =
Seasons again!  Do you remember that guy Guy??? I mean pul-eez! =20
But seriously I mean I got to write some poetry.  I have all these books =
coming out and nothing to put in them.  I mean do you think the blank book =
thing could work?  Has anyone done that recently??  It could be sort of =
post-avant couldn't it.  Like maybe I could do a Dugan thing with Poems 6 =
and Poems 7 etc only they'd all be blank.  I don't know if I have the =
chutz-pah (?).  Hey maybe you could write an essay or something, contextual=
izing the gesture, you know.  Anyway back to real life.  I've just read on =
Truthout:

    Washington - The bodies of more than 85 executed men have surfaced =
across Baghdad in the past two days, in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods, =
providing graphic proof, yet again, of sectarian mayhem.

    Many bodies bore marks of torture - badly beaten faces, gagged mouths =
and rope burns around the neck - though it remains unclear who is =
responsible.

Manhaters for sure.  I hope someone covered these bodies in kisses, at =
some time, before they were covered in mud, but what kind of people would =
do that: I mean, kiss a defenceless body?

No, Marcus, they were laughing _next_ to me.

Accusing a woman (or women - I'm sure I'm not the only one being swiped at
here) of hating men because she objects to posts about rape being the
woman's "responsibility", or about a woman's corpse being sexually abused,
is such a classic rhetorical twist that I'm almost amazed it happened. I
mean, wasn't there a provocation prior to those statements of concern? =
(And
what about the men who also objected to those posts?)

Nay, forsooth! said woman must be a ball-tearing, humourless, aggressive,
sexually frustrated witch with vagina dentata and a bad case of halitosis.
And that evil eye makes all phalluses shrivel to peanuts or disappear
altogether. Yah!

That's actually a very accurate description of me. I have no character to
defend. So watch it.

All best

A

There's a online petition by Human Rights First calling for a human rights
envoy to be appointed to Darfur

http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/international_justice/darfur/voices/index.as
px

Help Organize a Peace Envoy (H.O.P.E.) for Darfur

Join Human Rights First in the HOPE for Darfur Campaign to appoint a
prominent envoy to reenergize the diplomatic process in the Darfur region of
Sudan. The appointment of a high-level envoy will be a visible symbol of
renewed political and diplomatic will to resolve the Darfur crisis.

There is an urgent need to bring an end to the human rights emergency in
Darfur. In the last two months the security situation  has deteriorated
dramatically. United Nations personnel have withdrawn from parts of the
region because of increased violence, the humanitarian relief work of
international nongovernmental organizations has been greatly restricted, and
the civilian toll is again climbing.

A prominent envoy appointed with the support of the United Nations, in
cooperation with the United States and other key countries, is crucial to
bringing peace to the region.

Just having caught up on this thread, I give my full support to
Alison, Mairead, Amy and others.

It appears to me that Mr Nudel is baiting - is this *allowed on this list?

His misogyny sucks. If this was an attempt to create debate - and this
I doubt - it still sucks. I also concur with Randolph: going on a
march in the sixties doesn't give you carte blanch to do what you like
ever after.

In addition, I'd like to make it clear that I fully support the
Palestinian cause and view Rachel Corries death with sadness and
regret.

bless your heart, charles.  my thought exactly.

at risk of offering another bad argument--i wrote my dissertation
against just this kind of condescending snotty academic "logic."  how
colonial.  i fear it makes me boil, and that makes me susceptible to
straying from that o-so-desirable realm of pure rationality, where we can
exist without sullying ourselves.  and, worst of all, my laughter was in
danger of being doused.  gabe

"the life of a poetry professor is as familiar to ordinary americans as the

Hey Alison,

I've been meaning to weigh in on Poetics (all 240 pounds of me like Kent
Johnson!) but have just been so busy with the other lists.  It's hard to
orchestrate everything.  Also with the bookstore campaigns.  I've been kinda
busy on the homefront too.  We had to sell the penthouse because we weren't
using it enough -- now we'll have to stay at the Four Seasons when we visit
or somewhere.  Boring!  Anyway with all that & the 2 visiting prof gigs I'm
really up to my  neck not to mention having Gramps visit & trying to
interview nannies because if I don't get that sorted out I don't think I'll
be able to make Switzerland in April.  I mean it's really hard to write
poetry with all this going on.  I had to just scribble down a few lines in
the orthodontists office the other day (at my age!  braces!  Oh well!  All
that whitening deserves straight teeth Jules says!).  But seriously I hope
these guys aren't getting you down.  What you need is a time on Bora-Bora
like in '98.  Oh that reminds me of the boring Four Seasons again!  Do you
remember that guy Guy??? I mean pul-eez!
But seriously I mean I got to write some poetry.  I have all these books
coming out and nothing to put in them.  I mean do you think the blank book
thing could work?  Has anyone done that recently??  It could be sort of
post-avant couldn't it.  Like maybe I could do a Dugan thing with Poems 6
and Poems 7 etc only they'd all be blank.  I don't know if I have the
chutz-pah (?).  Hey maybe you could write an essay or something,
contextualizing the gesture, you know.  Anyway back to real life.  I've just
read on Truthout:

    Washington - The bodies of more than 85 executed men have surfaced
across Baghdad in the past two days, in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods,
providing graphic proof, yet again, of sectarian mayhem.

    Many bodies bore marks of torture - badly beaten faces, gagged mouths
and rope burns around the neck - though it remains unclear who is
responsible.

Manhaters for sure.  I hope someone covered these bodies in kisses, at some
time, before they were covered in mud, but what kind of people would do
that: I mean, kiss a defenceless body?

No, Marcus, they were laughing _next_ to me.

Accusing a woman (or women - I'm sure I'm not the only one being swiped at
here) of hating men because she objects to posts about rape being the
woman's "responsibility", or about a woman's corpse being sexually abused,
is such a classic rhetorical twist that I'm almost amazed it happened. I
mean, wasn't there a provocation prior to those statements of concern? (And
what about the men who also objected to those posts?)

Nay, forsooth! said woman must be a ball-tearing, humourless, aggressive,
sexually frustrated witch with vagina dentata and a bad case of halitosis.
And that evil eye makes all phalluses shrivel to peanuts or disappear
altogether. Yah!

That's actually a very accurate description of me. I have no character to
defend. So watch it.

All best

A

Mime-Version: 1.0

Today, March 16, is the third anniversary of the killing of Rachel Corrie.
Rachel was a nonviolent anti-occupation activist who put her body between a
home demolition bulldozer and a civilian doctor’s house in Gaza. Research
the facts and make your own decision whether she was murdered intentionally
or accidentally. I am not posting this message to debate the events on the
day of her death.

What is beyond dispute is that Corrie joined the International Solidarity
Movement (ISM) as an idealistic young woman outraged at the abuse and
mistreatment of everyday Palestinians. She didn’t just piss and moan to her
friends about global politics. She went to the other side of the world to
directly address the suffering of those she felt needed her most. Maybe you
think she was misguided. Some of you think she was stupid. That is
unimportant today.

Today, let's turn on that part of ourselves that is outraged at injustice,
wherever we see it occurring. And let's also remember that disparaging
statements about Corrie have been said about idealistic young people
throughout the years who have joined in struggles against oppression,
whether it be in South America, the American South or South Africa.

What has happened to us? Talking about a dead young woman the way some of us
have on this list is a disgrace. But I believe we are not beyond redemption.
Because March 16 is a day to shine that part of ourselves that still lives
to act for positive change.

If being moved to act against bullies and murderers in a nonviolent and
brave way is stupid, then this is a wish for stupidity to wash over this
list. May every book peddler, every scribe, every poet in Philadelphia or
Tel Aviv, take inspiration from the memory of Rachel Corrie- and become that
stupid.

i think a lot of the responses to the unfortunate and unintended
missive we've all been enjoying---well, some of it's been generous
and some of it's been cruel. i love you, ray, but reproducing that
post *again* is a not-friendly thing to do.

and unfortunately you've raised an issue implied by that unintended
missive, having to do with the relative material conditions of
academics, and you've done it in an unfortunate way. my own bank
account resides in a different solar system from the one suggested by
the misdirected post. i think that the bank accounts and expected
inheritances of most academics lies closer to my solar system than to
that one.

but since you raise the issue *in these terms*, ray, i love you, but
uh, how's *your* portfolio looking? huh ray? if you want to point
fingers in this way, babe, then hell, let's do it! bring it! my
(joe's and my) household 401(k) has precisely $90K in it, and i'm 15
years from what "ordinarary americans" would call "retirement." my
assets total about $15K.

no inheritances in our future.

you?

love, and you know i mean that seriously, ray,
kass

as a ps, since this has nothing to do with ray: these anti-feminist
diatribes are bullshit.

When I was on this list c2001 there was a lot of discussion of poetry and
poetics, and not so much self-advertisement (but if you can't beat em join
em, I just landed on Ron Silliman's blogroll!) and misdirected anger.

I think that Pam Rehm doesn't publish enough. Her new(ish) book is so huge
with empty meaning (not meant in the usual pejorative sense) that I find it
hard to make my bed in the morning.

Hi poetix,

I am sending this on behalf of my wife Cara who is a textile artist. She
currently has a show up and the response has been fantastic. I encourage
you all to check out the images on her blog.

But, this post is more than shameless plug for the missus. Her next
project will be based on responses she gets to the little questionaire
below that asks women about their relationship with their bodies.

For more information have a look at www.carawinsorhehir.blogspot.com

bests,
kevin

Talk Therapy - Questionnaire

I'm doing the prep work for my next body of work.
Please have a look at the questionnaire and complete what ever parts you
are comfortable with. Copy questionnaire. Paste into comments, email, or
word file. Address below.

Questionnaire

Talk Therapy
a quilt of shapely nudes and their stories

I am proposing to create an exhibit that will express how women feel about
their bodies. I will write a series of short essays and craft mixed medium
works to accompany each essay.

I will interview women, through questionnaires, of all different body
types, and arrange discussion groups, both in person and online, where
women can gather to discuss weight, self esteem and other female issues,
and hopefully have some fun.

*please answer any questions that you feel comfortable with, however brief
or detailed as you wish, and return to craftymissus@hotmail.com.
Need more space for your answers? Feel free to add extra pages.

Name:

Contact information:

Age:

Description of appearance:

Please rate how you feel about your body (Positive=1 Negative=5):

Does your appearance affect choices you make in your life? (pls explain)

Have you ever had negative &/or postive encounters based on your
appearance? (pls explain)

When do you feel most beautiful?

Would you be interested in:

__ modeling
__ taking part in a discussion group to further explore this topic (St.
Johns area, blogsite)
__ receiving other questionnaires and/or updates of the progress of this
project

I was joking as well, wow Kass, and I respect you as well....

I did not think that a post that included Bora Bora, penthouses and the Four
Seasons was serious?! Or was it?
Others on the list made similar jokes.... But I guess that I am not allowed
to make any jokes at all or see the irony?

Regarding solar systems and money I do think that academics and teachers
should make more money. I use my resources to donate to candidates who
believe the same.

As for my personal commitments, I worked in Latin America for four years of
my life for free as a volunteer and forgoed graduate school or work to do
this.

Then after working in Latin America I worked 70 hour weeks in business
publishing while being an active member of the poetry community and doing
volunteer work as well. I do not apologize for my life or my experiences to
anyone.

Having said this you are correct that my repeating a quote may not be
not-friendly but I did not mean to be cruel to anyone.

I unlike other posters here will apologize to whomever was hurt by my post.

ray bianchi wrote, quoting *himself* in another context, i believe:

i think a lot of the responses to the unfortunate and unintended missive
we've all been enjoying---well, some of it's been generous and some of it's
been cruel. i love you, ray, but reproducing that post *again* is a
not-friendly thing to do.

and unfortunately you've raised an issue implied by that unintended missive,
having to do with the relative material conditions of academics, and you've
done it in an unfortunate way. my own bank account resides in a different
solar system from the one suggested by the misdirected post. i think that
the bank accounts and expected inheritances of most academics lies closer to
my solar system than to that one.

but since you raise the issue *in these terms*, ray, i love you, but uh,
how's *your* portfolio looking? huh ray? if you want to point fingers in
this way, babe, then hell, let's do it! bring it! my (joe's and my)
household 401(k) has precisely $90K in it, and i'm 15 years from what
"ordinarary americans" would call "retirement." my assets total about $15K.

no inheritances in our future.

you?

love, and you know i mean that seriously, ray, kass

as a ps, since this has nothing to do with ray: these anti-feminist
diatribes are bullshit.

Hello, everyone.

It's time for another call for poems for WSQ (formerly Women's Studies
Quarterly, published by the Feminist Press). The theme for this issue is The Sexual
Body. Meaning, in context, the female sexual body.

You may send your takes to me at ossipk@aol.com. Please paste the poems into
the email and include all contact info. Previously UNpublished only. I'm happy
to have included Buffalo listers in the last   issue. Deadline is May 1.

Happy spring,
Kathy Ossip

I know this questionnaire is directed at women, but it would curious, and
maybe oddly and/or sweetly revelatory to have it aimed at (us) men.
The mischief maker here wonders how the men who have been recently labeled
as "misogynist" might respond to these queries.
Most men I know started - and eventually stopped - measuring just one thing
about age 11 or 12 and sharing (or not) that information most everywhere
within immediate male circles.
But the larger questions here are maybe still probably off the charts among
our species. I mean can you imagine George Bush or Dick Cheney providing
answer to:
> Have you ever had negative &/or positive encounters based on your
> appearance? (pls explain)
Or
> When do you feel most beautiful?

That last one I would certainly like to know.

Just thinking,

That's right, PR. Keep lighting candles- dozens & dozens more for everyone
you've mentioned.

The notion that the Rachel Corrie killing got anywhere near the kind of
media attention the Laci Peterson case did is absurd.

But fuel on, friend. Anger is an energy.

Note: I didn't mean to equate the coverage of Corrie's death with the media
circus that was the Peterson case. I only brought up Laci to point out that,
as  a culture, we tend to be overly sympathetic and concerned with characters
who  fit certain molds.

cris, actually, that some of us didn't catch that mairead (whom i've
never met, but have corresponded with off and on for some years) was
joking probably *does* support the view, however occasionally
paranoid, that the disparities among academic/knowledge workers are
indeed very real...

which is to say, i've known academics who live pretty much in the
terms mairead was busy lampooning... and interestingly enough, not
b/c of their academic salaries, but b/c of their family backgrounds
and such...

a different kind of reality, that is, than the one you'll likely find
in other industries...

best,

I don't think anyone would say that remembering one person who happens to be a white woman means we aren't shocked and sad (I know these words are inadequate) for so many others who suffer and who don't have the same notoriety. Just because I mourn for one person doesn't mean I do it at the exclusion of others, or that I think less of their suffering.

And no one, including Rachel Corrie, asks to be born "privileged," though it sounds like being born an "American white chick" is in itself a moral shortcoming. I admire her for trying to do something rather than playing it safe and doing nothing. She didn't have to try, but she did try.

Do some people assume that Rachel Corrie's motives were selfish and self-aggrandizing? That is what it sounds like.

I'm sure (or afraid) that there are holes in my argument that others will see as moral incompetence. And if I've unknowingly said something offensive here, I apologize. I know that I couldn't possibly understand what life is like for Palestinians and I don't even pretend to understand that kind of suffering. But does that mean we should rail against someone who tries to make a difference, simply because of the life they were born into?

A friend of mine that worked as a Palestinian humanitarian did say there were some people who treated the trip like a danger vacation. But I don't think that is the motive for all. And I can't imagine that was Rachel Corrie's motive. At any rate, she's dead and I think it's bad form to disrespect someone who's died in an awful way and who is mourned by those who love her. Was she so awful a person that she deserves being vilified in death?

For every one candle  you set-up for Corrie, light a dozen more for Joe &

poor mairead, misread in her spoof, but such interesting territory as

i haven't seen a dollar sign since my own post (and joe's post from

oh yeah, it was much worse pre-bankruptcy), all (all) incurred from
unreimbursed professional expenses -- the things my school insists

Kass and all:

$  (there's a dollar sign for ya)

I won't be as explicit with numbers here, 'cause you just don't know who might
be reading -- suffice it to say that you have mentioned another aspect of the
academic profession that remains invisible to the public at large (who think we
"have the summers off" and that we only work nine hours a week) --

I'm still paying off the debts I built up during the many years I was at a
university that had no support to speak of for travel & research.  I'm in a
considerably better situation now, but it will be years more before I get it
all paid off.  No, nobody forced me to go to those conferences -- but by the
same token, I was expected to be "professionally active" -- and at least one of
my book projects came about as a direct result of a conference trip --

In much the same way that public school teachers are now simply expected to buy
school supplies out of their own money (ya see those STAPLES commercials about
the teacher buying her stuff?), Professors at universities with dwindling
research support have to take up the slack on their own, or just dwindle right
along with the support.

The first job campus visit I ever went on, the university didn't even pay all my
travel bills!

A Tribute to Ronald Johnson
with Joel Bettridge, Barbara Cole, Joshua Corey, Peter O'Leary, Jena Osman =
&
Jonathan Skinner=20

Poets House, 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, NYC
Admission is $7 or free for Poets House members.

A celebration of the life and work of the poet Ronald Johnson (1935-1998),
the author of the metaphysical ARK, a book-length poem dedicated to =B3the
radiant structural beauty and mystery of the universe,=B2 in the words of
Robert Duncan.=20

Ronald Johnson was a visionary poet, allied with the Black Mountain School,
but his work was also rooted in the poetry of great visionaries like
Whitman, Blake, and Dante. His early poetry owes much to Charles Olson's
notions of projective verse, but he then immersed himself in the
international concrete poetry movement. His major project was ARK, the long
poem which he began in 1970 and finished twenty-one years later. Born in
1935, Johnson graduated from Columbia University in 1960 and traveled
extensively before settling in San Francisco. His poetry books include, A
Line Of Poetry , A Row Of Trees; The Book of the Green Men; ARK; and RADI
OS. He also had a parallel career as a chef and caterer and produced five
cookbooks on American regional cooking. He returned to live in Kansas
shortly before his death in 1998.

Presenters: Joel Bettridge co-edited a forthcoming collection of essays on
Ronald Johnson. Barbara Cole is the author of an ongoing poetic project,
which includes the installments situ ation come dies and foxy moron. Joshua
Corey authored two collections: Fourier Series and Selah. Peter O'Leary is =
a
poet, teacher and editor of the literary journal LVNG. The literary executo=
r
for Ronald Johnson, he edited two of Johnson's posthumous publications. Jen=
a
Osman is author of the poetry books The Character and An Essay in Asterisks=

Poems.

Subject: A Candle for Rachel Corrie

   Today, March 16, is the third anniversary of the killing of Rachel
Corrie. Rachel was a nonviolent anti-occupation activist who put her
body between a home demolition bulldozer and a civilian doctor?s house
in Gaza. Research the facts and make your own decision whether she was
murdered intentionally or accidentally. I am not posting this message
to debate the events on the day of her death.

  What is beyond dispute is that Corrie joined the International
Solidarity Movement (ISM) as an idealistic young woman outraged at the
abuse and mistreatment of everyday Palestinians. She didn?t just piss
and moan to her friends about global politics. She went to the other
side of the world to directly address the suffering of those she felt
needed her most. Maybe you think she was misguided. Some of you think
she was stupid. That is unimportant today.

  Today, let's turn on that part of ourselves that is outraged at
injustice, wherever we see it occurring. And let's also remember that
disparaging statements about Corrie have been said about idealistic
young people throughout the years who have joined in struggles against
oppression, whether it be in South America, the American South or South
Africa.

  What has happened to us? Talking about a dead young woman the way some
of us have on this list is a disgrace. But I believe we are not beyond
redemption. Because March 16 is a day to shine that part of ourselves
that still lives to act for positive change.

  If being moved to act against bullies and murderers in a nonviolent
and brave way is stupid, then this is a wish for stupidity to wash over
this list. May every book peddler, every scribe, every poet in
Philadelphia or Tel Aviv, take inspiration from the memory of Rachel
Corrie- and become that stupid.

Kevin,

No,  clearly I didn't know Laci Peterson. And you miss my point entirely.
Laci Peterson was brutally murdered, as was her unborn child. That's a
tragedy
thru and thru. What was ridiculous about the situation was the  media
coverage.
As troubling as murder can be, it's hardly a national  story, and it
certainly
doesn't merit around the clock news coverage.

Think about it. If Laci Peterson had been a poor black woman from, say,  the
Detroit ghetto, do you really think that the volume and intensity  of
coverage
would have been nearly the same? Would cable news have  hosted a parade of
friends, family, and "experts" to get to the bottom  of the case? Was it
journalism, or was it something else? The perfect  drama to appeal to the
soap  opera
sensibilities of millions of  Americans.

Similarly, re: Corrie, you rarely hear so much weeping  and  gnashing of
teeth
over youn Palestinian women who are killed  in  Israeli raids, missile
attacks, and protest busts.  The story  was  blown up and strangely exploited
(by both
the right and the  left).  I  wish nothing ill against her -- RIP &c.. But
her
sacrifice strikes  me as neither noble nor productive; her talents and
passion could have been  put to such better use. There seems to just be
something
about the  idea of this righteous little American girl being  run  down (very
possibly by accident) that is so offensive that it  stirs us to  call for a
vigil.


Respect is one  thing. Obsession and hero-worship are quite  another.

I Reply:

I think the first couple responses to Mairead's post could feel her tone...
but you're right, to add the "mortified" really took it to a tonally obscure
place. I was sure it was the wonderful punch line to a rather glorious
little prose piece (that book about all these books that need to be filled
was pure bliss), but I was rather afraid to suggest that on the bizarre
chance Mairead could have really meant it.

What I find really amazing, though, is how listserves allow for, and
encourage, us away from critical thinking, subtelty, and all those wonderful
things that we wish there were more of in general. This is a listserve of
mostly poets, so where is that spirit of language? That antic production
that's supposed to make us better language users? All that stuff I've read
over the years about what we think poetry does in society... can do in
society... in the face of power and the facile uses of language by those in
power doesn't seem to be our primary response to things (and by "our" I also
mean "mine" as I have plenty knee-jerk reactions as well).

Of course, I could be wrong. At least that's what the voices tell me.

Mr. Primeau,

  As a Palestinian, the last words on your last post, Re: A Candle for Rachel Corrie, struck me:
  There seems to just be something about the  idea of this righteous little American girl being  run  down (very possibly by accident) that is so offensive that it  stirs us to call for a vigil.

Do you have any evidence that she was killed accidently? You diminishing Rachel Corrie's death as an accident misses the point. Even if the bulldozer operator had no intent to kill Ms. Corrie, the fact that he was there illegally razing a Palestinian home under an illegal occupation made him culpable. (my use of the word illegal here is based on international law, and the recognition that, under that law, the 39 year occupation of Gaza- where Ms. Corrie was killed- is illegal.)

  The equivelent in this country is someone dying accidently during the commission of a felony: It's still considered, legally, murder.

  I whole heartedly agree (I mean obviously) that Rachel Corrie has been used by both left and right- and that there are countless Palestinian women whose names few know who have died under the same circumstances as Miss Corrie.

  However when you challenge the circumstances of her death- when you intimate that somehow it was just an innocent mistake, an accident, I would say that the occupation of Palestinian lands is not an accident, that the systematic imprisonments and assasinations of Palestinians, are not accidents.

  I have my own theories about why Rachel Corrie has compelled people so much- here I would refer you to the writings of Frantz Fanon regarding skin color, pychology and power. Very simply I think it's easier for people to iconize a girl that could have been their sister, etc, than to honestly embrace the face of the other.

  In any case, that's all I wanted to say,

  Be well

Indeed, that is the problem with voices. And they're notoriously bad with
things like bus fare, as well.

PR-

Have you ever mentioned a young Palestinian woman on this list who gave her
life resisting the occupation? I'll have to go the archives on this one, but
I don't remember a post like that.

I agree with Paul's take on Fanon as it relates to this conversation.  Know
that his point is the basis for the work that organizations like the ISM and
Voices in the Wilderness do. The Palestinian people of Gaza & the West Bank
are treated as invisibles by the west, and people like Rachel Corrie go to
the occupied territories to bear witness and use their western privelege as
leverage against the abuses of occupation forces. The fact that you PR,
don't like that she had western privelege, is no reason to minimize her
death.

It seems you cannot respect someone who could have lived her privelege in
Washington state without the scorn of you & so many others, but chose
something different. Maybe it wasn't effective for you. She could have used
her passion & talent in more productive ways. Maybe she would have been a
naysayer on the Buffalo List today if she'd have stayed in Olympia!

If anything, her case is a lesson on the limits of leveraging western
privelege when it comes to US/Israel policy. It appears the human interest
story of the "little American girl" did not play well in Washington DC, as
the flimsy accounts of the IDF were accepted without question.

I will tell you where the story does play well. In Gaza, many Palestinians
remember Rachel Corrie as one of the few Americans who gave their lives to
stand with the occupied people of Palestine.

btw- the "accidental" shooting of British ISM activist (& friend of Corrie)
Tom Hurndall was also reported by the IDF. Hurndall was shot in the head &
killed just days after the "accidental" bulldozing of Rachel Corrie. Western
privelege has more pull in the Britain apparently, as Foreign Secretary Jack
Straw demanded the IDF open an inquiry into the murder. Ultimately, IDF
Sergeant Taysir al-Heib was convicted of manslaughter.

ARRANGING NATURE

words to stone, syntax to landscape, and thus through language make matter=

matter. It is a considerable accomplishment.
                 =97 Michael Davidson


BLACK VALENTINE

POETRY

In Black Valentine, "The unspeakable / is incorporated here / by reference"=

Yes, I suspect there is some odd "purity" principle among some that would
forbid the oppositional or revolutionary participation of anyone who is not
- in this case - a pure Palestinian. I don't there has ever been a
successful movement (resistant &/or revolutionary) that did not pull part o=
f
its membership, even a partial leadership role from 'the ruling class'. The
French revolution - one of the bourgeoisie - certainly benefited from the
participation of rebellious nobles; the Civil Rights Movement from
participation from whites, etc., etc.  There is, of course, a history of
upper-class folks participating and screwing things up 'royally' - take the
Weathermen, and/or the folks who joined up with Cinque and the SLA. They
caused much counter-revolutionary damage.

The discussion here would not have been so likely to take place if Rachel
Corrie had not been murdered. If her death does not make one look beyond th=
e
fanzine quality that some want to appoint to it, and, instead, provide a
means to further insight into the oppressive madness that informs most any
military occupation, I think that=B9s more a reflection on those who want to
stay focused on Corrie, rather than the issues for which, at least in
America, her death, sadly, has been a catalyst.

Robert Adamson, one of the best Australian poets,  gave a wonderful reading
at SF State U Poetry Center yesterday. For him it was debut reading in
America, conjoined with the release of his Goldfinches of Baghdad - a very
nicely produced volume  from Flood Editions - and, I find, a delightful
book, full of seeming magical turns and surprises.
Adamson described how - since the early seventies - he had been in
correspondence with Duncan, Tom Raworth, Creeley, M Palmer et al. However
this is his first visit here - in fact, he will meet Raworth for the first
time when they read together soon in Boulder.

Anyway, if his extensive reading tour - on the Flood website - brings him
close by, I heartily recommend.

[i wrote this article last year for our local indy paper about a large
protest in chicago commemorating the invasion of iraq. i urge everyone
who can to join the protest nearest them tomorrow]


Report: March 19 2005 Anti-War Protest in Chicago

On the morning of Saturday March 19th, fifteen members of the
Bloomington-Normal Citizens for Peace and Justice piled into four large
domestic cars in the parking lot of the Unitarian Church in Bloomington
and drove two hours north to join about 1,000 other protestors in a
march that began outside the famous Newberry Library on Dearborn and
proceeded through the crisp and swank Gold Coast district, across the
Chicago River, and into the Federal Plaza at Adams and Dearborn, where
Jesse Jackson, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, Faridah Havandi, Lila Lipscomb
(the mother from Flint, Michigan, in Fahrenheit 9/11) and many others spoke.

Our delegation joined a pre-march rally outside the Newberry Library
organized by the Chicago Coalition Against War and Racism. When our
party arrived at the Ruth Page Park on Dearborn, there were several
hundred protestors having A REALLY GOOD TIME. The air was thick with
cigarette smoke and the cacophonic stylings of a madcap brass band
called The All-American Anti-War Marching Band.

The march, however, didn’t start right away. Organizers had to negotiate
with the police about our route. Fearing people were growing impatient,
an earnest bald man bearing an official air explained into a megaphone
within earshot of police officers that careful negotiations were being
undertaken with the law. Then he shouted, “Just give us a few more
minutes to hash this out with the pigs!”It was clear by his sincere
demeanor that that he did not use term with irony. I’m sure this did not
enamor him, or his cause, to the police. But it was very funny.

While we waited for the march to start, some members of the BNCPJ
unfurled and manned our impressive banner announcing the presence and
support of the citizens of Bloomington-Normal. I wandered around
examining the uniforms and haircuts of the police officers.

There were three bodies of police in attendance: Illinois State
Troopers, who looked frightened and ready to club someone; Chicago
municipal police, who looked bored and mean; and the Cook County
Sheriff’s Police, about whom I grew quietly fond because they had kind
faces -- and many of them were slouching and smoking, and a few even had
full beards! I liked this particular class of police very much! But the
other class of police, the city and state class, these police were menacing.

The state troopers were decked in all black riot gear with small funny
kevlar shoulder pads and fussy special gloves and black flappy shin pads
of strange design. They wore matching black boots. They wore these icky
black vests with little rectangles of black foam on them. They carried
huge blond clubs made of ash, three feet long and as thick as a child’s
ankle. Their helmets were a pretty blue though -- and they each got a
sparkly Lucite visor to protect their faces. Some of their visors were
up and some of them were down. The ones whose visors were down looked
frightened and seemed to breathe harder than the other ones. Despite how
simultaneously awkward and menacing they looked, I was acutely happy
nobody was taunting the police or saying mean things to them. I have
been at demonstrations where ignorant protestors do this sort of thing
and I find it repellant and abusive: I have no illusions about the
structural function and socialization of police, but these are often
just generous people at heart who’ve chosen a line of work that brings
them to a protest or two. We should treat them with decency and
generosity even if they have no idea that they are alienated and
alienating dupes of the state. I do not like it when demonstrators say
mean things to police. There was one sizeable mean policeman who wore a
fluorescent piss-yellow cod piece and his badge read “Lt. Lucy Laverne.”
That last sentence was a joke.

There were crocuses coming up in the Ruth Page Place park. Dancing next
to the crocuses was the above mentioned ardent group of 30 musicians
bedecked in red tops. There was a trombonist, a bugler, a tall man in a
dented tuba, a thin hyperactive man with a snare drum, and some random
brass circling under the trees -- and several dancers waving
coffee-table-sized green flags like they were signaling everyone with a
kind of semaphore. A beautiful woman with very small breasts was doing
cartwheels in a low cut red top up and down the line of dancers. I
watched them a long time. Then I had a conversation with an earnest
woman about the difference between Trotskyites and Trostkyists.

As we waited for the organizers to work our route out with “the pigs,”
we chatted and wandered around. It was in my wandering that I discovered
that this huge, clattering collection of protestors was massed in front
of a quiet and unassuming library. And not just any library: this was
the Newberry Library.

“The Newberry,” as it is fondly known, sits in an unpretentious brick
building across the street from the little park at Ruth Page Place on
Dearborn and Walton, and it is one of the great independent research
libraries in the world, housing several world-famous collections of rare
books and maps and pamphlets whose cumulative age would stretch back if
not to the Devonian then at least to that recent era when the first Bush
patriarch decided to leave his Neanderthal brethren and try his hand at
the Cro-Magnon thing.

Inside that quiet library, far back in vaults and inside a special
distant room, is a pamphlet, printed January 10th, 1776. The pamphlet,
called “Common Sense” and written by the great Quaker activist Thomas
Paine, is in delicate condition. It was written by Paine to urge the
lethargic American people to declare their independence from the British
crown and its soldiers: It was his pamphlet, some feel, that changed the
minds of Jefferson, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin, all of
whom had, prior to reading it, supported the crown. In any case, in that
document, which I have studied, Paine wrote, “The Continent hath, at
this time, the largest body of armed and disciplined men of any power
under Heaven.”

And, as if to prove the above were still true, 15 mounted police
officers on great brown mares stood directly in front of the Newberry’s
steps. At first I couldn’t figure out why there were great puddles under
the horses. Then I realized those were huge puddles of urine. Then I saw
the little clots of brown putty on the street under the horse tails. I
also noted the light gray and white scuff marks made in the macadam by
their steel shoes.

The horses, which looked very cute and preoccupied, also had little
sparkly visors over their eyes. Despite the cacophony and the jiggling
and shouting and bouncing and the waving of signs in their faces the
horses stood impassive and seemed to be very patient with us all. Some
of the signs read:

Draft the Bush Twins

Smoke Weed, Not Iraq

Then from a megaphone: “Exxon, Mobil, BP, Shell: Take this war and go to
hell!”

Some other signs:

Send Jenna and Barbara

More Trees: Less Bush

Then from a megaphone: “The word/ united,/ will never be defeated!// The
students/ united/ will never be defeated!”

And a sign:
Let’s Bomb Texas: They Have Oil Too

And again from another megaphone:

“George Bush!/ We! know! you!// Daddy was a/ killer too!”

And out of another megaphone:

“Arab, Jew, Black and White: Workers of the world unite!”

There were competing megaphones: “The cops, the courts, the Nazis and
the Klan: Are all a part of the Wall Street plan!”

And my personal favorite of all the signs:
USA: Fighting Terrorists since 1492

Then finally news came that the negotiation with the police had failed
and that we would not be able to walk along the route we had planned.
The leader with the PA system on his bald head shouted into the
bullhorn, “It’s a free country and we get to do whatever the police tell
us!”

So we finally got moving, but the police split our contingent into two
groups: one down Dearborn and the other down Clark. We both walked, one
block apart, south a dozen blocks through the most conservative heart of
downtown Chicago to the Federal Plaza. We were quite a sight -- and you
could probably hear us from the top of the Sears Tower. We walked
through the Gold Coast canyons in a gamelan of competing bullhorns and
airhorns, as if we were a bizarre many-headed emotional klezmer dragon
wading through the multi-directional echoes of the turbines and rotors
of the helicopters circling overhead, police sirens, cars honking,
boomboxes on bicycles blaring political music, and every tenth man with
a bullhorn shouting something in Spanish or about the toxicity of diaper
use, and lanky young men running about with snare drums and roaring
about the war. It was a lot of fun!

And even at one point in the Gold Coast a well-dressed nicely coiffured
white man opening his VERY LARGE apartment window and shouting feebly
into the din and laughter: “The wars stop the dictators! The wars stop
the dictators!” The few people who were paying attention to his ranting
just pointed at him with their mouths open.

I took notes with a semi-vintage Parker 45 fountain pen (medium nib)
that I had purchased the week prior from ISU Professor Emeritus Carrol
Cox. I had loaded the pen that morning with Noodler’s Black ink -- a
fast drying superdark permanent ink with very low feathering qualities
so that I could write on some sheets of cheap light blue foolscap paper
folded in half.

When we got to the Federal Plaza at 2pm, we were met by three or four
other “feeder” marches, some of them organized by the International
Solidarity Movement and the Palestine Solidarity Group. As I arrived I
noticed Jesse Jackson was on the stage and had apparently just given a
speech. Then Fariba Murray reported to me that she saw the following
sign (and I ran off desperately looking for it):

For the Love of God
Won’t Someone Cockslap Bush

The speeches by Cynthia McKinney, Faridah Havandi, Lila Lipscomb were
overwhelming in their emotional impact. And that Faridah Havandi can
really belt it out there; I think she has three or four donkey lungs: I
saw some in the crowd plugging their ears she was so loud. Dazed by
Havandi’s oratory, I wandered around during one speech looking at faces
and haircuts, and I saw a family holding signs that read, “Juan Manuel
Torres: 2-7-79 7-12-04” “In Memory of My Son: Murdered by the Army -
Bagram, Afghanistan.” The signs also held large photographs of a deeply
intelligent looking and kind-faced young man in dress greens. I
approached the woman and asked her if she was his mother. She said she
wasn’t but that she was his mother’s friend and that she had seen him
grow up from a baby. I burst out crying for some reason and thanked her
for coming. Embarrassed by that, I walked over to a table of pamphlets
where I soon found myself in a conversation with a woman who wanted to
know how anyone in his right mind could choose an Anarcho-Syndicalist
worldview over a Marxist one. I told her I thought Anarchists were nicer
and that I didn’t know much about them beyond that, but I bought a
little booklet from her for $2 and promised to read up on the
differences between Marxism and Anarchism. She seemed satisfied with
that and we shook hands. I liked her face.

When I found Mollie Monroe, Faridah Havandi, and Fariba Murray again, in
the soup of heads and jiggling signs, we all sat down behind the
makeshift stage and the echoing racks of speakers and just enjoyed each
other’s presence while listening to the speeches and watching the benign
confusion of the people and occasionally making jokes about the pretty
helmets of the police. And at one point Fariba became quite upset while
remembering how the mounted police used the horses to push against the
people as they got bottlenecked at a certain moment when entering the
plaza from Adams. “They pushed us out of the way with horses and shouted
at us. We are living in a police state!” And, really, none of us, I
think, would have disagreed with her.

As we left the ringing Plaza around mid-afternoon there were still many
people slated to talk, and a band was going to sing, but we were getting
cold and Fariba promised to take us to a nummy Iranian restaurant called
Reza’s. Before we got to the final cordon of police surrounding us, we
passed two young men in business suits. One man gave me his business
card that read, “50% OFF: Mobile Protest Area (for 30 minutes, $5 for
additional 30 minutes): EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AT 1/2 THE
COST: FREE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT PICKET SIGN RENTAL WITH THIS COUPON (or $3
for 30 minutes) -- Kids in FREE with Paying Adult -- [then in very small
font] -- brought to you by Clear Channel.” Then the other one produced a
black box and pointed it at my head and took a Polaroid of my face and
held it out to me shouting: “Commemorate your time here at this
anti-establishment protest! Yours for only 8 dollars!”

I laughed very hard for a second and grew really happy and thanked them
and told them there was no fucking way I was going to give them 8 bucks
for a face I could see for free in my rearview and I asked if I could
simply have the picture instead. But like the good capitalists they were
parodying, they refused. Their inventiveness made me very happy and I
ran ahead to catch up with Fariba and Fati and Mollie to tell them about
the genius men in suits behind us and thinking about that phrase from
“Common Sense,” only 13 blocks to the north, the really cool one where
Paine just busts out and says, “We have it in our power to begin the
world over again.”

Because I felt that we do have that power. And coming from the rally,
gluey echoes fading behind us, and all of us so happy if a little cold,
I wanted to remark to Mollie and Fati and Fariba about the pamphlet now
14 blocks to our north and my hope that the Iraqis also feel they have
the power to begin their world anew and throw off their own dumb King
George.

I'm amazed this discussion is still going on, and in the case of Mr.
or Ms. Primeau (probably Mr. there's a goodly degree of "masculine"
post-slacker pseudo-radical snarkiness in his tone), all I can say is:
a lot of times when folks invoke the abstract (to them) "poor black
woman" or "young Palestinian woman" as a means of discrediting
outraged attention paid to government-sanctioned murder of a Rachel
Corrie or a Viola Liuzzo, or -- moving further back in time -- a
Sophie Scholl, who didn't stick to their middle-class enclaves and
wring their hands about those abstract (to them) poor Palestinian,
Black, or Jewish folks, but took whatever direct action they saw fit
to take against oppression -- such armchair "critics" betray their own
smug and yes, white imagined superiority and fake enlightenment,
confusing the blood on their hands for a cool tattoo and exposing --
to paraphrase Raoul Vaneigem -- the corpses in their own mouths.

I agree.  Names are our handles into differentiation.  The iconic status =
of Rachel Corrie, if such exists, is possible in her home culture because =
her name is pronounceable, as, perhaps to a lesser extent, is her image.  =
Quibbling with the very limitations which enable the identity "Rachel =
Corrie" to emerge, in the United States, seems spurious, given the very =
unusual and in many ways exemplary character of that identity.  Using the =
generalized example, without the personal name, often indicates that even =
a limited particularity is unavailable i.e., the speaker is neither =
well-informed nor greatly interested in the topic at hand.  The unnamed =
example, in reference to human beings, is often not useful, and can be =
extremely dangerous to the identities thereby blurred.  To quote myself: =
"Becoming a metaphor endangers your health."  I'm sorry about the =
wordiness of this post.  I don't know what got into me.

I come at this from a different perspective. I'm also amazed that the
discussion continues, and at the pietism of most of the repondents.
No one was paying much attention to this thread until Nudel's little
Rabelaisian fantasy, which provoked some to fantasize that just maybe
he was still on the list because the listowners were insensitive to
gender issues. This prompted a lineup that would have done a
pentecostal church proud of people declaring that they never had
inappropriate thoughts vis a vis gender, when gender wasn't, I'd
guess, the reason for the reaction in the first place--hard to
imagine the list making much fuss if the butt of the joke were
Lynndie England instead of Rachel Corrie.

I'll admit to finding Nudel's little scenario offensive, too. If
satire offends one is probably the target.

So here are some thoughts.

1. Responsibility and culpability are separate categories. The girl
who unique among people who've heard of him didn't know that Mike
Tyson is dangerous bears some responsibility for what happened to
her, but no culpability If t were otherwise we couldn't educate our
children nor conduct therapy. Similarly, Rachel Corrie bears some of
the responsibility for her death, but no culpability. Please note
that I'm not implying that they deserved what happened to them. I
don't deserve to be hit by a car if I cross the street against the light.

2. There's a difference between the hurtful and the harmful. Nudel's
fantasy may have been hurtful, but it's hard to imagine that it was
harmful--nobody's politics were changed, for example.

3. This is a list of writers. We may know a little about politics,
and we certainly have opinions and sympathies. But our focus and
expertise are in the ways that language and image are employed, for
good or ill. Which means that what Rachel Corrie represents as icon
ought to be a subject for discussion. That we wouldn't be treated to
the diary entries and emails of a black woman, or a lesbian who fit
the popular caricatures, or a man who had been killed in similar
circumstances is precisely of the matter for us.

So here goes. Remember when a young, petite blond National
Guardswoman was captured during the drive to Baghdad? The story was
floated that she had fought heroically against her captors, going
down in a hail of gunfire, after which she was raped, and taken to a
hospital where she was further mistreated, even tortured. Our
military mounted a raid and rescued her from her fiendish captors.
Turns out that little of this was true. According to her own account,
in several lengthy television interviews, the heroic one was another
woman soldier, who died fighting. A heavyset Latina, no where near as
good for propaganda. That she wasn't raped--her captors removed her
to a civilian hospital with great dispatch, where she was treated
with great kindness and professional skill. The rescue unit burst
into the hospital, which was unguarded, terrified everyone, and did
considerable damage to the facilities, however.

I wish I remembered her name. She seemed like a nice kid. And
central-casting perfect for the role the pentagon tried to place her
in. America's sweetheart.

Some time in the Middle Ages most of Europe decided that the image of
innocence was a fair-haired adolescent girl, and the ur-innocent, the
Virgin Mary, was usually so portrayed thereafter, although she surely
would have looked rather like an Arab. Wouldn't have done at all. The
image of innocence has since then been colored by that portrayal,
often by racists, whether nazis or white suprematists.

In the US this icon of innocence has often taken on a surreptitious
prurience: Mary Pickford, Shirley Temple. America's Sweetheart may be
provocative--squirmy little thing, full of curls and energy (rather
like a cocker spaniel, and I suspect the memory of tussling with
puppies may have something to do with the portrayal)--but she's
usually not overtly sexual.

Remember the girl in the redwood? Made a lot of news. Much more
cuddly than the guy who, also inhabiting a redwood, died in an
accident. He made the news in California for a few days, she was the
subject of tv documentaries.

Rachel Corrie isn't a perfect fit, but good enough to become useful propaganda.

I'll confess to being persuaded by the iconography. I live here too.
But it doesn't hurt to be aware of it--next time around the icon is
likely to be used by the other side..

In case I've left anyone unoffended, here's a gender fantasy. Think
for a moment about Jeanne d'Arc, la Pucelle, who's the very
embodiment of the icon. She came to the Dauphin to say that her
voices had told her to crossdress and save France. Her crossdressing
was way more inappropriate then than it would be now--it helped to
get her burned at the stake. But imagine instead Jean d'Arc, le
Puceau. He comes to the Dauphin in women's clothes, ready to save
France. He would have been laughed out of court. Far less threatening
to the social order. But also far less effective as icon--even had he
succeeded, it's difficult to imagine that the French government would
have leaned quite so hard on the Vatican to have him declared a
saint, difficult to imagine that he would have been conflated in the
popular imagination with Marianne, the female embodiment of the nation.

By their opposites shall ye know them. If Rachel Corrie is reduced to
being the good angel of our natures, Lynndie England is the imp that
we're embarrassed to admit lives within us. Sadism and crude
sexuality. In my case pietism tends to call her forth, and the
subject heading "A candle for Rachel Corrie" carries both its churchy
meaning and its pornographic opposite.

Point is, we get demerits not for having "bad thoughts," or even for
expressing them, but for acting on them. And maybe we get some
demerits for dehumanizing the dead and wielding their corpses as
"exemplary" weapons. Surely the sainted dead were more complex than that.

Those who disagree might want to consult Bunyan's "Faith Aboundin to
the Chief of Sinners," in which he recounts his struggles with and
eventual triumph over his impulse to think of a bad word.

Mark

Yet and still -- Jessica Lynch ("Saving Private Lynch," remember the
tabloids?) is alive, though symbolically "dead" as a celebrity as
she's been sent to the Coventry of anonymity for daring to be quoted
about the lie behind her iconizing.  Nobody slimed her though.  Nudel,
however, perpetrated a slime-job in his attempt to channel the spirit
of Julius Streicher while talking about Rachel Corrie (and Edward Said
for that matter, whose surname was probably enough to inspire Nudel's
hatred -- he clearly hasn't read the man).  And Lynndie England (along
with her fellow female scapegoat perps, Megan Ambuhl and Sabrina
Harman) is still among the living -- she got her slap on the wrist for
carrying out her end of official US policy.

And didn't Graham Greene cause something of a stir for saying that
there was something pedophilic about Shirley Temple's movies?  Nothing
puppyish about her appeal, according to him -- I believe he mentioned
her childish butt as a, well, active element in her popular appeal.
But other than that both Temple and Corrie were blonde, where's the
comparison?

I mean, Corrie has parents who are living today (see today's
COUNTERPUNCH website).  We need to free people from being iconized,
mediatized, or otherwise put into the straitjacket of celebrity
culture, but that doesn't mean we should ignore their passion and
death, and it doesn't mean we should keep silent when they are
gratuitously -- and posthumously -- slandered.  Joan of Arc -- more
than five hundred years on -- cannot be usefully compared with Rachel
Corrie in terms of their respective experiences.  Sophie Scholl and
Viola Liuzzo can.

Jessica Lynch--thanks for the name--has become more obscure than
Lynndie England because, finally, sex and decadence sell. Lynndie
England may not think that punishment and punitive celebrity were a
slap on the wrist--hard to imagine how one could live with that kind
of exposure, unless she's sociopathic, in which case it's equally
hard to know what, short of death, would have made an impression on her.

I think I was implying pretty broadly that America's Sweetheart is
usually a pornographic fantasy or meant to be the inspiration of
same. I was also implying that tussling with puppies has a sexual
content (sorry, doglovers).

I was talking about an iconic image. Its durability is a sign of its
power. To fit a woman into that straightjacket she needs first to be
reduced to a cipher. It's easy to do that with the very young: Rachel
Corrie's words are hardly revelatory of deep philosophical insight,
and no reason they should be. And of course icons are not
entitled  the protections due to the real person who happen to bear
the same name. Use her as a weapon on either side and she's likely to
get dented.

While I'm at it, your last seemed to me to be employing a rhetoric
I've encountered in survivors' groups I've run, what I call (I'm sure
there's a generally accepted term that I'm not aware of) the
hierarchy of moral entitlement, by which I mean that virtue is
awarded to those who've suffered most, the dead therefore sanctified.
Or, more simply, "who are you to criticize the dead?" Of course, if I
have to be dead to speak with moral authority about the dead
conversation becomes pretty limited.

Which it is, on this list at least. You and I have shot our bolts for
the day, having spent our two message allotment. Any potshots anyone
wants to make will of necessity go unanswered. Just remember,
potshooters, you have an unfair advantage.

Back to reading Cuban poetry. Oops, I just had an inappropriate
thought about Cubans.

I'm just kind of amazed how the real issue of censorship keeps getting
obscured. (OK, I accept some blame, for getting hot under the collar at the
incredible misogyny displayed in some posts on this forum. And despite
Mark's fondness for alleging that sexism is a side issue that is largely
illusory, I reckon it does - Mark, would you be so sanguine if there was an
equivalent anti-Semitism here, say, quoting Protocols of Zion libels?).

All this Rachel Corrie discussion is happening because a Royal Court play
based on Corrie's private writings was pulled by a New York company with a
reputation for producing politically controversial work. The Nation has a
good backgrounding story on that fuss, which is ongoing -

http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060403/weiss

Robert Fisk of The Independent talks about the wider context and
implications - how this is part of a much wider repression of open
discussion about the Israel/Palestine question.

http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article12299.htm

It is something that has been felt in academia too, witness the shameful
campaign against Joseph Massad at Columbia, and countless other examples.

After some private discussion with Mark Weiss, whom I have offended deeply,
I would like to say that I did not mean by my comments here that I thought
Mark was a misogynist. Nor do I think that. For that unfair imputation, I
apologise.

I have not in fact claimed that anyone here is a misogynist - I don't have
such privileged access to the personalities of most people here - and have
confined my protests to the misogyny expressed in certain postings.

As for my remark about the Protocols of Zion, which Mark also found
offensive, and which I allow was careless: I did not mean that Harry Nudel's
posting was equivalent to that document. I meant that if someone posted a
"satirical" fantasy based on the blood libel, that would be equivalent in
offensiveness and implicit violence. I stand by that.

And now I'm outta here.

This argument over Rachel Corrie's provocative image - using her body to
contest the Israeli demolition of Palestinian homes - reminds me of
Godard/Gorin's once infamous argument over Jane Fonda's use of her star
image where, in their view, she was photographed in Hanoi as a grieving
Madonna figure surrounded by Vietnamese to protest both the war and the
bombing of North Vietnam. Godard & Gorin - as then Maoists - found her
exploitation/manipulation of that iconography as another sinister
implantation of the colonial West on to the East.
Their movie, Letter to Jane, no matter the real merits of the  critical
argument, has also been responded to as (also) a misogynist work. (It is
suggested they also both had personal issues with Jane who was in one of
their previous movies that was a box office bomb).  The article quote
(below) from the Village Voice speaks to some of this.

Rachel Corrie - at least to my limited knowledge - did not have any 'star'
status associated with her political involvement with the events that led t=
o
her death - nor did she 'grandstand' her death. (I suspect, like many
innocents, she believed, in spite of obvious dangers, that nothing so stupi=
d
could ever happen to her.) Unlike Fonda, all of that, her elevation, or
re-demolition, as a person seems a post-mortal construction of her
enemies/detractors and supporters. Ironically, she will never know the
nature of what has now hit her - in celebration or abuse.

The Village Voices excerpt:

"...Fred Gardner, a onetime comrade of Fonda's (credited with provoking her
interest in the G.I. movement), "The way people related to Jane Fonda=8Btry
though she might to be plain Jane=8Bwas not pleasant to observe. Everybody
wanted something=8Bmoney, an appearance, a favor, a quote, a picture, a
connection, a mention, an endorsement. At the same time, they bombarded her
with charges of 'elitism' designed to maximize her guilt." Thus, Fonda was
punished by Godard and Gorin in their extraordinary Letter to Jane=8Ba
52-minute analysis of a single news photo of Fonda taken during her trip to
Hanoi.=20

The North Vietnamese also understood the value of stardom. Narrated by
Godard and Gorin themselves in English and condescendingly addressed to "yo=
u
Jane," this no-frills tract=8Ba criticism not of Jane but of "the function of
Jane"=8Bfinds her Hanoi performance somewhat lacking. As she did in Klute,
Fonda played the "tragic actress." Her facial expression in the photograph
("an expression of an expression") isn't even her own. Godard and Gorin fin=
d
it on father Henry's face in The Grapes of Wrath and Young Mr. Lincoln. Eve=
n
John Wayne struck this thoughtful pose in The Green Berets. Poor Jane
doesn't realize that, in dramatizing her concern, she has made herself the
poster child for idealistic philosophy: "I think, therefore I am."

Alternately brilliant and obtuse, Letter to Jane is underscored by a willfu=
l
na=EFvet=E9 even greater than Fonda's. Furious at being upstaged, Godard and
Gorin regard the actress as the author of the photograph=8Bresponsible for
everything from the camera angle to the magazine caption that erroneously
describes her as asking a question. Triumphantly, the filmmakers point out
that in fact she is listening, as well she should. "I am keeping my mouth
shut because I admit I have nothing to say" is the film's conclusion=8Ba line
placed in the actress's closed and unmoving mouth.

'Letter to Jane' reduced Fonda to pinup once more, but the actress was not
quite through. "It was like a movie but she was living it. She was acting
the part of Jane Fonda in a big adventure..." And Tom was the hero of the
movie," Fonda's former husband Roger Vadim said of this period....

Some things I thought you might be interested to know....

James Wagner's Trilce is now available for your reading pleasure. The 77
poems in James Wagner's Trilce are homophonic translations of César Vallejo’
s book of the same name, or at least that was the cathartic process Wagner
underwent—in creating them, his versions take on a life of their own. Read
and listen to some online samples, as well as what Rosmarie Waldrop and
Michael Burkard have to say about Wagner's Trilce, here:
http://calamaripress.com/Trilce.htm

You can get yourself a copy of this Trilce directly from Calamari Press, or
from Powells: http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=1-0977072320-0

To celebrate the release of his new book, James Wagner will be coming out to
NYC for a whirlwind weekend of readings. April 29 at 2 PM he will be at the
Tarpaulin Sky/Frequency Series at the Four-faced Liar. Later that evening at
7 PM, he will be at Pete's Candy Store in Brooklyn. Then on Sunday April 30
at 7 PM, he will be at the Lungfull series at Zinc bar.

Other Calamari Press news:

*** Upcoming on Sunday, March 26 at 4:30 PM : Using images from the
exhibition Shoot the Family as a backdrop, Peter Markus will be reading at
the Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield, Michigan. More info:
http://www.cranbrookart.edu/museum/lectures.html

*** Upcoming on April 5-7, Calamari Press & Sleepingfish will be at the &NOW
Literary Festival in Chicago. Peter Markus, Steve Timm and Michael Peters
will be reading/performing and artwork & books will be on display. More
info: http://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/programs/engl/andnow/

*** Pseudo reviews of James Tate, Aase Berg and Lara Glenum in the guise of
Inverse Anthropomorphisms and Animistic Animals were recently posted on
5¢ense Reviews: www.5cense.com

*** New stuff on the horizon:  the next issue of Sleepingfish (for which we
will be reading submissions for until April 1st), a new book by John Olson,
a re-release of Peter Markus's Good, Brother, and a new book by yours truly
if I can get my act together.

Hope you have the time to check some of this stuff out. Thanks,

There's an eye-opening - at least for me - article
(http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n06/mear01_.html
) in this weeks London Review of Books which goes into detail about
the suppression of debate in this area by various organisations such
as the AIPAC.

I can almost hear the LRBs inbox groaning under the influx of comments.

Large publishing houses may offer a few authors a big advance and a big
print run, but if initial sales disappoint the home office, books are
quickly remaindered, and editors tend not to return your phone calls.
Not so with the small, independent presses. Their editors are true book
lovers, not cold-hearted bean counters. The independents offer help with
publicity, support for first time authors, and access to foreign and
theatrical rights.



Join this third in a series of panel discussions jointly sponsored by
the NWUâ€™s New York Chapter and Coliseum Bookstore as they welcome
alternative publishers Johnny Temple (Akashic Books), Laura Hruska (SoHo
Press), Dr. Sam Chekwas (Seaburn Books), and Ellen Moynihan (Asst.
Director, Small Press Center) as they discuss the advantages
of independent alternative publishers. Panel discussion moderated by
NWUâ€™s Education Committee co-chair Tim Sheard.

i helped out at an event last night that featured mr. belafonte speaking. his words were like balm on a wound, his ways of expressing things so compassionate and thoughtful; i was deeply touched.

every time he was asked a question to which he could have easily, even justifiably responded with derision or bitterness, he answered instead with reflection, following the path of "how might i be responsible for [the problem at hand]? how might any of us be? and what can we do about it?"

i realized at the end of the evening that various recent threads from this list seemed to be coming together for me in that night. ie:

what music i'm listening to (and i loved that question, and the responses, thanks!): i will very shortly be purchasing from my local indie record store the belafonte albums that i don't already have. (beyond that, a brief sample: yesterday wire and a new band called the dust dive; today slint and pop radio. most every day, cds from various friends of mine. music is playing here all the time.)

re rachel corrie: i learned last night that "rachel's words" is going to be performed on march 22 at riverside church (490 riversinde drive) here in nyc. www.rachelswords.org for tickets.

and re biography, i am actually reading a biography that a friend gave me on anna wintour (called "front row"). it was given as kind of a joke since i work sometimes with magazines like anna's. i thought i might find it amusing, but actually it's pretty depressing: child from cold and unloving but wealthy household becomes cold, unloving, and in fact particularly hateful (and hated)--but wealthy!--adult who drapes herself in dead animals whenever there's the slightest chill in the air. no breakthrough, no reflection, no redemption--the sad cycle of her childhood repeated, and amplified.

on this sad 3-year anniversary, i vow to do my best in life to follow harry's thought paths and reject anna's. less bitterness, more reflection; less hostility, more forward-looking determination. to recast one more recent thread: "does one person matter?" we're all limited in our power. but we must work with, do our best with, what we have. best, pam

"LIVING FOR WORDS: POETS AND POETRY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA"

IWOSC General Meeting
Monday, March 27
7:30 p.m.
Veterans Memorial Building, 4117 Culver Blvd. (Culver City)

On the eve of National Poetry Month, the Independent
Writers of Southern California (IWOSC) hosts a panel of
poets discussing the poetic life in Los Angeles.

Please join Keven Bellows, a Los Angeles teacher, and
author of the poetry collection, "Taking Your Own True
Name," Sarah Maclay, the prize-winning author of three
limited-edition chapbooks and the book "Whore," Deborah
Edler Brown, an award-winning poet and journalist,
performer and storyteller, author and teacher, 1997 Head-to-
Head Haiku champion, member of the 1998 Los Angeles Poetry
Slam team and the 2005 recipient of the Sue Saniel Elkind
Poetry Prize, and Catherine Daly, the author of two books
of poetry, the trilogy "DaDaDa" (part of a long project
entitled "CONFITEOR") and the collection "Locket."

The panel discussion will be moderated by Jim Natal, the
curator and co-host of the long-running Poem.X monthly
poetry series in Santa Monica.

The poets on the panel will share their work and shed some
light on the life of a poet in Southern California. They
will discuss the poetry (and readings) scene here, the
business and publishing side of poetry (as in, can a poet
earn a living at writing?), and how the discipline of
writing poetry can improve other forms of writing.

Inaugurated by the Academy of American Poets in April 1996,
National Poetry Month (NPM) brings together publishers,
booksellers, literary organizations, libraries, schools,
and poets around the country to celebrate poetry and its
vital place in American culture. Poetry Month highlights
the extraordinary legacy and ongoing achievement of
American poets, brings poets and poetry to the public in
immediate and innovative ways, and makes poetry a more
important part of the school curriculum.

Deborah Edler Brown's poetry has appeared in three
anthologies, as well as in various journals such as Nimrod
and Kalliope. She is a reporter for Time magazine and co-
author of "Grandparents as Parents: A Survival Guide to
Raising a Second Family." As a performer, Brown tells poems
and stories in theaters, libraries, bookstores and bars
across the country. Her other workshops include "How to
Tell a Poem and Other Solo Acts," and "Loving the Clock:
Celebrate Yourself at Every Age" (a workshop for women).
She holds a degree in creative writing from Brown
University.

Keven Bellows has been writing poetry for the last 20 years
and has studied recently with poets Suzanne Lummis, Jack
Grapes, and David St. John. She is a communications
executive, and was educated at Wellesley College where she
was taught by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Richard Wilbur
and poets Phillip Booth and David Ferry. Bellows is married
to legendary journalist Jim Bellows.

Sarah Maclay's poems, reviews, and essays have appeared in
Ploughshares, FIELD, Hotel Amerika, The Writer's Chronicle,
Solo, Pool, ZZYZYVA, lyric, Ninth Letter, The Laurel
Review, and numerous other publications including Poetry
International, where she serves as book review
editor. "Whore," her debut full-length poetry collection,
won the Tampa Review Prize for Poetry, and she has received
an Albert and Elaine Borchard Fellowship and several
Pushcart nominations. She was also a winner of the dA
Center for the Arts Poetry Contest, a finalist for the Blue
Lynx Prize, and a semi-finalist for the Kenyon Review
Poetry Prize, the Cleveland State University Poetry Prize,
and the Tupelo Press First Book Prize. The author of three
limited edition chapbooks, "Ice from the Belly," "Shadow of
Light," and "Weeding the Duchess," Maclay holds degrees
from Oberlin College and Vermont College, and has most
recently been teaching in Los Angeles at LMU, USC and FIDM,
as well as conducting workshops both privately and,
periodically, at Beyond Baroque.

With humor, sensibility and style, Catherine Daly writes
about the recognizable signposts of life, love and loss. An
Illinois Scholar at Trinity College and Merit Fellow at
Columbia University, Daly has worked as a technical
architect, officer in a Wall Street investment bank,
engineer supporting the space shuttle orbiter, software
developer for motion picture studios, teacher, critic,
editor, and curator. She has four books forthcoming this
year, "Secret Kitty," "Paper Craft," "To Delite and
Instruct," and "Chanteuse / Cantatrice."  When she began
working developing online business environments, she began
publishing her work online; she also developed UCLA
Extension's first online poetry workshop. Now Daly is
launching herself as a publisher of other poets' e-
chapbooks and of eBooks of modernist poetry.  Two of her
books will be offered in free eBooks and in print-on-demand
paper formats because the way the poems are read / the
nature of these particular poems changes online and in
print, bound and unbound.

Jim Natal's first full-length collection, "In the Bee
Trees," was a finalist for the Pen Center West and
Publishers Marketing Association Ben Franklin Awards in
2000. A second collection, "Talking Back to the Rocks," was
published in 2003. His poetry has been published in
numerous publications including The Cafe Review, Runes,
Pool, The Paterson Literary Review, The Yalobusha Review,
Solo, and ArtLife. Natal's work also has appeared in the
anthologies "What Have You Lost?," "Fresh Water," the new
anthology of California poets, "So Luminous the
Wildflowers," and the upcoming "Mischief, Caprice and Other
Poetic Strategies." Natal has been the featured poet at
dozens of California venues.

Oracular by Timothy Bradford

Timothy Bradford's poetry and other writings have appeared in Bombay Gin,
Diagram, Forward, H_NGM_N, JBooks, No Tell Motel, Poems & Plays, Runes,
and Terminus. He is the author of the introductory text for Sadhus, a
photography book on the ascetics of South Asia published by Cuerpos
Pintados in 2003, and his novella-in-progress, based on the history of the
Velodrome d'Hiver in Paris, garnered the support of the Koret Foundation's
Young Writer on Jewish Themes Award for 2004-2005. In the fall of 2005, he
was a writer-in-residence and visiting lecturer at Stanford University.

An excerpt from Oracular, the first stanza:

The other day, my youngest son in the carrier
on my back and my body warm with the rhythm
of filling, shovelful by shovelful, the third
wheelbarrow load that would go to the garden,
I thought of how some dubiously elected
world leaders would benefit from mucking stalls.
The sun was out for the first time in weeks,
a bright hydrogen-supported star burning
and roiling roughly ninety-two million miles
away, one astronomical unit, A.U., the perfect
distance for such a golden thing
as opposed to just over one's head.
Curious the difference distance can make,
like Kokura was almost Nagasaki....

Read all of Oracular in Mudlark, and hear Timothy Bradford read it too,
via streaming audio.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

I suppose everyone knows the great Belafonte story about when he was a =
young man, trying to educate himself, going into a big library and =
insisting the librarian bring him
certain works by Ibid (from a list he had compiled from footnotes in Du =
Bois) and getting angry when told there was no such author, convinced the =
librarian was trying to keep him in darkness. That he told this story =
about himself bears out what you say below, Pam.  He said all his choices =
have been deliberate, which speaks to the sense of responsibility you =
mention.
Mairead

>>> Pam Grossman <pamelabeth@MINDSPRING.COM> 03/19/06 2:18 PM >>>
i helped out at an event last night that featured mr. belafonte speaking. =
his words were like balm on a wound, his ways of expressing things so =
compassionate and thoughtful; i was deeply touched.

every time he was asked a question to which he could have easily, even =
justifiably responded with derision or bitterness, he answered instead =
with reflection, following the path of "how might i be responsible for =
[the problem at hand]? how might any of us be? and what can we do about =
it?"

i realized at the end of the evening that various recent threads from this =
list seemed to be coming together for me in that night. ie:

what music i'm listening to (and i loved that question, and the responses, =
thanks!): i will very shortly be purchasing from my local indie record =
store the belafonte albums that i don't already have. (beyond that, a =
brief sample: yesterday wire and a new band called the dust dive; today =
slint and pop radio. most every day, cds from various friends of mine. =
music is playing here all the time.)

re rachel corrie: i learned last night that "rachel's words" is going to =
be performed on march 22 at riverside church (490 riversinde drive) here =
in nyc. www.rachelswords.org for tickets.

and re biography, i am actually reading a biography that a friend gave me =
on anna wintour (called "front row"). it was given as kind of a joke since =
i work sometimes with magazines like anna's. i thought i might find it =
amusing, but actually it's pretty depressing: child from cold and unloving =
but wealthy household becomes cold, unloving, and in fact particularly =
hateful (and hated)--but wealthy!--adult who drapes herself in dead =
animals whenever there's the slightest chill in the air. no breakthrough, =
no reflection, no redemption--the sad cycle of her childhood repeated, and =
amplified.=20

on this sad 3-year anniversary, i vow to do my best in life to follow =
harry's thought paths and reject anna's. less bitterness, more reflection; =
less hostility, more forward-looking determination. to recast one more =
recent thread: "does one person matter?" we're all limited in our power. =
but we must work with, do our best with, what we have. best, pam

Here's an extract from a longish post I wrote this morning on =20
Nomadics blog (http://pjoris.blogspot.com) that comes from and is a =20
prolongation of this thread, and goes on to a recently published =20
piece of research on the Israel Lobby & US Foreign policy:

"This past saturday's post (concerning an upcoming gig) got a =20
"comment" from an anonymous mailer with the handle "why palestinians =20
usually get it wrong," and which concerned Rachel Corrie and the =20
suppressed play based on her writings. Here are two extracts from =20
this "comment":

     'Three years ago Thursday, Rachel Corrie was accidentally killed =20=

by an Israeli bulldozer after she entered a closed Israeli military =20
zone to protect Palestinian homes that were sitting on top of tunnels =20=

used by Palestinian terrorists to smuggle illegal weapons to be used =20
against Israeli civilians. Rachel Corrie was a member of the =20
International Solidarity Movement (ISD), a firm supporter of =20
Palestinian terrorism (what the ISD calls =93resistance=94), =93by any =20=

means necessary.=94....
     Palestinian terrorism insures that Israeli bulldozers have very =20
litlte visibility because of the need to protect the driver with =20
metal shielding. Ms. Corrie chose to lay down in front of a =20
bulldozer. Her act was not one of peace, but of suicide. Clearly Ms. =20
Corrie spent too much time in the company of suicide killers and =20
their supporters.'

Now, a few weeks ago I had indeed mentioned the fact that the play =20
based on Rachel Corrie's writings had been censored in New York. This =20=

I had learned from a post by the Australian writer Alison Croggon on =20
the Buffalo Poetics list =97 a post which generated a long and heated =20=

debate, with some of the truly ugliest posts I have witnessed since =20
the inception of that list. Surprised? No. Whenever it comes to =20
Palestine and the cynical, imperialist and repressive politics of the =20=

state of Israel, this place (the U.S. of A) acts like a famously =20
stupid bird: it stuffs its head in the sand & refuses to acknowledge =20
what is clear to the vast majority of people around the world.

And if the good denizens are not performing this act of self-blinding =20=

fast enough, they get help by having their heads shoved into the sand =20=

by a range of more or less anonymous orgs, both long-standing and ad =20
hoc, with both access to the largest US media outlets and with an eye =20=

on the smallest places of resistamnce, such as my little-visited =20
blog. Thus this "why palestinians usually get it wrong" post =20
mentioned above.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
the final event in our New Experiments Poetry Talk series
Alicia Cohen on Lyric Creatures: new poetics and the animal
Friday, March 24, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Cohen writes: ?What is our obligation as lyric poets to other beings? How are
contemporary lyric poems, as they plumb and/or rewire our subjectivities,
opening up new modes of ethical relation with the world and other beings? In
the lyric?s fantastical mirror animals often serve as figures for human
nature. Indeed, our sense of human being is dependent upon an animal Other for
its sovereignty?the man/beast dichotomy. We share an undeniable intimacy with
animals, but there is a massive gulf between us. In part we are troubled that
animals may be watching us and, at the same time, we are troubled that,
perhaps, they are not. If only they had language, it would seem, we might
understand them?or, because they don?t have language, the common thinking
goes, they are fundamentally different than people and can, therefore, be
treated inhumanely. But it?s not just language that makes us human, it is also
the ability to recognize ourselves in the mirror. In fact, according to
Jacques Lacan, for whom language is so central to understanding the human, we
enter the phallic order of culture not through *talking* but through gazing at
ourselves in *mirrors* as toddlers. And, similarly, in Ethology and the animal
rights movement, some animals? ability to recognize themselves in mirrors (not
their ability to use language) has become key in the debate about animal
self-consciousness. What do animals have to tell us about our mirrored selves?
If mirrors open a passageway into the order of human history and law, then is
there a way to look into mirrors?or lyric poems?that would open us to
non-human voices and systems??


Alicia Cohen is a poet, artist, critic, and teacher. Her book of poems, Bear,
was published by Handwritten Press in 2000. In 2003 she wrote, directed, and

recently a visiting professor of English at Reed College. She is a co-founder
of the art space collective Pacific Switchboard in Portland, Oregon, where she

Anyone who makes it to NY might want to get to the Met Museum and
leave plenty of time after the Rauschenberg exhibit to check out a
major show of Samuel Palmer's work. Palmer became a friend of Blake's
three years before the latter's death, and his work shows some of
Blake's influence, but that's the least of it. His small watercolors
and oils, his etchings, and his astonishing drawings pack tremendous
power into very small amounts of space. His work anticipates
Barbizon, Pre-Raphaelites and Post-Impressionism, but forget art
history: the work is sui generis.

i think kent's most recent book is occasionally mean-spirited and on
this basis (knowing kent) beneath him at times, and even occasionally
(factually) wrong... it's not that there is no place for
mean-spiritedness in writing/poetry, you understand---it's more a
matter of who is being picked on, and for what reasons, and
occasionally i get the impression that the wrong person is being
picked on for the wrong reasons... still, you have to contextualize
each entry, and you have to consider, too, the tradition out of which
kent is self-avowedly writing... there's a lot of praise, unabashed
praise, scattered in these pages, and it's funny as hell at times...

i should add too that since i'm not myself an entry in the book, i
can't speak to how it feels to be personally skewered...

that said, and for the most part, i think the book is a conceptually
alive, inspired artifact, and i think we'd all do well to read it...
and hey, for what it's worth:  once you start reading it, you can't
put it down (and it's a quick read)... i wouldn't (with ron s) align
it with porn (ron?)---it's far too measured to label it so, and it
doesn't really pander, finally, even in its praise (some of which is
of the easter-bunny variety, for that matter, and something of a
send-up in such terms)---but i would say that its intended audience
is poets, and its intended target is poetic celebrity and variations
thereof... ultimately it would seem to mount a challenge to the idea
of artistic community and ethos... inadvertently (?), it might be
forging an imagined community by situating itself outside of any
mainstream/avant divide... which isn't to suggest that kent himself
is not part of an "inside" as such...

see chris daniels's review, very astute (i might quibble with items
here, but it's a smart appraisal):

http://nftseries.blogspot.com/

and francois luong's review, also insightful:

http://www.mipoesias.com/Columns/Luong-Francois_johnson_kent.html

herewith i add my own epigram to kent's collection --  of myself,
having failed to rate a mention (ok, i'm just pretending to be
passive-aggressive!):

Joe Amato

He says a-mahto
you say a-mayto:
he talks, and talks
and doesn't seem to know
where his words end
and his tomatoes begin.

I saw/heard kari read in Philly at Robin's Books yesterday. It was amazing.
If you don't have her new book Disobedience yet, do yourself a favor & get
it soon. I couldn't put the book down until I finished, reading through it
last night in one sitting. What an experience!

The week began with Tom Raworth's burnin' down the house reading at Kelly
Writers House. Jonathan Skinner read from great new work on Saturday night
at The Khyber. kari ended it on a hot note. What a great week for poetry in
Philadelphia.

Two thoughts:

Digging at celebrity reinforces celebrity, of course. So, that said, oh to
be a celebrity! The sun glasses, the cool outfits. Kent Johnson, have you no
heart? So many Amato/potato possibilities! And how about "John Gallaher
should have more hair"? The slant rhyme is delicious! And mentioning
Silliman, you had to know he would just count the entries! Ah, me. It's so
glitzy, this world of poetry. Belz smelz? Ah, but tells... don't forget. And
he bought me lunch just last week. And then all these possibilities to vent,
saying Kent is bent. You just had to know. You just had to.

Or maybe that was just one thought. Or three.

Tarpaulin's Sky's reading series at the  Four Faced Liar in the West
Village. kari's great- I am  a long time fan, Tarpaulin Sky is great
too. Check both out if you haven't yet.

Haha. Sorry about that. That's the second time I did that today. But
Obedience should not be confused with Alice Notley's Disobedience. I think
this means I should re-read Disobedience soon, although not in one sitting.
I'm a slow reader, & I can't be late for work tomorrow morning.

The last time kari read in Philly was at La Tazza a few years ago, where she
irritated a pro-war dork in the crowd who left the reading yelling about
soldiers in Iraq fighting for people like her. She replied, "Not me. I'm
regulated, honey!"

Hi, alls - This is a phat annoucement of a series I'm curating at Towson Un=
iversity. The details are below: every Thursday at 5 PM we're hosting a rea=
ding by a student, faculty member, and a poet from the community. To celebr=
ate national poetry month, we're bringing together community and academia f=
or a full-on brawl. Check out below:



National Poetry Month Reading Series In Honor of Albert S. Cook, April 2006


Towson Room @ Cook Library
Towson University


Curator, Christophe Casamassima






Sponsored by=20

The Albert S. Cook Library
The English Department
The Honors College


On April 6, 2006, Towson University will host the first poetry reading of a=
 series for National Poetry Month at the Towson Room at Cook Library. Each =
week, we will invite a student, a current faculty member, and poet from the=
 community who has experienced prominence (or notoriety=85) to share their =
words and exchange views about the act of writing and its function in our p=
ublic, private and creative lives. We also encourage those who=92ll join us=
 to bring their praises and concerns: writing, after all, implies a communi=
ty, and it is necessary for the audience to have a voice, too.

This hopes to be the beginning of a tradition at Cook Library. The goal of =
the series is not so much to entertain the notion that poetry is recognized=
 in the world every 12 months. Instead, we will unite the act of writing wi=
th the community of writers and readers who wish to discuss important topic=
s concerning the state and place of poetry in our lives.

The readings have no schemata, no prefabricated goals, no ideals but to ope=
n the communities of Baltimore to a critical and literary experience. It wi=
ll function specifically as a locus of readings, questions and conversation.

We will have books for sale, and we will also accept donations of books of =
poetry for the library. We will also be following the readings with a ventu=
re away from the campus to a local watering spot (for those who wish to con=
tinue the exploration).






Thanks to Yvonne Lev & Nancy Gonce of Cook Library, Maria Fracasso & the Ho=
nors College, and Faculty of the English Department for their utmost suppor=
t and guidance.

ing takes its subject matter from his upbringing in a Bronx immigrant neigh=
borhood.=20

ace: New World Irish Stories, comes out of his experiences playing traditio=
nal Irish music with Celtic Thunder, a band he started with his brother Jes=
se in 1977. Many of the songs he wrote for Celtic Thunder recount the story=
 of New York's Irish community: with "When New York Was Irish," "Saints (Ha=
rd New York Days)," and "The Irish Riviera" the best-known of them. Celtic =
Thunder's second album, The Light of Other Days, won the prestigious INDIE =
award for Best Celtic Album in 1988.=20

Magus (M.) Magnus moved to the Mid-Atlantic region nearly three years ago, =
from New Orleans, Louisiana.  His first volume of poetry, Little Puddles, c=
ame out in New Orleans in 1993, and by its title alone could be considered =
a prescient example of the art of understatement with reference to the city=
 of its publication.  Since then, he has done poetry, prose, and theatrical=
 works in a variety of contexts both in New Orleans and around the D.C.-Bal=
timore area. His Commedia dell' Arte-inspired play, titled Harlequin, Again=

ive Writing Program at Catonsville High School and teaches poetry workshops=
 at The Writer's Center in Bethesda, MD.

A.E. Stallings says about =93Cleave=94 - "In these sexy poems, Moira Egan p=
lays within and against the bondage of form. The deep ambiguities of Egan=
=92s work are embodied in the economy of the title: both to cling and to se=
parate, the contrasting impulses to =91hold Love tight in a sonnet,=92 and =
to become a reverse Penelope who walks out the door of the happy ending, ab=
andoning the rooted bed. Lines linger with the reader, so that =91all day y=
ou are reminded/ it was delicious/ and it was bitter.=92"



April 27, 5:00 P.M.


Julie Reiser

Julie Reiser is a widely unpublished poet who is working on her first book =
of poems entitled, A Brief Theory of Men.  As with most English faculty, sh=
e also has part of the next great American novel buried in the bottom drawe=
r of her file cabinet.  It involves trepannation and other cultish practice=
s that seem to happen only in Utah.  After escaping from Utah and working o=
n Capitol Hill, she now loves teaching as a full-time Lecturer in the Engli=
sh Department at Towson University.  She is also an ABD doctoral candidate =
at The Johns Hopkins University where she is writing a dissertation entitle=
d, "The Problem of Consciousness and the Postmodern Text."  Her areas of in=
terest include 20th-century British and American literature, poetry, Easter=
n philosophy, science fiction, cognitive science, and some low-brow guilty =
pleasures that cannot be named in polite company.  When she is not flogging=
 her students for their inappropriate comma fetishes, she can be found sitt=
ing on her zafu or pretzling herself on her yoga mat.=20



Harvey Lillywhite

Harvey Lillywhite is first and foremost a lecturer in the English and Profe=
ssional Writing Programs at Towson University. He is the author of =93Ephem=
eral Blues,=94 which won the first annual Artscape Literary Awards 1985. In=
 the past he was a contributing editor of the Maryland Poetry Review, and c=
o-editor, with his wife Eileen, of Plum. He has received numerous awards fo=
r his poetry, including the Bennett Cerf Prize, the Academy of American Poe=
ts Award and, in 1989 an NEA grant.=20

This is a test.

The hammer of birds (rabbits) secure in the deficit garden, fog along the coast.

Water hammer, rock board -- recurrence as key in phlegmatic analysis (fellaheen
hurdling custard pie into the face of Bette Midler).

Friends are perpetually "going to get it together," jobwise: the coast is
altered one quarter inch.

Just like that.

The window conceived as a form of torture, through which a century is expressed
(blue hands, the chartreuse of a tennis ball): dobermans of delight crowd the sun.

Met against metaphor (I want white rooms): the cast is clear.

Up against the woolite, desire for narrative condemns millions -- French bread
hard as a rock.

Nouns aver facts (pinched nerve at base of neck): a terrycloth sweatband is an
insufficient monument (dress for excess), specific as the smell of chalk.

Words row.

The sun, backlighting your blouse, reveals all, newlyweds at a Grateful Dead
concert, birthmark of the surgeon general.

Birthright of way: foghorns and a rooster counterpoint hazy morning.

The outer wall of the prison is yellow, the inner one green (old paperback
bought at a garage sale).

Verb is the eye of the sentence (world stylized for efficiency's sake): dogs bark.

Dog barks -- there is another way to compute the tides.

Eminent ptomaine.

Poets propose sky, only to fall back on cannibalism (downhill on a skateboard).

Crudley mechanical, an adjective grinds meaning from a noun forming the perfect
countenance of Elvis on black velvet.

My pockets are a jungle.

High heels grind pavement into paste (memory of color scheme popular in past
war) -- the construction is not parallel (taster's choice), pruned tree's new
sprouts.

My hand on your thigh in a dream (not expected): if critics had ethics...a
suburb without sidewalks.

Flat country with clear conscience.


from /The Pink Institution/
by Selah Saterstrom

Willie lay in bed.  Through darkness he made out a figure standing in the
doorway.  Willie realized it was Death.  Death entered the room in long,
swooping strides.  He walked past Willie's bed and entered the adjoining
children's room.  Willie followed.  Death picked up a child at which point
Willie began to assault Death.  The two entered a wrestling match.  Willie won
with child in arms and Death defeated, got up to leave, but he brought his mouth
close and said, "You'll see me again."  Death looked like the popular renderings.

Philippines under de facto martial law


Right now, a crisis in the Philippines is being perpetuated by U.S.
imperialism and its puppet Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo....the principal
oppression being waged against the majority of women workers and
peasants right now is class oppression, and Macapagal-Arroyo is the
symbol of the bourgeois comprador class. She comes from one of the
handful of families that carry out the dictates of U.S.
imperialism....Another issue that has galvanized the Filipino people is
the gang rape in November 2005 of a Filipina woman by U.S. Marines. She
was raped and knocked unconscious. No action was taken against these six
Marines.

Philippines under de facto martial law
Published Mar 16, 2006 9:48 PM

The following is from a talk by Berna Ellorin of Bayan USA to an Inter
na tional Women’s Day forum sponsored by Workers World Party in New York
on March 10.

I’d like to salute all the women who work for change in the number-one
imperialist power in the world. Your contributions to the world
anti-imperialist struggle are important.

International Women’s Day is much celebrated in the Philippines. Within
the Bayan alliance, the confederation of women’s organizations called
Gabriela led mass demonstrations on March 8.

Women have historically played a very important role in advancing the
Filipin@ people’s struggle, beginning with Spanish colonial times, when
the first revolt was led by a woman named Gabriela.

During the 1970s when the U.S.-puppet regime of Ferdinand Marcos
declared martial law, a very dynamic women students’ organization was
formed called Makibaka. Like other legal, democratic organizations, it
was forced to go underground.

Activists targeted by the Marcos regime made a huge exodus from urban
centers to the countryside. Lorena Barros, founder of Makibaka, was one
of the first martyrs of the martial law. She had joined the New People’s
Army and was assassinated in an encounter.

Right now, a crisis in the Philippines is being perpetuated by U.S.
imperialism and its puppet Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Filipino culture and
society are historically very patriarchal, very Catholic. But the
principal oppression being waged against the majority of women workers
and peasants right now is class oppression, and Macapagal-Arroyo is the
symbol of the bourgeois comprador class. She comes from one of the
handful of families that carry out the dictates of U.S. imperialism.

Although the government denies it, there is a new martial law in the
Philip pines right now, since the regime declared a state of emergency.
It has provided the pretext for human rights violations like warrantless
arrests and the killing of mass leaders. Another Bayan leader was killed
yesterday in central Luzon.

The major news organizations are being monitored by the military. The
Philippines is now the most dangerous place in the world to practice
journalism.

Another issue that has galvanized the Filipino people is the gang rape
in November 2005 of a Filipina woman by U.S. Marines. She was raped and
knocked unconscious. No action was taken against these six Marines.

Only in January did the Philippine government issue a request to
transfer them from the jurisdiction of the U.S. Embassy. They have been
protected by an immunity clause in the visiting forces agreement, which
has allowed the reentry of U.S. troops in at least 20 ports all over the
archipelago. Not a single U.S. troop has ever been arrested or convicted
for any of their numerous sexual violations in the Philippines, which
has historically been used by the Pentagon as a gateway to the Asian
continent and a launching pad, refueling location and rest and
recreation area for U.S. wars of aggression overseas. Cara vans of women
and children are sent to areas where there are U.S. troops to pleasure
and service them.

That is one of the reasons we are with you in the call to bring the U.S.
troops home

We also want the U.S. government and the puppet government of
Macapagal-Arroyo to bring justice to all the victims of sexual
violations by U.S. troops, to arrest and convict all those who have
committed them.

The current regime is completely subservient to U.S. dictates. It has
proposed certain changes to the Philippine constitution, many of which
were authored by the U.S. itself, that have to do with selling the
country’s patrimony, its natural resources, public utilities and mass
media. All could be 100 percent foreign-owned.

On March 18 we’ll call for the scrapping of these charter changes and
will be marching with you in Times Square.

Currently, five congress members from Bayan are being held inside the
lower house of parliament. The military are waiting for them outside and
they can’t leave for threat of being arrested. One is Lisa Masa, a woman
who has committed her whole life to advancing Filipina women.

Many U.S. puppets have come and gone. The people’s democratic movement
has ousted two of them; we believe we can oust this one. No amount of
state terror can stop what the people started a century ago.

As a member of Bayan in New York, it is an honor to be declared an enemy
of this regime. No amount of labeling can suppress the voice of dissent
that is growing in the streets.

Long live the anti-imperialist women’s movement! Long live international
solidarity!

After Criticizing Bush([search]), Harry Belafonte Says he was Disinvited
from Delivering Eulogy at the Coretta Scott King Funeral

Monday, March 20th, 2006
http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/20/1439231

We hear from legendary musician, actor and humanitarian Harry Belafonte
on why he was disinvited from speaking at the funeral of Coretta Scott
King and how he been blacklisted in places due to his political views.
[includes rush transcript]

As we continue to mark the third anniversary of the Iraq([search])
invasion we turn now to look at how critics of the war have often been
silenced and punished for speaking out against the invasion and
occupation of Iraq as well as the Bush administration.

On Saturday, Democracy Now! interviewed legendary singer, actor and
humanitarian, Harry Belafonte at The Great Hall at Cooper Union.

He revealed the story behind why he was disinvited from the funeral of
Coretta Scott King even though he was a close friend of both Coretta and
her late husband, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

According to Belafonte, the King family originally invited him to help
eulogize Coretta Scott King but the family rescinded the invitation
after President Bush announced he would attend the funeral.

Just weeks earlier Belafonte had made international headlines when he
spoke out against President Bush during a trip to Venezuela to meet with
President Hugo Chavez.

In a moment we will hear Harry Belafonte discuss the controversy
surround Coretta Scott King's funeral but we begin with Harry Belafonte
talking about how artists are punished for speaking out.

AMY GOODMAN: On Saturday, Democracy Now! interviewed legendary singer,
actor and humanitarian, Harry Belafonte, at the Great Hall at Cooper
Union here in New York City. He revealed the story behind why he was
dis-invited from the funeral of Coretta Scott King, even though he was a
close friend of both Coretta and her late husband, the Reverend Dr.
Martin Luther King. According to Harry Belafonte, the King family
originally invited him to help eulogize Coretta Scott King, but the
family rescinded the invitation after President Bush announced he would
attend the funeral. Just weeks earlier, Harry Belafonte had made
international headlines when he spoke out against President Bush during
a trip to Venezuela to meet with President Hugo Chavez.

HARRY BELAFONTE: No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the
greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush, says, we're here to
tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American
people – millions – support your revolution, support your ideas, and
yes, expressing our solidarity with you.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Harry Belafonte speaking in Venezuela earlier this
year. In a moment, we’ll hear him discuss the controversy surrounding
Coretta Scott King's funeral, but we begin with Harry Belafonte talking
about how artists are punished for speaking out.

HARRY BELAFONTE: It is in culture that I think we come to know one
another. And we are in countries murdering, killing, destroying people,
and we have never heard their song. And perhaps if we had and perhaps if
we would listen to their song, we might find that we are not capable of
sending off our sons and daughters to murder.

It’s a great place to be, in the arts. It's a gift that's very hard to
define. So many great practitioners of art have already said so much,
but there is a spirit in it. There is an essence in it, that if it’s
applied to the human heart, if it’s applied to inspire people to trust,
I think the rewards from it are forever.

One of the things that was a mechanism and a device used to cruelly
punish artists who would speak out was to cut them off from their
livelihood. They did it to Paul Robeson. They wouldn't give him a
passport. Carnegie Hall wouldn't hire him or give – or rent him the
hall. Many of the places that he had sung, where people loved him, were
closed to him for a long period of time. But when that case was fought
and won in the courts, he was nourished again, because everybody in the
world was waiting for him.

And what has permitted me to sustain my own life in the midst of so much
cruelty and degradation -- I’ve lost a lot from those who control
culture, those who will not let my song be in the environment of their
sponsorship -- just my remarks on President Bush, that he’s a terrorist,
I lost a lot of work, even in universities, not even singing, just
fraternities and students that have invited me to come to speak. Many of
those doors in those universities were closed to me, because those who
sit on the board and the board of trustees said we are displeased with
what he said. He’ll have no place in this institution. And if he does,
you’ll no longer have our support. So the president and the dean becomes
frightened and becomes concerned. And it’s easier to let go than it is
to stand against the oppressor.

AMY GOODMAN: Who cancelled your engagements?

HARRY BELAFONTE: A university in Virginia, a company called [Eye Tech].
There is a difference between Eye Care, the foundation, and [Eye Tech] –
a company made up of doctors and scientists in the world of ophthalmology.

I was supposed to have gone to Chicago, and they said, “No, we have to
withdraw the contract.” That experience is not uncommon.

[EDITOR'S NOTE: After Democracy Now! aired today, Belafonte informed us
that the school was Bergen Community College in Paramus, New Jersey
where he was scheduled to speak soon. In addition, he said the Kansas
City Young Audiences also canceled an appearance.]

But I say that there is a place when one has to really make a choice,
and sometimes the choice is not easy until you make it, and then you
understand the rewards that are there from the choice you made, which
may have at the beginning frightened you or threatened you or
intimidated you.

AMY GOODMAN: More with Harry Belafonte in a minute.

[break]

AMY GOODMAN: Harry Belafonte here on Democracy Now!, democracynow.org,
the War and Peace Report. We spoke with him on Saturday night on the
10th anniversary of Democracy Now! at Cooper Union in New York City. I
was speaking with him along with Juan Gonzalez, co-host on Democracy
Now! and Pacifica Radio station WBAI’s program director, Bernard White.
We asked Harry Belafonte to explain what happened, why he didn't attend
the funeral of Coretta Scott King.

AMY GOODMAN: Harry, I have a quick question, talking about the children
and talking about Dr. King in Birmingham. Coretta Scott King recently
died, and it was quite a remarkable funeral. Over 10,000, 15,000 people
came out, four presidents, many senators. Reverend Joseph Lowery, while
President Bush was sitting right on the dais, talked about weapons of
misdirection right here, and President Carter talked about Dr. Martin
Luther King and Coretta Scott King being spied on, and Maya Angelou
stood up and said, “I speak here for Harry Belafonte and others.” Did
you try to go to Coretta Scott King's funeral?

HARRY BELAFONTE: What had happened was that when Dr. King came on one of
his very first trips to New York, he was in Harlem, and a deranged black
woman stabbed him, and he was -- the blade was just millimeters away
from his heart, and to remove the instrument, his life was in jeopardy,
and it was a very delicate operation. And it was then that I understood
that -- after seeing Dr. King and talking to him, his first concern was
what would happen to his family. And I said to myself, our leader cannot
be concerned about that. That burden should not be on his shoulders.
There are other aspects of the burden that would be his in relation to
it, but not that. So that it was demanded and responded to that forever
the welfare of his family would never be in jeopardy with him being at
the helm of the movement, and we brought resources, and it was my task
to direct all that, watching the kids grow, put money aside for their
studies, to take care of Coretta, to make sure she had every convenience
at her disposal to go, come while her husband was incarcerated.

So the intimacy of that experience was something that I had become
accustomed to, and when Dr. King was murdered, I was in Atlanta in their
home, and we separated ourselves from others who were there in the
living room, and she said, “Would you come with me.” We went into the
bedroom, and she said, “Help me select the clothes that I must -- we
must dress him in.” And it was a very private and a very remarkable
thing to – the intimacy of it with her. And as we were selecting the
suits and the shirt and the tie and laying it out, she sat on the bed,
and she kind of – a place where she had slept so often with her husband,
and all those memories. And I said, “What is it?” She says, “You know,
I'm worried about where this is all going. I'm worried about the nation,
the rage, the anger, and I need to know what to do.” And we talked for a
second. Then I said to her, “You know, at this very moment in Memphis,
thousands of sanitation workers are on hold, because Dr. King was
supposed to have been there tomorrow to lead that movement and to speak
to the people, and before your husband, our leader, is put in his grave,
if you have the will and the capacity to go down there tomorrow and
stand up before those workers and let the world know that the movement
has not been interrupted, that the process continues, and that all of
us, as strong or as weak as we may be, will step into the breach and do
what must be done.” And she did, and she went down, and she spoke, and
we came right back.

Now, all through the years since then, the building of the King Center,
many choices of things that she made to do, because she was in her own
right very involved for Dr. King. She was one of the – she was very,
very committed to the peace movement, and as a matter of fact, in
Europe, during the assassin-- the missile crisis and whatnot, we gave --
we put on a peace concert for 250,000 Germans in Cologne, mostly
students, and the moment when Coretta King -- I called and asked her to
come to speak. It would mean a lot to the young people there. She came,
and I have never, ever heard a declaration of approval like those young
German youth did when she came, and she had a sense of her own power.
She had a sense of her own capacity to bring influence and to be revered
for the work she did.

When she died, none of us knew that she was in Mexico, that she had -- I
knew that she was ill. I knew about the heart attack, the defibrillation
and the stroke. But – and I knew she had cancer, but I thought the
cancer was contained, and when she went to Mexico, she was there with
her children, and I got the news completely without knowing any of the
details, so for a few days we didn't know what was happening. Where is
she? Who’s bringing her home? When is the funeral? When is the this,
when is the that?

And finally, I left a call -- I left a message on the phones of the
children, saying, “Please give me a call. I know this is a difficult
moment, but there are things that must be done, and I would like to help
if I can.” I was then called a day later and told that, yes, that it was
on that Tues-- this was on a Friday, Friday evening, that the funeral
was going to take place that Tuesday, and that it would start at noon,
and that with all the people that were being invited, that it was -- I
was to be one of these people delivering the eulogy, and that my time
would be at somewhere around 12:30 or 1:00, and I said, “Fine.” And
knowing this, I began to put my thoughts together.

That Saturday, Bush declared he was coming. He would be there. That
Sunday, I began to change my speech, not to be rude or to be attacking,
but to integrate this moment into what needed to be said. And then, that
Monday morning, I got a call, and I was told that the invitation that
had been extended to me had been pulled. I was uninvited. A woman by the
name of Skinner and a Reverend by the name of Lawrence was the one who
called me to tell me that I was uninvited, and when that call came, I
called and spoke to one of the children. They said, these are the
events, and I need to be counseled as to how this has come about, and I
was told that I would get a call shortly, and it would all be clarified.
And then, when the final call came, it was -- they were sorry, but the
invitation – the withdrawing of the invitation would stand and that if I
came down, they would find a place for me in the church, but I would not
speak. And I did not go at all. I did not know how to deal with that.

What struck me was on the day of the ceremony, I saw how the altar was
adorned. I saw who sat there, and as the camera moved about, I saw who
was sitting in the audience, and I saw all of the power of the oppressor
represented on the stage, and all those who fought for the victories
that this nation was experiencing and enjoying sat in the outhouse, sat
out in the field, sat removed, and if it not been for Lowery, for
President Carter and for Maya Angelou, we would have had no voice and no
representation at all.

Some ministers who were quite angry at all of this said, “Come on down
here. Let's -- let's -- We have to talk to the press,” and I said, “Talk
to the press about what?” “About this. We cannot let it stand.” I said,
“I don't think that's appropriate. These are the children of my friend.
These are the children of the movement. Where did we let them get
caught? Why was Bernice giving this kind of sermon? How did you let
Reverend Long become the minister of choice? Why wasn't it at Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached? And before we go public and
begin to vent our anger, let us understand what role we played in this
capitulation that has led to this moment, and let us try first to repair
it rather than to go into public discourse.

When do we sit in a circle of healing? When we begin to talk about
getting back to where we lost stride. How do we fix this? Not how do we
play the vanity game, and get off on going public and talking about how
I was crucified. You know, it’s what it is, and there is a way in which
we have to do this that not only prevents – I don’t know that there’ll
be another moment quite like that, because Dr. King and Malcolm X and
Fannie Lou Hamer, folks like that were so rare that to be a part of the
final ceremony of their departure is a rare moment in history, but I
think that it goes along with what I have been saying here. What role
have we played in letting all this happen? Where were we? What were we
doing that had us so distracted? How can it be this way? How did you
priests and ministers let the evangelical rightwing Christian forces
co-opt the greater truth about Christianity and the philosophy of
liberation? And how did you all let that happen, and where are your
voices in opposition publicly?

Everybody has a part in this. Everybody has something to look at, and I
think it is a collective experience, and that's why I think rather than
sitting here drifting, we’ve got to talk about this, not just where we
failed and where you failed, and we’ve got to come out of this discourse
and this discussion, not just talking about it but saying, “Here's where
we go,” and take courage in the fact that we can turn this around,
because the truth of the matter is we are the only ones that can turn
this around. Nothing and no one else can do it. Nothing.

Mr. Joris,

I have no idea how you can equate an anonymous person
sending you a harsh email with people trying to Shove
Your Head In The Sand.  You do not report any threats
to your livelihood or safety in this email; its
writer(s) is/are fierce, as you are fierce in writing
of a "cynical, imperialist and repressive" Zionist
entity.  This is just like the Ishaq post I once
responded to that said that Zionists are wicked snakes
who use nasty language towards their adversaries.

The email to you, to be sure, contains both possible
and entirely dubious claims.  The nature of the
International Solidarity Movement may be as your
aversary claims; the destruction of the houses R.C.
intervened upon may have something to do with
terrorist tunnels, or may not.  She may or may not
have been visible to the driver. I see that Amnesty
International has said that there should be further
investigation of the incident.   But I don't recall
any statement anywhere before saying that Rachel
Corrie had "chosen to lay down" in front of the
vehicle--that characterization of her posture sounds
like pure propaganda.

There is SO MUCH propoganda around these issues.
Pretty much all persons speaking out of late on this
list have been tripping over each other to express
Complete Support of the Palestinian fight against "The
Occupation", but the problem is, would ending the
occupation of lands won by Israel in the '67 war ever
be thought of by the Palestinian people as an adequate
concession by the Israelis?  The Barak/Arafat/Clinton
negotiations at Camp David and Taba, and the bizarre
breakout of the Al Aqsa Intifada at that time, show
that it is a lot stickier than that.

Back to people trying to shove each others heads, etc.
 I'm against things like the recent successful
pressure on a British architect to recant his
"anti-Israeli wall" views on the Middle East and his
associations before being "allowed" to work on a
building in New York City named for the late
pro-Israel senator Jacob Javits.  (As I am  also
against the resolution by British academics at certain
institutions to break off all contact with Israeli
academics).

Thank God, Mr. Joris, that, as opposed to the
architect's situation, no one has bothered you about
your Paul Celan translation and editing projects in
light of your views so different than those of Celan,
who found pride and renewal in his visit to Israel.
But this in fact has seemed a dissonance to me, and I
have preferred to buy and read other books on Celan
than yours.

Unanonymously,
Stephen M. Baraban

And so you miss some wonderful translations that reignited Celan's poems for
me - that seems a shame. Politics and art are often an uncomfortable fit;
surely Pound demonstrates that it's hard to judge one by the other.

Palmer was one of a group of young men who regularly met with Blake in
his later years.  If I'm not mistaken--Palmer was also a versifier, but
not in the visionary mode of his great friend.  I love Palmer's visual
work!  Ebay sometimes sells his original prints at reasonable prices.
Jess, back from America, and mighty glad of it.

Thinking of Blake, Palmer, and the Ancients brings up the question of
illuminated books in the Blake mode.  This past summer I had a chance to
see an exquisite Susan Bee/ Jerome Rothenberg collaboration.  Who out
there produces illustrated, illuminated--painted or
otherwise--bookworks?  I'm quite familiar with Xeroxial Editions, so no
need to mention it.  Any others?  Jess

Some things I thought you might be interested to know....

James Wagner's Trilce is now available for your reading pleasure. The 77
poems in James Wagner's Trilce are homophonic translations of César Vallejo’
s book of the same name, or at least that was the cathartic process Wagner
underwent—in creating them, his versions take on a life of their own. Read
and listen to some online samples, as well as what Rosmarie Waldrop and
Michael Burkard have to say about Wagner's Trilce, here:
http://calamaripress.com/Trilce.htm

You can get yourself a copy of this Trilce directly from Calamari Press, or
from Powells: http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=1-0977072320-0

To celebrate the release of his new book, James Wagner will be coming out to
NYC for a whirlwind weekend of readings. April 29 at 2 PM he will be at the
Tarpaulin Sky/Frequency Series at the Four-faced Liar. Later that evening at
7 PM, he will be at Pete's Candy Store in Brooklyn. Then on Sunday April 30
at 7 PM, he will be at the Lungfull series at Zinc bar.

Other Calamari Press news:

*** Upcoming on Sunday, March 26 at 4:30 PM : Using images from the
exhibition Shoot the Family as a backdrop, Peter Markus will be reading at
the Cranbrook Art Museum in Bloomfield, Michigan. More info:
http://www.cranbrookart.edu/museum/lectures.html

*** Upcoming on April 5-7, Calamari Press & Sleepingfish will be at the &NOW
Literary Festival in Chicago. Peter Markus, Steve Timm and Michael Peters
will be reading/performing and artwork & books will be on display. More
info: http://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/programs/engl/andnow/

*** Pseudo reviews of James Tate, Aase Berg and Lara Glenum in the guise of
Inverse Anthropomorphisms and Animistic Animals were recently posted on
5¢ense Reviews: www.5cense.com

*** New stuff on the horizon:  the next issue of Sleepingfish (for which we
will be reading submissions for until April 1st), a new book by John Olson,
a re-release of Peter Markus's Good, Brother, and a new book by yours truly
if I can get my act together.

Hope you have the time to check some of this stuff out. Thanks,

Subject:      a new essay on Visual Poetry, by Karl Kempton
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with a new essay by Karl Kempton, "VISUAL POETRY: A
Brief History of Ancestral Roots and Modern Traditions".

From the Introduction, by Karl Young:

"In surfing the web today, you have probably passed through at least a
dozen examples of word and image working together. Stated another way,
you have been observing the results of prophecies and examples from
the earliest petroglyphs to the visual poets who distributed their
work through the mail art network when other avenues of publication
were closed to them. Given changes in communications technology, it
seems unlikely that visual poets will ever again be shoved back into
the position of the Haitian boat people of American poetry. At the
present moment, the interaction of graphics and text is so pervasive
in society that you can find it in everything from warehouse tracking
systems to the most sophisticated medical diagnostic techniques. Given
the now ubiquitous interrelation of word and image, it would be absurd
to imagine that a new generation of poets could be kept from exploring
this interface of media. And it would be tragic if their predecessors
would continue to be excluded from serious consideration."

Enjoy,
Dan

I'd say Mr Joris doesn't have to _report_ any threats when you're so willi=
ng
to make one in nearly the same breath as you say he doesn't report any. Is=

this what it's come to in academia: threats to refuse to read one anothers=
'
work when you think you may disagree with one another politically? Yeah,
right, that's real mature, real scholarly, isn't it.

The proper response to words is more words, not an attempt to cut the
other person off. Oh, I realize that there's a certain excitement in banni=
ng
people from lists, in refusing to buy or read their books, in cutting them=

dead in the faculty lounge, and the like. But how childish! How anti-
intellectual! How dumb.

My son Daniel Nemet-Nejat, who is a film maker and writer, has started a new
blog on film and other media. I think it contains interesting things and is
worth looking into:

http://40yrsinthedesert.blogspot.com

His last entry, an interview with the director of "The Beauty Academy of
Kabul," Liz Mermin, has already been picked up by other film blogs.

If anyone has her email address, I'd appreciate receiving it. It's

Lee Maracle: On the AFN visit to Palestine


I have been a consistent and clear supporter of the rights of the
Palestinian people to their homeland free of Israeli occupation and
annihilation since 1972, so it was with much shame and chagrin that I
read that the AFN sent a delegation to Israel, to commune with the
Israelis and to share culture, language, religion, tradition and values.
... Just exactly what values is the AFN sharing with the
Israeli’s?...Canada was a gift from Britain to the white male settlers
of Canada who cleared the land, killed the Indians and Buffalo in
exactly the same way that Israel [was a gift from US and Britain to the
European Jews] has cleared the land of Palestinians, expropriated their
villages, farms and murdered all those who resist. ...
Dear Friends

Following is a letter sent to the AFN by a long time friend, Lee Maracle.

Lee is an indigenous activist who supported the Palestinian struggle
since the 1970's. She shared the same platform with Mahmoud Darwish and
Shafiq Al-Hout at a meeting we organized in 1976 during the UN Habitat
Conference in Vancouver.

Lee is of Salish and Cree ancestry and a member of the Sto:loh Nation,
and is the author of critically acclaimed "Ravensong", "I am Woman",
"Bobbi Lee-Indian Rebel", "Daughters are Forever" and the poetry
collection "Bentbox".

On the AFN visit to Palestine

By: Lee Maracle



I have been a consistent and clear supporter of the rights of the
Palestinian people to their homeland free of Israeli occupation and
annihilation since 1972, so it was with much shame and chagrin that I
read that the AFN sent a delegation to Israel, to commune with the
Israelis and to share culture, language, religion, tradition and values.
What a shock! First, this is tantamount to laying a wreath at Vorster’s
grave in the interest of [honoring apartheid] or traveling to the U.S.
to share the values of the Custer Committee celebrating the massacre at
Wounded Knee. Just exactly what values is the AFN sharing with the
Israeli’s?



It does not take too much historical digging to find out that Israel is
the newest colonizing settler state in the world, that it displaced
several million Palestinians, corralled them into refugee camps and
denied them the basest of human rights. Hunger, displacement from their
homelands and lack of medical care all dog the Palestinian people: the
original citizens of Palestine.



Canada was a gift from Britain to the white male settlers of Canada who
cleared the land, killed the Indians and Buffalo in exactly the same way
that Israel [was a gift from US and Britain to the European Jews] has
cleared the land of Palestinians, expropriated their villages, farms and
murdered all those who resist. Both settler populations had an
obligation to dispossess and oppress the Indigenous people to maintain
the settler regime. Both sets of people have done so. Does Mr. Fontaine
imagine that he is essentially a Euro-settler, one of Custer’s boys or
is he fulfilling a puppet role for Canada in the same way that Israel
serves the oil interests of the United States?



The traditional values we hold dear are freedom, the end of oppression
and justice for all. We have demonstrated these values as Indigenous
people [the Leonard Peltier Defence Committee, the Native Study Group,
Red Power advocates and Native Youth Movement in the past have all
engaged in anti-colonial activism] supporting Mandela in his struggle
against apartheid, the Palestinians in their struggle for liberation and
Native people in our struggle for Self-determination. We want to assure
the “Indians of the middle east” that we will continue this support
despite the bizarre behavior of the AFN puppets.



see also:

We were heartened by the response of our indigenous brothers and sisters
and their organizations, who identified with the plight of the
Palestinian indigenous people. We were also gratified by the support of
our Jewish brothers and sisters and some of their organizations, who
opposed the war crimes and atrocities Israel is committing in their name
against the people of Palestine. -- "Open letter to the Assembly of
First Nations"

and


We are sorry that we do not have the means to take you on similar tours
to show you what is really happening in Palestine. Perhaps you should
ask the hundreds of international volunteers, including Canadians, who
paid their own way to go there and bear witness to the continuous
Israeli brutality against the indigenous people of Palestine -- "Final

G'day, all. I'm an Australian poet new to this list, but a veteran of
'poetryetc' and so, and extensively published here, with six books out, etc.
I've been a bit of a stick at home for the last sixty odd years, but now I
am going to visit England in May and have a number of readings lined up
around my young son's wedding. I would be very glad of some other gigs if
possible (partly to convince the local Arts dept to fund me!).

Recent poems at http://walleahpress.com.au/31.html and Issues 30 and 29
(just change the number in the address). Old poems at my stale website
http://www.bam.com.au/andrew

My CV is available to anyone who should ask, and the general tenor of my
being is exposed on my blog at http://hispirits.blogspot.com/

Books in tiny editions, done by the poet and illuminated by the poet in
much the same way as Blake worked...I'm doing this myself actually.
Have just finished a book that I've been working on and off on since
1983.  The "base" of the book was xeroxed from the original on thick
paper stock.  I then used water color and colored pencils to fill out
the images.  The book's titled The Sleeping Circus and Other Poems.  I
have yet another on alchemical themes that I've almost finished.  Jesse

Just happened on this post, so apologize if outta turn, as they say. There is no freedom of speech in China, and to compare China to the US is pure ignorance and simply political nonsense. One gets used to not thinking or saying things. Additionally, freedom of speech and press are really a byproduct of Western liberalism, which is not in China (as China has consistently maintained a fuedalistic system). If the post began differently, then might someone repeat it. I have lived in China for 4 years and do still live in China. Oh, and there is no court system in China, so you disappear (as matter of policy, rather than, say, the perversity of a president). And as far as controlling dissent, Mr. Hu is responsible for putting down a Tibetan uprising in the 1980s.

Call for Submissions

Cornrows, Double-Dutch, & Black Girl Blues:
Words and Images of Black Girlhood in America
Photos by Delphine Fawundu-Buford
Edited by Ibi Aanu Zoboi



 From sitting in between Mamaâ€™s legs holding a jar of grease while she
plaits your hair to confronting that new girl at the playground because
she was talking about you behind your back, Cornrows, Double-Dutch, &
Black Girl Blues will spark the tender memories of girlhood shared by
black women across the country.  No Shirley Temples and pink laden tea
parties here; just sassy attitude, big bold smiles, beautiful brown
skin, all rhythm, and sometimes blues.  The words will evoke the
preciousness and fragility of a black girl, while reminding you of the
resilience and determination of a proud, budding black woman.  The
images will make you wonder at the magic of a black girlâ€™s rhythm, the
precision of the intricate lines, twists, and turns of her cornrows, and
her swift agility as she skips to each beat of the telephone wire jump
rope hitting against the concrete sidewalk.  The collection will move
you to tears as you realize the challenges that black girls in America
face, from poverty and violence to negative stereotypes and lack of role
models.

Cornrows, Double-Dutch, & Black Girl Blues will feature the beauty, the
innocence, and the charm of African American girls.  The interviews,
essays, stories, and poems will be reflections of women looking back on
their girlhood days, girls capturing their own essence, and elders
advising their daughters on the importance, the dignity, and the spirit
of a black woman in the making.

The editor seeks submissions that speak to the experience of the black
girl aged 7 through 12 in America.  Currently, this is a closed
invitation to women who either work closely with young black girls or
writers who can contribute an intriguing memoir.  Once we have secured a
publisher, an open call will be sent out to young girls across the
country to submit short poems.

Topics should include, but are not limited to:

â€¢  Playground Culture: rope games (â€œJack Be Nimbleâ€, â€œAll In Togetherâ€),
hand games (Uno, Dos, y Trece mispronounced), hopscotch, confrontations,
and fights (one-on-one or the ever so taboo â€œjumpâ€).
â€¢  Sunday Best: frilly party dresses, Easter bonnets, and patent leather
Mary Janes and fold over socks with the laces at the fringes (you just
knew you were too cute!).
â€¢  Bows, Clips, & Bobos: girlhood hairstyles and accessories (colorful
plastic barrettes, bows that were burnt at the ends so they donâ€™t fray,
and bobos or bubbles that you pulled out from their bands to use them as
marbles), hair grease brands (did DAX really get your hair to grow to
your shoulders?), wooden brushes (it sure hurt your knuckles when you
got hit with it for touching your hair before it was done), and the
array of combs with the gunk between the teeth from all that grease.
â€¢  Brown Sugar and Hot Spice: sweet sayings and harsh words from
mothers, grandmothers, and teachers.
â€¢  Honey, I Love: first crushes and famous heartthrobs (Smokey Robinson,
young Michael Jackson, New Edition).
â€¢  I Am My Sista: images and characters of black girls in the media
(Penny, a very young Janet Jackson on â€œGood Timesâ€, Dee from â€œWhatâ€™s
Happeningâ€, Rudy from â€œThe Cosby Showâ€).
â€¢  Sister to a Sista: best friends, betrayals, bullies, & backstabbing.
â€¢  Blossoming: the onset of puberty, fascination with budding breasts,
first period, and discovering sexuality.
â€¢  Daddyâ€™s Little Girl: memories of daddy, the absence of a father
and/or a grandfather, or the presence of uncles, stepfathers, or mommyâ€™s
boyfriend.
â€¢  Grandmaâ€™s Hands:  memories of and the relationship with Grandma.
â€¢  Mama Says: girlhood memories of and the relationship with Mama.

more than 1 page.

We want to hear your story.  Poems should address one of the topics

general.  Pieces that pinpoint a specific aspect of black girlhood are

I'm reading Camus' "The Stranger" and see very distinct parallels with The =
Cure's "Killing An Arab". The reason why I say this is not because of the o=
bvious fact that both are about the killing of an Arab but that the lyrics

Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

remind me of what Meursault constantly says "...but that didn't mean anythi=
ng"

I've pasted the lysrics below.

Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound
I=92m alive
I=92m dead
I=92m the stranger
Killing an arab

I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

I=92m alive
I=92m dead
I=92m the stranger
Killing an arab

I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
The dead man on the beach

I=92m alive
I=92m dead
I=92m the stranger
Killing an arab

Smith is an acquaintance of mine - the bass player Simon is an old

having been told so by the author directly.

natural flattery to take

the process of seeing and processing
scene things. Once, we were a model

fox in the distant field; a sworn-in
spec mystery of mythical, fable-found
meaning. It looked (sexless), tried
to sniff the airs potentials, but failed and
I think, sighed (maybe not).

Foster the cause that saddens our shadow
weve just the time too.
But what (kind) weight put us in our place
the day you said youd donate your soul to
this signed space? Ive (still) sat and traced

Atticus/Finch is honored to present, after much anticipation, our
seventh chapbook: Lisa Jarnot’s Iliad, Book XXII. As has always been
the case in American history, there’s much to be learned from Homer’s
tale, and, as most of you are already aware, Jarnot’s treatment makes
this story all the more salient. Crisp, cutting lines turn one after
the other as she paces Achilles’ race after Hector! The pathos! The
tragedy of force and the hysteria of its telos! And the similes here
are truly epic—short blasts balanced on the music of the line, holding
still (i.e. buzzing, energized, polysemous (read: rest)). All in a
single, thick (some 50 pages!), elegant edition (every damn book
meticulously made by my own two hands!)! Don’t sleep: the entire A/F
back catalog is sold out. This one will go fast, so get out an
envelope and cut a check!

Dick Cheney writes of Jarnot’s project:

Homer’s Iliad succeeds in expressing to the millions who “just don’t
get it” why we noncombatants owe gratitude, honor, and life pensions
to those who go to war on our behalf. The book is visionary:
for “Helen,” read “weapon of mass destruction;” the rest falls into
place. Bravo to the brave soldiers, and let’s hope it doesn’t take
them ten years to get back.

Visit www.atticusfinch.org to take a peek at the cover and read sample
poems from the book (click on the book’s title for all the details).

These books will not be available in your local bookstore, nor will
they be carried by SPD (though we LOVE SPD!). These books are mail-
order only. Let’s meet square in the middle: I make the books by hand,
you order by hand. I like seeing drawings, pictures of the kid,
creative packaging, but mostly, I like hearing a voice in the upper
limit of your handwriting! From composition and production to
ordering, each one of these books has passed through loving and
careful hands!

Here is just one case

R

Country/Topic: China
Date: 15 December 2004
Source: Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
Person(s): Liu Xiaobo, Yu Jie
Target(s): writer(s)
Type(s) of violation(s): detained , questioned , released
Urgency: Bulletin
(CPJ/IFEX) - The following is a 14 December 2004 CPJ press release:


CHINA: Two leading writers and advocates detained and released

New York, December 14, 2004 - Two prominent writers and defenders of
imprisoned journalists in China were taken from their homes yesterday,
Monday, December 13, and interrogated about articles they had written for
overseas Internet sites. Liu Xiaobo and Yu Jie were released this morning
after being warned to stop writing reports critical of the Chinese
government.

"The detention and interrogation of Liu Xiaobo and Yu Jie demonstrates the
Chinese government's willingness to target high-profile intellectuals in an
effort to stem the expression of dissent," said CPJ Executive Director Ann
Cooper. "These two writers have not only fought to express their own ideas
but have also supported other writers who are harassed, censored, and
imprisoned in China."

Officers from the Beijing National Security Bureau took Liu Xiaobo and his
wife, Liu Xia, from their home in Beijing in the late afternoon of December
13, according to the Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN.
Security police arrived at the house of Yu Jie shortly thereafter.

The two writers were detained on suspicion of "endangering state security."

Released today, Yu told Reuters that police appeared to be preparing a case
against him. "They said my essays attacked the Communist Party, the
government, and the leadership and seriously violated the constitution," Yu
told Reuters.

Police asked Yu to sign and fingerprint copies of his articles printed from
the Internet and released him only after copying all documents from his
computer, according to international news reports.

Yu and Liu are founding members of the Independent Chinese PEN Center, which
advocates for the release of imprisoned writers, poets, and journalists in
China.

Yu is a prominent writer whose fiction, social criticism, and political
commentary have been banned in China. He was one of six intellectuals who
recently drafted a proposal that Mao's corpse be removed from the mausoleum
in Tiananmen Square.

Liu, president of Chinese PEN, is a leading activist and writer who was
imprisoned in the 1990s after he was accused of serving as an organizer in
the democracy movement of 1989. He recently posted articles online
advocating for the release of imprisoned poet and journalist Shi Tao. Liu
was also an outspoken defender of Internet dissident Du Daobin, who was
released from prison earlier this year.

The detention of Yu and Liu follows a pattern of harassment of intellectuals
and journalists in China that has intensified since President Hu Jintao
consolidated his leadership in the Communist Party by assuming command of
the military in September.

Just happened on this post, so apologize if outta turn, as they say. There
is no freedom of speech in China, and to compare China to the US is pure
ignorance and simply political nonsense. One gets used to not thinking or
saying things. Additionally, freedom of speech and press are really a
byproduct of Western liberalism, which is not in China (as China has
consistently maintained a fuedalistic system). If the post began
differently, then might someone repeat it. I have lived in China for 4 years
and do still live in China. Oh, and there is no court system in China, so
you disappear (as matter of policy, rather than, say, the perversity of a
president). And as far as controlling dissent, Mr. Hu is responsible for
putting down a Tibetan uprising in the 1980s.

Thanks to Alison & Marcus for responding to Stephen Baraban's "Mr. =20
Joris" post.

I've been too busy elsewhere to do so myself, but just wanted to =20
quickly suggest that I don't see a profound differecne between =20
Baraban's and the anonymous posts he tries to address: it is only a =20
difference of rhetoric and style, a sort of good cop, bad cop =20
routine, with the ideological stance behind it being essentially the =20
same.

Allison,

Thank you for your post, because you seem to
understand what I said in the spirit that I said it,
And yes, I may be depriving myself of something if I
don't look at Joris's translations and the selection
he edited.

It's funny that just as I was getting ready to make
this reply Mr. Joris's own thanks to you popped up, in
which I find myself part of some good cop/bad cop
conspiracy.  Perhaps I will be honored by a post on
his blog concerning what a rotten Zionist monster I
am.

I suspect I would have prompted a range of more
thoughtful responses had I said something similar on
poetryetc, where the dynamic seem a lot healthier, so
I suppose I'll join it sooner or later, if you'll have
me.  :)

S.B.

Subject:      Corrie
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

As I was driving down to DC yesterday, I picked up Amy Goodman's show on my car
radio -- she interviewed the people from the theater that postponed the play,
and Ms. Corrie's parents.  The explanations offered by the theater were
entirely unsatisfactory -- as I suspected, they had been lied to about Corrie
(told she was a member of Hamas, etc. - which should be irrelevant to the
staging of the play but is a falsehood in any event) -- and they did not speak
with anoyone knowledgeable on the facts of the case prior to postponing -- like
PBS in the controversy over the Armenian Genocide pogram recently, they claim
they just want to provide "context" for the play, and that that will take time
(though they felt no need to provide said context when they first scheduled it)
--

Mr. & Mrs. Corrie presented quite a contrast to the theater people -- despite
all they have been through, they remain loving and forgiving people -- I'd
never heard them before, but they made a strong impression on me --

Quick apology to readers and to Ms. Karr. As has been brought to my attention, this list has already seen tough days recently and as I write poetry and whatnot to be heard, this list is meant for different outlet, as they say. The mission of this list, one can easily argue, is about more productive ahojs! Believe it or not, one does feel compelled to silence onesself given the political allegiances (and poison rings) and sometimes poorly informed political tirades presented on this list, but best one can do is to share one's message with masses -- not an elite group. Just got back to the U.S. and things do seem a bit (or like most things here - big) of a mess.

  Anyway, I was cheap inarticulate petty.
  Alex

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Epigramititis: 118 Living American Poets
by Kent Johnson
BlazeVox Books.

These epigrams of yours can barely work--
an ounce of lard in which a thought might lurk;
or an attempt to hurt dressed in a bramble
of brittle thorns that break off as you ramble.
Precise and gleaming, wit's lightning blade
Requires rhyme to buttress what is said:
One cannot stab with daggers made of dough,
Or vivisect with blades of melting snow.
It's rhyme that sets the epigram apart
And gives the snicker snack to this fierce art.
(Or at least in English--other poets may
Autopsy dullness in a classic way
With stressed and non, their feet may sharply kick
But their translated spurs can barely stick.)
Slapdash free verse with line breaks here and there
Cannot be honed to an instrument of fear,
But brings down brick-bats on the careless head
And resonates with dullness when it's read.
So the effect is quite the opposite intended,--
The offender becomes the jest of those offended:
An easy target for their japes and jeers,
A roaring fool; the sheep to his own shears.
Whitman was not a wit, Rochester was:
The rhymester wins hands down in witty wars.
So, Kent, instead of "epigrams" of wood,
Recast your lines, and then seek to draw blood.

dear Poetics:

Plantarchy is a poetry journal. The first issue features work by Tom
Raworth, Lisa Jarnot, William R. Howe, Rodrigo Toscano, Jow Lindsay, Matthe=
w
Klane, Camille Martin and many others. There is an essay on Neoism by
Stephen Perkins and a review of Betty Bright's _No Longer Innocent: Book Ar=
t
in America 1960-1980_ (Granary).

Plantarchy has been a strategic PR campaign months in the making, but the
thing has now been printed, hand-bound and trimmed in an edition of 300 -
stacked waiting in my kitchen for u to send $$ or trades. It was very much =
a
community effort, as a number of friends living in or passing thru the
Oxford area had a go at helping w/ the collating and binding. Single issues
are $10 and 4-issue subscriptions are $25.

You can purchase Plantarchy via Paypal here -
http://www.plantarchy.us/plantarchy.html - or send the right stuff to me @
112 N College #4 / Oxford, OH 45056 USA

Copies are in the mail to contributors and subscribers.

Submissions now being accepted for Plantarchy 2: Performance and
Performativity. Please send (preferably) hand-made books/journals for
review. Contributors thus far include (among others): Piers Hugill, Brenda
Iijima, Stuart Calton, Michael Slosek, Daisy Levy, Richard Kostelanetz and
Camille Paloque-Berg=E9s.

Thanks!

Thanks for posting that, Karl-Erik.

The code is very similar to early Lingo (Director), I see.

Is Hypertalk supported on current Macs?

Is the text of the novel published elsewhere?

I like your presentation. There's the PDF of the code. Also the interview
about the piece. And http://www.nisus.se/archive/iakttaga.html#hit which
describes the project from another perspective and provides many links,
including http://www.nisus.se/archive/iakttagaqt.html , which gives us
screenshots of the original interface, and
http://www.nisus.se/archive/watcher_airports.html , which provides excerpts
from the novel.

Rather than simply publishing the PDF of the code, you've created a body of
documentation around it that is important in projects like this. Not simply
because the code can't be run anymore (if that is true), but also because
such projects--even when they still run--have these dimensions that are
sometimes interesting to write and read about.

I also enjoyed browsing your site at http://www.nisus.se/tallmo more
generally.

Sent the message too soon.  I meant to add that most people use
Supercard to run Hypercard stacks with OSX, Hypercard only works in
OS9 as far as I can tell.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Last night I heard Michael Rothenberg and David Meltzer read at St.
Marks. An extraordinary reading, and for Meltzer at least a rare
appearance in New York. A shame for anyone within easy distance to
have missed it. Thae vagaries of daily life of course largely account
for any of our attendance at almost anything. But I 've noticed, over
the year since I've been back in New York, attending two or three
radings most weeks, that it's not unusual for audiences to represent
age cohorts. So, last night, with maybe 70 people in attendance,
there were no more than six or seven people under 45. At last week's
reading by Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith I was among the only people over
35. This is about typical, and not just at the church.

In my memory younger poets have always tended to attract audiences of
their peers. What's changed is the relative failure of the young to
attend readings by older poets, even poets who could be called
masters, as Meltzer certainly is, unless the older poet has a large
following of former students in the area. It seems a shame--there's
more to learn from a David Meltzer than from most younger poets.

I base my comparison on years of running series' in New York in the
70s and 80s. Reading coordinators I've spoken to recently say they
try to balance a program by age, so that the younger poet will
attract his peers. This was never a factor for me--it wasn't necessary.

I'm obviously not talking about readings at universities, where the
readers tend to be older and there's some compulsion for students to attend.

I have no explanation for this phenomenon, but my guess is that it
reflects the enormous growth of MFA programs, which segregate
students interested in writing into a rather tight age stratum. What
does the list think?

In my experience, both socially and educationally, younger poets tend not t=
o be reading much of anything besides their own work and that of their clos=
e peers and/or teachers.  They follow whatever trend is happening or what t=
hey find their self a part of, rather than performing the task of reading o=
utside of it.  They surely tend to avoid readings unless they stand a chanc=
e to socialize with the attending reader(s) or the organizer(s).

I still have a year of being a younger poet, according to Yale, so I =
want to
chime in on this one.

It seems odd to me that one of the things that poets complained about 20
years ago was that younger poets had no knowledge of poets who were =
alive.
Yup, they only knew the dead ones with books at crummy chain bookstores =
in
the mall of the middle of nowhere and the ones who were in anthologies
taught in school.

Now, it seems the problem is that younger poets only know alive poets, =
poets
who haven't had extensive publication on major presses, or poets who =
come
visit or teach in school or have books taught in school.  Can't win for
losing, this younger crowd.

With the idea of a "canon" being contested as it is, as is the idea that
some poetry might be more "important" than other poetry, and =
understanding
that one of the things that generally marks youth is a relative lack of
experience, including reading time, this may boil down to marketing,
coteries, what you think is fun to do on a given night, and what else =
you're
doing. =20

For example, it is not convenient for parents of young children to go to
very many readings.  It is less convenient for most parents to do things =
on
weeknights than to do things on weekend afternoons.  You know, if you =
held a
reading at 11 am on a Wednesday, I imagine you'd only get grad students,
retirees, and we lucky unemployed.  It is not very convenient for people =
who
do not like to drive at night / get sleepy early to go to evening =
readings.


It is not very fun for anyone to go to a reading without snacks or the
opportunity to buy some.  Have a reading in a coffee shop, and you're =
more
likely to get those under 21 and those who are recovering from some
addiction than if your reading is in a bar. =20

The local "performance poets" here love being able to read their own =
stuff.
What they want to do when they go to a reading where they don't get to =
read
their own stuff is to give the poets who read their stuff. =20

Many of the local poets here who are not "performance poets" merely want =
you
to buy their books or take their classes.  What they want to do when =
they go
to a reading is meet the people running the reading series so that they =
will
schedule them to read so that they can sell books.

So I say, different people going to listen to Hoa Nuygen than David =
Melzer?
Wow.  Or, did they want to be published in Skanky Possum, or what time =
was
the reading.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Thanks for your kind words ...

Hypercard and Hypertalk are not supported on Mac OS X but you can run
old HyperCard stacks in so-called Classic mode, that is, using OS 9.

There is another software, Supercard that some old Hypercard users
have migrated their stacks to:
http://www.supercard.us/HyperCard/index.html
and another called Revolution (which is also for Windows and Linux):
http://support.runrev.com/resources/hypercard.php

Maybe I will take that step some day ... Hypercard has been very
valuable (and still is, since I refuse to entirely abandon OS 9) also
for various text experiments. It is very easy to write scripts that
filter texts in different ways or substitute words or extend
sentences according to certain patterns.

 Catherine,

I missed the antecedent discussion, so cannot say much
directly germane to what you're chiming in on.  But I=20
may chime in on the chime, even so -- as your mention
of the Yale Series raises odd sentiments of rue.

I too was once a younger poet (in the Yale sense).
I dare say I had some acquaintance with both classes
of poetry you describe (notwithstanding not having=20
studied English/American literature per se in college,
let alone paying overmuch heed to the anthologies).
I had noticed though that both W.S. Merwin and John
Ashbery had first published their work in the Yale
Series of Younger Poets.  And I felt this to be an
auspicious or anyway likeable-enough thing.  For some
four or five years I sent in my MSS to that series,
till -- hitting age of 40 -- I'd gone over the hill.

I think it might have been the very next year that
Merwin himself (I think for 2 years in a row) was
in the judge-chair of that particular annual series.
I think in the first year of this, he selected NO
book at all -- allowing that none of those submitted
came up to his standard.  My MSS (the one or the other)
-- which it seems missed his judgeship by a year
or something -- may or may not have cut muster in
his view (he was kind enough, at a later time, to
send me an encouraging postcard about my renderings
of Omar Khayyam, another unpublished MS. I handed
to his wife Paula at a reading at the Library of
Congress, as said, in a later year) . . . .
My would-be-Yale MSS. also (possibly both of 'em)
were adorned with epigraphs from Merwin himself;
which might or might not have mildly complicated
any such judging.  But in the unluck of the nondraw,
this was a non-issue.

The moral of my story (I think) is: don't put all of
your expectation-eggs in one Yalie basket.  These days
for "publishing" I favor my own insouciant blog, having
lost imagined glories & high auspices of initiatory prizes.

But to cook     in a language stew within
one needn't always read  all & everything
tho one could well be reading something
old or new      lost or common
a single line  pondered & mulled over
instructs in things   both near & far
this side of the line (among older poets)
-- ah you youngins   wouldn't understand

Subject: Re: readings--segregation by age

I still have a year of being a younger poet, according to Yale, so I
want to chime in on this one.

It seems odd to me that one of the things that poets complained about 20
years ago was that younger poets had no knowledge of poets who were
alive.
Yup, they only knew the dead ones with books at crummy chain bookstores
in the mall of the middle of nowhere and the ones who were in
anthologies taught in school.

Now, it seems the problem is that younger poets only know alive poets,
poets who haven't had extensive publication on major presses, or poets
who come visit or teach in school or have books taught in school.  Can't
win for losing, this younger crowd.

With the idea of a "canon" being contested as it is, as is the idea that
some poetry might be more "important" than other poetry, and
understanding that one of the things that generally marks youth is a
relative lack of experience, including reading time, this may boil down
to marketing, coteries, what you think is fun to do on a given night,
and what else you're doing. =20

For example, it is not convenient for parents of young children to go to
very many readings.  It is less convenient for most parents to do things
on weeknights than to do things on weekend afternoons.  You know, if you
held a reading at 11 am on a Wednesday, I imagine you'd only get grad
students, retirees, and we lucky unemployed.  It is not very convenient
for people who do not like to drive at night / get sleepy early to go to
evening readings.


It is not very fun for anyone to go to a reading without snacks or the
opportunity to buy some.  Have a reading in a coffee shop, and you're
more likely to get those under 21 and those who are recovering from some
addiction than if your reading is in a bar. =20

The local "performance poets" here love being able to read their own
stuff.
What they want to do when they go to a reading where they don't get to
read their own stuff is to give the poets who read their stuff. =20

Many of the local poets here who are not "performance poets" merely want
you to buy their books or take their classes.  What they want to do when
they go to a reading is meet the people running the reading series so
that they will schedule them to read so that they can sell books.

So I say, different people going to listen to Hoa Nuygen than David
Melzer?
Wow.  Or, did they want to be published in Skanky Possum, or what time
was the reading.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Hi Tim:

  I am a native French speaker living in the States, writing and  published in English--I have lived in the States for now 15 years. . .  . Regarding translations, I have translated both ways (English to  French and French to English).  A few years ago, I translated  poems by Jean-Yves Masson from French into English for a reading at a  colloquium on contemporary French authors at Florida State  University.  More recently I translated a critical (so to speak)  paper on Beckett from English into French for Stan Gontarski, and he  presented at a conference in France over the summer.  I have plans  to translate a chapter from Merleau-Ponty's _Phenomenology de la  perception_  from French into English in collaboration with one of  my colleagues who teaches Philosophy at Clayton State--I teach Creative  Writing there.  Translations are, indeed, not my main focus, but I  feel that I must use my bilingual-self at times and would certainly be  interested in helping you, depending on
the
 nature of the article to be  translated. . . .

  What is the time frame / deadline?

  What magazine is the translation for?

  Who is the French author?

  Let me know if I can help you and mostly, if you think we can work together on this project.

  Best, Brigitte

  What is the time frame

My observation was based on as controlled a field as possible. St
Marks readings are on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8 pm. Both readings
mentioned were on Wednesdays. The other readings I attend somewhat
regularly are at the Bowery Poetry Club on Saturday or Sunday
afternoons. Who shows up at which is on the predictable side,
regardless of whether they have young children. The very well- and
diversely-attended poetry series I ran for three years in the early
70s was on a Sunday afternoon. There were lots of younger and older
poets on stage and in the audience.

Rothenberg and Melzer appeared to be alive.

Good of you to note the accuracy of my observation. Less good to
resent my having observed it. I'm actually more interested in
possible explanations for the change.

About a year ago I broached the subject with a young poet. He
acknowledged the accuracy of my observation, but his explanation was
that older poets don't make enough effort to advertize themselves to
younger poets. Say wha?

Do the young really have less reading time than folks my age? Not
true in my case--I have to make an appointment with myself to read
anything not task-related, and it's a common complaint. When I was
younger I read anything and everything I could get my hands on, by
the living, the dead, or the moribund. True for my friends, as well.

Some poetry is more "important" (love those quotation marks!),
especially to learn from.

I have a very strong hunch about the median age of those attending
this Saturday's BPC reading by Charles Alexander and Rodrigo Toscano.
Very few of them will have been at the Melzer. This is not to say
Meltzer good, Charles and Rodrigo bad--I'll be there, because I think
Charles and Rodrigo are fine, very different poets. Melzer has become
indispensible. Short course: check out "Brother," in the new selected
poems, David's Copy (Penguin).

I really didn't expect acrimony, and I wasn't trying to be
acrimonious--I guess I touched a nerve. Maybe others have
explanations of the phenomenon, or maybe their observations are
different. It would be nice to hear.

Or, Mark---maybe some of us were never younger poets.  By the time I
realized what a Yale Younger Poet was, that train had nearly left the
station.  I mean, my first book came out just as I turned 40.

I'm sure there are generational differences at work here, but one
thing seems not to be at issue that probably should be at issue.  One
of the saddest tendencies I've seen in some academic cw programs is
for the poets to attend only poetry readings, and for the fiction
writers to attend only fiction readings.  I saw at times a variation
on this at AWP/Austin, where one saw few avant poets at the avant
fiction panels, and vice versa.

So if we start to venture from poetry readings---and what poetry
readings are to poets is not quite the same as what fiction readings
are to prose writers (which itself needs some drawing out)---to the
question of what poets read, then I'll have to start to get irked and
ask why we're drawing such implicitly tight circles around "poetry."
Much of my formative intellectual reading was a function of toiling
over mathematics (if that can yet be called reading).  I've attended
three lectures by Ilya Prigogine, one by Carver Mead, one by Abbie
Hoffman, one by Angela Davis, and so forth.  These I rank as highly
as many of the poetry readings I've attended.

I'll say it this way:  one of the things that's always bugged me
about poets is how caught up they seem to be in writing poems.

Best,

Joe

Barrett,

After a very long hiatus of attention, I'm just lately
re-focusing on things appearing on the Poetics list.=20
So what may strike me as remarkable may be, for all I know,
commonplace.

That said, this lineup you announce sounds if not singular,
certainly noteworthy.  It's gratifying to learn the good
Alvin Currin is taking part.  As for your own address, one
looks toward its possible perusal in future.

If you or others should care to file an after-the-fact
report on these doings, I'd enjoy the chance of reading it.

cheers,

I agree with Joe, although I will add that from personal experience =
running
reading series including both, fiction readings (same venue, same day =
and
time, writers same place in their writing lives) always have higher
attendance than poetry readings.  So I wonder at this poets not going to
fiction readings thing.  They're probably too shagged out from being a =
super
attentive sole audience member at a poetry reading the night before to =
fight
the fiction hordes.  Or maybe they want to go out dancing for a change.
I've talked to a lot of fiction writers who've come to poetry readings, =
and
they say nice things like, well, you have snacks and I get to sit.  I =
know a
lot of people who write poetry, fiction, plays, whatever, and they say =
they
prefer to read poetry at a reading because they don't have to frame the
reading as much.

AWP used to -- I don't know if it does still -- run in "fiction years" =
and
"poetry years." =20

I do not resent your having observed anything, Mark, and I thought your =
post
was interesting, and have spent a lot of time thinking about it and =
replying
to it.

Rothenberg and Melzer are alive -- no argument here either.

A Sunday afternoon reading series in my view is at least scheduled to =
get a
nice age range.  Wednesday evening -- you did note that everyone seemed =
to
be either under 35 or over 45 -- I would think that the 35-45 crowd is
likely to have small children -- ?  Those at my Wednesday reading at the
Poetry Project were all about my age and Betsy's age.  None of my =
friends
who have small children were there (and, in a few cases, none of those =
about
to have small children).  Also, I had some local poets over here last
Thursday, and no one with small children could come. =20

Say you read a book a week with time off for holidays.  You read about =
50
books a year.  Since most people I know read more than 50 books a year,
*especially while in school*, and there seems to be a progression, I'm =
not
subtracting any years.  If you're 25, say you've read 1250 books, and =
all
but 250 of those have been read while you were in school (although they =
may
not have been assigned).  If you're 50, you've read 2,500 books. =20

All best,
Catherine

Now, I think it's partly a technological issue. Writers who are using the
computer are mixing with folks they otherwise don't know. Those who ain't,
ain't, which is mostly older chaps and chapesses who can't or don't have to
figure out this equipage. I see people in print and I don't see them online
and it goes the other way, too. There's still a distrust and illegitimacy
about the electronica, especially in the academic world.

What are we doing to include? Everyone is either a LangPo, WomPo,
QuietudePo, or WhatchyamacallitPo. It's a sales point, I suppose. It takes a
great deal of effort to cull community. Community in a larger sense, not
just these splinter groups.

I never knew or interacted with Rob Creeley but, after he died, there was
quite a nice response here about how this man, in my interpretation,
fostered community. Lots of folks wrote about their little experiences with
him. Nice to read, really. It seems like more of us should aspire to that
kind of attention to our craft...

I like your attitude, George. I find much the same phenomenum with the local
uni students - They hardly know poets of their own age at other campuses!
And out of a bunch of around thirty 20/30 year old writing students
recently, NO ONE had heard of Milton! I kid you not: not a single student
had heard of Milton. I sulked in surprise.

By the way, I met you in Fremantle (and Perth) many moons ago, George. We
had some beers in a pub with Jean Bedford, Aussie novelist. So long agao ...

Andrew

Dears,

Mere seconds ago we added information on items-for-bid on the announcements
page of our website: http://poetryproject.com/announcements.html
Please peruse.

We=B9re sorry to announce that Diane DiPrima had to cancel her East Coast
tour, which means she will not be reading here with Mary Burger on April 3.
Jennifer Scappettone has graciously agreed to step in, and we are really
excited to hear her work. There=B9s a great interview with Jen at
http://chicagopostmodernpoetry.com/jscappettone.htm that is well worth
checking out.

Lastly, scroll down for details on how to go to Hell.

Love,

Talk Series: Fred Schmalz: How-To/Get Lost

This talk explores the intersection of utilitarian language and poetic
language: the high rate of interaction in the city, how we practice talking=
,
learn forms of code language to order at the deli, use slang,
(mis)understand each other, listen, ask, and invent as we give directions o=
r
instructions. The talk will incorporate works by Paul Blackburn, Lisel
Mueller, Gunter Kunert, Joshua Beckman, John Cage, Harryette Mullen, Frank
O'Hara and others to explore how poems are guides, and how they may be read
as instruction manuals.

Nicely put, Bob.
But what kind of audiences  comes to the reading series that you coordinate
in Bejing?  - class, age, nation etc. I think you once said it was
wonderfully diverse (?)
Makes me think of a wonderful, sort of, story about Ginsberg circa 1962 in
India giving a reading  to a mostly 'mandarin'  English speaking class of
folks at the US Embassy. He did not read his work, but that of WC Williams.
He apparently emptied out a big chunk of the audience when he read  a
domestic seeming Willimiam's poem - I assume, maybe wrongly - of his wife
with the lines:

...he kissed her while she pissed..

Undoubtedly one of the more memorable internal rhymes in Anglo-American
literature!   If I remember the story right (told by an American who was
there and published later in an issue of Occident, the UC Berkeley lit mag)
Ginsberg was asked not to read his own work, the apprehensions were already
as such. Williams lines managed to help him 'flip it' back at them. Raunchy
beatnik, etc. (Or talk about a poet, in this case, reasserting an audience
segregationist impulse!)

But I have no sense of the limits of decorum in Bejing.

Bob,

  I think it might be useful, if not having done so already, for you to elaborate at what's been happening Wednesday nights at the Bookworm, Beijing. Nice bit of work, that. I wonder if it might inform some of the folk Stateside.

Actually, I thought about tooting my own horn a bit in my previous post
about my readings here. They are not poetry- or language-centric, which is
why I like to call it the International Open Mic. Folks can read anything in
any language. The venue is a kind of library (book-lined walls) restaurant.
The proprietor hosts a number of book talks and other literary and musical
events each week so the crowd is quite diverse in age or otherwise.

This past week's show had the highest turnout of Chinese readers since we've
started. Almost every other performance was a Chinese poem song or short
story. I was thrilled. There are some college kids, but there are quite a
few older folks. One of our regulars is an English/Welsh woman who is well
into her 50s. I routinely draw 30-40 people, which seems highish for a
weekly open mic event.

I usually begin the night by reading something by another author. It kind of
quiets the crowd, grabs the attention and allows me to share famous work I
like. It also shows onlookers that they can grab a book and read something
from it if they don't write their own material. I close the event be reading
a poem or two of my own. As far as I know, there's nothing like this
happening in China, which makes for a nice level of excitement on a weekly
basis. Quite a number of artists come together to make it successful and I
can't thank enough people for their continued support and enthusiasm.

Thanks for the wonderful story about Ginsberg!

And finally, some of us are going to read at China's biggest national poetry
festival next Wednesday, The Nameless Festival, billed as Subterranean
Poets, at Beijing University. From what I hear, it's the first time that
foreigners have been allowed to participate, but I don't know how true that
is or not. Hopefully, this and other recordings will be available for you
far-away folks to hear soon...

I'm actually quivering thinking about it so forgive me if my thoughts are a
little scattered. Thanks for asking, Stephen!

I was in Hangzhou last summer. Innocent Age Bookstore is a gathering
place there for writers and artists around the world (all ages,
poets/fiction/word lovers)...Maybe you've heard of it...Zhu Jinxiu (Jane
Zhu), the owner, was not holding readings like this while I was there.

I would enjoy news on how The Nameless Festival goes.

restaurant.
The proprietor hosts a number of book talks and other literary and
musical
events each week so the crowd is quite diverse in age or otherwise.

This past week's show had the highest turnout of Chinese readers since
we've
started. Almost every other performance was a Chinese poem song or short
story. I was thrilled. There are some college kids, but there are quite
a
few older folks. One of our regulars is an English/Welsh woman who is
well
into her 50s. I routinely draw 30-40 people, which seems highish for a
weekly open mic event.

I usually begin the night by reading something by another author. It
kind of
quiets the crowd, grabs the attention and allows me to share famous work
I
like. It also shows onlookers that they can grab a book and read
something
from it if they don't write their own material. I close the event be
reading
a poem or two of my own. As far as I know, there's nothing like this
happening in China, which makes for a nice level of excitement on a
weekly
basis. Quite a number of artists come together to make it successful and
I
can't thank enough people for their continued support and enthusiasm.

Thanks for the wonderful story about Ginsberg!

And finally, some of us are going to read at China's biggest national
poetry
festival next Wednesday, The Nameless Festival, billed as Subterranean
Poets, at Beijing University. From what I hear, it's the first time that
foreigners have been allowed to participate, but I don't know how true
that
is or not. Hopefully, this and other recordings will be available for
you
far-away folks to hear soon...

I'm actually quivering thinking about it so forgive me if my thoughts
are a
little scattered. Thanks for asking, Stephen!

thanks Mark for raising this issue --

as a younger poet in early 80s, an appearence by a master poet like Phil
Whalen, Tom Raworth or Jerry Rothenberg was attended by all serious
younger writers and fell into a must-see category.

Not sure of the change that I've notice-- one answer is the breakdown
of the older system where younger writers came into a city and were
informally mentored by poets like Berrigan, Blackburn, Mo owen or Mayer
-- it was a nore intinate system than the prof/student relationship where
younger poets felt a part of an extended family of poetry

another reason is that younger riters are working f/t and living fairly far
from St. Marks --you just can't "drop in" as one used to

in any case, I think its a loss to younger writers --meltzer was wonderful

but I'm curious to hear younger writers take on this and is this a national
siutaion

the alter koker poet

Mark,

I was at that reading also. I must say David Meltzer's reading had a
youthfulness a thirty year old can emulate. Today, I was reading his book ("David's
Book"). I could not put it down. Standing up at the kitchen table, I read page
after page -the absolute reality of every detail, the Mozart like delicacy of
the shifts of tone...

After the reading we were at the Telephone Bar. I helped David go down the
stairs to go to pee. In the john, we were standing next to each other. He
pointed to one of the "postcard ads" enlarged and framed on the wall. Look at this
old car, he said (There was another postcard in frame in front of me also).
Yes, I said, this is post-modernism. Therefore, he said, post-modern is about
nostalgia. I said, it is the past framed for commercial purposes. It is so
carefully done, he said, I always tell my students advertizements are the best
crafted poems of our time.

I Reply:

I hope this isn't true. If true, these young poets are foolish, and their
teachers frauds. When I was a younger poet, I was (we were) always searching
for poets... they were hard to find, as I knew so little. Things in some
ways are much easier these days. The Internet is a nice little tool.

I really don't know why the readings mentioned here are segregated by age. I
do know, that for the young, they desperately want to know that poetry can
be written by poeple like themselves. Perhaps they do tend to
overcongregate, I've no idea. As well, I do know several older poets who no
longer read much, if any, poetry from young poets. That doesn't seem healthy
to me.

Perhaps poets aren't the best audience for poets?

As I've mentioned before, and not to slam poetry-slammers in general, but
I've been told by at least three, and heard one say it during her open mic
stint, that they have no need to read anything else by anybody - be it thei=
r
peers or the "masters". What's inside their head is all that counts.

Mark--


  The reason that the young pay little attention to you & David Meltzer at St Marks or wherever else is because you are not fashionable. You need to wear cooler shirts. You could borrow some of mine but I am on tour with a poetic band that is making the papers, even lucipo made a big deal when we appeared in their area. Don't misinterpret me, I am famous, but in my opinion you are one of the top ten of the under 50 set, unless you are over 50 then I will need to rethink things you fucker, My time is limited, dont make make me write a full review of this.

  NYC poets have little taste beyond the herd mentality. They are poetically retarded, you need to take out an ad to make it seem that you are worth considering. A Jenny Holzer size is best when advertised in in all of the mediums that Jenny regularly used. The only reason 75 people showed for my monday is reading is that I am cool and the inventor of Flarf poetry, which is true just ask Gary Sullivan who took the idea off of me from subpoetics. As for Dave if it was not for the lack of invention, and your loss of audience as old geezers who have forgotten the value of poetry few would have shown. But for me that was years ago and at this moment we should be focusing in on your failure. Even tho you are one of most important poets of this age you are a loser! Fuck you & Dave who invented language poetry but failed to mention it.  Get a new halo of hokekiness.  Go to a rehab, start over, Love &


Be well

Hello, David,

"Fashionable" reminds me of some poem by the thoroughly retro Michael
Blumenthal about why he's never been published in The New Yorker: none
of his poetry name-drops De Kooning, Rauschenberg, or Stella.  Ergo it
is not cool and hip.  Yes, Blumenthal was kidding.  Maybe?  Wasn't he?
Hard to reconcile that interpretation of so-called "New Yorker Poetry"
with the magazine that printed C. K. Williams' "War" right after we went
to Afghanistan.  I love reading stuff over my dinner about men having
their fingernails torn out, but C. K. has also written poems about a
dying dog in Newark moaning while taking a shit, so what the hell.  In
envy him his imagination, Princeton gig, and apartment in Paris.

Fashion.  I am 62 years old and own several pairs of cowboy boots.  I am
likely to buy more.  Maybe my shoe statements are why I've never been
able to get good jobs.  I refuse to play Straight Life unless it's Art
Pepper's recording.

I'm not even in the bottom 10 of the over 60 set.  No horse, no wife, no
mustache, no book, no academic appointment.  I feel like Uncle Vanya: I
envy everyone but I don't play with handguns.  I long since missed out
on living the theme of a song I used to hear on Don Imus' radio program:
the kid singing "I wanna grow up to be like Jesus and never have to
work."  I have reconciled myself to a life not of fame but of occasional
infamy.  Though stubbornly I have not given up on publishing a first
book, even if it is an only book.  I am considering having made for me
one of those burnt-engraved wooden plaques that reads "Old age and
treachery will overcome youth and skill."

You are in Columbus, Ohio I see.  My girlfriend lived there in a state
of dis-Grace for 20 years until 1998, when she moved back to Jersey,
leaving behind the blowhard and tree-bark eater to whom she'd been
married.  Actually she lived somewhere in Upper Arlington, near the OSU
stadium and whatchamacallit...the Olatunji River?  She didn't think much
of the place.  I rather liked it.  Then again I was not married to her
husband.

Well, I guess I just introduced myself here.  Oh, sorry--I was supposed
to do that on BritPo.

I think I'll enter your contests.  Both of them.

Ken

Hello,

Having hosted both readings Mark referred to and also talking with him
about it after the Meltzer/Rothenberg reading, I just want to chime in,
if that's alright. I do think there have been readings at the Poetry
Project where the audience generally resembles the readers in terms of
age, and the two recent readings might stand out for being back-to-back
and particularly contrasting. But ultimately I'm not sure that I
believe it is indicative of a deep generation gap. The last three
Wednesday readings at the Project have had crowds of 60-80 people, and
each audience has been quite different (with some overlap certainly). I
can think of some readings that fit the description of being weighted
heavily to one age-group or another, but at the same time I can think
of readings such as Etel Adnan/Robin Blaser back in October, or Tony
Towle/Alan Davies in February where the crowds were very mixed, and,
especially in the former case, in large numbers (130-140 people at that
one). But across three years of hosting 40-50 readings per year at the
Project I have noticed as the major trend, for lack of better way of
putting it, the fact that the audiences are differing from one another
more and more from week to week. I am only speaking for this one place
that I have so much time  given to, so I don't know how that works for
other venues in town.

Ken,

How charming & amusing & interesting all at once.
Erudite + anecdotal, self-ironic, culturally curious.
In a pinch,  why not consider self-publishing?
(e.g. via www.blogspot.com).  Simply a thought.

I guess I missed the original "fashionable"-germane post
to which you reply (another David, that.  And most lately,
email's cool but web-surfing nigh-verboten at fulltime dayjob.=20
Such things are under study by the Management Committee.
Thus switched to non-digest.  Yesterday.  But, so, am not
Archivally checking.)  C.K. Williams is enjoyable.  I was
unaware of the W.C. Williams' piss reference in the memorable
Ginsburg anecdote (not yours) seen lately.
I'm 49 w/o a 1st book in print, (so hot on the heels of what
You sorta-describe), though I've been obscurely anthologized.
(That being nor here nor there.)

I've lately blogged a poem relating to the issue of obscurity
(or specter of its opposite). I call it a gnomic verse, albeit
unsure of my nomenclature.  Gnomic I take to mean, gnarly w/
some or other conceit, terse w/ some startlement.  Yes?

Was Blmenthal kidding?    it's a question
the utterance cannot be taken at  face value
the face however may have utterance value
the face and the utterance    sentimental

Cowboy boots foreclose professional advancement?
Stranger things, Horatio Alger, under heaven.

hat-tips,
d.i.=20

I can speak for myself & a handful of others when I say that I plan my month
around readings by older poets (that I like, of course) coming to
Philadelphia. So my impulse is to react to the Mark's original question by
saying it simply isn't true, & that younger poets have the same respect &
admiration for older poets that past generations had. But I don't totally
believe that either.

University writing programs have changed the ways in which younger poets
communicate with older poets. For generations, oppositional poets who were
younger seeked out the older generation through correspondence, etc. to
engage their wisdom, share work & so on. It seems that this has been
replaced to a large degree by studying with a professor at a university- w/
easier (seemingly) & immediate access, along with a sense of tuition
entitlement.

I've been to many readings at Kelly Writers House when great older poets
from the other side of the world came to read, & there were NO young poets,
only the old friends of the visitor. There are the exceptions, & it's
obvious when a professor has put it on her/his syllabus, or encouraged the
class to attend.

But while we're having the "kids today" conversation, I have a question. Why
don't older poets come out to hear younger poets- unless they're past or
present students?

I'm content to be wrong, or at least to have overstated the case
based on limited observation, if that's what I've done, tho it would
have ben nice to hear about the situation in the Bay area. And
there's of course the crucial variable of school, i.e., maybe langpo
types, for a covenient example, are more likely to attend readings by
langpo types, regardless of age.

So here's another thing that you and I have chatted about, again a
matter of curiosity rather than contention. I think the very first
reading I ever attended was in 1965, Creeley in of all places Johns
Hopkins, where I was an undergraduate. By contrast, like you my kid
was raised at poetry readings, like Dale and Hua's two boys (one of
the great pleasures of their readings is the wonderful ease with
which they relate to their kids, who are right up there with them).
Aside from whatever brain damage you or my Carlos may have incurred,
I'm curious what coping mechanisms members of  the under twelve
reading crowd employ. I'm guessing that there are a few on the list
who were dragged to plenty of readings before their time, or who
bring their kids along.

hi all,

i have to agree with frank and anselm, what mark weiss has discerned is
in no way a national phenomenon. the readings we plan in DC are often
mixed-generation. just this sunday we hosted phyllis rosenzweig with
anna moschovakis and matvei yankelevich, and this season we've also
hosted ryan walker with lewis warsh, thalia field with jessica smith,
michael kelleher with beth joselow and tom mandel. these are among the
best-attended reasons. and i'd say ward tietz at georgetown has been
doing especially well at this, given the following combinations he's
programmed this season: lee ann brown and abigail child, alice notley
and christian bok, amiri baraka and rod smith.

regards,
tom orange

Like I say, I'm willing to be wrong--I was really asking a question--
but the difference I'm talking about is that it didn't used to be a
programing criterion which would lead one to mix programs between
generations so as to broaden the audience, tho one did between
schools, level of celebrity, in or out of town. What I have noticed
in the Bay Area (I don't pretend to know the scene in general, which
is why I suggested that someone who does know it send their take) is
a proliferation of readings in people's homes, and those appear to
fit the pattern I thought I saw.

so, is this 'just' commenting on how organizers now need to mix a different
set of demographic criteria (age, as opposed to school, or celebrity)? if
so, what is sought?

Hi Mark,

Just quickly, I don't think you're wrong about the age-matter, and I
don't even know that it's an overstatement. Not that I want to be
wishy-washy on it, but it happens sometimes, and it doesn't happen at
other times and if we looked at it case-by-case some particular factors
might bear out. What I'm less inclined to believe is that it points to
an across-the-board insularity on the part of any age group, at least
in New York.

I actually remember going to a few readings and being interested. One
was a Joe Brainard reading where he read from I Remember, which is
something a kid can hear, I think, and another was a reading where my
father and Anne Waldman read in a boxing ring and were given robes and
gloves and had trainers. My father boxed around Anne while she read and
as she got more animated he started feigning taking punches until she
delivered an upper cut and laid him out. That was entertaining.  But
generally I didnt mind going to readings if there was something to do,
or if the people there were not mean or trying to get us kids to take
off all our clothes and jump into a swimming pool....

My open mics tend to attract people of various ages.  An occasional child
even.  In general, though, the age range seems to be 20-50.

mark,

i don't think you're wrong either, that is i don't doubt that you're
describing your recent experience accurately. but you're trying to
inductively reason from your own experience to some kind of general
trend, and this i think is a mistake. at least, nothing you describe
would characterize what's going on here in DC accurately at all. we have
no "programming criterion" with respect to age, but our audiences always
have a good mix of younger and older folks.

i go back to your original post: "The vagaries of daily life of course
largely account for any of our attendance at almost anything." you could
probably go to one or two readings a day in NYC, and the sheer volume
alone has to make people be more selective than they'd like. during the
busy months in DC there might be 15 readings a month that i could go to
in theory and maybe 8 or 10 that i'll actually go to -- and fortunately
i can do so without feeling completely burned out by the end. (almost,
but not completely!)

regards,
tom orange

i am a younger poet and i make an effort to see older poets i look up
to.  at a recent reading in phoenix, however, i noticed i was probably
the only one under thirty in attendance.

i've seen both sides to the issue in every place i've lived: east
coast, west coast, midwest, northwest and now in the south west where
i landed, but more often than not the reader;s peers ultimately decide
the age range of the crowd.  and class-required attendance doesnt
count for the mixed-age audiences.

but to avoid over generalization i will only speak for myself: i
certainly value hearing older poets as a way of finding a sense of
community with people interested in writing.  i think the genre of
poetry also has to do with who goes to see who. i definetly pick and
choose readings according to the styles that inspire me.

as far as the notion that younger poets might only go to find a way to
be published, the first and only time i introduced myself was to
sheila murphy and nico vassilakis, because we are on another listserv
together and had already communicated.  prior to that i kept pretty
quiet and shy, and continue to. i'm not much of a "small talk" kind of
gal 'less i gots sumpn to say.

i also have found a way to "apprentice" by writing letters back and
forth with an older poet i greatly admire.  this gets around the
dilemma of working full time and going to school full time, not being
often available to travel- and adds to my growth and understanding.

but again, i only speak from personal experience. what do you other
kiddos have to say for yourself?

Dear Nikki and David,

  Was a great treat last night. Thanks for having had me 'round and hope I did all right, as they say, somehow contributing to the spirit of something positive and informative and whatever whatnot one can hope for that might not lead to tetchiness.

  Warm regards,
  Alex Jorgensen

In the course of this discussion, I've seen very little mention of Michael
Rothenberg, who shared the bill with David Meltzer. Without taking anything
away from Meltzer, one of my personal favorites, I'm curious about the
audience's response to Michael Rothenberg's reading. I consider Michael a
strong and seriously underrated poet, and a very powerful reader.

Mark,

I was at that reading also. I must say David Meltzer's reading had a
youthfulness a thirty year old can emulate. Today, I was reading his book ("David's
Book"). I could not put it down. Standing up at the kitchen table, I read page
after page -the absolute reality of every detail, the Mozart like delicacy of
the shifts of tone...

After the reading we were at the Telephone Bar. I helped David go down the
stairs to go to pee. In the john, we were standing next to each other. He
pointed to one of the "postcard ads" enlarged and framed on the wall. Look at this
old car, he said (There was another postcard in frame in front of me also).
Yes, I said, this is post-modernism. Therefore, he said, post-modern is about
nostalgia. I said, it is the past framed for commercial purposes. It is so
carefully done, he said, I always tell my students advertizements are the best
crafted poems of our time.

Last night I heard Michael Rothenberg and David Meltzer read at St.
Marks. An extraordinary reading, and for Meltzer at least a rare
appearance in New York. A shame for anyone within easy distance to
have missed it. Thae vagaries of daily life of course largely account
for any of our attendance at almost anything. But I 've noticed, over
the year since I've been back in New York, attending two or three
radings most weeks, that it's not unusual for audiences to represent
age cohorts. So, last night, with maybe 70 people in attendance,
there were no more than six or seven people under 45. At last week's
reading by Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith I was among the only people over
35. This is about typical, and not just at the church.

In my memory younger poets have always tended to attract audiences of
their peers. What's changed is the relative failure of the young to
attend readings by older poets, even poets who could be called
masters, as Meltzer certainly is, unless the older poet has a large
following of former students in the area. It seems a shame--there's
more to learn from a David Meltzer than from most younger poets.

I base my comparison on years of running series' in New York in the
70s and 80s. Reading coordinators I've spoken to recently say they
try to balance a program by age, so that the younger poet will
attract his peers. This was never a factor for me--it wasn't necessary.

I'm obviously not talking about readings at universities, where the
readers tend to be older and there's some compulsion for students to attend.

I have no explanation for this phenomenon, but my guess is that it
reflects the enormous growth of MFA programs, which segregate
students interested in writing into a rather tight age stratum. What
does the list think?

gv,

come to tucson. we had nico there on the same trip as when he came to
phoenix, and the audience, though not large (20 or so) was definitely mixed
in age. i dont know much about the community that attends readings in
phoenix, though i am friends with sheila murphy. but 90 miles down the road
the audience at pog & chax press readings generally ranges from 23 years
old to about 65, sometimes older, with the bulk of the audience 25-35, then
a few of us from 45 to 55, aging daily. i'm just glad you are going to
readings.

Hello,

I heard frequently about this book back in the 80's ... didn't get around t=
o
it myself until just a few months ago. Evidently it popularized
cybernetics (a generation ago, anyway)...

I also read, about a year or so ago, the alleged granddaddy of the field:
Norbert Weiner, whose name gets one or two mentions in Campbell. So, for
further reading (if you don't know them already) I recommend The Human Use
of Human Beings, and the earlier work, Cybernetics, by Weiner. There's some
math to work through in Cybernetics (always a challenge for me!), but the
text is very well written -- clear, but rigorous.

Anyway, I'm always on the lookout for what I call analogues to form and
purpose in poetry... ideas, ways of seeing/thinking, in other art forms,
sciences, etc. that can help reconfigure what we do/see in the poem... "a
cybernetics of poetry" seems worth playing around with, along those lines.
The three parameters in Campbell: matter, energy, information: what are
their parallels in the poem?

... and by "poem" I mean: any matrix of words in which the
words' self-creation and self-sustenance is the primary energy, whatever
other rhetorical, expository, aesthetic or other word uses might be involve=
d
(forgot "author's ego-amplification" -- the most important "other" purpose
of writing!).

I've read this - I see it sitting on my shelf from where I'm typing now.
Is it "'well known'?"... depends on what this would mean. It's a popular
account of information theory, and similar to the type of thing that Ed
Regis writes, in my opinion. It's ok - a kind of intro, with a few
interesting reflections on language. I suppose Jay Bolter's _Turing's
Man_ is a good comparison. Perhaps Wiener's _Human Use of Human Beings_
could be seen as similar.

loved that book... read it as a grad student, and found it useful
enough a decade ago to reference in the intro to my book on things
digital... if you like campbell's book, you'll probably like anything
by michel serres (though serres is working as a theorist)... if you
haven't already, start with ~hermes:  literature, science,
philosophy~... and there's the related work of william paulson, n.
katherine hayles, etc...

while we're citing related work, i should mention too another book
that tends to get lost in these discussions---and a great take on
cybernetics, oulipo, etc:  david porush's ~the soft machine:
cybernetic fiction~ (methuen, 1985)...

I bought a paperback copy of Grammatical Man from a street vendor
years ago because I liked the cover. Never know what treasures (or
junk) I'll find that way--also bought for the same reason a wonderful
collection of Platonov, who I'd never heard of, The Fierce and
Beautiful World, including the novella Dzan, in a great translaton.

Sorry for the digresion. Still have the Campbell. Lucid, smart
translation of some tough concepts into laymen's terms that became
part of the basis of my own thinking.

I second this -- what an extraordinary lineup.  Particularly

no doubt david  became  the focus  and his reading was fresh and alive
like an old child

a total wow

michael's reading as i had mentioned in an earlier post before all this
useless

jabber got under way was also strong  long poem-sections  from i believe

3 or 4 ongoing  ms's  the last being elements about his trials with all
the floods and hurricanes

katrina the best i've heard on that   and his redwood pome as close to
great as possible

his first pome was about it seemed a love he lost  tho i didn't ask him
after

it had alot of budhha sutff in it maybe influenced by whalen
i could go on but hopefully that'll help a bit vern  -  it was a good one
 trust me   steve

Steve

I know you mentioned Michael in your original post. But without taking
anything away from David Meltzer, who's a literary giant and a very good
person, I was concerned that nobody else has mentioned Michael's recitation.
I've heard him recite and recited with him a number of times, so I know what
he can do. The material you mentioned is very powerful work, difficult to
overlook in my opinion.

I understand the discussion ultimately addressed what age groups attend
poetry readings and that mentioning Meltzer, aside from his stature, might
have been a kind of shorthand for purposes of discussion. But I didn't
want to see Michael and his work overlooked.

As far as my own experiences at readings, the age range depends on the
venue. St. Mark's does seem to attract a more mature audience than the
Nuyorican, whose average age seemed in 1991 to be about 35 and in 1995
about 25. One place in Bethel CT draws primarily people in their twenties
to the reading given by older poets. Here in FL, the audiences seem to cover
the gamut.

Thanks for adding to the discussion.

I agree that those should be mentioned in relation to Campbell's
'Grammatical Man'. And, yes, I've eyeballed those books.

I would mention yet again a book I've mentioned recently on the list: 'The
Universal Computer' by Martin Davis. Davis is one of the pre-eminent
logicians of our time but he has penned a gripping history of the computer
and those who pioneered it in relation to language and logic.

Of course, 'Godel, Escher, Bach' and 'Metamagical Themas' by Hofstadter
should also be mentioned. William Poundstone's books are also very
interesting, such as 'The Recursive Universe' and 'Prisoner's Dilemma'.
'Godel, Escher, Bach' is notable in several ways, but one of the ways it's
notable is it doesn't have anything to do with Physics. It is on the other
side of the transition from Physics to Computer Science that is navigated in
many of the books we're mentioning. Just as Physics studies matter and
energy--thingies in the material world and their properties--Computer
Science is largely the study of linguistic constructions
(languages/data/information) and their properties/processes.

What does the word "props" mean in this context?

poet plays loop-de-loop with a teeming cast of characters, or
demi-characters, women with names and families whose outline remains

where, as Britney Spears sang, while still a virgin, I'm a slave 4 U.
Margaret Christakos, a poet of labour, is in addition a brilliant =

Regarding age and readings, I probably ought to mention that not too many years ago when Bev Carver and I were coordinating the Scottsdale Center for the Arts Poetry Series, we were fortunate to feature writers and attract audience members who ranged in age from 16 though 82+. A very beneficial thing that recalled the days when I was teaching community college at age 23 and had some wonderful students who were in their seventies. For me, there is a real benefit to mixing up age groups.

  We were very glad to have Grace attend what may have been a bit atypical on the Phoenix reading front the other night, because only Grace, a fellow named Nick (who's in his early twenties), and, of course, yours truly (KIDDING) were below that magic "30 line." Most of the people were in their 40s and 50s. That may have been a function of the way in which I got the word out. I think I'd want to mine more sources and have a greater mix of people.

  I am absolutely sure that anyone who would have attended would have loved hearing Nico read. Those experienced writers AND people who are exclusively fans of writing were absolutely taken with the quality and depth of Nico's work.

Sheila, this is a very good point and one I had not thought about. In my own
activities, I will consciously try to channel the info to people from
different age groups. Good idea!

Sorry Cathrine,

but I cannot stand generalizations of any sorts.

This friend of mine used to read 3 books a day, which makes 1095 books a
year, among these books I remember she was dealing with Wittgenstein's
Tractatus that at the time brought her to an interesting series of collages=
,
in the sense that she wasn't really oriented towards cheap science fiction.
Quantifications are gross evaluations, and they should be avoided. The more
in the field of poetry.
Nothing personal against you, but I think Mark Weiss digestested a heavy
bunch of books that might go beyond the figure you mentioned.

f'shizzle, i been diss'd !

and mortified by both our posts, george

and if nobody wants to discuss the economic disparities of those who
attend poetry readings, perhaps someone might enjoy* answering the
following: are most poetry readings, (or more properly, the places of
such) handicapped accessible?

What does the word "props" mean in this context?

Is there a new language I don't know about, being an old guy?

Anny, you entirely miss my point.  My point is that an avid reader twice =
the
age of another avid reader has had the opportunity to read twice the =
number
of books, and further that an avid reader recently graduated from school =
has
usually been exposed to books mostly by that schooling.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Vernon,

I also agree Michael gave a great reading. I am at the present reading his "Unhurried Vision." As the title suggests, Michael's work works on the mind slowly, seeping into consciousness.

In New York, The Bowery Poetry Club (Segue Series, e.g) and Zinc Bar readings draw a younger range of audience.

I don't suppose they'll be reading _Notes for Echo Lake_?
Or maybe _Tender Buttons_?
Maybe they'll do _Man with the Blue Guitar_ by rounds?

Hmm.

Catherine---

I wish you had posted what Anny said that missed your point


I still don't see your point about
having read twice as many books?

are you suggesting that the number of books,
or say "great books," one has read,
AVIDLY of course, has some relation to
"wisdom with age" or something?

For those who didn't get to see Tom Raworth perform recently,
sorry.  It's like you missed The Sex Pistols, but will lie about  it
in twenty years when no one remembers if you really were
in the audience or not.

His Philadelphia reading still vibrating, is now on PENNSOUND,
or I should say is ALREADY on PENNSOUND!  Geesh, the speed!

And when you HEAR, you'll know the speed!
_http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Raworth.html_
(http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Raworth.html)
I suggest you listen to the "Complete Reading," unplug the fucking  phone,
or shut it off or whatever, let no one bother you.

Going to listen to it again, now.  And probably later, again.
Well, after Exene Cervenka's song ends...
I could never make it through Anti-National Poetry Month
without lots of drugs, lots,

Thieves of Paradise
Lets Organize Yusef Komunyakaa to Help Save National Poetry Month
By Greg Fuchs
     I have a beef with National Poetry Month (NPM) but unlike Charles
Bernstein, a poet and professor at SUNY-Buffalo, wrote for the University o=
f
Chicago Web site in 1999 in his screed against the Academy of American Poet=
s
sponsorship of NPM, I don=B9t believe that =B3April is the cruelest month for
poetry.=B2=20
     Three weeks ago I stopped into the Leonard branch of the Brooklyn
Public Library in Williamsburg. I thought I=B9d celebrate NPM in my private
way by studying the work of a poet who I have otherwise ignored. I liked th=
e
narrow field provided by relying on the small poetry selection of a
neighborhood library because it would help check my preconceived notions of
quality.=20
     I scanned the poetry section at the library and stopped at Yusef
Komunyakaa. I=B9ve heard his name a lot around the Lower East Side poetry
scene. The title, Thieves of Paradise (Wesleyan University Press, 1998),
juxtaposed with the cover art work=8Ba detail of Benjamin West=B9s =B3Penn=B9s
Treaty with the Indians, 1771-1772=B2=8Bintrigued me as a deft blow to the ofte=
n
benign portrayal of colonial history.
     The poems in Thieves of Paradise, says the dust jacket, are defined by
Komunyakaa=B9s investigation into African-American life during the
post-Vietnam War years. Dust jacket copy is always simultaneously
over-the-top and never enough. There is more to Thieves than updated
colonialism and Black life in the 1970s; there is the entirety of African
diaspora written through a down-to-earth New York School voice. The poems
raise a wide-range of issues=8BBlackness, colloquial language, culture,
gender, imperialist history, racial identity, and sexuality.
     Poetry is the perfectly suited medium to critique culture, instigate
change, espouse radical ideas, and celebrate the body electric. It is
immediate; it does in one page what might take volumes to explain in prose.
It tolerates a multiplicity of goals. It is often enhanced by collage,
cut-up, or simply jumping from one idea to the next. It reflects our vast
complex history, yet it can succinctly articulate, the basic conflicts that
have defined human interaction. =B3Dad was saying they=B9ve duplicated us/ for
eons & can read minds,/ & there are two elders/ who know where their
portraits/ hide in a cave of red ochre,/ that all we have to do is/ watch
the animals to know/ if they desire to govern the air,=B2 writes Komunyakaa.
     Without having done my homework on the subject I could easily imagine
other critics and poets accusing Komunyakaa of being anachronistic, bourgie=
,
or even neo-Modernist. He works in conflicting traditions by making many ar=
t
history, jazz, and literary allusions within a casual New York School style=
,
most readily signified by a flagrant use of the ampersand. He is not
bombastic. I can almost hear a variation of Bernstein=B9s accusation hurled a=
t
the Academy of American Poets in critique of Komunyakaa. =B3National Poetry
Month is about making poetry safe for readers by promoting examples of the
art form at its most bland and its most morally positive.=B2
     Bernstein=B9s not far off the mark, except I think he=B9s simultaneously
too generous and narrow in perception. His accusation defines the year-roun=
d
programming of the Academy not only its NPM scheduling. Yet Bernstein
doesn=B9t acknowledge that a lot of cool unofficial poetry events are held to
celebrate NPM. Also, he doesn=B9t allow that, like Komunyakaa=B9s work, the
radical potential of poetry is often fulfilled through accretion not
disruption. Furthermore, the deeper problem with NPM, and all nationally
recognized months for marginalized art forms and peoples, is its blatant
tokenism.=20
     Reading Komunyakaa=B9s Thieves during NPM I haven=B9t been able to not
think about Black History Month. Clearly, the honoring of Blacks for a mont=
h
out of the year doesn=B9t get us any closer to living in peace, making
reparations for slavery, or redressing racism. Nor will celebrating poetry
one month a year achieve fostering an understanding of alternative,
progressive, radical, or simply different forms of communication. No amount
of corporate underwriting of curriculums, documentaries, exhibitions, or
readings will bridge these cultural crevasses, not when the corporations ar=
e
the figurative, and literal, thieves of paradise.
     The Academy, as sponsor of NPM, says it works with partner
institutions, including the American Booksellers Association, the American
Libraries Association, the National Council of Teachers of English, the
office of the U.S. Poet Laureate, and the Urban Libraries Council, to
provide materials and assistance to participants across the country. The
Academy provides free resources for poets, teachers, librarians and
booksellers through its Web site, including tips for developing effective
poetry programs and displays; a listing of major national poetry awards and
events; discussion forums; and exhibits featuring poems, biographies,
photographs, bibliographies, and audio clips.
     The Academy=B9s stated seven goals for NPM are
1. To highlight the extraordinary legacy and ongoing achievement of America=
n
poets.
2. To introduce more Americans to the pleasures of reading poetry.
3. To bring poets and poetry to the public in immediate and innovative ways=
.
4. To make poetry a more important part of the school curriculum.
5. To increase the attention paid to poetry by national and local media.
6. To encourage increased publication, distribution, and sales of poetry
books.
7. To increase public and private philanthropic support for poets and
poetry.
     Laudable goals all, but, to this extent, the Academy is merely a good
will ambassador to the presumed uninterested-in-poetry masses. This is
elitist and falsely founded. Actually I think more people than imagined are
into poetry. Song is poetry with music. The hip-hop generation is founded o=
n
poetry. The bible is full of it. Advertising is rotten with it, albeit ofte=
n
crappy. The important message to spread is that poetry is more than
decoration, that it is a living art that can radically change our lives.
     Instead of bringing poetry to the people, we should concentrate on
bringing people to the poetry. How? Simply through an effort to get more
poetry into the schools at an earlier stage and publish more poetry books.
     I would rather the Academy use its influence and fundraising
capabilities to organize schools to hire young and radical poets as
teachers. It can educate English professors to come to contemporary poets
and poetry on its own terms instead of merely searching for work that meets
them on their already established terms, the previously prescribed
philosophies of poetry. To this end, the Academy could help fund and
facilitate more contemporary and radical poets to speak in schools from
grades K through post-graduate. Finally, to fund more small presses that
already have the interest and experience in publishing poetry. If they
accomplish this last goal, then I=B9d ask that they persuade The New York
Times to review small press poetry.
     Of course this would mean organizing the administrators and poets that
are the Academy to change the agenda of NPM. Perhaps we could start by
writing or talking to Komunyakaa. He is on the Academy=B9s Board of
Chancellors. He teaches at Princeton. Email him: angleseyzoe@att.net. He
must recognize the limitations of national anything months. The poems in
Thieves would suggest that he would be sympathetic to this redirection of
NPM. He writes, =B3Every spring, sure as dogwood=B9s clockwork, someone hacksaw=
s
off Odysseus=B9 penis.=B2 Perhaps now is the time to redirect the feel-good
funding by the thieves of paradise toward more pleasurable and practical
goals.

I will not be persuaded that the latter is true.
All the avid readers I knew in highschool were fueled
by the drugstore racks, the library, stuff in the mail.
The reading at school was something you got done quickly
so thyat you could get at your books and magazines.

I'd like to chime in to add that I think that technology is a huge factor in
this discussion.

Consider that most younger people are immersed in
music/video/computer/internet media, which older poets lack an awareness of.
By this I mean laptop, iPod, TiVo, PDA, cell phone, text messaging, Netflix,
etc.  Even eBay and blogger are not universally meaningful terms. This has
to affect the writing process. For example, a lot of the older poets I
studied with at NYU from 93-95 wrote with a pencil, pen, or
typewriter-Robert Bly, Philip Levine, Galway Kinnell, Derek Mahon, etc. etc.
I once asked Levine why he wrote on a typewriter and not a computer, and he
said that most of his friends did, too; like Gerald Stern, Louis Simpson,
that whole crew.  He acted surprised that one could be creative on a word
processor. So if the medium is the message, well, the message has changed a
lot in the past 15 years.

Obviously the *content* of younger poets' poetry is also very
technologically aware and informed by the protocols of communication and
entertainment technology.  Geraldine Kim's book Povel is a great recent
example of this. Geraldine was 22 when the book came out.  It's like
Finnegan's Wake for the Wired era.  That is to say, it's wonderful, but it's
really wired, and the subject matter is often highschoolish. I noted this
tangentially in my review of Povel in Boston Review
(http://www.bostonreview.net/BR31.1/microreviews.html), which although
"depressing" to Geraldine (she slammed me on her blog), has become the
defining characteristic of the book for me as I've re-read it. You might
sense, after reading Povel and hearing Geraldine's bouncy live reading of it
full of "you know" "yeah" and "um," why kids don't make it out to Louis
Simpson or Rita Dove readings.

I consider myself a younger poet, by the way.  At least, I am totally
affected by the same technological influences as Geraldine Kim obviously is.


Although I think it's important that younger poets are rooted in what older
poets have done, and that their writing reflect this rooting, I think that
Louis Simpson is pretty boring. A lot of the 1950s-70s poets are kind of
boring to me, I'm sorry to say.  I find Lowell almost perfectly boring, even
though I know that I'm supposed to like him.  And someone like Donald Hall
strikes me as one of the all-time most boring poets.  I tried to read one of
his books, the cover was green, and it contained some weird poems about
baseball.  I can't sit down and read Rita Dove either.  I just don't get
anything from it.

I like slightly older stuff, like Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson,
and way older stuff like John Donne.  Of the newer stuff, I like Arielle
Greenberg's new book!  It's very smart, aware, but does not seem to be wired
to an iPod.

In closing let me say that my series in St. Louis
(http://belz.net/readings/) has had poets ranging from Geraldine Kim to Cole
Swensen to Mary Jo Bang to Carl Dennis-- and we always have an age-mixed
crowd.  Since the series is not connected to an MFA program, we draw a
number of poetry-minded people from the general St. Louis population. I
think that's an important factor in keeping the series vital and valuable to
the community.

Well, it has always been that way. The majority of young people are
more interested
in amusement than in the arts.

This made my morning.

However, perhaps there is a serious thought behind it. My theory is that
poets, being literalists of the imagination, don't have "creative minds".
This strikes me as a very good thing. It means poets can avoid all that
pious basketweaving and just get on with writing poems.

Wonderful !

So finally someone in America has realized
that poetry is a subculture and felt a desperate
need to do something about it....what could be
better than a brilliant rodeo show

And Mike Wallace reading with John Ashbery...

what a circus !

Is someone going to do something about it
or bash the spectre of a poetic April
in the e-group ?

Ahadada Books is pleased to present Don Quixote Goes to the Moon by Rane
Arroyo. Don Quixote Goes to the Moon is the seventh online chapbook
available from Ahadada Books and the third of 2006.

Don Quixote Goes to the Moon is available as a free download from the
following url:

http://www.ahadadabooks.com/

A first-generation Latino born in Chicago, Rane Arroyo is a leading poeta
puertorriqueno and playwright whose readership transcends his ethnicity.
Sometimes reserved, sometimes passionate, Arroyo writes with humor and a
remarkable quickness of association, moving with a grace that makes
seamless
use of speech ranging from the formal to the vernacular. Taking in love
and
sexuality, world literature and history and the exile's heritage of a
shifting geography of identity, he invokes remarkable imagery with
language
that is economical, fresh, and mischievous.

He currently teaches Creative Writing as an associate professor at the
University of Toledo. Previous work has included arts management, hospital
billing, a variety of odd temporary assignments and factory work. Work
seems
to be an important force in Arroyo's life for he has been prolific in his
writings in many genres.

Praise for Rane Arroyo

Arroyo's poems explore our various Americas, imagined and otherwise, in
language by turns playful and profound, and in images both surprising and
apt.

    - Reginald Shepherd, author of Otherhood, editor of Iowa Anthology of
New American Poetries

This displaced Midwest-based poet of Puerto Rican heritage turns
consciousness into a "glass skull" that reflects as "transparent
shadows"
the historic and contemporary marks of war and empire, colonialism,
neocolonialism, exile, diaspora, and globalization.

    - Mar&iacute;a DeGuzm&aacute;n, author of Spain's Long Shadow: The
Black Legend,
Off-Whiteness, and Anglo-American Empire

Erotic, irreverent, mournful, political, Arroyo's lyrics and narratives
surprise, often by juxtaposing literary erudition's and popular culture
in
the same stanza. Read his arguments, direct addresses, dream poems,
elegies,
family narrative, and love poems to experience an incisive, original mind
exploring "the square roots of restlessness."

    - Robin Becker, Judge, John Ciardi Prize for Poetry

Aaron,

I think you have a distorted view of "older" poets. There is no question tha=
t=20
most of "us" have a more jaundiced view of the internet, not sharing the=20
endless optimism it seems to project for "younger" ones. Among the=20
twenty-years-or-more younger, I could list a few who share a similar skeptic=
ism. Did you, for=20
example, see the link Amy King sent to the Lucipo list Saturday?

As for pencils or typewriters, most of "us" stopped using them more than=20
fifteen years ago (Lowell and Simpson were dead before the internet; Dove an=
d=20
Levine are safe to attack after joining the School of Quietitude). As for mo=
vies=20
and netflix. movies personally constitute the medium most affecting me as a=20
poet. As many of you read books in your room, I watch movies. My fingers are=
 not=20
arthiritic yet, nor does my mind suffer from glaucoma; so I can manipulate t=
he=20
disks I get from netflix.

E-Bay is the most interesting reference you make. In the seemingly so quaint=
=20
antique carpet business, exactly eleven years ago, I for one could predict t=
he=20
economic juggernaut the computer (consequaintly, e-bay, etal) will create as=
=20
a tool of capitalist production. I more or less know the date because I wrot=
e=20
a paper for my colleagues on the subject; as a result, one of them quit=20
antique carpets, choosing a field with a better business model. He thanks me=
 every=20
time he sees me. About two weeks ago, he told me that he thought I would qui=
t=20
the business after the analysis I had made, asking me what had happened. The=
=20
truth is I spent the ensuing years finishing the poem Io's Song and the=20
photography essay, and writing the Eda anthology, among other things.

This brings me to the subject of laptops. The last six years, every day, I=20
have been carrying a laptop from home to my office. The main purpose of this=
=20
activity has been to screw myself as a boss, stealing time, to work on a poe=
m or=20
essay or translation. Did you ever cut a teaching class to write a poem, or=20
play with your iPod or TIVo?   =20

Honestly, I don't see anything unexpected in your likes or dislikes. Now, if=
=20
you had declared in your post that you had liked both Rita Dove and Geraldin=
e=20
Kim, I would be impressed and think perhaps there is a depth to listening to=
=20
music through an iPod instead of on a radio or cassette tape. Otherwise, you=
=20
listen to music by putting one leg in the trouser at a time (excuse my primi=
tive=20
mixed metaphor), regardless the thousand you may have in the closet.

Aaron, we never met; a few years ago we had a very pleasant conversation on=20
the phone. My impression was always that you are a very nice person. I sugge=
st=20
that you read Gary Lenhart's book, "The Stamp of Class," which just came out=
.=20
It is a no splash, wonderful book dealing with the experiences of poets from=
=20
working class backgrounds (Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett, Eileen Myles among the=
m)=20
joining a group of Columbia/ Harvard poets (O'Hara, Ashbery, Koch, named, an=
d=20
two language poets unnamed). Lenhart's book is not "wired" like Povel's, but=
=20
it may clarify for you where the "stupid"ness lies.

A lot of the distinction you are describing as age/technology is actually a=20
distinction of class, PH.D. being an integral part of this class system; but=
=20
that is a discussion for another day. It is already 2:24 A.M. where I am.

Ciao,

Murat

I wonder if getting a PH.D. gives the license to be "stupid."=20

Florida visual poet/publisher Bob Grumman, and Cleveland artist Wendy
Collin Sorin.

Poetry readings/performances begin around 6:30 PM.   Refreshments
provided.

ABOUT THE SHOW

Intimidated by art galleries? Afraid of poetry that doesn't rhyme? Fearful=
 of
the image and text hybrid? Relax. Visual poetry is fun and good for you,
too! Come explore the world where words and pictures collide and find true=

happiness. Don't miss this rare treat of an exhibition: a survey of
contemporary visual poetry and text-based work by an international
gathering of artists whose work creates new meanings from words and the
spaces between them while challenging the distinctions between art forms.

These men and women are exploring the further ranges of what it means to
make art, and their approaches move along a continuum from grand fun to
the High Sublime.

Work by area artists Chris Franke, Steven B. Smith, Jim Lang and Ohio
poets John M. Bennett, C. Mehrl Bennett, will join a national and
international group which includes Susan Bee and Richard Kostelanetz
(New York City), Guy Beining (Maine), Karl Kempton (California), Carla
Bertola (Italy), Klaus Peter Dencker (Germany), Luc Fierens (Belgium),
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen (Finland) and many others. Founded in 2005, the
mission of Gallery 324 is to showcase primarily Ohio artists. Located in t=
he
Galleria at Erieview on the first floor, near the Food Court, Gallery 324 =
is
operated by Marcus Bales, a Cleveland glass artist, in conjunction with
Gary Roberts, a Cleveland furniture designer.

Does anyone recall a song by Tom Lehrer called "National Brotherhood
Week"?  Misspellings are courtesy of moronic Microsoft Outlook 2003.

A situation very similar to "Poetry Month" I suspect...  Poets as a sort
of underclass?

KW

Oh, the white folks hate the black folks,
And the black folks hate the white folks.
To hate all but the right folks
Is an old established rule.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
Lena horne and sheriff clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.
It's fun to eulogize
The people you despise,
As long as you don't let 'em in your school.

Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks,
And the rich folks hate the poor folks.
All of my folks hate all of your folks,
It's american as apple pie.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
New yorkers love the puerto ricans 'cause it's very chic.
Step up and shake the hand
Of someone you can't stand.
You can tolerate him if you try.

Oh, the protestants hate the catholics,
And the catholics hate the protestants,
And the hindus hate the moslems,
And everybody hates the jews.

But during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
It's national everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood week.
Be nice to people who
Are inferior to you.
It's only for a week, so have no fear.
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year!

I thought you were like 29, dude.  Seriously, though, how old are you? I am
34.

You're right that the generational generalizations have exceptions--early
adapters, in your case and to some degree in mine. I published a newspaper
article about eBay in 1997, which was pretty early on.  I published an
article about mapquest that year, too.

BUT I do think that the kids --by which I mean, younger MFA students-- don't
follow older poets because older poets GENERALLY aren't hip to the lingo.
They like poets closer to their age group who know and care about their
world.  They like poetry that's relevant to their experience. Don't we all?

It might be a matter of class. I'll have to give that some thought. I don't
really think it is, though.

More later- I'm racing out the door--

See, and I thought you were joking.

I chiseled this message on a stone. Had to call in a younger dude to
plug it into the computer. He said that one of my problems with the
computer was that I hadn't plugged it in.

Did you know that there are robotic thingees that can chisel messages
on stone? That would be really cool--I could do a whole edition. But
I'd have to learn a new program. Bummer.

I saw the ad for this event as well.  My first thought was that an event like this is organized to attract people who wouldn't normally read poetry because of the stars involved.  While it would be nice, in a perfect universe, to have such a reading with poetic stars instead of movie stars and the only star neurologist on the planet, I still think this reading could perform a positive function.  Of course, if it's only a fundraiser for a certain poetry establishment, then it obviously does nothing for us poets who happen to reside outside that establishment.  Nevertheless, the event could have a small positive effect if someone previously not involved in poetry becomes hooked.

Subject:      Delany conference -- words of thanks
Comments: To: ENGRAD-LIST@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Greetings everyone -

I wanted to make use of this forum to thank publicly everyone who made the
“Samuel R. Delany Critical Symposium” possible.

The overwhelming consensus appears to be that the Symposium was nothing
short of a smashing success.  Not only did the conference stay on schedule,
with only the most minor and unavoidable of glitches, but the quality of the
papers presented was uniformly high and in quite a few cases shockingly good.
All the numerous phases and modes of Delany's career got coverage, and a
variety of rhetorical approaches were taken, from standard academic
presentations to informal testimonies to lyrical-transgressive rhapsodies, all with
complete success.  The extra “goodies” of the conference contributed greatly:
the exhibit of Delany paraphernalia (which I'll probably be taking down Tuesday
afternoon, so if you haven't had a chance to see the stuff, you should scoot over
to Capen), the several multimedia presentations, the very congenial space of
the Poetry Collection room, and the evening readings downtown at the Trinity
Episcopal Church by Lance Olsen and, of course, Delany himself, which
capped the conference events.  The constant comment I heard from all who
participated was, “This is unbelievably fun.”

Chip Delany himself was simply bowled over.  He attended all the conference
events, contributed to discussion at several points, and obviously had a grand
time; those who went to his (brilliant) reading and heard his introductory words
of thanks know how moved he was by the whole experience.

For the success of the conference I have many people to thank, and if I miss
anyone, forgive me - it was unintentional.

First and foremost, my thanks to Christopher Leise, who taught me all I know
about conference organizing.  Between the Gaddis conference last year and the
Delany conference this year, Chris is simply a pro a this sort of event; he knows
all the angles.  From beginning to end, Chris helped keep things on track by
asking me questions that, not having been through it before, I never would have
thought to ask.  For all this and more, I can't thank Chris enough.

Thanks to Mary Foltz both for logistical support (catering, booking
accommodations for keynotes, and so on), general moral support throughout,
specific organizational interventions at key points in the process, and of course
a fantastic presentation.  For all she's done I feel I must now throw myself at her
feet and be her slave (of one sort or another).

Thanks to Christina Milletti for her enthusiastic support for this event from the
beginning, her expertise as director of the Exhibit X fiction series, her
conscientious tracking of the process as it unfolded, and her connections to
Hallwalls and the wider world  o' Buffalo which helped give this conference a
greater presence in the city at large than it would otherwise have had.

Huge thanks to the Graduate Americanist Group for crucial logistical support,
especially in the weeks right before the conference and then during the
conference itself.  I won't list all our drivers and people who provided
accommodations because I just know I'm going to forget about a third of them.
But I want to single out Lorna Perez for handling on-campus catering and
accommodations and Kevin Pelletier for handling the profoundly confusing job
of orchestrating transportation.  GAG was an indispensable and incredibly
reliable source of support for this event.

I give my profound personal thanks to my family and friends, especially
Shevaun Donelli, for their love and support.

For their enthusiastic support of this conference I also want to thank the English
Department, the Butler Chair, the Gray Chair, the McNulty Chair, the Capen
Chair.  Thanks to Tricia Darstein, Marilyn Dunlap, Barbara Pajda; thanks
especially to Wendy Belz for all her help - and, of course, for her help to come,
until we get all the receipts and paperwork sorted out.

Thanks also to the College of Arts and Sciences, the Humanities Institute, the
departments of History and Philosophy, and the English, History, and Philsophy
GSAs.

Special thanks to Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center and the Temple
University English Department.

Special thanks also to Mike Basinski, curator of the Poetry Collection, for his
very genial assistance throughout our occupation of the space.  It was a
pleasure working with him.

Very special thanks as well to Sean Noel and the staff at the Howard Gotlieb
Archival Research Center at Boston University (home of Delany's manuscripts
and papers) who went out of their way to help gather and reproduce the work
now on display in the Poetry Collection room.

And thanks, finally, to all who spoke at the conference.  The expertise, brilliance,
and love for Delany's work they brought to the conference made the whole effort
worthwhile.

With this conference we've done a very good thing for Delany scholarship - and
for Chip.  I shall be proud of this achievement for the rest of my life, and so
should all who helped make this happen.

Thanks.

- Ken James

barrett, thanks for this in particular:

>"Transposing the Limits of Open Form: Language Writing and Anthony Braxton"
>http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac%5Fpages/ewatten/post26.html

i don't have anything approaching your=20
expertise---indeed, i have no expertise at=20
all!---regarding the material you're covering,=20
though i'm familiar somewhat with braxton's work=20
and thought (thanks largely to john corbett's=20
excellent ~extended play~, which i picked up when=20
it came out)...

but on a first quick read through your text, this=20
para of yours in particular struck me as key to=20
your argument:

-------------------------------
=46ull discussion of Braxton's writings about his=20
music must await further reading, especially of=20
the three-volume Tri-Axium Writings, which plan=20
to gain a sense of through some form of sampling=20
technique. I cite the passage above because I am=20
simultaneously sympathetic to the genuineness of=20
his appeal to the universal ("life really is=20
something") and disappointed in the=20
un-self-conscious re-presentation of the clich=E9s=20
of cosmic consciousness that have, finally,=20
circumscribed and diminished avant-garde agency=20
at least since Fourier (a study awaits to show=20
how the traces of spirituality coexists with the=20
radical particularity and constructivism of=20
transformative modern artists like Arthur=20
Rimbaud, Hugo Ball, Velimir Khlebnikov, Kazimir=20
Malevich, Laura Riding, and even Robert Grenier).=20
An invocation of "spirit," in any case, just does=20
not achieve the level of insight in the form of=20
the work; rather, it tends to cover over or level=20
the work of Braxton's continuous transposition.=20
Here again, a cultural logic is at work: at the=20
difficult boundary of race and class, the=20
psychology of double consciousness does its=20
protective duty, so that an unprotected=20
perception of compositional possibility may arise=20
from the "language music" of the material, rather=20
than spiritual, facts of musical and cultural=20
form. Against this holism, or better as its=20
necessary complement, I would point to a passage=20
in Braxton's Series F improvisations from 1971.=20
[About two minutes from side 1, cut 5, should be=20
played now]. In this continuous meditation on and=20
elaboration of rhythmic figures, we hear the work=20
of the negative as structural elaboration:=20
distancing, rethinking, repeating, questioning,=20
materializing, contextualizing,=20
constructing-"language music" of direct=20
identificatory possibility across the abysses of=20
culture.
----------------------

it's not surprising to see you diverge from=20
braxton's own claims re the spiritual (and=20
cosmic) in his work, and it makes perfect sense=20
generally to debunk more simplistic uses of the=20
term in order to avoid consequent=20
mystifications...

at the same time, i'd be interested in hearing=20
from you as to whether you EVER think the=20
spiritual as such has a place in materialist=20
critique---which is my way of saying, that i'm=20
sure it does, and that i'm sure related terms=20
like "cosmic," while they may give us all=20
conniptions at times, can't be set aside simply=20
on the basis of what you're calling "diminished=20
avant-garde agency"... and it seems to me, esp.=20
when it comes to a discourse that hopes to=20
navigate the correspondences between music and=20
writing, that we're going to need to account for=20
how music moves us differently than do these=20
little letters...

so:  why music moves us, sure, but also, *that*=20
it moves us (not more or less---just=20
differently)... and i wonder at times whether=20
music accesses something called the spiritual=20
more immediately than do words (which isn't to=20
say we need simply succumb to same, either)...=20
recent cogsci research (here's another kind of=20
materialist insight) indicates that music engages=20
more parts of the brain than do other kinds of=20
stimuli... i'm sure we can even (as has been=20
surmised) locate the part of the brain=20
responsible for feelings of "transcendence"...=20
but my point is that if there's a physiological=20
difference at stake here, there should be a=20
discursive one as well... and again, whether or=20
not these feelings (and related beliefs) we call=20
"spiritual"---as opposed to intellectual, or=20
emotional---are mere illusions following from=20
(faulty?) brain chemistry coupled with bad=20
history, i would think we'd do well to pause at=20
this aspect of the real, if only b/c there is so=20
often a related race- or ethnic-marker when it=20
comes to how this word is used, and who uses it...

anyway---there are a lot of possible directions=20
here, as you know, ranging from a renewed=20
discussion of community (not necessarily a=20
phalanstery!) to a more individuated ethics...=20
but i think it's time that (at least some)=20
materialist critique started to look beyond=20
materialist assumptions as to the=20
spiritual---don't you?... and i'm interested in=20
what you may have to say about this generally...=20
maybe it'll prove to be a dead-end ultimately, in=20
which event, i rather think this will likely be a=20
function of how diminished our discourses are, if=20
not our agencies...

best,

joe

Um, Jesse, epigrams didn't begin in the 18th century and have not been
written exclusively in heroic couplets a la Alexander Pope, for that
matter.  Go back a little ways to Robert Herrick, and even further to
Martial, Catullus, the Greek Anthology, &c.

I guess this makes me an alter kaker too.  Antiquity, on this list!

FLARF: INAPPROPRIATE EXPLORATION IN 21st CENTURY ART

Film, poetry, music and theater by members of the Flarflist Collective in
collaboration with Abigail Child, Theresa Buchheister, The Drew Gardner
Poetics Orchestra, and members of Medicine Show, The Ontological-Hysteric
Theater, and The Upright Citizens Brigade.

Award-winning experimental ensemble Medicine Show hosts the celebrated and
controversial Flarflist Collective for three nights as part of its ongoing
Word/Play series, partially funded by NYSCA.

Launched in May of 2001 by six poets, the Flarflist Collective is dedicated
to the exploration of “the inappropriate” in all of its guises. Poets mine
the Internet with odd search terms then distill the results into often
hilarious and disturbing poems, plays, and other subversive texts.

The Festival runs April 20-22, 2006, at Medicine Show (549 W 52nd St), and
will be emceed by Jordan Davis, host of the Bowery Poetry Club’s popular
“Million Poems Show.”

THE PUBLIC RECEPTION OF FLARF
Discussion about Flarf has been broadcast by the BBC and published in
magazines such as The Village Voice, The Nation, Constant Critic, Jacket,
and Rain Taxi. Further discussion has taken place on dozens of blogs and
listservs across the United States, and in Australia, Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Holland, Mexico, and elsewhere.

Joyelle McSweeny on Flarf in Constant Critic: “Jangly, cut-up textures,
speediness, and bizarre trajectories … I love a movement that’s willing to
describe its texts as ‘a kind of corrosive, cute, or cloying awfulness.’
This is utterly tonic in a poetry field crowded by would-be sincerists
unwilling to own up to their poems’ self-aggrandizing, sentimental,
bloviating, or sexist tendencies.”

EVENT SPECIFICS

Thursday April 20 at 8:00 pm: Three Bollywood-related films (by Abigail
Child & Gary Sullivan, Brandon Downing, and Rodney Koeneke) and performance

I think this is kind of misled. All the hi tech is just so much bric-a-brac
to enable their social selves.  I write for young people (teens) and what's
more thousands of them read what I write, in some cases obsessively. I think
what they want taken seriously is their emotional lives, which leaves
obvious openings for poetry.

Murat,

Let me put it this way--I taught high school English for three years--tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth grade.  I felt like an ambassador to the kind of youth
culture I'm talking about. I imagine you would feel the same. Unless you
have 8000 songs on your iPod and are constantly sending text messages to
your friends. Unless you have never *heard* of vinyl LP records. Does that
describe you, really, Murat?  It sure doesn't describe me. Do you spend two
hours a day on Facebook or MySpace?  I mean, I feel as though I'm part of
this group, but just barely; and I also feel that it's a lot easier for me
to sympathize with younger people than it is for them to sympathize with me.
I have retrofitted myself, but I have a much longer memory and am capable of
imagining life without cell phones or email. That's a very important
capability, in my opinion.  It doesn't have anything to do with class.  It
just, I think, explain why young people *tend to* go see young poets.  Which
I thought was the initial question.

Aaron and Murat,

Here in the peanut gallery, I'm enjoying the exchange,
And learning (it seems) a few things at each ping & pong.

The ways in which technology can (in a perhaps transient
but perhaps, for a time, mentally-impressive way) seem to
define a sense of (generational or ethos-) identity, is
interesting in itself (the po-go/no-go question aside).

Reaching for similes of some sort, -- the introduction of
the automobile into pervasive culture, and of the television,
seem a couple of such stages down the techno-primrose path.

Where we're going, who knows?

And if all our toys & joys are suddenly pulled from us?
(as may hap soon or late), -- . . .
but that's a pier off which to dangle a foot, more than
a stone to leap to . . .

Meanwhile, in age betwixt you twain [49 & counting],
weird nostalgia seeps up between the cracks of this
conversation.

cheers,
d.i.

Hello Ric:

Since the mid-eighties I have been doing a long "walking". Junction Press
published the first stage, Walking, in 1993. Since then, mainly published in
magazines, I have been doing many different angles on this - poems, short
essays, often with elegy as a them. Tentatively Junction will publish a
series of five of long poem in this unintentional series,  with the title,
Walking Elegy.
Ric, I do not know your work and I would like what you are doing with your
'study' of the long poem, etc,

Ric,

For the past 5+ years I have been working on a long poem that re-enacts
the history of the town in which I live, Auburn, Washington. Founded as
the town of Slaughter, the poem is entitled A Time Before Slaughter. It
chronicles the method of dealing with the local native population, the
Japanese-American citizens who settled here in the White River Valley
and the environment. (The Stuck River was actually blown up several
times in an effort to divert its course.)

Some of the poems from the series are in Mp3 format at:
http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/paul-nelson_poems.html

Good luck.

Paul Nelson

I've been working on SAMSARA CONGERIES since '76, sprawling,
uncontrollable, 17 books, slowly putting the typescript online, I
have fantasies that there is a publisher out there who would bring
the whole thing out under one cover,  each book written in a
different voice, different style, includes songs, performance scores,
vispo, typography, found, texts & anti-texts.  Something tells me the
writing of it is nearly complete, but hard to close the cover on
something I've spent my whole adult life unravelling.

See here:

I've also started a forum on the site to compile resources pertaining
to current long poems in progress, but have not had time to add much
other than a few references to Vernon Frazers Improvisations.

mIEKAL,

I think that Vernon Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS is a work worth
referencing. Ric's and others' reviews of both its parts and its whole,
as well as Vernon's comments about his process and his own quest for
publication could be helpful.

Thanks for mentioning IMPROVISATIONS to mIEKAL, but he's interviewed me
about it You can read the interview at:

http://xexoxial.org/samsara_congeries/?q=taxonomy/term/2.

mIEKAL has also published Clayton Couch's review of the first two books of
IMPROVISATIONS at the site and invited people to comment.

He's made an excellent presentation about the work. It's very informative.

As you know, Big Bridge has assembled PRELUDE, a feature about my recent
work with special focus on IMPROVISATIONS. Interested readers can find it
at:

http://www.bigbridge.org/vfcarfagna.htm

The feature includes reviews by Ric Carfagna, Jonathan Penton, a verbal
"dance" on IMPROVISATIONS by Stephen-Paul Martin and Kirpal Gordon and an
interview by Danielle Grilli.

Reviews of the completed IMPROVISATIONS have yet to appear. When they do, I
expect people unfamiliar with the completed IMPROVISATIONS gain a greater
understanding of the work and its play between the textual and the visual.

Best,

Vernon

Jane Sprague is involved in a book-length poem, The Port of Los Angeles,
and Jen Hofer also has a long project, One.  I am about two-thirds of
the way (500 pages so far) through a long poem sequence, Atlas
Peripatetic (http://www.csulb.edu/~gbach/ap.html).

I hope folks reply front-channel, as I'd like to hear about what others

I've made this remark before but it seems key to any discussion of
long poems to distinguish between long poems in the sense of a life's
project, a writing that extends over many years of a writer's
development & book-length poems.  For instance, Martyrology seems to
be in a wholy different genre than something like Dorn's Gunslinger.

Also it would be useful to at least blurb the works mentioned to get
a better idea of what they are about....  or throw out some links to
online appearances.  I'd love to hear more about all three that you
mention.

Charles (and others)--

I'm no fan of celebrity children's books, but in
defense of ol' Wynton Marsalis, who's on your list of
"non-poets" here, he can actually write a poem. Check
out his JAZZ ABZ book (Candlewick, 2005), an
abecedarian collection that's surprisingly good.

Check out this bit from the Ornette Coleman selection:

"Ooh oozy oomp. Ow! Oompah varoom! "Oolong of oodles,"
opined Ophelia
portly opened pour posted au pair opposite polly-opals
pro quo quakkis
oak Quintana Roo quoth roccoco cue co-wrote,

"Our round droll groom drools orange o'er trolls to
trounce known knolls,"
where Homer wrote, "Nor ornament, nor orthodoxy, nor
ornithology.
Or-Or-Or-Or-Ornette!!"

Or take this horizontal acrostic called "Eubie Blake":

Everybody's urgent 'bout interviewing Eubie. But let a
king eat.

Aldon, if you're reading, you might want to check it
out.

Don't forget Vernon Frazer's _Improvisations_.

For what it's worth, I have an untitled long piece in progress. (The =
first
two mss. have been published: What Of--Potes & Poets--and At =
That--Ahadada.)

I have a feeling that the long works currently mentioned proceed on a
different basis than the long works of Pound and others. This difference
might make for interesting distinctions in terms of authority,=20
romanticism, etc.

RESPONSES TO COMMENTS AND CONCERNS
FROM 03-22 =C2=97 03-26-06
By Karl Kempton
Oceano, CA
03-26-06

Before I respond to the comments and concerns about my essay on visual poet=
ry, I want to express my thanks and gratitude to Dan Waber and Karl Young. =
First to Dan for the initial questions about concrete and visual poetries l=
eading to this outline, his observations and comments, proofing a dyslexic =
down to the final moment prior to the web posting, and lastly for the suppo=
rt of this effort and support of my visual poetry on his site. I want to th=
ank Karl for his diligence in pointing out the pot holes I missed or inadve=
rtently created along the path I was attempting to make, suggestions for ex=
pansion and contraction, information of which I was unawares (Is there anyo=
ne who knows this entire subject matter thoroughly?), and for his continued=
 support of KALDRON and my work. I also would like to thank Bob Grumman, Ma=
rton Koppany and Carlos Luis for comments on the initial draft before it tr=
ipled in size.

Again, I would like to begin with a thanks. And it goes to those who sent f=
avorable responses. Given some of the potential controversial issues raised=
, these positive comments mean a lot.

From other comments I read on the Spidertangle list and those forwarded to =
me by Dan, it seems an overriding concern centers on a statement in Karl Yo=
ung=C2=92s introduction about KALDRON being the first international publica=
tion devoted solely to visual poetry. I have no ego investment in whether o=
r not KALDRON was the first journal or magazine to do so. While other publi=
cations were mentioned, as far as I am aware they were not exclusively devo=
ted to all international visual poetries. The operative phrase here is, =C2=
=93that strove to include all modes of visual poetry.=C2=94 Other types of =
poetry were published such as lexical, experimental lexical, concrete, soun=
d poetry texts, etc. in these other publications. Other publications of the=
 1970=C2=92s in the USA publishing visual poetry went unmentioned such as A=
ssembling, Intermedia, Interstate, Typewriter and West Coast Poetry Review.=
 Unmentioned in Great Britain was Ian Finlay=C2=92s poor.old.tired.horse. U=
nmentioned for Japan was Shi Shi, mainly a concrete venture. In France besi=
des Docks, was there not Le Lettriseme? And, what about Germany? Of these w=
hich were exclusively devoted to all modes of international visual poetry?

To be exact about this concern, while KALDRON initially began as both a lyr=
ical and visual poetry publication in 1976, it became exclusively an intern=
ational journal of visual poetry in early 1979 upon publishing selections f=
rom my first curated international visual poetry exhibition, Visualog 1, co=
-curated with the able help and keen editing abilities of David and Patty A=
rnold. We also co-edited, with David and Patty designing, a special oversiz=
ed issue of Cafe Solo that published other selections from the same exhibit.

Prior that date, while I was publishing all modes regardless of group affil=
iation, which at that point was how visual poets generally were constellate=
d, I was unsuccessful in reaching wide and deep into the various groupings.=
 Visualog generated access to over a hundred visual poets. This permitted m=
e to venture forth on my self assigned effort to provide the widest and dee=
pest possible variety of quality visual poetry from all groups around the w=
orld.

So, the working phrase is, =C2=93that strove to include all modes of visual=
 poetry.=C2=94 Perhaps this is the moment to put together a list and timeli=
ne of publications devoted 1) to concrete, 2) international visual poetry 3=
), hybrids of 1 and 2, 4) to various concrete and visual poetry groups, and=
 5) to all modes of visual poetry. The initial effort could be a collaborat=
ion amongst the special collection librarians associated with these lists. =
Once a draft has been completed it could be sent to the lists for additions=
 and corrections.

Then, there is the concern expressed by Lawrence Upton, =C2=93I=C2=92ll jus=
t point out that Cobbing continued using letters / words up to the last and=
 that his earliest =C2=97 as far as I know =C2=97 surviving work dates from=
 1942 and it is wordless.=C2=94 This is commenting on where I wrote, =C2=93=
 I should point out that after the 1970=C2=92s Cobbing moved out of Concret=
e Poetry into visual poetry and beyond to wordless compositions.=C2=94

I guess, Lawrence, that I was not careful nor clear enough when I wrote thi=
s and apologize for wasting your valuable time. All I was attempting to poi=
nt out was that Cobbing did not remain a concrete poet and had moved on to =
compose in the wider fields of visual poetry. By pointing to composing word=
less poems I was pointing out to those who did not think such work, wordles=
s, was visual poetry.

Further, you had a question regarding my limited overview of the Brits. I g=
uess again I did not make myself clear enough but I wrote that I would leav=
e coverage of each national group up to its native speakers. My overview of=
 the USA scene was an illustration of what needs to be done for all nationa=
l groups.

A positive comment was made by Nico Vassilakis. He wants the next chapter o=
n visual poetry from the 70=C2=92s to the present moment. In an early draft=
 of the essay I was preparing a list for the appendix of visual poets from =
the mid 60=C2=92s to the present moment to illustrate the difficulty and co=
mplexity of covering international visual poetry over the time span he asks=
 for. The list grew to over 260 individuals accompanied with the nation or =
nations in which they resided and composed. It was deleted mainly because s=
uch a list can never be compete and also insulting whoever inadvertently go=
es unmentioned. It has been passed on to a couple of interested individuals.

It's always fun to come up with a particular shape and then fill it up a lot of times:  over a
three year period I wrote 100 poems of seven lines each (three couplets and a single last line)
calling the series "Shy Green Fields."

I also have done a daybook project: in '97-'98 I wrote a ten-line prose poem every day for a year.
 I plan to revisit this project in 2007-08, and every ten years thereafter (God willing!).  I've
published various bits and chunks of it (most of my prose poems have come from this project) --
April, 1997 can be found on the Light and Dust Books website at:
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/stinbrg.htm -- daybooks are great because they combine the
serial/sequential with the procedural.

I'm also about forty pages into a long, collagey, non-serial poem about the war and Las Vegas.
Haven't tried to publish it anywhere yet.

mIEKAL and Ric, et al.,

Jane's project, The Port of Los Angeles, involves her
examination of the twin ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles (what a tangled history that is) from the
micro/macro, as well as from the point of view of recently
relocating to Southern California from the east coast
(forgive me, Jane, for oversimplifying . . .).  An excerpt
from this project was published in Tarpaulin Sky, Vol 3 No
2:
www.tarpaulinsky.com/Summer05/Sprague/Jane_Sprague.html.

Jen's project, one, is new to me, and I haven't talked
with her about it yet, but a recording of her reading from
the manuscript for the Los Angeles podcast series L.A.
Lit, with links to excerpts from the project, can be found
here: http://la-lit.com/writers/la-lit-5-jen-hofer.

My own project, Atlas Peripatetic, is an examination of
the urban residential landscape from a sonic perspective:
each chapter of the poem is a meditation/improvisation on
one or more of nearly 1,300 sounds that I documented over
a six month period.  A hybrid daybook/catalog/map/walk.
 Some excerpts, again, found here:
http://www.csulb.edu/~gbach/ap.html.

I remember you bringing this up some time ago with regard
to long works, but I don't recall if the thread was picked
up.  As far as life-long vs. book-long, I can't speak for
Jane or Jen, but with my own project it's still too early
to tell how far it will go beyond the initial examination
of the original sounds.  Once I'm done with filling in the
blanks, so to speak, I believe that I may go in and start
exploring some of the links brought up in the writing of
the project, examining other cities, for example, that are
mentioned only briefly.  Or I may develop a different kind
of scaffolding upon which to base a new "remix" or related
manifestation.  I may return to some of the other visual
inspirations for the project (I'm a visual/sound artist as
well) to pick up an earlier thread that had been left
unexplored.  They may all be part of the same project,
parts of a larger meta-project, or separate but related
stand-alones.

Again, too early to tell whether I've been blessed/cursed
with a 30-year project like Samsara Congeries, or whether
the project will end at only five or eight years.

But the point you brought up in your previous post,
mIEKAL, about your fantasies of having a publisher bring
the whole thing together, is I think an important one to
consider for those who choose, or are compelled, to write
in longer modes.  I didn't set out to write something so
involved, and any fears of rejection or disinterest by
publishers were not strong enough to deter me, but I still
think about what I can do to get it out there in one
piece.  In the meantime, the project itself is divided
into 18 or 20 chapbook sized sub-books based on the
particular legs/neighborhoods of the walk, and so I have
the option of sending these mini-manuscripts out to
publishers, or self-publishing and collecting them in a
"box set."

And what are the options for longer works?  Publishers
like Blue Lion Books (http://www.bluelionbooks.info) who
seek manuscripts of 250pp or more, or Reality Street
Editions taking on Allen Fisher's 1970s project, Place
(http://freespace.virgin.net/reality.street/recent.html),
others?

I go back and forth between believing that my project will
get finished and edited and polished and published as a
nice, clean whole, and thinking, "Ah, what the hell was I
thinking?"

Hopefully more of the former.  I'm only a few years into
this particular project, but what I've learned so far is
that you need patience, a willingness to see things
long-term, and a humble awareness that the current project
may be a misstep that serves only as a means to get to the
next stage of development as a writer.

And it certainly is refreshing and inspiring to hear about
others taking on big projects as well.  Not only to
eventually invest in reading those works, but to know that
I'm not entirely out there by myself in the wilderness.

Thanks, Ric, for jump-starting this thread.

Best,

G.

It's so easy to say America says, America thinks, America is doing...
But I'm not so sure it's easy to really hear America, the America  which
is not "the media" which represents those who represent the few.

It's like an article someone sent me about how Americans don't
agree with the strikes in France.  And I wrote back saying, uh,  well,
all the interviews were done by the New York Times, and that's not
a source known to ask working class or poor people anything.
So, the people you NEED to ask about how they feel about the
strikes in France are people who are struggling, who actually
make up the majority of people in this country.  Trust me, my
father is a janitor, and he LOVES what's going on in France!

Of course I know Aryanil you are talking about poetry, and the
National Poetry Month, but I'm also saying here too on that, that
the media nutzoid around this "Month" is also not showing how
it's not just as you say, "someone in America has realized"
meaning,  it's not just some "one" but some MANYS.

It's hard to hear the voices of America.  No one really speaks  Pepsi,
a sub-coporate-English sent out over the global airwaves.

I figured this would be a good time to chime in because the conversation has
been moved to teenagers.

Recently, I did a short High School class on Poetry, keeping it relatively
simple. I started with a question that Don Byrd had posed to a Creative
writing class at SUNY Albany. What is Poetry? The answers were fairly
perdictable and then I played Kurt Schwitters Ur Sonata. Everyone in all
three classes laughed their asses off and then I played Christain Bok. The
laughter only increased and during one class, several people had the most
intriguing look on their face when they heard it. I then played Gertrude
Stein's If I told him a completed potrait of pIcasso, and no one liked it.
Then I finished with Celtic Mouth Music, another one they liked. There was a
lot more to the class, but you get the general idea.

Murat said that teenagers do not really like poetry. I guess that all
depends on what you define as poetry. For example, hip hop. In addition, I
read Walt Whitman when I was in 8th Grade and fell in love with it. I will
spare you the details, but I remember the exact moment I first read Song of
Myself. In addition, I had literate friends in my high school. That was when
I was exposed to James Joyce, William Burroughs, Jack kerouac, saw Robert
Pinsky read at West Point, and others that I cannot remember now. I will
admit, I did like novels better, but that was because I did not have the
chance to read many interesting poets.

This is considered either one long poem, or three longs poems. In any
case, my favorite is her "Flowering of the Rod." I love it for its
exquisite skill and tenderness, and for its subject matter. The

Ian,

I said most teenagers don't like poetry, nor do most older. people. I was
referring to the kind of poetry, usually called "innovative," referred to on this
list. Of course, a lot of the young love hip hop. I do consider some of the
rap music, and music created from other song fragments and reverse plays, etc.
(probably there is a name attached to the process) as fantastic art.

Child poetry plagiarist unmasked
Tue March 28, 2006 10:06 AM ET

 AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The 10-year-old winner of a   children's poetry
competition had to hand back her prize money   after newspaper readers
noticed that her poem was the work of a   well known writer.

 "It's a mini drama for her. She did not realize it had been   written
by someone else," a member of the competition jury said   Tuesday. "It
started as a school project and was followed by   many events ...
probably she just forgot."

 The parents of primary school pupil Fieke agreed to give   back the
125 euro ($150) prize and the jury admitted it should   have
recognized the work of children's author Francine Oomen   earlier.

My favorite poetry by H.D., also probably a long poem or a long series of short poems, is Helen In Egypt, which I first read when I was in my teens.  I still have an affection for it and, in fact, have checked out an opera by Richard Strauss called Der Aegyptische Helene just to see if there were any similarities.  It's a marvelous work and is based on the same myth as H.D.'s work.  There is also a play, if I remember correctly, by Euripides on the same subject.

Skip,

Thanks for mentioning IMPROVISATIONS.

I suspect you're right that the long works mentioned so far proceed on a
different basis.

IMPROVISATIONS develops along lines other than narrative or chronological.
It's intended to be a work "in and of the moment" and it changes according
to the moment, evolving from the textual to the visual. It has thematic
underpinnings, but those appear as elements of the focused improvisation as
opposed to a deliberate thematic development toward a conclusive statement.

Your books appear to collage experience rather than present it sequentially.
Each of us in our respective ways is creating complex textural patterns that
shift in mood and flow, to create experiences instead of statements.

Would any of the other poets posting new of their works care to comment?

I think Skip made an excellent point.

Don't forget Vernon Frazer's _Improvisations_.

For what it's worth, I have an untitled long piece in progress. (The first
two mss. have been published: What Of--Potes & Poets--and At That--Ahadada.)

I have a feeling that the long works currently mentioned proceed on a
different basis than the long works of Pound and others. This difference
might make for interesting distinctions in terms of authority,
romanticism, etc.

Halvard,

superb, thanks.

Quick point of clarification --

Tarkovsky's "Stalker" was based on the novel "Roadside Picnic" by the
Strugatsky brothers, not a novel by Lem.  A common misunderstanding.

Harry Gilonis sent me these from London; I pass them on.

Finlay was, well, an amazing provocative generative energy and voice,
demanding much from his listeners, and utterly rewarding. I spent six or
seven uninterrupted hours at Little Sparta a few years back, by myself =
(Ian
working in the studio), and could have spent three days and still come =
back
for more -- a garden of discoveries and beauties, humour passion anger =
and
grief -- a stirring and meditative experience unlike any other I'd had.=20

It's high time I went back -- and, given the news item I append at the =
end
of this long message -- I'd probably better hurry up.

Ian Hamilton Finlay=20
Poet and conceptual artist who created in 'Little Sparta' a =
revolutionary
idea of what a garden might be=20
The Independent 29 March 2006=20

Ian Hamilton Finlay, poet and artist: born Nassau, Bahamas 28 October =
1925;
CBE 2002; twice married (one son, one daughter); died Edinburgh 27 March
2006.=20

In Ian Hamilton Finlay's garden at "Little Sparta", in Lanarkshire, =
there's
a small upright stone, like a milestone or a gravestone, standing by a =
path.
Inscribed on it are two lines of words: MAN / A PASSERBY. In the =
abstract it
means, presumably: humans come into the world, and vanish from the =
world,
but the world was there long before them and will be there long after.
Humans only pass through, pass by. But by setting these words on a stone =
by
a path, the work fixes its general mortal reflection on to you, the =
viewer,
as you experience it. You stand in front of it for a time. Then you pass =
by.
It feels like disappearing.

Our greatest living artist is dead: his work survives him. It continues =
in
the world, and that shouldn't be forgotten, even while his embattled =
career
is being remembered. Obituaries and biographies too often equate the =
work
with the working life. It's something that stops when the artist stops. =
But
the work of Ian Hamilton Finlay is a wonder of its time, and I would =
think
for a long time to come.

What should be more and more impressive is the magnitude of it: the
diversity of its forms, the abundance of its invention, its sheer range =
of
experience and perspective. It doesn't plough a single furrow, a theme, =
a
look, a procedure. It is comprehensive in a way we have learnt to expect =
art
not to be. And, while there are many things that are puzzling about =
Finlay's
art, that low expectation may cause needless difficulty.

Finlay's manifold creations include postcards, prints, poems, books,
inscriptions, embroideries, neons, gallery sculptures, permanent
installations and landscapings around Europe, and - above all - his
philosophical/poetic garden in southern Scotland. Trying to encompass =
its
vision, no brief sentences beginning "it's about . . ." will do. It =
engages
with - among other things - agriculture, architecture, warfare, the =
home,
love, gardening, friendship, revolution, music, the organic world, the =
sky,
the sea, classical mythology and philosophy, romanticism, modern art. It
practises a sustained and interlocking meditation of these themes, and
continually gives hints of an embracing world-view.

Or, trying to catch its tone, you must realise that this is an art with =
many
tones. It has the breadth of response that a mature art should have. It
straddles the grand and the severe, praise, wonder, militant ferocity,
elegy, idyll, wit, sweetness, daft jokes. It is a world.

In today's loose art-speak, Finlay was a conceptual artist. He always =
called
himself a poet. He began as a poet. All his mature visual work has an
essential verbal component. All of it was made in collaboration with
executing artists and craftsmen, who were themselves - very rare in
contemporary art - always publicly credited.

Finlay was born in 1925 in the Bahamas - father a rum-runner - but his
childhood was mostly in Scotland. He spent his youth as art student
(briefly), serviceman, Orcadian shepherd, advertising copywriter. In the
late Fifties he began to publish poems and short stories. In the early
Sixties he was a leading member of the international Concrete Poetry
movement - a poetry of few words, where typography and layout are =
crucial
elements, and whose imperatives were for him moral: "a model of order, =
even
if set in a space of doubt".

He founded the Wild Hawthorn Press in Edinburgh, for his own and others'
publications, and the verbal-visual periodical Poor. Old. Tired. Horse. =
He
made and exhibited toys. There were some early battles with cultural
institutions. He invented the one-word poem (but it may have a title, of
indefinite length). "The Clouds Anchor / swallow."

In 1966 Finlay and his second wife, Sue, moved to Stonypath, a group of =
farm
buildings in a bare spot in the Pentland Hills. Here they began to =
garden,
reclaiming, shaping and cultivating the land, planting trees, digging =
ponds,
installing sculptures and inscriptions. This was the beginning of the =
work
for which Finlay is most recognised, and the subject of his best-known
epigram: "Some gardens are described as retreats, when they are really
attacks." (He is, among other things, one of the great modern aphorists.
Here's another, in a completely different register: "Scotland's =
birthright:
the scone of stone.")

Early works in the garden included Nuclear Sail, a black marble monolith
that was a sub's conning tower-cum-tombstone, which rose menacingly at =
the
end of a big pond. There was also a group of maples and hornbeams with =
an
inscribed stone plaque before it: BRING BACK THE BIRCH. A great clump of
high grass was "signed" with Albrecht D=FCrer's monogram carved in =
stone,
recreating for real the artist's famous drawing The Great Piece of Turf.
Lurking under bushes were stone tortoises, marked like Panzer tanks. Art =
and
nature and ocean and war were set in dialogue - a body of work and a =
body of
ideas mysteriously growing in tandem, a revolutionary idea of what a =
garden
might be.

The work and the struggle expanded. The 1970s and 1980s were the years =
of
Finlay's most high-pressure invention and high-profile battles. He =
produced
piercing visual/verbal metaphors with amazing fecundity. He discovered
classicism, and from it developed a quasi-religious doctrine, usually
defined as against contemporary values. His most explicitly =
argumentative
and combative works were a series of publications and exhibitions that
engaged in open culture-critique: a campaign against meaninglessness, in
which classical and neo-classical values were mobilised and renewed in
opposition to modern liberal utilitarian secularism.

Footnotes to an Essay (1977), Heroic Emblems (1977), Poussin Over Again
After Nature (1979), Unnatural Pebbles (1981), Talismans and Signifiers
(1984), The Third Reich Revisited (1984): each of these was "an attempt =
to
raise (in a necessarily roundabout way) the questions which our culture =
does
not want to put in idea form". The questions concerned the place of =
power
and violence in the world, the relationship of spirituality to nature =
and to
politics; the work was dedicated to redeeming these concerns from the
infecting taint of Nazism.

Finlay pointed to the way liberal society is utterly blank about what =
value
to attach to the military force that underpins its existence, the way it =
has
no doctrine of nature except as a (diminishing) resource. There were =
also
swipes at meaninglessness in modern art, including the delightful =
Detached
Sentences on Pebbles, where the Kettle's Yard cult of
artless-natural-form-as-highest- beauty is subjected to deep mockery. =
"The
modern PEBBLE is proposed as a sculpture, as it were, of a PEBBLE."

A prominent (and to some, puzzling) theme of this period is the French
Revolution. Finlay once explained its origins simply. His first public
installations had been constructed to such low standards that he had
thought, "We need a revolution. So I looked to see what revolutions =
there
had been." The (classically inspired) French Revolution, especially the
Jacobin phase, became for Finlay the exemplary historical event. Its
episodes, personalities and ideas provided the terms in which he framed =
his
conflict with the contemporary world. It also embodied his tragic =
conception
of politics, where idealism and catastrophe are inextricable.

The 1980s were the decade of public battles. Finlay had a knack for =
warfare.
His career was marked by feuds, withdrawn publications, cancelled
exhibitions. At Stonypath, a barn was converted into a neo-classical =
"Garden
Temple", dedicated "To Apollo His Muses His Missiles His Music". It was =
the
cause of a long and bitter dispute with the local authority as to its
rateable status, Strathclyde Region designating it an art gallery, =
Finlay a
religious building. Finlay recruited a band of supporters, named (after =
the
most fanatical Jacobin) "The Saint Just Vigilantes". In 1983 they =
repelled
the Sheriff Officer's attempted raid on Stonypath, to impound works in =
lieu
of rates. This was the First Battle of Little Sparta, as it was now =
renamed.
The next raid succeeded, though.

There were other Battles, including one against a National Trust guide =
to
"follies" in which the garden was presented as an eccentric whimsy. Each
fight generated enormous propaganda, and was conducted with a mixture of
fury, witty mischief and profound reflection.

A worse was to come at the end of the Eighties, when a commission to =
make a
work in Paris, marking the bicentennial of the French Revolution, was
opposed by a French art-world campaign that accused Finlay of being a =
Nazi.
He had made a sculpture where the lightning-flash insignia of the SS was
used to signify - the shock was deliberate - the utterly amoral violence =
of
the natural world. After much litigation, the project was never =
undertaken.

To speak, as one can't avoid doing, of Finlay's doctrines and disputes
shouldn't deflect attention from the substance of this work, its =
marvellous
and somewhat elusive power. No other artist working in the conceptual =
mode
has understood so well its essential devices of association and
juxtaposition. (No modern artist full stop has understood so well the
emotional force of typography.)

In its unceasing connection-making, Finlay's work reaches across huge
distances, arranges the most far-flung and breathtaking unions, the most
abrupt confrontations, the most homely similes. The machine gun as a =
flute
(the air-vents, the finger-stops); the swallow as the sky's anchor (see =
its
shape!); ploughed fields as "the fluted land", fluted like the grooves =
of a
classical column; the floats of a fishing-net as lemons; the wake of a =
boat
as stitching; a Malevich Red Square as the slant blade of a guillotine; =
a
bird-table as an aircraft carrier; a sun-dial as a sail.

The mental sweep is transporting, between war and peace, land and sea, =
wild
nature and human cultivation, remote antiquity and the present day, home =
and
the infinite. Or between the forms of art and the human heart - as in =
this
definition of "arch" (creative definition being another of Finlay's
favourite genres): "An Architectural Term. A Material Curve Sustained by
Gravity As Rapture by Grief". The most startling effect is the way =
Finlay
can, in the same breath so to speak, convey a severe high-mindedness and
sheer fondness for the things of life; as he said,

A lot of my work is to do with straightforward affection, (liking,
appreciation), and it always amazes me how little affection for ANYTHING
there is in art today.

His great work is the garden. It continued to be extended, almost up to =
the
artist's death. It will still be open to visitors in the summer months.
What's most striking is the care and fragility of it, the way it's not a
great act of moulding, but a series of small piecemeal acts of arranging =
and
placing. It exemplifies one of Finlay's watchwords: piety. The works are =
set
in an environment that is only partly a human construct, in growing and
encroaching nature, in changing wind, light and weather, and it respects
that distinction, through scale and restraint. This conduct of art as an =
act
of observance, not an act of mastery, gives the work its grace.

It reflects the fundamental axis of Finlay's vision: the encounter =
between
the human and what is not the human. His art is an affirmation of our
inhabitation, cultivation and working of the world; and, at the same =
time,
an emphatic statement of human limits. It looks to where those limits =
are
met, in wild green world, the boundless sea, the convulsions of nature =
and
human destructiveness, death. Human life - man, a passer-by - is =
understood
in relation to what is beyond it, a realm that is often characterised as =
the
divine, the gods, to be honoured and propitiated. The perspective is =
pagan,
classical, tragic.

For years Finlay never left the bounds of his isolated territory. He had =
a
kind of "agoraphobia". He saw friends and visitors. The work and the
campaigns were conducted by post. The exhibitions were organised first =
by
his wife, and later - after their separation - by his assistant Pia =
Maria
Simig. He only left to go to hospital. But when he suffered the first in =
a
series of strokes, around the turn of the century, this home-boundness
strangely cleared. In his last years he went to his openings, went to
restaurants, visited friends, went abroad. Already-conceived projects
continued to be executed. He never originated another work.

"He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which =
nothing
has a tendency to fill up . . . Let us go to the next best: - There is
nobody." Finlay is dead, and those words from William Gerard Hamilton's
tribute, on the death of Samuel Johnson, are what I want to say too. In =
the
art of the last 50 years, there's been nothing like it.

Ian Hamilton Finlay
Individualistic Scottish artist and poet who ran his garden at Little =
Sparta
as a separate city state
Michael McNay The Guardian =A0=A0=A0Wednesday 29 March 2006

Almost in the Scottish borders, south of the Pentland hills, lies Little
Sparta. North, of course, is Edinburgh, the Athens of Scotland. The =
ancient
enmity between these two civilisations was a re-creation in the 1960s by =
the
Scottish artist and concrete poet Ian Hamilton Finlay, who has died aged =
80,
when he bought a farm called Stonypath, near the little community of
Dunsyre, 25 miles southwest of the capital, and renamed it after the
militaristic Greek city state often opposed to Athens.

If he had intended his creation as a metaphor for the old opposition =
between
artist and establishment, it became reality in 1983, in a now mythical
battle between Finlay, his supporters and a Strathclyde sheriff officer,
celebrated today in a carved memorial stone at the entrance to the farm =
as
"the first battle of Little Sparta".

In a rerun of the notorious case in which US customs attempted to tax
Brancusi's abstract bronze sculpture, Bird, as an unreconstructed lump =
of
bronze, the Strathclyde authority decreed that Finlay had turned his
farmhouse into an art gallery and should pay higher rates. Not at all, =
he
replied, it's a temple, and he refused to pay. The sheriff officer =
turned up
at the gates of Little Sparta to seize artworks in lieu, but in front of
television cameras summoned to the scene by Finlay, the artist and his
irregulars repulsed him. Later, the sheriff returned unannounced and =
took
his due, but this time the cameras were absent so the incident was not
enshrined in the myth.

For a contemplative and amiable man, Finlay accreted a notable list of
run-ins with the authorities and his friends. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid
(Christopher Grieve) was best man at his first wedding (in 1945 to =
Marion
Fletcher), but later the two fell out spectacularly and Macdiarmid =
described
Finlay's work as vicious. The marriage did not last either. In 1987 =
Finlay
was commissioned to create a garden in Versailles for the bicentennial =
of
the French revolution; he lost the job after a French art magazine =
accused
him of Nazi sympathies, even though he won a subsequent action for
defamation.

The improbable roots of all this lay in the only semblance of education
Finlay received: wartime service in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). =
He
was born in Nassau, in the Bahamas, where his father (Finlay said) was a
bootlegger; his parents soon returned to Scotland, but he left school at =
13
and had only a year at Glasgow School of Art before the outbreak of war. =
To
his experiences in the RASC he owed his fascination with the military
hardware that became a leit-motif of his art.

But all this was to come. First, Finlay became a shepherd in Orkney, and
began to warble his native woodnotes wild, though his poetry was closer =
to
haiku than to Shakespeare. His fellow Scots did not receive it
enthusiastically but the poets of Black Mountain College, a testbed of =
the
arts in North Carolina, embraced it warmly. There, Josef Albers brought =
from
the Bauhaus an approach that integrated art with product design and
typography, and John Cage preached breaking down the barriers between =
art
and life, that siren call of 20th-century art.

Across the Atlantic, Finlay was listening. Concrete poetry consolidates =
the
shapes of lines and the choice of different fonts and sizes, as well as =
the
meaning of words. In that sense, Lewis Carroll and Guillaume Apollinaire
were forerunners, but modernists claim Finlay as first among equals - if =
not
actually inventor. Certainly he moved on from postcards and poster poems =
to
making poetry literally concrete by carving it into stone or, rather,
ordaining it to be carved by craftsmen collaborators. A poem might =
consist
of one word, but it had multiple authors. In 1961 he founded Wild =
Hawthorn
Press to propagate his work, but he never reprinted the earlier slim =
volumes
(slimmer than most) containing his verse and stories.

In 1966, two years after marrying his second wife, Sue =
MacDonald-Lockhart,
he bought the five-acre Stonypath farm in Lanarkshire, with its derelict
garden, renamed it, and from then on thought and worked as an artist
philosopher, while Sue took charge of the planting. Among her flowers =
and
shrubs he placed sculpture and ponds (one of them ambitiously called a =
loch)
and sundials. People thought of gardens as a retreat, he once remarked, =
but
his garden was an attack.

Sure enough, some of the classical figures in the garden wear =
camouflaged
combat kit. He corresponded with Hitler's architect and fixer Albert =
Speer
about the prison garden he had created in Spandau, and, in Little Sparta =
in
1982, Finlay added a series of works called Third Reich Revisited,
containing references to Luftwaffe aircraft. Among the most provocative =
is a
work based on the two shots Poussin had at a subject he called The =
Arcadian
Shepherds, showing a group of men and a woman uncovering a tomb engraved
with the Latin epigraph, Et in Arcadia Ego (I too was in Arcady). Finlay
took this allegory of the futility of life and embellished it with a =
tank
bearing SS insignia.

He would not answer questions about his intention in subsuming symbols =
of
the Third Reich into his art, and some critics have fought shy of =
endorsing
his work in case something nasty about his politics was to come out of =
the
woodwork. It seems unlikely. Like the gun barrels which pun on muscial
instruments, the German regalia is part of a general metamorphosis - =
though
it may have brought about the accusations which led to the loss of the
Versailles commission.

Even though he created several other landscape installations - in =
Germany,
Brittany, the Netherlands, and one in San Diego - the French project =
meant a
lot to Finlay, and its loss was a setback: French revolutionary =
references
had been central to much of his work, including a delicate, 12-piece =
dinner
set for a last supper, bearing resonant revolutionary names such as =
Marie
Antoinette, Charlotte Corday and the victim of her assassin's knife,
Jean-Paul Marat.

Undaunted, Finlay created, with Nicholas Sloan, another modern homage to
classicism in a garden at Stockwood park, Luton; and the Serpentine =
Gallery,
in London, has a permanent installation in its grounds. One of the =
objects
of his especial ire, the Scottish Arts Council, recently gave him a =
=A330,000
award, Aberdeen University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1987, =
and,
at 77, he graciously accepted a CBE: all signs, surely, that peace had
broken out at Little Sparta.

Sue survives him as do their children, Alec and Eileen.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0March 29
2006

The artist and poet Ian Hamilton Finlay, who died on Monday aged 80, =
spent
his lifetime demonstrating that artistic greatness could be carved out =
of
the most unlikely materials.

Some 40 years in the creation, his garden Little Sparta is a unique =
living
work of art - combining poetry, sculpture, history and landscape design =
in
the tradition of an 18th century philosophical garden. =A0

A lifelong iconoclast and spiky individualist, Finlay was also an
inspirational figure who found poetry in the everyday and whose fierce
revolutionary temperament was matched only by his evident affection for =
the
world.

Scotland was famously slow to recognise his significance. Nevertheless, =
by
the time of his 80th birthday last year it was clear that he was finally
regarded as by far the most important artist of the post-war era.=20

Little Sparta - hewn out of a bleak hill farm, Stonypath, on the edge of =
the
Pentland Hills by Dunsyre, Lanarkshire - is the country's single most
impressive work of contemporary art and is widely-acknowledged as =
Britain's
most important post-war garden. =A0=A0

Born in Nassau, in the Bahamas, in 1925, Finlay returned to Scotland as =
a
child. The family fortune, founded on bootlegging, was lost. His formal
education was disrupted by the outbreak of war and his evacuation to =
Orkney.

After a brief stint at Glasgow School of Art, he joined the Royal Army
Service Corps and saw action in Germany. After the war he worked for =
periods
as a shepherd and labourer in Orkney and began writing.=20

His short stories of the 1950s were largely published in The Glasgow =
Herald,
and some early plays broadcast by the BBC.

His poetry combined folk idioms, Scots language and radical experiment. =
In
Edinburgh in 1961, alongside Jessie McGuffie Sheeler, he founded his
imprint, The Wild Hawthorn Press, followed the next year by the journal
Poor. Old. Tired. Horse.

Throughout the 1960s he moved towards the visual arts, making toys and
kinetic sculpture and collaborating increasingly with print-makers and
craftsmen.=20

In autumn 1966, Finlay and his wife Sue moved to Stonypath, where they =
set
about creating a garden which was increasingly classical in its =
allusion. It
is not the work of a horticulturalist, but an artist. Its attractive and
simple planting less important than the 275 art works in the garden - =
which
form a rich and complex sequence of statuary, landscape architecture and
inscriptions. =A0

Finlay's enthusiasms were diverse, yet achieved a remarkable consistency =
in
his hands. Themes of classical philosophy, French revolutionary =
politics,
pastoral poetry, contemporary warfare, sailing and sea-going permeate =
the
garden and his printed works.

Little Sparta relied on a whole host of artistic collaborators, but =
remained
the product of his distinctive direction.=20

Much of Finlay's career was marked by his conflict with authorities and
institutions, which he turned into an art form in itself: a kind of
combination of political theatre and performance.

In the early 1980s, a dispute with the Scottish Arts Council contributed =
to
a period of neglect at home as his reputation grew abroad, particularly =
in
France.

In 1983, a long-running rates row with Strathclyde Regional Council, =
over
the garden gallery he regarded as a classical temple and they regarded =
as a
rateable building, resulted in a sheriff officer's raid and spectacular
stand-off that became known as the First Battle of Little Sparta.=20

The apparent contradiction between the reclusive rural poet and the =
angry
artist was a theme running throughout Finlay's life.=20

Little Sparta is a place of solitude and contemplation but its ideas and
sculptural motifs also tackle such challenging themes as the Third Reich =
and
nuclear warfare. =A0

Finlay's pursuit of beauty was often tempered with controversial or
uncomfortable subject matter, driven by a sense of moral urgency.=20

Finlay was made a CBE in 2002, but he was also famously proud when the
Communist Party of France presented him with a bust of the revolutionary
Saint-Just in 1991. He regarded himself as a working artist until the =
end,
despite the pressures of ill health.




Last summer, with three shows marking his 80th birthday, he chose a new
presentation of work at Edinburgh's Inverleith House rather than a
retrospective, and created a new garden work for his Edinburgh dealers, =
the
Ingleby Gallery. =A0Currently his work is appearing in the Tate =
Triennial
exhibition at London's Tate Britain, alongside artists some five decades =
his
junior. His legacy for younger artists includes his ability to fuse the
written word with the material world.

His son, the artist Alec Finlay, has continued the tradition, with his =
own
imprint for artists' books.=20

Above all, Finlay's lasting lesson is that dedication and hard work in
pursuit of a singular artistic vision will eventually win out against =
the
vagaries of fashion or establishment approval.

Before he died Finlay gifted the garden to the charitable Little Sparta
Trust to ensure its survival and future upkeep. It is the only possible
monument to a unique and irreplaceable figure.=20

He is survived by his son Alec and daughter Ailie.=20

Art and nature: The fragile world of Little Sparta  The death of artist =
Ian
Hamilton Finlay has left his extraordinary garden - a  fusion of poetry,
sculpture and plants - facing yet another challenge.=20
Jonathan  Brown reports
Published: 29 March 2006=20

Survival amid the raw, windswept beauty of the Pentland Hills has =
challenged
generations of shepherds and farmers. Forty years ago, something =
altogether
more  fragile - a poetry garden - took its place in this unforgiving
landscape. Dug  out of an old potato field by the poet-artist Ian =
Hamilton
Finlay and his wife,  Sue, the garden, despite the elements, flourished =
into
a work of genius.  What they created was as much a challenge to the
intellect as an aesthetic  treat. Little Sparta, named in an ironic =
riposte
to nearby Edinburgh - which  boasts the nickname Athens of the North -
blends heavyweight ideas and  historical themes from European =
civilisation
with the upland grandeur  surrounding it.

Alongside the planting and landscaping, Hamilton Finlay used his terse
poetry  and sculpture to explore notions ranging from pre-Socratic
philosophy to the  idealistic failures of the French Revolution. So
successful was he, that art  historian Sir Roy Strong declared Little =
Sparta
to be the "only original garden"  to be created in Britain since 1945. =
In
2004, 50 leading Scottish artists voted  it "the nation's greatest work =
of
art".

But the death of Hamilton Finlay on Monday at the age of 80 has focused
renewed  attention on the vulnerability of his astonishing creation. A =
trust
set up 11  years ago to secure Little Sparta for future generations, =
faces a
constant  financial struggle to maintain the artist's vision and =
preserve
the integrity of  his work. According to its treasurer, Jessie Sheeler, =
more
than =A350,000 is  needed each year to preserve the seven acres of =
grounds.
New projects, such as  the creation of a hortus conclusus, or enclosed
garden, out of a semi-ruined  barn, and the preservation of the artist's
home, where he lived and worked right  up until his death, only add to =
the
task.

"Our hope is to be able to raise enough money to guarantee that the =
garden
will  be kept as Ian wanted it and keep it up to the standard he did," =
she
said. One  of the big dangers, however, is the threat of being overrun =
by
visitors. There  are few paths and the grasslands can quickly be churned
into mud by the trample  of feet. Last year the number of visitors was
limited to 5,000. Despite Little  Sparta being virtually inaccessible by
public transport, applications to visit  were hopelessly oversubscribed.

The garden is divided into nine discrete areas. These range from a
well-tended  allotment to wild gardens of heather and grass, an area of
clipped English  parkland and a neo-classical temple pool. "Planting is =
used
as part of the  composition of the landscapes. There are trees, wild =
ferns,
grasses, much of it  indigenous. Ian tried to garden with a very light =
hand
- he didn't want to  distort nature," explained Ms Sheeler.

But explaining Little Sparta can be difficult, comments Paul Nesbitt,
director  of exhibitions at Inverleith House in Edinburgh, who has =
organised
summer coach  parties to the gardens and has been an enthusiastic =
champion
of Hamilton Finlay. "You approach it through a landscape of bleak =
terrain.
When you enter, you go  into a world where you lose all sense of where =
you
are but become acutely aware  of yourself as a human being. Ian was so =
aware
of the human condition. His moral  philosophy and view of the world
underpinned everything he did. He was an  artist, poet, moralist and a
fantastic gardener - he was good at all of them." Nicholas Serota, =
director
of the Tate, said Little Sparta was a "unique  contribution" to =
contemporary
art. "In his work as a philosopher, poet and  sculptor, [Hamilton =
Finlay]
reinvigorated the classical tradition in art. His  works combine beauty =
and
precision in a celebration of the relationship between  man and nature," =
he
said.

Hamilton Finlay's relationship with the art establishment has not always
been so  benevolent. In 1978 he fell out in spectacular fashion with the
Scottish Arts  Council after his work was withdrawn from an exhibition =
at an
Edinburgh gallery.  In 1983 his feud with Strathclyde regional authority
erupted into full-blown  conflict - the so-called War of Little Sparta -
when officials tried to seize  artworks in lieu of unpaid business rates
they claimed he owed.

The artist and his supporters prepared to repel the bailiffs and after a
tense  stand-off and some dramatic, staged explosions, the authority
withdrew. The  money was never collected and Strathclyde Region was =
later
abolished.

Hamilton Finlay perhaps failed to achieve the financial rewards enjoyed =
by
other  contemporary artists, even though his reputation has continued to
grow. He was  shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1985 and staged major
exhibitions at the  Serpentine and the National Museum of Scotland in =
recent
years.

But according to Ms Sheeler, his greatest achievement - Little Sparta - =
was
earned through the "sweat of his brow". Maintaining it for posterity =
will
require the exertion of others.=20

Since I wrote an improvisation, I intended it to have a beginning and an
end, although neither was predetermined. But I tried to write with an open
form approach, which would allow the reader to dip into it at whether chosen
point for however many occasions and experience another improvisation based
on the text, but not on its sequence.

I hope some others will talk about their work.

Mine wasn't a well thought out message (unlike yours), rather

a spontaneous sarcasm that many of us couldn't suppress. In my

particular case, it was perhaps a bit more caustic.



Let me explain why.



I am Bengali poet (write in Bengali, a South Asian language)

who grew up in Calcutta,India. Poetry in the Bengali speaking

world has a very high public profile(Tagore, a strong reason).

As an experimental poet, you do come across many challenges in

such a society where some taste of poetry runs in every home.



I have been living in the US for about a decade now, my work

not related to arts or literature by any means. The state of

poetry, as it is today in this country, came to me as a huge

cultural shock. I have never quite been able to overcome it.



Interestingly, that sort of reduces the burden on the experimental

poet, as it dilutes the power gradient. However, I realize,

experimental or not, the challenges poets in America face today

are far far more than what we were upto in Bengal.



I certainly didn't mean to offend anyone in this community.



In a new century, in a new world, where poetry looks endangered to me,

I miss someone like Ginsberg every single day.

It's so easy to say America says, America thinks, America is doing...

But I'm not so sure it's easy to really hear America, the America  which

is not "the media" which represents those who represent the few.



It's like an article someone sent me about how Americans don't

agree with the strikes in France.  And I wrote back saying, uh,  well,

all the interviews were done by the New York Times, and that's not

a source known to ask working class or poor people anything.

So, the people you NEED to ask about how they feel about the

strikes in France are people who are struggling, who actually

make up the majority of people in this country.  Trust me, my

father is a janitor, and he LOVES what's going on in France!



Of course I know Aryanil you are talking about poetry, and the

National Poetry Month, but I'm also saying here too on that, that

the media nutzoid around this "Month" is also not showing how

it's not just as you say, "someone in America has realized"

meaning,  it's not just some "one" but some MANYS.



It's hard to hear the voices of America.  No one really speaks  Pepsi,

I would think that any poem, incl. any long poem, that supposes itself
to be
vocal, will expect linear (of lines, ahem) reading, its being a time
art as is,
say, a piano solo. Certainly, if you do not read H.D.'s war trilogy
aloud, you
don't have the poem. That wonderful poem that was first printed for
Oxford
by the Bowering Press.

It is great to be back on this list.=20

I find it hypocritical for Americans to dwell on Chinese politics when
the real monster in the world today is America. There is so much we can
actually at least try to do here at home to change it, yet people find
time in their hearts to fall in line with party policy (foaming over
faraway evils). The hypocrisy in such righteousness....

Anyways, back to poetry--at home I don't see any mega-popular verse or
satirical doggerel making the word-of-mouth rounds on the internet
lampooning the U.S. government. Free press or not in China, there is a
satirical verse tradition in China and one in particular that is
immensely popular now among Chinese (especially students, it seems).
Here is a translation I drafted of one version:


Central Committee Television "News Broadcast" Dictionary

Meetings are held without fanfare,
their decisions always reasonable.=20
Discussion is always important,
the applause always cordial.
Leaders are always caring,
their views always kind.
Personal interviews are granted
and progress proceeds smoothly.
Projects exceed expectations=20
and accomplishments are always great.
Construction is always solid,
efficiency always remarkable.=20
Resolutions always pass,
and the people are always behind them,
groups always standing in solidarity,
the masses always content.
the leaders always smiling,
every problem having its solution.
In all the land, no matter is too small to handle,
and visitors are always welcome,
opposition never is met with violence.
Negotiations are always sincere,
achievements surpass all measures.
Relations with Japan are always friendly,
relations with America always cooperative.
Construction is always ahead of schedule,
holidays are always auspicious.
Positions announced are always correct,
the strategies brilliant.
Women are all liberated,
the well-to-do all satisfied,
and no sacrifice goes unnoticed,
so great are the hurt feelings of the Chinese people.
Although it is like this----resistance is futile.
The upshot: now it's all up to you.

Seven-year-old prodigy.

http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/60921.htm

=09
March 13, 2006 -- YOUNGSTER'S BLACK-POWER POEM RILES SCHOOL
A 7-year-old prodigy unleashed a firestorm when she recited a poem =20
she wrote comparing Christopher Columbus and Charles Darwin to =20
"pirates" and "vampires" who robbed blacks of their identities and =20
human rights.

Hundreds of parents of Peekskill middle- and high-school students =20
received a recorded phone message last week apologizing for little =20
Autum Ashante's poem, titled "White Nationalism Put U in Bondage."

"Black lands taken from your hands, by vampires with no remorse," the =20=

aspiring actress and poet wrote. "They took the gold, the wisdom and =20
all the storytellers. They took the black women, with the black man =20
weak. Made to watch as they changed the paradigm of our village.

"Yeah white nationalism is what put you in bondage. Pirates and =20
vampires like Columbus, Morgan and Darwin."

Autum was invited to speak at the Westchester schools on Feb. 28 by =20
Melvin Bolden, a music teacher at the middle school who advises the =20
high school's Black Culture Club and is a member of the Peekskill =20
City Council.

Autum, whose r=E9sum=E9 includes several television appearances and =20
performances at the Apollo Theater and the African Burial Ground in =20
Manhattan, told The Post that her poem was meant to instill pride in =20
black students and to encourage them to steer clear of violence.

"I don't think there's anything wrong with my poem. I was trying to =20
tell them the straight-up truth," Autum said. "I'm trying to tell =20
them not to fight because they're killing the brothers and sisters."

Autum, who is home-schooled in Mount Vernon and speaks several =20
languages, prefaced her performance at the high school with a Black =20
Panthers' pledge asking black youngsters to not harm one another.

It did not sit well with parents.

In a telephone interview with The Post, Bolden said Autum has been =20
"unofficially" banned from performing in a district school again and =20
that school officials would review transcripts of future speakers.

"It's unfortunate, because some teachers said they wanted this little =20=

girl to explain the things she said to their students, but some =20
parents don't want her on school grounds," Bolden said.

"[The poem] might have been a little too aggressive for what the =20
middle-school kids are ready to handle," Bolden added.

Kimberly Greene, a mother of children in the high school and middle =20
school, said she was shocked when she got the recorded phone message.

"If there are people who are upset about what she said, the schools =20
should have talked about and analyzed it rather than send a message =20
to everyone saying this little girl was offensive," Greene said.

Autum's father, Batin Ashante, said he can't believe the fuss over =20
his daughter's poem.

"She's a little girl who does poetry about real things. She doesn't =20
do poetry about cotton candy," Ashante said. "She's a serious little =20
person."

I edit a parallel literature journal called Kaurab (www.kaurab.com)
which has a thin english section called Poetry & Peripherals.
This section doesn't have much Indian poetry though.

Kaurab is a 40-year old Bengali parallel literature journal and the
first Indian poetry journal online (10th year running). In the
late nineties, we began developing a poetry community colony
of a rare kind - Bhalopahar.
http://bhalopahar.kaurab.com

This is village developed by poets and poetry readers in an arid
rural zone with a two-fold aim. Firstly, to help the tribal education
and help the poor tribal locals find a job, and secondly to practise
and perpetrate the poetry they believe in. Every single buck that
goes to support this project comes from poets and poetry readers
with virtually no support from the Government or other organizations.
We chose to keep it that way.

So Bhalopahar (the word means Good Mountain) is a project that is a
live example of how POETRY CAN CHANGE LIVES in a very very real way.

The link below contains some English translations of a few mainstream
Bengali poets in the post-Tagorian era.

Hi Stephen,
Thank you for your response.
Please send me some more info  (and links) on your current
and past poetic endeavors. I am intrigued.

My 'study' in the long poem goes back to
my initial exposure to the genre.
My first poetic 'love' was Rilke's Elegies when I was a wee
bit younger than today. Ever since then I have been fascinated with
the whole diverse history, evolution  and structure of
the 'long poem'. The modernists (Pound, Williams, Merrill, McGrath, etc.)
and the 'borderline' postmodernists (Zukofsky, Olson, Duncan, Dorn, etc.)
as well as the current day masters of the genre ( Allen Fisher, Scalapino,
Howe,  Silliman, Frazer, Duplessis, etc) have kept me aspiring to delve
deeper into their methods
of  creation, diversity and novelty and has been a constant
source of inspiration. My ongoing study in this field is currently leading
to a more
extensive purview which
I will elaborate on when the perspective becomes a bit more honed and
better focused -
Thank You & Be Well,
Ric

Dean,
Sorry, but I find your comment regarding America a bit juvenile.=20

Of course, President GWB is an idiot; true enough, the GWB =
administration has done more damage internationally to the image of =
America than any Class "C" films from Hollywood ever did, and indeed, =
Karl Rove deserves to be imprisoned.  All that as a given, doesn't lay =
blame on "America." =20

The blame belongs on the party of the Right, not on the people of the =
place...though it is true the people of the place put the idiots of the =
Right in charge, damn the bunch of us for that.=20

Your accusation smacks of blaming Germans for Nazi antics...sorry, that =
just wasn't true.  Though it is true Nazis were Third Reich creeps and =
Germans, they were not Germany. =20

And, neither are the leaders of China the nation...though, indeed, they =
are Chinese, they are not all of China.  I have friends in three cities =
in China; they love the people.  They hate the government...the =
government is not the people, despite the message to the contrary, both =
here and there.=20

Also, last I checked, I was in no danger calling GWB a moron and an =
idiot.  At least two of my friends currently working in China say that =
kind of verbal freedom is not yet allowed in China.  Too bad! Seems to =
me there's real value in name calling the folks in charge...makes the =
lot of us who voted them into power feel better for our personal moments =
of idiocy.=20

  It is great to be back on this list.=20

  I find it hypocritical for Americans to dwell on Chinese politics when
  the real monster in the world today is America. There is so much we =
can
  actually at least try to do here at home to change it, yet people find
  time in their hearts to fall in line with party policy (foaming over
  faraway evils). The hypocrisy in such righteousness....

  Anyways, back to poetry--at home I don't see any mega-popular verse or
  satirical doggerel making the word-of-mouth rounds on the internet
  lampooning the U.S. government. Free press or not in China, there is a
  satirical verse tradition in China and one in particular that is
  immensely popular now among Chinese (especially students, it seems).
  Here is a translation I drafted of one version:


  Central Committee Television "News Broadcast" Dictionary

  Meetings are held without fanfare,
  their decisions always reasonable.=20
  Discussion is always important,
  the applause always cordial.
  Leaders are always caring,
  their views always kind.
  Personal interviews are granted
  and progress proceeds smoothly.
  Projects exceed expectations=20
  and accomplishments are always great.
  Construction is always solid,
  efficiency always remarkable.=20
  Resolutions always pass,
  and the people are always behind them,
  groups always standing in solidarity,
  the masses always content.
  the leaders always smiling,
  every problem having its solution.
  In all the land, no matter is too small to handle,
  and visitors are always welcome,
  opposition never is met with violence.
  Negotiations are always sincere,
  achievements surpass all measures.
  Relations with Japan are always friendly,
  relations with America always cooperative.
  Construction is always ahead of schedule,
  holidays are always auspicious.
  Positions announced are always correct,
  the strategies brilliant.
  Women are all liberated,
  the well-to-do all satisfied,
  and no sacrifice goes unnoticed,
  so great are the hurt feelings of the Chinese people.
  Although it is like this----resistance is futile.
  The upshot: now it's all up to you.

I am wondering if the same (no end or beginning) can be said of Beverly
Dahlen's A Reading  - a work that now extends over almost 30 years and 20 or
so parts. (Instance Press will publish books 18 - 20) later this year, I
believe. (Good news after long silence.)  The language of the work kicks out
against any notion of narrative continuity - as if to say implicitly
narration is someone else's business, not mine.   The reader can wade in
anywhere, I suspect, and come back with something, but that something is not
a story in any conventional sense. And you could probably return a week
later at the same place have a quite different experience. The proverb about
the river!  And yet there is rarely any question that the books interface
with historical moments/events -

In any case I can never read Beverly in the same sense that one reads Paul
Metcalf's wonderful long prose poems (Genoa, for example) that still adhere
to a narrative construct of beginnings and endings.

Beverly Dahlen and George Stanley (old & close friends) continue to redefine
obscurity or 'invisible presence'  as an important function in American
letters. Ignore them at your own risk!

Yes, must - thank you, Peter Q - get to the Fisher Place

A while back I got the idea that I'd write a "long poem"
that basically shadows Whitman's SONG OF MSELF
(or the untitled poem that he later called song of myself).

"Shadowed it," was "written off of it." A kind of formal device
that many won't necessarily call a formal device,
yet even though Whitman has never really been one of my all-time
favorite poets or anything, I feel this piece can still really
challenge or threaten many poet's notion of form
(basically the best thing about his form is the
DON'T WORRY ABOUT FORM sensibility that informs it)

And even thought Whitman is so intensely invoked
by enough people across the spectrum of most "legitimate"
contemporary poetry, as well as by many outside the poet corners
(now forever linked with images of Monica's semen-stained dress?),
it's almost like one of those "Jesus" things---
how the world Jesus fought loves to shout out his name, etc---

So, I got really excited and passionate about this project.
Sometimes it falls into the "talking back to Walt" mode,
and yes at times it explores the weird self-referential conundrum
of making someone else's organic form into your (forced?) structure,
an issue whoch may only be of relevance in "poetry circles"
(like for those who take, say, CHARLES OLSON'S BREATH to be THEIRS,
thus "following" him, etc....),
but it was also cool, to play with what the so-called "visionary"
mode is, or can or can not be, to me, or "nowadays."
There's a few sections I just don't even want to write off of---
when he gets into the Texas war, etc...the AENEID part of Song of Myself,
but I'll play with it.


Anyway, I've left it sit. I'm planning to reopen it this spring/summer.
If it bombs, it "bombs." But I'm pretty excited about it
coz yeah some restraints need to be loosed these days....

Chris

Talk about long poems, the Grolier has some legs, too.
Yet - probably intimates of Harvard Square will know this - why did Louisa
Solano, the seller - loose so much sleep over poetry and poetry books?
She sounds like the unforgiving step-mother of veritably unruly,
in-your-face children.   But, maybe, that was the case? Was it the dead
poets or the living poets? Or, more likely, small press publishers demandin=

Poetry Bookshop Changes Hands


By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER  (NY Times)
Published: March 30, 2006

The Grolier Poetry Book Shop in Harvard Square, the oldest poetry bookstore
in the United States, is about to change hands for the second time in eight
decades, Publishers Weekly reported. The influential store, opened in 1927
and a favorite of poets including E. E. Cummings, T. S. Eliot and Marianne
Moore, has been sold to Ifeanyi Mentiki, a professor of philosophy at
Wellesley College. He is also a poet whose most recent collection, "Of
Altai, the Bright Light," was published last year by Earthwinds Editions.
"The store has meant a lot to so many of us," he said. "I wanted to make
sure it continued." The sale, by Louisa Solano, who owned the store for 31
years, was prompted by her ill health and will become final tomorrow. "I=B9m
going to catch up on 30 years of sleep," Ms. Solano said.

George,

  I don't want to attack you or anyone else, to make this personal, but you are plain wrong.

  I live in China, know of people who've been detained and beaten, disappeared, some of them friends, and still more who're in exile -- and this is not just policy (as opposed to the depravity of an administration) but what is called totalitarianism. Additionally, I've lived in Communist countries before (and my wife is from a former one).

  We throw out all kinds of hyperbole, which is apt to be done by the disatisfied, and its a given that thoughtful people might do this, but why confuse, muttle, and bring us farther from discussions of human dignity, rights, etc. The leader of China is a very bad man, asked any Tibetan or person from Xinjiang, and will remain in power until he says his term is over.  Incidently, he is regularly assessed as being more repressive than his predicessors.

  And there's no chance of there being demonstrations in the streets (unless organized by the gov't against Japan), all institutions extensions, arms that brought concern to the Russians during the 1960s (and only facades have changed any cultural anthropologist might argue) are the reasons for why India has nuclear arms, etc. You do know that China invaded India during the 60s. Nepal is currently worried about China, because of Chinese history of expansion. There's a context to all this, so please do not miss it. More....more...more...

  I would argue this kind of thinking, the kind of carelessness you're spouting, is precising why the US is naggingly a mess (and this only my opinion). In the world of politics and historical alliances, real struggles over what our world will mean, few are in agreement with you. I know what Bush's done, have had my own life threatened, have passed not as a Canadian, but as a Turk and Mongol (because my biracial heritage has given me this brown silky skin) and second class status suits me fine.

  You can backchannel me if you should want more info. I'm disappointed in the US too, but let's not sound cliche or use hackneyed jargon which is, in the end, and perhaps regrettably outdated and meaningless.

  Robert Creeley died a year ago today.

  Catching a bus!
  AJ

One of my favorite long poems is "Exercises for Ear"
by Stephen Jonas.  Oh man, he's fantastic!

BUT, my FAVORITE NEW LONG POEM HANDS DOWN
is the amazing OBEDIENCE by kari edwards!

if you haven't read this newest book by kari edwards
(from Factory School:
_http://www.factoryschool.org/pubs/heretical/vol1/edwards/05edwardsCOV.jpg_
(http://www.factoryschool.org/pubs/heretical/vol1/edwards/05edwardsCOV.jpg) )
pick it up, it's without a doubt one of the best new books of poetry!
AND, one of the best book-length poems I've ever read!
It's up there with Notley's The Descent of Alette.

When kari read in Philadelphia recently I was literally SPELLBOUND
by her reading.  You had to see it to know what I'm talking about,  and
I wish it was on video.  She has this way of reading while standing  on
the outside rims of her shoes, rising into that stance, then falling  in
measure. Well, not a measure conducted by the poem, it's almost as
if there's a power rising up into her, and through her, as she reads,
rising to the outside rims again and falling suddenly, over and over.
And with that the SPEED of the reading, which never lets you not
follow or listen, but the energy she builds has a way of never  letting
go for a solid thirty minutes, and when she stops reading you are
hanging high in the air with it.

Very glad I got to witness that!  She lives in India now, so who  knows
when we'll get to see her read again here in the states.

When talking about her new book she asked that we read it in one
sitting.  But to be honest I'm a bit addicted to it, and don't want  to
have it be over that SOON.  Here's my latest favorite part:

"dear absent,
I speak
fighting would be absent pain
in a single thing
a place
a state identity
hung about the body
not happening
frozen - not crossing
situated never resembling
a musical deviation
reconsidered in tones and intervals
halfway between confusion and total glossolalia
a thing invented in fiction
that disguises the body
as a universal object"

Buddhadeb Bose and Amiya Chakraborty are two major post-Tagorian Bengali
poets. They were both excellent oriental scholars who were also great
exponents of  the English language.

Interestingly, Bose served as a visiting Professor at the University of
Indiana at Bloomington and Columbia in the 60s. Beloit Poetry Journal and
Prarie Schooner had published him then.

Amiya Chakravarty was Tagore's literary secretary from 1926 to 1933. Later
he served as Professor Emeritus of Comparative Oriental Religion and
Literature at Boston University.

I'd love to see you at what I hope is the first of
many literary events on the Cal State San Marcos
campus. Details below:


Please join us on Thursday, April 6 at 7 p.m. in the
Grand Salon at M. Gordon Clarke Field House for a
reading in the Community and World Literary Series at
California State University, San Marcos, featuring
Sherre Myers and K. Lorraine Graham.

Sherre Myers is a freelance writer and an educator.
She earned her Master’s degree at CSUSM, where she
taught GEW 101 and LTWR 225. Her writing credits
include poems published in The Oyez Review,
Tapestries, New Writings and Perigee. Green Ink Wings,
her first work in fiction, won the 2005 chapbook award
from Elixir Press. She has received recognition for
her writing from Bright Hill Press (Honorable Mention)
and the CPU Creative Writing Conference (Second
Place). Myers lives in Los Angeles with her writing
partner J.T. Vernon and is currently working on a
creative non-fiction collection memorializing the life
and death of her brother, Christopher Sellers.

K. Lorraine Graham recently moved from Washington, DC
to the San Diego area. She is the author of two
chapbooks: Dear [Blank] I Believe in Other Worlds
(Phylum) and Terminal Humming (Slack Buddha). Ron
Silliman writes that "Terminal Humming is a series of
untitled prose pieces that join philosophy to
sensation in ways that remind me fondly of Kathy
Acker...My sense is that Graham is pushing her work as
hard as possible – the ambition evident in just a few
short pages is breath-taking " Her work has appeared
or is forthcoming in Magazine Cypress, No Tell Motel,
Rock Heals, Submodern Fiction, Dusie, and elsewhere.
This winter, Narrowhouse Recordings will release
Moving Walkways, a limited-edition CD of her work.
Lorraine has taught poetry and memoir at the Corcoran
College of Art + Design in Washington, DC. In
addition, she edits Anomaly Press, which recently
published Lyrical Eddies: poems after the music of
marilyn crispell, by Jefferson Hansen.

Event Information:
Thursday, April 6, 7 p.m.
Grand Salon

AJThanks for taking the time to fashion your reply.
But I notice a problem.
The Chinese administration is not worse than the US one just because
it tortures etc. its own citizens instead of bombing a lot of countries=20=

that are smaller.
It is a terrorist nation all right, by a very useful definition that=20
says
that any country that manufactures and retains nuclear weapons is a=20
terrorist nation.
And of course  the worst would be any of those that drops nuclear=20
weapons on another country.
I can't remember right now how many of those there have been.

George and all,

To some degree, quibbling over which great power
is the worst offender on an abstract or practical
scale, can -- as is perhaps true with many cases
of applying comparative logic -- have the downside
of obscuring interesting and noteworthy nuances,
human truths discernible even among the 2nd-tierers,
Avises, and also-rans.  The issue of who is the
Worst-of-the-worst, is not the only worthy issue!

Those interested in more concrete details may find
this blog merits study -- with special reference to
the alleged "organ harvesting death camps" of Sujiatun:

http://ahdu88.blogspot.com/

-- an allegation one need not assume to be true till
more fully corraborated; -- but one which gives pause.

cheers,
d.i.

Friends,
I'm pleased to forward this announcement at the request of Annette
Debo, co-chair of the H D Society:

The H.D. International Society has some exciting news about a project
important to the study of H.D.  The Co-Chairs of the H.D. Society,
Annette Debo and Lara Vetter, have received approval from MLA to begin
work on Approaches to Teaching H.D.'s Poetry and Prose, notice of which
appeared in the latest MLA Newsletter.  We are in the process of sending
out questionnaires to teachers of H.D. that ask for information about
how you teach H.D. and request abstracts for short essays to be
considered for that volume.  We would very much like you to participate.

These threads that assert that the US government, because of its excesses is
equal to the regime in Communist China is silly and simply ludicrous.

China has secret labor camps, has killed over 100 million of its own people,
and is today doing everything in its power not to open

To bring this type of logic we get here on the list to its rational end, we
should not have fought Hitler because at the same time the British were
oppressing the Indians and he US had Jim Crow laws in the 1930's? Hitler and
the US and Britain were all morally equal?

The fact is that those people who live in Western Europe, the US, Japan
Australia and other moderate Democracies have more freedom than people in
China do and we do not face the kind of general oppression that is part of
many Chinese people's lives.

I have worked in China and I know people there who are suffering Artistic
and Religious persecution.

I have a good friend who is in detention because he had a photo of Pope John
Paul II and an unauthorized Bible that he used to lead a bible study and he
got 5 years-

In Guangzhou last year 250 people died from over work one woman worked for
89 hours without sleep-

Poets need to oppose oppression here in the US but to equate our situation
with what Chinese people suffer is ludicrous

George and all,

To some degree, quibbling over which great power is the worst offender on an
abstract or practical scale, can -- as is perhaps true with many cases of
applying comparative logic -- have the downside of obscuring interesting and
noteworthy nuances, human truths discernible even among the 2nd-tierers,
Avises, and also-rans.  The issue of who is the Worst-of-the-worst, is not
the only worthy issue!

Those interested in more concrete details may find this blog merits study --
with special reference to the alleged "organ harvesting death camps" of
Sujiatun:

-- an allegation one need not assume to be true till more fully
corraborated; -- but one which gives pause.

The United States should be leading the way to a world in which the military
power of individual nations is less than the military power of the United
Nations or a similar collective of the world's nations. It isn't. Instead,
the USA acts unilaterally and invades other nations. The USA acts as though
it cares not at all for international law. This is not only criminal but
sets a disastrous example to other nations as to how to proceed in the
world.

The United States should be leading the way to a world in which we are not
hastening global environmental disaster. Instead, the USA did not sign the
Kyoto accord and the USA is controlled by oil men who are more interested in
short term profits than the long term environmental health of the world.

The United States should be leading the way to a world where religious
fanatics do not have substantial political power. Not by killing them all,
but by leading with reason and compassion, presenting a successful
alternative. Instead, George Bush sees himself as chosen by God and has
deeply undermined the separation of church and state that has been one of
the cornerstones of USAmerican society.

The current USA administration has established rule by fear, by xenophobia,
blatantly justifies torture of detainees, indefinite imprisonment without
trial, and is turning the USA into an even more repressive police state than
it has been for a long time.

Regardless of which is worse, China or the USA, the important thing is that
the governments of both are equally culpable--both portend a bleak future
for the world.

Not that the Canadian government (which is where I'm from) is a beacon of

Subject: Re: favorite long poems - H.D.'s Trilogy

One of my favorite long poems is "Exercises for Ear"
by Stephen Jonas.  Oh man, he's fantastic!

BUT, my FAVORITE NEW LONG POEM HANDS DOWN
is the amazing OBEDIENCE by kari edwards!

if you haven't read this newest book by kari edwards
(from Factory School:
_http://www.factoryschool.org/pubs/heretical/vol1/edwards/05edwardsCOV.jpg_
(http://www.factoryschool.org/pubs/heretical/vol1/edwards/05edwardsCOV.jpg)
)
pick it up, it's without a doubt one of the best new books of poetry!
AND, one of the best book-length poems I've ever read!
It's up there with Notley's The Descent of Alette.

When kari read in Philadelphia recently I was literally SPELLBOUND
by her reading.  You had to see it to know what I'm talking about,  and
I wish it was on video.  She has this way of reading while standing  on
the outside rims of her shoes, rising into that stance, then falling  in
measure. Well, not a measure conducted by the poem, it's almost as
if there's a power rising up into her, and through her, as she reads,
rising to the outside rims again and falling suddenly, over and over.
And with that the SPEED of the reading, which never lets you not
follow or listen, but the energy she builds has a way of never  letting
go for a solid thirty minutes, and when she stops reading you are
hanging high in the air with it.

Very glad I got to witness that!  She lives in India now, so who  knows
when we'll get to see her read again here in the states.

When talking about her new book she asked that we read it in one
sitting.  But to be honest I'm a bit addicted to it, and don't want  to
have it be over that SOON.  Here's my latest favorite part:

"dear absent,
I speak
fighting would be absent pain
in a single thing
a place
a state identity
hung about the body
not happening
frozen - not crossing
situated never resembling
a musical deviation
reconsidered in tones and intervals
halfway between confusion and total glossolalia
a thing invented in fiction
that disguises the body
as a universal object"

You are completely correct the America of Whitman, Franklin Roosevelt,
George Marshall and Mrs Roosevelt has been stolen from us and we as
Americans need to fight for that America but the mass of Americans will not
be won over by hyperbole;

If we actually had a real opposition party that could challenge Americans to
be that Nation that we all want it to be but we have become a globalized
world where corporations and their needs mean more than silly ideas like the
Declaration of Independence, Declarations of the Rights of Man and Citizen
or the Bill of Rights

April 2006.

The two-day conference will feature an international cast of speakers
with a special emphasis on younger and emerging scholars. As indicated

Duncan's work after 1968. Confirmed speakers include: Gra=E7a Capinha,
Stephen Collis, Nesrin Eruysal, Stephen Fredman, Jeff Hamilton, Lisa
Jarnot, Devin Johnston, Eric Keenaghan, James Maynard, Peter O'Leary,
Cl=E9ment Oudart, Brian Reed, John Taggart, Dennis Tedlock, Kimberlee
Winter, and Thomas Yorty.

All presentations, which are open to the public, will take place in The
Poetry Collection's Reading Room, 420 Capen Hall on UB's North Campus.
They are scheduled from 12:45 to 5:00 pm on Friday, April 21 and from
10:00 am to 5:00 pm on Saturday, April 22.  There will also be two
special poetry readings:

Fri. April 21, 8:00 pm - JOHN TAGGART - UB Art Gallery, Center for the
Arts (2nd Floor Gallery).

Sat. April 22 - STEPHEN COLLIS, JEFF HAMILTON, LISA JARNOT, DEVIN

Here's a small start. Instead of using the term 'America', use USAmerica or,
in speech, "the United States". Instead of 'American', use 'USAmerican'.
America is much larger than the United States. There's North America,
Central America, and South America. When USAmericans call their country
America, it disregards the rest of the Americas, as though the USA was all
of it. A little bit of intercontinental awareness in what and who you call
yourself would be a good but very small start on a big problem.

I think we can all agree that both Chinese and US government have problems,
both large and small. We should also agree that both governments have done
and are even today doing good things. I hope we can all agree that we have a
duty, as well as the possibility, to work for more good and less bad.



I write this to say that I don't see any necessary competition between China
and the US in terms of which is worse. But things do get interesting when we
start asking these questions, or when we start asking how which government
is worse rather than simply which is worse.



I'm clear that from the perspective of those within these countries, the
Chinese government is more oppressive. The chance that your government will
kill you or imprison you is greater if your government is Chinese than if
it's the US. I'd rather be a poet or a dissident in the US than in China.



But I'm also sure that from the perspective of those outside these
countries, the US is a greater threat. The chances that the US will kill or
imprison you is greater than that China will kill you if you are in Iraq,
Nigeria, France, or Canada. It's probably the same everywhere in the world,
with the exception perhaps of Nepal and Taiwan. But then, from the Chinese
government's point of view, Taiwan is part of China anyway. If I were a poet
or dissident or labor leader anywhere in the world aside from the US and
China, I'd be more afraid of the US than China (I might even take help from
China if it meant I could fight the US).



Are these hard points to accept? Is China worse to its own people than the
US is to everyone else? Does discussing China's oppression keep us from
focusing on how to improve the US, or does focusing on the US's problems
keep us blind to the oppression that happens in China? I think these
questions are both more interesting and more pressing than simply whether
China or the US is the bigger monster.



And finally, as someone who has lived in the US and China, and will always
be spending time in both those countries, I should point out that I love
many things about these places that both have nothing to do with the
government and have a lot to do with the government. It's this love that
inspires me to work, in both countries, to overcome what I find oppressive
in both places.

Jim,
I like your thought process, and I confess to having been guilty of =
claiming exclusive ownership of the word "American;" I'll amend that =
practice.  =20

But I still dislike the inference in all the messages that generalize =
the population of any country, no matter which, with the deeds of =
misguided or worse, evil leaders. =20

Bowering's comment lacks credibility because it too lacks specificity to =
the culprits...how simple it is to lump sum toss the lot of us (U.S. =
Americans) into the pot with GWB, or for that matter, any specific =
administration of any country, past or present.   Is Truman guilty of =
having dropped the bomb?  Yep!  And what I like about Harry Truman, from =
what I've read, is he never tried to lay blame elsewhere.  Was it a =
right thing to drop those bombs?  (I have my views), but the fact is: =
who the hell knows!  More importantly, Harry stood up and said, I did =
what I thought I had to do.  And it was not, despite the assertion of =
George Bowering, the U.S. American people who made that decision...it =
was one man, doing what he thought was his job. Perhaps George Bowering =
should spend more time reading the works of Conrad and less time =
rereading his own works...he might be better prepared to answer the =
question, "What would he have done?"  I've read (and enjoyed) a good =
many of George's earlier works...I'm convinced he hasn't a clue how he'd =
have behaved had he been in Harry Truman's shoes during those days. =
(And, no, I've no idea how or what I'd have done in HST's circumstances =
either.  Who among us knows her/himself well enough to say with =
certainty how we'd act under specific circumstances?)=20

Has the world had evil creatures in positions of authority?  Duh?  Hell, =
Universities have evil (read stupid) people in authority (read =
professors), is the University evil?   I don't think so.

Should we hold the world's population accountable for the misdeeds of =
miscreants?  I don't think so. =20

Is U.S. America free from having produced its share of miscreant idiots? =
 Hell no!  And if the nation is lucky enough to continue as a nation, =
will it produce other idiot leaders?  No doubt it will!=20

Twice, I voted against George W. Bush, each time to no avail.  What am I =
guilty of in the morass of the deaths in Iraq?  I'm guilty of not having =
worked harder to defeat the idiot who authorized the dropping of the =
bombs.  But it is the idiot himself who is guilty of having dropped =
those bombs...not me, not U.S. Americans. =20

Is this a topic fit for discussion on a site dedicated to poetics and =
advancing the art and craft of poetry?  You bet your sweet butt it is.  =
This is the stuff that makes emotions boil over!  And emotions lie at =
the very heart of poetry. =20

Labels

label me citizen
don't though
label me leader

leaders
decide

leaders
deride

leaders
hide
what's on their mind.

label me other

label me lover
of humankind...

And, Jim, thanks for your insight; you have altered the behavior of at =
least one reader. =20

I don't think that's what George was saying, Alexander. Someone said "I find
it hypocritical for Americans to dwell on Chinese politics when the real
monster in the world today is America." George replied "No it isn't. It is
the United States."

He was distinguishing, as I have, between 'America' and 'the United States'.
America is as large as North, Central, and South America combined.

If it makes you feel any better, we too have idiotic and sometimes even
downright evil leaders in Canada. Only they can't screw the whole world as
violently as the super-powers.

No, Jim.
Someone (Dean B.) equated America with China, and in that equation, he =
wrote all citizens down as equal to the administration.=20

GB corrected that reference from "America"  to the "United States"=20

But that is the same over-generalization...we are not they!

Later, someone decried George's comment.

To which he replied with examples of the past, ending with references to =
the bombs of HST
again, equating the masses with the majesty. Such nonsense!

I agree with you,
I am a U.S. American
I am not either:
a Canadian
a Mexican
a South American...
though,
neither am I a bomber...it is that "general, over generalization" to =
which I object, and of which G.B. is guilty of alluding.=20

And it was George who focused on the United States, not differentiating =
the administration's views from the citizens views. =20

I object to that categorization. I find that thought process feeble and =
thoughtless.  Feeble from the standpoint that it requires no intellect =
to over-generalize and thoughtless in that it condemns in broad sweeping =
generalities. =20

I'm off to sleep. =20

I lived in Latin America from 1992 until 1999 I speak Spanish, Portuguese

unfortunately there is no work Unitedstateian in English-

So happy to have sparked debate.=20

May I ask (Alex) that you please not put words into my mouth. I never =
equated China with U.S.  Let's clean house before disparaging other =
countries with such base comparisons with our own country (government =
and people), which should shame us all. The Chinese government has lots =
of problems to deal with and make most Chinese that I know proud=97the =
healthy dissent, suggested in the satire I translated, not withstanding. =
If you aren't ashamed of the U.S., step out of the media bubble and into =
the world (go anywhere or live without TV and decolonize).=20

Speculate all you will, the actual menace today in the world is the U.S. =

Internal affairs of other countries is indeed complex, and as an =
American citizen (who likely will indeed leave it) I avoid reinforcing =
this postcolonial Eurocentric notion that Europeans and Americans can =
give advice to other nations. Sure I sign petitions to free imprisoned =
scholars, but I do not demonize the Chinese government. I do feel =
comfortable demonizing the current U.S. administration, and the people =
(known as =93Americans=94 last time I checked)--regardless of how they =
voted, for not having the brains and will to rise up. (I did what I =
could, formed a poetry reading forum when everyone in Tacoma was silent =
and passive, fearful. I wheat-pasted giant posters for the event against =
the war around town just to save us a trace of humanity. Of the dozen or =
so who showed up the first reading, one was an F.B.I. agent or =
informant. Thanks be to American freedoms=85.)=20

I suggested that the real menace in the world is--no contest--the U.S. =
(known by usage as America here and in Japan at least, though Latin =
Americans don't care for this imperialistic and assuming =
transcontinental name (as if America were central to all the Americas, =
which ain't gonna happen anytime soon thanks to the =93bad PR=94 by the =
openly imperialistic U.S. government and its docile people, the =
Americans=97whose docility frightens people abroad as much as Bush=92s =
bombast).

Objecting to categories is not enough. The world is still breathing out =
there and tossing rings.=20

No, Jim.
Someone (Dean B.) equated America with China, and in that equation, he =
wrote all citizens down as equal to the administration.=20

GB corrected that reference from "America"  to the "United States"=20

But that is the same over-generalization...we are not they!

Later, someone decried George's comment.

To which he replied with examples of the past, ending with references to =
the bombs of HST
again, equating the masses with the majesty. Such nonsense!

I agree with you,
I am a U.S. American
I am not either:
a Canadian
a Mexican
a South American...
though,
neither am I a bomber...it is that "general, over generalization" to =
which I object, and of which G.B. is guilty of alluding.=20

And it was George who focused on the United States, not differentiating =
the administration's views from the citizens views. =20

I object to that categorization. I find that thought process feeble and =
thoughtless.  Feeble from the standpoint that it requires no intellect =
to over-generalize and thoughtless in that it condemns in broad sweeping =
generalities. =20

I'm off to sleep. =20

  I don't think that's what George was saying, Alexander. Someone said =
"I find
  it hypocritical for Americans to dwell on Chinese politics when the =
real
  monster in the world today is America." George replied "No it isn't. =
It is
  the United States."

  He was distinguishing, as I have, between 'America' and 'the United =
States'.
  America is as large as North, Central, and South America combined.

  If it makes you feel any better, we too have idiotic and sometimes =
even
  downright evil leaders in Canada. Only they can't screw the whole =
world as
  violently as the super-powers.

  YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT CHINA, U.S> BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
  and yesterday I posted a reading with a real LIVE POET a LIVE POET
  who is Chinese who was oppressed, who had his bones broken, his body imprisoned because he SPOKE THE TRUTH as a poet should do and NOT ONE PERSON SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. It reminds me of The Grand Inquistor in The Brothers Karamazov where Jesus' return is impeded because it doesn't fit into the plans of the Christian Church. You want to talk about China, about oppression, about the U.S. and no one is even talking about the American government's complicity with abuses because of business/favored nation status: then go and attend these readings where poets who are Chinese can tell you the truth.
  I mean if you are interested in that.

  HERE IS THE INFO AGAIN:

   Refusing Silence:
 The Life and Poetry of Huang Xiang

  On May 2, 2006 beginning at 1pm at SUNY Stony Brook University's
Charles Wang Cultural Center Lecture Hall 1, Movement One: Creative
Coalition will present "Refusing Silence: The Life and Poetry of Huang Xiang."
Currently a resident in The Cities of Asylum Program with his wife, the
writer Qiu Ziao Yulan, Huang Xiang is a poet of conscience who was
imprisoned twelve years in China because of his role as an organizer of the
Democracy Wall Movement. Huang Xiang is author of over twenty books,
all of which are still banned in his native China.
  The program will feature Huang Xiang reading his own poetry in
Chinese. There will also be readings of Andrew Emerson's English translations
of Xiang's poetry.
  The readings will be preceded by the showing of a short documentary
featuring Huang Xiang and Qiu Xiao Yulan. Reception to follow. The
program is free and open to the public.
  Movement One: Creative Coalition is a New York based arts non-profit
which organizes and supports projects that promote inter-cultural
dialogue. Amongst other things, Movement One organizes the annual Queens
International Poetry Festival.

  Jim,
I like your thought process, and I confess to having been guilty of claiming exclusive ownership of the word "American;" I'll amend that practice.

But I still dislike the inference in all the messages that generalize the population of any country, no matter which, with the deeds of misguided or worse, evil leaders.

Bowering's comment lacks credibility because it too lacks specificity to the culprits...how simple it is to lump sum toss the lot of us (U.S. Americans) into the pot with GWB, or for that matter, any specific administration of any country, past or present. Is Truman guilty of having dropped the bomb? Yep! And what I like about Harry Truman, from what I've read, is he never tried to lay blame elsewhere. Was it a right thing to drop those bombs? (I have my views), but the fact is: who the hell knows! More importantly, Harry stood up and said, I did what I thought I had to do. And it was not, despite the assertion of George Bowering, the U.S. American people who made that decision...it was one man, doing what he thought was his job. Perhaps George Bowering should spend more time reading the works of Conrad and less time rereading his own works...he might be better prepared to answer the question, "What would he have done?" I've read (and enjoyed) a good many of George's
 earlier works...I'm convinced he hasn't a clue how he'd have behaved had he been in Harry Truman's shoes during those days. (And, no, I've no idea how or what I'd have done in HST's circumstances either. Who among us knows her/himself well enough to say with certainty how we'd act under specific circumstances?)

Has the world had evil creatures in positions of authority? Duh? Hell, Universities have evil (read stupid) people in authority (read professors), is the University evil? I don't think so.

Should we hold the world's population accountable for the misdeeds of miscreants? I don't think so.

Is U.S. America free from having produced its share of miscreant idiots? Hell no! And if the nation is lucky enough to continue as a nation, will it produce other idiot leaders? No doubt it will!

Twice, I voted against George W. Bush, each time to no avail. What am I guilty of in the morass of the deaths in Iraq? I'm guilty of not having worked harder to defeat the idiot who authorized the dropping of the bombs. But it is the idiot himself who is guilty of having dropped those bombs...not me, not U.S. Americans.

Is this a topic fit for discussion on a site dedicated to poetics and advancing the art and craft of poetry? You bet your sweet butt it is. This is the stuff that makes emotions boil over! And emotions lie at the very heart of poetry.

Here's a small start. Instead of using the term 'America', use USAmerica or,
in speech, "the United States". Instead of 'American', use 'USAmerican'.
America is much larger than the United States. There's North America,
Central America, and South America. When USAmericans call their country
America, it disregards the rest of the Americas, as though the USA was all
of it. A little bit of intercontinental awareness in what and who you call
yourself would be a good but very small start on a big problem.

I think that's a little to the extreme.  Why not just use US instead of
America? I think the reason we use America in the first place is that it's a
simple extension to American.  To remedy this, I suggest we refer to
ourselves as the US and the inhabitants as USers.

It strikes me - now that Iraq has obviously become an unmitigated disaster -
that this country's right wing has diverted its limitless killer energies to
the latino/Hispanic migrant populations. The new Moby, apparently, has now
become 11 million "criminal felon illegal" -  brown residents. Victory over
them apparently will re-purify a particular definition of the nation, etc.,
etc. without all that messy democracy, Arab nation-building  nonsense

It also strikes me a wonderful that the Hispanic population is not taking
this lying down. (Ironic how the Foxies are trying to dumb down the protests
by saying they are ignited by DJ's! And those Mexican flags! I am sure glad
the Italian and Irish and whoever else Americans do not parade holding up
their country flags in x and y parades. I would be worried!).

In the context of this list, I want to ask the role of poets/poetry in what
is clearly a huge domestic (national) eruption. The list has been rather
deaf here (tho clearly rumpled by China!). Along with those DJ's, where is
the language most active in responding to the traffic back and forth across
the borders.  Maybe Charles Alexander - both publishing and teaching in the
heart of Tucson can speak to his knowledge of this pulse(??).  And I suspect
there are others - Mark Weiss, for example, tho now in New York, was deeply
involved with the Poets of Tiajuana and Baja.

Seems real timely to know. And if there is not, that is something to know,
too.

My anthology, Across the Line / Al otro lado: The Poetry of Baja
California, covers a lot of it from that side on that segment of the
border, except for the very youngest poets. I'll be there at the end
of April and report back anything interesting I learn. On the US side
(again of that border) the dominant voices are connected to the Taco
Shop Poets. They have a web site,
http://vozalta.u33.infinology.com/tsp/. Check out within the site the
pages for Voz Alta, the art and poetry series they sponsor. Anybody
there would be pretty knowledgeable and forthcoming. I know Adrian
Arancibia best. If anyone emails Voz Alta give my regards. They could
also supply the names of writers in the important Juarez (opposite El
Paso) fiction scene (some is translated. The poetry isn't
particularly impressive). For prose from the Baja border check out
the catalogue of SDSU Press. The bulk of what's been translated is
there, many in sterling versions by Harry Polkinhorn.

I'd recommend anything by Luis Alberto Urrea, who was raised on both
sides of the border. He's published a few novels (I haven't read the
latest, The Hummingbird's Daughter) and a couple of books of poetry,
but the place to start is his non-fiction, Across the Wire : Life and
Hard Times on the Mexican Border, By the Lake of Sleping Children,
and The Devil's Highway, a stunning and harrowing account of a
particularly disastrous attempted crossing by a group of Mexican
illegals. It helps to have a strong stomach.

A good overview of the border, tho it's a bit out of date in the
details, is Tucson-based journalist Tom Miller's On the Border.

I hope this helps.

Vernon, Skip, Ric, et al.,

Sorry I'm getting to this a bit late.  In my project, each
"chapter" of the sequence is numbered sequentially, so
there's a logical beginning and end: threshold to
threshold, the door of my house to the office door at work
(the project covers my morning walk, so no reverse
direction on the way home).  The chapters have been
re-mapped back to the physical locations on the walk where
I heard the original sounds that inspire the work.  So, on
a base level, the poem unfolds as a reenactment of the
walk, although there's nothing to prevent a reader from
dipping into it in alternate configurations, just as my
fifteen years of walking variations of the same route take
on a more nuanced system of overlaps and jumps in
memory/history/geography, a palimpsest.  And, even reading
the sequence from start to finish, there really isn't any
kind of narrative linearity.

The sequence structure of numbering serves as just that: a
structure, or scaffolding, upon which to initiate
meditations and improvisations on sounds as triggers or
starting points.  An annotated bibliography (catalog), in
a way.

Best,

G.
