>  The Dream of the Audience is a retrospective exhibition of the works of
Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, an influential but little known Korean-American
artist who worked in media ranging from performance, film and video to mail
art and artist's books. An ongoing exploration of themes born out of
personal experience-primarily those of geographic exile and cultural and
linguistic displacement-Cha's complex work is distinguished by multiple
cultural references and languages, including Korean, French and English. The
exhibition will feature extensive documentation of Cha's performances, video
and film installations, sculpture, artist's books, works on paper and
documentation relating to the unfinished film White Dust from Mongolia,
which Cha was working on at the time of her murder in New York in 1982 at
the age of 31. The show also will include an on-line presence.
>
>  Cha moved with her family from Korea to San Francisco in 1964 and
> eventually received four degrees from UC Berkeley - a B.A. (1973) in
comparative literature, and a B.A. (1975), M.A. (1977), and M.F.A. (1978) in
art practice. During the last two years of her short life she lived in New
York, where she created her final work, the book Dictée. An altogether
original conception and remarkable in its scope for a young artist, Dictée
combines family history, auto-biography, stories of female martyrdom,
poetry, and images, and touches on all the major themes of her work:
language, memory, displacement, and alienation.
>
>  Cha has been described as strong, fragile, ambitious, reticent,
> emotional,disciplined, tragic, funny, hypersensitive, pure, and
intelligent. She was probably all of these. How she and her work might have
developed and changed we will never know.
>
>
>  On the occasion of the opening of the exhibition, "The Dream of the
>  Audience," an interdisciplinary panel of distinguished speakers will
> present a multi-faceted discussion of the work of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha.
Her work has become increasingly important and relevant to a broad range of
disciplines--from ethnic studies, Asian American Studies, and women's
studies to film, literature, and linguistics, as well as visual and
performance and art.

GOSSIP by Thomas Fink and ARBOR VITAE by Jane Augustine.

Wednesday, January 16th, 6 to 8 PM.
Teachers & Writers Collaborative, 5 Union Square West, 7th Floor, NYC.

Marsh Hawk Press takes its name from the strong, independent, wide-ranging
bird found everywhere in America's open spaces, and not too close to solid,
built-up ground.  Our books present forms and sensibilities that have
assimilated modern and post-modern traditions but expand from these without
political or aesthetic bias, outside of "schools" yet with affinities to the
visual arts.  Making use of the most up-to-date technology, we aim to
produce handsome, affordable books to sustain readers of poetry.  Five
volumes will appear in 2001-2002 with at least five to follow in the next
year.

Why grammar is the first casualty of war

                    By Terry Jones, Monty Python member, writer and
                    performer
                    (Filed: 01/12/2001)

                    WHAT really alarms me about President Bush's "war on
                    terrorism" is the grammar. How do you wage war on an
                    abstract noun? It's rather like bombing murder.

                    Imagine if Bush had said: "We're going to bomb murder
                    wherever it lurks. We are going to seek out the
                    murderers and the would-be murderers, and bomb any
                    government that harbours murderers."

                    The other thing that worries me about Bush and Blair's
                    "war on terrorism" is: how will they know when they've
                    won it? With most wars, you can say you've won when the
                    other side is either all dead or surrenders. But how is
                    terrorism going to surrender?

                    It's hard for abstract nouns to surrender. In fact it's very
                    hard for abstract nouns to do anything at all of their own
                    volition - even trained philologists can't negotiate with
                    them. It's difficult to find their hide-outs, useless to
                    try to
                    cut off their supplies.

                    The bitter semantic truth is that you can't win against
                    these sort of words - unless, I suppose, you get them
                    thrown out of the Oxford English Dictionary. That would
                    show 'em. Admittedly, the Second World War was fought
                    against fascism.

                    But that particular abstract noun was cunningly hiding
                    behind the very real Nazi government. We simply had to
                    defeat Germany to win. In President Bush's war, there is
                    no such solution. Saying "We will destroy terrorism" is
                    about as meaningful as saying: "We shall annihilate
                    mockery."

                    Moreover, in its current usage, terrorism cannot be
                    committed by a country. When America bombed a
                    Sudanese pharmaceutical factory under the impression
                    that it was a chemical weapons establishment, that was
                    stupid. But it was not an act of terrorism because the US
                    Government did it officially. And it apologised for it.

                    That's very important: no self-respecting terrorist ever
                    apologises. It's one of the few things that distinguishes
                    legitimate governments from terrorists. So, it was difficult
                    for President Bush to know whom to bomb after the World
                    Trade Centre outrage.

                    If Bermuda had done it, then it would have been simple:
                    he could have bombed the Bahamas. It must have been
                    really irritating that the people who perpetrated such a
                    horrendous catastrophe were not a nation.

                    What's more, terrorists - unlike a country - won't keep
                    still in one place so you can bomb them. They have this
                    annoying habit of moving around, sometimes even going
                    abroad. It's all very un-American (apart from the training,
                    that is).

                    On top of all this, you have no idea who the terrorists are.
                    It's in their nature not to be known until they've
                    committed their particular act of terrorism. Otherwise,
                    they're just plain old Tim McVeigh who lives next door, or
                    that nice Mr Atta who's taking flying lessons.

                    So, let's forget the abstract noun. Let's rename this
                    conflict the "war on terrorists"; that sounds a bit more
                    concrete. But, actually, the semantics get even more
                    obscure. What exactly does President Bush mean by
                    terrorists? He hasn't defined the term, so we'll have to
                    try
                    to work out what he means from his actions.

                    Judging by those actions, the terrorists all live together
                     in
                    "camps" in Afghanistan. Presumably, they spend the
                    evenings playing the guitar and eating chow around the
                    campfire. In these "camps", the terrorists also engage in
                    "training" and stockpiling weapons, which we can
                    obliterate with our cluster bombs and missiles.

                    Nobody seems to have told the President that the horrors
                    of September were perpetrated with little more than a
                    couple of dozen box-cutters. I suppose the US could
                    bomb all the stockpiles of box-cutters in the world, but I
                    have a sneaking feeling that it's still not going to
                    eradicate terrorists.

                    Besides, I thought the terrorists who crashed those planes
                    into the World Trade Centre were living in Florida and
                    New Jersey. I thought the al-Qa'eda network was
                    operating in 64 countries, including America and many
                    European states - which even President Bush might prefer
                    not to bomb.

                    But no: the President, Congress, Tony Blair and pretty
                    well the entire House of Commons are convinced that
                    terrorists live in Afghanistan. And what is meant by:
                     "We
                    mustn't give in to the terrorists"? We gave in to them the
                    moment the first bombs fell on Afghanistan.

                    The instigators of September 11 must have been popping
                    the corks on their non-alcoholic champagne. They had
                    successfully provoked America into attacking yet another
                    poor country it didn't previously know much about,
                    thereby creating revulsion throughout the Arab world and
                    ensuring support for the Islamic fundamentalists.

                    Words have become devalued, some have changed their
                    meaning, and the philologists can only shake their heads.
                    The first casualty of war is grammar.

Alan. As ever I'm fascinated by this. Is this the intersection of or one of
the "nodes" of your shorter and longer waves? Good - interesting  - the way
you "analyse" the painting and the painting alsomost tlks to the "reader"
...obliquely it reminded me of  Kafka's thing about a thing building and
rebuilding a defence in a burrow...although that was just something that
occurred to me...I like the "Cartesian fetishization of the real" .....  an
inteesting take on phenomenom and reality art writing etc: I still havent
had time (you put so much on!!) to study your CD etc and have a good peruse
but the pieces that are coming out are always interesting or different. At
least you're doing things instead of announcing awards or books or readings:
getting on with the job. Peoplemight critique you but meantime you've
probably produced another 10 works!  Good on you. Best for the New Year Alan
etal on The List.  Richard.

Geoffrey.

Point taken: better as a kind of etoliated James Bond [ by the way some book
dealers pay 1000 British pounds just for the dust wrappers of James Bond
books!]...we seem to need "heroes"  (not only the movie industry's "fault"
you can blame Homer etc). True Martin Luther was a great man: Bin is a bit
vague about what he wants although I think we should try to understand why
such as him arise ... its not all over, by the way you said dominate the
word! Very good. Bush etal seem to want that: the world and the word...there
no obviously "bad" nations but the capitalist-Imerialist system is still
(deep down) very frightened that the protests and the various wars will lead
to a real worker's state: ultimately if we survive a possible nuclear
holocaust we need a real democracy not the phoney stuff that exists every
where ( not just pointing at the US: also India and others ) ..bin Laden,
much to the infuriation of Rumsford IS probably becoming a hero to millions
of young men throughout the world: not that he is is or is not courageous or
even good: its what he sems to represent: put it this way, we all hate
authority, and the US-British hegemony (and the oher Western antions) are
like the Policemen of the World: the ones we fear but love to hate (yet
sometimes we call on them for help) ( a kind of Freudian love-hate thing )
... So some young man in Beverly hills with two Phds in electronics or
whatever will be sitting alone (he never ventures out) and plotting (not to
be  a boring old serial kiler who listens to weird music and rapes
Hemmingway's daughter  (!) (forget the name of the film)) but a Great
Terrrorist on the bin Laden model...who was the CIA's Frankenstein!!!
  But eg to be able to "get inside " bin Laden would take someone of the
immense power of a Faulkner: that great American writer...one of the
greatest writers ever... not a Joyce: he was too timid (if  not also an
equally great writer...)(if we  can talk about great writers)...truth is
stranger ... oh well, I must get back to doing some actual writing rather
than all this "reality" how did Allan describe reality in his latest "poem"
...?
  Or is bin a bit of a Lawrence of Arabia type? (Movies again this time.)
The US badly  needed to humiliate bin-Baby: capture and humiliate, but like
Hitler and some of the 'baddies' in Fleming, he's escaped - like Moriarty in
fact! - nearly become a maytr  - contrast Mussolini (who was actually shot
in a field then after hung upside down) that's very bad publicity to end up
upside down: he let the side down: I mean down...but Hitler still
fascinates: evil fascintes as much as "good" witness Darth Vader, and
Milton giving so much space to Saint Nick: and Blake's  "The Devil is
Eternal Energy"...
  Dangerous these poets (was it Plato who warned against poets?): powerful
and hurtful the Word: the Logos.....
  Why write poems when the reality outside is like a bizarre dream: more
fantastic than Shakespeare's "Macbeth" or "  The Tempest"....
  Strange word. Words. World. Worlds? Regards. Best for the New Year,
Richard.

Of course he's probably not: he doesnt need to be: he'll be made into a
prophet!! but that doesnt matter: its the very fact of the IDEA of bin
Laden: the US badly need to humiliate him (the Roman's understood that
pocedure but they thougth that Christ was just another nut case probably)
otherwise he becomes a martyr: there's a big nazi movement in Europe now and
it would have helped had Hitler been captured and "humiliated" (like
Mussolini was) but Adolf was one of those figures - like Marlow's
Tamburlane - who is great BECAUSE of the terrible things he did, and because
he kind of "disappeared": no one emembers how he died or even what he was on
about: it doesnt matter ... he fascinates: Bush by contrast and Blair are
boring as well...weak tea. Cheers, Richard.

I thought I'd follow Brian Stefans' tradition of posting "little reviews" by
enclosing below a few things I wrote for my own mag, _The Gig_.  These all
appeared in issue #9.  Issue #10 is due out soon, with an essay on JH Prynne
by Charles Altieri, & poetry by Buck Downs, Gilbert Adair, Leslie Scalapino,
Carla Harryman, Carol Mirakove, Tom Pickard, Martin Corless-Smith & Scott
Thurston. -- Best wishes for 2002! --N

The Harmony of Mutually Divergent Things

Allen Fisher, _Ring Shout._  Equipage, 2000 (c/o Rod Mengham, Jesus College,
Cambridge, CB5 8BL, UK).  16pp.
Allen Fisher, _Sojourns_.  Wild Honey, 2001 (16a Ballyman Road, Bray, Co.
Wicklow, Ireland; www.wildhoneypress.com).  21pp.  $5/£3.50.
Allen Fisher, _Watusi_.  Spanner, 2001 (14 Hopton Road, Hereford, HR1 1BE,
UK; kaa45@dial.pipex.com).  19pp.
Allen Fisher, _Woodpecker_.  Spanner, 2001.  4pp.

Allen Fisher's large-scale project _Gravity as a consequence of shape_ has
preoccupied him since the early 1980s; these four new showings, like the
rest of _Gravity_, take their titles from an alphabetized list of dances
(_Sojourns_ collects poems from "Running in Place" to "Shango," plus two
prose texts which originally appeared in Ideas of the culture dreamed of).
Some of _Gravity_'s compositional procedures can be suggested by examining
part 8 of _Ring Shout_:

Thighs end strain bend switch
Gyrations rim digression in a grim age
roaring escapable muds rim-testing the sod
of a barging roster screwed to the new roarplate
another motorboard rattling the screen-ledge, dog-cronic.

Sonic hedgehog gene patterning
of notochord, floorplate of neural tube
and posterior margin of tetrapod limb buds,
capable of mirror-image limb-digit duplications
which extend to the brain and eyes.

The bereft felt from a Hay diet
relaxing into once lost sexual appetites
kites and apples complex frost, once faxing
the riot day from the spelt relief

Out of a series of enigmatic phrases the words "Sonic hedgehog" turn out to
be unexpectedly tractable: this is, as Fisher notes, "the vernacular name
for the gene Shh," which "encod[es] a secreted protein signal directing
patterning in the embryo."  (_Notochord_: "the flexible rodlike structure of
mesodermal cells that is the principal longitudinal structural element of
chordates and of the early embryo of vertebrates, in both of which it plays
an organizational role in nervous system development" [_Britannica_].)  Not
only does the stanza describe the symmetrical "mirror-image" development of
the embryo: the first stanza is a mirror image of the second ("Sonic
hedgehog" à "ledge, dog-cronic," &c).  Such transformative techniques return
in different form in the third stanza.  The Hay diet is, Fisher tells us, "a
system of food combining" that "avoids the mixture of starch and protein in
the same meal," the brainchild of William Howard Hay (1866-1940).  A
distorted "original" is sometimes perceptible beneath the surface ("bereft"
for "benefit"; "relaxing into" for "regaining" or "restoring"); & this
already-shifted couplet is then mirror-flipped in the last two lines.
   Similar textual shiftings occur throughout these books.  _Woodpecker_
rewrites an earlier _Gravity_ poem, "Atkins Stomp."  _Sojourns_' methodology
seems more various, but systematic repetitions are evident between & within
poems.  Just as the distorted mirror-image form of _Ring Shout_ 8 seems to
hint at the themes of copying, mutation and embryonic growth (genetic
research and cloning are themes that run through all four books), the two
Ideas extracts suggest further analogies between physical and poetic
transformative processes: Fisher notes that pulverizing mercury sulfide
changes its colour from black to vermilion ("The change...isn't a chemical
one, but structural"); & describes types of shear deformation and shear
stress.  _Watusi_'s procedures again seem extraordinarily various, but part
5.v offers one way in:

Now enforce a far unfitter rasp,
For clones burn to change my open needs,
and rave out of nights and
Gentleman's Relish paraded sleep
in long silence
too smashed, the sacred regiment
to raise the ground in leaves of
dull tongue
fetter the wars and loves moralised
as song
rendered inexcusable
in prolepsis
the warning signs
and flesh yield
pulls as they clone
to spark through song
our tendered pants
out throws the cited mode.

This poem touches on traditional poetic rhetorics in its archaisms &
evocations of love and song, but they are almost unrecognizably abraded,
taken over by other languages (notably that of genetic technology).  "Our
tendered pants" makes its point by crossing potentially positive senses (of
tenderness, of offering) with the financial sense of "tender."  High-tech
agriculture may "raise the ground in leaves" or raze it.  Again, this poem
involves textual overlay: the source for lines 1-10 (plus 5.i.8-10) is the
Proem to Book I of _The Faerie Queene_.  There are further interconnections:
"Gentleman's Relish" recalls _Ring Shout_ 9 ("Every jar of Gentleman's
Relish / Banned from the SAS annual dinner") & thus perhaps "the face of an
SAS officer as she / approaches the supermarket" ("Conga," _Dispossession
and Cure_, 1994).
   Such textual procedures raise many questions.  In _Future Exiles_ Robert
Sheppard says that Fisher's work "represent[s] the most serious and
extensive attempt to register late-twentieth-century realities at the level
of both form and content in British poetry today": that "both" bothers me
somewhat, as the smooth and natural linkage implied in it seems to me
unlikely.  Fisher's work is seriously engaged with a whole constellation of
specialist knowledges; it also attempts to formally exemplify his
understanding of them in its constant skewing textual transformations.  But
how might these twin approaches be mutually supportive, given that one might
seem to imply a kind of propositional or referential poetics which could be
considered at odds with textual skews and shifts?  And while I am impressed
by the work's range--to read Fisher is to occupy a larger & more active
world than in virtually any other current poetic practice--I want to know
more about how particular juxtapositions of content might be negotiated as
more than just kaleidoscopic marvels: what might join the themes of
embryonic growth and a Hay diet in _Ring Shout_ 8, or (to take another
instance) "Shag"'s linkage of the Coriolis effect and a tableful of salads?
But I find myself increasingly respectful of, & drawn to, this body of work.
I have not necessarily quoted the parts of it I like most--sometimes these
are the moments where a speech-register suddenly intrudes, whether in a cry
("Stop it!"; "Please don't hurt me") or something stranger & funnier:

Murky taste
it firky waste drain
swindled for the
sake sack
got it? er?
went to bed on head
er?
anuva crop out

These new poems will surely eventually be collected in a full-length volume,
but these elegant chapbooks, several adorned with Fisher's own artwork, are
state-of-the-art poetic bulletins: they should be read.

[some short reviews]

Cathy Wagner, _Hotel Faust_.  West House Books and Gratton Street
Irregulars, 2001 (order from Alan Halsey: 40 Crescent Road, Nether Edge,
Sheffield, S7 1HN, UK; alan@nethedge.demon.co.uk).  17pp. 0-9531509-6-8.
£3.50.

Language & attitude & sexuality in these poems shift fluidly, from a child's
perspective to an adolescent's to an adult's, as in these lines glancing at
the familiar parental injunction about good posture: "eyes at one end cunt
at the other / a swaying hurting wonder between / which is posture perfect
// More glamorough / more pretooty."  "Dear Friends from Lying Down" starts
with three fragments--"ting // ott // s"--marked "Chicago Review or Martin
Chuzzlewit, I forget," & then veers off mercurially: "My name is no longer
Cathy Wagner, it is Pete, Piper Pete / Hair all over my body.  A warm man. /
I have a lengthy cock that weeps for / no one.  Cute! and firm little balls.
/ And grew one vadge lip bigger than the other / that's my pout, some people
have theirs adjusted / I am gorgeous and boyish lately / I have Some Nerve."
The poem's last line is worthy of John James or O'Hara: "I make you a
present of the elbow I'm lying on."  Marvellous & disconcerting work: keep
an eye out too for Wagner's forthcoming Fence book. [Footnote: since this
review appeared the Fence book, _Miss America_, has come out.  It includes
most but not all of _Hotel Faust_, plus _Magazine Poems_ and _Fraction
Anthems_.  It's a terrific book.]
   West House also publishes _A Selection from the Works of Thomas Swan_,
"edited from Worcester City Records Office MS. 8911 by Martin Corless-Smith
& Alan Halsey" (19pp; 0-9531509-7-6; £3.50).  Swan's dates are given as
1653-80 on the back.  The reproduction of variant readings and cancellations
dissolves the poems' already loose quatrains into forms more closely
resembling, say, Susan Howe.  A prose piece on coloured auras (!) is also
printed ("Margaret is soft orange.  William a fresh pale blue").

Not poems, but two series of visual work using collage techniques.  The
first sequence sets musical notation in play with a range of antiquarian
materials; a sample caption: "Sonata for Sir Kenelm Digby and La Fille aux
Yeux d'Or."  The full title of the second sequence is "Preliminary Sketches
Towards the Rebuilding of the Crystal Palace in the Year 2000."

Oakland, CA, 94607, leroy_years@hotmail.com).  22pp, Japanese-bound.  $5 US.

Beautiful, desolate, carefully sifted prose-poems set in "downstate
Illinois," meditating on love, song, place and voice.  The "I" of these
poems never directly addresses a "you," such address only there by
implication in the self's hesitancy--indeed it's remarkable how many
statements in the book are qualified by the phrase "to me" ("To me half a
belief's better by far or one broken into halves").  Here's "Afro-Prairie"
in its entirety: "Tempting for the voice to locate its noise, to speak of or
from.  Everybody wants to be the singer but here's the continent. //
Fielding the question, Do you like good music? // Open love.  In a recurring
dream about the prairie, a thin hedge--along some railroad embankment-in
which there's a gap to step through again and again, for me to step through,
out onto the view itself.  Not the literary ballad, articulated, but out
onto the continent."  _Inland_ contains writing of great compression &
lucidity: recommended.

printer, visual artist, collaborator and translator; his books include _The
Relation Ship_, _A Serial Biography_, _Moving_, _Act_, _Ace_, _Logbook_,
_Writing_, _Clean & Well Lit_ and a selected poems, _Tottering State_ (now
in its 3rd edition, from O Books). _The Gig_'s special issue will be the
first substantial collection of criticism and commentary on a body of

first, bin laden is an "artist" - then one of our correspondents chimes in
with:  "i just like the idea of big buildings crashing down and explosions"

in recent weeks, discussion touching on the current situations has been
awfully trite, perhaps dangerously so.  I have counted on this list for
announcements of new publications, events, and the few thoughtful and
stimulating analyses of poetics and politics that slip through the cracks.
Evidently I can still make the most of the list by checking in to the web
archives periodically.

I'm leaving the list after several years of active participation - mostly
since I can't quite stomach the glibness of late ... such forums as this are
opportune, but opportunism is an abuse.

In parting, let me just add, glibly, that bin Laden is no more of an
"artist" or innovator than Bush (Jerrold's recent post touches on the
fundamental reasoning behind my statement) - I suspect there is a great deal
of egoplay under Bush's skin as his first real business deal was financed by
bin Laden associates - it's like a high school reunion gone horribly wrong,
though not wrong enough - whatever his / their situation(s) may be, there's
far more handicraft than music in those coffers - and the integrity of human
bodies seems like the "lower limit speech" of music to me.  How one can
forward debate over the sickening tyranny of these class and military war
mongers via such dismissive and ill-considered dross is beyond or, most
likely, beneath me.  And it is a class war - make no mistake.  A race war as
well.

Hope the more "concerned" among you will stay tuned to Kenning as it runs
its course through the first half of 2002.

what is the point of this useless, trivial, and murderous exercise?
2002 sticks in the maw of 7 / 11/ 13. what a terrific mouth!
2003 bottoms out, what is called a "prime" as in "steak."
and 2001 comes, what? close to the grain of 23, 29?
better to perform the head-first luge at 80 miles an hour down a chute
than to worry about the palindromic which remains only for a year.
in 6009 we will be upside-down again, better not to perform downhill
ski racing which last killed a world champion smashing into the
machine.
the ski forms its own track within acceptable bounds or boundaries.
leaning against the object of the head-first luge, one comes to the
conclusion that factoring might not have been useless after all.

Philly:  Organizers of the sixth annual Philadelphia Fringe Festival are
conducting a search for risk-taking, boundary-breaking artists.   Centered
in
Old City, last year^^s 16-day festival brought in 35,000 attendees.  This
year
the festival will take place on August 30 - September 14, 2002.

Artists can participate in two ways: through the adjudicated Fringe or by
producing their own work in the Unfiltered Fringe.  Applications are due
February 28th, 2002.  Daring presentations with artistic promise willbe
chosen by diverse panels of artists and arts administrators.  Unfiltered
artists have until May 31st, 2002 to send in their participation form.
The City Paper said that the Fringe is like ^^a circus that magically
appears
and disappears each year.^^

Will take more then a tad of prodding for most of us to appear through
cracks, I personally (have also unsubscribed) find recent posts deadly
boring, more time scrolling less reading, & the same old names, the same old
tunes, tweedledum tweedledee. ho & hum hum, though no blame :-)


 'I know what you're thinking about,' said Tweedledum:  `but it isn't so,
nohow.' `Contrariwise,' continued Tweedledee, `if it was so, it might be;
and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.`I
was thinking,' Alice said very politely, `which is the best way out of this
wood:  it's getting so dark.  Would you tell me, please? But the little men
only looked at each other and grinned.

someone wrote me about kill files back channel - I wonder how many I'm on.
would it be better if I sent my work out once a week, i.e. digest form, to
various lists, instead of daily or whatever the rhythm/frequency. do I
mistake quantity for quality, cycles for relevance?

this is my only mode of distribution; the various books etc. I was
proffered fell through - I'm in various ezines and anthologies, but these
split the discourse of course -

suggestions welcome please - Alan

I don't believe I was offering a definition of any
particular poet, least of all Emily Dickinson. I also don't
mean to suggest that the border between amateur and
"professional" is nonporous. Yet I do think that amateur
poetry -- sentimental is perhaps a better word -- has a
definite aesthetic of its own, and that its history is at
least as long as Gene's comment suggests. My example might
have been the girl in Huckleberry Finn who writes doleful
elegies for everyone in town when they die:

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D

And did young Stephen sicken,
And did young Stephen die?
And did the sad hearts thicken,
And did the mourners cry?

No; such was not the fate of
Young Stephen Dowling Bots;
Though sad hearts round him thickened,
'Twas not from sickness' shots.

No whooping-cough did rack his frame,
Nor measles drear with spots;
Not these impaired the sacred name
Of Stephen Dowling Bots.

Despised love struck not with woe
That head of curly knots,
Nor stomach troubles laid him low,
Young Stephen Dowling Bots.

O no. Then list with tearful eye,
Whilst I his fate do tell.
His soul did from this cold world fly
By falling down a well.

NEW AND ON VIEW: MUDLARK NO. 19 (2002)

SMITH STREET: a melodrama in three acts
(or, Sunset Clause)
(or, Between Heaven and Hell)

by John Kinsella, Tracy Ryan and Steve Chinna


SMITH STREET was first performed by Theatre Studies students and directed
by Steve Chinna at the Dolphin Theatre, the University of Western
Australia, on 24 May, 2001.

from Steve Chinna's Programme Notes:

"SMITH STREET explores the lives and politics of local 'high' and 'low'
life who intermingle in a space between heaven and hell - where naturalism
moves to fantasy, prose to poetry, dialogue to song, and the distinctions
between law makers and law breakers are destabilised."

"When John Kinsella approached me late in 2000 regarding the production of
a play he was writing - based around events in Perth concerning Smith
Street, kerb-crawling clients, prostitutes, and political game-playing -
he expressed the wish that it be first performed by students at the
Dolphin Theatre at UWA in recognition of the long involvement in theatre
production and performance by staff and students at this university. The
play was written in collaboration with Tracy Ryan and its poetical nuances
display the verbal gymnastics and strong visuality of the dialogue. I was
given carte blanche to add material and direct it for performance without
authorial intervention. It was clearly recognised by both John and Tracy
that a script can only be a potential in terms of staging. I am grateful
to them for the opportunity to present this work in performance, and to
the efforts put into it by all concerned - especially the students of both
cast and crew who have worked on this project with such enthusiasm -
against study and work commitments that often made sustained rehearsal
impossible."

JOHN KINSELLA is the author of more than twenty books whose many prizes
and awards include The Grace Leven Poetry Prize, the John Bray Award for
Poetry from The Adelaide Festival, The Age Poetry Book of The Year Award,
The Western Australian Premier's Prize for Poetry (twice), a Young
Australian Creative Fellowship from the former PM of Australia, Paul
Keating, and senior Fellowships from the Literature Board of The Australia
Council. His POEMS 1980-1994 and volume of poetry THE HUNT (a Poetry Book
Society Recommendation) were published in May 1998 by Bloodaxe in the UK
and USA, THE UNDERTOW: NEW & SELECTED POEMS (Arc, U.K), VISITANTS
(Bloodaxe, 1999), WHEATLANDS (with Dorothy Hewett in 2000), and THE
HIERARCHY OF SHEEP (Bloodaxe/FACP, 2001). He is the editor of the
international literary journal SALT, a Consultant Editor to WESTERLY
(CSAL, University of Western Australia), Cambridge correspondent for
OVERLAND, (Melbourne, Australia), co-editor of the British literary
journal STAND, International Editor of the American journal THE KENYON
REVIEW, and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. A novel GENRE was
published in 1997 (Fremantle Arts Centre Press) and GRAPPLING EROS in late
1998 (FACP). He co-edited (with Joseph Parisi) a double issue of
Australian poetry for the American journal POETRY and more recently an
Australian issue of THE LITERARY REVIEW. He is Professor of English at
Kenyon College in the United States, a Fellow of Churchill College,
Cambridge University, and Adjunct Professor to Edith Cowan University,
Western Australia. His work has been or is being translated into many
languages, including French, German, Chinese, and Dutch.

TRACY RYAN was born and grew up in Perth, and has taught writing and
literature at various universities, most recently at Curtin University in
Western Australia. In the past few years she has also lived in Britain and
the USA. She has published a novel, VAMP, and three volumes of poetry. A
new volume of poetry, HOTHOUSE, and a new novel, JAZZ TANGO, will be
published with Fremantle Arts Centre Press in 2002. An experimental work,
bloc-notes, is due out in the USA with potes & poets.

STEVE CHINNA teaches theatre and performance studies in the Department of
English, University of Western Australia. He works with scripted plays,
and devises, writes, and directs new works, often in collaboration with
students. These new works have included: FROM DREAMS OF REASON, 1992; LOVE
AND ADDICTION: THE DIARY OF A CURE, 1994; THE SHE-WOLF'S BLOODY NECKLACE,
1995;  MISSIONARY POSITIONS, 1996; ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ALIEN (DARK
HEARTS), 1998; and Kinsella/Ryan/Chinna, SMITH STREET (BETWEEN HEAVEN AND
HELL), 2001.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Start the New Year with an Online Writing Course at trAce - courses begin 14 January. Sign up now for just 100 UK pounds. Topics include:


CREATIVE WRITING WORKSHOP Marjorie C Luesebrink
Online Creative Writing is designed to provide students with instruction in a workshop environment. Students will create and submit their work, read selected texts on the WWW, read and evaluate the work of other writers in the Workshop, discuss concepts and provide written feedback. This is a good starting point for those wanting to begin writing or to pick it up again. You may bring work in progress or start writing during the course. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr155.htm

BASIC WEBSITE DESIGN FOR WRITERS & ARTISTS Randy Adams
Through course material, discussions and practical assignments, Basic Website Design for Writers/Artists will guide students step by step through the maze of Hypertext Markup Language, webpage design, and going online. Although this course will guide students through the basics, it is also suitable for writers or artists who have become frustrated with building a website. Starting from the ground up, each segment will offer extended exercises for those who feel comfortable tinkering with the basic material. This course will stress creativity -- students will be encouraged to share ideas and to experiment. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr178.htm

TEXTUAL MACHINES Carolyn Guertin
Electronic texts are like machines, composed of interlocking words and images in time and space. This class will explore the schematics of web-based narratives. After reading a range of exemplary works, students will build some small narrative machines of their own: a map, a puzzle or a sculpture and a machine of their choice. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr158.htm

EXPERIMENTAL WRITING Alan Sondheim
A roller-coaster ride to the edges of literature and philosophy on the Web. Extend your writing into new and uncharted territories and see how far the internet can push your personal limits. There is no map for this course - each time it runs in a different direction dictated by the dynamic of the group itself. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr157.htm

WRITING CHILDREN'S FICTION Karen King
We will explore the various markets for children&#8217;s books and guidance will be given on how to aim at a specific market, get an agent and find a publisher. Special attention will be given to the skills needed, such as vocabulary, dialogue, creating characters children can identify with and writing for different age groups. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr167.htm

STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTE: NARRATIVE VOICE WORKSHOP Sharon Rundle
In this workshop you will begin to discover your own 'voice' as well as some techniques to narrate stories from your chosen points of view. You will become familiar with dialogue, internal monologue and stream of consciousness and have the opportunity to try out or extend these techniques in your own writing. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr180.htm

NOVEL WRITING Jean Chapman
This course is designed by a novelist to help students avoid basic errors in constructing a long manuscript. The aim is to give pointers progressing from original idea to finished manuscript. The course will also aim to make new writers aware of the business side of publishing today. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr143.htm

TRAVEL WRITING FOR FUN & PROFIT Caron James
A step-by-step guide for travel lovers who want to write about their experiences for magazines and newspapers. The course will teach how to research, construct and write travel articles and how to get them published. Learn about the different types of travel writing and how to make your story appealing and unique. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr181.htm

THE BASICS OF ARTICLE WRITING Dr. Mary Ann L. Diorio
Designed for beginners, this course will explore the basics of writing a publishable article. Topics covered will include finding viable ideas, turning ideas into excellent articles, preparing a professional manuscript, editing your manuscript, choosing an appropriate market, writing a great query letter, and re-selling your articles as reprints. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr184.htm

SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP Bonnie O'Neill
An introduction to the elements of the art of writing for film, TV and video. Students will develop their story ideas and learn the steps of screenwriting. Students can repeat the course to complete, revise and polish the final drafts of their screenplays, and develop a marketing plan. The course is tailored to each student's level. http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/school/courses/tr151.htm

Dear friends,

I am leading an introductory poetry workshop for undergraduates this spring.
Most of them won't be very knowledgable about poetry or how to make it, so I
am counting on nothing. Can any of you recommend a book for this endeavor?
Something in a reasonable price-point?

I am also open to strategic suggestions.

Happy new year to all,
Aaron

I previously sent an announcement about a new poetry annual I'm editing
called 88: A Journal of Contemporary American Poetry.  The unsolicited
submission window is March 1 through May 31 (see the guidelines below for
specifics).

Issue 1 was edited by Denise Stevens and has a lyric/lyric-narrative focus.
In Issue 2, I'd like to move toward a more avant-garde or experimental or
language-based or New York School sensibility (i.e., please don't have your
grandmother die in every poem).

We're also looking for short essays on poetry and poetics, and reviews.

I hope we'll hear from people on this list and let us know that in your
submission.

Poets Theater Jubilee

San Francisco’s poetic communities have, over the years, been the location
of many exhilarating experiments in theater. With minimal formal support,
poets & their supporters in the theater community have staged readings &
mounted productions of adventurous (& often hilarious) scripts. Beginning
in the 1950s, when Robert Duncan, Helen Adam, Jack Spicer & Michael
McClure first wed poetry to the stage, through the language experiments of
Carla Harryman, Bob Perelman & Kit Robinson, to the ambitious work today
of Leslie Scalapino, Kevin Killian, Camille Roy, Michael Amnasan and many
more, fine local experimental writers have worked in this genre.

Small Press Traffic, New Langton Arts, & the Jon Sims Center for the Arts
are joining together to present Jubilee, a Festival of Poets Theater. We
wish to extend our local tradition, while at the same time, honor it with
some critical attention. The festival will include four evenings of plays,
& a historical panel. We are building on the success of dozens of past
productions of poets theater in San Francisco, a long history with many
incandescent moments. We want to expand this nascent movement into a
full-stage celebration.

JUBILEE EVENTS AT SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC:

Friday, January 25, 2002 at 7:30

World premiere of "How Phenomena Appear to Unfold/The Hind," a new play by
Leslie Scalapino, directed by Zack. It's about our making illusions of
others. Also, the suffering of Afghanistan. "The Hind" will be buttressed
by a selection of short (10 minute plays) by poets mostly new to the
stage, including Tina Darragh, Stephen Beachy, Chris Vitiello, Dan
Farrell, Laura Moriarty & Nick Robinson, & Brent Cunningham. Evening
curated by Kevin Killian.

Friday, February 1, 2002 at 7:30

Three one-act plays, including the revival of an NY School masterpiece, &
newer plays by Carla Harryman & David Larsen; evening curated by Camille
Roy.

All ... I'm posting this to the Poetics list as I'd like to get a much broader
response to this questionnaire than I might by just going through my own
address book ... if you have time to fill out any part of it that pertains to
your online experiences I would be most grateful.

The Impact of Independent and Collegiate Publications on the
Field of Electronic Web Literature

When looking at the impact of information technologies on the study of
literature, one
cannot ignore how access to the World Wide Web and its use as a relatively
inexpensive
publication tool has altered the relationship between author and possible
audience,
decentralizing publication and dissemination of new literary works and creating
the
potential for any author to build what e-literature pioneer Mark Amerika has
called an
"audience share in the electrosphere".

It is time to explore the contribution made by online publishers and editors,
both
independent* and collegiate, to the rapidly evolving field of web-specific
literature.

To this end, I developed the following questionnaire last summer during an NEH
sponsored Summer Seminar led by N. Katherine Hayles to gather information from
authors, educators and publishers to better determine the role independent* and
collegiate online publications have played in the field of electronic
literature.  There are three sections to the questionnaire.  Depending upon the
role(s) you play within the field, you may choose to answer as: author,
educator, editor/publisher.

Please copy the questionnaire and type your answers below each question you
wish to answer, and mail the completed questionnaire to jtley@comcast.net by
January 31st, 2002.  Your answers will help inform a paper I’m preparing for
publication on this topic.

*  For the sake of this study, "independent" electronic magazines are those
conceived
for the Web which are not affiliated with a college or university, established
print
publisher [ie. Atlantic Online, Ploughshares, etc.] or cultural entity [ie. the
Walker
Museum.]


Questions for Authors

1.  When did you publish your first work on the web in an independent or
collegiate online magazine?
2.  How many times have you published work in independent or collegiate
online magazines?  Has the frequency increased over the past five years?
Please list up to five magazines and their urls where your work has been
published.
3.  Why do you send your work to an online magazine as opposed to
publishing it yourself on a personal web site or sending it to a print
magazine?
4.  Do you think that the editors of the magazines who have published your
work have helped you to promote your work?  [ie. have you received
invitations to submit work, give presentations, attend conferences based on
someone citing work they've read in an online publication?]
5.  When you do a search on your name online, what proportion (rough
percentage) of your work is published by independent or collegiate online
publications?


Questions for Educators

1.  How often have you turned to independent online publications or
collegiate online magazines in order to structure course reading material
for your students?
2.  Do you find that you turn to independent online publications
more/less/or about the same amount of times for course material as
opposed to online publications which have a history in the print literature
community?
3.  Assuming you have used online publications to structure course
material, please list up to five with urls.
4.  What do you think are the major contributions to the literary community
that independent or collegiate online magazines have provided?


Questions for Editor/Publishers

1.  How much traffic did your web site generate in the year 2001?  Please
try to estimate # of readers, not individual page hits.
2.  What percentage readership growth do you see each year?
3.  What percentage of your readership comes from .edu ISPs?
4.  What percentage of your readership comes from the US?  From Europe?
From Canada and Australia?  From Latin and South America?  From Africa?
From Asia?
5.  If your stats give you this information, how many separate countries
have provided visitors?  Please list some that have surprised you.
6.  How many authors/works did you publish in the year 2001?
7.  What proportion of the work you publish is hypertext or hypermedia?
8.  Do you publish theory, editorial or historical articles about literature
and
e-literature?
9.  What are the major technical challenges your publication faces in the
near future?  What problems do online publications face which are different
from those faced by their paper counterparts?
10.  How is your publication funded?

i love getting your stuff, though i must confess i don't read it all with
the same attention --it depends on my mood, my schedule, etc --but i
wouldn't do anything different, alan --your constant production is part of
the ambient noise of the list, as far as i'm concerned, and damn good
ambient noise it is, too.  i find your prolificness inspiring and your
example too.  don't change a thing.

        I say keep on keepin' on, Alan. Those who are interested will read,
and you can't worry about the others. I doubt many of us read each one with
equal attention, but I wouldn't want to miss any either, and digest mode
makes no sense. I get Poetics on digest anyway, so might get several pieces
in a group already--wouldn't want more at once. There's another effect to
having you out there writing every day, sort of like Ted Enslin or Cid
Corman, a prod to the conscience of the lazy.
        (Full disclosure: I don't know Sondheim, encountered his work on
this list,  then published a piece of his, "Jennifer in Phaedra," in my

The Author's Apology for Heroic Poetry and Heroic License



TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
HAROLD BLOOM, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF ARTS AND LETTERS, YALE UNIVERSITY
LORD CHAMBERLAIN OF HER MAJESTY'S CANON,
KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER, ETC.


My dear Bloom,


It comes within the compass of my power to express all the duty I own, and
to pay some duty to our methods of looking upon the world of Literature; so
far have your honorable favors outstripped all means to manifest my humble
affection that there is nothing left but writing and wondering. There is a
sleek serpent that breeds in many minds, feeding only upon forgetfulness and
bringing forth, into birth, all but ingratitude and ignorance. To show that
I have not been bitten by that monster, for wyrms prove monsters in this
age, which yet never any painter could counterfeit to express the ugliness,
nor any poet describe to decipher the height of their illness, I have
presumed to tender these Madrigals only as remembrances of my service and
witnesses of your Lordship's liberal hand, by which I have lived so long,
and from your honorable mind that so much have all liberal sciences. In this
I shall be most encouraged if your Lordship vouches the protection of my
choice of a modern epic brought about upon the occasion of such a loose, low
brow character set, for that both your greatness and your judgment in poetry
avant garde best may. For without flattery be it spoke, those that know your
Lordship know this, that using this science fiction as a recreation, as your
Lordship has over gone most of them that make it a practice. Right Honorable
Lord, I hope it shall not be distasteful to number you here amongst the
favorers of poetry avant garde, and its practitioners, no more than Kings
and Emperors that have been desirous to be in the roll of astronomers, that
being but a star fair, the other an angel's choir.
The worth of this poem is too well known to need commendation, so I thank
you in advance and understand your silent nod. As are the flights of heroic
poetry's fancy in a culture bereft of the heroic. The poet knew beforehand
the sort of achievement possible the hero required for the present state of
affairs, whether capable of writing it or not. Well aware what had been done
by previous writers and what is done by contemporaries. This century 21 has
its duty to reverberate within the nature and wit of the poet in that poet's
surrounding. All that is fit to print should a printer find.


morality1

The silliest way to defend the Western Canon
is to insist it incarnates all of the seven deadly
moral virtues that make up our supposed range
of normative values and democratic principles.

This is palpably untrue...

The West's greatest writers
are subversive of all values,
both ours and their own.

Scholars who urge us to find the source of our morality
and our politics in Plato, or in Isaiah, are out of touch
with the social reality in which we live.

If we read the Western Canon to form
our social, political, or personal moral values,
I firmly believe we will become monsters of selfishness and exploitation.

To read in the service of any ideology is not, in my judgment, to read at
all.



You feel strongly; trust to those feelings, it will take its shape and
proportions as a tree does from the vital principle that actuates it. I too
do not think that great poems can be cast in a morals mould. It sits the
same in our dear friend Mr. Coleridge, who contrasts organic form, shaping
and developing within, with mechanical regularity not necessarily arising
out of the properties of the material, "as when to a mass of wet clay we
give whatever shape we wish it to retain when hardened." On this principle
of organic form an infinite number of right forms exist: if a poem is shaped
and developed from within it will grow like as a creature, living, and the
living shape it takes must depend upon how the infection or idea grows and
expands in the poet's imagination.
At the top of the hierarchy of former poesies, the pre-fab king, the
literary beast tackled, the Heroic Epic is upheld by an immense body of
critical theory. Indeed, so important is the Heroic Epic in the Western
Canon we have for a millennia derived moral, aesthetic, and religious
actions demanding from the world blind desires, driven passions over inner
fears, while abandoning ourselves in the bad habits and illogical thinking
of self acting heroes. This world has gradually become marvelously
variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has acquired the color of
April snow -- but We have been the colorists, acting like the wise cracking
cop on the edge: it is the human intellect that has made appearances appear
and transported its erroneous basic conceptions into things.


Poetry is meant to effect continuity and transmission of heroic values

on the battlefield the solitary hero dies

I too feel quite alone these days in defending the hero
to a violent warrior culture who needs to be psychoanalyzed
and find a stately later age gentleman to hold

a large-hearted liberality,
or better yet social democracy
is needed to glorify the valor of man

The Society revolves around the strong, and it is the weak that need
protecting

The honored
heroic   code

The warrior select is the fundamental of the western canon

between his lord and the sword of an assassin,
the thane of Northumbria is an oft-related example of how

a gift of armor and horses and land is no mere literary convention

a formal battle strategy as organization
to garner a garter within the legends
of Immortality's song of feats ultimate
among excellence, among excess

the heroic ethos contains reality

on the battlefield the solitary hero dies


The poesy of the Reformation is a boil that festers when not curbed by good
taste, and when the flow stops the poem very properly stops with it. There
were, it has been said, exact patterns of different kinds of poetry laid up
in some haven to which the true scholar might arise in his contemplations
and show the way towards the true poem. The poet of century 18 sat down to
write not a poetry but rather a poem and that poem sat within a certain
identity, a form within the recognized form, a poetry which belonged to all
but kept rather to itself and did not play well with others. The reader too
knew what was fast approaching and feared to tread naught for what ever
faerie dance might a flute bring and expecting a goal responded to by rules
set forth by the poet's predecessors, who acting upon the good tidings of
Horace, or mere wit. What influence these ideal patterns had, what reverence
they evoked, is scarcely conceivable now within a time of no mythologies or
levitations; nothing to counter the uncontrolled controls and converge upon
untouchable prophets and their sons steeping in absolute truth.

I say tell you true, The time is fast approaching, and now is when the dead
poem shall hear the voice of the present: and they that hear shall live. He
that hears my word, and believeth in him the poets sent before, have an
everlasting literature. A literature passing from poem into poetry and
poetry towards a Poetry. As we find in John: For as the Father hath life in
himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. But if you
believe not this heroic epic, how shall we ever find belief in words?

Precipices and cataracts may be more dramatic per se than a field of toilets
but both are American standards full of flashing penetrative insight
revealing beauty as the union of the shapely with the vital. It is the
subjects chosen for works of art should be such as really are capable of
being expressed and conveyed within the limits of those arts. Art is the
power of placing a word where none existed before.


on the battlefield the solitary hero dies

The purpose of Anglo-Saxon epic, particularly the Germanic heroic poetry,
the authority pictured obligations, responsibilities,
to glean wisdom in the body politic and not spit in an eye
a useful lessons to garner moral sanctions governing behavior

an abstract reflection of Anglo-Saxon society

a sense of self reflection acting on itself
to out do the hero of the page to rule the Word
a selling back of sorts toward its medium
from which it was first purchased

the group glorifying the bravery of the few
This pragmatic view of heroic poetry is supported

discriminate the monsters to destroys is
to maintain commitment to community
heroism is maintaining civilization

venturing towards battles against evil
the constant vigilance is constant vengeance
is this not the way of Pax Americana

But precisely this: we seek out the hero, and let us not be ungrateful to
such resolute fellows who have played the role for our poets to transcribe
perspectives and valuations of their spirit, with apparent mischievousness
and futility. To see differently in this century, to want to see
differently, is no small discipline and preparation for a future
objectivity. Henceforth, my dear Professor Bloom, let us be on guard against
the dangerous old conceptual fiction that posited a pure, painless, timeless
knowing subject; let us guard against the snares of contradictory concepts
as pure reason, absolute spirituality, knowledge in itself; as these always
demand of an eye of absurdity and  nonsense.


the aesthetic2

its best defense is the experience of reading King Lear
King Lear does not derive from a crisis in philosophy,
nor can its power be explained away as a mystification
somehow promoted by the bourgeois institutions.

It is a mark of the degeneracy of literary study
that one is considered an eccentric for holding
that the literary is not dependent upon the philosophical,

and that the aesthetic is irreducible to ideology
or worse to mere metaphysics. Aesthetic criticism
returns us to the autonomy of imaginative literature

the sovereignty of the solitary soul, the reader not
as a person in society

but as the deep self,
our ultimate inwardness.


Thus most humbly submitting myself and my labors and whatever is or may be
in me to your Lordship's protection, I humbly end, wishing your Lordship as
continual an increasing of health and honor as there is a daily increase of
virtue to come to happiness.

spaces; and to explore performances as contexts of exchange and ways of
knowing.

     Additional Apparitions is co-edited by the British critic, editor
and poet David Kennedy and Keith Tuma and will provide a substantial
gathering of provocative perspectives on the elusive but crucial "liveness"
of poetry.

Contributions include:
Dell Olsen on Carla Harryman and Fiona Templeton

cris cheek on the changing relationship of print and performance

Peter Middleton on poetry readings and poetry as research in Allen Fisher
and Bruce Andrews

Steve Benson in conversation about past performances

Carla Harryman on the writing of "Performing Objects Stationed In
Platform on the Sub (Urban) World"

Ian Davidson on Paul Green, Caroline Bergvall and the performed
word

Peter Riley on mass lyric

Nathaniel Mackey on writerly poets and performance; and the
recording of Strick

Lee Ann Brown on performance anxiety

Frances Presley on collaborations in cyberspace

Caroline Bergvall on siting writing

     The first 100 copies of Additional Apparitions will include a specially
commissioned West House Books supplement by Geraldine Monk
entitled "Insubstantial Thoughts On The Transubstantiation Of The Text" -
unique insights by one of the UK's leading poets and performers into the
passage of a text as it travels from the intimacy of the private reading to
its various public vocalisations.

Rates are as follows:
     UK and other sterling customers
Additional Apparitions retails for £9.00 but if you order before January
31st it will only cost you the special discounted price of £7.00 post free

There is a book edited by Mark Strand and Eavan Boland that deals with form
from older poets to more contemporary poets called "The Making of a  Poem".
This can work as a reasonable introduction, I have used it for freshman
classes.

Hi --


    If Nims's Western Wind is still in print (probably isn't), it's my fave.
But I have usually wound up using...oh crumbs, the contemporary poet's, it's
in its 6th edition now.  McClatchy?  Lotta help, huh?   Bill Matthews was
planning to do one before his early death, and I lament its absence.

Dear friends,

I am leading an introductory poetry workshop for undergraduates this spring.
Most of them won't be very knowledgable about poetry or how to make it, so I
am counting on nothing. Can any of you recommend a book for this endeavor?
Something in a reasonable price-point?

I am also open to strategic suggestions.

Jennifer, I would more than love to give your survey
time and fill it out (as I suffer congenital ~Curse of
the Leisure Class~ and have all the time in the
world!) but I find the above initial assumption too
bothersome, that it would all be carried out under the
rubric of e-literature ~mercenary~ Mark Ameri a's
careerism being fueled this way (especially now, at a
time when his  epoynymously anti-U.S. sentiments ring
more "Rebel without a Cause" adolescent than ever).

And, since writing ~anything,~ check Yes, check No,
below that line's inaugural assumption would be an
implicit agreement with your Mark Ameri a promotion, I
can't really touch this thing, beyond letting my
Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition do the rest.









(Thanks for the invitation, though, and sorry to
decline so politically: it's not you, whom I like
very, very much.  It's just the company the survey
keeps, the pop-up window advertisement.)

Azure and I bought wedding rings today. I'm still reading Lacan's Feminine
Sexuality again, Bachelard's The Poetics of Space, Dirac's The Principles
of Quantum Mechanics. I found an anthology of Erasmus' works; I'm continu-
ing with Rabelais but the old Modern Library translation incorporates
notes from the French edition into the text which creates vortices unknown
in the original. O'Reilly sent me a copy of Dreamweaver in a Nutshell for
Dw4, which I highly recommend. I also received Albert Ayler's Spiritual
Unity and Bells on cds (I was with the original company) as well as Orn-
ette Coleman's Town Hall, 1962. The Ayler are my favorite jazz recordings
of all time. Traded some books in and found Essays on Sino-Korean Music-
ology: Early Sources for Korean Ritual Music by Robert Provine. I wonder
how much aak and gagaku are related. Also traded for Peter Hay, Broadway
Anecdotes; I know nothing about Broadway and am frightened of musicals.
Tomorrow we're seeing Kevin Magee and I'm bringing him copies of Archive
4.2, Et2, and a pamphlet on the Miccosukee language. I heard from the FIU
teacher's union today; they talked about publicizing the termination,
since my situation establishes a bad practice for faculty hiring. They
seemed also confused about my one-year tenure-track first-year contract,
but I haven't spoken to them directly; I heard in email. Yesterday Azure
and I trekked the 14 miles to the Shark Valley overlook and back. We're
going out with Gerald Jones on Sunday, but only half a mile or so; I want
to use a 35mm camera and telephoto for closeups of birds; reptiles and
fish I can approach, but not woodstorks which are fabulous and fabled. I
haven't started Solzhenitsyn's August 1914 which I bought a few days ago
(all my books except for the Dreamweaver are 2nd hand); I can't remember
whether I read it when it first came out. I'm still trying to think the
relationship between the mailart network (I have an old issue of Art
Papers devoted to it, and I've corresponded years ago with Ray Johnson and
James Lee Byars and Jon Held was my landlord in Dallas, his stamp-making
machinery next door) and the Internet and I'm also trying to think why
this sort of recuperation (which also involves the NE Thing company)
matters. I wonder if the discussion of the _lu_ in the Sino-Korean book
might help me think through issues of fundamental ontology - the deep
structure of sound in relation for that matter to raga/rasa - but then
even with this I return and worry about unemployment, returning to New
York instability once again. I take pride in my students at FIU, and I
think they in me, but then that doesn't guarantee work in a period of
football and budget cuts. The union representative wants publicity to
prevent further cases, not to further my own. I need a copy of Dream-
weaver4; I only have 3, and 4 sounds terrific; I could finally clean up my
ratty homepage which doesn't run some of the scripts on the newest brow-
sers. Yesterday I revised my Archive 4.1 cdrom - now Archive 4.2, cleaning
out some of the older graphics, adding new ones. Kevin will get the first
copy; he's been in Siberia. I'll have another sleepless night first,
worrying about health and jobs, and we're having a cold spell. The car
works after we replaced the battery. Something will get us there.

Dear Aaron,
Why not try Kenneth Koch's "The Art of Poetry"- it's
accessible, stimulating and has a mix of poetics in
that there are short & longer poems, parodies,
interviews, essays & so on - it's published by
University of Michigan Press in the Poets on Poetry
series, 1996.
Best wishes,

Alan and other Listers.  As you know like others I cant read it all but I
like it being on the list: as well as your CD Rom etc its like a project of
my own (although I am not so deeply into having things so leverly "worked
out " and the complex thoughts as you: he similarity is in that I have
finally begun a project (which was in part inspired by some essays by
Charles Bernstein) which maybe has a simililarity in that its online or its
in a book its (for me) sometimes what I'm thinking or remembering when I
write (which leads me to an explanation as to my "outbursts" at Keven
Killian and some of my "shoot from the hip" comments about S11 and so on but
I dont want to dodge being everything that is me...and as to Keven Killian I
actually found the site he shared very interesting and despite some (I admit
I'm a bit regretful here) rather harsh comments...it isnt my "whole" being
that is sending all the time...but I think to get back to what you are doing
it doesnt matter if we dont "follow" everything you do (time enough for
that) its highly original and very energetic stuff and it has a sense
ofopennes and going-on-ness which I think is useful and some of the posts
are extraordinary: the very vastness of your project is fascinating. use
journasl etc as well but this is a greta way...my attitude is to put things
on and at least someone gets to read them (may not be what people
like)...and its also also simply easier to get something "published"... not
that the old ways of publishing are not valid. Alltho of course the internet
isnt available to every one and hence your CD Ron and probably a book or
books and or journals but I thinnk its good to see it "fresh" and always
energising on the line: like others I cant read them all but I dont think
I've deleted one of your posts: I went on a deletion binge and there wer
hundreds of Alan Sondheims with red flags: if I'm "angry" with america that
grew from a sense of loathing because of  "all that useless love" I'm not
angry at the American people or people else where (my crit is to Governments
and the capitalist system etc etc etc)....I probably myself need to shift my
focus to New Zealand (Aotearoa)..but this interest in this list for me is no
"cultural cringe"..altho maybe there is a slight element its an Aotearoan
curse that Alan Curnow Baxter Smithyman struggled with...but I'm still
sticking with the cultural america...not military and poitcial america (of
course there are llinks there but its aol very complex and funadamentally
(at times) tragic)...but I think hope or one hope is in such as yourself
creating (rather than destroying) and I swerve toward creating for now...
 But I agree with most others: keep going Alan. I love seeing your posts and
the poems. Best for the New Year Alan and All, Richard.

Kenneth Koch has some books about teaching poetry & learning it.  One is an
anthology caklled sleeping on the wng.  It doesn't really tear concepts at
all bur more appreciation.  That was Koch's schtick when I took his class in
college.  (But Sleeping on the Wing was made for high school I think and the
lectures we had were a lot deeper than the book).  The book is mostly (not
surprisingly) New York School and Lorca and Mayakovsky etc etc.  I may be
wrong about Mayakovsky.  I know we read him in the course but I don't know
if he was in that book...

If you don't mind buying a big anthology (I think it's actually a good idea
because if your students don't re-sell it right away they might get hooked
on poetry and then they'll have a poetry book, there is "Poems for the
Millenium, edited in two huge volumes by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris.
You could make them get just one volume.  This is if you want to concentrate
on the foundations of modern/contemporary poetry.  For that, you could also
get the non-huge but still pretty big Norton Anthology of Postmodern Poetry.
Or to get less radical, the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry (I use this
all the time and people complained that it is too multicultural and it
doesn't have a great choice of contemporary poetry but it's pretty
authoritative up to the present.  If you want to specialize in contemporary
work, there is a small book called the An Anthology of New (American) Poets,
edited by Lisa Jarnot, Leonard Schwartz, and Chris Stroffolino ($21.95).

I first taught myself the basics from a really old book called "Sound and
Sense."  There are things in it that might seem objectionable, but they keep
you awake (eg there is a chapter called "Bad Poetry And Good" in which the
exercises cite two poems on the same subject with one being a fairly
well-know decent poem and the other is a deliberately constructed "bad"
poem, and the exercise is to say which is which and why; then the next
chapter is about "Good Poetry and Great" that does the same kind of thing)
But what I like about this book is that is teaches the basics about meter,
forms, literary devices, etc. which are basic building blocks even in
modern/contemporary poetry (just because we don't often write in a strict
meter does not mean we aren't influenced by meter!).  The book also has a
useful anthology at the end.

I distrust anthologies which cover the entire period of poetry since Homer
all the way to, say, Williams...  I think a book like a more modern verion
of Sound and Sense (I know it's been re-issued, and there are a bunch of
books like that; I can't remember now!) along with a few well chosen poets
along the history of literature to study in some depth. I would choose
Beowulf (an extract, showing the original, but studying a chosen version,
preferably one retaining some of the poetry; I like Rebsamen and haven't yet
read Heaney's, which was well-received, a single Canterbury Tale, Some
Shakespeare sonnets, something by Blake, something by Coleridge ("The Rime
of the Ancient Mariner" will do -- you either hate it or love it), something
by Browning (say, "My Last Duchess"-- make sure the class understands that
he probably killed her), A biggish something taken from the first version of
Whitman's Leaves of Grass, maybe something by Emily Dickinson, and then
you're home free into modern stuff....  I'm afraid that the list I just made
up is already too long....

I'm glad you can do it, too. I like to think a lot of us know how to use our
"abnormal" energies more effectively than most people realize. The media
seldom recognizes that we're more than the sum of our symptoms.

Does anyone, with better calculus aptitude than mine, know
how to explain the precise meaning of Zukofsky's famous
expression in "A"-12 where he says, "I'll tell you about my
poetics -- / ... / An integral:/ Lower limit speech/ Upper
limit music" -- at the ellipsis is a figure that looks
something like this:

               music
           ss
          s  s
          s
          s
          s
          s
       s  s
        ss     speech

I have a vague notion of the poetry existing within these
limits, sometimes approaching one and sometimes the other
(vernacular artless directness, abstract formalist opacity)
but never quite entering either state -- but I'd appreciate
hearing from anyone who can explain this in more detail, or
correct me if it turns out I have no idea what I'm talking
about. What, specifically, is an integral? The dictionary
tells me how they're calculated, but not what they're for.

Thanks,
Damian

As others on the list may have suggested, try Ron Padgett's book (Teachers
and Writers Collective) called something like _Handbook of Poetic Terms_.
It's an abecedary or glossary with little articles on things like meter, the
line, verse, concrete poetry, etc.  It also contains entries on a number of
poetic forms which I found useful in a course structured around the idea of
having the students attempt "experiments" (revising the ones they found most
useful for a final portfolio).  The articles also direct you to "example
texts" from Countee Cullen to John Ashbery.  Worth a look.

Best of luck,

Subject: textbook ideas needed


Dear friends,

I am leading an introductory poetry workshop for undergraduates this spring.
Most of them won't be very knowledgable about poetry or how to make it, so I
am counting on nothing. Can any of you recommend a book for this endeavor?
Something in a reasonable price-point?

I am also open to strategic suggestions.

Happy new year to all,
Aaron

New Media Violent Terror Course this Semester:


Please note attendance is mandatory and part of your grade. You will be
hung. You will survive scorpions. You will survive Survivor. You are also
required to have an anonymous email address - and to check your email at
least several times a week. Some of the class participation is online. You
are expected to spread at least one virus/week across the campus.

Assignments:

a. If you have not taken the course before - there are two projects - one
due at the end of the course, and one at the midway point. If you don't
live past the midway point you get an A.

Midway: A piece in any non-traditional medium (performance, sound, video,
cannon, computer, tank, html) dealing with either: Issues of self; or:
Light; or: Shark Valley in the Everglades; or: why WE are better than THEY
are; or KILL FACTOR: SPECIAL EDITION.

Final: A work or works in any non-traditional medium dealing with a sub-
ject of your choice involving firearms and torture (water not included);
you should have decided this by the mid-February, and you should be
prepared to report on your progress during the class periods, to the
remaining students.

b. If you have taken the course before - you may continue working on your
projects, as determined previously. If you are able to continue, your
grade is a B maximum.

This course will consist of several components:

1. Going through the Michael Rush book in the beginning; looking at other
work; looking at work on the Internet and Net.Art. Assignment: Why is
Net.Art dead? If you think it is alive, kill it off. If you cannot kill it
off, you may use firearms and torture as above. This is necessary for a
passing grade. Note that Net.Art is tricky: Turning off your machine does
NOT kill the webpage for everyone else!

2. An overview of the Internet and the work presented on and through it;
this involves the history, demographics, and culture of the Net, presented
in brief. Assignment: Begin a commercial Website which deadends at least
15 trillion email addresses. Create a form that replies with at least 15
megabytes of broken higher ascii to every "please unsubscribe" email
address.

3. Learning the components of the digital video studio - these include:
Premier, Imovie, Movieshaker, Moviemaker, and FinalCut Pro. You do not
have to know these in depth, but if you are working in video, you should
try and learn at least one of these well. Assignment: Naked sex involving
at least one consenting animal to be presented live in class and on the
Net. No children, but if you lose a limb you automatically get an A. If
the tape makes money, you get 25% of the profits plus hospitalization.

4. Learning about the other components available: audio including Audio-
mulch and Soundforge; imaging including Gimp and Photoshop; 3d modeling
with Blender and Mathematica; and anything else that might be of use to
you in your projects. Doom and Quake are permitted providing a parallel
course setup is created with live ammunition and human targets. Any
killing or injuring of animals strictly prohibited. Mathematica may be
used in the design, development, and production of small-scale nuclear
weapons; we can use the populated parts of South Florida for trial runs.

You are not expected to be an expert in any of these programs; you are
expected to be self-motivated if you want to explore or use any of them in
depth. Please note that the course is not program-based, but is concerned
instead with the entire new media area. Assignment: Create a work based
entirely on Allah/Christ/Buddha/Confucius/God/Nothing/ or the (non) tran-
scendence of your choice. The work must prove beyond the shadow of a doubt
that this transcendence is really _it._ A second and shorter work should
define _it._ A third work should portray the resulting carnage. If the
third work cannot be carried out because of sudden death syndrome, you
receive an A. If you cannot get a grade, you receive an A.

5. Learning how to use microphones, anthrax, digital still cameras, plas-
tique, crowbars, small-scale nuclear weapons, Internet spam and video
cameras. We will cover camera/sound/planting/fertilizing (see sex above)/
harvesting/coverup techniques. Learning how to hide violations of civil
rights; learning how to hide suspected terrorists; learning how to hide
anyone; and learning how to eliminate civil rights/terrorists/anyone for
extra credit.

6. Learning how and where to distribute new media work and what to do if
your audience no longer exists. What to do if you hate your audience. What
to do if your audience hates you. Last gasp: What to do if your audience
loves Net.art.

Please do not expect this course to be highly-structured! It isn't - it
depends on you, and your ability to survive or court death (for our
purposes the two are equivalent). The length of the course is inversely
proportional to its success; it will be best if we no longer make it
through the year (or if hospitalization is a MUST).

Good luck.

Alan Sondheim

[INTRO:] I'm always frustrated with the space limitations imposed on _The
Gig_'s review section because of its printed format (postal costs dictate
the magazine be only 64pp, of which usually 6-12pp are reviews), & there
seem to me a lot of good books from the past year or so which I keep making
notes to myself about reviewing in the mag's pages but never finding time or
space to do so.  So: here's a list of books, with contact details for
publishers.  I'd originally just intended to make a bibliographical list,
but instead ended up making some offhand comments & trying to quote a poem
or extract to give a sense of what a book's like.  (A particular gripe of
mine about publishers: their email & print flyers usually include copious
blurbs but NO POEMS, or only 3-4 lines.)

I'll post a 2nd instalment shortly; this is already long enough for a single
email posting, I think!  I'll also make a short list of those books reviewed
in issues 8-10 of _The Gig_ that are especially notable too.

The books below should be obtainable in the UK via Peter Riley
(priley@dircon.co.uk) & in the US & Canada via SPD (www.spdbooks.org).  Alan
Halsey (see below under his name for email address) I know carries Coach
House & so would be another source for the McCaffery in the UK.  The Salt
titles are carried by Amazon.

said his major poetic influence was Beckett's poetry, curiously enough:

                    across the diesel
                    breath of meaningless journeys.
Sign me
a bite or grip
of quiescence
                    about the smeared seed
                    & lemming fumes

Oh boy....the idea's simple: this contains every word Goldsmith spoke for a
week in 1996, surreptitiously taperecorded & then meticulously transcribed.
I've only read the first 100pp so far & find it extraordinary, not least for
the extreme discomfort & fascination the text produces because of the amount
it reveals about Goldsmith, his friends, personal & professional life.  (I
gather some of the friends are now ex-friends: what I gather was the
original epigraph to the book, "IF EVERY WORD SPOKEN IN NEW YORK CITY DAILY
WERE SOMEHOW TO MATERIALIZE AS A SNOWFLAKE, EACH DAY THERE WOULD BE A
BLIZZARD," has been shifted to the back: in the front is instead a couplet
from Catullus: "Someone I flattered in a book pretends / he owes me nothing.
Oh the trash I have for friends!")  If "reveals" is the right word, as part
of the interest is in how much talk & conversation & gossip actually
_conceal_. -- Here's the 1st page of a selection that appeared in _The Gig_
8:

Well, Janet's sitting next to Douglas.  Can you see her?  I've heard I've
heard rumors about Douglas.  Sexual ones.  No no no no, that's not my
concern either I'm just gossiping.  That that he's got some problems in that
department.  We were just talking about...why are we dysfunctional?
Douglas's sexual problems.  That's what everyone talks about.  Douglas I've
heard I've heard more stories about him in that in that regard.  So, hey,
there's nothing to worry about.  We might have heard it from Andrea Scott
but, no.  Who did we hear that from Cheryl?  That Douglas couldn't get it
up?  No this was oh I think like Mary Jo must have told us that.  Wouldn't
be a bad idea. Wouldn't be a bad idea.  Well, we might be the ones to vomit.
Mean lookin'.  I've seen that.  Yes, I've seen that.  We've seen this.  Yes,
we've seen this.  Yes it grows and it's never quite as big as the head.
Right right right right.  This is a good movie.  So Grandpa's really got got
chic.  There's a strange confluence of worlds here tonight.  Poland is
represented.  The artists staying in Poland.  Yeah, there's a lot of those
people here.  And then there's a lot of bit old bitter conceptualists.  I
was just telling Stefano.  Jim Lewis.  Argh.  What does that mean?  God help
you?  Yeah the whole world he thinks everybody is hitting on him that guy.
Don't be flattered.  Hello Graham.  I can.  No we shouldn't flatter him.  We
shouldn't inflate his already over inflated ego, Cheryl.  Grazie grazie.
Grazie grazie.  You can bring me a drink.  I'm dying thank you.  Thank you
I'm really thirsty.  Oh my, so did you have dinner here?  How ya doin'
Graham? I heard you guys had had a, uh, a little meeting of the minds about
the current show at your gallery.  How's the show though.  We're not
thrilled with the show.  What?  What with Richard's show?  Oh, we're talking
about Richard's show.  I couldn't stand Dominique's show.  This guy looks
like he walked out of 1978 this guy in the leather coat.  Doesn't he?  I
haven't seen that look in fifteen years.  Yeah, the guy in the red shirt?
Kind of like New Wave a little bit sort of Punk.  Yeah I haven't seen it in
a really long time.  Yeah.  So Graham, what's happening with you musically?

The visual appearance of this is close to Raworth's _Logbook_: prose texts
set inside elaborate b&w visuals (collaged from photos: the page with the
Pope, someone in a Halloween mask & Aaron Williamson juxtaposed is esp.
memorable).  The texts are printed in narrow newspaper columns & there's
much play with linebreaks & pagebreaks (every single page ends in
midsentence & by the time you turn the page it has utterly switched
direction). Here's the first page, unfortunately not with a justified right
margin, but you get the idea.

A figure from the 1960s avantgarde (both film & poetry) I'd heard about
every so often but without coming across his work.  This book comes with a
very interesting interview with P.H.'s half-sister Marisabina Russo-Stark,
which outlines the sad outlines of Heliczer's life--born in Rome; his father
killed by the Germans; the remaining family transplanted to the States, a
new stepfather deserting the family; Heliczer's erratic career due to
increasing mental instability; restless movement between the US & Europe; a
death from a crash on a moped.  Here's a short poem from "& i dreamt i shot
arrows in my amazon bra":

THE BEAUTIFUL AMBUSH

expectancy strings time
ah the cloud patches more perfect black ah les taures
        of the sky
wind moves through steers hide
the sounds of death and the stars are the
same whirring click like the lute stop
like a quiver of feathers thrown in to the air
like the blades of a wind wheel falling circularly in air
we lie down in a beautiful ambush
and read the poem we know almost by heart of the stars a
        pillow of quills


Peter Larkin, _Terrain Seed Scarcity: Poems from a Decade_.  Applecross,

US/£9.95/$20.95 Cdn/$24.95 Aus.  199pp.  (www.saltpublishing.com)

Larkin has developed a distinctive style of prose-poetry over the past
decade: brief but very dense paragraphs separated by bands of white space;
occasionally they break into verse that reads almost like cryptic,
multidirectional marginalia notes (Susan Howe is an author Larkin especially
admires).  It's poetry that both has the density of speculative
philosophical prose & the linguistic playfulness & density of Zukofsky; it's
not at all easy going but I've found myself increasingly respectful of &
engaged by this book (especially its later sections) as I have returned to
it.  The opening section, extracts from _Scarce Norm Scarcer Mean_, is
perhaps a mistake, as it's extremely opaque (full of coinages) & the partial
presentation makes it hard to judge what the book's trying to do; but
thereafter there are 8 full-length sequences, & the book closes on a high
note, the wonderful "Spirit of the Trees", short syllabic poems formed out
of the vocabulary of poems included in a 1947 anthology of that title (the
inspiration is a sequence by Peter Riley but the effect is rather more akin
to _80 Flowers_). -- Here's an extract from "Landscape with Figures Afield",
a series of brief statements in the manner of Thomas A Clark:

Here, in a remote, preparatory and instrumental working, imposition is
dedicated to the woods.


Knots and compartments, whose speculations are matched to a helper of root:
lest this green world is not sufficient to look abroad into the fields.


Cascades amend, but fail to tend, a broken world: you certainly incline the
leaning of a wall to naturalism.


Apparent spoil, but no waste of the irreparable reaches.


The duty of mutual strife with ground: where a break in the branch has
twisted onto a root.


An unsolitary world does but transliterate other worlds.


Not to concede a probable nature, so as not to exceed a parlous one.


To picture the fields as mere variety leads our expectations into the city,
to a theatre of experience.


A variety to chance the mind's own multiplicity, round a narrow compass to
purge the rectitude of finitude's entirety.


Nature's _incurious_ accuracy: that some casual truths call for a measure of
addiction is not injurious.

464pp.  (www.chbooks.com)

What can one say about this: an absolutely enormous, & beautifully printed,
selection from McCaffery's last 30 years' worth of writing.  The selection
is I think indebted to Jackson Mac Low's _Representative Works_--the
emphasis is on providing examples of work from a wide range of texts from
throughout the career.  (Volume One is only drawn from poetry published in
book form; the forthcoming vol. 2 will have uncollected work.) -- I'll pick
two examples.  Here's a short text from _In England Now That Spring_ (1978),
a series of poems written during a trip in the UK in May 1978 making use of
Wordsworth's collected poetry (the original book also included poems by
bpNichol & some Nichol-McCaffery collaborations; the selection in _Seven
Pages Missing_ is confined to poems that are exclusively McCaffery's).

Helen Macdonald, _Shaler's Fish_.  Buckfastleigh: etruscan books, 2001.
1-901538-33-8 (paperback); 1-901538-34-6 (cased).  62pp.  (probably best
obtained via Peter Riley or SPD)

Macdonald by virtue of her birthdate (1970) found herself occupying the
formidable position of the last author in Keith Tuma's recent Oxford
anthology, a book that starts with Hardy & Hopkins.  This book is her first
full-length collection (it collects work that appeared in the earlier
_etruscan reader I_, but most of it is uncollected work).  Difficult,
rewarding work: the best short introduction to it is Keith's introductory
piece in the OUP book (& also search out Drew Milne's piece on lyric
humanism in _The Paper_ 2, which has an extended discussion of this book).
An authorial note in _foil_ is pertinent to Macdonald's combination of high
lyricism & often very demanding scientific material (from ornithology,
astronomy, atmospheric science, &c): "poems as maps, orienting the reader in
a field populated by different versions of the self and its relation to the
natural world."  Here's a short one I like, not perhaps a "typical" poem but
so what:

SMALL HOURS

for premises
and they say the best is, yet
                                    to get near it
requires such fabric of years there is a
stroke through it
& I can stand on the pantomime wall

One of the best sets of readings at CCCP in 2000 was probably the most
sparsely attended, I guess because it occupied the conference's deadspot
(early Sunday afternoon).  I was glad I caught it thought: a terrific
performance by the elusive Khaled Hakim, & an impressive one by the Polish
writer Tadeusz Pióro.  This book is basically a mini-_Selected Poems_; the
translations are the author's own (he's fluently bilingual & they read as if
written in English).  Here's one of the shorter ones:

like a familiar sea, though sirens don't help
when you want to lose count.  Let's meet
half way there: when I give you a sign
that there's no way out, answer just as mysteriously.

But even a firehouse goes awry sometimes
and at dawn the fog opens on a cunning trompe l'oeil:
a clear bay through a window,
sun's glitter, islands, sailboats
or some other, harmless, kitsch.
In a little bottle, the Flying Dutchman
cocks an ear and starts to count: luxuries, years
finally heartbeats and only the last thread of language
some beautiful, difficult sentence
holds us to the edge of the world.

This collects work from three chapbooks, _Fraction Anthems_, _Magazine
Poems_ & _Hotel Faust_.  This reminds me of the D.T. Lusk book for its sheer
attitude & wit; a really fine, frightening & funny book.  Here's the 1st
"Fraction Anthem":

a red knot.  We live in there, we play seek.
We live in there, we ratchet.

A friend of mine once called _Sarn Helen_, the climactic sequence of this
book, "unbearable": this was intended as praise.  Actually, I find this
remarkably compelling reading, for all its formidable density & dendritic
chains of association & reference.  (Wilkinson once compared his writing his
poems to an alchemist growing a homunculus.)  There is a useful authorial
note on the back (sic!--not exactly common practice among Cambridge-based
authors...), which comments in part: "One notable system of echoes and
transformaitons occurs around racial and cultural constructions, from the
movements of slavery and colonial migration marked in 'Chalone' and 'Colour
Swatch' at the start of the book, to the meditation on refugee displacement,
nationalism and the effect of new technologies on the apprehension of time
and place, which comprises the long poem 'Sarn Helen' at the end of the
book."  Here's the opener, from _Chalone_ (revised from its original Prest
Roots text), a sequence preoccupied with the colonial history of Jamaica:

OPERATIONS

To assemble the lily.  Gloss half-smeared
slips like a thumbprint broken through

sweet glaze; the visible hymen flaps;
a sky funereal peels from a sloping pond

hot sun beats or mains rupture plenishes.
The confectioner's system purrs easily:

summer stripes & smash, do to construct
flaked out, the numbed inquisitor of

feeling propped their water plate.  JCBs
shall batter, cars shall rend & groove

natural piety's cover, circulate in
fine fettle.  Sugar gushes plentifully.

This kidney island, poor Ind, which half-
slipped on sweets unwrapped, powered

with cane trash, stayed discovery, waits
insulin now turns its sweet to plenty

turn to the clear inlet pain, filled
with Arawak ghosts people a clear glaze,

neither slave nor indentured, dead
processors of sweets wired its virginity.

Petals rattle & smart, rewire together
proof for the technician's fingering

green stairwells, green detention doors
slamming into a kelson swinging low

one after another, endless decompression,
& never a breach to break out through.

two different books/kinds of books come to mine (i teach both intro and
adv. CW courses)
_The Portable Writers Workshop_ from Salmon Press in Ireland.  I have
found this great to use w/ intro courses; it's "workshoppy" and
"inspirational" but it does touch on technique and labor.  it is dedicated
half and half to poetry and fiction.
_The Handbook of Poetic Terms_ from Teachers and Writers Collabrtive.  A
true  handbook--entries for "sonnet," "line," "pantoum," "rhythm," etc.  I
use this in my adv., genre-specific courses because I want the students to
learn that poetry is a formal concern, not merely journal-writing cut off
in the middle of the page..!

good luck--

Hi List.  I'm presently working on an opera with the Lithuanian composer
Arturas Bumsteinas, and we need background voices.  You can help by sending
your performance of a brief score on tape or via voice file to Mr.
Bumsteinas.  To get background information and a copy of the score please
contact bumsteinas@yahoo.com   We're both poor, so we can only pay in good
Karma, a copy of the final CD and your name in the credits.  Please join us
in this internet project.  Your pal, Jesse

filling Station magazine
in association with the Calgary Writers House and Coach House Books
is proud to present a free reading by:

Christian Bok
reading from his new book
EUNOIA (Coach House, 2001)

January 17th, 2002.
Art Gallery of Calgary
117 8 Avenue SW
Calgary, AB Canada

doors 7:30, reading 8:00

Christian Bok is the author of Crystallography (Coach House, 1994), a
pataphysical encyclopedia nominated for the Gerald Lampert Award for best
poetic debut. Bok has created artifical langauges for  two television shows:
Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict and  Peter Benchley's Amazon. Bok
has also earned many accolades for his  virtuoso performances of sound
poetry (particularly the Ursonate by Kurt Schwitters). His conceptual
artworks (which include books built  out of Rubik cubes and Lego blocks)
have appeared at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New Yrk City as part of the
exhibit Poetry Plastique. He lives in Toronto, and his home page is at:

About EUNOIA:
 http://www.chbooks.com/online/eunoia/index.html
Over five years in the making, poet, 'pataphysican, performer and artist
Christian Bök's much-anticipated second book Eunoia is about to change your
perception of your own language forever. The word 'eunoia', which literally
means 'beautiful thinking', is
the shortest word in English that contains all five vowels. Directly
inspired by the Oulipo (l'Ouvroir du Littérature Potentielle), a
French writers' group interested in experimenting with different forms of
literary constraint, Eunoia is a five-chapter book in which each chapter is
a univocal lipogram (the first chapter has A as its only vowel, the second
chapter only E, etc.). Each vowel takes 0n a distinct personality - the I is
egotistical and romantic, the O jocular and obscene, the E elegaic and epic
(Bök actually retells the entire Iliad in Chapter E; you have to read it to
believe it). Stunning in its implications and masterful in its execution,
Eunoia is
poised to be one of the most unusual and important books of the year.

"It's beautiful, it's funny and it's moving ... Eunoia shows us our own
langauge both confined and released by the same mechanism. It is one of the
most exciting collections of poetry to appear in Canada in a long time."
   -- Michael Redhill, The Globe & Mail

"An exemplary monument for 21st-century poetry."
  -- Charles Bernstein

Everything I've ever seen is snow

It may not look like much,
you may not call it war,

but our practical gods
have laid it out in the snow
in its untranslatable self;
have shown how it shifts
how it skiis on clouds or ground,
how it is equally mine
and me

Sometimes I feel heat
and sometimes cold.
Both serve me equally.
But as a practical matter,
thinking it over,
considering everything,
give me snow.
And a lot of dark.
A mate if you can find one.

with the bone in for dinner.  She asked, David, have you ever been
to the sea, and yes, he had curdled brine for breakfast.   He longed
to go weeding again in the she-rocks.  She drowned thoughtlessly.
He forgave her, there was Alicia, her dim sister, the roto tiller of
his bowels.  Think, if she had not been also dead, oh, how
glorious.  But this was 1857, and anything was still possible.

Hello Damian,

We calculate integrals to identify the area under a curve.  The area
between the graph of a function and, say, the x-axis, is a geometric
representation of the aggregate value of that function over an interval.
The "s" like sign that Zukofsky uses in this poem is a concrete
exhibition of the mathematical symbol for integral.  This, called the
definite (or Riemann) integral, has a lower and upper limit.  When
expressed this way the area under a curve is calculated over the range
of the two limits.  "Music" and "speech" are the two limits that LZ
would be calculating the area from.  In essence, he is saying that his
poetics is a multi-dimensional space between speech and music.

I'm not sure if I had previously said this before, but
I found Mary Oliver's two books (Poetry Handbook and
Rules for the Dance) to be fairly useful, through
quite conservative in their approach. They both have
some pretty tree-hugging, floppy-eared, cute bunny
moments though.

Also, if you want to be alternative in your approach,
I have found Barbara Guest's Rocks on a Platter, Joan
Retallack's Afterrimages and How to Do Things with
Words and Yoko Ono's Grapefruit all challenging and
dynamic "how-to" books that address the creative
process and prosody from the inside out. Well, really
any text-piece by Ono or Retallack can serve.

I'd better be able to since that passage was what inspired me to
become the now world-famous mathematical poet that I am, but
I may well get it wrong:  I think he's saying that his poetics equals the
sum
of all the infinitesimal values from speech (the smallest value)
up to music (the highest value).  It's really not a complete
mathematical expression (I don't think) but it's supposed
to suggest integrating everything between the simplest speech up to
music in one's poetics.  With an emphasis on the tiniest of details.
Since the integration sign (the s-shaped thing) is often used to find
sizes of areas, it suggests expanses.  Since the integral sign also
is used to deal with values that in a sense are incalculable, it
also speaks of Mystery.  For me, too, the thing is a wonderful
copntrast, as extreme rationality (math) versus the usually extreme
intuitiveness of poetics/poetry.

Hope this helps.

                                                                    --Bob G.

Trane. I'm very much in agreement with this line of argument. I see that the
US and Britain etal are in fact the terrorists: even if, as is quite
possible the attack was not organised by certain extreme right wing groups.
What has since occurred is the usual in human history. The further
destruction of a nation already had its own quite stable government with
their own religion, philosophy etc We in the West are arrogant to impose our
"universal values" with the incredible savagery and arrrogance as the
British Empire did, the US are now doing as they have been doing since World
War Two when they held off until Britain was just about destroyed (they
refused to even repair the rolls royce engines out of the the Spitfire's,
Beaverbrook had to organise that on his own initiative!!)and only entered
the war  in terror that "communism" or anyway the Russians would take their
Europe. THEIR Europe. The US arrogant bastards bomb everything and everyone
and wonder why terrorist attacks continue: THEY ARE THE TERRORISTS. The
young man who crashed his plane recently was a hero: so is bin Laden and the
Al Qaeda. He needed to carry a massive bomb. The Americans are hated by
billions of people now. Its because its a corrupt nation paranoid and racist
and the military industrial political complex  run for capitalism is
basically a terror generator.  September 11 was nothing compared to what is
in store: it was peanuts. Believe me. Trust me. Richard.

In fact: what are we? Its probably one of the questions Alan is asking...he
has enormous energy...an indicator of the curse and greatness of the US and
all other "great powers" that have long since crumbled into the dust of time
etc cf Shelley of "Ozymandias"..... and maybe its also a kind of testeronic
force (tetesteronic?) may war etc has a sexual origion: the pursuit of
power. Think of the word "Corporate" which comes ffrom the body : corpus.
Politics charges the language: we "read too much into language" we are (are
we?) constituted by language - well it seems that way sometimes - human
consciouness. The most precious thing: life. Alan is alive:we are all alive.
We must, cant stop, creating, thinking, struggling, loving, hating, moving,
making. Women and men: people of all kinds who inhabit this earth. Why are
these words? Do we join each to each? Does it, anything, matter? We are
strange, beating things. Richard.

Good suggestion.  I already suggested Koch's "Making
Your Own Days" but "The Art of Poetry" is a pretty
interesting mix.  I hadn't thought of using it as a
textbook before, however.   Well you're at it, have a
look at his book of poems "The Art of Love" which
quite literally changed my life.

Damion. Integrate basically means to summate. In telecommunications integral
calculus can be used to summate a wave or say a signal (a speech on a
telephone in electrical form say) into a single wave shape: or in a
different way it can be used to analyse a signal eg a square wave is
theoretically made up of an infinite number of sine waves (think of of a
wavy line) and the maths for that was invented by Fourier (French
mathematicain inthe 19th century I think): hence Fourier analysis. I have
done some but I found it difficult but it's really only a process of
following a procedure...but I eventually foundered in Maths on a subject
called Linear Algebra which is very abstruse and for most people, quite
useless: but it is magical that there is literally a "chip" called a "Fast
Fourier Transformer" which the telecommunications systems use for immediate
line tests etc (probably to indicate frequency ranges attenuation etc) ..
there are also electronic integrators (they've been around probably in the
30s even with valve technology) which nowdays use Operational Amplifiers:
they are basically analogue computers...(as eg weight scales using springs
etc are)
  Zukovsky I think was also playing with the scroll shape on a violin and
also the musical signs which look a bit like the integral sign. A
mathematician could explain this better but the integral of something is the
summation of all its parts while the differentiation tells what's happening
at a single point or point in time of those parts (the rate of change of
something: the process indeed) so normally the integral sign will have at
point (say) 10 at the top and point 2 (say) at the bottom and between those
two points ( a "distance" of  8) what is going on in the wave (or whatever
process and her Zukovsky is "integrating" a part of human experience or
culture or consciousness) then music is at the "abstract top" and human
speech is at the "bottom" and all the things in between get intermixed and
integrated together and struggle against and for each other and it all boils
between music and madness and silence and noise and purpose and
purposelessness and horror and joy and Bach and Spinoza and communism and
and capitalism and me and you and he  and she and they and "good" and "evil"
and love and family and light, and sometimes here is an apparent coneherence
if only we knew but then if we knew we might give up. Probably you are none
the wiser but join the club if you find maths usually very baffling: but
sometimes maths can be quite magical.  Tired words from a tired old brain.

Story


The older man turns to the woman and says, "I don't know why you're making
such a fuss over this. I did speak to your son, and I thought there was an
understanding. He seemed to agree that there was an understanding between
us."

The older woman turns to the man and says, "I don't know where this is
coming from. We spoke about it a long time ago, all three of us. I have
eyes which are looking in your direction. I can see you clearly from my
perspective but I cannot see behind me."

The man says, "I can hear you even when I'm not looking at you. I will
take the memory of this conversation out of the room with me."

 He waves his hands around the room.

 He says, "I will be seeing other things when I walk and will take care
 not to fall anywhere."

 She walks towards him and turns.

  She says, "When you leave my vision will continue and I will hear as
  well. I will be hearing other things and seeing the same things but I
  will not be seeing you. Tomorrow I will remember this conversation and I
  may well remember it for a long while. I will be walking in other places
  and my steps will not be as these steps."

  He says, "When I think of other things I do not see them or hear them,
  but I continue to see and hear you when I am looking in your direction.
  When I am looking in another direction, I am seeing other things. I
  continue to hear you. When I think of other things I imagine them but I
  know where my feet are and I am keeping my balance at all times."

  She says, "It is a shame my son will be in the theater so soon. He will
  have to memorize what others have said, and will have to see in some way
  what others are telling him to see. Also he will have to hear."

  He says, "He will have to hear what he already knows. He will remember
  what he sees and hears. He will leave the room and will see other things
  and hear other things. He will think of more and more things. He will
  think of a great many things."

  She says, "He will be thinking of far more things than I am thinking of.
  When I leave you I will be thinking of other and different things, and I
  will be keeping my balance at all times. I will be seeing where I am
  looking, and I will be looking where I am seeing. I will be hearing in
  every direction, what is near to me."

  He says, "I will also be looking where I am seeing and I will be hearing
  other things, and we will not be hearing your son or seeing your son."

  She says, "We are not hearing or seeing my son. My son is not here. My
  son is keeping his balance at all times and he is seeing where he is
  looking."

  He says, "Yes, we are not touching him, and we are not touching each
  other. I am not feeling the outside of your skin. I am looking where I
  am seeing."

  She says, "I am feeling my skin from the inside and the outside. I am
  looking at my skin. I am seeing my hand touching my face. I will carry
  this touching with me. I can touch in every direction, what is near to
  me."

  She walks towards the door and leaves.

  He walks towards the door and leaves.

year history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny
Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy and
Nicole Brossard among many other experimental and hybrid women writers.
Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote work that is
experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content.  Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky if you would like to
receive a catalog or hear more about our salons.

There will be a short open reading before the featured readers.

Subject:      Brecht/Weill performance by Ute Lemper
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  7bit

Those of you interested in Brecht and Weill, would do well not to miss a
chance to see Ute Lemper perform "The Seven Deadly Sins" or to look for the
recording.

This is from a music review by Michael Anthony, Minneapolis Star Tribune,
January 7, of the concert I saw on Saturday:

       "Given her close identification with the music of Kurt Weill, it was
natural that the German actress-singer Ute Lemper would eventually tackle
Weill's 1933 opera/ballet 'The Seven Deadly Sins.'  Lemper has not only
recorded the work but in recent years has performed it with orchestras around
the country, and she did so with admirable success this past weekend in
concerts with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.

       "An odd but compelling work that was Weill's final collaboration with
Bertolt Brecht, 'Seven Deadly Sins' tells of Anna, who leaves her family home
in Louisiana to seek her fortune in the cities.  Anna is represented by two
people or, to take it more literally, there are two sisters Anna, a dancer
and a chanteuse.  Each step on their journey represents one of those sins
that Brecht, in fact, makes fun of, and every so often the focus shifts to a
male quartet [Hudson Shad] representing the family.  Weill made it one of his
richest scores: a clever fusion of popular and classical styles with an
almost symphonic coherence, and yet full of parody.

       "To perform the piece in concert -- without dancing or sets -- is a
special challenge for the singer.  Lemper, an accomplished actress, made it
work through a combination of deft body language, which allowed her to
distinugish the two sisters, and careful attention to the text, which was
delivered in German, with an English translation projected on a screen above
the stage.  She also knows how to use a microphone.  Rather than shying away
from the bitterness of Brecht's words, Lemper underscored the tone of anger
and irony, building the seventh section ("Envy") to a fierce climax.

       "After Saturday night's performance at St. Paul's Ordway Center for
the Performing Arts, the audience gave Lemper and conductor Andreas Delfs
enthusiastic applause.  She was called back to the stage several times.  One
would guess that it was the performance that the audience so heartily
endorsed rather than Brecht's message, which is that capitalism is inherently
evil. ..."

Invisible value distribution in sweater-receiver games instructs us to
distinguish between warps by way of sending a costly signal. The top will
differentiate themselves by not signaling, or countersignaling. Yet
everything that needs to be gathered unravels and it's healthy enough to
produce "idea germ cells" joined from the signaling medium. This beats the
pants off.

This little treatise on the lovely language we share is only for the brave.=20
It was passed on by a linguist, original author unknown. Peruse at your=20
leisure, English lovers.
=A0
=A0
Reasons why the English language is so hard to learn:
=A0
=A0 =A01) The bandage was wound around the wound.
=A0
=A0 2) The farm was used to produce produce.
=A0
=A0 =A03) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse.
=A0
=A0 =A04) We must polish the Polish furniture.
=A0
=A0 =A05) He could lead if he would get the lead out.
=A0
=A0 =A06) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.
=A0
=A0 =A07) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to
=A0 present the present.
=A0
=A0 =A08) A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum.
=A0
=A0 =A09) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.
=A0
=A0 =A010) I did not object to the object.
=A0
=A0 =A011) The insurance was invalid for the invalid.
=A0
=A0 =A012) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row.
=A0
=A0 =A013) They were too close to the door to close it.
=A0
=A0 =A014) The buck does funny things when the does are present.
=A0
=A0 =A015) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line.
=A0
=A0 =A016) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow.
=A0
=A0 =A017) The wind was too strong to wind the sail.
=A0
=A0 =A018) After a number of injections my jaw got number.
=A0
=A0 =A019) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear inside the she=
d.
=A0
=A0 =A020) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests.
=A0
=A0 =A021) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend?


English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant, nor ham in=20
hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't=20
invented in England nor French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while=
=20
sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.
=A0
=A0
We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that=20
quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is=20
neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but=20
fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?
=A0
=A0
If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One=20
goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2indices? Doesn't it seem=20
crazy that you can make amends but not one amend. If you have a bunch of odd=
s=20
and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?
=A0
If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats=20
vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?
=A0
Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum=20
for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and pla=
y=20
a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and fee=
t=20
that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise=
=20
man and a wise guy are opposites?
=A0=20
You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house ca=
n=20
burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and=20
in which, an alarm goes off by going on.
=A0
=A0
English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativit=
y=20
of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all.That is why, when=20
the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are=20
invisible.
=A0
P.S. Why doesn't "Buick" rhyme with "quick"?

from Charlotte Mandel  -- I'm pleased to forward this announcement from
Cynthia Hogue -  Congratulations to Cynthia and co-editor Laura Hinton --
     The University of Alabama Press presents We Who Love to Be Astonished:
 Experimental Women's Writing and Performance Poetics, ed. by Laura Hinton
and Cynthia Hogue, now available.  Susan Schultz writes: "This is an important
 collection, especially in its emphasis on multicultural experimental
writing, and on differences between modes of experimental writing."  We Who
Love to Be Astonished collects a powerful group of previously unpublished
essays to fill a gap in the critical evaluation of women's contributions to
postmodern experimental writing.  Contributors include Eileen Gregory, Susan
McCabe, and Rachel Blau DuPlessis; discussions include analyses of the work
of Kathleen Fraser, Harryette Mullen, and Alice Notley, among others.

I am hoping that since so many of you on the list have years of experience in academia, someone might offer me some insight or advice (okay, even sympathy!) regarding this story.

A little over two years ago, I was a dean and associate prof. (creative writing/poetry) at a small art college.  For financial reasons, this college merged with a nearby liberal arts college, which has since become a university.  Once the merger took place, I was moved to the campus of the university and took on an administrative position.  All of this happened in a congenial atmosphere.  My first supervisor at the new job was a wonderful woman who encouraged me to submit a proposal for an interdisciplinary low-residency MFA program that I had written/created from scratch.  I did so, and everyone became excited about it. It successfully went through various university approval processes and was about to be examined (and, we believed, approved) by the state board of higher ed.  All through the process I was promised (verbally) that once the program was approved, I would direct it.  I had done incredible amounts of very detailed work, much of it on my own time, to create a viab
 le model.   However, my lovely supervisor moved on, and she was replaced by a very strange, unbalanced individual, who did not like me because (I later learned) I knew people in other colleges from which she had been dismissed, and could have told stories about her (I didn’t).  In spite of the fact that my program was moving rapidly toward final approval, she found a way to let me go---a technical “non-renewal,” based on imaginary budgetary concerns.

Yesterday I heard from a friend that this university went ahead with the state board approval process, and is about to announce (or perhaps already has announced, today) that they will offer this very program in the coming academic year.  I’m fairly sure I have no legal grounds for a challenge here (and even if I did, I could probably not afford the time and money involved), but I have a burning desire to DO something.  I do NOT want to go back to work there; that's not the goal. I guess what I’m asking is:  have any of you had experiences like this, and, if so, is there anything to be done beyond writing letters to various university officials (having been an administrator, I know how useless that exercise can be)?

I would be interested in any comments anyone has.  Backchannel is fine.
Many thanks,
Diane Wald

Yes but is it a formal concern? It is but ae journals not also formal or
"formal" or they hae a structure or can build into a structure? A lot of
questions start here. What I did  for a short adult course (or attempted was
to open up the question of what poetry was. Then I tried to convey that a)
there is the historical and formal aspect (which formal aspect is obviously
still very significant) : and many of these people who were a bit
conservative in their approach (but not always so didn know he various terms
for metre  and the forms you talk of - some of which I'd learnt long ago at
school or learnt more recently - nor much history of modern or more recent
poetry and if they knew of Eliot Yeats and some had heard of W CW etc I dont
think many knew of Bishop or any of the NewYork school .. but poeple often
know mre than one realises.... for b) I treied to get them into the journal
idea: to kind of keep a scrapboook or wahtever, a journal, in which they
"experimented" so while they practice d "traditional" things as an artist
"learns they rules so's e can break em" (Bernstein says somewehere he doesnt
want to learn anybrrules...but one needs to know the formal countable
things...but be "practising" the random "leave-off" n the middle.
    So the questionof what and how to "teach" or inspire poetry becomes
more  a philosophico-poetico-polictico an even a personal thing. Certainly
its got to be an experience that makes those involved think: "yes , I'll try
that, know I dont like that,  but (she/he) the teacher or motivator ot
helper is very enthusiastic and makes it so interesting ..." I say this
without irony - and the  student or poet to be then is hopefully motivated
to be self-motivated and so on.
   Another example was when I read out some Gertrude Stein: people labled it
"elitist"   - why I dont know: but she is and has been a poet who most
apart from the writer Beckett and John Ashbery and maybe some of the Langpos
and some of the European potes, most inspires (d) me.
  Just some thoughts.  Regards, Richard.

My suggestion, Diane, is to write this story over and over again.  But next
time, name names.
Best wishes--I know how savage can be CW politics.

>
> A little over two years ago, I was a dean and associate prof. (creative
writing/poetry) at a small art college.  For financial reasons, this college
merged with a nearby liberal arts college, which has since become a
university.  Once the merger took place, I was moved to the campus of the
university and took on an administrative position.  All of this happened in
a congenial atmosphere.  My first supervisor at the new job was a wonderful
woman who encouraged me to submit a proposal for an interdisciplinary
low-residency MFA program that I had written/created from scratch.  I did
so, and everyone became excited about it. It successfully went through
various university approval processes and was about to be examined (and, we
believed, approved) by the state board of higher ed.  All through the
process I was promised (verbally) that once the program was approved, I
would direct it.  I had done incredible amounts of very detailed work, much
of it on my own time, to create a via!

by a very strange, unbalanced individual, who did not like me because (I
later learned) I knew people in other colleges from which she had been
dismissed, and could have told stories about her (I didn't).  In spite of
the fact that my program was moving rapidly toward final approval, she found
a way to let me go---a technical "non-renewal," based on imaginary budgetary
concerns.

state board approval process, and is about to announce (or perhaps already
has announced, today) that they will offer this very program in the coming
academic year.  I'm fairly sure I have no legal grounds for a challenge here
(and even if I did, I could probably not afford the time and money
involved), but I have a burning desire to DO something.  I do NOT want to go
back to work there; that's not the goal. I guess what I'm asking is:  have
any of you had experiences like this, and, if so, is there anything to be
done beyond writing letters to various university officials (having been an
administrator, I know how useless that exercise can be)?

Hello Damian,

We calculate integrals to identify the area under a curve.  The area
between the graph of a function and, say, the x-axis, is a geometric
representation of the aggregate value of that function over an interval.
The "s" like sign that Zukofsky uses in this poem is a concrete
exhibition of the mathematical symbol for integral.  This, called the
definite (or Riemann) integral, has a lower and upper limit.  When
expressed this way the area under a curve is calculated over the range
of the two limits.  "Music" and "speech" are the two limits that LZ
would be calculating the area from.  In essence, he is saying that his
poetics is a multi-dimensional space between speech and music.

I also got hold of that book by Mary Oliver: some of the things she says are
very insightful and it would fit in with that "part" of a course that dealt
with the technicalities, the prosody, and the more traditional aspects of
poetry. But she says somewhere of a student that she made the mistake of
repeating each word in a poem and that was (well she disapproved greatly)
that disapproval worried me! You do a poem such as:   I I I I I WENT WENT
WENT WENT WENT  DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN THE THE THE THE THE ROAD ROAD ROAD
ROAD ROAD TO TO TO TO TO SEE SEE SEE SEE SEE  and a (metaphorical
ruler )would slap down hard and hurtingly on your (real?) wrist ... but its
still a good and efficient book.  I also got  some ineresting things packed
away somewhere I think they were lectures by Jackson Macklow  or Ron Padget
(at the Naropa Institute)..wait, here it is, "Talking Poetics at the Naropa
Institute" published by Shambhala, 1978...(Diane di Prima (who claims that
poetry is made out of light: very poetic!!), Padgett, Ginsberg, Ducan,W S
Burroughs, Cage, Ted Berrigan, Ed Dorn, Michael McClure and Clark
Coolidge...come to think of it this is probably quite rare...immm...the
bookseller in me.. with a lot of experiments and clearly they were getting
straight into the action so to speak: trying new ways. There's a book in New
Zealand which is called (sorry I'd have to do a search on abe or addall by
author or phone the library tommorow) but its by a New Zealandised
(originally American) poet Michael Harlow (whose poetry is worth checking
out by the way ) and I have used it myself to "formalise" and get ew ideas
etc for my wn writing father forgive me if I havent sinned but I copied it
and it has  a page on "A Dada Poem"  which quotes Tristan Tzara on how to
cut upa newsaper randomly and then "shake up" the words and the random poem
that comes out is what you print (if you wish) and he then discusses Dada
(short comment). LikeBernadette Mayer's List of  ideas (on this EPC)  (which
is  also worth handing out  to students and getting them to add more) it
encourages students (anyone ) eg to make a poem or poems even from such as a
newspaper article, or by using a "language selector" (a shape placeed over a
certain kind of writing (a letter eg)) , he demonstrates how "oiems'can be
found on street signs (we think of Siliman and in New Zealand here Alan
Loney has done this with a lot of his poetry: he has jotted down a lot of
public signs and so on and fed them into poems with other words (the random
and the structured) ; the concept titling a poem then creating one from that
concept (one I must try myself); talking of Retallack's  Afterimages that is
an interesting text and Harlow qoutes something by Ladislav Novac which is
almost a concrete poem:


                              O


                          GL    IA

   Some of this might seem "old hat" (especaily to the e-poets) but its
amazing how we (may of us) get "creatively lazy" ..there are other
"experiments" and obviously the aim ultimately is to spark the student or
poet to be or whoever to 'open up' and maybe "out". harlow ends with  the
development and re-writing and rewriting of one of his own poems....this is
something that interests me very much that is the process of the process:
but Harlow finishes with his final  "best" version" but by this time I'm
loving al the attempts and the way the variations in his poem arise and so
on and I WANT the crossings out and the imperfections and I want him to go
on and on with his reorkings... This book was written in conjucntion with
Bill Manhire (or with his assistance)  whose creative writing school at
Victoria University (Wellington, New Zealand ) has been very influential and
successful (if you want "succcessful")(although its been accused of creating
"Manhire clones") ( possibly  a variant of "official verse") but I think
that's  maybe from bitterness of poets and writers who are not significantly
"published" but I  dont know. But I think that one thing Manhire said was
interesting "Write about what you know, and what you dont know."
  A book I came across by chance is: "Let Them Write Poetry" by Nina Willis
Walter. Its for teaching children but the ideas and exercises could be
extrapolated for older students. Without being sentimental or "gooey" I
think many children write with extraordinary beauty and originality which we
older poetico-dinosauruses (word for lizards?) lack..or could do with
hearing/reading to refuel!
  As is noted below a of of language or post language poems are "poems in
action" or how poems are made as they are made so to speak with more
attention to the physicality of the poem and the politic and the poetics and
so on: I think a teacher or "motivator" has to believe that a creative
capacity is in all of us and it should be encouraged (with appropriate
"criticisms" or more likely suggestions where those are relevant)...I dont
teach anyone at the moment myself and have only done so with poetry once and
some coaching of high school students ) but I would encourage: a passionate
belief in people and in the value of creativity of any kind. Construction
and invention rather than moronic militaristic and robotic destruction of
things we "fear"...Discourage  "The Fear of the Unknown". In this repect
evryone on the earth should study and read "Your Erroneous Zones " by Dr
Wayne Dyer which has that as one of its chapters. Of all the literature I've
read it could all burn as long as I could remember the concepts of that
book: obviously I'd want to retain the literature as well......
   With writing (as opposed to painting  etc) there seems to be les need for
exercises in technique (as our "practice" is all the reading and writing we
do through school etc and as we grow) but it would be good to be ABLE to be
an Auden and be able to produce just abut any kind of poeic form or style.
Good luck with your course. Richard.

This little treatise on the lovely language we share is only for the brave.
It was passed on by a linguist, original author unknown. Peruse at your
leisure, English lovers.


Reasons why the English language is so hard to learn:

1) The bandage was wound around the wound.

2) The farm was used to produce produce.

3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse.

4) We must polish the Polish furniture.

5) He could lead if he would get the lead out.

6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.

7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to
present the present.

8) A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum.

9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.

10) I did not object to the object.

11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid.

12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row.

13) They were too close to the door to close it.

14) The buck does funny things when the does are present.

15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line.

16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow.

17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail.

18) After a number of injections my jaw got number.

19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear inside the shed.

20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests.

21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend?


English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant, nor ham in
hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't
invented in England nor French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while
sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.


We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that
quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is
neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that writers write but
fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?


If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One
goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese? One index, 2indices? Doesn't it seem
crazy that you can make amends but not one amend. If you have a bunch of
odds
and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?

If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats
vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?

Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum
for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and
play
a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and
feet
that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise
man and a wise guy are opposites?

You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house
can
burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and
in which, an alarm goes off by going on.


English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the
creativity
of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all.That is why, when
the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are
invisible.

P.S. Why doesn't "Buick" rhyme with "quick"?

31 October - 3 November, 2002
University of Wisconsin, Madison

The MSA

Founded in 1999, the Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the
study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual
contexts from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth. Through
its annual conferences and its journal,Modernism/Modernity, the organization
seeks to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum for exchange
among scholars in this revitalized and rapidly expanding field. For more
information, please see our web site at
http://msa.press.jhu.edu/

The fourth annual Modernist Studies Association Conference will be held
at the Monona Terrace Convention Center, a building designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright on the shores of Lake Monona in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. Sponsored
by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the conference will feature plenaries,
panels, seminars, poetry readings, and film screenings related to the study of
modernism and modernity.

Calls for seminar and panel proposals follow. Please note that the
deadline for seminar proposals is 15 February 2002, the deadline for panel
proposals 1 May 2002. Please note also that MSA rules do not allow
participants to lead a seminar and present a paper for a panel at the same
conference. Participants may present a panel paper and participate in a
seminar, or chair a panel and lead a seminar.

All who attend the MSA Conference must be members of the organization
with dues paid for 2002.

CALL FOR SEMINAR LEADERS
Deadline: 15 February 2002

SEMINARS

Participation of conferees in seminars is one of the most significant
features of the MSA conference. Seminars are small-group discussion sessions
for which participants write brief "position papers" that are read and
circulated prior to the conference. Seminars generate lively and valuable
exchange during the conference and in some cases havecreated a network of
scholars who have continued to work together. Further, the seminar model allows
most conferees to seek financial support from their institutions as they
educate themselves and their colleagues on subjects of mutual interest.

SEMINAR TOPICS

There are no limits on topics. Past experience has shown that the more
clearly defined the topic and the more guidance provided by the leader, the
more useful the discussion has been to people's individual projects. Seminar
topics at the 2001 MSA conference included "Literary Modernism and Visual
Culture, "Modernism and Masculinity," and "New Approaches to Little Magazines."
For a full listing, see the MSA Web site.

PROPOSING A SEMINAR

Seminar proposals must include the following information. Please assist
us by sending this information in exactly the order given here. Use as a
subject line:

department, mailing address, phone, fax, and e-mail address

Seminars will be selected in late March. Please note that participants
may not present a paper and lead a seminar at the same conference. Participants
may present a panel paper and participate in a seminar, or chair a panel and
lead a seminar.

LEADING A SEMINAR

The MSA will advertise seminars and register participants. To promote
discussion, the size of seminars is limited to a maximum of 15. Leaders may, at
their option, invite one or two individuals to join the seminar in some special
role. Some leaders will wish to share the work of reading and responding to
papers with the invited participants; others will simply want to assure a
high standard of discussion by involving scholars whose work they know
to be important for their topic. Please note that invited participants will not
be specially listed as such in the conference program.

E-mail addresses for all seminar registrants will be provided to seminar
leaders in May. At that time, leaders should

·       Initiate communications by e-mail, introducing themselves
and providing addresses to all participants.

·       Set guidelines for the seminar. These might include questions to
be addressed, readingto be done, and a specified length
for the position papers (normally 5-7 pages).
·       Set firm deadlines, no later than mid-September for the actual
exchange of papers.
·       Exchange and read papers during the 6-8 weeks before the
conference.
·       Plan the seminar format. The MSA will provide guidance, but
leaders are, within reasonable limits, free to use the time
(two hours) as they see fit.

Wilbur,
I'm sure you'll get lots of response to this query, but I thought I'd =
chime in. I found "C" in its fullest form at Syracuse University special =
collections, though I think you can also find a full run at NYU's Fales =
collection, and, I'd imagine, Wisconsin-Madison. I'm just copying the =
following stuff on "C"'s format whole-cloth from a chapter I wrote on =
Berrigan. Hope it's helpful...

In "Some Notes about 'C'," Berrigan claims that "the first issue of "C" =
was deliberately put together by me to reflect the SIMILARITY of the =
poetry, since I felt the differences to be obvious, and the NEWNESS of =
such a point of view as we (I) had." Towards that end, he left out page =
numbers and names of individual authors from the body of the issue, and =
limited the information in the table of contents to the number of poems =
included by each of the four contributors--an even more radical =
departure from conventional modes of authorial attribution than Corman's =
play with Origin's table of contents. While it is possible to =
distinguish amongst the works of Berrigan, Dick Gallup and Ron Padgett, =
the formatting choices conspire against it. All of the poems (with the =
exception of the Joe Brainard's "diary" and "play") fill approximately =
the same amount of space on the legal-sized pages; both Padgett and =
Berrigan include poems titled "Sonnet" in their selections; lines echo =
across contributors. Berrigan's "A fragmentary music clears the room" =
responds as much to Gallup's "endless resoundings fill the room" as it =
does to the source line from Ashbery's "Two Scenes." Like The Sonnets, =
the magazine stands as one work in conversation with itself. =20

In the fourth issue, the hermetic organization of the first three issues =
gives way to a more public, even academic mode. Devoted to Denby's =
sonnets, this issue contains an essay on his work by O'Hara (originally =
printed in Poetry magazine), as well as an introduction by John Wieners =
and a Notes section at the end. The front and back covers, designed by =
Andy Warhol, feature photographs of Denby and Gerard Malanga--elderly =
and distinguished and darkly handsome, respectively--in various stages =
of embrace. On the "question of taste" raised by the image of the two =
men kissing, Berrigan cites O'Hara's cocktail party quip as the "final =
word": "if poetry can't survive a little faggotism, then I don't know =
what can!" ("Some Notes" 10).

hello list,

can anyone tell me a bit about the format -- general layout etc. -- of =
Ted
Berrigan's magazine "C"?


I'd really appreciate this info, as copies are hard to find (I havent =

able to fine any, yet) -- and I need this for a project I'm doing.

Thanks for all the suggestions. Really: thanks.  After looking into a number
of the options more closely, I've decided to use the Koch book _Making Your
Own Days_. It looks perfect and it's only $15 (instead of $58 for _Strong
Measures_).  Additionally I will have them buy copies of the latest Fence.

Diane,

Well, next time , I hope that you get a faculty position in a unionized
college/university.  It is neither safe nor fulfilling to be an
administrator.  Besides, why would one want to be on anyway?  That said,
there are legal arguments that your work-product belongs to your
institution.  On the other hand, if you can show a commitment in writing
that speaks for your claims, you might have an argument.  At the very
least, try the Chronicle.

THEY GO INTO ANOTHER BRIGHTLINE SHOOTING SESSION:old julu-program, hold me
in good staid, in the glade azure and i with stubbles, she's mouthing
bubbles, her cunt's a brilliant light against the ferns, my face burns
with rubbles and anticipation, drools, i'm pissing in the saw palmetto,
my bellies huge, like rouge her labia, i'm all wet drowning in her stream,
that part's a dream, her tunnel's lit, did i say at night the flashlight
shows us path and swath, my cock's cut on spanish bayonet, i fuck a pine,
she's mine, she says i'm your hole, use me, her skirt's hiked up, she's
all smiles for miles, my thick lips drool on my tool, we're rattling in
dark dank muck, we fuck :4:2 i hold her asshole open next to saw grass cut
to hold the dew in two, we're like glue, stuck in fuck, the cameras
chatter, our holes spatter the last drop or plop into each other's eyes,
shit's no surprise, we wallow in the hollow, old julu-program lie me like
your maid, don't let me fade, azure's been made and made again, i'm her
maid-man and then :blown bellies out, her crack's blurred against the stem
or trunk, a hunk, you might miss her ass, she looks a lass, shaved, i'm
perfectly behaved, my balls are thick and musk, my cock a tusk, my laugh
is long and hard, she's my bard, she's tearing at my skin, she wants me
in, the glade's wet with piss and semen, it smells like perfect water,
azure looks a daughter, i'm her rutted father covered with her lather,
just wet hair everywhere and bare there

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" ; format="flowed"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

Amherst, MA--JUBILAT announces the publication of its fourth issue,=20
an arresting mix of poetry, art,  interviews and prose that=20
simultaneously enlivens and challenges the very definition of a=20
literary journal.

JUBILAT 4 includes never-before-published selections from Pulitzer=20
prize-winning poet George Oppen's Daybooks; new translations of=20
Eugenio Montejo (winner of Venezuela's National Prize for=20
Literature), French Surrealist Paul =C9luard, and Israeli children's=20
book author and poet Nurit Zarchi; the first major interview with=20
acclaimed poet Dean Young; and new work by an array of emerging and=20
established talents including Reginald Sheperd, Andrzej Sosnowski,=20
Liz Waldner, Russell Edson, and John Ashbery. In keeping with=20
JUBILAT's belief that, to poetry, everything is relevant, JUBILAT 4=20
also presents a Chinese menu of dishes inspired by late T'ang Dynasty=20
poems and a selection of images made from ink signatures from the=20
1920s & '30s.

Only two years old, JUBILAT has quickly made a name for itself as one=20
of the most exciting new journals to make its way into print. Work=20
from recent issues has been selected for inclusion in Best American=20
Poetry 2001 & 2002, and for reprint in Harper's Magazine.

Twice yearly JUBILAT delivers more than 150 pages of the best in=20
contemporary poetry along with art, interviews and prose. Part of the=20
unique focus of the journal is to offer a forum for poets to publish=20
prose pieces on a wide variety of subjects which may or may not have=20
anything to do with poetry. In addition, JUBILAT re-introduces lost=20
or neglected talent that may have been passed over by the standard=20
canon or otherwise deserves a wider audience, such as Christopher=20
Smart and John Clare. Past issues have also included work by Sappho,=20
Bob Perelman, Paul Celan, Nathaniel Mackey, Odysseus Elytis, Claudia=20
Rankine, James Tate, Jane Miller, Vasko Popa, Pierre Reverdy, Jorie=20
Graham, and Heather McHugh.

"JUBILAT is already handsomely unpredictable, and the reader turns=20
its pages often in sheer aesthetic excitement. I can think of only a=20
few -- very few -- journals with this variety and openness," wrote=20
the late poet and translator Agha Shahid Ali, who was also a beloved=20
friend and Contributing Editor to the journal.

"JUBILAT is stunning both inside and out, a magnificent contribution=20
to the literary magazine in America and the world," says poet and=20
editor Gillian Conoley.

"I love JUBILAT because it isn't jaded or sleeping or cynical; it's=20
open to everything a 21st century literary venue needs to make a=20
place for itself in the vast cacophony of writing we call the=20
literary world," says poet Dara Wier.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello e-Peoples,

As you know, Readme got moved around a bit last year. It now has a new
address, and I think I've gotten all the internal links taken care of, too.
(Let me know of any that are still wrong.) The new address is:

http://home.jps.net/~nada

Please update your links, if you have any.

Issue five was delayed for numerous reasons, but I'm putting it together
now. Lots of stuff is in house or being worked on now, including dialogues
between Allison Cobb & Jen Coleman, Eleni Sikelianos and Laird Hunt ...
interviews with Cole Heinowitz, Alan Davies, Michael Gottlieb, Eileen Myles,
Lytle Shaw, Larry Kearney, Rodrigo Toscano, Ron Silliman (part II of II) ...
a special section on art & poetry edited by Eileen Tabios ... Catullus
translations by Don Cheney ... reviews of Amnasan, Blevins, Cobb, Dobelmann,
Gladman, Goldman, Hunt, Sharma, Shaw, D. Smith, etc.!

I'm still interested in getting a few more dialogues, interviews, reviews
and essays for this issue. If you're interested, please send completed
piece(s) or query, whatever you like. Length/topics are up to you -- if it
fits, it fits. Deadline: March 1st.

Thanks!

Gary

alan and azure spend themselves, exhaust themselves. they turn
themselves into debris, into excretion, detritus. you will know
them naked, know their lesions, their gonorrheas, syphilis, their
hiv, their herpes, their disjunctions. you will know their torn
bodies, bodies on the brink of war. you will know alan's flaccid
cock, his aging body, azure's young tumescent body, their
bruised breasts and necks. when you see them you will see
through them. they will confuse this with politics, with exile,
with refugee. you will know alan's heavy belly, azure's small
labia, alan's asshole aureole, azure's small tight hole. you will
know shoulders that bear the brunt of worlds, minds discarding
clothes, their pathetic truths, the groping in their eyes. you will
grope them in confusion. you will fall for them. they are just
like this, lesions you will fall for. they are ruined. they ruined
each other. you can have them for all they care.

I want to thank Mark, Kevin, Bob, and Richard for your
generous replies on- and off-list. I'm enamored of
Richard's idea that Zukofsky's integral sign looks like a
violin's f-hole. Also I'm very interested in the distinction
several of you alluded to between aggregates and specific
values, the former being the province of integration; LZ
insisted on "historical and contemporary particulars" at
the local level but was also interested, clearly, in
poetics as an ahistoric space or field of activity that
could be mapped conceptually, and within which (I think
this is the implication) every point in the designated
range would be represented or at least implied -- a life's
work with "A"'s scope being necessary to fulfill that
projection. A sense, too, of free motion within the field,
a flexibility to at any point veer towards raw speech or
pure music, and perhaps to imply the whole when either is
invoked.

Thanks again,
Damian

Thanks very much to all who responded/backchanneled.  Helpful.  And yes, Susan, you are
right---others have suggested I should have named the place.  So, for everyone's information, it's
Lesley University in Cambridge, MA.
Cheers,

Hi All,

A disabled woman has contacted me about online poetry workshops.  I
suggested she check out Teachers and Writers and Naropa's online
courses.  Any other suggestions?  She can't afford private tutoring.

Thanks.

I've corrected the masterpiece submitted previously: if it is  not yet in
regular metre and the rhyme scheme not quite "aligned":at least in my own
defence I defer that the syllable count is eight per line which is that
which what counts. Richard.

Subject:      Poets Theater Opening San Francisco Friday 1/18/02
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

If you're in San Francisco this week I hope you can come to the
opening of "Jubilee," the poets theater festival we've been working
on since March.

There will be five events, something happening every weekend of which
I'll try to tell you more as the days go on by.

On Friday January 18 at 8 p.m. at the Jon Sims Center ( 1519 Mission
Street, between 11th and South Van Ness) will be the premiere of two
new plays, both of them oddly enough collaborations, first there will
be a short play "Reduced" by Rachel Levitsky and Camille Roy.  Lauren
Gudath and Sarah Rosenthal take the two main parts, attended by a
chorus of gossips played by among others Camille Roy herself, me,
Mark Ewert and Dodie Bellamy--coaxed back from her self-imposed
retirement from the stage.

A longer play follows, "Art Colony Survivor,"  which Norma Cole and I
have been writing every Saturday for months and months.  The play is
a bit different than anything I have ever written--it has a
philosophic bent foreign to my nature -- but I'm sure you will like
it all the same.  Many local poets and visual artists are taking part
in this play, which is based on incidents in the life of the composer
Ruth Crawford Seeger.  Our leading lady is the painter Laurie Reid.
If you liked her work at the last Whitney Biennial, you will love her
work in this.  Making the opposite career move, the writer Brent
Cunningham has turned to big gouache water colors and papier-mache to
do all the sets for our play!  Thus the separate worlds of poetry and
visual art we try to conflate!  "Art Colony Survivor" is a
multi-media extravaganza, with tape and video insertions that will
knock your eyes and ears out.  Anyway try to come if you can, it'll
be both something different and something reassuringly the same.
Call ahead for reservations (415) 554-0402.

JUBILEE will continue for four weeks (14 new plays in all, and one
revival) as a joint project of Small Press Traffic, New Langton Arts,
and Jon Sims Center for the Arts.  These 3 organizations will join up
as never before to help us celebrate the eons-long tradition of Poets
Theater.

Thanks everyone!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

hello,

IN the preface to _The Politics of Poetic Form_ Bernstein paraphrases
Oppen thusly, "... and George Oppen's revision: that poets are the legislators
of the unacknowledged world." (vii)

Can someone provide me with the source for this (Oppen)? It will probably
be
impossible for me to get a copy of the book it is from considering wher I
write this from. So, if someone could
give me as much of the poem as possible and all the attendant
bibliographical information they would make a fellow with a masters thesis
to hand in in five days very grateful.

I hope this makes sense.

Backchannel, of course, is fine.

Thanks,
Kevin
St. John's, NF

The Germ & the Poetic Research Bureau (Western Office)

present

Karen MacCormack & Steve McCaffery at Dawsons, Sunday 4pm!

***

Man alive, it's season five! And no pennyweight bundle to be sure, with
upcoming visits from Jacques Roubaud, Tom Raworth, Mary Jo Bang, Stephen
Rodefer, Michael Palmer, and a fantasy pack of other druthers. This season
also begins the PRB's hat trick co-op with Otis College of Art & Design on
many dates, greasing the wheel and reeling in yet more challenging writers
to dip a hand in our gray basin. And to the present, kids...

The Poetic Research Series reignites next Sunday with a fly-right visit from
the impulse turbines of Toronto! What a date, junior, these are my faves
too. Poets with cheek and gum, and no little bite! But post-semiotic my
foot, these are mainline syllab streakers and clear to the ear, and
somewhere between the bust-up and the quirk, it all points to a madcap
mouthful! Sunday Jan 20 at Dawsons Book Shop.

I note with pleasure that Rod Smith Nada Gordon and some other guy are
reading tomorrow night at the Drawing Center in Tribeca. The following
Tuesday I will be reading at O'Neal's Tavern in Midtown. More exact
coordinates: Third Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets, on the East Side
of Manhattan, 1/22, 6:30 pm. Some praise the nachos, others admire the
fries, while I enjoy the chicken tenders with my pint of Caffreys. This
will be a fine opportunity for New York-bound poets to meet the pension
fund employee crowd. And in the spirit of the occasion, I print a list of
British drinking age rules, as accompany a story at news.bbc.co.uk about
the Queen finding her son's handling of her grandson's underage drinking
quite correct.

Licensing laws

Illegal for under 18s to buy alcohol anywhere
16 and 17-year-olds can buy beer, porter, cider or perry with a meal not
served in a bar
Under 18s cannot drink in a bar but those aged five or more can elsewhere
in licensed premises

Perry, of course, is hard pear cider.

Bless you all,
Jordan

I'm passing this along for Hermine Meinhard--


New Poetry Class Offered by
The New York Writers Workshop at the JCC


The Soul of a Poem
The soul or core of a poem lies in what is hidden, fleeting or nonrational.
This workshop will help students draw on those elusive aspects of experience
that give a poem its depth and mystery. Emphasis will be on in-class
improvisational  exercises, using objects, language and outside texts to
spur associational thinking. We will experiment with direct and indirect
ways of approaching material and with extending our range through
nontraditional uses of language and silence. And, working with journals, we
will explore the variety of ways a poem can come into existence through
rapid generation of text, fragments, accidents and mis-readings.

       Wednesdays, January 30 - April 10, 7-9 p.m., Jewish Community Center,
15 W. 65th St., NYC

Hermine Meinhard is poetry editor of the literary journal 3rd bed. She has
been a finalist the past three years for Four Way Books Levis and Intro
Prizes, was the winner of the Sue Saniel Elkind Poetry Award and a Pushcart
Prize nominee. Her poems have appeared or are forthcoming  in Luna, Sonora
Review, Willow Springs, The Prose Poem; Poetry New York, 13th Moon and other
journals.  She also teaches at NYU.

For further information: hmeinhard@lincolncenter.org

Registration at the JCC: 212-580-0299, press 4, or in person Sun.-Fri., 334
Amsterdam Ave., (at 76th St.)

AMERICAN BAGGIE


A plastic grocery bag does an elegant dance against a brick wall back
drop.  A teenage boy gazes into its movements mesmerized by the crinkled
pirouettes, its undulating sweeps, its flesh-like painterly tremblings.
Up it swirls into a cadence of stars only to fall abruptly through
absent breath around the boy’s head.  The wind cinches the bag’s handles
in a knot around his neck.  The boy’s head bloats and turns dark purple
behind the ragged visage of the bag.  The boy is now floating up against
a brick wall backdrop in an elegant dance, in crinkled pirouettes, in
undulating sweeps of flesh-like painterly tremblings.


THE FOGGY SCALP

Out to sea this evening I watch the horizon line buckle and snap under
the weight of the setting sun.  Two distinct green sticks collapse
inward towards each other pulling in the drowning sea.  Only to be
replaced by a single sky made of matted hair and skin cells in octagonal
patches.  This sure baffles the captain and his deck hands who have run
aground in the great scalp with the wrong tool for the job.  Now during
those long crossings they just sit around scratching themselves, staring
into the foggy scalp



ONE THUMB BOOK


I am building a little book for my thumb, where I will shovel lint from
the street’s navel and juice lullabies from the treetops.  It is a book
of elastic steel married to song.  An opposable piano picked up in
Mozambique.  Each page a print, a maze of jagged feet clamoring up the
stairwell of your spine.  This a gnarled tornado as opposed to a combed
one.  This a hairy coin of sorts, the flipping of which is the fondling
of crude feathers, where we memorialize the world record holder in the
pole vault.



WALKING THE DOG


I’m off to walk the dog this morning, when I notice my hat’s on fire.  I
run upwards trying to flag down a saturated cloud.  No luck, the fire
spreads into my scalp and head starting a smoldering root fire in my
cranium.  I think, “wow, like, accelerated honey shed from the core of
the sun”.  No matter, the dog must be walked.  “No fire as mad as the
unwalked dog”  I yap into the flames, flesh bubbling up popping off
bone.  Soon enough I am walking an ashen self on an ashen leash, the
neighbors asking ashen questions, the dog barking forth some ashen
answers.


HEAVEN HAS LAYERS


Some mysterious surgeons with silent hands showed up at the factory one
day.  I blacked out with fear being held in some chasm of water turned
to fire.  There were murmurings of invisible animals I questioned, and
then laughter rang out from the lava swamp.  What can I say of the
factory basement, the less-than-beautiful sight of me coming to, in
flames.  Rising up through the office, past shipping & handling, the
public area, reception, all less pretty than the previous layers.  I
rise, the surgeons follow, chasing me with clacking scalpels and hoods
of dark gauze— through all the layers I hated to work.  And so I had
stolen an umbrella, to catch a warm updraft, rising toward the ceiling
like an unpeeled scar, into the umbrella shaped skylight, and out of the
grasp of the crimson surgeon’s hands.

TEXTUAL OPERATIONS
organized by A.S. BESSA
______________________________________________
WEDNESDAY JANUARY 16 at 8PM

CRAIG DWORKIN
"Against Meaning"

Introduced by Brian Stefans

In "Against Meaning", Craig Dworkin proposes a radically new way of
readingóone that proceeds without regard to theme or content or
referential meaning, and yet still retains the explanatory powers and
pleasures we associate with reading. With examples from both
experimental and conventional writingófrom George Oppen and Guillaume
Apollinaire to Robert Frost and Elizabeth Bishopóthis talk will
illustrate what we might call an 'applied paragrammatics': how to engage
texts on their own terms while sidestepping the familiar lull of their
normative grammars. Craig Dworkin is a writer and professor at Princeton
University. He has recently published in October and Sagetrieb, and
"Reading the Illegible", a critical study of artistic appropriation and
misuse is forthcoming from Northwestern University Press.

New O Books: GEORGE OPPEN, A RADICAL PRACTICE by Susan Thackrey, $12.00, =
80 pages, ISBN # 1-882022-41-6. Available from Small Press Distribution: =
1341 Seventh St. Berkeley, CA 94710.
"Susan Thackrey dares the risk of stepping into the heart of Oppen's =
lifelong philosophic andrtistic task." (Steve Dickison, poet and =
Director of the SF Poetry Center).
"Susan Thackrey's essay provides a deep and precise account of Oppen as =
intellectual and as poet. It is especially noteworthy for its clear and =
persuasive account of how the poem can be 'mind in the world, coming =
into being, not mind or world, not one being a content or about the =
other.' And I cannot think of a more incisive account of how Heidegger =
mattered for Oppen and can matter for contemporaries." -- Charles =
Altieri, critic)

this important series of exchanges between poets. Participants included Ron
Silliman, Jeff Derksen, Bruce Andrews, Steve McCaffery, Karen McCormack,
Lisa Robertson, Jackson Mac Low, Andrew Levy, Kevin Davies, Sianne Ngai, and
many others.

Witz

Witz: A Journal of Contemporary Poetics ceased publication in 1999 after
seven years and 20 issues. Most of their run is online in either .pdf or
HTML format; includes writing, reviews and interviews by Clint Burnham,
Susan Smith Nash, Jacques Debrot, Juliana Spahr, Peter Quartermain, and
others.

Alt-x

Another project by Mark Amerika, Alt-x doesn't ask "what is literature" so
much as "what is literature's exit strategy" (or at least that's what the
propaganda states). Started in 1993, Alt-x was leagues ahead in terms of
digital publishing, and you will find here many volumes of poetry, prose and
fiction as well as anthologies of innovative... stuff.

Kenneth Goldsmith's No. 109

Goldsmith composes his books using extreme techniques of data
accumulation -- scanning net archives for two years for phrases ending in
the sound "r" (No. 111), recording everything he's said for a week
(Soliloquy), recording every movement of his body for an entire day
(Fidget), etc. No. 109 (1994) is one of his earlier works, a sort of test
run for No. 111.

/ubu

/ubu ("slash ubu") is a new series that will appear at ubu.com in the
following months. For now, you can download three .pdf's by Richard Foreman.
Future authors will include Kevin Davies, Caroline Bergvall, Alan Davies,
and Ron Silliman.

Cocodrillo

I don't know much about Cocodrillo except that it is a poetry zine edited by
David Cameron, a fairly well-known New Yorker, that is in color, and that it
is out of commish. Several issues of this crocodile-bedecked publication
appear on this site, including writing by poets who straddle the
Nuyorican/experimental scene such as Todd Colby and Edwin Torres.

Geoff Ryman's 253

Geoff Ryman is the author of several innovative novels -- part Oulipian,
part English satirical realism -- and designed this web version of his
multi-perspectived view of a metro line destined for no good ends.  (Not
technically "poetry" but damn well written.)

Floraspirae

An intriguing Flash "glyphabet of plant-breath" based on the writings of
Armand Schwerner by prolific concrete/multimedia poet mIEKAL aND, whose
other recent works include SEEDSIGNS for Philadelpho Menezes.

The Narrative You Anticipate You May Produce

Thomas Swiss's most recent Flash piece, done in collaboration with Seb
Chevrel, uses randomization elements for the visual, sound and textual
elements in an elegant, somewhat "Throw of the Dice" fashion, one of the
more successful uses of randomization in a web poem.

Beehive

Iowa Review Web

Don't ask me why the Iowa writer's program has taken an interest in digital
poetry, but this site, now under the editorship of Thomas Swiss, promises to
be an important portal.

The courses (which cost) and the conferences (which don't) at Trace,
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/ - I find this one of the best writing communities
that I've ever seen (disclaimer, I'm also associated with it). The courses
use WebCt and are configured easily for the students; the Webboard for the
conferences is O'Reilly and equally easy but very busy.

Damian and Listers.  That idea of the shape of the violin I incorporated
into a poem which I'll attempt to unearth: I think it was an oblique
reference to Zukofsky.
 I suppose conceptually "A" is both infinite - if  infinite can be a thing
or exist even in mathematics or philosophy - and also, like human life, it
is finite. He begins "A" as he is listening to Bach: now there is a sense
when listening to Bach of the infinite...for me it is at such times that I
(theoretically an atheist or at least agnostic) feel closest to "God"..Glenn
Gould I heard last year when we had a day of Bach and he spoke about how
Bach was in fact behind the times - already out of date - yet there's
something to use a cliche immutable and timeless in a real sense about
Bach's music: I never tire of it but can tire of any other music...but LZ's
work is complex...in "A" I was fascinated to read the section of "sonnets":
LZ is struggling for "liveforever" (see Michelle Leggott in her book
"Reading Zukofsky's 80 Flowers") and looking for the infinite in the grains:
each flower that he planted was to be written about but as Leggott points
out the permutations in his (each of his 80 poems) are vast and he goes back
into the entymolygy of words and incorporates multiple references meanings
and connotations that maybe rival (perhaps he was trying to emulate or
better) Joyce...for most people its too complex, too involuted and abstruse,
but what I have read of LZ I have found extremely interesting: I bought his
book  "A" recently and have a couple of books of commentary and was going to
struggle through "A"....
  Poetry and writing is always of a spectrum (which is a range of
frequencies) and the spectrum in "A" is thus (rhetorically at least) between
the abstract "purity" of music and that of the (more?) directly human and
(more "meaningful"?) limits of speech: obviously LZ is using a clever
metaphor but it is a good ploy...the speech and the  music are there in the
first section as people chatter about things and then we shift (according to
(not Scroggins (another writer on LZ)) toward an Dantesque hence Eliotsonian
deviation toward "hell", and the music comes back to intrude: the whole work
is like a great symphony or a conception of one: except that it progresses
through LZ's own life (the particulars) and ends with another work of music
which is maybe like a coda: the sonnets (or at least the 14 line poems are
on one level like music as eg Stein's "Stanzas in Meditation" are....
   As you say the "field" can only be mapped conceptually: its a pity that
LZ is not given even such a high profile even as Joyce or Beckett (although
at least some of the hype about Joyce is thus not present): part of the
problem of thesse guys liek LZ is that they are perceived to be "too
cerebral" and young people go for teh Beats and so on or we hear on the NY
Times of someone reading Sharon Olds and Miloscz and Herbert who are all
insignificant poets in contrast...or atleast I feel LZ is avoided for the
wrong readons: some of his apologists are a bit of a worry as well! I must
admit I get a bit irritated by his seeming over-convolution and near
fanatical obsessions with time and numbers and so on: but that's probably a
good sign that I am so irritated.
  Thoughts here in Auckland where it is alternately hot cold sunny raining
like F or whatever. Please send any thoughts on about LZ I must turn to
reading him, but I keep diverting from one book to another..just read some
Chekov stories, before that "The Golden Ass", then I started on a book about
trees! Then found "The Burning Bush" and was reading the chapter on Wagner
Nietsche Dreyfus etc...was reading some (translated) Montale... How's
everyone else coping, living, enjoyning, reading, writing? There it goes its
storming here again and i'm hot as hell inside here where its normally a
cold house..."cold house"
 The contradictions of Wagner who had many Jewish friends and people who
helped him maybe parallels the life of Pound in some ways: who was a friend
of Zukofsky..jabes says that all poets are Jews (and vica versa?) at least I
think  even if we attempt poetry we are wandering, erring, isolating in many
ways, we are all exiles...or is that all more rhetoric?!  Regards, Richard.
PS barry Ahear was the writer I meant. It's sunny again! Aha! Should walk up
Mount Wellington or go for a run... you probably all have the book by Mark
Scroggins ..I've had it for some time but this is worth quoting; (Scroggins
quotes the  passage with the integral sign) "It is characteristic that
Zukovsky would define his poetry in terms borrowed from calculus, he felt
more in common with engineers and scientists than he did with most
poets...In the composer he most admired,[Bach], Zukofsky saw a similar
interest in precision and mathematical strucure...." However, he points out
earlier tat Z's verse "spends more time in the upper limit than in the lower
reaches of this integral [not that speech is precise neccessarily]; it
proposes a species of pleasure  that is more dependent on sound than on
paraphrasable meaning. but this poetry is never meaningless..." [we know
what S is saying but this could be said of any writing]  Oh well, you'e got
me to read or at least look into Mark Scroggin's book and to go over "A".
Wish me luck. Good bye!!!

(http://freespace.virgin.net/reality.street/)

The poets inside are: Mirkka Rekola, Kai Nieminen, Lauri Otonkoski, Tomi
Kontio & Riina Katajavuori.  The renderings are elegant & natural & free of
translatorese: they read well.  Here's a poem of Rekola's:

Sits at the table where I used to sit,
looks out at that street.
        Spoon in coffee cup,
a tinkling like the one a moment ago
in the shore wind by the sailboats.
I consider leaving, not sure I'm considering even that.
Here, I don't meet anyone I know anymore,
I don't even know if there's anyone left,
                if anyone's leaving,
they left here even as they arrived.


Bill Griffiths, _The Ushabtis_.  London: Talus Editions, 2001.
0-9514232-7-4.  159pp.  £5.50.  (Write Shamoon Zamir at
shamoon.zamir@kcl.ac.uk)

Griffiths is an extremely prolific author, & I'm often a little overwhelmed
by this; _The Ushabtis_ seems to me one of the most interesting recent books
of his.  In the blurb he calls it a "series or collection of poems" &
despite the recurrent image of the title (ushabtis are "small modeled clay
figures found in Egyptian tombs as servants to great individuals promoted to
immortal status in the otherworld.  As such they signify any homogenous
group, confident of its identity and immediate context, but necessarily
uncertain of its purpose/future."--the blurb again) this is probably best
treated as a set of quite varied poems, which range over political, personal
& historic matters with Griffiths' characteristic verve (there are few
authors with such an immediately energizing style: it moves crabwise down
the page, drawing on dialect, coinages, archaisms, tags from Latin or from
prose texts).  Here's a poem, #57, that's slightly untypical of the sequence
in its more continuous & settled surface:

As we walk
as we long along
chain of crags
around
ground limestone it's a gorge...
we walk in white and stain
sun in heat on rock texture and with shade
as tho we too once
we two with flint and hand-gold
fossils of ourselves
walked
as we long along
sun-dark ground-bright path
trodden, our way on
onto same-time places
proud of crags as we go
silent,
but still apes.
Sheltered and heeding viaducts, overhangs
'part from rain,
sidings,
fires that show away leopards,
dark night clutched together crowd
darks of crags around
down fire-gone, more
chalk in bright grain
dungy seats on rock backs at night fade
as tho we too once
we two with guide and film
mark the singer-seeds
connote with logic and tallying absences
what is the move/slope of--
what was
as we were (what song)
chain of tags and clutes
sound on walk on bed-pebble
age echo


Trevor Joyce, _with the first dream of fire they hunt the cold: a body of
work 66/00_.  Dublin: New Writers' Press; Cullompton: Shearsman Books, 2001.
0-907562-29-9.  £9.95; 16.45 euros.  243pp.  [This is available
through Peter Riley or SPD; it's also available from Shearsman
(www.shearsman.co.uk) & in Ireland via Wild Honey (www.wildhoneypress.com).]

One of the really important books to come out in the past year.  Joyce was
co-founder of New Writers' Press with Michael Smith, which was responsible
for publishing an impressive range of Irish and international modernist
poetries in the 1960s & 1970s.  Joyce himself wrote interesting
late-modernist poetry (notably _Pentahedron_, 1972) & most importantly a
"working" from the medieval Irish _Buile Suibhne_, entitled _The
Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine_ (1976)--it's not a "straight" translation but a
very fine radical revisioning of the text in a manner inspired by Pound &
(going back further) James Clarence Mangan.  & there it stood for a while,
as by his mid-20s Joyce had written himself into a writer's block that
lasted two decades virtually without interruption.  (One of the few poems
from during that block, "The Opening", from 1983, is an oblique love
poem, a poem about reading & writing, & I think also hints at the block &
the possibility of its dissolution, with the speaker addressing a "you" for
whom "these words" open up doors & holes to pass through, while the speaker
remains still inside in "silence", not crossing the threshold, watching
night fall outside the window.)  Astonishingly the majority of this book was
written in the span 1991-2000, with a truly heroic outpouring from the years
1997-2000: it's one of the most astonishing bursts of creativity I've
witnessed (having met Trevor in 1996 at the Romana Huk's Assembling
Alternatives Conference in New Hampshire, & stayed in touch since).  & it's
really this body of work which promotes Joyce to the status of a major
writer.  The texts are intricately worked out--sometimes using proceduralist
structures, as in _Syzygy_ or many of the short poems, sometimes using
collaged prose from multiple sources, as in _Trem Neul_ & _Hopeful
Monsters_--& even the more apparently conventional "well-made book" of poems
_stone floods_ is put together with attention to cross-links & thematic &
formal echoes.  (The author once showed me an informal commentary on the
book he wrote for Michael Smith, & it runs to 20pp of singlespaced
notes...!) -- I find it really hard to quote from this book, as so much of
its impact comes from larger patterns (for instance, in reading "Syzygy" one
first reads 12 "normal" lyrics, & then is confronted with a poem that
compresses the pulverized fragments of those lyrics into the space of three
pages; _Trem Neul_ is written as two parallel texts, one prose & one verse,
which only interact very obliquely).  Here's one poem from _stone floods_:

OWNING

What bird was that obliterated
with its heavy wing the sun?

A legion of dust force marched
across the solitary wind
invades me

I could have spoken
with the narrow bone of your forearm
but I neglectful slept
just slept through grains and aeons
hand foot yard chain seconds seasons terms

Why do vain dust and the darkened bone
wrestle still for their place by the wall?

When the white stone flutters
in the intense heat
the river purrs in its night apart

I might have ravelled knotted time
out of your hair that goes on growing
into the night and hurts at dawn

I might have brought you water
to wash clear the blood from your lengthening nails
but I watched the high crop thorned with frost
quick courses clot locks close
on those whose property
is to be possessed at last


& here's one of the component paragraphs of _Trem Neul_'s lefthand column:

You grow old through surfeit of division; irresistible winds in your veins
rock and bring down awkwardly.  I, I think that's what deters us all is the
loss of, of, of ability.  You fall prone to error: a vertigo that strikes
stillness cruelly.  It's terrifying.  Nobody wants to, to go through that,
nobody wants to experience too much.  When the biology of your body breaks
down, the skin has to be cut so as to give access to the inside.  Later it
has to be sewn back like memory, when it may house all knowledge.  Memory is
our comfort and our attire.  Fashioned with our hands it is the
accomplishment of our dreams and lapses; always a meaningful pattern though
never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of sub-patterns.  Pretend I'm lost
and try to find me.


Geraldine Monk, _Noctivagations_.  Nether Edge: West House, 2001.
0-9531509-9-2.  119pp.  [Write the publisher at alan@nethedge.demon.co.uk;
there's a limited number of copies of the CD _Angel High Wires_ available
also via the same source: it has Martin Archer's setting of "Songings" from
this book.]

This collects Monk's work of the last few years, none of it before in book
form.  Monk's profile has long deserved to be higher; I was surprised &
delighted to discover that in his chapter on contemporary British poetry in
_Fishing by Obstinate Isles_ (1998) Keith Tuma discusses her work at length,
a choice that I think is very prescient.  She's had a few previous
full-length collections--_Interregnum_ (1994), a book centred on a 1612
witch trial in East Lancashire, & _Walks in a Daisy Chain_ (1991), a book
that seems oddly little-known, a linked series of poems about professional
lives--but the earlier work is mostly hard to get (the strangely stingy
selected poems volume _The Sway of Precious Demons_ isn't much help--it's
about 40pp!).  Anyway, this is all to say: this is an enormously welcome
book by an author I greatly admire, whose writing has a whirling energy &
staccato rhythm with a tone ranging from the lyrical to the satiric to the
gothic.  I can think of a few pertinent UK authors--Bill Griffiths, Maggie
O'Sullivan, Barry MacSweeney--& know that Geraldine's an admirer of earlier
authors like Stein & Sitwell, but that's only useful to give a few bearings:
this is very distinctive stuff.  Here's the opening paragraph of
"Epicentre", first of three "Short Sorties" (not "Stories", as I'd initially
read the title!):

Darkness hit Paris flat at the flick of a switch.  She drew a blind across a
lycanthropic moon.  Suggestively detectable.  A hu-manish shape adjusts its
ears.  A stab in the dark goes wildly off-course.  Bad direction.  B Movie.
Falters.  Stumbles.  Makes way down close and dreaky East End alley.  Cat
rubbing up against her leg.  Persian carpets.  By design.  Darkness is a
kind kind of relief.  Mercy-mother-ma.  It has been a longlong day.  Not a
glitch of air.  A bauble.  Passionless evening of weepable proportions.
Month-upon-month of Sundays.  Without camber.  Tangents.  Not a hint of a
half of a turned up ha laugh.  He clicks on the gas tap.  The single gold
ring on his bony finger twists.  Catches light.  She strikes the match.  It
splits.  Rotten.  Slightly burning back hand.  His hand shakes.  To hold the
spoon steady needs a carafe of soothing.  To hold anything.  A sequence of
moments.  A sequin.  Broad spectrum miracle needed.  Strong-eyed medicine.
Mega-magic.

& here's a poem from "Songings":

Stoop rich fruit through nothingness
caress and be a steeper bliss.
Neon slips the storm.
Seizure of light.
Some fear to lose the day.
The lioness maymove
o'er her prey.

THIRD ANNUAL U.S.-CUBA WRITERS CONFERENCE
SCHEDULED FOR SPRING, 2002

Emerging writers from the United States and Cuba will have the unique
opportunity to participate in the Third Annual U.S.-Cuba Writers
Conference,
to be held in Havana, March 24-April 3, 2002. This extraordinary event -
the
only ongoing conference that brings together writers from the States and
Cuba
- will include intensive sessions with distinguished writers, and will =
take
place on the grounds of the prestigious international cultural center, =
Casa
de las Am=E9ricas.

More than forty participants from each country will take part in daily
workshops as well as mesas redondas on Cuban literature, its history and
social context. Extracurricular events will include visits to literary
landmarks around Havana as well as trips to baseball games, the beach, and =

other focal points of Cuban culture.

The 2002 Writers of the Americas faculty includes the following literary
standouts:
* Mayra Montero (fiction; author of In the Palm of Darkness) * Rub=E9n
Mart=EDnez
(non-fiction; author of Crossing Over: A Mexican Family on the Migrant
Trail)
* Jack Ag=FCeros (poetry; author of Sonnets From the Puerto Rican) * =
Carlos
Morton (playwriting; author of The Many Deaths of Danny Rosales) * Joe
Hayes
(story-telling; author of numerous bilingual children's books).* Suzanne
Jill
Levine (translation; has translated Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Manuel =
Puig,
and other major modern Latin American authors) and * Danny Hoch (writing
for
performance; his monologues include Jails, Hospitals, Hip-Hop).

WTA will provide its writers with a U.S. license to travel to Cuba legally =

for the workshop and seminars.

Conference co-directors are Tom Miller, author of many books about Latin
America and the American Southwest, and Rebecca Crocker, a =
California-based
freelance writer and college instructor.

The WTA website, www.wtamericas.com, has full details of the program and
its
application procedure, faculty biographies, and writing sample =
requirements
for each genre. Because our selection procedure is competitive and our
previous U.S.-Cuba Writers Conferences have proven so enormously popular,
we

most
events will include Spanish, we encourage bilingual applicants.

______________________________________________
WEDNESDAY JANUARY 16 at 8PM

CRAIG DWORKIN
"Against Meaning"


Introduced by Brian Stefans


In "Against Meaning", Craig Dworkin proposes a radically new way of
reading-one that proceeds without regard to theme or content or referential
meaning, and yet still retains the explanatory powers and pleasures we
associate with reading. With examples from both experimental and
conventional writing-from George Oppen and Guillaume Apollinaire to Robert
Frost and Elizabeth Bishop-this talk will illustrate what we might call an
'applied paragrammatics': how to engage texts on their own terms while
sidestepping the familiar lull of their normative grammars. Craig Dworkin is
a writer and professor at Princeton University. He has recently published in
October and Sagetrieb, and "Reading the Illegible", a critical study of
artistic appropriation and misuse is forthcoming from Northwestern
University Press.

writer David Matlin
visual artist Chris Morrey

Saturday, January 19, 7 pm, Dinnerware Gallery, 135 East Congress
Admission: $5; Students $3

David Matlin is a novelist, poet, and essayist. His collections of poetry
and prose include the books China Beach, Dressed In Protective Fashion, and
Fontana's Mirror. How the Night is Divided, Matlin's first novel, was
nominated for a National Book Circle Critics Award.  His newest book,
Vernooykill Creek: The Crisis of Prisons in America, is based on his nearly
ten year experience teaching in one of the oldest Prison Education Programs
in the nation in New York State. This extended essay is a discussion of the
crisis of prisons, the invention of surplus populations, and how, in making
prison our largest growth industry, we are mining our own civil
disintegrations at an unprecedented level.  Matlin received his Ph.D. from
the State University of New York at Buffalo where he studied with Robert
Creeley, John Clarke, and Angus Fletcher. He lives in San Diego.

hi
this sounds like a great event
just a question that might be obvious for the majority of the subscribers
of this mailing list but not so obvious for such
a person like me, actually an 'alien' in the u.s
in which city will the event take place?

'alien': tinny world that sometimes comes next to a  square box that some
people  have to check whenever filling papers for u.s- immigration
services, among other meanings

yours

Thomas. I saw that link. I dont think that that poet (I dont know her) or
the NY Times is a malevolent (person) organisation. Any more than in New
Zealand the NZ Herald - well that paper is fairly conservative and in the
old days NZ was so..I dont know there seemed to be direct links between
local capitalists or what we used to call "the establishment" who even if
they wernt actually in any "conspiracy" sertainly were very conservative:
nowadays the NZ Listener is a bit more "liberal" and then there are left
wing neswpapers which give some enlightenment (albeit they too have their
rhetorics)(Scott Hamilton will kno about those and there's obviously
equivalents in the US): but the implication is always away from the
innovative or the challenging in the major mags: that said there are and
were some good things in the NY Times ( interesting things that show "the
other side" which is a healthy sign and one of the (good) paradoxes of the
US (West - I'm not just targetting the US here)and eg The Guardian: but a
reader needs to know something of history and political mechanisms. Certain
elements of the working class have an experiential and instinctual
understanding of the way class struggle and other struggles withins society)
enact: but there's a tendency in humans (of whatever ilk or class) to
simplify: generalise...which is a neccessary evil. So there's the various
rhetorics: but there's hardly any non-political or "innocent" writing: of
course there are areas of human experience (I think the term is Limnal:?)
which are universal, or seem so...) the kind of therapy that the poet talks
about is good..I can understand people who were near to S11 or had relatives
or friends or who are just very sensitive deeply needing that kind of
"therapy": but if its any comfort you can bet there are now a lot of people
in Afghanistan who will be if not killed or mutilated or burnt alive by US
bombs will be traumatised...now most if not all of those people had nothing
to do with the attack on the US...but anyway, instead of the 6000 or so dead
from S11 you now have as many who are now traumatised and maybe dead: so two
wrongs are thus making a right: or many wrongs....
  But for people who are still "intact" so to speak the kind of poetry such
as Herbert and Sharon Olds, well ok its all very well, but dark reality
carries on! And quoting Celan! He was driven mad by an anti-semitism that
culminated after hundreds of years of anti-semitism. His was a dark,
involute, constricted but beautiful posion of blackness and blood. All or
nothing for Celan. (Like many western nations the US ("Land of the Free")
refused to take many Jews even when they knew they were in for the chop:
read "The Burning Bush" by Barnet Litvinoff) If people want to "hate" John
Walker (unlike Pound, Walker is  or was a soldier, for better or worse) and
put him away for life (or that happens as others bury their heads in "soft"
poetry") then why didnt the British and the Americans imprison the entire
Wehrmacht after the 2nd WW:: or better still about 90% of the German
population who supported Hitler: and Hitler was truly "evil" whereas the
Taleban's "evil" is that they refused to let the US or Russian military
dominate their land and had a "strange" or "alien" culture? Why are they not
even treated as war  prisoners? Why are they just off Cuba? When did
Afghanistan declare war against the US? Why didnt the British bomb Southern
Ireland? Israel: nothings improved over there...its probably worse...Libya -
what's happenned to that hot house? Iraq? Iran? Russia? (The place is
seething with crime and murders!) South America eg Brazil where eg gangs
just assasinated Sir Peter Blake the NZ-Brit yachtsman? The US military and
Blair etal have stopped terrorism? So a guy with a bomb on his shoe tries to
light it in full view of every one in the plane? A young man crashes into a
bulding? Oh: you'll have to bomb the hell out of Iran now..maybe then the
terrorists (communists or liberals or arabs: whatever...people who dont like
"democracy" and McDonalds and being "free:)... They ARE the terrorists!!
   But people like that wet poet in the NY Times wouldnt know if you put a
daisy cutter up their (her) rectal region...Anyway: we as poets have to talk
straight even if its hearty rhetoric: if we're are wrong lets at least
debate and care and let loose, but save us for the bowls of Christ!... not
go out with a whimper or the shadowed possible of a sob..."let our poetry be
rich, hateful, longing, loving,burnng, and alive..".   Richard.

Did any New York listserv folk attend Craig Dworkin's talk "against
meaning" last night? If you did, please report. He's a smart cookie
and I'd like to get a gist of what he's "for."

New from O Books: MUSIC OR FORGETTING by E. Tracy Grinnell ($12.00), =
Small Press Distribution: 1341 Seventh St., Berkeley CA 94710.
The poems are diachronic cartography: "As in the title, a single line =
may be her memory and conjecture BEING the same space and time AT only =
'the present time of the poem.' Or, her memory and conjecture are the =
same, cumulatively absorbed, as if there is no speaker or seer in a long =
quiet present, which becomes its music: 'historically/ waves are either =
synchronic,/spatial,or/new presence of body presupposes dialogue.'" -- =
Leslie Scalapino
"The language intimates aspects of drawing, mobile, etude in which =
color, space, detail are sparingly applied...The poetry obtains a =
distillation..." -- C.D. Wright

Dear Poetics,
I'm wondering what list members think about the
treatment of these prisoners ?
Here's a very brief article from Sydney's daily
newspaper.

in response to the query about various mla panels:
the most significant thing for me at these events was to see, that is,
actually lay eyes on, friends and colleagues whom i hadn't seen since
before 9-11, especially those from nyc like lee ann brown, charles
bernstein, eileen myles...  to see them and to see that they were okay and
carrying on makes it easier to do so oneself.

eliot?  a young actor friend, very smart but unable because of his career
to take regular college classes but who is trying to educate himself, wants
to know.  i do too, since i've agreed to discuss "The Wasteland" with him
at some point in the future.

American literature primarily from the first half of the twentieth century.
Papers may examine either ethnic writers whose works can be considered

address ethnicity within their works. Possible topics investigating the
roles of ethnicity and modernism may include (but are not limited to):
identity formation; language; literary style; immigration; politics;
assimilation; the idea of "breaking from the past"; disillusionment; any
historical and cultural perspectives addressing ethnic and modernist issues
from the period.

Please submit an abstract and brief vita by March 15, 2002. E-mail
submissions accepted.  Panelists must be members of the MLA by April 1,

Pam,

It sucks, obviously.

Calling these people "unlawful combatants" is as creative as the
Rumsfeld-Ashcroft set gets. Yes, such combatants have fewer rights under the
Geneva Convention than do POWs, but that is because there is NO such
category under the convention -- these are POWs, pure and simple.

What never gets said clearly, though it is obviously behind what thinking
the Bushies do is that normally after a conflict POWs go home, tend their
fields, raise families, turn into Joseph Beuys if they're lucky, etc. But
the concern here is that these folks won't stop fighting just because
someone declares the war over.

In a sense, this parallels the current penal trend to keep sex criminals in
the US in custody past the completion of their terms on the grounds that
they continue to be dangerous. It's a status offense, rather than one
committed. All status offenses (beginning with the classic "juvenile
delinquent") are really crimes of the mind -- if you knew what X (or Y) was
thinking, you'd lock them up.

This is par for the Bush regime. One of the conundra that progressives have
been faced with in the past 4+ months in the US is what to do with real
enemies when one's own elected officials are so utterly hopeless. Having an
administration that got into power by extra-constitutional means has
literally meant that said regime has shown precious little regard for the
constitution once it got into power. [Thanks yet again, Ralph Nader.]  And
would you trust a court system that has, at its pinnacle, the likes of
Scalia or Thomas?

These are dangerous times,

Ron Silliman
(whose ancestor, Sir John Franklin, was not exactly one of the progressives
of Australian history....)


"Dear Poetics,
I'm wondering what list members think about the
treatment of these prisoners ?

wasn't intending to attribute malevolence, just wanting to indicate my
poetic response did not run to lullabies and i would guess that applies to
others?

yo, all, i've been reading norman finkelstein's and steve fredman's newish
books on jewish american poetry w/ special reference to the objectivists.
i'm beginning to see the logic of the designator "objectivist" and the
specificity of style, but can someone spell out for me how zukovsky's
insistence on a poem as a "rested totality" and the concept of the object
as bearer of meaning are different from, respectively, the notion of the
lyric poem as an autonomous "whole" and eliot's "objective correlative"?
that is, i can see how the *poetry* is different, but i'm not sure how the
*poetics* are different, from what has become normative.  forgive the
flatfootedness of the question, but i've been slow to approach the
"objectivists" --i've said before on this list that the word "objectivists"
immediately made me feel as if i wouldn't be smart enough to understand
them -- and i'd appreciate a lucid and precise explanation.

I'm guessing that other contributors to the _Fitzroy Dearborn Encyclopedia
of American Poetry: The 20th Century_ are here on the list.  I'm
wondering--have any of you been paid yet?  I received my copy of the book in
June or July.  Sometime in November I realized I'd never been paid.  I
called, left messages, and got a call telling me that contributors would be
paid shortly after Jan 1.  I called today and was told that now there's no
date in sight.  "Cash crunch."

Please backchannel if you'd prefer not to discuss this on the list.

    Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS:  Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless...  Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
 Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous,
provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological...  Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
entertaining, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring...

Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em, trade
`em, print `em, even publish them...

twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of

worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the

Eliot hated the idea of biographies.

To make a statement like ' Peter Ackroyd's is an excellent start.' is to,
wittingly or unwittingly, subscribe to a lie. You, I, or anyone else, cannot
know what was the reality of Eliot's life to Eliot, even any more than we
can of Mrs Mopbucket the part-time cleaner who lives in the flat downstairs
or Mr Fuckem, the great broker, or anyone else with the partial exception of
those very few people we know with a degree of the intimacy that we know
ourselves. Which knowing of oneself mostly consists of forgettings.

Anyone up for a Shakespeare biography?

Pam ,
thanks for re-politicizing this list.

i think that the personal responses after 9/11 were  amazing for those of
us outside  that orbit of DC or NYC.

I had a poem broadcast on the CBC where i referred to this list.

I had at a guy from the National Post  (canada's rightist national?) onthe
rails at a public forum about corperate media at my school. i guess his
family has lots o' $$.

this is pertinant too.

bests,
kevin

Spare our blushes and put a sack on it
By Terry Jones


I was thrilled to see a photo in the New York Times last week
showing US troops guarding prisoners suspected of belonging to
al-Qaeda in Shibarghan, Afghanistan. The story that accompanied
the picture described how the 101st Airborne Division had been
ordered to relieve the Marine Corps in southern Afghanistan,
paving the way for a long-term military presence in the country.
The photo also appeared in the Times here, but neither paper
mentioned the part of the photo that got me so excited as
President of the Humane Society for Putting Bags Over Suspects'
Heads. The photograph clearly showed that the prisoners
suspected of belonging to al-Qaeda had their arms pinioned
behind them and had bags over their heads, secured with metallic
tape. We in HSPBOSH have been trying for years to get more
armies to put bags over the heads of anyone they suspect of
anything. For one thing, the placing of a bag over the heads of
suspects protects those of us who are not involved from
unpleasant feelings of sympathy for the prisoners. There is
nothing more offensive to ordinary, law-abiding
newspaper-readers than seeing rows of sorry-looking peasants
being herded into the backs of cattle-trucks by our lads in the
Army. The prisoners often looked frightened, dejected and
hungry, and how can anyone eat a decent full breakfast over
photos like that?

Once a bag has been placed over their heads, however, it is
impossible to feel much for them. They cease to be human-beings
and as such make no unreasonable call upon our emotions. The
placing of a bag over the suspects' head also has another highly
desirable effect: it makes them all look guilty. One cannot see
a man with a bag over his head without feeling that he must have
deserved it, and that anything he has got coming to him is only
what he ought to expect.

The same probably goes for the person with the bag over their
head. I've never had it done to me personally, but I believe the
effect is very disorientating. A prisoner with the bag over his
head ceases to feel human as well as look it, and deprivation of
sight, smell and balance encourages him expect the worst.

And this, of course, brings us to the economic argument for
putting heads in bags. Once a suspect has been trussed-up, had
the bag placed over their head, and been driven around in the
back of a cattle truck for a bit, they'll usually confess to
anything. This saves a lot of time, effort and - most
importantly - money in trying to sort out terrorists from
ordinary blokes whom the Army has rounded up because they had
unpleasant beards and bad haircuts.

This is one of the reasons why the British Government was so
keen on putting bags over the heads of IRA suspects in the early
1970s. It was very economically effective. Of course those
spoilsports at the European Court of Human Rights put a spanner
in the works in 1978 when they outlawed the technique, claiming
that it 'amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading
treatment'. In other words they said it was a form of torture.

Luckily the US is not bound by any soft-centred decisions of the
European Court of Human Rights. In fact the US also needn't take
any notice of the United Nations Convention against Torture
either, because it was one of the few countries that had the
sense not to sign the agreement in 1985. Argentina, Belgium,
Bolivia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland,
France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Senegal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay made the mistake
of signing it, and subsequently Venezuela, Luxembourg, Panama,
Austria and even the UK and Afghanistan joined in, but America
didn't.

Lucky for them. Now we can see how it's paying off. The US Army
can put bags over the heads of whoever they like. But what
really excited us at HSPBOSH was the fact that the editors of
the New York Times and the London Times could publish the
photograph of Afghanistani suspects with bags over their heads
without making any comment at all.

Let's hope this means that the British and American public is
finally ready to accept the fact that the only faces that matter
are British and American faces. These are the only 'people' who
count now, and - to be quite honest - the rest of the world
might has well go around with bags over their heads. Which is
great news for all of us here at HSPBOSH.

To go a step further, if there's no declared war they're not POWs. If
they're suspected of complicity in a US crime (the trade center, for
instance), if extradited to the US they can be held in a federal prison and
tried in federal civilian court. Military jurisdiction seems a stretch.

A friiend suggested to me that they're being held in Guantanamo because US
civilian law doesn't apply there. I have no idea if this is so, but I doubt
it: I thought that US law applies in leased territories. I wouldn't mind
being enlightened. Ron, do you know?

My fantasy, because I try, against all logic, to figure out the rationale
for absurd behaviors, is that Bush and Co. plan to punish the prisoners by
releasing them in Havana, probably the sexiest place on earth, and watching
them implode.

Unfortunately, Ron, you and other 'progressives' who
supported the invasion of Afghanistan are partly
responsible for the creeping fascism that is reflected
in the treatment of prisoners inside and outside of
America.

The 'War Against Terror' was supposed to make the
world a safer place, but it has only led to the
smashing of civil liberties in the First and Third
World, the intensification of the Zionist onslaught in
Palestine, a nuclear standoff between US-backed India
and new bogeyman-in-the-making Musharaff, the
institution of a UN-backed programme of
starvation-through-sanctions ala Iraq in Somalia,
imperialist adventures in Yemen and now the Philipines
and, last but not least, a belliose and bullying
American response to the great anti-capitalist
rebellion in Argentina which is likely to turn into
military intervention in the event of a successful
revolution.

Events have exposed in the most dramatic fashion the
moral and intellectual bankruptcy of 'progressives'
who supported imperialist war as a route to a more
peaceful world.

Cheers
Scott

Dear Poetics and Pam. Its terrible: the American military have taken
prisoners of war...if they suspect "war crimes (eg a conection with S11)
that should be dealt with by the United Nations. I can understand the anger
of Americans but the Taleban are basically smashed now as is Afganistan. The
wjole world needs to look into the real causes of S11. This taking of
prisoners: they have to e either 1) war criminals 2) prisoners of war (when
they should be quickly released 3) "traitors" which it will be hard to find
because Afghanistan didnt declare war or make any attempt to attack the US
in any way 4) if they are simply "special prisoners" they still have the
right of habeues corpus.
  People cant get diverted into "but they wouldnt treat US prisoners half as
well" that's a weak argument.
 Its terrible.
 Also the Australian Government's handling of immigrants whether they are
illegal or not: they are still human. Also New Zealand and my own country's
weak support of the attack by the US on the sovereignity of Afghanistan:
hence their implied support of this new US inhumanity: I'm not talking about
the US people per se but we are all  involved (in this) in the West. Not to
say that S11 was not a terrible event: of course it was. But the US response
(and other Western Nations) was wrong: very wrong.
  We cannot  continue the cycle of oppression and violation and violence and
war: the US (military etc) needs to pull out of ALL foreign nations in any
other than a truly humanitarian support role and or to assist other poorer
nations to grow.They need to stop bullying: they wont miss out on any
produce or oil.... Prove how human they are and "chrtistain?" they are by
showing love? Dare we say love?
  I dont think that terrorism would exist if the pressures of US occupation
and Israeli aggression wee ended.
  In defence of Israel: they captured Eichmann and at least gave him a fair
trial and treated him very well. Eichmann was a monster on a big big scale:
but these guys are at best "freedom fighters" at worst "wrong-headed "
idealists: obviously some of them are going to be "extremists"...you become
one when your country is bombed and betrayed.
  But the US needs these men to be handled by the US Justice System: not
closed military tribunals etc - or preferably an International justice
system...most will be probably found to be combatents defending their birth
or adopted country: ok some may be seen as "terrorists"...but I doubt if any
had anything to do with the attack on the US on Sept 11 2001. Richard
Taylor.

Thanks Ron,
I knew you'd say it sucks. And, of course, I agree.
I guess I wanted to open the topic as it's so worrying
to see human rights being ignored so flagrantly in so
many places & situations currently.
You say "This is par for the Bush regime. One of the
conundra that progressives
have
been faced with in the past 4+ months in the US is
what to do with real
enemies when one's own elected officials are so
utterly hopeless.
Having an
administration that got into power by
extra-constitutional means has
literally meant that said regime has shown precious
little regard for
the
constitution once it got into power."
We have a government in Australia that was elected on
fear & division in relation to refugees - right now,
this country has more refugees "in detention" than any
other.Two days ago 58 of the "detainees" in the desert
"detention centre" (euphemism for "prison") at Woomera
(which is an old rocket testing/launching facility)
physically sewed their lips up & went on hunger strike
in protest at the delay in their refugee-status
applications being processed.
I can only report this.

And, was that Sir John Franklin who sailed with
Matthew Flinders ? I think his problem when he became
governor  of Tasmania was that he inherited Arthur's
severely punitive penal system & was too much of a
wimp to change it.

Thanks again,
Pam

AND under the Geneva convention, if there is some question as to whether or not
a captive is to be classified as a POW, the decision is to be made by a board
carefully defined under the accords, not by the chief executive of one of the
warring parties -- The Bush administration, which always portrayed itself as a
great friend to the average GI, seems remarkably untroubled by the precedent
this sets -- I think we know what to expect, after this, when one of our
"advisors" gets grabbed in the Phillipines, Singapore or elsewhere --

Maria. I'm ust looking at Zukovsky and have been reading Mark Scroggins's
book on LZ. Also having anoher look at "A" and I want to study "80 Flowers "
closely... but I'm no expert on LZ or the so-called "objectivists":

 But lets look 1) The poem as a "rested totality". This phrase is or sounds
rather "gaseous"  (Zukovsky's term - acoording to Mark Scroggins - for
language that has departed from  the truth of seeing=knowing [ not knowledeg
per se ..it'll be seen that I'm only up to chapter 3 of M.S.'s book!] ).
That said: how do you define the term? I'll stab: you (he she it they) mean
that the poem is an integral whole but "rested" indirectly implies (or may
do) that this state is paradoxically dynamic: objective as the poem is it
contnues to work, to interact with the reader or the reader with it. But if
this is meant literally  ( I mean that it is  "rested") it sounds as though
the poem eg one of LZs flower poems such as Leggott quotes eg Zinnia,
Livefoever etc is stopped, dead: but knowing LZ's knowledge and interest in
space and physics one body resting is oposed by another in dynamic motion:
and no body (in any sense of that word) is in itself non-motile,static,
dead: the sun, the human body (even when dead it is "alive " in a
sense)...Now I the lyric poem as an objective whole is always problematic as
well as the notion of  "rested totality"  ("wrested totality"? totality
being everything or it being just one thing?) If everything (or
approaching ) then it is a dynamic and changing thing (internally in
itself).  One could see the lyric poem as an objective thing apart from the
writer, but compare it to the birth of a child: the child is "objective" in
relation to the mother (or parent(s)) but has qualities and influences of
the parent and continues to interact and grow: as theoretically LZ's flower
poems (and the flowers in them) would (if they seeded and were fortunate as
life often is) take root and grow. Objective in that cursorily and at
certain "reading levels" LZ and his family('s) emotions  etc etc are not in
the poem but by (admitedly by knowing about LZ through various exegeses and
his BNPs in Texas (that fact is a worry)). But we know that the poems direct
us to their words but behind the words is/are the people in the writer's
life.
  Cross to 2) the concept of the object as bearer of meaning. It does seem
close to Eliot's concept:  and/but  it is true that the poetry is very
different. Eliot uses the concentrated image but "wanders" (perhaps more
frequently) than LZ or even Pound into "abstractions"( his interest in Dante
although Dante has a place at the beginning of "A") (if we can leave aside
the problem of what is abstract and what is concrete - or if and when and
whether concrete is abstract and v/v): but the yellow smoke in Prufrock is
obvious in its power as an energising metaphorical or objective correlative
musch as the smog in Bleak house is literally for the befogment and miasma
and corruption of legal London. (And hence paradoxically a negative force as
is the ether: (or is it?) an apparently enervating experience... Eliot
solidifies his miasma into "concrete" moulds; but Eliot wants to talk to us
and convey his deep religiosity and sense of vision in The Waste Land he
looks into the "heart of light, the silence" whereas Zukovsky has as
possibly an equivalent epiphany: "blue blown up against yellow" .. bu there
are paradoxical parallels between the poets..and indeed I suspect in the
totality of his "music" as Bach does ...
  Here I start to get out of my depth and would call on the "big guns" such
as..well  any number of "Listers" possibly Michele Leggott herself...others,
other Zukofskiologists...
 The poetics is different but in both poets the poetic is relatively unclear
and more their own life-philosophies: their approach their way a way of
living. Eliot obtained some love and happiness (his "recognition" didnt hepl
him much) and LZ altho a bit bitter always had family love and proably a
'beter" (define better!) life overall than Eliot. Happier overall probably.
 Certainly that kind of beautiful but astringent lyric acheived in "80
Flowers" by a greater formal discipline that Eliot acheived (I feel) I think
is part of the greatnesss of LZ and the fascination and challenge of his
poetry as a model or inspiration.
 Also the idea of a person actually growing the things to be studied
and -made- into poems is quite alien to Eliot. Eliot is more of a visionary,
if ironic somewhat after Lafourge.... Also the notion I think of such a
"non-spontaneous" project: Eliot was more of  a (Cahrlie Parker or Miles
Davis or at least a Mozart!!) Zukovsky was more - I say more -  Bachish,
brackish, and humanish? I retyre at this point...Richard Taylor.
   Some tentative reponses.

Maria:

I just happened to be reading Bruce Elder's book on the films of Stan Brakhage
and the traditions of Pound, Stein and Olson when your question came across my
screen -- This passage may make a start towards your answer:

Where Williams' use of the particular object differs from Eliot's is that Williams' method does not convert the object into an objective correlative, i.e., a
vehicle for conveying the artist's subjectivity, nor does his compositional
process reduce it to a metaphor, or a symbol of some sort, of inwardness.  The
particular object remains autonomous, independent of, and indifferent to the
feelings that its qualities suggest.  It is, paradoxically, as utterly
objective that these "correlatives" call upon subjectivity, and reveal its
characteristics. (p 165)


and that, I think it's clear, suggests why Williams was a natural ally of the
Objectivists --

Subject:      Celebratory Fence Books Deal
Comments: To: ira@angel.net
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello and happy end of January.

Recently our two first Fence Books poetry titles have received some
not-bad-at-all reviews. As a celebratory gesture we're offering a special
deal: Buy both books and get a big discount. Instead of $24 plus $4
shipping and handling, you can pay $18 plus $2 shipping and handling.
That's a discount of . . . 30%?

Just go here: http://www.fencebooks.com and click on the special deal
button. Or you can send a check for $20 to Fence Books/Special Deal, 14
Fifth Avenue, #1A, NY NY  10011.

And here's the Village Voice, lengthily, on Zirconia, by Chelsey Minnis (we
guarantee that you will delight in the flimsiness and superficiality
mentioned in the review's final paragraph):

"Gem Trails

"I exist in a blister of fantasy," proclaims the narrator of this
self-assured and often deeply satisfying debut. Similar in form, style, and
rhetorical strategy, each of the poems in Zirconia is, in essence, an
associative riff on a particular object (a tiger lily, a skull ring, the
moon), or in some cases, a state of mind (grief, confusion, ecstasy).
Minnis's sharp-tongued, sexy, and somewhat juvenile narrator uses these
obsessive, fetishistic examinations to both describe and insert the reader
into a dream state-a kind of mythic consciousness, in which memory and
desire transform the stuff of everyday life into charged symbols of, well,
memory and desire. In "Sectional," the narrator "sink[s] into a reverie in
leather," while chewing on a piece of caramel and "reliving/a moment and
revolving." The poem spans her moment on the couch, chewing the candy,
touching the leather, and attempting to "evaluate/the reverie/in the
enormous moments."

Clearly designed to be read consecutively, the poems fit together like a
puzzle, forming an abstract portrait of the narrator, a trickster who
swerves from sophisticated observation ("you/perhaps/want to be torn in
half/rather than endure/the hurt/of desire") to blank recitation
("supervermilion/infrared/warpath/bloodlines"), from ironic humor suitable
to McSweeney's ("I am very excited about the skull ring") to overwrought
sentimentality ("and you want to grind your sorrows/into it"), and from
high poetic diction ("which indicates a conscience ensconced") to banal
conversational prose ("One Sunday, my parents discovered the Bridal Barbie
I had hidden in the freezer. . . . ").

Though Minnis's narrative voice-half-smirking, half-weeping-lends Zirconia
much of its appeal, the poet's most striking (and daring) move is a
stylistic one. All but three of the poems are composed in a fragmented
manner, using periods to eat up the white space of the page (in the quotes
above, slashes stand in for wide fields of periods), like this, from
"Maroon":

...........sleepy and strong...........................................
.....................with matted fur and saline..................

When it works, the effect is brilliant. The typographic dots guide the eye
through the individual poems, furthering the dream-state effect by slowing
down the reader as words swim out from periods, their meanings accentuated.
But it doesn't always work. In flimsy poems like "Sunburns" and
"Supervermilion," the periods come off as a lazy way of injecting depth
into otherwise superficial pieces."

by Joanna Smith Rakoff

***

And here's Publishers Weekly, briefly, on Miss America, by Catherine
Wagner. Note the mysterious, encoded reference to Deborah Garrison!:

"In serial sets of Fractional Anthems and Magazine Poems, Wagner lights out
for the territory of layered lexical eroticism pioneered by Lee Ann Brown.
Yet she infuses her lines with a sardonic and foreboding edge, as in the
second of Two Poems for Entertainment Weekly: Friendly and forsaken/ Is it
hotter to wear a bra/ Or let my boobs stck to my chest/ Melanin, melatonin,
metonym, melanoma. For the 'pimply and shiny' generation ten or so years
younger than Deborah Garrison's Working Girl, this book, one of the first
from Fence magazine's new publishing arm, will strike definitive chords."

yes, it is.  one of the things I'm finding out through the internet is that
this may be a US phenomenon as other countries do seem to have journal and
bookoutlets that are economically viable and don't let themselves get boxed
into the US traps, like academic, in, feminist, langpo, beat, Christian,
etc.  It might be a useful exercise to develop a list of examples of likes?

I like what I've seen from Wild Honey, for example.

enormous organisms, ephemeral, copper-wire, fiber-optic, satellites:
antennas all
the organisms are invisible but they respond to the coherency of network
communications
they sense intelligence running through the wires, they are themselves
intelligent, they are among us
what to do, they think, what to do, what to do
they bumble, banging into packets and datagrams, they don't understand
digital protocols and programs
it's as if they're amputated, as if they're blinded, in the middle of
human artifacts, human designs
they're sentient, they can't read the codes, they have so much to tell us,
they're silenced by zeros and ones
they don't understand the vast landscape of binaries, they have no feeling
for addresses, they murmur softly to one another
their understanding is beyond our comprehension, their knowledge
unsurpassed, our coding is our own, their coding is their own
the wires are humming, as if carrying sensibility multiplexing beyond our
wildest imaginations
organisms of such intelligence, bridge the great divide, please, we beg
you, come to us come to us

by virtue of the indent, language becomes stuff
 it sits there, gnawing at the margin, as if something else were going
 on. it continues in this fashion - there was a pressure applied, a
 sliding effect
  no such thing exists in any form whatsoever. someone thinks: it's a
  conscious choice, the words were put there, they were arranged in
  such-and-such a fashion
  in reality it could be anything at all. but it gnaws, slips, slides
  forward, just about to topple, this substance of language, this
  phonemics which sticks in the throat,
   the most vulnerable part of the body. there is no stopping speech, nor
   syntax, once language moves from protolanguage, protosyntax, to this
   incipient point,
   then back again, as now. a conjuration 'in print' of language's
   foreignness, its other of any other. as if we're faced of a sudden,
   faced of a night, with this determinative
   (indicated by a push
   (indicating by a toppling, or what appears to be an arrangement
    perhaps a contract made by someone or something)
    perhaps the very nature of a contract itself)

BLAISE PASCAL EATING A LEMON IN THE COMPANY OF ALEXADRE DUMAS AND RALPH
WALDO EMERSON ON A VERY HOT DAY


DUMAS: Sour, eh?

PASCAL: 'Sour, eh?' Is that the best you can do?

EMERSON: Lay off, Blaise.

DUMAS: It's okay, Ralph, I can handle this.

EMERSON: Why is he always trying to up the ante somehow?

PASCAL: I'm sitting right here.

EMERSON: Okay then, Blaise -- my bitter friend, sitting on an empty milk
crate, looking angry -- why are you always showing people up?

PASCAL: I occasionally--

DUMAS: I said I could handle this, Ralph.

PASCAL: Or rather, sporadically notice how mundane my philosophical friends
have become. And my writer-friends, too. I mean, think about it, guys. We
walk out of the pub there, and Alex chirps, 'Sheesh, it's hot.' Now that's
what I call a mundane observation.

DUMAS: I'm sitting right here.

PASCAL: Okay, Al. I'll ask you straight. Why do you feel the need to narrate
life in all its ratty detail? It's not as if there's something to be
gained--

DUMAS: You ignore a basic principal of social life.

PASCAL: Yes?

DUMAS: Social people engage in simple commentary and inquiry in order to
hedge themselves in from the inevitable abyss, from death; their seemingly
trite or as you say 'mundane' observations form a kind of mortar between the
bricks of artful and philosophical statements. They are like sips of water
between shots of bourbon.

PASCAL: I never chase my bourbon.

DUMAS: Okay, but do you prefer your bricks stacked loose? See, I neither
seek to engage triviality nor do I shun it; unlike most people, though, I am
at least half-conscious of my small talk. I wouldn't see the harm if I
weren't, though. Much great thought has arisen from the seedbed of common
gaffs, street mentionings. Let your words-of-mouth meander, Blaise.

EMERSON: Well said, Alex.

PASCAL: I have to think about it. It seems unduly ornamental.

DUMAS: Not ornamental, Blaise. Basic to human nature. Come on.

EMERSON: Here comes Virginia Woolf.

DUMAS: I'm not afraid!

PASCAL: There you go again, Al.

EMERSON: [grinning broadly] Doh!

DUMAS: She's sweating like a pig. Look at all the dark spots on her sun
dress.

EMERSON: Well, it's a hot day. No rain in sight, either.

PASCAL: [dramatically exasperated] Come on guys.

WOOLF: Hey fellas. What's shakin'?

EMERSON & DUMAS: Nothin' but the leaves on the trees, sweetie pie!

[She smiles brightly.]

PASCAL: I am throwing up now. I am going to buy some smokes.

[He crosses street, throws lemon rind in trash can, enters shop.]

WOOLF: What's wrong with Blaise?

DUMAS: We finally cornered him on his ivory-tower attitude toward common
parlance. This has been a long time coming, but I think he'll rebound
quickly.

WOOLF: Interesting.

DUMAS: And while we're cornering people, what's with the hero complex,
Ralph? You're a nice guy, but I can stick up for myself in situations like
this.

EMERSON: Sorry, Alex. I leap at injustice. No offense intended. You're a
man, you can handle conflict.

WOOLF: Hey, hey now.

DUMAS: Yeah, what's with the sexist remarks?

EMERSON: Wow, a guy doesn't have to say much to give offense around here,
does he? Remember, I'm a nineteenth-century intellectual from a democratic
but imperialistic society. Although I am a humanist, my mores are based in
Christian values. I'm not trained to guard myself against sexist comments.
Mine is the age of science and industry; the strength of men is an important
part of that.

WOOLF: The strength of people, I would say.

EMERSON: Whatever.

DUMAS: That 'whatever' is the Achilles heel of your whole mentality, gentle
thinker. I may be a novelist, Virginia, but I seem to outwit these
mind-cowboys with dispatch.

[Pascal reappears with a small, old fashioned packet of cigarettes; crosses
the street to rejoin the group.]

PASCAL: Anyone want to head up to Marty's for a slice?

DUMAS: It's only 4:40, but I could eat. I think the heat has made me hungry.

[The others nod their consent and the whole group begins to walk.]

WOOLF: Do you guys want to hear an excerpt from my new bit? I'm calling it
'The Vagina Dialogues.'

DUMAS: Ewww!!

PASCAL: Why not monologues?

WOOLF: Working title! Fear not, fellas.

[The men huddle, whisper between themselves, and begin to chant 'Who's
afraid of Virginia Woolf?'; Woolf grins broadly and joins in, and arm-in-arm
they dance offstage.]

But when did we ever expect the USA to act according to any
international agreements on anything? They wont pay their UN fees.
They say to hell with environmental accords, even after they sign
them. They bomb the shit out of every smaller country they can find.
They topple elected governments and install unelected ones. Why would
anyone expect the USA to act according to any civil decency rules?

Quite true, Dave, though if it annoyed Eliot, then I, not a big reader of
biographies, will willingly turn into one, 'cause I love to annoy the
annoying mr. Eliot.
        Of course all biographies are "fictions" to some extent, just as all
autobiographies are. And yet Dave, as a young writer, were you not
interested in the actual lives of those writers you were reading & admiring?
Most of my students want to know something -- from a little to a lot -- of
the lives of the authors they like. & I don't think that is an illegitimate
desire, even, and maybe especially in this post-textual,
post-death-of-the-author era.
        Come to think of it, I am right now looking forward with some excitement to
the soon to be published biography of Ed Dorn -- the publication of which
will, I would think, also send a number of people to the work itslef -- &
that finally, is what we want, no? for the poems to be read?

Or the CIA or whoever will stage a fake "liberation attempt" and blame it on
Cuba and use it as an excuse to attack the "last bastion" of communism. I
saw an interview with and ex CIA boss and he was glad of those killed after
his CIA had toppled Allende and was proud that they had "democracy" exceppt
in Cuba: "And look how terrible that is." Keep an eye on this situation.
Thus US is facing a kind of "creeping fascism" .......its likeVietnam:
exactly like: the military are loving this: they are all but running "The
Land of The Free." Only the rich are free anywhere inculding the US.

The trouble is that Ron Silliman, Marjorie Perloff and David Antin and other
"liberals" supported US Imperialist intervention in Afghanistan. Its
impossible for some Americans to see why they are hated in many parts of the
world and to take a non-racial stance. Arabs are "hot blooded"...Justice is
to be found in the US.  Antin, Perloff, and Silliman are of the
establishment now on big salaries: as far as they are concerned the US is in
terrible danger form the "dark men" ... soon they'll be raving like Pound.
Bernstein's response was humane and direct: I admit some of mine were a bit
"crazy", but after my initial reaction, I was opposed always to this futile
"anti-terrorist" infinite justice crap. And I feel passionately for everyone
who is suffering from S11 or anywhere where there is war or poverty.
Anywhere. I am concerned that the US is looking more and more like Nazi
Germany.Somebody over here asked me if I wanted to join the Taleban: but I
am not a Muslim..as much as I support their struggle over there...so far I
am relatively "neutral"...but things arent looking good (nor in
Australia)...(or NewZealand). But I am still keeping open contacts with
Americans, for now. I agree with Scott (I didnt see his post before my last
post). Regards, still,Richard.  PS "it sucks " are the words of someone
trying to be clever or "with it": they sound weak and flippant: almost
inhumane.

If there's no declared war, then the recent attack upon Afghanistan was by
illegal combatants.

There's a fairy story in which one character, guilty, describes the
punishment for the crimes they committed but attributing those crimes to
others

And the guilty one gets the punishment they have wished on the innocent

So my fantasy is: Here is your cage, Mr Bush; please step forward; Mr
Blair...

And of course Mr Sharon

Aldon. I'll butt in here: I think Maria was referring to Zukofsky. Or am I
mixing upa post? But diverting to Brakhage: I;ve seen some of his work and I
found what I saw fascinating...altho I dont think I could handle "Autopsy"
which si described by the poet Iain Sinclair  in his book of poems and
essays  "Flesh Eggs and Scalp Metal" which I reccomend for anyone wanting a
change of tenor and/or a bit of blackness: but sincerely he's brilliant and
interesting on Brakhage.

As to the "objectivists" .. werent they always rather loosely defined by
Zukovsksy's inclusion in "Poetry" and many not having much in common? Your
quote looks interesting: I would agree with it in general eg in his poem
about the death of his father this event IS the event as it happens: but
that is also problematic (that poem is one of the most powerful "angry"
poems on death I've read) ..there are no symbols per se, unless the words
and phrases are, and/but the poem is still an "enactment"... which implies a
certain amount of rhetoric and becomes almost a ritual... closer to the
"objective" ideal would be poems such as the one about the piece of glass
beteen the black wings of the "contagious" hospital: but it is arguable that
his long poem "Spring and All" doesnt metaphorasise "spring"...what makes it
less Eliotic is  his use of prose interventions in the original work...
  I would acknowledge that Eliot is closer to Mallarme and of course
Lafourge..hence influenced by the French symbolists...
 As to the objective correlative is it always to convey the artist's
subjectivity? It may do so: eg the yellow fog that rubs upon the window
pane(s) is the mood at least of Eliots "alter ego" Prufrock (which he might
deny)  but may have been very much a 'piece' or "big part" of Mr Eliot...but
to what extent is Williams not also subjective in his apparently "objective"
way of writing?...I dont see  such a fundamental divide as a "spectrum" say
where eg Robert Lowell is at one end of the poetic spectrum (the supposedly
rigorously subjective altho even that is fraught) and then we shift over to
Berryman or to Spicer then over to Ashbery to O'hara Ted Berrigan and Alice
Notley to Eliot - somewhere in there! - and teh Pound to Williams to
Zukofsky...and on to the Language poets but a better map: if a map could be
made would be more like a Venn Diagram with intersecting styles and aspects
to each writer...eg where would "Kora in Hell" fit in with "Patterson" and
the various parts of "A" ... I think there are parallels with The Waste Land
in the early parts of "A" and also somewhat a parallel with The Waste Land
to Patterson.
  In parts of Zukovfsky's "A" the language effect or use of is strangely
abstract in its very concentration on particulars; the attempt of which may
be a trap: an intriguing and useful one which moves Zukofsky toward Blake
even: obviously Stevens is more significant than has been much mentioned.
  I not so sure of the complete distance between Eliot and Williams...which
topic Bill Austin has commented on before.
  Thoughts of a dry head. Regards, Richard

"This playfulness casts us under the spell of a 'hip gnosis' (to use
one of Lazer's outlandish puns) that open us, in the way only music
and poetry can, to the intimations of love, friendship, and spiritual
searching found everywhere, every day, inside these pages." John Gery

"Days locates itself in the charged rift between immanent and daily
experience and our textual heritage. Hank Lazer seamlessly
ventriloquizes such poets at Stein, Pound, Eigner, and Plath,
sometimes against the grain, making the familiar words new." Rae
Armantrout

Days is Hank Lazer's first large collection of poetry to appear in six
years. Written over the span of one-year-and-a-day, Lazer's new book
is a laboratory space for experimentation with the resources and
possibilities of the short line and for new modes of lyricism. His
previous books of poetry include Simple Harmonic Motions (INK-A!
Press), As It Is (Diaeresis Chapbooks), 3 of 10 (Chax Press), Early
Days of the Lang Dynasty (Meow Press), Doublespace: Poems 1971-1989
(Segue Books), and INTER(IR)RUPTIONS (Generator Press). With Charles
Bernstein, he edits the Modern and Contemporary Poetics Series for the
University of Alabama Press. His two volume collection of critical
writings on contemporary poetry, Opposing Poetries, was published in
1996 by Northwestern University Press. Along with Jake Berry and Wayne
Sides, Lazer is a founding member of The Alabama Poetry Ensemble. A
Professor of English, Lazer is Assistant Vice President for Academic
Af airs at the University of Alabama.

FILM @ INTERNATIONAL HOUSE for the week of January 21-27
3801 Chesnut St.


A FILM @ INTERNATIONAL HOUSE SPECIAL EVENT - The Films of Albert and David

Maysles


Thursday, January 24 - 8:00PM

Admission: $5.00


SALESMAN=20

directed by Albert & David Maysles, 1969, 35mm, 90 mins, Black & White

A fascinating and controversial investigation of American materialism,

Salesman follows the successes and failures of four Boston-based sales

representatives of the Mid-American Bible Company. Their product is a

gilt-edged, DuPont fabricoid, plastic-and-nylon-bound Bible, ("It's washable

and outlasts leather four to one.") The film focuses on the personal crisis

of one of the salesmen, Paul Brennan, who despite the theological pep talks

at the sales convention, finally succumbs to "negative thoughts" after

failing day after day to make a sale.=20

Special Appearance by Albert Maysles


WHAT'S HAPPENING! THE BEATLES IN THE USA=20

directed by Albert & David Maysles, 1964, 16mm, 43 mins, Black & White

The British Invasion starts here as the Maysles follow John, Paul, George

and Ringo for five days: from crazed airport reception to press conferences

to backstage at the Ed Sullivan Show, endless hotel rooms, their horrified

encounter with the legendary DJ Murray the K and finally their equally

frenzied homecoming. Much of the footage shot by the Maysles Brothers would

directly inspire the fictional account of those early days of Beatlemania in

Richard Lester's A Hard Days Night (1964).=20

followed by:


GIMME SHELTER=20

directed by Albert & David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, 1970, 35mm, 90

mins, Color

Considered by many critics to be the greatest rock film ever made, the

Maysles Brothers and Charlotte Zwerin brilliantly capture The Rolling Stones

in peak form during their 1969 US tour. Cutting between a performance at

Madison Square Garden in New York and the ill-fated free concert at San

Francisco's Altamont Speedway, Gimme Shelter is both an exhilarating and

sobering look at the twilight of the sixties cultural revolution in America.

The Philippines will be among the next sites of U.S. interference, with the
U.S. "training" Filipino special forces in special combat methods for the
purpose of putting the insurgents cum kidnappers in Mindanao out of
business.  And this latest neo-imperial interference is justified by the
allegation that Al Qaeda helps/helped to fund "the Islamic militant group
Abu Sayyaf."  True or not, it smacks of the U.S. support of Marcos'
repressive and violent "anti-Communist" programs in the 70s and 80s,
complete with torture and "disappearances".  Poor Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
There are a lot of people in the Philippines, including some relatives of
mine, who are hoping she can avoid handing the country right back to the
U.S. military, especially after they got rid of Estrada.  On the other hand
she may be opportunistically taking the opportunity to clean house--to end
the embarrassment of rebels who kidnap nice missionaries from Kansas once
and for all.  A lot of Filipinos are nervous about the prospect of a renewed
and increased U.S military presence in the Philippines, especially after
that lease on the big naval base finally ran out, not a decade ago.

But when did we ever expect the USA to act according to any
international agreements on anything? They wont pay their UN fees.
They say to hell with environmental accords, even after they sign
them. They bomb the shit out of every smaller country they can find.
They topple elected governments and install unelected ones. Why would
anyone expect the USA to act according to any civil decency rules?

An endangered bird and a dead hero swimming on a sea of red/white/blue with a
cracked liberty bell puts me in mind of John Donne:

"And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
                                         It tolls for thee."

Pierre Etal. I enjoyed that biography of Eliot...it may be the only one: I
think the problem is/was that his second wife has the copywrite (or may even
have destroyed letters to Eliot or vica versa) whatever: its quite
interesting: sure it doesnt get you much closer to T S except you have an
inkling he was a bit glum
most of his life, rather unimpressed on receiving the nobel prize, and so
on. We are all interested in people's lives; all of us gossips and sticky
beaks: that's human nature. There will always be authors and biographies as
long as there are humans. When I get a book of any kind I turn FIRST to the
bio (however brief) of the author. I'm fascinated in what these people are
of have been doing even if its just a pot boiler I pick up. Burroughs is
infinitely more interesting to people because he put a bullet thru his
wife's head! I can always sell his books: Eliot sells I think because people
have heard that they "must" read him...I think most people just put his
books on the shelf together with all the other "great" poets then get back
to watching Judge Judy or Oprah (or over here "Shortland Street) I have to
admit that in the NZ Listener I turn to the back and read Steve
Braunias,skip the poems, but am always interested in the sexy movie stars on
the very last page (to me it the females who are exciting by the way!), then
I console myself with the Chess puzzle from Barden - which I often solve
altho I havent solved the last one....with biographies I am always
fascinated by how people die. I skipped thru Dylan Thomas's bio to read the
section that lead up to his death. How he basically drank himself to death.
How at one stage he "dreamed" of triangles.  Similarly I remember coming
across Sylvia plath's "Ariel" and thinking ...thes are strange: and I went
on a "binge" suspecting she'd topped herself: as to T S ... he didnt jump of
a bridge like Berryman, whose father shot himself, and died rather quietly
in a hospital: when he was younger he had quite good looks: a kind of
"Italianate charm"...these are the details that matter. Trakl poisoned
himself I believe...Celan was another bridge  man...fascinating...Houdini
miscalculated a punch in the stomach (not tightening his stomach muscles
quick enough) and died of internal bleeding: Schoenberg's last words
were/was "harmony! harmony!",  Goethe's you all know was "More light!" (in
German of course),Tolstoy threw himself in front of a train, my mother had a
stroke and was in a "coma" for about 6 months, my father died of lung cancer
(he smoked very much),Mr Hancock died of a brain tumour, Beethoven is
purported to have died in a thunder storm shaking his fist against fate, and
why not, Jack Kerouac had been in a fight and was hit once too often and
drunk and died of a stomach heamorrage - he died in a blood rage - Roethke
died of a heart attack beside a swimming pool, Alekhine (the genius chess
player) was drunk when he fell out of a window in Lisbon, David Jones
suvived the First World War,  Mandelstam had heart trouble and died probably
of neglect and starvation as did Khlebnikov, Pushkin in a duel, as we know
Jackson Pollock suicided in a car crash, Mayakovsky commited dramatic
suicide by gun in protest at himself and possibly for love,  the brilliant
English poet Keith Douglas, who was obsessed by war and soldiering, died it
is thought by a tiny splinter or shock when a shell burst close by leavimg
no mark on his body, Geoffrey Hill (a rather Eliotic poet) isnt dead yet but
he looks so miserable perhaps he could oblige us, several of the English
Kings had some fascinating deaths, and I believe that Sir Walter Raleigh was
beheaded in The Tower, Rilke  got a scratch in his garden and that became
infected and he died of blood poisoning, Rutherford was trimming a tree and
fell and that was his demise, Rupert Brroke of an infection (from his lip
somehow) before he got to the WW1, Shelley drowned in a boat that was badly
desigened (or he actually ceased this life in the sea after being tipped, or
jumping from the boat in question), its not known exactly how Shakespeare
died, Hart Crane of course jumped from a ship, I imagine Emily Dickinson
died with dignity,  Berrigan basically enjoyed himself to death with booze
and pills and wild women and reading incesantly, Robert Creeley is a
survivor, I heard that John Ashbery nearly died once, Ed Dorn had cancer..a
rather bitter man he was amusing and cut through the crap especially with
his "Abhorrences", Woodie Guthrie had (Blank's) disease (Huntingtons chorea)
which is discussed in a book co written by the biochemist and biologist
Bodmer, symptons are "madness" etc and then one slowly deteriorates,
Mohammad Ali is slowly deteriorating due to a similar genetically triggered
disease, so is Dudley Moore, Hitler shot himself thru the roof of his mouth,
the bullet that killed John Kennedy travelled thru his skull on a diagonal
traverse from the right hand rear to the left hand front, Lincoln similarly
but by a hand gun at close range, Swinburne lived to a ripe of old age and
used to walk daily about 5 miles to his favourite pub muttering to himself
but caught a chill and died at a good old age, Rimbaud died of gangrene of
the leg and the rigours of having a sister and his gun running in Africa, I
believe that Raymond Roussell killed himself, Camus died in a car accident,
Randel Jarrrel was suposedly changing a car tyre,O'Hara run down by a beach
buggy, Olson was collected in a car crash (according to Robert Creeley),
many must have died of aids, Spicer died by the word and his love of
liquor..and so it goes on.
  Listers out there must know of some more interesting deaths of poets or
others?  Cheers, Richard.

OK I surrender. I cant beat that:  a black man in front of the US flag. It's
a great dream...but all this juxtaposing of dreams and flags..read
Faulkner's "Light in August" etc (that's the "greatness" of America)...it's
got to be some kind of joke "Martin Luther Freedom"... poor bastard was
assasinated in the US...at least the Kennedys tried  and did  help in the
Civil Rights movement and there has  been progress there in the US but not
in the US's external policies..I dont think that M L King would like that:
better to see some of the political conceptual art...one good thing about he
West so far  (so far) we can critique our governments..trouble is they dont
listen, much. Who is Afro-American or of African nationality extraction:
what do they make of all this S11 and flags and so on? Is the US "The Land
of the Free " for black people? Serious question. Richard.

You are probably not referring to 2 Samuel 9, but it contains a story
similar to what you describe. I'll append it.

-Aaron



The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were two
men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a very
large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one
little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his
children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms.
It was like a daughter to him.

"Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking
one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had
come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and
prepared it for the one who had come to him."

David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as
the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! He must pay for that
lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."

Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God
of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from
the hand of Saul.  I gave your master's house to you, and your master's
wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all
this had been too little, I would have given you even more. Why did you
despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck
down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You
killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.'"

etc.

>Did any New York listserv folk attend Craig Dworkin's
talk "against meaning" last night? If you did, please
report. He's a smart cookie and I'd like to get a gist
of what he's "for."

Tom Thompson

-------------------------------------------------------
To: T.T. From: J.J.
-------------------------------------------------------

I found Craig Dworkin's "Against Meaning" lecture at
the White Box gallery very upsetting.

(I was extremely eager to go:  I rarely leave the
house at night anymore, but I vividly remember his
Barnard conference lecture on Lyn Hejinian and
paranoia.  He shared a panel with Charles Altieri back
then at Barnard.  Dworkin's talk included references
to the asylum-institutionalized "madman" who composed
much of the Oxford English Dictionary.  Dworkin's
scheme had to do with the paranoid underpinnings of
language and the paranoid processes of seeking out and
finding meaning.)

At White Box, he wasn't using the word "paranoid"
anymore.

The audience of perhaps less than three dozen, crammed
together in tightly squeezed chair in the midst of any
otherwise expansive gallery, included much of the
Manhattan illuminati: Charles Bernstein, Bruce
Andrews, Ulla Dydo, Claudia Rankine, Kenny Goldsmith .
. .


Dworkin passed out xeroxed hand-outs.  His hair was
moussed into standing.

Partially from my notes:

He began with George Oppen's ~Discreete Series,~ from
which he drew a model for his "applied
paragrammatics," a reading strategy which he defined
as "willing to sacrifice its reference", "a grammar of
reading".

A "discrete series" is a mathematical term for a
series  where every term is empirically justified,
rather than being derived from preceding propositions.
 That is, as opposed to an arithmetic progression (the
Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8,13...), he gave the subway stops
on an East Side train.

He said, a` la Oppen, that it is the very fact of a
poem's acceptability as a ~mechanism~ that is the
proof of meaning.

He proceeded through trailing verbatim dictionary
definitions which Oppen had followed in the
structuring of his poem: the OED as an organizing
structure.  (His research included that a new printing
of the OED had been a New Year's Day front page
story.)

The multiple definitions for a single word as they
appear in a dictionary are a discrete series, vs. an
inductive "paragogic chain"--- by following a logic
from signifier to signifier: glass > grass > crass >
class, a "bitter romance" of associations.

He spent a good deal of time discussing the word "rim"
in Oppen (with "a straight face").

He next moved on to Saussure's notorious hypogrammes:
"multiple, uncontrollable and unhierarchical
meanings"; DeMan spoke of the "terror" of the letter.

Riffaterre's book, ~The Semiotics of Poetry~: When a
gap opens up between a word and a text, the motivating
anxiety is a single unwritten word.  Texts have an
unwritten core, a "matrix".  Grammatical disruptions
become a clue to the presence of a matrix.

He gave examples.

From Apollinaire's poem, "Monday in Christine Street":


 "Trois becs de gaz allume's
 La patronne est poitrinaire"

("Three gas burners lit / The proprietress is
consumptive"). Dworkin found Apollinaire's name in the
line-endings,

"a-" "-pa-" "-lu-" "naire", or such.

(Saussure's hypogrammes, --- or "la folie de Saussure"
[the madness of Saussure]--- was his similar,
decades-long notebooks, where he traced the names of
Greek gods in Latin literature --- repeat: ~Greek~
gods in ~Latin~ poetry, Aphrodite, etc.)

Not wanting it to seem that the Dworkin method of
reading was applicable only to the avant-garde, he
turned to Robert Frost's old chestnut, "Mending Wall".


(In excerpt: "the frozen ground-swell . . . / . . .
The gaps I mean, / . . . / . . . 'Good fences make
good neighbors.' / . . . I was like to give offense. /
. . . I could say 'Elves' to him, / But it's not elves
exactly").

Dworkin found the same ~Semiotics of Poetry~ dynamic
("it warps itself around a missing core"). (Saussure's
term "hypogramme" was taken from the Greek for
signature.)

"(F)rozen ground-swell" is a synonym for rime frost;
"rime" is a homonym for "rhyme"; "frost" was a term
for "literary failure" that Frost would have been
fighting against.  "The gaps" mean the gaps of
Riffaterre lacunae; for "elves", read "selves".
"fences"/"offence" was a Russian "zdvig" or "shift".

Dworkin's third example, p. 258 from an edition of
Malcolm Lowry's ~Under the Volcano~: "Yvonne's father
made his way . . . earnest candid eyes . . . synthetic
hemp".

This prose hid a Dworkin matrix for the name--- Ernest
Hemingway, Lowry's literary father (known as "Papa
Hemingway", with "Papa" appearing on a preceding
page):

earnest hemp way.

These repeated examples were his self-admitted defense
against accusations of a "readerly hat trick" or
"hermeneutical prestidigitation".

He said he found "recourse to soft psychology not
satisfying either" (Lowry, writing around a bullfight,
thinks of Hemingway), but acknowledged "the degree to
which readers are more comfortable with corroborative"
evidence.

He said he found these hypograms "factually,
incontroveribly there"; that it was not chance and
permutations.


In Elizabeth Bishop's "The Moose", which is about an
animal (C.D. cited critical commentary as to grandiose
literary themes), he said the poem is about---
~orthodonture.~

He lined up words: "PINK glancing", "beat-up ENAMEL",
"BLEACHED, ridged as clamshells", "BRUSHING the dented
flank", "waits, PATIENT", and "BRACES" to refer to
unmentioned teeth.

Bishop at the time was going to the dentist twice a
week.  (---Bathos?)

(My notes do not record Dworkin commenting on the
French word for tooth, "dent", and Bishop's "dented".)

In passing, he also cited Zukofsky, where three or
four mentions of "law" are closely accompanied by
"tessera", he said, but without Z. ever using the word
"mosaic" (Mosaic law = the Law of Moses)!


The Q-&-A was not quite sympathetic: the first
questioner accused him of not "opening onto paths that
might lead us away from meaning" ("Against Meaning")
but rather back to classic modernist grids, an
aligning, congruences.   Another questioner seemed
argumentative in talking about an "architectonic
self".

I was quite bothered.  My question accused his project
of reenacting what Geoffrey Hartman's 1981 ~Saving the
Text~ had already done with the Romanticists
(Wordsworth: word's worth; etc.), which Hartman called
"the spectral name."

Dworkin (with the exception of Bishop's teeth) was in
all cases "re-discovering" embedded in the text what
was already conspicuously written at the top of the
text: the author's name.

This differed greatly from Saussure's hypogramme
matrices, which found the names of gods like "Apollo"
(Saussure's Apollo had been Dworkin's springboard into
Apollinaire) or "Aphrodite", --- which, importantly,
were not individual author's lemon ink autographs but
~suprapersonal.~  Saussure, in search for an
explanation for these disturbing archaic forces
inscribed across so many writers' texts, even
conjectured whether there might have been some cultic
or religious explanation.

Dworkin, instead,

at exactly our contemporary turning-pint where reading
and criticism have moved beyond the fantasy of
(writing packaged one-for-one to) the discrete unit of
a self-sufficient author, broader territorities
(wilderness) of language as common possession, and
a-subjective propulsions that are the agency for
writing,

was re-bundling or "re-authoring" these texts back
under the ~souscription~ of the individual author,
neat bundles.

Bishop's teeth: biographical reductivism.

What would be ~interesting~ would be finding Louis
Zukofsky's name in Lowry, or Hemingway's in Frost, I
suggested.


Dworkin demonstrated no corrective familiarity with
statistics and randomness, or their anomalies.  He had
fallen into a statistical rabbit-hole.  (You'd be
amazed how many time the same doubles will come up in
a row.)

Definitely, the name is a narcissistic imago, and we
develop fetishistic attachments to its letters.  But
Dworkin was going from general principles to a sort of
"Find-a-Word" puzzle, where the solution --- surprise!
--- in x out of y cases was a game of nominal,
diagonal acrostics.

He responded by saying that he thought it might have
something to do with the numinous or nebulous status
of personal names as words, which he does not
understand.


---I can't see how it moves "our" mission forward to
go retrograde (moving from a self of societal
construction to a metaphysics of "confidential, to the
point of secrecy," as he said about Oppen).  He's
re-instating the self-enclosed, autonomous figure of
the writer as the prime deciphering key to the text,
where the "punch line" solution will be finding at the
end what you started off with at the beginning.

His insistence on the "objectivity" of his findings
and truth was jettisoning the whole rich ground of
indeterminacy, and ambiguity, and The Absurd (that
which can be neither true nor false).


---To say nothing of the spuriousness of his
methodology.

The Lowry Hemingway was a single confabulation
("objective" or not) on p. 258 of a 400 pp. novel.

A "proof" strung out of four, maybe five tenuous
examples, one of them (the Zukofsky) undocumented
yields a whole paragrammatics.  Between one example
and the next, however, there was considerable
~slippage,~ with name only putatively unifying
tellingly different cases:

Frost's name was hidden in synonyms, but was his own
name in his own text;

Apollinaire's name was his own name in his own text,
but appeared as splintered syllables, unlike Frost's
rebus;

Lowry's Hemingway was made up of splintered syllables,
but was somebody else's name, not the author's;

"Moses" in Zukofsky involved neither the author's name
nor that of a living or real person nor syllables: it
depended on a Latin-to-English translation.

Bishop's had nothing to do with names or any
"unwritten word" at all, per se (a body part,
instead); etc.


Dworkin's schizo-analysis was conducted without even
passing reference to the possibility of a rhetorical
trope of paronomasia.  Writers writing without any
sense of pun.


In resuscitating, after ~The Death of the Author,~
these authors this way, and stressing "objectivity",
Dworkin absolved himself of the uncomfortable position
of being a ~reader~ with responsibility for his own
idiosyncratic dyslexias: instead, the return of the
invisible, Archmidean critic.


I think he lost ground by backing away from his
previous "paranoia" model (which was anti-subjective).
 By moving on instead to a hunt for neutral alphabetic
solutions, punch-lines, he has, in a sense, deepened
his previous project further by joining into the
affectlessness of paranoia's clues.

Paranoia is, literally (etymologically), ~beside~
feelings, that is, always a little to the left or
right of emotions. Paranoia is more concerned with
cracking the FBI's cryptography than with what ~it
feels like~ to be so consumed and monomaniacal.

He said that the very fact that Frost and Bishop
scholars become upset with him makes him think he's on
to something.  Others' emotive frustration is not an
academically recognized barometer for confirming a
hypothesis.

We were left with handfuls of alphabet blocks,
Scrabble solitaire played with books.  Even were they
delivered less objectionably, those details could have
been bridges into empathic deepening with the source
texts, instead of "A-ha!" eureka at yet another ghost
writer's signature: Bishop's toothache becomes a sort
of joke, in its mundanity, rather than an opportunity
to connect with the force of personal, physical pain
(toothache, after all, being even Wittgenstein's
preferred metaphor for investigations into the
language of pain and private sensations); Zukofsky's
unwritten (oral?) "Mosaic law" was not a segue into
glimpsing the proud, idealized self-identification
that he, as a Jew, self-aggrandized with the sainted
law-giver; ...


Dworkin must be right: I'm as bothered as the Frost
scholars.

(And from ~Princeton,~ no less!)

$12.00. Available from Small Press Distribution: 1341 Seventh St. =
Berkeley, CA 94710.
HEADLINES is both a way of writing a new novel and is a extended poem or =
set of poems at the same time. "Each word in John Crouse's HEADLINES is =
capitalized so that they are sensual, alone, blowholes -- one word many =
things -- or as he says 'Comprehensive Azures Contiguous Stacks =
Floating.' It's as if ONE'S READING IT is an alphabet that changes =
experiencing: 'I Saw Me Backward Yesterday. Have It Float.'" -- Leslie =
Scalapino
"In HEADLINES, John Crouse's chancy motion measure allows all sorts of =
rolling specifics to place and pace themselves. The 'plot' builds and =
recedes in layers, like bricks, or sand, townhouses, or dictionary =
entries...He's on to something, tremendous, jarringly appealing." -- =

Well, first of all, let me say that I'm not familiar with Eliot's thoughts on this whole matter... but, whatever they may have been, it seems a little odd to say that the purpose of biographies is to show "the reality of," in this case, "Eliot's life to Eliot."  Sure, that's not a feasible task and probably not a feasible idea either.  I wonder if it's even worth being desired though.  After all, if this direct personal "reality" in biography is both desired and considered unattainable, then any biographical text--the nebulosity of this category cuts both ways--in inevitably falling short of said ideal, ends up being treated as some kind of second best that we just have to settle for--which I don't buy.

It seems to me that while this tendency towards this second-best treatment of biographical meaning can come from those who believe in the idea and desirabilty and achievabilty of this biographical ideal, it can equally come from those who find it to be a lie, because calling it a lie can also end up strengthening the very definition of it, and thus the idea remains just as strong, regardless of one's feeling about it.  The believers find the notion that it all aint possible scandalous, because if it's so, then look at what we have to settle for, etc.  The non-believers say the idea isnt possible, and because the idea's still there, then we have to settle for second best, so deal with it, etc.  (I realize I'm oversimplifying here and making it too dialectical, but humor me.)
So if we're to say that biography, and experience, is inevitably discontinuous, constructed, revised, and so forth, then those points only become scandalous if we first had/have the notion--whether we agree/d with it or not--that it was, or ought to be, otherwise.  I do think that experience is discontinuous, a "series of forgettings," and all that, and since that's what I've had before me to work with from the get-go and it's suited me reasonably well, there's nothing disappointing about it.  I think describing experience this way is becoming much much less surprising, and thus less shocking, especially for younger generations.  Furthermore, the fact that experience and self-knowing seem to work this way is _precisely_ what makes biography worthwhile in the first place. (What one does with biography is a separate question entirely.) So it's inherently fictive, constructed, forgetful, and the work of an observer.  Good!  So's everything that my friends say about me, and if th
 ere's every to be a biography abo
ut me, they'd certainly be the most reliable sources.

FURTHER DETAILS:

Poets Theater Jubilee

San Francisco’s poetic communities have, over the years, been the location
of many exhilarating experiments in theater. With minimal formal support,
poets & their supporters in the theater community have staged readings &
mounted productions of adventurous (& often hilarious) scripts. Beginning
in the 1950s, when Robert Duncan, Helen Adam, Jack Spicer & Michael
McClure first wed poetry to the stage, through the language experiments of
Carla Harryman, Bob Perelman & Kit Robinson, to the ambitious work today
of Leslie Scalapino, Kevin Killian, Camille Roy, Michael Amnasan and many
more, fine local experimental writers have worked in this genre.

Small Press Traffic, New Langton Arts, & the Jon Sims Center for the Arts
are joining together to present Jubilee, a Festival of Poets Theater. We
wish to extend our local tradition, while at the same time, honor it with
some critical attention. The festival will include four evenings of plays,
& a historical panel. We are building on the success of dozens of past
productions of poets theater in San Francisco, a long history with many
incandescent moments. We want to expand this nascent movement into a
full-stage celebration.

"The finest in typos, misspellings & awkward phrases since 1995"

"LUNGFULL! is my favorite magazine even before I've read it"
     -- Sparrow, 1994

LUNGFULL! magazine, a journal of poetry, prose, art & rough drafts, first
opened its covers in 1995.  Since that time, we've grown from a photocopied
downtown zine to a thick, lush & entirely waterproof journal with a hearty
readership throughout America & Europe.  During that time we've continued
to print the rough drafts of contributors' work along side the final
versions & have no intention of letting up now.

Indeed it is with some pride that we announce our doe-eyed site is now
aloft & fluttering gracefully at http://users.rcn.com/lungfull -- rife with
poems in rough & final form, letters to the editor, a deceitful editorial,
photos, fine print, announcements not unlike this one, oh you name it.

On the wing,
Brendan Lorber

& Now, some bios of the readers, mostly in their own words.

ISSUE 7: Brandon Downing is originally from San Francisco, where Lungfull!
first flirted with him from a heroic, surprise distance. There, he was
co-founder and director of Blue Books, America's only all-small press,
poetry, and bookarts bookstore, where he curated the Books Readings #1
Series, and the Readings at Adobe Books Series, for many years. He is the
founding editor of the magazine 6,500, and his books include LAZIO and DOG

since 1966 and has done books since 1972, presenting the work of such
writers as Sherman Alexie, Ha Jin,  Kimiko Hahn, Hettie Jones, Tony Towle,

Alan is jumping up and down with excitement!
Women approve heartily and men drink more beer as Alan sings "Begin the
 Beguine."
You fall down laughing.
You cry.
You say, "It's amazing, I just got a new car!"
You say, "Begin the Beguine and it's really all mine and there's
 nothing more so show me the door"
You say, "There were two rabbis, isn't that funny enough?"
You say, "Death is all around us, beware beware of death"
You open your arms wide, begging the populace to embrace you.
You pull your arms around your body.
You say, "Please help me, I am amazingly beautiful..."
You say, "Thank you all my loves, you have me me love myself..."
You pucker your lips expectantly.
You kiss yourself.
You say, "Oh beauty, I am waiting for you to come to me!"
You say, "I will begin with my own body, oh Penelope! and end with
 yours!"

No, that isn't it, but from this point of view it's the same. I think must
have read _Samuel_, but it hasn't stayed. So, thanks for that.

I think that what is coming into my memory is a Hans Anderson story. The
guilt woman - tho' guilt of what I cannot remember - wants the innocent
woman rolled down the hill in a barrel with nails hammered inwards

The king knew all about this before he asked her to name the punishment
(maybe he got  the  job on merit) and led her on to condemn herself

| You are probably not referring to 2 Samuel 9, but it contains a story
| similar to what you describe. I'll append it.
|
| -Aaron
|
|
|
| The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were
two
| men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a
very
| large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one
| little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and
his
| children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his
arms.
| It was like a daughter to him.
|
| "Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from
taking
| one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had
| come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man
and
| prepared it for the one who had come to him."
|
| David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as
| the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! He must pay for that
| lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."
|
| Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the Lord, the
God
| of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you
from
| the hand of Saul.  I gave your master's house to you, and your master's
| wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all
| this had been too little, I would have given you even more. Why did you
| despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck
| down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own.
You
| killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.'"
|
| etc.

L'apr=E8s-Bourdieu a commenc=E9,

La "mis=E8re du monde" est incommensurable. Derni=E8re nouvelle du front :
Pierre est mort. Bourdieu, le professeur honoraire, titulaire de la
chaire
de sociologie au Coll=E8ge de France, a quitt=E9 la sc=E8ne intellectuelle,=
 le
champ des m=E9dias et celui de la vie tout court. Hier soir, dans un b=EAte
h=F4pital parisien, il a livr=E9 son dernier combat =E0 71 ans, l=E2ch=E9 s=
a
derni=E8re
prise, contre la maladie.
Pierre Bourdieu =E9tait un combattant de la sociologie, un intellectuel,
un
militant. Il avait commenc=E9 par inventer les mots (concepts) qui lui ont
permis de transgresser les r=E8gles. Il a su distinguer, derri=E8re les
voiles
d'apparence =E9galitaire, derri=E8re les m=E9andres d'une d=E9mocratie repu=
e,
les
m=E9canismes de reproduction, les coups bas port=E9s au nom d'une
m=E9ritocratie
pip=E9e, les discours de justification d'un syst=E8me qui tourne sur
lui-m=EAme,
en excluant ceux qui ne sont pas du bon c=F4t=E9 du "capital" (culturel,
social
ou symbolique).
Avec Bourdieu, les in=E9galit=E9s ont pris un nouveau visage. Le rapport
entre
dominants et domin=E9s n'est plus seulement =E9conomique ou social. Ce
serait
trop simple, trop "lisible". Les r=E8gles du grand jeu se cachent dans nos
"habitus", dans ce qui s'=E9change entre les acteurs sociaux : fa=E7on de
parler, niveau d'aisance, de socialisation, etc. Le comprendre, les
conna=EEtre, c'est pouvoir mieux les combattre.
Depuis la mort de Sartre (1981), on manquait d'intellectuels "engag=E9s"
pour
parler du monde. Bourdieu fut celui l=E0. Objet de toutes les pol=E9miques,
de
quelques id=F4latries aussi. "Bourdieusiens", les anti-mondialisation ?
Sans
doute, comme la plupart des militant-es de ces ann=E9es blafardes, vou=E9es
=E0
l'ultra-lib=E9ralisme triomphant. Le sociologue a jou=E9 son r=F4le
d'intellectuel
"critique" : =E9clairant les chemins sinueux =E0 c=F4t=E9 des autoroutes,
donnant un
peu de sens =E0 l'action, se voulant autant donneur d'exemples que de
le=E7ons.
Les plus jeunes le d=E9couvrirent lors du mouvement de d=E9cembre 95, l'ont
suivi aux c=F4t=E9s des sans-papiers, ont lu ses opuscules donnant des
"Raisons
d'agir", avant de d=E9vorer ses premiers ouvrages.
Ceinture noire de judo, Bourdieu faisait de ses concepts des "armes de
combat" et de la sociologie un sport de combat. Il laisse des mots
=E9crits,
parl=E9s, des paroles de lutte, d'intelligence du monde, et de sa mis=E8re.
Il
laisse aussi quelques "h=E9ritiers", qui voient d=E9j=E0 avec les yeux du
professeur. Sauront-ils, apr=E8s la tristesse, d=E9passer le constat si
intelligent soit-il, d'une pens=E9e de l'action, pour poser une action
pens=E9e
? Bourdieu a dit la n=E9cessit=E9 de la r=E9volte contre la mis=E8re du mon=
de.
Il
est mort avant d'avoir dit toutes ses beaut=E9s, ses potentialit=E9s. Il a
quitt=E9 le "champ" (de bataille) sans avoir fini de donner les "champs"
du
possible.
L'apr=E8s-Bourdieu vient de d=E9marrer. C'est jour de f=EAte chez les salau=
ds.
C'est jour de tristesse pour les autres. La mis=E8re du monde semble plus
grande encore et le combat plus in=E9gal. Bourdieu est mort. L'h=E9ritage
s'annonce lourd. Pierre est mort. Et il reste un monde =E0 changer.

I just heard the the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu died last night from
cancer at 71. Although much of the later sociology work could seem
problematic from a poetics point-of-view {& years ago the French poet Michel
Deguy wrote a scathing criticism of Bourdieu's famous "La Distinction"), his
heart was in the right place, with his recent acticity against globalism,
including the founding of the radical publishing house, only the tip of the
iceberg of an honest activist intellectual's career. My own preference goes
towards his earliest work, socio-anthropological work on Maghrebian Berber
societies. -- Pierre

Subject:      Against Dworkin Against Meaning
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" ; format="flowed"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

Jeffrey,

Thanks for your full report on Dworkin's talk. Sounds like I didn't
miss much by staying home to tend my flu-ridden kids=8A But what I
didn't miss, I did gain by your report. I'm interested in the things
you pointed to re: Dworkin's previous positions on "paranoia" (a talk
I regrettably missed):  A poetics that is "beside" emotion. But this
placement, making emotions "beside the point," also places the point
firmly in the realm of "systems" (I think here with zero theoretic
back-up of the classic "paranoid" enemy being "them," the system as
=46BI, the system as Corporate Conspiracy). I think of Michael Scharf's
"I LOVE SYSTEMS" piece I just read on the glorious ubu.com: "I love
systems, they are but structures for action, for encounter and
exchange." But for Scharf systems are exploitable by opposing forces,
forces I'll outline here, lazily, as "corporations" and "writers."
=46or Scharf, both writers and corporations use systems, but for
opposite ends - the former to open up exchange in multiple
directions, the latter to funnel exchange in one great sucking sound
straight into their coffers. The two poles of this dichotomy
admittedly infect each other often -- as Scharf, a guy who also
writes "for" the Cahners corporation, is quick to point out (as
should I, a guy who writes ad copy for a living). "A shit where I eat
problem," says Scharf, pointedly. An old friend from my graduate
school days is appalled at my paying job in advertising. But could
knowing both the construction and deconstruction of a system make you
better at the more writerly kinds of operations? At showing how
corporations desire and writers suck? Well, Bernstein didn't have to
write ad copy to rewire its systems=8A I digress=8A

I thought Dworkin might be going somewhere with talk of Oppen's
discrete series. It's a way to talk about "meaning," no? But to do so
"against" conventional ideas of meaning; that is, meaning (I'm only
thinking now) as constructed serially, or as a "paragogic chain"
(lord, help me with "paragoia," graduate school was over 10 years
ago). So, Clinton was almost right: but before we can discuss what
the meaning of "is" is, we need to talk about what the meaning of
"meaning" is.

This, perhaps, pointing toward a poetics that relies not simply on
formal games -- not games of form, but games that form, deform,
reform systems? That act socially or individually, experimentally,
and in many directions. I'm thinking here of games like what
Bernstein does with nursery rhyme structure=8A and Dickinson with
similar hymn structure=8A turning fixed aims to shifty purposes.

Thanks again, Jeffrey, for the thoughtfulness of your report=8A

Tom

I always think one of the saddest ones is poor Isaac Rosenberg, who not only
enlisted in the British Army because he needed the money, was condescended
to by Ezra Pound in his letters, but also managed to get killed by a direct
hit from a German shell (apparently there was nothing whatsoever left of
him).

On April the 1st.

From Liberation:

Le sociologue français Pierre Bourdieu est décédé mercredi soir des suites
d'un cancer à l'âge de 71 ans à l'hôpital Saint-Antoine de Paris. Né le 1er
août 1930 à Denguin (Pyrénées-atlantiques), dans une famille d'origine
paysanne, Bourdieu, agrégé de philosophie, débute sa carrière comme
professeur au lycée de Moulins (Allier) en 1955. Il enseigne ensuite à Alger
(1958-1960), à Paris puis à Lille (Nord).

De 1964 à 1980, Pierre Bourdieu est directeur d'études à l'Ecole pratique
des hautes études, devenue d'Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales.
Il est parallèlement directeur de la revue Actes de la recherche en sciences
sociales. Titulaire de la chaire de sociologie au Collège de France depuis
1981, Pierre Bourdieu avait acquis une certaine renommée dès 1964 en
publiant avec Jean-Claude Passeron «Les Héritiers», un ouvrage qui, quatre
ans avant Mai 68, formulait une critique fondamentale de l'enseignement
supérieur français.

Il a ensuite connu un franc succès public avec «La Misère du monde» (1993),
une enquête sur la souffrance sociale. En 1996, il fonde l'association
«Liber/Raisons d'agir», éditrice de petits livres militants dénonçant le
néo-libéralisme, une lutte incessante qui lui tenait au coeur. Bourdieu
avait ainsi soutenu la candidature de l’humoriste Coluche à l’élection
présidentielle de 1980, puis apporté son soutien aux grévistes et aux
sans-papiers en grève de la faim en 1995. Il avait également fondé le Comité
international de soutien aux intellectuels algériens (Cisia).

Il était notamment l’auteur de «La Distinction» (1979), «Ce que parler veut
dire» (1982), «La Noblesse d'Etat» (1989), «Les règles de l'Art» (1992),
«Sur la télévision» (1997) et «La Domination masculine» (1998).

Traum

Nikuko, listen. I don't sleep. I have had episodes. My anger threatens the
world. I have had red suns I cannot escape. I cannot escape the sky. The
red sky is everywhere. Nikuko, listen. I am sleeping. I wake after the
first episode; I sleep again. I wake after the second, after more convul-
sions; again I sleep. I wake after the third, and that is the end of it.

I came naked to you to show you everything. I want to seduce you with my
broken anger. Listen: I dreamed I was in a train station, a waiting room,
a classroom at a university. There was a woman dressed in brown leather, a
beautiful jacket. Black hair, perhaps from Montreal or Paris. Those
features. I bump into her. She smashes me, I bend over in violent pain. I
wake up. I wake up in convulsions. You know, the body moves suddenly
against all will, out of control. One wakes up in sweat. She's gone. The
anger fades. Lassitude sets in.

I want to seduce you. I want you to come naked and broken to me. I want to
see your breasts, your cunt. I want to touch everything. I want you to
belong to me, Nikuko, I want to own you. Listen: I sleep again. There is a
man present, similarly dressed. Both of them are in their late twenties.
He is her boyfriend. He approaches me, knees me in the abdomen, slams my
face. I fall to the ground like a worm. I can't move. I jerk about. I
convulse. I wake up.

I want you so bad this might be a dream. I want your body in my face. I
want to live in your odor. I want you all over me. I want my body bruised
with you. I want your territory marked. Listen: I sleep again. This is the
worst. I am in pain. I am standing near a table or desk. A security guard
walks by. I reach for his gun. I take it from his holster. It's a nine
millimeter pistol.

I am looking at you now, Nikuko. I am undressing you with my eyes. I take
the pistol and begin shooting. People try to leave to my left, there is a
door. It is brown, wood. I shoot them. The pistol hums, it doesn't go
pop-pop-pop. It hums with the beauty of death. It warms to my hand. I am
in fury. I am furious anger. I will take everyone out.

Yes, Nikuko, this is healthy. This is a true way of thinking. I mow them
down. I mow everyone down, left and right. People are screaming. It means
nothing to me, I let them scream. Do you see how I am, Nikuko, how it is.

Nothing bothers me, Nikuko, nothing. Listen: I run out of ammunition. For
a moment I am afraid all will be lost. I have numerous clips I have taken
from the security guard. From somewhere, I have a second gun. I hold the
gun on the survivors. I load the clip in the other gun, the first gun, my
warm gun. I am worried I am loading the clip incorrectly. How would I know
how to load a clip.

I first knew I would know how to load a clip when I felt the gun firing
once again, warm in my hand, warm with the beauty of it. No pop-pop-pop,
just the humming sound. People are running and screaming again.

Now I will tell you. There is a silence now. There is a silence and it is
a very deep silence. My anger knows no bounds. It travels through horizons
that move with me, like the horizon of a blood-red boiling ocean. There
are no limits. Nikuko, I tell you, there are no limits. Look at my skin.
Look at all of it. I own you, Nikuko. I own all of you, every bit of you.
Show me all of you, Nikuko. I convulsed in the sheets of the bed. I woke
up.

I woke up frightened, Nikuko, frightened of everything.

I am afraid of my power, of my lack of fear. I am afraid of what I will do
with the gun. I am afraid of infinity. I look at you and undress you with
my eyes. Take everything off, Nikuko, I own you.

I am fascinated by your response to my power.

This is the end of it. You are that girl. You are mine to do what I will.
I am sure you are that girl. Take off your panties.

Is it because girl take off my panties that you came naked and broken to
me? Are you annoyed that girl take off your panties that I came naked and
broken to you? Have you been annoyed often? Stop making excuses for
yourself. Please please don t ever leave me. Are you sure that don t ever
leave you? When did you first know that don t ever leave me? What happened
when did me first know that don t ever leave you? What happened at the
time when did you first know that don t ever leave me? What would happen
if you had a gun and if did me first know that don t ever leave you? Is
the fact that don t ever leave me the real reason? Does the fact that don
t ever leave you the real reason explain anything else? Have you been
positive don t ever leave me the real reason explain anything else? You
mentioned that you would like to seduce? Is it because I would like to
seduce that you came naked and broken to me? Did you ever regret you would
like to seduce that I came naked and broken to you? Why should I get to
seduce? When did you first know that should you get to seduce? What would
happen if we did it or if did me first know that should I get to seduce?
Is the fact that should you get to seduce the real reason? Does the fact
that should I get to seduce the real reason explain anything else? Are you
certain should you get to seduce the real reason explain anything else? Is
it because of your life that you are going through all this?

(Here's the editorial from the first issue of Boog City. Below it is
information on contributors and a call for submissions)

the Beginning of a Great Adventure

The premier issue of Boog City is brought to you by the letters K and P,
as in Kristin Prevallet, whose piece ìDear George Bushî is in the
centerspread.

Iíve known Kristin for a long time. I first met her back at the then
Naropa Institute, now University, in Boulder, Colorado, us two hanging
around their legendary writing and poetics program, the Jack Kerouac
School of Disembodied Poetics.

Kristin had come out to Boulder from the State University of New York at
Buffalo, where she was coediting the poetics journal apex of the M with
Alan Gilbert. Unlike most editors, they didnít just find cool words and
print them, instead they jumped headfirst into the fray, beginning
controversies and inspiring hate mail, all-in-all, mucking it up, and it
was beautiful.

Itís about a decade later, and Kristinís still doing it. She is a damn
solid essayist and poet, who takes on the politics of the state and
abusers of authority.

So mid-December, there was all this false patriotism flying in
everyoneís faces. There was the gourmet soup shopís menu with the
collage of the Twin Towers, the stars and stripes, and a bald eagle.
There were pictures of the on-fire Twin Towers, according to The New
York Times, being sold from beneath sidewalk vendorsí bridge tables,
while the photos of the towers in their former glory were out on
display. There were American flags everywhereóon pizza pie boxes;
hanging, wind-shredded, off of car antennas;  or, in my case, being left
by building management on the floor outside every apartment in my
complex as though they were doormats.

Amid all this insanity that is a post-Cold War nation seeking an enemy,
any enemy, to define itself; in a nation seeking ìInfinite Justiceî only
to settle for ìEnduring Freedom,î I kept wondering who the hell is going
to give me the words to get out there about why George Bush, quite
simply, is wrong, despite approval numbers that would have made any mom
proud if you brought them home from your intro to American foreign
policy class freshman year at Yale.

I heard those words about Bush early in the evening during the 27th
Annual New Yearís Day Marathon at St. Markís Church, when Kristin
Prevallet stepped to the microphone in the sanctuary, and said, simply,
ìDear George Bush,î her passion building with each statement, each line
of her letter/poem/essay.

So read ìDear George Bushî (p. 5), unwrap the comfort of the flag from
your body, and think about this nation at war. Revenge is nice for a
Charles Bronson flick, but this is real life, and what the hell are we
doing, and is it right.

This is Boog City, a community newspaper from a group of artists and
writers based in and around New York Cityís East Village, either
physically or spiritually, and sometimes both.

This is Boog City, a group of people who question authority, and create
amazing art while doing so.

This is Boog City, a community of New Yorkers, Americans, citizens of
the world, who flourish everyday amid every reason not to.

This is Boog City, hop in the front seat, and put your shoulder to the
wheel.

as ever,
David Kirschenbaum,
editor and publisher

Also sounds like Kafka's "In the Penal Colony," where a
soldier who has been accused of insubordination and
condemned without trial (sound familiar?) is about to be
executed, by means of a ghastly machine that inscribes a
man's sentence on his flesh with needles -- only to be
granted a last-minute reprieve, because the officer in
charge of the execution is in fact the guilty party.

Heard Sylvia Nasar on Fresh Air this evening -- she wrote
the book on John Nash, who during his schizophrenic decades
did elaborate numerological/mathematical 'research' in
order to uncover encoded correspondences whose presence
he'd intuited (i.e., voices told him). Nasar: "He had a
young economist at Princeton help him write a computer
program to transform Rockefeller's name, to which he
attached great significance, into base-26, and then to
factor this very large number. He was looking for
connections between things like the telephone number in the
Senate cloakroom, the social security number of
mathematician he knew, and the birthdate of Brezhnev."
Listening, I was reminded of Jeffrey's account.

Even more than the problem of the re-inscription of the
author's name, what strikes me as disturbing about
Dworkin's approach (by this account) is its appearance of
objective empiricism, as though this content (any content)
is patently "there" in the text, rather than immanent in
the social transaction. That these names, or dental
records or what have you, are part of an "unwritten core,"
rather than a manifest content, sounds like logical
positivism in a deconstructive guise. But, had it all been
presented in a spirit of play (viz Garrett Stewart hearing
an unspoken "love" in Keats's "the fee/l of/ not to feel
it") it might have been more compelling.

altering (responding to a text)^2


the ruins of buildings. i can't write from anything else. tonight, the
water stopped in our apartment. the apartment ran dry. there are sounds
of struggle in the pipes.
following a sentence in the possessive and possession of characters,
a gap or hiatus. wayward or contrary characters. of the harshness of
daily politics.
of the real and virtual jennifer, julu, alan, nikuko. of the real and
virtual honey, travis, tiffany.
jennifer years ago started off as about 12 in the early stuff then moved
to 20s-something; nikuko i imagine in her 30s; julu 24.
i keep wanting to kill them off. i killed off jennifer a long time ago,
she had a bier and everything, then returned.
before that, travis, honey, and tiffany all disappeared. i can't write
dialog for males, it's not that i can write it for females, i can't at
all, but with males it devours me from inside. it's a distrust of males,
of male authority. it's built-in, a bad engine.
males are bad engines. males absorb, i write from the debris, effluvia,
of absorption.
alan is a character but alan is also a stain or residue, almost always
disappearing by the end of the show if he were there in the first place.
alan wants to disappear but engrave in stone.
alan wants to engrave everything in stone and then rails against totality
and writes dubious philosophy. that doesn't make sense.
it's almost as if alan wishes that nikuko speaks through alan, both of
them in a ring: jennifer on the east, julu on the west.
north and south are unguarded; they always are, the cold-spots of the ring
of Aphra Behn's desire.
there are disappearances. as one might say, there are disappearances and
disappearances. they follow this odd desire. they generate an inchoate
politics reaching up through the surface like the hand in Carrie.
the texts come from dreams (of the real or virtual dreams) (of careful
considerations and the clarity of thought), go back in and mess with them.
nothing comes out but different, not therapy or recuperation or balance,
but a mess that takes off on its own: alan with the 9 millimeter, nikuko
listening as if entranced.
Alan writing in a trance or entrance. Nikuko listening in departure.
they occupy an aspect ratio. alan thinks: better to return to coding,
code-work made obvious (although Traum came out of a rewrite of the
emacs doctor program) - better returning to abstraction or scaffolding,
rather than the mud on the rungs as one climbs, impossibly, among the
ruins of buildings in the east, in the west.
not of buildings in the cold, northern and southern poles: where the
writing originates. frozen, immobilized.
writing from magnesis, magnetic poles, hysteresis looped.

from Alan, never from dreams

Howdy all,

As there are many NYers on this list, I thought I'd mention that the
New York Public Library recently subscribed to COMBO.  If any of you kind
souls had a hand in their doing this, thank you very much.  In any event,
it's there to be perused, pass the word.

And Rossenberg was Jewish and a great anti-war poet and that is how "fate"
deals with us: we disappear. But we struggle on: the paradox of Pound: Its
all said by Charles Bernstein very well in  "Pounding Fascism" from  "A
Poetics". In 1991 I was in a class and we were all (sme of us adult
students) coming across -eg Marrianne Moore)) and somewhat Pound for the
first time. a woman asked the lecturer how a poet who could write so
powerfully of the 1st Wordld War and its futilty...a war for a "gross of
battered books,...and old bitch gone in the teeth.." and the bodies sighing
in their death on the barbed wire.. could become a Nazi supporter: an active
fascist: unfotunately it colours my think(ing) toward him: I hope I dont
become so bitter about recent and (certain ongoing and past American
military-politica) actions that I turn my back on the US full stop..I was
talking to a man from Kashmir (a Moslem) and he said to me "No, it is not
the Anerican peole, it is the politicians, the military..." and so on. You
have Moslems who support the US people...despite everything. Let's
see...Richard.

Boog Literature Chapbook #28

Let's Eat Red for Fun (Hoa Nguyen)/Pax Americana (Dale Smith)

(ordering info and specs at the conclusion of this email.)

_____________________________

Hi all,

I've always loved the form of the flipbook. The first Boog publication,
in August1991, was a flip chapbook. Later on I discovered Patchen's
classic doubleheader.

When Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith told me over a year and a half ago of
their plans to come to New York, and for them each to read in separate
spaces, I thought, "Hey, how about we do a flipbook of the two of you."
Dale created the assignment for the two of them, writing on politics,
communism for Hoa, capitalism for Dale. A few months later each of their
mss arrived, first Dales, and then Hoa's.

I took their words to Birmingham, Ala. and read them everywhere, on the
Southwest herd flight, in the park where Bull Connor sicced dogs and
turned hoses on his town's citizens  almost 40 years ago, to the hotel
my friend Alex and I checked out of a few hours after a knock on the
door by someone looking for Tony. I took Hoa and Dale with my
everywhere, and now, after a year's delay, they'll take you even
further.

Some of Hoa's poem's in the collection previously appeared in the Hat,
Mungo vs. Ranger, the Transcendental Friend, How2, and Lungfull. Some of
Dale's appeared in the Hat and canwehaveourballback.com.

Here's a poem from each of the authors to whet yr appetites.:

Hoa Nguyen

[Untouched bubble gum me]

Untouched bubble-gum me
fruity and whole
Scream wrapped in plastic
Sling your barbells in the air

Seismic nervous falling
(walking the fence no hands)

Pink bubble-gum doll wrapped
in purple coveralls
running away
dragging the family piano

Dale Smith
Bison Jerky

Up there Orion’s belt
Blinks out.
City of the Native
Chowdering like gimpy
  Sea Capt’ns.
Check it out
The sky’s seam splits
Angels and diablos
Squat in Details
Loaded Wall Street
Times Victoria’s
cotton funk.
Native pleasure: killing
Time.

I picked up copies of TINFISH the other day from the printer.  The =
covers are, literally, works of art--prints by Chris Churchill, who is =
from Hawai`i, and now studies at Cranbrook in Michigan.  They are =
absolutely gorgeous!  I had no idea (the art's not my department, as it =
were).

So, order your works of art WITH amazing poetry from the Pacific for a =
mere $8 each from TINFISH, Susan Schultz, editor, 47-728 Hui Kelu Street =
#9, Kaneohe, HI 96744.  You won't regret it.

Just wanted to correct one factual error in Jeffrey Jullich's report of my
White Box lecture.

My hair was most certainly not "moussed into standing."  That dramatic
spiking effect was achieved with "un colle sytlistique" [a styling glue]
from I.C.E. salon products.  I highly recommend it.  And it's waterproof.

Sincerely,

Based in Seoul, South Korea, the award-winning New Media work of YOUNG-HAE =

graphics, design, photos, illustrations, banners and colors to leave =
viewers with language and sound.

I. Rookie of the Year

Saw Chester Marcol walking through the
Little league parking lot with a kid in tow.
Twenty-plus years after leading the NFL
in scoring and vodka chugging.

He once lined up for a chip shot,
lined into the back of his center's head,
caught the ricochet on the fly, and stumbled into the end zone,
almost fumbling, but beating the hated Bears.

In the 1980s, wanting to end it all,he drank battery acid.
Helluva kick to it.

Gives speeches to the local high school kids now.
Works in a halfway house, got two kids and wife, lives in Dollar Bay.
I saw him under the Portage Lake Lift Bridge once, fishing.
(Stepdad Stan says he's always catching fish.)
Shook his hand and introduced my son, age 7, who said, "cool."

Seven years later, Chester still wears a Packers hat,
one of those shitty mesh-back numbers from Citgo.
But he's smiling, talking to his son,
pushing a lawn mower on the return trip past the park
where the potheads used to play Guts Frisbee every night.

Very Sad news indeed.

I'd like to take this opportunity to dedicate the panel I'm chairing on Bordieu
and contemporary American Poetry at the Louisville conference next month to his
memory.

STRIKE ME LIGHTNING

ACCLAIMED CHOREOGRAPHER SALLY SILVERS EXPLORES
PRIVATE LIVES OF NUNS & CYBORGS

Performances on Thursday February 7 through Sunday February 10 at P.S. 122 at 8:30 pm.

For reservations or more information call 212-477-5288 or visit www.ps122.org

Premiering on Thursday February 7th, P.S. 122 presents Sally Silvers & Dancers' STRIKE ME LIGHTNING. This new evening of dance, choreographed by Sally Silvers, takes the choreographic collision of nuns and cyborgs to its logical conclusion: a piece about confinement, fragmentation and ecstatic release, whether the body is cloistered or deliriously hybrid.

Welcome to the pearly gates of cyberspace, with Sally Silvers & Dancers embodying the disembodied. In STRIKE ME LIGHTNING, "cyborg-ness" casts a bizarre kinetic spell on nuns. Are these melded creatures of mystery fleshless â€” or can movement stage a secret life of thrills and fun? Careen back & forth along the fault lines:  between a new body politic for a vernacular posthuman future, and the vivid echoes of a baroque south-of-the border past like that of the 17th century Mexican nun & poet, Sor Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz. In a  saturanalia of dizzying rupture, ritual atomic swerves & turbulent betweens â€” as if "all the parts of my body were tongues" â€” get ready for prayerful proximity, miniaturized volcanic rumbles of form, and disheveled neurons in detail & delight. "Let the night have its way with you."

STRIKE ME LIGHTNING features sound design and text by Bruce Andrews, vocals by Haena Kim, toys and "knockabout electronics" by Dan Evans Farkas, box design by Bryan Hayes, costumes by Elizabeth Hope Clancy, and lights by David Fritz. With performances by a sizzling cast of dancers: Javier Cardona, Cynthia Fieldus, Amy Lee, Alejandra Martorell, Karen Sherman, and Sally Silvers.

The evening also features the premiere of a new collaborative duet with Sally Silvers and Keely Garfield, SAME DOLL SAME PLACE.

***

"An inventive, refreshing experimentalist... original, able to twist the
human body into quirks and shapes that telegraph an inherent kinetic wit. Her strong suit is the ability to convey an exciting emotional undercurrent beneath a cerebral formal structure."
- Anna Kisselgoff, The New York Times

"...among the most talented choreographers to emerge in the decade. Her vision is always true." - Mindy Aloff, Dance Magazine

"A genius for the unexpected. Exciting to discover wild-woman art so rich in formal, even classical values. Her strikingly original movement is richer in traditional values, like rhythmic and spatial variety than much traditional dance. ...strange, dark drama, kinky moves, fascinating dancing, lurid drama, complexity of vision" - Deborah Jowitt, The Village Voice


Sally Silvers has made more than 60 dances for herself and Sally Silvers & Dancers. She teaches improvisation, composition, and repertory both in the U.S. and abroad. Her writing, scores, and poetry have appeared in journals, literary magazines, and anthologies and she has co-directed 2 films. Her work has received support from the Jerome Foundation, NYFA, the Guggenheim Foundation, 6 times from the NEA, and twice from Meet the Composer/ Choreographer Project for collaborations with John Zorn and Bruce Andrews. She recently choreographed 3 musicals at the Sundance Theater Festival. And her work has just received support from The Fund for Contemporary Performance Arts.

It does, doesn't it. Unlawful combatants kidnapping people, putting them in
cages and accusing them of being unlawful combatants....

I know the story, tho I cld have sworn that when I read it the victim wasn't
told what he had done but was put in the machine which inscribed his
supposed *crime into him slowly with the idea that he would work out what
was being carved into him just before he died of it

In the real world nothing like that  would happen, of course. No, in the
real world, something would go bang and in all probability someone who has
never had the  money to buy a book will be torn to pieces without the time
to pray or say goodbye & thousands of miles away the video would be replayed
repeatedly to joyous exclamations

And at some point today I vaguely heard a report from somewhere in the real
world in which a USAmerican has been put in a cage with the intention that
he stay there until the kidnapped from Afghanistan are uncaged

How unexpected

Professor Dworkin:

Thank you.

I find ICE salon products at various web sites
(including a contest where you can vote for your
favorite ICE products, e.g.,

http://www.icehair.com/contest.html
http://www.spiralhaircase.com/ice.html
http://www.just4hair.com/ProductResults.asp?Category=22
http://www.west-coast-beauty.com/icejoico.html ,

etc.), but I am having trouble finding "un colle
sytlistique" (sic?) as they're all (mis?)translated
into English.

Could it possibly be called "Controller Styling"?



...And here I thought it was the voltage of your
ionized thoughts electrocuting the follicles into
verticality, . . . or the room turned upside and the
pull of gravidity.



(I wanted to be discrete on-List, but what really
cracked me up was all that talk about "rimming" in
Oppen.  What a card, what a card, what a card.

(And, out of respect and unsure of my steganography, I
backed off from including the sole factual error my
notes seemed to record:

(you said Saussure found hypogrammes in "classical
Latin poetry" [?!].  He found them in ~"Saturnian"~
Latin poetry, which was later.)



When I did my class presentation on Saussure and ~Mots
sous Mots~ in Sylvere Lotringer's Post-Structuralism
class, I asked him beforehand if it was okay for me to
pass around a copy of ~My Camarade,~ the transvestite
'zine: there was a ~tableau vivant~ photo-cartoon of
Miz Afrodite (sp?) in a simulated buffo orgy.  And, of
course, the correspondence to Saussure's search for
the hypogrammatic Aphrodite.


If you're ever in Manhattan and feel like a carbonated
beverage or some date rape drugs, . . .

Sincerely,

Huge thanks go out to all the performers, directors, and writers who made
last Friday's installment of Poets Theater Jubilee so fantastic. The
production of Leslie Scalapino's How Phenomena Appear to Unfold/The Hind
was a visual and auditory feast. And all the short plays after were
superb, every one. Thanks to writers Tina Darragh, Dan Farrell, Brent
Cunningham, Laura Moriarty, Chris Vitiello, Stephen Beachy, and Eileen
Myles for an evening that felt very space age, very philosophically, very
funny, and which also reminded me of the agitprop 80s, we had George Jr
represented as a hamster and as a tree!

first, thanks to all who responded to my questions about ts eliot and
the objectivists respectively.
now, here's another:
who was it who wanted to make the world safe for democracy?  woodrow
wilson?  i'm curious about the source of anne waldman's signature
commitment to "make the world safe for poetry."

As you say, from the account: Jeffrey Jullich did a god job (as it is hard
to get the full import of a lecture into a single "report") and Dworkin
sounds interesting (if quite possibly...well he's a theorist...) but to take
the issue of Bishop's poem it is a very remote possibility of a connection
and of course this could be an example of "one" reading ... this encoding in
of names goes back to Zukofsky and even as far back as Bach ( from whom
Zukofsy's ideas possibly ) ... and even the Oulippo but eg one senses the
aura of impish play at play (another "reading") with eg Perec and maybe
Dworkin: my guess is that the subject of Dworkin's hair will become central
to his whole concept of coded meaning or un-meaning: the fact that is was
moussed (he is now denying this which possibly introduces a secret
coding...a political-phikosophic aspect..) or demoused introduces an element
of erotic "faime" into the whole discussion..especially when we consider
that Bishop's marvellous poem was about a mouse, not a mouse, or mousse:
strange surreal and mysterious as her poems are so lodged as they are in the
non-meaning of reality's irreality.
  Certainly Dworkin uses a lot of long words.  But it was interesting...but
today I have some more dental treatment (the dentist is a female! and an
Iraqi!!!  Allah help me!) so I will ortho dont my donts (donts) dents .. I
dont want too much reality: pain, _pain_ (g r it in me dents) or
misadventure, ad nor will I be ard or of great wealth: but a bit of real
toading in unreal gnomies might be ok. And when the reality has subsided i
can study how to un-island my isole....What am I talking about? I swear I'm
sober. (Not _ sobre_). Richard.

It was Wilson

but he bungled it....

Interestingly, it was Wilson & Lenin both who propounded the idea of
self-determination at this same time. No concept has done more to reify
borders (and border battles). The number of "nations" has doubled since
then, and is apt to double again during my children's lifetime. And for
every border an army....

For those on this list who are scratching their heads about Tom's 2nd
"Breakfast Comix" strip: probably most listmembers here aren't regular
readers of _Poetry Review_, the UK's "official" poetry organ (published by
the Poetry Society). I thought I'd paste in the below, a letter that
appeared there by David Harsent.  It's in reply to three letters (by me,
Stephen Waling & Tony Frazer) that appeared in the previous issue, which
were responses in turn to a particularly nasty hatchet-job on Keith Tuma's
OUP anthology by Sean O'Brien (the review may be found by going to my
website, linked to below, & heading to the bibliography of reviews, which
links to the pertinent page on the PoSoc's site).  Anyway, FYI. -- all

BIZZARRO

Dear Editor,

Those who wrote to complain of Sean O'Brien's review of Keith Tuma's
anthology missed the point. It's not a question of whether there should be
more dialogue between a nebulous mainstream and an even more shadowy
neoModernism, or tolerance on both sides, or even intermarriage. No one is
going to be found strolling across the DMZ - prompted by some sort of
palefaced aesthetic pacifism - with a smile, a Red Cross parcel and an
agreement to differ, because there's simply too much at stake.

An anthology isn't worth much unless it has a point of view, and Keith
Tuma's book certainly has one; however he seems less eager to start a
critical debate than to secure political gains by stealth. The book's length
and title suggest the sort of allinclusive job that civilians give as
Christmas gifts, while the swot's footnotes mark it out as a book for
student beginners; so, at first glance, it might appear to offer an
uncontroversial guide to British and Irish poetry best suited to readers
with little knowledge of the subject.

This stands at odds, though, with Tuma's battling introduction, where he
states ".I think that this anthology has considerable value in offering a
picture of British and Irish poetry unlike any other picture available."
(Read on and you'll know why.) He goes on to suggest, with no small amount
of hubris, that he is providing British poetry (Irish seems to slip out at
this point in his argument) with the chance to make all impression on an
American reading public which has, "over the last two decades", found it to
be "hardly... a raging concern".

This, it seems, is the fault of British poetry for languishing in its
booklined study, content with not having "...broken through the barriers of
basically conventional virtuosity since [Dylan] Thomas". These are not
Tuma's words, but he quotes them approvingly as a shorthand way of
highlighting British poetry's shortcomings. Not only is this nonsense and,
in any case, makes a watershed of a body of work the worth of which is very
much up for debate, it also proposes a value-system which manages to be both
vague and tyrannical. Tuma's rescue operation, it appears, is more or less
dependent on certain contemporary British poets who have been ignored by
their peers. Tuma fogs the issue very slightly by including one or two poets
of genuine worth, but his protégés are by far the majority and make
themselves known to us willingly enough: the fractured syllable, the glib
obfuscation, the tin ear, the random wordsearch. Poets (we're told) who have
properly absorbed the lesson of Modernism. They alone (though with Tuma's
imprimatur) will persuade American readers, academics, critics, that there's
a jot or two of worth in British poetry. O'Brien characterises these poets
as "postimaginative"; so would I: the point being that, for many of them,
poetry itself seems oddly redundant, if poetry has anything to do with
talent, vision or seriousness.

The reason that Tuma's natural opponents are unlikely to want to enter into
all exchange of views (or whatever it is politicians do) is because there's
nothing to talk about. The work at issue doesn't warrant it. To call them
Modernist or experimental doesn't provide them with credentials; there's no
terminological umbrella that will keep the critical rain off this bunch of
nohopers.

Yours sincerely,

If you breathe a living word of this I don't know what I'll do. You can't
spread hearsay. This must be absolutely confidential. Because it's our
secret and has to remain that way. No one ever must know this. I'm holding
you to the utmost, Nikuko, absolutely to the utmost. This must be the
limits of our lives and we must not open our mouths under any conditions
at all, Nikuko.

I will break you in pieces if you breathe a word of this to anyone. You
must take this to the grave. You most promise not to say anything. Nikuko,
there is no way out. This is strictly between you and me. No one else has
anything to do with it. No one else can find out anything. Don't leave the
tiniest little clue anywhere or breathe the tiniest little sigh. All the
walls have mouths and all the doors have ears, Nikuko.

I'd rather you fuck me until we drop, rather than reveal a single word of
this. I'd rather you kill me slowly. I'd rather you'd prepare our meals,
rather than discuss this with any of our friends or acquaintances. This is
never to be disclosed, Nikuko, it is our hot breath together, whispered
from one mouth to one ear and listened to by one ear from one mouth. It is
not to be ever spoken of to anyone. It is to be confined between just the
two of us, as if it were in a perfect penitentiary we have made just for
this secret, like Speer in prison.

No one else can know a thing about this, not the tiniest little thing. I
am swearing you to secrecy and myself to secrecy. This can go no further,
not even to our closest friends and relatives. Absolutely, the sweat on
our skins is our absolute bond that we have made between us so no one will
ever have the slightest inkling of this, ever. Even if we fuck and our
sweats intermingle as you prepare our meals, our sweats must not drip and
be interpreted as the most microscopic clue that ever has been left, even
tinier than the smallest fragment of dna, Nikuko, even tinier than the
smallest hydrogen atom in the littlest orbit ever.

Trees would fall and mountains collapse if anyone says anything; this is
the most top top-secret of all the secrets, this is locking us together
forever, there is nothing anyone can give you that would make you reveal
this secret. Not even valleys flooding or great storms would make you
reveal this secret, which is only hearsay and should not be spread
indiscriminately among one and all. Not even fire or whole world wars of
incredible conflagration shall make us give up even one syllable of this
to any living creature, including animals and plants and minerals, or any
other thing or place or emanation on this or any other planet.

Nothing can ever ever be revealed, disclosed, opened up, Nikuko, brought
into the light, given up to the full view, nothing whatsoever, and this
for all time, even past our deaths and internments, even past our
exhumations and reburials, nothing at all.

Geat stuff: loved Raworth's work since I saw his work in the Pengui poetry
series. And there's clearly a fierce philosophico-politico debate invading
the heights and depths of British society at all levels.  The boiled egg and
breakfast on a tray, though, thank the lord, live on in my England... In the
"Finnegan's Wake" one I'm not sure who to pity most: Bush or the Pope!
Eliot's got a cunning smile and it looks as tho Yeats is just (edgily) out
of range of a possible right hook by Eliot who would shout over his downed
rival: "Got you, you fairy lover!".  Good fun. Apreciated, Richard.

here's the thing; dworkin doesn't ahve to be *right*, he just has to be
interesting and provocative.  from jullich's report, it sounded so.  i love
weird stuff like that.  wouldn't *you* get excited if you discovered a way
to track down names in texts?

I've just learned via Ken Warren's magazine _House Organ_ that Fielding
Dawson died on January 5,2002.

Fielding was a terrific writer and a good friend.  He had a remarkable
ability to cut through to the emotional heart of a situation.

The first time I read at the Ear Inn in NYC he generously came to hear me.
He'd walked through a wintry drizzle from his place on East 19th Street.  He
was beaming as he told me-- "I do my best thinking in the rain."

I love his writing.  I loved the man.  He will be missed.

"Even more than the problem of the re-inscription of the author's name,
what strikes me as disturbing about Dworkin's approach (by this account) is
its appearance of objective empiricism, as though this content (any
content) is patently "there" in the text, rather than immanent in the
social transaction.  That these names, or dental records or what have you,
are part of an "unwritten core," rather than a manifest content, sounds
like logical positivism in a deconstructive guise.  But, had it all been
presented in a spirit of play (viz Garrett Stewart hearing an unspoken
"love" in Keats's "the fee/l of/ not to feel it") it might have been more
compelling."


This reminds me of Max Naenny, and others in Europe, who work on "iconicity
in language and literature."  Iconicity is difficult to demonstrate
semiotically, I think, but one interesting thing about it is how it's often
empirically incomplete, i.e. more metaphysical/rhetorical than
physical/empirical.

If you say, for example, that in a particular Williams poem a stanza is an
icon of a tree and this icon can structure or inform a possible
interpretation of the stanza and poem, you might very well produce an
interesting interpretation, but still not prove the existence of the icon
on empirical grounds.  Somebody can still say, "I don't see the tree," or,
"that isn't a tree; it's a radio tower."  This seems to show, somewhat
ironically, that the icon doesn't "matter" in a literal, empirical sense in
the same way, or have the same value, as it does in a figurative and
rhetorical sense.  These values line up when everything is persuasively
"there," but this probably shows how the suggestion of an icon, or
iconicity in general, can function as a rhetorical topic more than anything
else.

For those interested, Max Naenny has a web site at
http://www.es.unizh.ch/iconicity/.

Hi Pierre

I recall, when young, being fascinated by the life-stories of some poets,
usually of a romantic kind (the Romantic poets themselves of course excite
such an interest, yet not too interested in others) But often when one means
an interest in the biography it might only be of 'high points'. I've just
been reading a rare treat - a 'biography' of Henry Vaughan, tho' much of the
slender volume is commentary of the poems, as the known detail of Vaughan's
life, tho' reasonable for a writer of his time, is quite little. But it was
quite interesting to get a picture of Vaughan as a sometimes touchy,
Royalist, precursor of holistic medicine living in a crowded home with
successive wives who were sisters and a cantankerous debt-ridden father in a
locality his peers thought obscure but he was devoted to. Who was a Doctor
of Medicine who possibly never was accredited and spent part of his last
years quarrelling with some of his children.

And who didn't know precisely where the twin brother he was so elegiac about
was buried.

But it was possibly interesting as a fiction!

Best

Does anyone have knowledge of any interesting readings, events, performances

interesting things are likely to happen?

hi groovoids --and thanks to chris pusateri, damian rollinson and ron
silliman who answered the woodrow wilson question --here's another, from
film history:

what's the provenance of the metro-goldwyn-mayer lion's roar logo: what
were its intended semiotics and when/how did it originate?  i am looking at
trungpa rinpoche's "lion's roar" statement, that "no state of mind is
unworkable" in terms of anne waldman's poethics.

thanks ron, speaking of poultry, i used to work at wessex used books in
menlo park, and we received a shipment of remaindered books entitled
_Robert Frost, Poultry Farmer._  it was for real.  and what's even funnier,
when i came back a coupla years after having left the area for this job,
they had sold them all.  I shouldn't be so uppity; maybe the author of that
book is on this listserv.

Contemporary Art Exploring Language and Form
On View at Yale Art Gallery

An exhibition of works by contemporary artists interested in the ways=20
language and visual form express human experience will be shown at the Yale=
=20
University Art Gallery from January 29 through March 30, 2002.

"Between Language and Form" comprises thirty works, ranging from artist=20
books to mixed media sculpture and paintings on canvas by John Baldessari,=
=20
Johanna Drucker, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Roni Horn, Joseph Kosuth, Jonathan=20
Lasker, Tan Lin, Angela Lorenz, Stephana McClure, Bruce Nauman, Claes=20
Oldenburg, Kay Rosen, Keith Smith, Richard Tuttle, Lawrence Weiner, and=20
Christopher Wool. The exhibition, organized by Jennifer Gross, the Seymour=
=20
H. Knox, Jr. Curator of European and Contemporary Art, complements the=20
concurrent exhibitions The Tiger=92s Eye: The Art of a Magazine and The 1948=
=20
Directors of the Soci=E9t=E9 Exhibition.

The use of language in visual art has a long tradition  hieroglyphics in=20
Egyptian art, calligraphy in Chinese and Islamic art, and medieval=20
illuminated manuscripts. In the twentieth century, as Ms. Gross points out=
=20
in the brochure accompanying the exhibition, =93it is in the early synthetic=
=20
works of Braque and Picasso that the elements of language first surfaced in=
=20
the visual field with a modernist consciousness; that is as a means to=20
understand how painting articulates itself or how signification resides on=
=20
the surface of the picture plane.=94
  After the Second World War poets such as Ian Hamilton Finlay, who is=20
represented in this exhibition, took typographical control of their works=20
creating what is known as =93concrete poetry.=94 An example of Angela=
 Lorenz=92s=20
experimentation in this field is Lay Text, a book with latex pages that=20
stretch revealing the hidden meanings between the letters on the page below.

In another medium, Roni Horn, inspired by the life and poetry of Emily=20
Dickinson, has created a work, How Dickinson Stayed Home, that sets the=20
phrase =93My business is circumference=94 into machined aluminum blocks=20
scattered across the floor. The viewer may step around and through=20
Dickinson=92s 2002 presence. Other issues of articulation and communication=
=20
are addressed by Kay Rosen and Jonathan Lasker in their paintings.  Among=20
the numerous artist books on display, a highlight is Reading Red, a=20
collaboration between artist Richard Tuttle and poet Charles Bernstein.

On Thursday, February 7 at 5:30 pm, Johanna Drucker, director of media=20
studies at the University of Virginia and a well-known creator of and=20
authority on artist books, will give a lecture on =93The Artist and the=20
Written Word,=94 the second in the Lydia Winston Malbin Lecture Series.

On Tuesday, February 19, at 2:00 pm, Jennifer Gross, the curator of Between=
=20

THE TIGER=92S EYE: The Art of a Magazine
Opens January 29 at the Yale Art Gallery

The Intention of The Tiger=92s Eye is to be a bearer of ideas and art. In=
 the=20
belief that art is a quest that can be good only as water is good, there is=
=20
no wish to reach for a halo of GOOD, which is a prudish proud ambition. It=
=20
places its dependence, instead, on ingenuous and ingenious artists and=20
writers, whoever and wherever they are, as they move through the dimension=
=20
of curiosity=85. The selection of material will be based on these questions.=
=20
Is it alive? Is it valid as art? How brave is the originality? How does it=
=20
enter the imagination?
--Editorial Statement, The Tiger=92s Eye, Number 1, October 1947

The Tiger=92s Eye, a strikingly presented, widely read, and lastingly=20
influential magazine of art and literature, was published in nine quarterly=
=20
issues from 1947 to 1949 by Ruth and John Stephan. Seldom has a publication=
=20
captured so inclusively the vibrant creativity and spirit of a period, one=
=20
in which the center of the art world shifted from Paris to New York, and=20
European modernism was giving way to the new American abstraction. The=20
impressive quality of visual art in the nine issues of this magazine is the=
=20
subject of The Tiger=92s Eye: The Art of a Magazine, on view at the Yale=20
University Art Gallery from January 29 through March 30, 2002.

The exhibition brings together for the first time approximately sixty works=
=20
of art -- paintings, sculpture, and works on paper  by Tiger=92s Eye=
 artists.=20
The names of those whose work is in the exhibition is an indication of how=
=20
distinguished and wide-ranging the list of contributors was:  Milton Avery,=
=20
Louise Bourgeois, Constantin Brancusi, Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Delvaus,=20
Jean Dubuffet, Antonio Frasconi, Herbert Ferber, Alberto Giacometti, Adolph=
=20
Gottlieb, Stanley Hayter, Ian Hugo, Loren McIver, Ezio Martinelli, Andr=E9=
=20
Masson, Jo=E1n Mir=F3, Maud Morgan, Walter Murch, Pablo Picasso, Andr=E9=
 Racz,=20
Bernard Reder, Odilon Redon, Ad Reinhardt, Christian Rohlfs , Mark Rothko,=
=20
Anne Ryan, Kay Sage, Louis Schanker, Karl Schrag, Kurt Schwitters, Kurt=20
Seligmann, Theodoros Stamos, John Stephan, Clyfford Still, Rufino Tamayo,=20
Mark Tobey, and Steve Wheeler. Multiple copies of the magazine will also be=
=20
displayed.

  =93Hundreds of so-called little magazines were published in English in the=
=20
first half of the twentieth century,=94 noted Pamela Franks, the Florence B.=
=20
Selden Fellow at the Yale Art Gallery and curator of the exhibition. =93=
 They=20
were experimental, idealistic, and usually reached a small, intellectual=20
readership. The Tiger=92s Eye was one of the few that took visual art as=20
seriously as literature. Thanks to the generosity of private and=20
institutional collectors,=94 she added, =93 we have been able to assemble a=
=20
substantial selection of the original works and look through The Tiger=92s=
=20
Eye into the art world of the late 1940s.=94

Ruth Walgreen Stephan, a poet, and her husband John Stephan, a painter,=20
published the first issue of the magazine The Tiger=92s Eye in October,=20
1947.  Despite their lack of publishing experience, they were justifiably=20
confident in their ability to launch such an ambitious enterprise having,=20
in addition to their own creative gifts, a wide acquaintance among both=20
established and avant-garde writers and artists who were potential=20
contributors. Furthermore Ruth Stephan, the daughter of drugstore magnate=20
Charles Walgreen, was heir to a considerable fortune and able to finance=20
not only the magazine=92s publication but also their travels, to Europe and=
=20
South America for example, in search of material.
The magazine=92s title comes from The Tyger by William Blake (1757-1827),=20
which begins

Tyger, tyger, burning bright / In the forest of the night/
What immortal hand or eye / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

Blake=92s methods in the production of his Illuminated Books further=
 inspired=20
them and they researched his technique for guidance in their own=20
publication. Indeed, the creative process was a major focus of the Stephans=
=20
and the artists who collaborated with them. As Ruth Stephan explained to=20
the art historian Meyer Schapiro, The Tiger=92s Eye would be =93an aesthetic=
=20
magazine publishing poetry, essays, fiction, drawings and reproductions of=
=20
paintings, and we are also interested in the paths artists and writers have=
=20
used towards creation of their art.=94 To this end, artists=92 ideas were=20
frequently presented in proximity to images of their work. For example,=20
issue number 4, devoted to sculpture, featured twenty-two objects by as=20
many sculptors, with texts by fourteen of the artists, including a=20
particularly revealing piece by Giacometti.  Sculptures by three of these=20
artists are in the exhibition.

A striking feature of the magazine was the separation of authors=92 and=20
artists=92 names from their work, forcing the reader, as the poet William=20
Carlos Williams wrote, =93to make actual and immediate sense contacts with=
=20
the work of art.=94 Contributors were credited in the =93Tale of the=
 Contents=94=20
located in the center of each magazine and, as Williams pointed out,=20
=93Everyone instinctively looks to see the name first so that they may know=
=20
how to feel. If the name is all right they can relax and enjoy without=20
danger of committing a --- clumsiness, to say the least. Without the name=20
they would be lost. We are all a little that way.=94 Readers of the book=20
accompanying this exhibition are able to experience this =93immediate sense=
=20
contact,=94 since the art is reproduced without captions and the artists=92=
=20
names and object titles are listed separately.

While the exhibition does not attempt to replicate the subject matter of=20
each of the nine issues of The Tiger=92s Eye, many of its themes and=20
juxtapositions are introduced. John Stephan=92s covers for the magazine  two=
=20
paintings and a drawing  begin the exhibition. Six of the twelve paintings=
=20
by Mark Rothko reproduced in the magazine, are grouped together. An Ad=20
Reinhardt painting is juxtaposed with one by Paul Delvaux, just as it was=20
in the issue on =93The Sublime.=94 A comprehensive group of works reproduced=
 in=20
issue number 8, devoted to the graphic arts, is displayed and other themes=
=20
addressed.

The abundantly illustrated book, The Tiger=92s Eye: The Art of a Magazine,=
=20
written by Pamela Franks, pays homage to the design of the magazine in its=
=20
size  10 =BC  x 7 =BC inches-- and aesthetic sensibility. The author=
 recounts=20
the history, discusses the goals and philosophy of the editors and=20
contributors, and the reasons for its =93untimely demise.=94 It is available=
 in=20
the museum store in softcover for $29.95.

The project was made possible by generous loans from numerous individual=20
collectors and institutions, among them the Museum of Modern Art, New York,=
=20
the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, the Addison Gallery of=20
American Art, Andover, Massachusetts, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the=20
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. It is supported=
=20
by the Florence B. Selden Endowment and donations from Mrs. John Stephan,=20
the David T. Langrock Foundation,   Susan Morse Hilles, and an anonymous=
 donor.

not clear on problematics of self-determination and how that's supposed to
be a bad thing or cause nations.  way prior lenin etc., condorcet
introduces idea of "self-determined rational educator."  and, if the
rational is real (the real being emergent necessity per historical process,
per hegel) the rational educator is the educator coming into being as
historically required.

no?  let's have a pizza, a bourbon.

Well, I didn't scratch my head over them but I wished
I could recognize the actors. That would have added an
extra layer for me. I liked the speech bubbles but
I've never seen any of those people before so I didn't
really "get" the comics.
Best wishes,

There's a wonderful English language bookstore called, of all things, The
Village Voice that regularly offers readings, often by Black American
expatriate poets.  It's located on the Left Bank (of course) a few blocks
from the St. Germain des Pres (the church) on the other side of the avenue.
I've been there several times so it's strange that I forget the name of the
rue.  But it's easy to find.  Best, Bill

The Germ & Poetic Research Bureau (Western Office) present:

McDaniel, Stroffolino and Bang!

Superbowl Sunday, 4pm at Dawsons Book Shop.

***

If, as Donne said, variety is the sweetest part of love, than I've the
maraschino share for you this weekend, Zicklein! This is a bit like that
episode of the Twilight Zone where the ballerina, the hobo, the clown and
the bagpiper are thrown together in a half-lit cylinder and have to build a
human ladder to get out. Of course it was only a toy donation barrel, not
the paneled pleasure pokey that is Dawsons Book Shop, but we haunt our
hoosegows where we must. Standing in for the ballerina this Sunday, dancing
as 'fantast' as she can, is the wizardess from the Midwest, Mary Jo Bang,
whose poems have the same sort of "uncomfortably dreamy" sensibility of
Ravel's L'Enfant et les Sortileges, where objects animate to spank badboy
readers across the midbrain. Playing our lonesome tramp is LA's own
rhetor-outlaw Jeff McDaniel, who hurls the Traum-speak of an American-me
through a mental megaphone as bully as Broadway. And our heroic harlequin is
none other than Chris Stroffolino, shadow boxer in a Moebius ring, a punchy
Keaton bust-up who, like any sacred clown worth his holey boots, knows that
a poet can't be a supe without being a dupe, and that loop-de-loop is the
fundamental play in the game.

And your Irish tooter? That's me, pals, the piping plover of Larchmont.
Consider me your pocket John Madden, though this is no pre-show mumble. We
got game to lose, and this ain't a super-dud lock. Will our characters crawl
out of the toybox and into the light? And what if that light is you, fair
audience, will you provide?

February 3, Sunday 4pm

Mary Jo Bang is poetry editor for the Boston Review. Her poetry collections
include Apology for Want (Middlebury/Breadloaf 1997), Louise in Love (Grove
Press, 2001) and Downstream Extremity of the Isle of Swans (University of
Georgia, 2001). Individual poems have appeared in Jacket, The Nation, and
The New Yorker among others venues. She teaches literature at Washington
University in St. Louis.

Chris Stroffolino is the author of, most recently, Spin Cycle (Spuyten
Duyvil, 2001), a collection of essays from 1989-2001, Light as a Fetter
(Situations Press, 1997) and Stealer's Wheel  (Lingo Book Series, 1999).
Along with Lisa Jarnot and Leonard Schwartz, he is co-editor of An Anthology
of New (American) Poets, which was published in 1998. He lives in Oakland,
where he teaches at Saint Mary's College.

Jeffrey McDaniel is the author of Alibi School (Manic D, 1995) and The
Forgiveness Parade (Manic D, 1998). Much-loved local performance poet, his
work has appeared in Poetry Nation and The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry.

Well, what a lot of people dont know is that Robert Frost ... I mean _the_
Robert Frost  (code for literary disaster ie as is well known..one can be
"frosted out" etc cf Craig Dworkins - the US's reply to Baudelaire (of the
green hair and flanair extraordinnaire), was in fact not Robert Frost but a
chicken farmer .. as come to think of it was Himmler, but that has no
relevance to the discussion at this stage...) and in fact wrote brilliant
poems about walls and a spider on a leaf and a hand being cut off etc...but
he was first and foremost a chicken farmer and wanted to remain unknown
whereas the other Robert Frost..any way he sent his poems to RF and it all
worked out wonderfully. Richard.

BlankFielding Dawson
24 January 2002


Guy Fielding Lewis Dawson, writer, artist and teacher: born New York 2
August 1930; died New York 5 January 2002.

In 1984 Fielding Dawson, in Buffalo for three days as writer-in-residence,
was asked to teach a workshop at Attica Maximum Security Prison. The
experience, he said, politicised him and changed his life, and for the next
17 years he taught in prisons, in women's shelters, in alternative high
schools, until his last class at Sing Sing in December.

"Fee" Dawson was born in New York City in 1930 and moved to Kirkwood,
Missouri, when he was eight. At 15, his mother, saying that the world
needed a new Saroyan, gave him a portable typewriter and some paper. His
memoir of growing up there, Tiger Lilies: an American childhood (1984) was
noted as "a book of singular beauty and literary distinction" by the critic
Edmund Fuller.

After studying portrait drawing with Tanasko Milovich and taking a few
classes at Washington University Art School in St Louis, Dawson moved to
rural North Carolina in 1949 to attend Black Mountain College, where his
teachers and fellow-students included Charles Olson, Franz Kline, Stefan
Wolpe, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Creeley, Jonathan Williams,
Cy Twombly, Paul Goodman, John Chamberlain and Edward Dorn.

Dawson wrote, "Black Mountain worked: we made a potent little mandala in an
archaic valley in the Blue Ridge Mountains to be felt long into the
future", and his The Black Mountain Book (1970) is the only work about the
college written by someone who was there. In 1953 he was drafted, with
non-combatant status, and served as an army cook at a Military Hospital
near Heidelberg. He returned to New York City in 1956.

Continuing his friendship with painters met at Black Mountain, Dawson drank
with them at the famous Cedar Bar. An Emotional Memoir of Franz Kline
(1967), a remarkable book, conveys in an intimate way an intense feeling of
that time, while showing the daily lives of Kline, Pollock, the De
Koonings, Guston and others in an affectionate but clear light. From his
high-school days in Missouri Dawson had kept an enthusiasm for baseball,
bringing his pitching skills to the city where he was a regular in the
Sunday afternoon artists' softball games along with the writers Joel
Oppenheimer, Amiri Baraka, Paul Blackburn and Gil Sorrentino: later he
pitched for the Max's Kansas City team.

In the early 1960s Dawson's prose was widely published in magazines both in
the United States and abroad. His first book in the UK was Thread (with a
collage cover by the author) from Andrew Crozier's Ferry Press in 1964. The
pieces were generally short, often less than a page in length; but the
flickers of mood and tone, the fragments of dialogue, their confidence in
the reader's capacity to assume and infer, illuminated worlds much larger.
Robert Creeley wrote: "I have never seen a writer capable of such fast
shifts, so instantly, nervously exact." By the early 1970s their influence
could be detected in the work of younger writers such as Stephen Emerson
and Dale Herd.

In 1990 Larry McMurtry, then Pen (USA) President, appointed Dawson chair of
the Pen Prison Writing Committee and his enthusiastic promotion of this
almost moribund group gave it renewed energy and brought in many new
members. For six years, from 1994, he hosted a weekly radio programme,
Breaking Down the Walls, on WBAI New York, broadcasting prisoners' writings
and dealing with issues of incarceration. His most recent book of stories,
The Land of Milk & Honey (2001), reflects these experiences in both style
and content.

Fielding Dawson wrote more than 20 volumes of short stories, novels,
memoirs and poems. In 1969 Krazy Kat / The Unveiling and Other Stories
1951-1968 was the first of many books of his to be published by Black
Sparrow Press during the next 30 years. He produced essays, art and
literary criticism, catalogues for exhibitions, gave readings, and
frequently taught at colleges and universities. Continuing his graphic
work, he created logos and covers for many important small press editions
from the 1950s onwards, usually illustrated his own books, and was
exhibited in galleries throughout the US. His last show, new works
combining word and image, was at the Jack Tilton Gallery in New York last
September.

"He was different in that he came across as happy a lot of the time,
notwithstanding all kinds of things. I think of a guy with a big smile
saying THAT'S TERRIFIC with stress on both words, and doing that twitchy
thing with his eyes," Steve Emerson wrote to me last week.

I'm sitting here in our hundred year old house that is empty but for me and
the dog.  My wife's working late.  My youngest daughter's working her part
time gig.  My oldest daughter is married now and in graduate school in
Boston. Left over stir fry is growing limp on the stove. I'm feeling lonely
and drinking wine and thinking intently about Dawson's _An Emotional Memoir
of Franz Kline_.  It's a book I've read several times, though the last time
was several years ago. My copy's a first edition with a tattered and much
abused dust jacket . I've been lugging it from address to address for more
than 30 years. It is, in many respects, my favorite of his books.  That may
be partly due to the fact that it was the first or one of the first of his
books that I read.

Sometime in the early seventies when I was an undergraduate at Kent State,
Robert Berthoff (sp?, sorry) instigated a creative arts festival that
included, among other things,
(many other things/people-a Michael McClure play (_Spider Rabbit_), Harvey
Bialy, etc--and this at a time when Ed Dorn was poet in residence!), a
reading by Creeley and Dawson in University Auditorium.  I went to see
Creeley--and, shit, I dug him (he read from the Daybook, I think) but Dawson
had me enthralled. He read a couple short stories, even sang Danny Boy at one
point.  I went back to the dorm and pounded out a short story that night.
God, the man made me want to write.

When I spoke with Creeley a few months ago after his reading at Kent State I
told him that this was only the 2nd time I'd heard him read in person, that
the 1st time had been back in the seventies with Fielding at Univ. Aud.
Creeley said that during the festival they'd both been really drunk at one
point and that he'd awakened to that fact that Fielding was peeing on his
shoes.  Life is strange and wonderful.

but isn't that the point: not to prove the "tree" is "there," but to
produce an interesting reading?  and if someone disagrees and produces and
interesting counter-reading, so much the better, no?

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

an afternoon reading with
CLAUDIA KEELAN & LIZ WALDNER

Thursday February 7, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

CLAUDIA KEELAN is the author of three books of poetry:  Refinery (Cleveland
State, 1994), The Secularist (Georgia, 1997), and most recently Utopic
(Alice James Books, 2000, winner of the Beatrice Hawley Award).  Claudia
Keelan lives in Las Vegas, where she teaches at the University of Nevada.

Alice Notley writes of Utopic:  "These are beautiful, anguished political
poems.  They emerge from a Southern past, and a Western desert present in
whose palpable solitude Keelan writes for both herself and the many.
Utopic is an unanticipated accomplishment."

LIZ WALDNER's books include Homing Devices (O Books, 1998), A Point Is That
Which Has No Part (U Iowa, 2000, winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize and
Academy of American Poets Laughlin Prize), and Self and Simulacra (Alice
James, Beatrice Hawley Award winner 2001).  Etym(bi)ology (Omnidawn), and
Dark would (the missing person) (Georgia) are both forthcoming in 2002.
She lives in Seattle.

"Liz Waldner is a poet of high wit, high intelligence, and great musical
rigor-she may be our Postmodern Metaphysical poet plummeting deeper and
deeper with each book into the questions of self, sexuality, and knowing."
