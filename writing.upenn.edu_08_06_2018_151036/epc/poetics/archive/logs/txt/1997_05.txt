One time, when I was sitting at a front table by myself at an Ayler
Brothers gig, Rashied Ali was drumming so fast he let slip a stick and I
caught it on one bounce off the floor, and gave it back to him after the
(55 minute) piece. Damn. I shda kept it, eh?

Sort of an upfront, in-your-face cultural gesture?  (Or like the Peruvians
who wear the soul's indicia about the circumference of the hat?  [Vide
Eduardo Galeano, *Memory of Fire,* re: the latter.])  When the subject
becomes all, the message becomes superfluous.  When all is topic,
comment can idle away the time chewin' the fat & shootin' the breeze.
When all is formulaic in the "when all" manner, the conclusion is
precisely like this.

In certain cultures, the subject is veiled.  Then (by way of revolutionary
gesture, out of bordom, in quest of novelty, or for love of candor), the
tables turn.  To turn the tabale, lift from anywhere along surfaces A and
B simultaneously, with the proviso that due coordination is requisite.
Turntables are CDed eventually, but that's a whole nother alterety [a
word for which my spellchecker suggests "altered"].  Arguendo, all is
arguendo, from rover to romeo, from breadbox to brickbat.  Sea and
season: the father, here, is the mother.  The ship hath not a sale.  By their
CDs shall ye know them.

** Please note ** A couple of people have suggested that I should post this
on Poetics. I've decided to do so, but only the more relevant bits. I can
send the complete thing (there isn't too much more) to anyone asking for it
back-channel. The complete 'review,' such as it is, will be mounted on the
web by the _electronic book review_ in mid-May. The exact URL is not yet
available.

And *hey* I've, personally, got poetics set to 'nomail' at the moment, and
will not turn the daily digest back on until the end of May, so fi I don't
respond to postings on the list, please forgive me, but my text fields
overfloweth....


[Apologies: This is not a 'balanced' review of the Hypertext '97
conference, but only, as Ted Nelson would put it, one particular, packaged,
'point of view'. I haven't named all the names I should have or even many
and I have not explicitly acknowledged the herculean efforts of the many
organizers. Readers are referred to the full published conference
proceedings, _The Eighth ACM Conference on Hypertext_, edited by Mark
Bernstein, Leslie Carr and Casper Osterbye, New York: ACM, 1997. My
perspective is that of a practitioner of literary cybertext. This piece was
written quickly as draft towards a (probably shorter) review of the
conference which is to be published in the UK-based periodical (presently a
quarterly newspaper) of 'digitalartcritique' entitled _Mute_ (and
web-posted as part of the _electronic book review_). I would be very
grateful for any suggestions, comments or corrections. It won't be edited
or finalized for some time. With thanks in anticipation, John Cayley]

'The King is dead, long live the King,' was the challenging title of John
B. Smith's opening keynote address at Hypertext '97. It was especially
contentious given the animated and perpetually stimulating presence of Ted
Nelson, uncrowned Emperor of an expanding (ballooning?) Docuverse. From
April 6-11, the University of Southampton, where there is a strong
tradition of hypertext research, hosted the eighth international conference
of the Hypertext research community since its first official meeting ten
years ago, chaired by this year's opening speaker. The conference convenes
under the auspices of the ACM, or Association for Computing Machinery, a
no-nonsense umbrella organization offering support and accreditation for
the activities of over 80,000 IT professionals and students worldwide. The
papers given were strictly refereed, yet there was an air of openness,
excitement and innovation which may be a function of hypertext's
substantive engagement with intellectual and cultural 'emergencies' (its
apparent structural homologies with critical theory, for example), or more
practically, because the conference proper had been proceeded by open
workshops and tutorials, or because there were live demos of new systems,
or because there has, traditionally, been a strong literary thread to
hypertext programmes, or simply because those visionary ironies instilled
in us by a certain living 'literary machine' have not faded.

Clearly, Smith, from the University of North Carolina, was primarily
concerned with the relationship between the hypertext (research) community
and the parallel or splintered groupings more recently clustered around the
World Wide Web. The great irony is, that if the (non-specialist) wired
masses recognize the word 'hypertext' at all this is because the Web has
popularized an actually existing technology which realizes vital but
limited hypertextual potentialities, whereas, historically, many of the
concepts underlying hypertext were outlined by Vannevar Bush in 1945, while
the term itself was coined by Nelson in the 1960s, and the latter's only
half-mocking view is that even hypertext researchers are now working on
conceptual problems that were essentially solved twenty years ago. But as
Nelson put it succinctly in his only formal contribution to the conference
- a hilarious and thought-provoking after-dinner speech - we were all,
including even Bill (Great-Satan or Road-Ahead) Gates, 'blind-sided by the
Web.' He'd rather thought that _he_, Ted Nelson, would be taking over the
world, sending forth his cohorts from the heart of Xanadu....

Nonetheless, it is fact that the hypertext community has developed working
systems and concepts to go with them which would allow us far richer, more
varied and extensible models of the new information culture than those
which are provided by today's Web technologies. Taking just one example, 3W
links are uncomplex, unidirectional, unintelligent and unmanaged
(unmanageable?), while the links of many true hypertext systems - mostly
locked away in computer labs or tied to barely accessible 'platforms' - are
richly structured, communicative, open and extensible. They offer a great
deal to future content-providers but seem only just beginning to be able to
supply. Meanwhile, most of the bells and whistles on the 'cooler' pages of
the Web are cosmetic rather than subtantive add-ons to its largely passive,
if immense and tangled, structures. Today's Web interaction is invariably,
perhaps inevitably 'kludgey' and sometimes it is positively 'foobar'.

=2E..

=2E.. But the fascinating prospect, as Smith pointed out, is a Web turned
inside out, where the open programming environments which are currently
tacked onto operating systems, servers and browsers enact a quiet
revolution, such that today's relatively simple Web protocols (http) end up
_inside_ richer, more articulate, hypermedia architectures, while the users
remain unperturbed by a paradigm shift that is all but invisible.

Nelson, the inventor of hypertext _per se_, is a self-confessed
'generalist'. His background was in 'science fiction, movie-making, theatre
and writing.' He expected to go into media but found that he 'couldn't
leave the rich... combative abstractions of academia behind.' Perhaps, once
more, it is the tenor of his influence which underpins a strand of serious
literary and artistic engagement with both 'Hypertext Rhetoric,' and with
the ever-increasing practice of literary hypertext, which now extends from
scholarly, pedagogic web-building, through hypertext fiction (close on
becoming an established, if problematic, genre), to hyper- and cybertextual
poetics. As this is the area of my own particular concern, I hope readers
will forgive me if I pay it an attention which is disproportionate to its
overall place in the conference.

Two papers in this strand of 'hypertext rhetorics' were accepted into the
main conference program. In addition there was a panel, moderated by Marc
Bernstein (who couldn't attend the conference due to illness) and including
myself, on 'The Future of Authorship'. In the first of the papers, David
Kolb, 'author' of _Socrates in the Labyrinth: Hypertext, Argument,
Philosophy_ (Eastgate, 1994) explored some of the yet unrealized potential
of scholarly hypertext, arguing the need for a 'self-represented
complexity' far beyond the capabilities of current systems, not for its own
sake, but because, he suggested, we require such structures in order to
transfer and extend complex, often traditional forms of argument (such as
are found in philosophy) into the hypertextual Web-centred docuverse. Loss
Peque=F1o Glazier, webmaster of the the most important resource for poetics
on the internet, the Electronic Poetry Center based at the Unversity of
Buffalo (http://writing.upenn.edu/epc), gave a paper which structured
links, historical and theoretical, between the poetics of a tradition of
innovative writing and the specific poetics and rhetorics which are
emerging from hypertextual practice. Essential feedback loops were put in
place and many questions raised. The Future of Authorship panel included
three representatives of the wide-ranging hypertext community in France -
Marc Nanard, working on hypermedia design and providing an excellent
overview of the issues, Michel Crampes, developing software agents for
generative hypermedia and interactive editing, and Jean Pierre Balpe, a
poet and editor working on generative fiction, who missed the panel itself
but made the conference later - and one researcher from the MIT media labs
- Kevin Brooks, working on the automatic generation of filmed story
telling. On the same panel, I spoke of writing as programming, where the
process of writing itself (which may include the readers' interactions) may
be seen as a 'prior writing,' as inscription prior to performance (in
codexspace or cyberspace or anyspace). An emergent theme of the panel was
the convergence of 'engineered and creative authorship,' further
complicating and problematizing that rightly troubled term with an
uncertain and highly programmed future.

The literary strand of the conference had an addendum in London, where Jim
Rosenberg, Loss Glazier and Chris Funkhouser read and performed their
(cyber)poetic work at one of the regular London venues for innovative
poetics. A number of figures from the hypertext community attended
alongside the more usual hard-bitten poetics audience. Glazier's reading
was lo-tech but laced with the language poetry of Unix, 'grep'ing across
tribal, national and disciplinary dialects to 'chmod' files of poems for
our use. Funkhouser, a musician, writer and editor in many media including
the 'new,' was a living 'open system,' a neo-Beat mourning Ginsberg's
passing, chanting and reciting words from the MOO space to extend his own
poetry. Rosenberg is an essential cross-over figure who gave a much cited
paper (by a wide range of even the most technology-orientated researchers)
at the previous Hypertext conference. In London, as a PowerBook was passed
from lap to lap in order to demonstrate, hands-on, the interactive
structures which he composes and from which he read, the audience was
treated to the audio channel of his word clusters, simultaneities and
underlying diagrams of syntax. It was a brief and small-scale but important
meeting of convergent galaxies - of hypertext researchers and a few of the
pioneering practioners of emergent literary forms.

Earlier that day, the conference had been closed by the keynote address of
Cathy Marshall, who also attended the reading in London. With a brief to
'look forward,' Marshall eschewed the temptations of a visionary
perspective in order to review and analyse current and anticipated
research, but also, through an extended 'defensive driving' metaphor (the
Smith System) to set out five practices for 'safer hypertext.' Her talk was
a model of complex and illuminating interaction with the specific inputs
and outputs of the community of researcher/practioners who are actively
reading her texts. In fact the spin she put on her chosen metaphor was not
overly concerned with 'safety' as a function of defensiveness or restraint.
Rather, she suggested a heightened awareness and openness to whatever is
'out there' and whatever is out _here_ in the 'wet world' which may emerge
when you 1) steer high, 2) keep your eyes moving, 3) get the big picture,
4) leave yourself an 'out' and 5) make sure the other drivers see you. If
the hypertext community takes her advice, not only will there be an
implosive revolution within the Web, but poets and philosphers will be
welcomed on the way.

in fact, one cute moment at the Poetry & public sphere conference was when
the roundtable moderator introduced first charlie altieri, and then mick
taussig, the latter as the author of "mimesis and altieri."
speaking of the conference, i was in 7th poetry and cult stud heaven.  it
started w/ me and cary nelson, introduced by the gracious and beautiful
harriet davidson.  i talked about some articles in the nyt that offered
possibilities (all limited) for poetry & pubsphere, then sounded a yay for
populist poetry and cultural studies, which i defined according to renato
rosaldo's brief definition in the new book _Mass Culture and Everyday Life_
(ed. peter gibian, routledge).  Cary talked abt the spanish civil war and
poetry about it.  then a roundtable where amiri baraka got into a rousing
argument with miguel algarin about political poetry of the 60 vs that of
the 90s. baraka was right.  i read some previously unpublished bob kaufman
poems, keith roach talked abtout the nuyo poets cafe, reg e gaines talked
about getting turned on to poetry and social change by an etherdge knight
poem, and sonia sanchez talked about her memories being politically
involved.  then dinner.  i had some pals, ed cohen, ira livingston, elaine
chang, amitava kumar, and julie chang, whom i hung out w/ at dinner.  Then
the fabulous NuYorican poets cafe readers, including Reg E, Algarin, Baraka
(who got a standing ovation), Carl Hancock Rux (new to me, wowee, what a
presence!), Tracie Morris (diplomat of the poetry world and high priestess
of African American sound poetry), Aileen Reyes, keith roach.  man o man,
it was energizing, smart, emotionally stirring, and aesthetic as heck!!

okay, i've done the first day. someone else take over.

capitalism bait and switch:  Rain Taxi is free if you find a stack of it
in a store (I hope... I walked away with one ulp!) .. but costs money if
you have to write to them for it. So may I recommend that you stop by
Posman's, hear our listhost read from the Commutative Function of the

So much for posting before 9:30 ...

Mark P. asks the significance of the tagline on my email signature file
(e.g. below).

Mostly "the Caucus Conversation" as present here signifies that my business
signature file is appended to my posts to the list -- I can't figure out
how to have different signatures on messages to different destinations;
that I would even *have to* figure this out indicates the issue of
impoverished identity on computers and networks.

Screen Porch is my workplace, and Caucus is our first product. Caucus is a
software program that runs on Web servers -- "community-building" software,
or groupware, or conferencing. Multiple polysyllabic words to describe the
tool mean that there's poor vocabulary for get-together, work-together
contexts on computers and networks (more impoverished identity).

A typical application for Caucus would be the Poetics list -- it's used for
lots of stuff like that.

About sixty organizations worldwide -- universities, big companies and
government agencies, communities like Echo in NY, non-profits, etc. -- use
Caucus at present counting. Mark, (or anyone else) if you're interested in
knowing more, go to the URL in my signature, follow the "Conferences" link,
and register in the Caucus site at screenporch.com.

The Sun, certainly the most influential
tabloid in the uk since Thatcher came
to power (remember her extraordinary
utterance 'deep in the surface of things')
and responsible for such classics as
'GOTCHA!' when the Belgrano was sunk
during the shame of the Falklands fracas,
ended out the 1992 election campaign
with an election day cover that showed
someone wheeling their luggage through
the departure lounge at Heathrow (of
course my memory might be inflated here)
a bubble image of Neil Kinnock (Labour's leader
of the day) and the banner headline
'Will the last person to leave Britain please
turn out the lights'.

Later that night Kinnock, in tears, on the
steps at Walworth Road (Labours Central
Office) announced that Britain Deserves Better.

It is that phrase that the Blair (rabbit)
campaign has turned on.

Today, The Sun features the smiling
face of Tony (Phoneme) Blair and has the top
of his head being blessed (or annointed or knighted)
by the pointing finger (shades of 'Your Country
Needs You' from WW1 propaganda) and starry hand
from the advertising of the National Lottery.
The banner reads (nat lot slogan 'It Could Be You)
'It Must Be You'  -  then runs on to conflate the
copy beautifully:

'TODAY you have the unique opportunity to join
the greatest jackpot syndicate ever.
The guaranteed prize is a share in our
country's future, a brighter tomorrow.

But this is no gamble. It costs you nothing.
Everyone's a winner. . .'

all offers of employment beyond these islands
will be welcome.

Well, I was there (I was the man, I enjoyed, I was there) at the Rutgers
conference.  It was awesome and monumental.  Trying to summarize it
seems right now a daunting task--I'm still sort of "processing" it (ugh!).
Sorry to delurk just to say this, but, if I have any time this weekend--
a big _if_--I'll try to do some sort of summary for this group.  For
me, anyway, it was an emotionally intense, elating, and draining experience,
with a lot of magnificent poetry, spellbinding performances, provocative
papers, energetic discussions, delightful conversations, and large
roomfuls of people who are _very seriously interested in poetry_!

I should say, as part of this message of deferral, that I found
Charles Bernstein's talk/reading delightfully, brilliantly witty,
and Rachel Blau du Plessis, in two short readings I heard, to be
quite poignant and utterly captivating.

Well, more soon, I hope.

Gwyn McVay asked whether the Tuvan singer in Dragon Bond Rite is the same
one who's in Huun-Huur-Tu. Yes. He is also the man who made a recording
with San Fran bluesman David Pena and taught him to sing khomei. In
response to David Israel's query about Margi Madhu; Madhu is probably one
of the two greatest living practitioners of kudiyattam, which is not a form
from Orissa, a north Indian state; Madhu lives and practices kudiyattam in
its essential site, southern India (Kerala.)

Composer and instrumentalist Jin-Hi Kim, who conceived DBR, plays a
6-string fretted zither, the komungo, which has an ancestry going back
about 1,400 years in Korea. Ms. Kim has been trained in traditional Korean
musical practice, having earned a degree in Korean traditional music at
Seoul National University before coming to the US; she received an MFA in
electronic music/composition at Mills College.Her work LINKING, written for
the Kronos Quartet, was performed at the Darmstadt Festival, BAM Next Wave
Festival, Institute for Contemporary Art in London and the Asian Pacific
Festival in New Zealand. Other works have been presented at Merkin Concert
Hall in NYC, the Juillard School's Focus Festival '96, Alice Tully Hall at
Lincoln Center in NYC and other venues. She has developed the world's only
electric komungo.

David Israel asks for some words about what I've written for this new
music/theater work, whether the piece has "any spoken words, or what?"
Briefly, I've drawn material from my Tablets as well as from other sources,
including Virgil. The Tablets is often a kind of entropic narrative whose
form may encourage semi-aleatoric borrowings.  We have produced
approximately 40 slides. Some slides feature graphics derived from Sumerian
pictographs; I have made these with font-generating software on the Mac,
and have used a number of them in the later Tablets, XXVI and XXVII. The
forthcoming issue of Boxkite, (its initial issue,) from New South Wales,
edited by James Taylor, will contain my essay GLOSSES which discusses some
of these matters.

Some of the words and phrases are spoken, sometimes in English, sometimes
in Korean, Japanese, Tuvan, Sanskrit and/or Indonesian. Other sequences are
printed on slides, made by using Microsoft PowerPoint. There are other
permutations. All the language sequences on the slides are in English.

Jin-Hi Kim and I, along with Rick Emmert--who teaches Noh in Tokyo, and has
a crucial role in the work--have been working for three years to arrive at
a theater piece which presents the work of great traditional artists in
delicate relationship with the contextual urgings of post-modernity, a word
I'm not crazy about; this is a description whose simplicism frustrates me
but I'll use this language as a shortcut for this brief response. In DBR,
we try assiduously to respect the integrity of the traditionalist forms and
practices all the while we are attempting to create a working
consanguinity; for most of the artists this is the first time they will
have worked closely with members of other Asian traditions; there are
occasional language problems, but on the whole we manage extremely well,
the performers show great enthusiasm and are eager to learn from each
other. We're in the final activity of preparation before the last week of
rehearsal at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis the last week of May. I
very much appreciate the interest in DBR.

"No North American or European poet of this century has created a body of
work that reflects more deeply on the inherent conflicts between truth
telling and the inevitable artifice of poetry than Laura (Riding)
Jackson."
      --Charles Bernstein, from the introduction

Granted, Charles, and a belated congratulations for posting the existence
of this work to the list and for your part in it. I was once heavily
preoccupied with Riding (Jackson), both her poems and the only prose
document I'd been aware of, _The Telling_, both of which I recommend.
They're not exactly light bedtime reading, though!

Quite a statement! I was interested in her exemplary renunciation of
poetry, taking it as a challenge and implicit criticism of my own work
and everyone else's, and wondered if it could be compared to others'
rejections -- specifically, Rimbaud's. I concluded that it couldn't!
Following the logic of some of her sentences made me dizzy, however.

Are you, or are others, aware of any biography of her? Her early years,
when she was supposedly the model for Graves' _White Goddess_ and the
author of many critical essays skewering the models of the time
(William Empson? Stephen Spender?) would make for good reading, I'd think.

Found this re: mayday UK elections, a Thatcher quote:

     ''There is no such thing as society; there are individual men and
women and there are families.'' Thatcher, October 1987.

This would put Mark's comment (an echo of a Silliman line) in the context
of a right wing rugged-individualism that wants to dismantle any kind of
social program. To be less polemical about it, I'd modify Mark's statement
to read .. "You might think you're an individual, but to the entities
considered persons by the law who are deciding what you're worth, you're
far less than three-fifths..."

Religious people offended by the religious right are not going to give up
using various versions of the word "God" for that reason.  Nor will people
who think they might be individuals surrender the meaning of the word
because Thatcherism & Reaganism manipulated it.  But there sure are further
complexities roun' here & I wonder if the Rutgers conference got into them.

I wonder if someone could make a valid argument that one of the reasons
poetry lacks attention & status (until recently) is because in the long
development of "literature" the activity of lyric SELF-expression has
broken the borders of the lyric poem & infused all genres.  That the
normative expectation now of a novelist or playwright or etc. is a
lifelong devotion to a private, personal, individual mode of expressing
personal experience. That this is the crux of the "quest" of the artist -
to integrate & interiorize everything.  & in the process poetry just
got absorbed - it's all poetry.  Even language poetry or public performance
art is a supremely individual rendering of impersonal language or group
history.  Easy to scoff at this in an ideological approach, but for the
maker whose words are manna & life itself - life is sometimes on the line.

Reagan used the same lever to dismantle decent government.  And we are
all put off by the ego of the artist.  Reagan & his era could be looked
at in the lens of Aristotle, maybe.  There's the Actor masquerading as
a Man of Action (opposite of Hamlet, who in order to act had to become
an actor).  There's the res publica becoming an artifice of rhetoric,
a disneyland phantasm.

Good ol Mandelstam has a wonderful poem about Crete, last stanza something
like:

This was, turned blue, and was sung
long before Odysseus,
long before food and drink
were called "mine."

"Classicism is revolution."

addendum to previous post: what is that gist or spark that transcends
all analyses of self-expression, etc?  Is it the secret of writing/
reading itself?  the oscillation between je and autre?  2 poets
who broke through the modernist revolution & postmodernist devolution
& (re)created the forms of civic poetry: Auden, Brodsky (more for the
Russians than Americans).  Probably not much read on zis list (a big
assumption).  But I heard some Auden in J. Moxley's recent book
(then I'm often hearing things in the dark...).  A dry-eyed almost
scientific approach to poetry, sceptical, rhetorical in a political
sense (I'm talking about Auden here).  18th century.

wasn't that your parody of the Providence School?  I appreciated your
manipulation of scoff-rhyme but it cut rather close.  I sent it to the
Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies - there's a prof. there who
thinks it might reflect a realistic elevator-shoe-device to help hold up
the Fermat Conundrum. You'll probabilitally be hearing from them any light-day

ARROWHEAD (IN THE SHAPE OF A STATE)

    A
maze of lakes in northern Minnesota,
crisp air adrift on owl's wings
between the wide gray skies
and a long swath of muted pines,
waves lapping, lapping
against the riding prow
of the motorboat, my father
at the tiller, smiling, looking
out toward the shore, quiet,
his beard growing rough now
after a day or two in the woods--

I'm afraid of diving too deep
back into the skin of the past,
my callow bones, the large
boy head full of springing
phantasms, upstart to replace
a sense of imperfection
with voracious all-devouring
enveloping thought--fishline,
this daily bread of blind birdsong.
Before you, Iron Range long gone, I
will always be that unbound, reedy son.

Thu, 1 May, from Joe Safdie:

<< I was interested in [Laura Riding Jackson's] exemplary renunciation of
poetry, taking it as a challenge and implicit criticism of my own work and
everyone else's, and wondered if it could be compared to others'
rejections -- specifically, Rimbaud's. >>

One thinks, of course (for comparison), of Marcel Duchamps (though he
did tinker out that great late work in secret) --

Interesting that she continued to write in prose while renouncing poetry
-- i.e., seemingly distrusted (?) poetry, but not (in the same way) prose?
(I realize these aren't questions for glib answer -- & no doubt the vol. that
Charles announced addresses some of this . . .)

<< Are you, or are others, aware of any biography of her? Her early
years, when she was supposedly the model for Graves' _White
Goddess_ and the author of many critical essays skewering the models of
the time  (William Empson? Stephen Spender?) would make for good
reading, I'd think. >>

Joe, at first I misread this as "are you aware of my biography of her?" ! --
as well.  Yes, I have (somewhere) a copy of a promising-looking bio
entitled *In Extremis* (but haven't taken time yet to delve into it . . . )

Incidentally, there's a play, *The Beekeeper's Daughter,* based (with
changes of names and with a particular emphasis etc.) on the figures of
Robert Graves & Laura Riding -- written by Karen Malpede (the NYU
theatre professor).  I saw this in Lee Nagrin's Bleeker St. studio a couple
years ago (Nagrin -- an old frirend -- had a role in the piece).  I know
Karen was looking toward developing it further, but don't know present
status of those efforts.

Looking back at Lab Book from UB Poetics (1992), and it's just about
coming into focus. If copies still exist, I endorse heartily the purchase.
Of interest not merely because it contains early (but representative) work
by Juliana Spahr, Mark Wallace, Jena Osman, Lew Daly, Jeff Hansen, Bill
Tuttle, Elizabeth Burns, Elizabeth Willis, Cynthia Kimball and Peter
Gizzi, but also because it provides a record the closest thing to a
POETICS archive for the workshop process short of a documentary film. To
refresh the memory: each workshop participant submitted a poem to the
group to be responded to; the poems and their responses are revealing.
When the book came out, I had no idea what any of these people were
talking about (my bad). Now, the styles are clearer (more work exists,
more reading has transpired, and I'm getting older too...).

That said, thanks, Joseph, for the bibl. ref. for those psalmists -- do
others on the list know of other psalm translators worth looking into?

great stuff! hard to believe 164 different stanzaic and 94 different
metrical patterns in mary's psalms.  i like also that her translations are
based not on a single source-text but an amalgamation of prose psalters in
english, french metrical psalters, a coupla versions of the bible, etc.

just actually found this line in wyatt last night: (psalm 38)

        So ar myn entrayles infect with fervent sore,
        Fedyng the harme that hath my welth oprest,
        That in my fleshe is lefft no helth before.

yikes!  his only use of the word "entrayles" according to the concordance.

Had to step out before Creeley read (early work, I hear) but I caught John
Godfrey and Cecilia Vicuna at the opening reading of the Poetry Project's
30th anniv. party. Godfrey, subdued, was _on_, especially on "For Ice" and
"Day Goo". He opened with two elegies (for Allen Ginsberg and for Jim
Brodey, respectively), followed with what I think he referred to as "the
difficult ones", and sailed on through in his Michael Learned as Celine
manner.

Titles:
        Big Lips
        The James Brother
        Grasp Is Provide
        Ten Times Lighter
        Very Worn Cloth
        For Ice
        Day Goo
        Same Feet
        Evil Tunnels
        The Slightest Foam

and before I knew it they were introducing Cecilia Vicuna, pow, they're
done, no one gets up. Some laughter. No reader, but then a scratching
noise from the front (and the important thing to know is that Ed Friedman
had the room turned around so that people were sitting up on the stage
looking past the podium at the front door which Ed dramatically closed at
the start of the reading) and eventually singing. CV got up and read in a
whisper, then very loud, and startled by the duration she suddenly
realized she was expected to read for, finished with poems from her light
book. Then there was an intermission... In the audience: Anne Waldman,
Bernadette Mayer, Phil Good, Dug Rothschild, Daniel Cane, Bill Luoma, Greg
Masters, Brenda Coultas, Anselm Berrigan, Elinor Nauen, Richard Hell and
like sixty or so others.

The English poet Peter Levi recently did some trans. of Psalms for Penguin,
but I've not looked at them closely and don't know if they merit further
attention. Also, (I think) the seemingly ubiquitous Stephen Mitchell?
Sidney's stuff with his sis the Countess of Pembroke is great to read
alongside the KJV.

Yes,  out here in Albuquerque the University of New Mexico Bookstore
expanded and moved across the street (Central) from The Living Batch
Bookstore, and so The Living Batch died a pathetic death--along with The
Salt of the Earth Bookstore down the street.  These two independent
bookstores were crushed by the chains and UNM conglomerate, and were the
only real places in Allblueturkey to get poetry, Latin American lit and
books, postmodernism, theory, lit crit, obscure, etc. etc.

Not to mention great readings, expert advise, local news, actual people,
etc.     So, killing of smaller independent bookstores is going on all over.

Paul Auster's obit about covers it.

Cambridge & Boston continue to have an incredible variety of excellent book
stores--mostly used. In fact, I've managed to pick up all my wants in the
past few weeks in the form of review copies--small press poetry, university
presses, the works--brand new and at half price!!

Am I the only reader who finds the explanation for how Kristen Prevallet's
name got dropped from her writing more than a little questionable?  I
mean, I've experienced any number of computer glitches and copy editing
confusion, but given the fact that the attribution should have appeared in
at least three places (on the essay, in the contents, and in the
acknowledgements) this seems a bit of a stretch to me --

yeah, it's too bad that they can't just apologize and promise future
appropriate reference without having to lie. computer glitches indeed.  i'd
like to know if kristen feels that this is an adequate and satisfactory
settlement.  kristen are you out there? any comment?--md

(Patrick Pritchett)


April 15 Tax Day, In the American Tradition of Anguish

Dear Friends:

       After fourteen years and sixty-three issues of Exquisite Corpse, the
editors have decided to kill themselves. The magazine will continue to
appear, of course. After one minute of thinking about this, however, we have
reversed our position, and decided to kill the Corpse instead. After that
minute, however, we realized that a Corpse cannot be killed. Given the
difficulty of this paradox, we have decided that:

       The bi-monthty publication of Exquisite Corpse will be suspended
while the editors prepare a massive anthology culled from our sixty-three
issues, to be published in 1988. After the anthology appears, we will either
reappear in a new format or produce a yearly anthology. Meanwhile, ghost
Corpses will continue to be telepathically issued, available free from the
community of writers we have nurtured. Their collective ectoplasmic
connections will produce many more issues than we could have delivered in
the cumbersome typographic manner.

       It has always been our intention to cease and desist when we got
bored. Until now, neither penury nor overwork, stopped us from our task of
delivering the news, but the time came, finally, when Baudelaire's certitude
that we "know this monster well," sank home with the finality of one
thousand printer's bills, mailing lists, unsolicited offenses, and
institutional rigidity.

       To our contributors we say, "do not hold a wake, unless we can be
there," to our readers we say, "remember us until we return," and to our
subscribers we declare, "subtract what remains of your subscription from the
price of the anthology, which we will send to you postage-free," and to
those who never read us we say, "you are old, your taste is execrable."

     Until we return, remember the good days. We love you.

                   Andrei Codrescu, editor
                   Laura Rosenthal, executrix

Subject:      More Poetry & the Public Sphere Conf Summary (LONG)

Here are a few more comments about the Poetry and the Public
Sphere Conference, which I'm writing even though I really need to
be grading papers.  This is all from memory--I never take notes--so
forgive me for lapses.

First of all, I differ strongly with Maria Damon, whom I unmet--i.e.,
met in passing by way of saying goodbye, and whose opening
statement, alas, I missed, because my flight got in at 4:00.  No,
Amiri Baraka was most certainly _not_ right.  Baraka was and is full
of baloney.  His arguments were just more boring, thoughtless Old
Left rant, as was his "reading," during most of which he _yelled_
into the microphone of an already loud PA system, as if to punish us
"academics" for our "complicity" with The Oppressor Capitalist Pigs,
etc., etc.  All total bullshit.  The debate between him and Miguel
Algarin, a very gentle soul, was about political poetry of the 60s and
90s.  Baraka, of course, was saying that the political poetry of the
60s was better because it was direct, upfront, "truly" political,
spoke to The People, blah blah blah--the stuff that I assume Maria
agrees with and that I find really obnoxious nonthought (sorry,
Maria, I know this is getting off on the wrong foot with you, and I
regret that).  Algarin was saying that the "political" poetry of the
60s is outmoded because it is unsubtle and lacking in the theoretical
sophistication we need in the 90s.  It boiled down to Algarin saying,
"We need _theories_," and Baraka cutting him off and yelling, "No we
don't, we need _action_!"  A nice moment of comic relief was had
when Algarin pointed out, in the midst of Baraka's ranting about
academics and their salaries (oh, yes, we make just _so_ much
money!) that ties them to the Capitalist System--that Baraka himself
was paid $5,000 for his appearance.  Plenty of poets and scholars
there were not paid a cent for being there, AFAIK.  Baraka was shut
up for a second or two as he tried to figure out something clever to
say.  There were a lot of really great readings of poetry throughout
the conference, but Baraka's was not, IMO, one of them.  Same for
Reg E. Gaines and keith roach, so far as I remember.  As for this
Reginald Rux guy, he went on forever with a lot of "political" and
somewhat egocentric blather that I found supremely boring.  By
contrast, I found Tracie Morris really stunning and Aileen Reyes
wonderful.  So I thought the first evening was a thought-provoking
mixed bag.

Now that that's all off my chest, I have to say, of course, that I was
grateful to hear all of these poets, even the ones I didn't like.

Every afternoon, evening, and night, there were great readings
(sometimes embedded within panel discussions) by great poets,
including--going on memory now--Reyes and Morris (mentioned
above), Charles Bernstein, Robert Hass, Meena Alexander, Abena
Busia, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Alica Ostriker, Bob Perelman,
Adrienne Rich, Robin Pastorio-Newman, Cheryl Clarke, Regie
Cabico, Rafael Campo, Andy Clausen, Rachel Hadas, Rebecca
Reynolds, Michael Weaver, Ross Talarico, Eliot Katz, and others.  I
actually didn't like Abena Busia very much, either as poet or in her
talk on the "Locations of Poetry" panel shared with Charles Altieri
and Arnold Rampersad.  (This was generally a dreadful panel--
summary below.)  I also don't quite know why Meena Alexander is
such a big noise--I just didn't find it in the poetry, although she did
give a very compelling statement in the "Poetry, Feminism, and the
Difficult Wor(l)d" panel, that was sort of a poem, or anyway quite
poetic.

More Details:

I've already covered Thursday night as best I can.  I missed most of
the first Concurrent Panels session Friday morning because it
involved getting on a bus from the hotel at 8:15, which I missed :-( .
I just barely made it to the last 3/4 or so of Brian McHale's paper in
the panel on "The Feminist Avant-Garde," on Susan Howe, in which
he showed how some poems of Howe were playing with Spenserian and
Shakespearean phrases that have been known so well over the
centuries that they have become more or less part of the permanent
detritus or soil of English-speaking culture.  Thus they are already
out of context (so to speak), but Howe would then put these phrases
in yet more strained contexts, to defamiliarize them anew, as a kind
of intervention in the economy of poetical discourse.  (Is that about
right, Brian?)  Interesting discussion afterwards in which just about
everybody missed the point that Howe was not Pound and not merely
alluding, but estranging the overfamiliar that has literary origins.

Keynote Panel:  "Cultural Poetics, Cultural Politics," with Meena
Alexander, Charles Bernstein, and Tricia Rose, hosted by Elin
Diamond.  Alexander's talk was more or less (I think) about the
complexities of identity created by postcolonialism and a multicultural
world, and she closed with a poem reflecting upon her self--both
poetic and personal--in the setting of Riverside Park (I guess),
overlooking the Hudson and the Washington Bridge.  The Bridge
would be the operative metaphor here, I think, as well as the river.
Bernstein talked about how poetry works precisely (I think this is
right!) by _undermining_ the apparently simplicity of the social self,
by foregrounding its discursively constructed nature, and he
closed, as I recall, with a brilliant poem.  I was thinking the whole
time about the ways that his talk was addressing some of the issues
in my paper better than my paper did, or whatever.  It questioned
the sincerity of the personal voice in "political" poetry and
suggested that the truly political act of poetry was precisely to
render the personal voice an artifice and an object of play.  His poem
exemplified this, among other things, by containing a long and
delightful catalogue of what kind of poet "he" "is."  The first of
these items was:  "I am a New Formalist poet."  This got a lot of
laughs, but it is also remarkably _true_, insofar as much of what
Bernstein read at the conference _is_ in meter--thus exploding the
rightwing identification of "formalism"--something I wsa trying to do
in my paper as well.  Tricia Rose's paper, on "Poetic Testimony:
Race, Gender, and Popular Poetry," claimed (a) that testimony
doesn't _really_ require that the events told _really_ happened (and
thus that the speaker is still understood to be a poetic artifice), and
(b) that, insofar as there _is_ some connection to reality, testimony
"complements" the playful artifice of poetry, rather than working
against it.  During the audience part, Charles Altieri pointed out
that Tricia Rose's statement (esp the latter part) and Charles
Bernstein's were actually quite at odds with each other, but that
they were (I think Rose was) attempting to smooth over the
difference.  Both of them gave, I thought, an inadequate reply to
what I thought to be a correct statement on Altieri's part.  Indeed,
throughout the conference, one of the running threads turned out to
be the question of the relation between "testimony" and "poetic
artifice," and, with that, the oral vs. the written, populism vs. some
other concept of democracy, representation vs. the aesthetic, the
personal vs. the impersonal ...  And it seems to me that none of
these questions was resolved, which is probably o.k.

I went next to the "Feminist Collectives/Identities" panel, but caught
only a little--the whole of Linda A. Kinnahan's fine paper on
"_HOW/ever_, Then and Now," and a little of Jen Benka's and
Jennifer Geigel's joint presentation, which I left after a while
because it involved a slide show that was set up so that nobody who
came in late could see it.

The next session included my own panel, on "Form and Contemporary
Publics," with Nick Yasinski and Jonathan Monroe.  I enjoyed
meeting both of them, finding Nick a particularly delightful and
endearlingly modest personality.  Nick presented a superb close
reading of an "oral" poem by Regie Cabico included in Miguel
Algarin's anthology of Nuyorican poets, thus demonstrating that the
apparent "identity" in "identity politics" can indeed be complex,
playful, and poetic.  (I agree--but I also think that some poets
manage this better than others.)  Jonathan Monroe's talk centered on
READ, an educational program that did not include poetry, and how
another program that did could easily be integrated into READ's
goals.  My own paper urged a distinction between populism and
democracy (see above), and also the importance of the connection
between poetry and literacy (and thus democracy) and therefore the
_re_readability of poems.  This gave way to an interesting
discussion, especially involving my paper and Nick's.  I am still
unsure how work like that of Tracie Morris fits into what I was
saying, because it really is (IMO) superb poetry, but it doesn't seem
entirely _literate_--i.e., involving reading and rereading, becoming
spatialized int the mind, repeatable.  Then again, maybe it _is_.  In
some ways, Tracie Morris's musical "sound poems" are enactments of
the closest kind of close reading--the repetition of words until they
become mere sounds in music.  Well, obviously, I'm still thinking
about all of this.  I think people were disturbed by my distinction
between populism and democracy, especially WRT the Nuyorican
poets, and I'm quite unsure about that relation myself, although I
_am_ reasonably sure, otherwise, of the distinction.  I was flattered
that Charles Altieri came to the panel (at least I _think_ that was
he!) and seemed to agree with me, at least a little.  Harriet Davidson
was there, too, who did not quite agree with me, but who is so totally
_agreeable_ a person that it's hard to _disagree_ with her about
anything ever.

Next came a plenary panel on "The Difference that Poetry Makes."
The ever cute (sorry, don't mean to embarrass him!) Nick Yasinski
took on the difficult task of presiding over this group of learned
people, some of whom were rather longwinded--interestingly, all of
them men--the women managed to be quite concise.  All of the
speakers were asked to answer the question, "What difference does
poetry make?" and to respond to two quotations:  one, Auden's
"Poetry makes nothing happen," and the other, Adorno saying that
"Poetry is impossible after the holocaust."  Altieri started off with
the usual shapeless fuzz, and, as opposed to another talk he gave
later, in this case, I honestly couldn't quite follow his point.  Sorry!
I do seem to remember, however, that this was the talk where he
pointed out that young people today are in an awkward position in
relation to literacy and literature.  Whereas earlier generations could
rebel against their parents by _reading_ and getting educated, this
is no longer the case, since the parents are usually educated and
literate.  (This may have come up in another talk.)  Robert Hass
gave a _very_ long talk, but I confess that I found it utterly
fascinating.  It had two parts.  First, he conducted the thought
experiment of what difference poetry makes by imagining a world
without poetry to see whether it would be any different from our
world.  What he found--in a way almost echoing Roman Jakobson--is
that poetry is so totally embedded in language in general that it's
simply unimaginable to have a "world" in a normal sense that would
be totally without poetry.  "So," he concluded nonchalantly, "that
was a _cul-de-sac_."  He then talked about the difference poetry
_has_ made, as a kind of benefit of literacy, intimately tied to the
history of literacy in modern times, as a distinctively _American_
phenomenon--the growth of literacy being directly tied to certain
ideological developments first in the United States and only later in
other "developed" countries.  Literacy in the US started with the
importance the Purtitans laid upon the ability to read the Bible to
save one's soul, and literacy in New England throughout early
American history was very high--over 90% (I think), while it was
rather low elsewhere.  In the early 19th century, still, only a
minority of American adults could produce a signature (his index for
literacy in the most basic sense).  (A fortiori, it was always only a
small minority throughout Europe.)  In the same period--really
starting in the late 18th century (Federalist period)--the ideology
linking reading to salvation was secularized into one that linked
reading to citizenship.  During the slavery era, reading also was
obviously linked to freedom and political self-determination.  By the
time shortly before the Civil War, already, a significantly higher
proportion of adult nonenslaved men could produce a signature,
relative to the proportion of the same in Europe.  After the Civil
War, public schools were established for all citizens, and literacy
rates continued to rise steadily.  Literacy was connected with
upward mobility.  There was also a series of three different
ideological rationales for the importance of literacy throughout the
19th century, after its secularization.  First, literacy was viewed as
a chance at access to the great wonders and beauties (i.e., poetry)
hitherto only available to the aristocracy--it was the democratization
of verbal wealth.  This concept went ahead until around the turn of
the century, when the lettered elite was no longer a significant social
force, and when poetry was already heavily associated with the
middle class rather than the European aristocracy--as typified by
Walt Whitman and his imitators.  Poetry had been re-formed, in a
sense, to become less aristocratic--as the lower classes entered
literacy, they transformed it.  The next ideology, picking up in the
late 19th century, was the association of the reading of poetry and
cultivation of beauty with the ennobling of the soul; people who could
read and appreciate poetry would be more moral.  This idea came to a
catastrophic end with the holocaust of WWII, when everyone saw that
it was possible to be a great aesthete and lover of poetry and still put
millions of people to death.  Finally, emerging in the early 20th
century was the association of literacy and the reading of poetry with
the refinement of cognitive skills, an association still alive today and
motivating education to some extent.  Literacy in the US crested at
around 90% in the year 1960, and has been dropping steadily since
then--not only in numbers but in quality:  the average 8th grader in
Texas reads at only a 4th-grade level.  So, poetry makes a
difference by contributing to literacy, and what we need is more of
both.  Tracie Morris took much less time to say something about
equally fascinating.  She introduced it more personally as the
difference that poetry has made _for her_, and therefore presented
it as autobiography, but of course it turned out to be a parable.  She
had wondered as a child whether she was crazy, because she liked
talking to herself.  "Don't worry," she was told, "You're not crazy if
you talk to yourself, so long as you don't _answer_ yourself."
Later, in school, reading Poe's "The Raven," she was struck by how
crazy the speaker is--he not only talks to himself but also answers
himself.  Why, if he knows the bird can only say one word, would he
be crazy enough to ask it, "Will I ever see my beloved again"?  Why
not ask, "Will I ever get sick"!  As an adult, she went to several
different community poetry projects, including, eventually, the
Nuyorican Poets' Cafe.  She learned about "sound poetry," and
tends to use this technique especially to address matters, such as
the Middle Passage, that she regards as unspeakable.  Thus poetry
is a way of dealing sanely with a crazy situation, and a way of being
both sane and crazy simultaneously, letting her talk to herself and
answer herself without being considered crazy.  (I hope I got the
drift of that right.)  Michael Taussig, next, gave by far the longest
talk--endless and shapeless and utterly without a thesis.  It wound
up moving towards a reference to _The Nervous System_.  Charles
Bernstein went next, and spoke while a slide behind him projected an
image by a French artist:  a road sign in a lozenge shape, divided by
a horizontal bar into two triangles.  In the top one were the words,
_DU CALME_ ("Relax!"); in the bottom, "Poetry makes nothing
happen."  Bernstein, I think, both argued and _showed_ (in prose
and verse) how the "nothing" that poetry makes happen is, itself,
something important in the political sphere (see above).  Lynn Keller
came last, with very little time left.  She pointed out, first, that the
two quotations are out of context, and that both writers thought
differently of poetry at other times.  Secondly, she focused on the
difference that poetry has made, in the (later) 20th century, for
_women_, because, before then, women had not been able to publish
their poetry before.  The possibility for women readers to read
poetry by women poets, representing women together or alone and
not at objects of male fantasy, has made an immense difference for
women.

I've run out of time, so I'll have to summarize the rest of the
conference in a Part II, to come shortly.

don't worry amitai you didn't get off on the wrong foot w/ me for
disagreeing abt baraka.  but i do disagree. what i heard was simply
different from what you heard.  what i heard was algarin saying glibly: 60s
poetry was all rhetoric and theory, today its about feelings, not theory.
to which baraka rightly pointed out that 1) to claim to have no theory is a
theory and 2) political poetry of the 90s owes a lot to political poetry
and poets of the 60s.  it is miguel who was anti-theoretical.  i'm glad
we're talking about tracie morris; about a year ago i asked why there was
no discussion of her on the list and now there is.  i hope it's not just
bcause she mentioned kurt schwitters.  she's unbelievable, and quite the
poetry diplomat as well. i found hass boring, suspect him of
underestimating the educational level of his audience.  i found reg e
gaines terrific on the roundtable, pretty good at his reading, tho i'd
heard most of the material before.  i'm a big baraka fan, so there you have
it.  i found algarin's reading less compelling than i have in the past.
bernstein and morris were big favorites of mine and that seemed a crowd
consensus.  i love mick taussig tho i seem to be in a minority on that
score; everythng he sez is fascinating to me.  i wa with folks who watned
to leave after bernstein so didn't get to hear lynn k, sorry lynn.  i too
had trouble following charlie ulterior's talk.  ditto both exposures to
meena alexander.  adrienne rich was impressive.  now i'm skipping all over
the place. i was very pleased to hear steven caton, who told a tale of the
role poetry played in a very tense political negotiation between two
factions of a yemeni tribe who ended up going to war over an abduction of 2
young women; and walter kalaidjian on trauma theory and poetry, focussng on
th armenian genocide.  i was sorry to miss mdavidson's talk, but went to a
wonderful demonstration of poets in the schools state of the art with craig
czury, tobey kaplan and someone else i missed cuz i was having coffee w/
andy clausen, an old friend i hadn't seen in almost 20 yrs, who gave a
rousing 7-minute beat style reading...also took in tracie morris's panel on
sound poetry in the africn amercan tradition, which featured beans, a very
exciting dj/mc/rapper who's gotten into poetry in a more purposive way, and
cheryl boyce taylor, a member of the performance group cayenne.  another
good panel was lynn keller on alice fulton, michael eldridge on linton
kwesi johnson and the construction of "black britain," and a third speaker
i missed.  eliot katz's reading was quite charming, and ed roberson's was
haunting.  i was exhausted and had seen sonia sanchez a month or so earlier
so skipped out on her and the poet laureate, and the wild locals reading
that followed.  the final roundtable, with walter k, bob holman and others
was also exciting to me.  there, maybe you'all can piece together some
general idea of the proceedings from all these conflicting reports.

Dear Poet Folk:

I'm in the process of revising an essay and need a citation from
Brathwaite's History of the Voice.  It's out of print and the one copy in
the U of Iowa Library is checked out.  I am looking for a short passage
(about 4 or 5 lines)  on p. 13 where EKB discusses the difference between
a dialect and a nation language.  (I had notes on this section of the book
that I can't seem to find.)  Could someone be a peach and either post it
or backchannel me?

Thanks a bundle!

Julie:

"History of the Voice" has been reprinted in _Roots_ (U. of Michigan,
1993), which is where this appears on page 266:

    I think, however, that language does really have a role to play here,
  certainly in the Caribbean. But it is an Enlgish that is not the standard,
  imported, educated English, but that of the submerged, surrealist experience
  and sensibility, which has always been there and which is now increasingly
  coming to the surface and influencing the perception of contemporary
  Caribbean people. It is what I call, as I say, _nation language_. I use the
  term in contrast to _dialect_. The word dialect has been bandied about
  for a long time, and it carries very pejorative overtones. Dialect is
  thought of as "bad" English. Dialect is "inferior" English. Dialect is
  the language when you want to make fun of someone. Caricature speaks in
  dialect. Dialect has a long history coming from the plantation where
  people's dignity was distorted through their languages and the descriptions
  that the dialect gave to them. Nation language, on the other hand, is the
  submerged area of that dialect that is much more closely allied to the
  African aspect of experience in the Caribbean. It may be in English, but
  often it is in an English which is like a howl, or a shout, or a machine-gun,
  or the wind, or a wave. It is also like the blues. And sometimes it is
  English and African at the same time.


Hope the lines you're looking for are here somewhere...


Best,
Stephen Cope

Thanks, Amittai, for your "long" but informative post.  I feel like
digressing from the issue of the conference itself to pursue something you
said: "the ideology
linking reading to salvation was secularized into one that linked
reading to citizenship.  During the slavery era, reading also was
obviously linked to freedom and political self-determination." (Hass?)

The Puritan/Slave connection is not, to my mind, simply coincident.  Some
crucial writers (crucial to me anyway) significantly receive both - the
one who comes most to mind is W.E.B. Du Bois who, taught by William James
at Harvard, credits James with providing him with the philosophic tools it
took to produce *The Souls of Black Folk* - through James, Du Bois got
basically the whole history of Puritan thought as regards reading - on its
far end I'd say its embodied by Emerson's statement that grammar is
"organization tyrannizing over character" something that James himself
spells out more systematically in the *Psychology* by deemphacizing
grammatical "substantives" (nouns, etc) and emphacizing instead words like
"if" "and" "to" "but" (no coincidence either that G. Stein was also his
student).  So Du Bois gets a serious education in Puritan-style
poststructuralism.

At the same time he has (or discovers) the history of the relationship
between slavery/post-slavery and reading/literacy.  Frederick Douglas
takes the words of his "master," "if you teach that nigger how to read
there would be no keeping him" and simply reverses its intended value -
"what he most dreaded that I most desired" - saying "From that moment, I
understood the pathway from slavery."  At the same time, however, he has
an incredible awareness of the materiality of writing, its implication in
the history of slavery and as such the scarred nature of the word,
captured stunningly in that metaphor I can never get out of my head: "My
feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am
writing might be laid in the gashes."  Here the Puritan suspicion that
words are - for the human being - scarred and cracked (that they don't
signify as intended, that they can't be read "accurately") meets an
unintended double that wouldn't have been lost on Du Bois.  Freedom, then,
or democracy, concepts which get so much play in latter-day fromulations
of Puritan antimonianism, always involves a scar.  Du Bois's long
flirtation with and ultimate acceptance of CPUSA seems to me to have come
out of his frustration that these scars continued to be inflicted
willfully (his communism - at least on the philosophic level - remained
uneasy, still quoting Emerson on democracy as late as '61).

Anyway, thanks again for the post, it got me thinkin'.  Baraka too, seems
interesting in this context - as late as *Blues People* ('63) he's
celecrating the tradition of "Western Non-Conformity" - a tradtion which
of course prominently includes Puritan antinomians from Ann Hutchinson to
Emerson ("Whoso would be a man must be a non-conformist") though his
mid-sixties break with Greenwich Village culture would have included that
tradition ("the Party of Insane Hope" as he would later call it).  Ok,
I'll shut up now.

-Mike.

Kasparov Beats IBM in Game One of Chess Match

NEW YORK (Reuter) - World chess champion Garry Kasparov slowly
squeezed the best chess-playing supercomputer into submission Saturday
to win the first game of their $1.1 million re-match in New York.

The game began with a quiet, closed opening more suited to the
34-year-old Russian grandmaster's ability to form long-term judgement
about his game plan, then exploded in the middlegame with a sacrifice
by Kasparov and ended with the champion forcing home a positional
advantage.

"Kasparov won this game with such finesse," said International Master
Maurice Ashley of the United States, who was one of the official
commentators. "His understanding of the computer's weaknesses was
pushed to a higher level today."

"It was very complicated and tense," Kasparov said. "I couldn't
calculate the position but I felt with these two pawns it would be
enough in the endgame."

Kasparov frequently says that the machine's huge calculating powers
are no match for his vast experience and intuition about chess. The
Russian, world champion since 1985, is considered by most experts to
be the best ever player of the ancient game.

well, not too much, except that let's see, i hate to do the paper injustice
thru inaccurate paraphrase: it documented the establishment of black
britain as primarily caribbean (much as gates's article in the new yorker
does) but then goes on to talk about the alliances that were made w/ other
ethnic immigrants of color most notably south asians who were subsumed
under the label "black," but never got as much airplay until, or even
after, l'affaire rushdie.  talked about "black britain" as a trendy import
to the u.s. complete w/ theorists such as gilroy, mercer and hall...
parallel to lkj's rise as first a poet then public dub poet now mostly
journalist who has become disillusioned w/ attempt to do political,
cross-ethnic alliance cultural work...

Amittai F Avriam, thank you very much for your comments on the =
conference.  Do you think that it would be possible to somehow get a =
copy of  Brian McHale's paper in the panel on "The Feminist =
Avant-Garde," on Susan Howe, or perhaps some of the other papers?  will =
something be published? Let me know if you get a chance, and thanks =
again. dan

Thursday night at New College, Ron Johnson gave a criminally underattended
reading from the now-complete, probably last modernist poetry epic of the
20th century, _ARK_.  Prefacing by saying he "wanted NOT to include
history" in his epic as Zukofsky, Olson and Pound had in theirs, and that
he was influenced by the architecture of famous buildings such as Watts
Towers, he proceeded to read variously from the Foundations, Spires, Arches
that comprise the work.  Some of the lines I brought away with me were:

the eye may be said to be sun in another form
all men are lidless visionaries through the night
the lord is a delicate hammerer
a vaulting of arteries beating against the dark.  This is the body of light
primrose abysm
at the back of it all, ardor and fire
riddle iota sublime
where heat sweats wheat for purple mountain majesties

Ron also read from a work of 67 short, dark quatrains about death and
resurrection that was made into a poster with the poems arranged in the
shape of a pyramid.  These poems packed quite a punch, too.

Others in the spellbound audience included MC Adam Cornford, Andrew Joron,
Charles Smith, Kevin Killian, Cliff Gassoway, and Kush.  Some 6 of us
retired to Picaro afterwards and chatted over tapas.  Ron said it took him
20 years to write ARK, but wouldn't tell me how old he was when he started.

Friday night (also at New College but this time via Small Press Traffic)
Dale Smith returned from Austin to read with Joanne Kyger.  Dale read newer
work including stuff influenced by his reading _Anna Karenina_.  The list
of lines includes:

love's embarrassing lack of eros
there is no fair way to love death
the fine product of an age incapable of itself
the blunt jolt of breath pushing out at you
I fear the music fizzles [through?] space
learn to connect and think not
no self?  I am a little uptight, if you want to know the truth

Host Dodie Bellamy reintroduced us immediately to Bolinas' Joanne Kyger,
who read us her New York and Buddhism-inspired work, such as:

Ahoy! Electronic nightmare! [a poem addressed to the television, of course]
new-age metaphysical smoothies
constant creation of self is a tricky mess
the nothingness bound to get sucked into the bag
[Joanne's description of NY skinny-left-margin poets working:  "Bang!
Bop-a-bop.  Bang!  Bop-a-bop"]
all of a sudden the space between raindrops was filled with rain
but what about hoarding ideas and feelings?
Ouch!  bangs shin on buddha

The audience included Stephanie Baker and Nicole at the door, Kevin Killian
on lead Tab, and Renee Gladman, Elizabeth Robinson, Steve Dickison and Tina
Rotenberg, Michael Price, Sarina, Duncan McNaughton, Charlie Palau, Rob
Hale, Tom Stolmar, Ed Ainsworth, Etel Adnan and Simone Fatel (my spelling
undoubtedly needs help here) overdubbing handclaps.

Duncan and Jean McNaughton hosted a lovely gathering at their new Mission
home after the reading.

Thanks for wonderful, thorough reports from Amittai & Maria.  Glad to hear
Charles Bernstein is a new formalist.  If he finds a stable identity he
can join the Providence School.  We're publishing a Prov School
anthology in 1978 - watch for it - focusing on poetic/political problems
from a red shift perspective.

From where I sit today, the issues of poetry & literacy seem less interesting
than the connection between poetry & storytelling & mythology.  Maybe it's
just the pale green appearing on all the trees now.  It's Persephone,
Orpheus in the land of the dead.  Nativerican mythology is full of
Orpheus stories. It's Dylan's basement tapes.  Poetry doesn't feed your
liberation it possesses you.  You can vote for literacy, that's fine:
the literate poet will continue to write form letters on stock themes.
It's something else, not power, not convention.  It's in between
Authority (sleepwalking) and Will (sleepwalking).  It's a big wind,
I say.  Beyond who's in charge or who's down under. Plot. Drama. Story.
Recognizing its human power in this way will help see what it MIGHT
mean in a political sense. Sing, sing along in sing-sing...

I thought he was a nude formalist, but maybe the impurer has knew close.

Please read this VERY IMPORTANT petition!  I hope you will then sign
it and pass it along to everyone you know.  We've got to be active in
saving these important institutions!  Please sign!  Thanks!

This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of
 $1.12/year of their taxes,  a petition follows. If you sign, please
forward on to others (not back to  me).  If not, please don't kill it --
send it to the email address listed here:

wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu

PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major
cutbacks  in funding.  In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce
spending costs and streamline their services, some government officials
believe that the funding currently going to these programs is too large
a
portion of funding  for something which is seen as "unworthwhile".
Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person
per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in
total.

A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of
Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense
and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding.

Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have
13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.
Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill.  The goal each
year is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year,
which
is October

1.The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of
support for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making
our voices heard.

  Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends if you
believe  in what we stand for. This list will be forwarded to the
President
of the  United States, the Vice President of the United States, and
Representative Newt Gingrich, who is the instigator of the action to cut
funding to these worthwhile programs.

If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th etc. signer of this
petition,  please forward a copy to:
wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu.

If that address is inoperative, please send it to:
kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu.

This way we can keep track of the lists and organize them.

Forward this to everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs
alive.

Thank you.

To whom it may concern:

Lou Stathis, editor and author, died between twelve and three
a.m.  on 5/4/97. There will be a wake on Tuesday and a burial
Wednesday. All sincerely interested friends are welcome to write
for more information.

All best always,

Rob Hardin

PS: Lou was the editor of Reflex, the pulp series for ReSearch,
the DC Vertigo line, and the author of the experimental music
review column in the 70's French-inflected comic, Heavy Metal.
(His column's influence was the only lasting effect of that
enterprise.) He was also the author of several whipsmart essays
on alternative culture.

Among those he helped were Samuel Delaney, Kathy Acker, John Shirley,
James Ellroy, David Wojnarowicz, and lesser lights such as yours truly.
He taught generations about alt culture and what's more, he was kind,
sarcastic, and never spoke of his own work when he had the chance to
mention other writers.

Your suffering is over,
but the rest will be remembered.
Sic itur ad astra.
No conduit can be lost.

Interested to read of RJ performance just after setting down ARK on the
desk.  Steve, Kevin et al, I wonder how you heard the 'historic epic'
disclaimer--I hear plenty of affinity (if not influence) of Zukofsky in
Ark, if not the dense history of Cantos/Max/Patterson.  What do we do
with a non-historic epic?  Music as much as ark-i-text-ure seems to
undergird the poem.

Anyone else reading ARK at present?  Anyone know if RJ is coming through
Buffalo/Toronto area?  I've not even heard a tape of him reading.

My personal opinion is that NPR/PBS probably AREN'T worth saving.  Many
folks I know refer to 'em as Corporate Public Broadcasting, and with good
reason.  Mark P.

Thanks, Mike Magee, for very interesting comments about Puritanism,
Antinomianism, literacy, William James, Frederick Douglass, and W. E. B.
Du Bois.  Your comment about Baraka's career (and attitude towards things
"Western") coincides well with my own impression that he was much better
when he was LeRoi Jones--not a very popular opinion these days, I dare
say.  In fairness, I must say that Baraka _was_ witty at times--his
reading was not without wit.  It's just that the bullshit outweighed
the wit, for me.

Maria, yes, we have very different impressions of the difference between
Algarin and Baraka.  Granted, I came in late.  But I very distinctly
remember Algarin saying, "We need new theories ... we need theories ..."
while being interrupted and sniped at by Baraka.  My impression was that
Baraka felt that there was enough "theory" in classical CP-style
Marxism--history is a history of class struggle, etc.--that "theory"
in the sense of poststructuralism was just a lot of bourgeois claptrap.
That was quite consistent with his general anti-academic and anti-
intellectual tone throughout both his comments (the ones I heard) and
his reading.  So I really have no idea why you thought Algarin was
anti-theory and Baraka pro-theory.  It's not that either one was anti
or pro, it's that Algarin was for innovativeness in theory (90s)
whereas Baraka thought we had damn well enough theorizing forever,
and we should just get on with the molitov cocktails.

Baraka was yelling so loud that I wore foam-rubber earplugs
(fortunatly still in my very bourgeois blazer pocket from the ultra-
bourgeois plane ride), so I could hear him as _loud_ after I put
the plugs in but didn't have to suffer permanent hearing loss.

Somebody else asked me to elaborate on the paper about _HOW(ever)_.
The gist of it was that the magazine provided a _hypertext_ before
the electronic technology was available to make it happen in the
current sense.  The magazine was short and printed on paper, stapled,
so it was very cheap to subscribe.  It contained notes about the
work presented in a general way (called ... ugh! ... I forget ...
something like "In Question" or something--Brian, help!), and
above the specific literary texts were "Working Notes," either
by the author or the editors, either thematic or biographical
or both, or artistic in some other way.  The notes whose name
I can't remember would start on the first page and be continued
later, surrounding the literary texts.  The whole thing was put
together by a collective.  So the authorship was multiple but
not totally effaced.  There were all sorts of interactions among
the texts on the pages.

As promised, I'll try to cover the rest of the conference
shortly--perhaps after I finish the undergrad papers or something.
Anyway, I totally agree with Maria (!) about Eliot Katz.  Eliot
Katz was the "warmup band" for Sonia Sanchez and then Robert Hass.
They were all wonderful in very different ways.  Katz is, indeed,
a "Ginsberg epigone" as Brian said, but he has even more self-
effacing humor than Ginsberg, and a kind of freshness and
cheerful exuberance that I found quite enchanting.  In the center
of his reading was a long, Ginsbergesque (but very funny) poem
directed to the 20th century and urging it, oratorically, to hurry
up and die already.  It was quite hilarious, but also very poignant,
as he recalled many of the horrors of the 20th century, both
on the large scale (the holocaust) and personally (relatives of
Katz's lost in the holocaust; friends of Katz's who died of AIDS
or committed suicide).  This last--the references to young people
dying of disease or suicide--formed a powerfully poignant allusion
to Ginsberg's _Howl_ and _Kaddish_.  The whole poem--and the others--
were quite ingenious at the same time as they were very compelling.

One other thing I left out in the last posting.  When Altieri posed
that challenge to Tricia Rose and Charles Bernstein, Bernstein
responded (better than Rose, I thought) by talking about purposeful
_frauds_ in the history of poetry.  It may have been at that point
that he said the sentence that Hass later quoted, "Poetry fakes
nothing actually."  It was either there or in his talk about
the Difference that Poetry Makes.  Well, it was a running theme.
I don't _really_ think that testimony/witnessing really _does_
fit in with the idea of poetic fraud (even if we consider such
"holy frauds" as the Deuteronomic corpus)--i.e., you're not supposed
to _know_ that it's a fraud, if it is.  That was the point that
the two of them didn't want to get into very much, since it's
something of an irresolvable question, I think.

again we remember differently: it was my memory that altieri got up, said
he had a question about tricia rose's paper, and then asked charles
bernstein to respond!! fond as i am of charlie, it seemed to be precisely
that kind of erasure of black female subjectivity that we need
some...retooling of...? in other words, charles was specifically called on
to speak FOR tricia, after the question had been posed, ostensibly, to her
--so no wonder he struck you as more articulate than her; it was a set up,
albeit unintentional.

In response to the query about whether papers from the "Poetry & Public Sphere"
shindig would be published: it seems that the organizers are looking to set up
a web-page with versions of the papers & ongoing discussion.  They're aiming to
have it up by the beginning of June.  You could confirm this by checking in
with them at poetry97@fas-english.rutgers.edu.

I don't think I want to try to supplement Maria's & Amitai's full-dress ac-
counts of the conference (nor do I have the energy to do so).  But here are
some memorable quotes out of my notebook:

At the panel on "Diversity in Avant-Garde Publishing," the moderator, Burt
Kimmelman said (it might have been part of the statement for discussion origi-
nally circulated to the panelists): "There may never again be a separate 'poe-
try' ..."
At the same panel, Charles Alexander (who showed some excellent slides of some
of the books he's made: pornography for book-fetishists) described an exercise
he once did with a group of school-kids, in which they had to make an acrostic
poem using the letters of their own names.  A kid name Gabriel wrote: "Gay An-
gels Break Rules In Every Language."  Big applause; best poem of the day.
And still at that panel, Ed Foster spoke somewhat caustically of true vs. per-
cevied centers & margins in the institutions of poetry.  Adrienne Rich, he
said, stands "dead center" in the mainstream; and he spoke of her "undeserved
aura of victimization."  Ouch.

At the roundtable on "The Difference That Poetry Makes," Altieri pursued the
the  motif of "the street" (as the place of "authenticity"), & remarked some-
thing to the effect that yes, the street is the place where one lives, but we
shouldn't forget that it is also a means of getting to where others live.
At the same roundable, Michael Taussig (whom I understood almost not at all)
said something about "Digging into language so as to out-constract constructed-
ness ...."

At the panel on African-American Aesthetics/Sound Poetry, the guy called Beans
had a lot of illuminating things to say,but I was listening rather than writing
... however, right at the end, Tracie Morris, who was moderating, said some-
thing memorable about the speed of commercial appropriation of popular creativi
ty: "Now they can take something away from you & sell it back to you in a
Sprite commerical in 6 months, when it used to take them 2 years ...."

At the roundtable mysteriously called "Locations of Poetry," Charlie Altieri
said: "Social dreaming keeps us sane."  And he also talked about a contemporary
wisdom poetry, the purpose of which would be "to find a 'we' that can be will-
ed."

I was too exhausted by the time to closing roundtable to take notes, though
Bob Holman & James Haba, in particular, said things worth recording.

I'm not a great fan of Alicia Ostriker's, but she had some of the best quotes.
She quoted (without identifying the source) a definition of postmodernism:
"Postmodernism is modernism without the hope."
She quoted Adrienne Rich: "To be a feminist is to have the nerves of a mid-
wife."
And she quoted the rabbis (but which one?): "It is not incumbent on you to fin-
ish the task.  Nor are you free to give it up."
I recommend reciting the latter in the morning upon rising & again in the eve-
ning before going to bed.

The somewhat elliptical refs. to the Baraka / Algarin dustup are of
interest to one (this one) who has known of both a long time.  Algarin has
had his own anti-theory moments -- and of course, in the years immediately
preceding his movement into Marxism Baraka denounced that particular
theory as useless white stuff --

but it's important to know that these two have been associated for decades
-- I first met Algarin through Baraka's introduction -- and many of
Baraka's short plays have been produced at Algarin's performance space --

as for "he was better when he was LeRoi Jones" == well, I know I was
better then -- but I continue to think that this way of splitting up his
work doesn't really get us anywhere -- If you look at all of his work, you
find that there were moments of agit-prop before, and that there continue
to be moments of real innovation now -- It's hard for me sometimes to take
seriously the "theory" of a person who once thought Hoxa a serious
theorist, but Baraka continues to have much to say that does interest me
-- as for Algarin's theory, I simply have no idea what theories he
advances now --

I guess all I'm saying, all I can say since I wasn't there at Rutgers, is
that I know enough of both men to see that the confrontation can't
usefully be understood as academic vs antiacademic, theory vs practice,
early Jones vs present Baraka etc -- even ,,, or perhaps especially, if
that's how the combatants themselves presented it --

______
on a quite different note:

have just spent two days at Stanford -- Friday, in between listening to
fascinating tapes of C.L.R. James, I had an interesting lunch meeting with
Hilton Obenzinger, whose _New York on Fire_ you should all know, followed
by a great poetry reading by Hank Lazer --

Saturday, Susan Dunn and Maeera Shreiber hosted a one day conference
sponsored by the Humanities Center -- I've been trying for years to
promote better communications among the area universities, and this
conference may help advance that cause -- in the course of the day, among
several good papers, I got to hear Hank Lazer's "resisting the Rhetoric of
Wonder," whose title enacted the very rhetoric it addressed! -- Charles
Altieri brought us some aftershocks from his Rutgers panel and Marjorie
Perloff presented material from the Yasusada essay I didn't get to hear in
Denver -- this last prvoked some intersting responses -- including the
suggestion that one of the respondents to Marjorie's _Boston Review_ essay
on this might himself be a hoax (I have my doubts on this score, even
though the letter is oddly written, as the only reason advanced for the
belief that there is no such person was that the believer had never heard
of him as someone in Japanese studies) --

and a great dinner hosted by the hosts at the end of the day -- I was
having such a good time talking to everybody that I almost missed my train
home,, which might have caused me to violate Palo Alto's newly enacted
anti-sit-lie statute (and no, it's not a law that says you can't lie) --

------
in the same vein

also at Stanford May 8-10, for those in the area --

a conference on "Movements of the Avant Garde"  I'll have to miss most of
the sessions myself, but will try to get there for Saturday's
presentations -- Several speakers from South America, Europe, even
Arizona! the program looks exciting -- you can get info at:

http://www-leleand.stanford.edu/~conlon/avantgarde.html

says here the event is "free and open to the public"

just don't sit on the sidewalk in Palo Alto--home of the derriere garde

This is a call for help from anyone who might know:

The fourth sonnet of Gwendolyn Brooks's sequence, "The Children of the
Poor," begins, in my *Selected Poems* (54), "First fight. Then fiddle."
In the new *Norton* (1587), the poem begins "First flight. Then
fiddle."  Does anyone know if the *Norton* "flight" rather than "fight"
is a misprint, or did Brooks at some time change the word?  If she did,
when? "Flight" has its own sort of fit in the sonnet, but not quite the
same as "fight."

Thanks.

BTW - Thanks to everyone for great posts about the Poetry and the Public

at Stanford and really enjoyed the presentations by Robert Kaufman (The End
of Negative Capability) and Barbara Guest, Marjorie Perloff's cogent talk
about Yasusada, Hank Lazer's talk about anti-wonder - especially enjoyed
the Kit Robinson stuff at the end - and Al Gelpi's really mad talk about
Jack Kerouac and Robert Lowell at Lowell House (not together) at Harvard -

Well, Pat, perhaps Kaufman has taught too many composition classes and,
like me, finds himself increasingly "irritable" about "reaching after
fact and reason"... I dunno, but I'd like to. Does "The End" mean
"The Aim"? The Teleology of Negative Capability? Adrift twixt Scylla &
Charybdis? Oarless past the Sirens, rudderless too, all the sailors
sighing into the sail? In what spirit should one listen to a lecture
called "The End of Negative Capability"? Does it imply a prediction? We
can only wait to see whether Kaufman will post his piece for the list--
but whether to wait languidly or impatiently I can't quite tell (at least
not till I've read it, I suppose... & even then...)...

Hi --

I wasn't there & know naught of this debate (if it is one), but at risk of
stating the obvious: no doubt the phrase
"The End of Negative Capability"
is modeled after the well-ballyhooed phrase
"The End of History"
(by that economics-theory chappie from Stanford U. meseems)

"end" thus meaning more "final phase" than "objective" (presumably)

(unlike Jorie Graham's "The End of Beauty" which was presumably more
on the teleological end of the "end" teeter-totter) --

one thinks of "endgame," Mr. Kasparov not specifically --
more like, "a new phase of poetry w/o Mr. Eliot" (??)
(hey pardon my unknowing as to particulars of Kaufman)

Rob Kaufman is not on this list - The talk he gave, of which I initially
posted only a partial title, was complexly supportive of the idea and
activity of Negative Capability - The specifics of Keats scholarship (when
certain things were said in letters etc.) which he included were of much
interest to me - I enjoyed the way Kaufman followed the changes in Keats'
approach to his own idea -

 The full title was "The End of Negative Capability, Coda from Barabara
Guest". The piece  was written _in opposition_ to claims that Negative
Capability, in its various transmutations, is either dead or merely
"aestheticist". He brought in Adorno and there was a short part about
Barbara Guest at the end which led into her very thoughtful reading and
presentation. I can't do his argument justice, and the talk that was given
was part of a longer article, but I will post to the list when I know where
it is going to be published.

Citoyens!

Over the last few weeks on the list, there have been offers to get copies
of various chapbooks, etc. I'd strongly recommend that you get hold of
_Witz 5.1_, Sylvester Pollet's _Backwoods Broadsides_, and _Shadows: New
and Selected Dialogues on Poetics_ from Mark Wallace and Jeff Hansen.

Here's another clue for you alll-ll-ll....

"There is no such thing as language."
              (statement by Mark Wallace in a dialogue from _Shadows_)

Much good work by everybody in making space for the various poetries.

a bientot,
Steven

Maria,

i just saw Tracie Morris at the St. Mark's 30th anniversary symposium this
weekend.
she read saturday nite with Amiri Baraka,  Todd Colby,  and Dael
Orlandersmith.  i enjoyed her reading,  her energy,  her rhythm,  her
musicality (she does an incredibly good vocal "scratch"),  but i had some
problems with it.  i kept
wondering,  what does it mean?: a scratch appropriated from rap music.  and
what meaning does this poetry have,  beyond the limited meaning conveyed
in a parity of words repeated over and over?  for instance,   she
did "middle passage" which is,
essentially,  the song of a female slave on a slave ship.  i think there
were some words interspersed with the wordless chanting/singing.  the
chant/song was quite beautiful,  but  i wanted it to give more meaning  (i
suppose it wasn't enough
music to give the ineffable meaning of music,  and wasn/t enough words to
give the meaning in language.)  i/m fascinated with its creation,  the
fact that there is a Tracie Morris who creates this wonderful and
difficult work,  and that it is,  in some inexplicable,  wonderful way,
poetry,  but i must say,  the limit in its meaning holds me off to a
certain degree,  or maybe i hold myself from it because of the lack of
meaning.  i spoke to her afterwards and asked if she had seen sonia
sanchez read -she had,  earlier that night!- and if she knew sonia's
"middle passage,"  which sonia performed at Rutgers -which Tracie didn't
know.  sonia,  i think conveys a gret deal more meaning in sticking to
WORDS.  true,  she does repeat chunks of them several times,  AND begins
the piece with a burst of quietly intense hysterical laughter that seeps
into the piece at various points,  BUT the depth of the piece lay in
sonia's unwavering attention to the speaker's THOUGHTS.  (i'm
paraphrasing and guessing at
line breaks here)  trying to convey the horror of the journey,
the female speaker moves through its various aspects:  "It was the boat/ the
boat/ the boat/  It was/  the boat"...she moves on to "It was/  the
raping/  the raping/  the raping..."  so we are always held at
breath-point with this woman and her experiences.  sonia's reading was
surely one of the high points of the Rutgers conference for me. it's
interesting that Tracie says the experience of the slave ship is
ineffable,  would account for her translation (sublimation?)
(transsubstantiation?) of experience into almost pure sound. towards the
end of Tracie's reading,  i felt the cognitive part of my brain shutting
down in fatigue and frustration,  although i cherish this struggle of
language and sound.  poetry is expansive,  never ceasing to surprise in
its diversity and inovation.

If you're wondering about line breaks in Sonia Sanchez's "improvisation,"
I believe you can find it improvised yet again in one of her recent
collections -- title escapes me at the moment -- "Wounded in the House of
a Friend" or something along those lines  (my books are on the other side
of the continental divide -- forgive me my memory) --

I have to admit it's neither music enough nor poetry enough for me -- I've
heard this "improvisation" enough times now that I could probably do it
myself as lip synch --

Maryemma Graham is doing a Summer Institute on the Middle Passage in
literature -- I suspect the deadlines for applications have passed -- but
I'll try to get a report on the proceedings from somebody later in the
year --

Hello!

        I also attended that reading, having missed both Baraka's &
Morris' reading [though not Morris' right-on panel appearance] at Rutgers
last week, and must agree very much with Kyle about Morris & Sanchez
[whom I also heard with Bob Haas at Rutgers]. Dael (sp?), too, keeps the
words in focus, as does Baraka, who counterpoints scat with signifying in
a way I find very engaging, despite Algarin's demurs at Rutgers about the
status of theory or lack of same in the 60s' push in which Amiri
persists, indefatigable & not to suffer such dissing lightly. I really
enjoyed much of Morris' performance [and some of Colby's, too], but
primarily as just and only that, as Kyle says, poetic, but hard to call
poetry without dilution of the term. In fact, it seems that much of the
repetition in such performance pieces functions as a synchronic analogue
[by accretion or, better, intensification] of the recursion-over-time
[the diachrony available from the page] of what I've known throughout my
life as "poetry." Such insistence upon repetition seems to me
compensatory, as if to forestall the possibility that the audience
might not choose to reread the work by force-feeding at worst [as one
does a goose to disease its liver for pate] or by risking overdose at
best [as if assuming that the 'message' acts like peanuts: "here, have
ONE"--obviously impossible since, as Balke said, "less than All cannot
satisfy Man." Well, yeah, but not necessarily all at once...]. In fact,
Charles Bernstein, in perhaps the least 'gossipy' segment of a "Gossip"
session at St. Mark's the afternoon of the Baraka/Morris/et al. reading,
made a germane but perhaps unpopular point by saying that the relatively
straightforward, unadorned, individual voice of the poet true to the
words read from the page offered the most radical instance of the art,
even moreso, he suggested, than the histrionics [however artful and
engaging] of the primarily 'performance artist.' I.e., rests, too,
constitute an essential part of the music. [Whereupon I, too, shall, for
the moment, rest.]
Best,
Dan Zimmerman

Copies of this project do still exist.  Just to clarify, the Lab Book is
not the result of a workshop, but a project I organized around the fact of
so many different writers being here at SUNY-Buffalo...its procedure is the
beginning of what became the format for issue #1 of _Chain_ (the journal I
edit with Juliana Spahr).

Here's an offer: A copy of the Lab-Book is yours for free with a two-issue
subscription to _Chain_. The next issue of _Chain_ (#4), on "Procedures,"
will be out this summer, with work by Jackson Mac Low, Clarinda Mac Low,
Caroline Bergvall, Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop, Leslie Scalapino, Janet
Zweig, Margaret Morton, Joan Retallack, Tina Darragh, Bill Fuller,
Harryette Mullen, Maria Damon, Kevin Killian and many MANY more. Chain #5
will be on "other languages."

Subscriptions are $10 for one issue, $18 for two. Copies of issues 3:1 and
3:2 on "Hybrid Genres" are still available. You can order either by
e-mailing me at josman@acsu.buffalo.edu or by sending a request to Chain at
215 Ashland Avenue, Buffalo, NY  14222.  Mention if you would like a copy
of the Lab-Book as well. Thanks,

Jena

Subject:      negative capability

I looked up n.c. in the Princeton Encyclopedia, irritably reaching after
fact & reason.  Absorption of the poet's personality in the process of
composition.  Gusto in identification, empathy, sympathy, mimicry to the
extent of seeming to be without character or moral compass (Iago interests
the poet as much as any good or heroic figure).  Contentment with half-knowledg
e without irritable reaching after fact & reason.  The poem reflects these
motives - it is a sympathetic, magnetic form that draws its audience out
of themselves into new appreciation of mystery, beauty, truth, etc.

Princeton SAYS the concept developed in 2 different/opposed directions:
1) Wildean idea of CONSCIOUS ambiguity - the mask, the persona; 2)
modernist idea of "sincerity in objectivity" (objective correlative).
Both quite different from Keats' original, less calculated(?) idea of
left-brainedness(?)...

Does it sound like Keats is saying the poet exhibits traits based on
the deep motivation of composition - absorption in a kind of dream-
object which unifies (as dreams do) various kinds of beauty & meaning
in a sort of uncanny, lifelike, "unexplained" meaning - a dream-action,
a mini-drama.  And is this impulse based on an "overdetermined" SET
of impulses - personal interest in matching/re-making past poems (which
hold the same fascination-grip on the poet as on audience in general) -
unconscious social disequilibriums or goals - talent as energeia working
itself out -  & is all this just romantic extra-poetic
limburger or is the uncanny in poetry (the tragicomic acting-out) actually
the essential thing & what is beautiful about it sings the mockingbird ha ha.

Ken,

I didn't hear any disclaimer of influence in RJ's remarks. More that he *is*
working in the long poem tradition of Pound, Williams, Olson, Zukofsky, but
that his poem was to be in some sort of (poetic?) "present" & that in
distinction to his forbears, the historical would not enter the poem
(explicitly, at least--& that raises a number of questions, doesn't it?). Ron
has always pointed to LZ as a major influence & it's certainly there in the
music of _Ark_. In fact, he read the "Spire on the Death of LZ." He pointed
w/ pride that only he & LZ had managged to "finish" their poems. I don't see
that he draws off the others so explicitly in Ark; I see the Olson influence
more clearly in his early books, _Valley of the Many-Colored Grasses_ & _The
Book of the Green Man_. Jonathan Williams would be the other obvious name to
mention.

Is it useful to talk of _Ark_ as an epic? or _"A"_ for that matter?

I asked about _RADI    OS_ & he said that is now projected to be included in
a collected other works, to be titled the "Outworks." Also to include
groupings titled "Obelisk" & the "Reflecting Pool", & that he felt he needs
some greenery in his work & is working on the "Shrubbery."

Anyone in Buffalo willing to talk about the LZ happenings there?

all best,

The rabbi is Tarfon, from _Pirke Abot_ (_The Wisdom of the Fathers_), and the
task is the study of Torah, so Brian's recommendation would take us all
to the yeshiva.  I've seen this aphorism quoted in the most outlandish
contexts, including at the end of an argument supporting nuclear
deterence.  Rabbis Tarfon's other famous saying is a better way to
start the day:  "The day is short, the work is plentiful, the laborers are
sluggish, and the reward is abundant, and the master of the house presses."

I'll bite, Charles (since I've been thinking and reading around Jack
Clarke's _In the Analogy_ in similar terms). What do you think? Or is

Aldon and others--Re: Michael Davidson's talk.  His bottom line was that
cultural studies work tends to privilege narrative over non-narrative forms.
 Michael pointed out a range of work, much of it from the Caribbean, that is
susceptible (that may be the wrong word!) to the work of cultural
studies--work by Brathwaite and others.  I'm hoping he gives the talk to
non-poetry types as well as to us.
This reminds me that Lois-Ann Yamanaka's first novel from Farrar, Straus &
Giroux includes a bio note that refers to her first book as a "prize-winning
book of short stories" when, in fact, it is a book of poems (poems that are
more hard hitting than is her prose).  I notice that the paperback version of
the book corrects that claim.  A job candidate here (at the University of
Hawai'i) gave a brilliant talk a couple of years back in which she reported
that Yamanaka had referred to her book of poems as a series of "novellas."
 She then went ahead and talked about the book for upwards of an hour with no
mention of its being a book of poems.
Michael's interventions are thus most welcome.

Re: Lois Ann Yamanaka
In her recent reading at UCSD she referred to the book in question as,
alternately, a book of stories and a novel. She also read from an earlier
small-press book of poems which struck me as narratives not overly different
from the "stories" except in length and not something that I would call
poetry despite its entertainment value.

Brief (sort of) Announcement

The server which houses n/formation
(choengmon.lib.utah.edu/~calexand/nonce)
was broken into in mid-April. Fortunately
the hackers were not malicious, &, once
taken down, it provided good opportunity
to upgrade the system, but my sys admin
is nervous as a cat these days
                                            --So,
n/formation is temporarily unavailable, it
seems, to users outside of our system. I've
asked to be moved to a different server,
& should be finding out about that very
soon. In any case, this is just to apologize
to those of you who may have tried to
access the periodical (sporiadical?) &
received the mysterious "Forbidden"
message.

I'll post to the list when we're back online.

Alright, then, I'll chime in with a few recommendations:

_Story for a Sascatchewan Night_ & _Visible Visions_,
2 from ["our own illustrious"] Douglas Barbour (of the North),
& both excellent books. I'm particularly taken with some of
the sound poems in the latter, which are a lot of fun to perform.
It's hopeless to characterize the work as usual, but for what it's
worth I'll say that _Story..._ is, among other things, an extended
play on & against the conventions of narrative--in which stories
move into & out of narrative & anti-narrative space, the latter
often revealing more than the former...

at any rate, don't let my bad description keep you from
reading these good books.

Also--dunno how many times I've said this, but one more
won't hurt by now:
            Peter Inman's _Vel_ (O Books): read it.

I'm outside the loop on this kind of discussion, so I may have missed
something. Why are dramatic monologues formally anticolonial (formally, as
opposed to their content, oy vey)? Is "Giuseppe da barber he gotta da mash"
formally anticolonial? Is Robert Browning?
Another thing: Is the point about Yamanaka's poetry's local importance that
it fills a lacuna in Hawaiian culture by creating a body of work that
corresponds somehow with what was current in other places fifty years ago?
Should someone write Hawaiian Augustan satire because that was missed out on
too?
All I know of Yamanaka's work is what I heard her read. I thought the prose
was interesting. And I thought the poetry was prose. Maybe I'd feel
differently if I knew more, and on ne discute pas, etc.

Long texts should be called something else.  The context of "epic" was
getting pretty indeterminant and squishy even before the early cantos, The
Bridge, Paterson etc got started.  No question that something about
grandeur of gesture, not to mention containing history, was in the minds
of various "High Modernists," to whom the word was important.  But the sum
total of the poetic universe we have now, at 2000 or so, has outlived any
focused accuracy for the term.  (..among other things you could execute
Jed Rasula's great pun, and point out that "containing history" can be
understood as a police action: as in american anti-communist "containment"
in the fifties).  Lots of other reasons I find it unuseful and
hyperacademic: what is Rimbaud's Saison en Enfer?  It's a long modernist
text which has little truck with the models "epic" implies.  Those models
themselves don't really live for us, as they did when ode and sonnet etc.
were major framing gestures in lyric poetry.

There's always been this impulse to assure people that something is
primarily narrative. At least in our culture.  The non-narrative is
threatening--to the reader and therefore to marketing possibilities.  I
remember when Bob Dylan's fairly interesting prose text Tarantula came
out--Despite the fact that by any conceivable standard it was "poetry",
and utterly nonlinear and non-narrative, it was firmly marketed (and
discussed) as "Dylan's novel."  Many of L. Scalapino's long prose pieces
are refered to routinely as novels and stories; I was interested a few
years ago to hear her read sections from various such pieces, always
refering to them as poems...

Actually, everybody and his brother were writing epics in the 16th-17th
century--it was a felt need of newly consolidating nation-states that there
be a national epic, in emulation of the Greeks and Romans; these were often
tied, like Virgil, to Homer. In writing a national epic the author was at
once claiming legitimacy for his national-political entity and its
institutions and parity with the ancients for his culture. There were also a
slew of religious epics.

File this under unsleeping dogs: Perhaps the decline of the traditional epic
corresponds inversely to the rise of the idea of the individual, or the cult
of the individual, as it may now be called in many of its manifestations,
that is, in its decay from an invigorating gesture in the dialectical
exchange between society and person to the rampant abuses of Me-ism which
ironically play back into the hive mentality of consumerist ideology. (Duby
and his colleagues address much of this in their "epic" _A History of
Private Life_ - of which I've only read Vol. 2 on the medieval period).

ARK is "epic" in scope, certainly - for playing out a single set of ideas or
themes sonata-like across a range of variations. It is not epic in the sense
that it celebrates the martial spirit or ethos of an era, its arete (not the
same thing). I don't think Milton wld recognize it as an "epic." Or wld he?
There is the same concern with cosmic or extra-personal scale, for instance.
An interesting notion to play with.

Subject:      Re: epic/narrative - Flowchart

Any view on candidacy of John Ashbery's book-length *Flowchart* for
some epic-ish rubric?  The booksuggests, at least, something akin to
so-called "epic ambition" --

In a noteable phrase in the 1st page or so, the poet refers to "the
published city" [something like "who in the published city . . ?"-- and
Ashbery thereby invokes (I think) the notion of a poem endeavoring to
serve as epic for such an imaginal city-state (comprised of the readership
of such publications . . .)

As for "the published city" -- along related lines, the opening salvo in
Merwin's recent *Travels* says "But who in the total city" -- the total
city of Merwin being, I think, not too dissimilar from the published city
of Ashbery.  Both invoke a contemporary literary readership as "city."

One critical jibe (I guess) at Ashbery's tome characterized it as "more
chart than flow" (prob. in the pages of *Poetry* or some such).  But it
does have a lot of flow to it, withal (from such of it as I've read so far) . .
and the opening passage anyway (which I've read a number of times)
seems to suggest an attempt to reconfigure the notion of what-is-epic.
Or so it seemed to me . . .

        Would anyone mind providing a brief definition of "narrative"
poetry, as opposed to "non-narrative" poetry? All poetry is linear, I
think, in the strict sense, insofar as language moves forward in time ...
must narrative poetry specifically "tell a story" to be considered
narrative, then? And why should the lack of a story be considered
subversive, as some people have intimated?
        Thanks, Evan

What I was suggesting was that maybe all poetry could be read as narrative.
A lot of the best poetry is simply beautiful word painting.  But paintings
tell stories too.  By narrative I'm thinking of storytelling, plot.
Of course this is stretching things to the invisible amorphous.  But
in the context of the "pub sphere" discussions of late I just wanted
to reiterate Aristotle's interesting definition of "poet" as maker of
plots, weaver of verbal actions.  Maybe it was Blarnes or Spandrift -
- but if this be I [who suggested non-narrative poetry was subversive]
then... I is another [mortal dust].

Well, I was just rereading Clarke's _From Feathers to Iron_ and found
this provocative (for me) passage from John Thorpe's terrific intro:

        Clarke doesn't envision the epic as a literary genre so much
        as an inherent narrative comprehension, wherever there's an
        interplay of story with its telling. Since this narrative
        crops up everywhere on earth for the 4,000 years preceding
        us, he considers it innate enough to be built upon [or, say,
        improvised on], and acts accordingly.

Thorpe's understanding, by returning this mode of narrative to
a kind of knowing [both out of _gna_ as is gnosis], frees us from from
all the scholastic nit-picking over genre, and delivers us back to the
creative imagination. And specifically, what Clarke calls the
strengthening method of world completion.

Yes, lots of people have used epic badly, and used it for purposes not
germane to us, but so what? You could equally argue that the English
sonnet is linked to the rise of colonialism, as both can be seen to
arise at the same time with Henries VII and VIII, but what's that got
to do with Bernadette Mayer? Or Tom Mandel?

The phrase "epic scope" seems invented for Cecil B. DeMille movies,
and pretty much useless for the purposes of poetry. Surely there are
different kinds of Long Poems, and our expectations of them are
determined by how they interplay with the past, present, and future.
Why let Pound define it for you? What's he got that we ain't got?
Maybe we could see epic as a certain kind of conversation.

Interestingly, Thorpe (and Clarke) come into this conversation partly
by way of what Thorpe calls the "field self", a nifty way around that
binary contraction "individual/social" that was barking around here
last week.

All? No!

i think of some of (as eg.s) Susan Howe's, MacLow's, Cage's & Michele
Leggott's poetry as very much non-linear - in as much as there is a
randomness to the reading of specific lines/words/phrases... there is a
randomness in these cases that seems very much to me integral to their
readings and existence and is emphatically non-linear. But that wasn't the
question.

Quick query.  One of the things I have yet to report on was an absolutely
_wonderful_ panel I attended the last day of the Rutgers Poetry and the
Public Sphere conference, called "Five (Jewish) (Women) Poets."  All the
presentations were _fabulous_--mostly readings--and the discussion,
spurred largely by a provocative and moving comment by Brian McHale
(next to whom I have the privilege of sitting, as it happens), was
intense and memorable.  Anyway, afterwards, I went up to greet some
of these five wonderful poets, and was getting autographs (in which
I generally don't believe--oh, well) from Rachel Blau du Plessis
(who also doesn't believe in them), when Irena Klepfisz left the room.
Drat!  Does anybody happen to know how to get in touch with Irena
Klepfisz?  An e-mail address would be ideal, but a snail address would
do.  I have a close friend who is very interested in Yiddish, and
correspondence with Ms. Klepfisz would be just the thing for her.
People into Yiddish really need a lot of support--they have to take
a lot of abuse from the ignorant, saying things like that it is a useless
language to study, etc.

So, anybody know an address for Irena Klepfisz?  Please send this to
me backchannel (e-mail to avirama@vm.sc.edu).  Thanks!

Yes, David, I think _ Flowchart_ cld indeed qualify as an epic whose
epicness consists in its undermining of the trad. idea of the epic, though
like you, I've not read it all yet.  As Marjorie Perloff observes in her
blurb (I paraphrase) - it's related to Wordsworth's _Prelude_ (which
actually revises my earlier idea about the decline of epic and the rise of
individualism as a cultural idee fixe).

Along those lines - what about Ron Silliman's _Alphabet_? Epic in scale,
yes. But wld Ron describe it in those terms?

Evan,

I'll take a wild stab at this and hope others follow. Narrative in its most
basic sense means to tell a story in some way and while most of the time
that occurs in a linear way, it need not  necessarily do so. Language can be
circular; narrative can be circular, or collage-like. Michelle Cliff's _Free
Enterprise_ is an excellent example of a contemporary novel told in a
non-linear fashion. But even in Conrad you can find the traditional
linearity of narrative undergoing a subversion. Paintings can also be
considered as forms of narration, as Louis Marin points out in his essay
"Toward A Theory of Reading in the Visual Arts." In the same way, the
evening news plays out as a narrative thru the deployment of its components:
first the serious news, then weather, sports and a human interest tag. Such
strategies relate less to an idea of moving thru time to achieve climax &
closure than conforming to certain assumptions of how we priortize clusters
of meaning/information and how those in turn support (or don't) our
epistemological models for viewing the world. But what is a "story" anyway?
Is it simply a description of events? Or is it the meaning we take away from
a poem or other work or art; less the meaning even than the gestalt of our
interaction with the text? This is all way underbaked and quite vague. Hope
it helps and prompts someone else to expand/elaborate.

        Would anyone mind providing a brief definition of "narrative"
poetry, as opposed to "non-narrative" poetry? All poetry is linear, I
think, in the strict sense, insofar as language moves forward in time ...
must narrative poetry specifically "tell a story" to be considered
narrative, then? And why should the lack of a story be considered
subversive, as some people have intimated?

OK -- so now I have to tell my Ashbery narrative --

few years back I was detailed to drive Ashbery from San Francisco to San
Jose for his reading that evening.  stopped at Cody's on the way and
bought a copy of Walcott's _Omeros_, which had just appeared that week.
much confusion connecting with Ashbery at his hotel, 'cause his guy in New
York had given him the wrong latitude and longitude, and even the wrong
date for the reading -- BUT, we did meet just in time, renewed
acquaintance etc -- here I am driving like the proverbial Nielsen out of
hell down the 101 to make it no more than a half hour late for the reading
(which went beautifully by the way - one of the best I've heard him give)
-- driving along I ask, "so John, have you seen this new 'epic' sort of
poem that Walcott's published."  to which Ashbery responds laughing that
yes, of course he knows of it, and he's put out because he too has this
long poem of his own,_Flow Chart_, coming out and Derek's is not only out
first, but his has more pages in it ----- epic envy, I suppose

Charles:
Thanks for that response--I guess it's questionable whether epic is
useful re: LZ or RJ given its implicitly totalizing stanze toward history.
But what's the line from 'A'--"history is best without the names"--which,
in A22/23, leaves quoted voices--a song of voices.  I like to keep the
'epic' close at hand with LZ, if only because the personal-history plays
into the poem as a 'lived-with-and-through' composition (LZ's contention
that the poetry itself obviates biography) gives Epic new possiblities.

Does long poem suffice?  LZ and RJ find it possible to finish b/c of the
nature of the design?  In Buffalo, we were talking about the way in which
'A's historical references served a different purpose than Pound's, seemed
present for the collusion of thought, as say the Davenport anecdote
related in the LZ Man/Poet volume; in conversation GD strains to
articulate a point at which LZ leaves room, returns with a 50 year old
zine in which he has an essay, opens guickly to a particular page and
indicates a paragraph more or less the twin of what GD had been trying to
say--and as GD describes it this is not a gesture of arrogance, or claim
of precedences, but dwelling in the pleasure that thoughts and lines of
poetry coincide.

To Mark Weiss--I didn't mean to suggest that Yamanaka's dramatic monologues
were de facto post-colonial.  What I did mean to say is that I take her use
of Hawaiian Creole English (pidgin) in poems that are forcefully
anti-lyrical, combined with the content of her poems, can be read as such.
 The charge of "cultural lag" has been leveled often against Hawai'i writers,
but their situation is very different from that elsewhere and thus their
methods are, as well, or the timing of their methods.  I'm not sure that I,
for one, care too much who gets there first.  If you look at the
_Premonitions_ anthology, edited by Walter Lew, however, you'll see work from
here that is more evidently postmodern than is Yamanaka's.

FLOWCHART was conceived as/ is a one hundred page poem for his mother's
death. (JA's pages, not the publishers.) Does that, if we are playing
the category-game, put the poem into another "genre" than epic? A
procedural elegy, say?

Thinking of procedural works, Allen Fisher's PLACE, hundreds of pages
long over a number of books & incorporating performances as well as
history, could be thought of as "an epic of South London" though that
genre attribution would seem  restrictive, even diminishing to the work,
which, I would argue, has an epic impulse and then exceeds that "genre"
definition on all sides.

Narrative is unavoidable as soon as you have more than one word. (In
fact, some of Celan's single words are complex narratives in
themselves!). Here's a complete narrative by Basho:

frog
pond
plop!

Amittai, Maria:  I did not make it to the Five (Jewish) (Women) Poets panel,
but I heard that everyone in the room was glowing at the end of the session.
Irena Klepfisz gave a reading in the Saturday "After Hours" session that was
terrific.  Last fall I assigned her collection of poems (about Holocaust
survival, working class women, and Yiddish as the mother tongue) in my Women's
Studies course, and it provoked amazing second-generation testimonies from the
students. I'll backchannel her permanent address in Brooklyn, but until June
you can reach her at the Jewish Studies Department at Michigan State
University.  Speaking of East Lansing, do any of my fellow MSU alumns out there
know where I can reach Marcus Cafagna (who I knew tangentially back when I
edited the RED CEDAR REVIEW)?  He gave a reading here at Rutgers in March that
I did not hear about until too late, and the email I sent to him at Carnegie
Mellon was returned. Please backchannel any info.  Thanks, KC

Hello,

New to the list here. Lurked a couple days.

As to narrative--does Ted Hughes' CROW qualify? He originally had a more
unified narrative frame, complete with a prose bit I believe, and he cut it
out. Can the result be called story, narrative, linear?

All? No!

i think of some of (as eg.s) Susan Howe's, MacLow's, Cage's & Michele
Leggott's poetry as very much non-linear - in as much as there is a
randomness to the reading of specific lines/words/phrases... there is a
randomness in these cases that seems very much to me integral to their
readings and existence and is emphatically non-linear. But that wasn't the
question.

I like a couple ideas here from Pierre - one, that maybe it's better not to
jump to call things epic, maybe there's a better explanation, which is
related to two, the reason we jump to call things epic is that epic has
sort of an automatic high culture value - important, great, necessary, etc -
which is why so many tiresome ones have been written down the ages -

but rather than redefine what the epic impulse actually is, as Mike Boughn
suggested, as some mode of originary cognition (like Olson?) - seems to
me what defines epic comes back to this social/individual thing.  Epic
tells the GROUP story.  It is a tribal recounting of things EVERYBODY had/
has a hand in.  The rise of the individual [which I am not slabbning
as TERRIBLE HORRIBLE as some posts here seem to have it] allowed for
re-positioning of "epic" - see what Joyce did to Homer, what Zukofsky did
to Pound - redefining what is "great" or all-important - but they
couldn't do it without the paradigmatically SOCIAL communal storytelling
which is epic.  Greek tragedy refocused epic in a related way, maybe.

so the challenge to the epic poet is to find techniques & allegories which
transmit that allness quality to the specific local personal idiosyncrasies
& unrepeatable events which make up the story.  Dante turning his feud with
Florence & the ghost of puppy love into the story of redeemed humankind.

Narrative I think does not mean linear, but story-telling.  I've never
seen a Clark Coolidge poem I would describe as narrative, for instance.
Or take (say) Wyatt's anthology-piece "They flee from me"...While it
describes events and interactions, and how those interactions have changed
thru time, it does so with image, metaphor and dramtic/meditative
address, depending on sonorities and rhythms to shape an emotional
complex.  It is too fixed on a specific moment of existence to be said to
tell a story.  Pound's first Canto on the other hand tells a story, for
all that its astonishing mixture of sound and goosed-up archaism is doing
something very aural (and peculiar) to the reader's ear.

Coolidge's "At Egypt" is maybe a kind of story...  Wyatt's "They flee from me"
starts like many a good tale, in medias res.  Is it possible that within the
all-narrative which is language & speech, lyric poetry is a kind of pause?
Dante puts the song-singer in Purgatory, at the beginning - who is it,
Arnaut?  anyway, he is almost held back by the power of the song - but
then pushes on with his journey/story (to the bigger chorus-finale).

Henry's response below, and in a way the whole thread (or threads: the
epic one and the narrative/linear one) are valuble for suggesting how much
these things depend on **point of view** and **working priorities**.  I
specifically brought up Wyatt because there are **narrative-like
elements** to that sonnet; but to me that don't a narrative make!  On the
other hand, lots of folks have insisted that anything (even a single word)
can resonate outward into narrative;  I move in the other direction
(because of the way I tend to see my own work: the way I think of music as
far more important than story-implying "content"); I'm more likely to see
(and value)  elements that move away from story into sound, lyric weave
and langual/imagistic tension.  Not linear so much as forces meeting
(clash).  Thus my mention of Coolidge, the best shorthand I can think of
to suggest the imperatives and promises of the non-narrative.

That's not exactly what I said, Henry. The question is whether
you see it as restricted to some strictly "literary" domain (in which
case it's all a question of arbitrary rules--hence the nit-picking
arguments about whether or not Paradise Lost or the Commedia are
REALLY epics--genre as jail), or whether it arises out of some other
relation to the world. To call that a "redefinition" is to assume the
literary/scholastic as the definition, which, I think, begs, as they
say, the question. That's been the argument all along, hasn't it? Are
the gestures and forms of poetry rules or specific ways of knowing?

It seems to me that Ark falls outside the realm of epic because its
structure is primarily architectonic and in that sense is more closely
related to Hesiod than Homer.

Falling back on the individual/group binary just confuses further
as those Ulronic contraries always will. Is the Odyssey about the
"group" or the "individual"? Ditto the Iliad.

The other one to keep in mind is David Gordon's projected ten-book poem.
Three volumes out so far: Outward, Repairs, and Rest. Stem, the next one,
or Part 1 of it, will be going to press soon. This is the epic to watch, in
my opinion. I published a section of Stem as #8 in my broadside series, and
the National Poetry Foundation publishes the whole series, so my judgment
may be clouded, but I don't think so. To excerpt from the NPF catalogue
description:
        ...its protagonist...despite a wide range of human figures, is
nothing less than the life force
       itself. Gordon, a Pound scholar and the translator of T'ang and Sung
poems and Lu Yu, dives
       deep into the seas of bacteriology, biology, philosophy, music, and
epic, and thus into time,
       myth, document, and symmetrical speculation.

there is such a thing as narrative knowledge, and any individual item or
experience will become narrative in consciousness -- but , following Mark,
I would make a distinction of convenience between a Coolidge poem like
"ing" (or whatever the title was) and "At Egypt," "Fed Drapes" etc. -- as
someone in England years ago said of nomination generally -- better to
think of these descriptors as naming a locus of shading from one area to
another than attempt to claim a sharp break between the narrative and the
non -- this many years post-structuralism it shouldn't be all that hard
for us to agree that, for instance, "narrative" and "lyric," while naming
difference, are inextricably and definitionally bound up in one another's
cloudy metahphrical arms --

No doubt about it we get stuck in the hair-splitting of Roman law or
whatever with these hoary words/genres.  Makes sense to re-look (re-
define, whatever) at the impulse of different approaches to poetry &
see if "epic" is still a useful term for what anybody's writing now.
I think that's how this thread got started?  Anyway, my point was,
no, I wouldn't call the genres "ways of knowing".  I would call them
ways of making poems.  There are a lot of people writing poems containing
oodles of history and knowledge but I wouldn't say "rethink the world
& make an epic".  That's only part of it.  Epic somehow finds the
common story - as STORY, as action, beginning middle end.  Philosophy
finds the central thought & circles around it.  Poetry imitates the
central action.  Eric Blarnes tells me he's working on an 800 pound
banter-weight class poem, 14 leagues long, centered on a tree farm
in Knickerbocker, Wisconsin.  To Eric, I say: Armes virumque canto!
or some such thingum.  - Henry Gould

I think different poems have different ratios or tensions: it's a kind of
torque: between narrative and lyric: a very tight, gem-like poem: I think
of much Hardy and much Creeley here: can be insistently narrative just as
insistently lyric: as Wyatt's loss/memory tale or Pound's Erat Hora (or o
western wind):

I'm very drawn to what Mark is saying here: my own ambition is often
towards narrative but I also find and am frequently surpsised when/that
many think I mean something much more stable, unitary, fixed, comfortable,
famaliar (you get the drill) than I mean when I say narrative:

Stein is for example a non-stop lesson in narrative:

much of Aaron Shurin's work rocks narrative like a truckload of bricks:

I'm thinking also in the sense that Donald Revell has pointed to a new
narrativity that comes after language poetry and learns from it:

but to return to Mark's wonderful point: I think there is a very human
story in the image for example: an image or a broken syntax squib can be a
construct of thought, argument, sensuality, memory: a contigent subject
breaking apart and reforming:

and part of what I really honor in Mark's poems is the musical grace with
which this urge/wave explodes:

forces do, as Mark puts it, clash: and that clash can be homeric at the
level of syntax and poesis: it's playing, language is a music: and that
involves the most epistemological reaches of what Coleridge (and Byron if
you're Jerome McGann) would have called imagination:

*Live at the Writer's House* has been aired on WXPN (philadelphia)
monthly since february 1997.  it is a one hour LIVE poetry reading - no
commercials - with 4  3-minute slots for singer/songwriter action.

The Writer's House is University of Pennsylvania's Communal Poetry
scene.  The U. gave us the recently evacuated chaplain's house (great
acoustics!) and we have poetry and fiction activity ever minute of the
day eve since.    many incredible poets have visited/read/eaten/hungout/had
drinks with us this year.  it would be a too-long-post to name them all.

This fall we begin also radio theatre and live music.  we will have a
one hour slot every week and will air what (of these three programs) we
desire :).   WXPN reaches most of southeatern PA, some of maryland and
some of western & central PA.  some of the shows may be syndicated and
then you can all pester your local public radio station to get on board.

anyone interested please backchannel.  kg

I'd say, very much so, Gwyn -- not to mention that filling up a character
named "I" with gallons of LSD is altogether a neater method of
circumventing the perils of first-person address than, say, taking
Foucault to heart: no (de)construction required.

But about epic -- its usefulness as a term: I wonder about a feature
common to many early poems thus named, the journey into hell and back.
Classics scholars can correct me, but I think that particular journey is
called "catabasis" -- and certainly then a movement from one (limited,
narrow) state to another (broader, more all-encompassing) and then, maybe,
back. Ulro to Jerusalem, Inferno to Paradiso, the Mahayana Buddhist coming
down off the mountain until all sentient beings are enlightened . . .

 . . . is that kind of "movement" narrative? It's certainly not LINEAR.
Is it naive to think a movement like that one could still exist,
post-modern and post-structuralist as we are? Some of the poems mentioned
as contemporary exemplars of epic seem to me just epic in scale, not
encompassing this broader move.

Wisdom literature, I hear some folks sneering -- we're beyond that. But
for me, if epic means anything, it means going on that journey.

I'm reading a book about the pervasiveness of an "orpheus" story in many
variations in native american storytelling.  The orpheus myth of Greece
(coming maybe originally from eastward) makes the journeyer to the
world of the dead a poet (in the stories or myths usually its "just"
a man or woman going to try to fetch lover/kin back to the living).
Does the greek version add a "reflexive" element - because this is
THE epic tale?

I'd not thought abt. this much before, but your mention (Henry) about
the Orpheus tale having poss. come from points east, reminds of the
ancient Indian myth of Savitri (the Persephone of the tale) who is rescued
from land of the dead by a certain Satyavan (the Orpheus) --

this story (of poss. interest to Mr. Blarnes) was re-told in -- hey, dig this
-- EPIC form (a full, book-length poem, including cosmic idea-sweep, and
as I recall in unrhymed iambic hexameter) by Aurobindo Ghose -- a
British-educated Bengali who turned to matters of philosophy &
spirituality after being jailed as an early 20th-century freedom fighter
(pre-Gandhi days) . . .  this is one of those books high on my
hypothetical shelf of stuff to read -- whenever (every several years) I've
run across a copy & read a half-page, have been much amazed by the
language . . . old-school style, of course . . .

A lot of questions there - but re the statement _All poetry is linear_
What about the visual text especially because it adds a twist to the
question where the visual text is performed by more than one performer who
may start at different points - the performance is linear because the
performance moves forward in time but the linearity of the text performed
may have been heavily disrupted AND there are many visual texts which are
anything but linear in the first place

In the case of epics then and now there are a multitude of devices to send
the auditor back in recollection and forwards in anticipation AND because
of the epic size of epics they are not often read as a whole - the effect
of reading a long poem more or less at a sitting can be rewarding and
enjoyable BUT long poems are often experienced in stages and or with gaps

What about _Much poetry is linear some of the time_?

Re _Long poem_ there is a Long Poem Society over here. I think that's what
it is called. Well, Bob Cobbing and I are engaged on a sequence of booklets
called Domestic Ambient Noise - way over a hundred now one responding to
another in an ever more complex pattern. Fundamentally visual on the page
and meant for impro performance - but, you know, we have words there, lots
of words, and when we don't we have letters - it's a series of poems. Well,
Bob, as Writers Forum, has been sending them booklets so they can include
DAN in their list of long poems and, as he tells it, there is a Long
Correspondence, going on as to whether or not DAN is a poem! It's a pity
Bob's not on email - but if you would like to buy the series I am sure he
would quote you a good discount for quantity

<<  Is it useful to talk of _Ark_ as an epic? or _"A"_ for that matter?


 I'll bite, Charles (since I've been thinking and reading around Jack
 Clarke's _In the Analogy_ in similar terms). What do you think? O r is
 yours a rhetorical question? >>


No, Mike, I wasn't just being a smartass. I’ve got more questions than
anything else.

Epic is a loaded term, with a lot frayed baggage. I balked at it, while
recognizing reasons for its use. I honestly don't remember if Johnson used
the term himself while talking (I suspect he did), or if it was introduced in
Steve Carl's description. RJ doesn't use it in a note at the end of _Ark_,
where, acknowledging Pound, Williams, Zukofsky & Olson as forbears he writes:
"If my confreres wanted to write a work with history in its maw, I wished,
from the beginning, to start all over again, attempting to know nothing but a
will to create, and matter at hand. William Blake would be a guiding spirit:
his advice to pay attention every moment: the very lightning, then thunder: a
voice out of a cloud." (Begs question about a poem situated outside history,
esp. given the charged, embedded 'historical' language, but that's another
thread.) He goes on, after citing Simon Watts & Le Facteur Cheval as models
of architectural bricolage, to say: "The idea of ARK came when I was able at
last to conceive of it as a structure rather than a diatribe, artifact rather
than argument, a veritable shell of the chambered nautilus, sliced and
polished, bound for Ararat unknown."

What does it mean to place one’s work in that tradition, offering a "long
poem," while disavowing any need to grapple with history? Or does he gain
clearer access into the realm of creative imagination & spirit by
sidestepping the "deeds" of history? Any long poem is not an "epic," despite
popular use of the phrases like "epic proportions." There’s lots of
interesting contemporary work that clearly situates itself through varying
strategies in relation to epic tradition: "Passages," "Song of the
Andoumboulou," "Descent of Alette," "Iovis." I guess I’m more comfortable
seeing "Ark" as making that kind of move than calling it an "epic." I
wouldn’t call the Duncan or Mackey "epic" either, though the work engages
that tradition, while I’d be more comfortable with that characterization of
the Waldman & Notley.

Against the sweeping totalizing gestures of Whitman, Pound, Olson, does "A"
offer one alternative? where the "grand narrative" gives way to the
individual poet’s attention & arrangements? _Ark_ seems to strive for LZ’s
"totality at rest." The two poems foreground the creative imagination through
their music & architectonics.

all best,

Charles

By using an already-archaic form (epic), Milton in PL seems to find a
narrow middle direction - he de-literalizes biblical prophecy on the one hand
("PL" is clearly a story, a masque) and emphasizes history's chaotic
contingency (one damn thing after another) (especially toward the end of
PL) on the other.  But all the "famous" epics seem to take idiosyncratic
approaches toward history.  Sorry to keep harping on the oldies. - Old Hank

Absolutely! & also, "Descent of Alette." Would also remind of her piece "Epic
& Women Poets" in Waldman/Schelling's _Disembodied Poetics_, where she
discusses her sense of dream, narrative & search for measure.

"The story is allegorical, & allegory is one way in for women. As well as for
men who are tired of this century's lyric 'I,' or tired of fragmentation,
disjunction, literary theory, & hipness."

"The old twentieth century forms are now becoming too easy; continuity at
length is now hard. Continuity at length implies measure; by which I mean a
somewhat consistent unimpeded measure. A new content, a new consciousness,
implies the need for a new sound; form & measure are often the same."

"Stories, & measures, are dresses to slip into that give as you walk, at
least as much as any poem bound by, say, restrictions of language & demeanor,
whether the language of philosophical theory or some sort of plain speech, or
by line length or prose-seemingness or marked surface variation."

"A measure comes out of the individual& the culture at the same time: but you
the poet will perceive it to come out of your body, your head, the sounds
that play there; you will not be able to analyze it into being."

As I'm reading posts about "epic" I find myself coming back to a schpeel
Roland Barthes wrote somewhere (paraphrasing at work here) in _Critical
Essays__ about how the seemingly most direct and unencumbered way to suggest
compassion or grief to a friend who has suffered a loss is simply to write
"regret," that words beyond it tend to distract from primacy of the message
or even call the orginal intent of the message into question.  Epics strike
me, similarly, as a bunch of words about some great story that would be
better written in less (or no) words.  That the "epic" task of one who writes
the "epic" is in the audacity of overproducing the story, or, better, the
"truth" of the story.  This makes epic writing more attractive to me-- seeing
it as a way of ruining stories by writing way too much--suggesting that a
given text has too many words to be narrative.   Maybe this:  epic (v.)--to
be overeager about the way words look and sound in such a way as to ruin a
story that everyone seemingly aught to know by writing too many.

director; re-released a few years ago . . .; a highly stylized musical, a very
narrative movie] -- the opening sequence shows nothing but an abstracted
pattern of umbrellas crossing in the town square -- more "modern art"
than narrative at that point, but it plays with visual elements that are
soon to give way to the downpour of the tale . . .

I am feeling like an old bocce player now as I exclaim "But sure that's
narrative, _The Making of Americans_." There are characters, there is
development, aggh.

See, the thing is, there is no such thing as "Coolidge" or "Stein". To say
"Coolidge" or "Stein" is to ignore that these people did more than repeat
a dominant trope. Every time you think of them that way you're thinking of
a Big Mac, and every time you think of a Big Mac, you salivate (and/or
retch). The function of literature inasmuch as things people say write or
type can have functions is to remind people that although autonomic
response is an exciting option it is not one one is bound to. Omit your
independence to your cost.

Ah, see, you made me get soaked in romantic individualism again. Anyway
before the quarter in this coin-op John Godfrey-imitation wears out, let
me finish by reminding you that this is all closer to law than science,
that it's only argument bullying clarity and detail that go over here. No
work worth talking about is one thing, and no person can be spoken of with
respect as a simple unified person, with respect to the wild ongoing
cellular recordkeeping anyway.

thx for the corrective -- I had some subliminal doubt.  (My prob. w/
noting the narrativity in *Americans* stems from fact I wandered in *in
medias res* and didn't really "get" what were the characters, what was
the development; -- was more lost in the remarkable wash of the waves,
rather than noting that, yes, there's actually a beach here and some surfers
too.)

Speaking of beaches, an interesting angle on narrative is Leslie Scalapino's
*That They Were At The Beach* (for instance) . . .

this reminds that I've been meaning to read Carole Maso since monkey's
ears -- anyone care to recommend / critique particular volumes, in some
manner?

BTW, perhaps the "non-narrative" tag got some of its force from critical
writing re: performance art & dance & suchlike (some of which is/was,
some of which isn't/wasn't -- some very narrative; some avoiding "easy"
story reading) . . .

one can speak of a "simple" (or "single") narrative voice, vs. a multiple or
complex or . . . (well, it can be single but complex, as in [much of]
Scalapino) . . .

The ur-narratives are, of course, the myths.  And the appeal of narrative
seems allied w/ the appeal of mythology, no?

Sketches*, trans. by Nobayuki Yuasa, New York (1966) -- (that's the old
Penguin classic).  As for haiku, Robert Hass's recent trans. of 3 haiku
poets (including Basho) is darn good.

Regarding the Basho cited by Steven, that poem serves as epigraph to

     The *Phaedrus* is an exploration of the dynamics and dangers of
controlled time that make themselves accessible to readers, writers, and
lovers.  In Sokrates' view, a true *logos* has this in common with a real
love affair, that it must be lived out in time.  It is not the same backwards
as forwards, it cannot be entered at any point, or frozen at its acme, or
dismissed when fascination falters.  A reader, like a bad lover, may feel he
can zoom into his text at any point and pluck the fruit of its wisdom.  A
writer, like Lysias, may feel he can rearrange the limbs of the fiction on
which he dotes with no regard for its life as an organism in time.  So
readers and writers dabble in the glamor of *grammata* without
submitting themselves to wholesale erotic takeover or the change of self
entailed in it.  Like Odysseus bound to the mast of his ship, a reader may
titillate himself with the siren song of knowledge and sail past intact.  It
is a kind of voyeurism, as we see when we watch Phaedrus seduced by
the written words of Lysias.  In Plato's view, the Lysian text is as
philosophic pornography when compared with the erotic *logos* of
Sokrates.  But Plato cannot demonstrate this merely by aligning Lysias
and Sokrates as one dead text beside another.  The demonstration requires
something of a ruse if it is to be truly arresting.
     So Plato floats *logos* upon *logos*; they neither converge nor cancel
out.  We have seen other writers contrive such stereoscopic images.  For
example, Sappho in her fragment 31 superimposes one level of desire
upon another, floats the actual upon the possible, in such a way that our
perception jumps from one to the other without losing sight of the
difference between them.  Or again, the novelist Longus floats an apple
upon a tree plucked bare of fruit, defying logic and captivating Daphnis.
Or consider Zeno who, in his famous paradoxes, suspends moving
objects upon the impossibility of motion, so that we see Achilles running
as fast as he can, going nowhere.  These are writers who share a strategy;
they purpose to re-create in you a certain action of the mind and heart --
the action of reaching toward a meaning not yet known.  It is a reach that
never quite arrives, bittersweet.  Plato's interplay of *logoi* in the
*Phaedrus* imitates this reaching action.  As Phaedrus reads what Lysias
wrote, as Phaedrus listens to what Sokrates says, something begins to
come into focus.  You begin to understand what a *logos* is and what it
is not and the difference.  Like a face crossing a mirror at the back of the
room, Eros moves.  You reach.  Eros is gone.
     The *Phaedrus* is a written dialogue that ends by discrediting written
dialogues.  This fact does not cease to charm its readers.  Indeed, it is the
fundamental erotic feature of this *erotikos logos*.  Each time you read
it, you are conducted to a place where something paradoxical happens:
the knowledge of Eros that Sokrates and Phaedrus have been unfolding
word by word through the written text simply steps into a blind point
and vanishes, pulling the *logos* after it.  Their conversation about love
... turns into a conversation about writing ... and Eros is not seen or heard
from again.  This act of dialectical interception has, since antiquity,
perplexed those who wish to say concisely what the dialogue is about.
But there is nothing inappropriate here.  If you reach into the *Phaedrus*
to get hold of Eros, you will be eluded, necessarily.  He never looks at
you from the place from which you see him.  Something moves in the
space between.  That is the most erotic thing about Eros.

[pp. 165-167 -- pardon that this makes much reference to texts & terms
already summarized, excerpted &/or discussed earlier in the book; but
this shd. serve to give a taste of Carson's manner of thought & indeed
something of her thesis . . . ]

UPDATE ON FLOODED GRAND FORKS ARTS ORGANIZATIONS:

Less than .05% of residents have been allowed to move back into their homes
because of lack of water, sewer, gas & electric services.Most are 'camping
in' with friends, relatives or shelters both in and out of state.

We have confirmation that:

ND Ballet was burned out. All Records, equipment, etc. are gone, but they
were renters so can try to move to a new space, if/when one can be located.
They had to cancel performances and spring fundraisng efforts and are short
of current operating funds to use for the recovery period.

Firehall Community Theatre sustained substantial water damage and some fear
the building will be condemned...a determination to be made 'later' by the
powers that be.As of May 5, the degree of damage to equipment, costumes,
etc. could not be determined because the site could not be visited. They
had to cancel performances and spring fundraisng efforts and are short of
current operating funds to use for the recovery period.

North Valley Arts Council was temporarily housed in a commercial building
above water line and therefore still have their administrative hub, but
they were in a crucial stage of grant-seeking for renovation of an old
movie theatre as a mixed-purpose arts center. That building sustained
substantial water damage and no one seems to be able to forecast the
probable future of the project at this time.

Most of the remaining arts organizations (Symphony, ND Art Gallery, Master
Chorale, etc.) were housed above water-line (many on the UND Campus), but
operations have been severely interrupted and we will have to wait until
folks can move back home to find out how much damage has been done to
season ticket sales, fundraising, planning for next season etc.

******
At the request of Governor Schafer, the ND Community Fund is taking
donations for non-profit organizations for flood relief. Any donations can
be designated to a specific cause (such as 'the arts') or for a specific
organization. All donations are 100% tax deductible and 100% of the money
goes for flood relief. Contact information: North Dakota Community
Foundation, PO BOX 387, Bismarck, ND 58502-2191. Phone 1-800-605-5252.

******
The North Dakota Arts Alliance would like to publicly acknowledge
contributions to flood relief for the arts in order to underscore the
nationwide support for the belief that rebuilding the arts infrastructure
is vital to rebuilding a real community. Such documentation will also
provide moral support and generate tangible in-state support for the arts
organizations as they undergo the protracted recovery period. Please send
notification of flood-reief projects and/or contributions to: North Dakota
Arts Alliance PO BOX 428, Minot, ND 58702 or email to nodaa@minot.ndak.net
for publication.

*******
Individuals and organizations wishing to offer in-kind or replacement-goods
relief rather than money donations should contact North Dakota Arts
Alliance PO BOX 428, Minot, ND 58702, 701-839-1439, or email to
nodaa@minot.ndak.net so we can facilitate the matching of needs with
offered assistance.


Let's also give some deep thought to establishing an on-going national
disaster-relief fund for arts organizations facing unexpected disasters -
natural or un-natural.

Anyone interested in Stein ought to take a look at listmember Jennifer
Ashton's essay in the most recent ELH (#64)-- "Gertrude Stein for Anyone."

Besides being an incredibly interesting account of Stein's (changing)
thinking about the problem of "identity"--what makes a whole
thing whole and how do you represent it (problems thought through in a
number of contexts: literary, political, psychological, and mathematical)--
it is also entirely relevant to the questions being raised here:  is
Stein interested in "narrative" or not, is
there one "Stein project" or are there many.

Check it out.

Best,
O.

Thanks for clearing up where the Basho translation came from in _Eros.._
I figured it wasn't hers. I love that first line: "old pond" I imagine
water covered with duckweed, hence the plop instead of a splash.

BTW, I would recommend _Ava_ by Carole Maso in which several narratives
intertwine in the mind of a dying woman. On her last day of life, in fact.
The novel consists of short "paragraphs," usually one sentence, sometimes
more, sometimes fragments, often repetitive, so that the stories build
slowly but inexorably. Actually, "build" is a bit misleading. It's more
like they coalesce.

I would also recommend her outstanding essay in the Mar/Apr 1995 issue of
"American Poetry Review" in which she writes:

"Woolf in _The Common Reader_: Forget that 'appalling narrative business
of the realist: getting from lunch to dinner.'"

TTFN,

Sorry to beat this drum again: Milton and his contemporaries would have been
mightily surprised to hear that epic was already archaic. Within his
lifetime Davenant and Crowley wrote epics in English, and it was Dryden's
greatest (explicit) ambition, best realized in his pre-All for Love
tragedies and in his translation of Vergil. Nor were these guys alone. The
continent was humming with epic-making activity.

Erratum to the Erratum: Women of the Beat Generation

The Conari Press is attempting to maintain credibility within a larger
reading community by sending out an erratum stating that "an unfortunate
combination of computer glitches and copy editor confusion" is the cause
of Brenda Knight's re-copying of six paragraphs from my essay, "The
Reluctant Pixie Poole: A Recovery of Helen Adam." If this is true, I think
it is necessary to point to two paragraphs (not included in the six
mentioned above) where  Knight, in her attempt to disguise her reliance on
my text, unfortunately got the facts wrong. I am citing the two examples
below not necessarily as an attempt to demean the Conari
Press's erratum, but to clarify some of the erroneous scholarship in the
Helen Adam introduction to "Women of the Beat Generation"--scholarship to
which my name has (perhaps unfortunately) now been linked.

1.  Knight wrote: "In 1957, Helen started her own magical poetry and
performance troop called the Maidens that included Jess, Madeline Gleason,
Robert Duncan, Eve Triem, and James Broughton."
It is important to clarify that The Maidens were not a "performance troop
[troupe?]," and that it was not "started" by Helen Adam. The Maidens did
not perform and they were not a troupe--they were an erudite group of
artists who got together at each other's houses, dined and sipped coffee
while talking about Poetry (capital "P").
In the same paragraph she continues: "That same year, several important
events catapulted the Beats to fame, notably the publication of Jack
Kerouac's "On the Road" and the "Howl" obscenity trail. The Maidens were
intrigued by these new literary radicals, welcoming them at readings and
offering encouragement."
There is no evidence that The Maidens as a group were intrigued by the
Beats. The Maidens as a group were in fact antithetical to the Beats and
did not offer the Beats any encouragement. Their hermetic, domestic group
deliberately set themselves apart from the North Beach scene. However,
although the Maidens were critical of the Beats, Helen Adam herself was
not--and defended Allen Ginsberg's poetry in one of the workshops she
took. "apex of the M" #6 (forthcoming, Fall 1997), will have a section of
the Adam/Duncan correspondence in which Adam defends Ginsberg against
"suburban protesters." Anyone interested in The Maidens should read Kevin
Killian's excellent essay "Faggot Vomit: Jack Spicer and the Maidens" in
the most recent Poetry Project Newsletter.

2.  Knight wrote: "In 1964, Helen Adam received national attention when
her play "San Francisco's Burning" was staged off-Broadway in New York.
Sadly, a series of difficulties coincided with this success. Helen was
fired from her filing job of ten years and suffered from stress and
depression, leading to hospitalization and a series of shock treatments.
Helen and her sister, Pat, never parted, eventually moved to New York City
and lived in solitude until their deaths."

Knight totally mis-read my essay in coming up with a totally confused
paragraph, filled with factual and made-up errors: 1964 was the year that
Helen and Pat moved to New York--"San Francisco's Burning" was staged
off-off-(off) Broadway at the Judson Poet's Theater in 1968. (I had
written a singular "off" in my original essay, but this is incorrect.) The
play did not receive National attention, as Miss Knight inferred. Helen's
depression was in 1962, when "San Francisco's Burning" was first
staged--in San Francisco. Helen and Pat did not live in solitude until
their deaths. Pat perhaps--but Helen was quite a star in New York and had
lots of friends. I have recently received several letters from friends of
hers in New York who are somewhat annoyed with Knight's fabricated
statement!


Had I known that Knight was going to rely so heavily on my essay, I might
have warned her that I wrote the essay early in my work with the Adam
archive, and that the facts in the essay were not necessarily set in
stone. Unfortunately, as in the "off-Broadway" example, Knight repeated
another of my errors. I wrote (and soon after corrected, but apparently
not in the version I sent  Knight) that ". . . Helen Adam became the pride
of Scotland. The Elfin Pedlar was graced even by a note of praise from the
Queen of Scotland herself." Ooops! There hasn't been a Queen of Scotland
for centuries! Call it a mad-queen's revenge, but it is now published in
Knight's introduction that "Upon its publication, Helen Adam became the
pride of Scotland; The Elfin Pedlar even elicited a note of praise from
the queen of Scotland herself." Helen Adam in fact received a note from an
aristocratic acquaintance, who forwarded her a note of praise from the
Queen...of England.

The two clarifications are separate from my six paragraphs that were
"accidentally" used in Knight's introduction. Referring to those, I do not
necessarily think that a mass-market trade edition of a book should be
bogged down with footnotes and sentences beginning "According to..."
However, I do think a book with 30+ long introductions, that is being
marketed as "well researched," should have a list of sources credited at
the end. Most anthologies do this. Of course, I also think that Brenda
Knight would be better off admitting that for the Helen Adam section she
was in a bind: that the book was close to press-time, that she wanted to
include Helen Adam but had no information, that she called me (a graduate
student) for information, that I provided it, and that she unashamedly
used it. Because she strategically is refusing to do this, I cannot help
but think that other introductions in the book are plagued by the same
thievery, although certainly not on as large a scale. This is not to say
the "Women of the Beat Generation" was not researched. I do not dispute
that  Knight conducted hundreds of interviews to get her information for
the other sections. Therefore, I think that the only way for The Conari
Press to make amends with me (and maintain credibility with the larger
reading community) would be to have Brenda Knight go out and do research
herself for a new essay about Helen Adam for the second edition.

This post reflects more than my own personal anger--the Conari Press is a
small press, and this book will probably do quite well for them. (They are
marketing it with an audio cassette with Debra Winger reading some of the
poems!) Why couldn't it have been done right? It is an offense to the
responsibility and respectability of small presses, that it was not.

Those interested in Helen Adam can see my early essay at
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/prevallet/adam.html.
Or see my essay "A Sketch for a Helen Adam Biography" in the most recent
"First Intensity." I made an error in that essay however: Robert Duncan
died in 1986 and not in 1988 as I wrote.

Thanks again to Maria Damon for referring me to the National Writers
Union, who helped settle this case out of court.

Sincerely, Kristin Prevallet


ERRATUM
Due to an unfortunate combination of computer glitches and copy editor
confusion, portions of the biographical sketch of Helen Adam in the Conari
Press title "Women of the Beat Generation," that were drawn from the work
of
Kristin Prevallet, appeared without complete attribution. Ms. Prevallet
generously provided us with her excellent research on Helen Adam and we
apologize for any harm that might have occurred. Future printings will
restore the original accurate acknowledgments.

Thank You,

How does undermining trad. ideas of a genre constitute that genre? I

Narrative = the unfolding of meaning in (across) time

As Grenier himself has demonstrated (in more ways than one), even a single
vowel has a beginning, middle and end, events that can be modulated,
expectations set up and either satisfied, turned aside or turned up on their
heads (right side up)

The idea of a non-narrative art exists as an idea
but it never exists in the face of an actual text or sounded poem

David,

Your assertion, "If one enters...puzzle," goes a long way to clarify (and
perhaps even debunk) the rather too dichotomous genre/anti-genre approach.
Thanks. To push this along though--here's a bit from Lazer:

"Operating outside the universities and the official verse culture,
Language Writing has developed a character that makes reviewing it
problematic. Detailed readings of its devices and compositional modes might
well subordinate LW to the very habits of reading and thought it means to
resist." (Opposing Poetries, 1996)

This assertion confuses me somewhat, I confess--"its devices...modes"
implies that these things are known/knowable (reviewable?) quantities, but
"subordinate LW to the very habits..." implies that said devices and modes
are the same(?).

'time based' cf 'narrative'. music may or may not be narrative. (may or
may not be time based for that matter, but..) sculpture.. you get the
idea. as to the unfolding of a vowel and the (please!) avoidance of hegel,
i dare say your guess is as good as mine though what either knows of the
other does not necessarily include narrative. that would require a change
of mind.

Doesn't it mean to step up to a different plate, to enter a different
conversation, as far as the writing goes. And to locate poetry in a
very sepcific relation to the world. I hear you on the question of
creative imagination, but it seems to me the difference between, say,
Ark and Maximus is not about creative imagination but literally and
irreducibly about "history".

I don't think I'd agree that any of these are "totalizing gestures" (a
phrase that these days oozes with malediction). On the contrary, all
of them are defenetrating gestures. The problem is in how they come to
terms with history--Whitman overwhelmed by democratic possibility, Pound
overwhelmed by reactionary nostaligia for heroic culture, Olson--I
can't say about Olson right now, but the problem doesn't seem to be
"totalizing grand narratives." Again, it's got to do with the
specifics of the relation to history. So you're right in that avoiding
an articulation of a relation to history would get you around that
problem. And out of the conversation that preoccupies the
telling/doing/seeing (Dave Chirot's "site/sight/cite") we are calling
the epic.

It seems to me that once again we get caught in Ulro with our
simplistic dichotomy between "(totalizing) narrative = epic" vs.
"non-ordering intervention = (non-totalizing) non-narrative", where,
as those French guys teach, one side of this equation is good and the
other ain't so good (like individual/social, I/other etc.) It must be
handy to have it all laid out in such a neat, moral map, but isn't
what we're looking for a story? An(other) telling of our story? Isn't
part of our problem in finding a new relation to meaning as we
encounter it in history?

And having stepped right into the middle of that stinker, I'm going to
go change the baby.

Good to talk with you, Charles.

Best,
Mike

Is story then narrative made mimetic - that is an image (partial, distorted)
of recognizable reality (i.e. reality as a combination, a whole, living,
not an abstracted simple sound, etc. or discourse).

Imagine a world fully defined by the rules of geometry, in which all
entities are geometric entities.

Imagine within that world a space in the shape of a star. Imagine further
that we possess a mechanism which allows us to enlarge or reduce this
space, which may be a mental space (and the mechanism a mental mechanism),
without changing its geometry (its proportions if you will).

Now we take an object in hand.

Using our mechanism we may compare the object in hand and the
space-in-the-shape-of-a-star to determine whether the object will fit the
space in such a way that all the vectors determining the space's shape
touch at each point all the vectors determining the object's shape.

If so we would be in a position to say: "this object is a star" or more
modestly, "here is evidence that this object is a star -- it has the shape
of a star."

In so reduced a world it is possible categories of mind might work in the
way I describe. And in this way does the discussion of epic and narrative
on this list proceed.

Probably not, however, as an unstated assumption of a typological narrative
such as mine (above) is that there is an operator inside the world with
access to at least one dimension beyond the world being operated (e.g.
"take an object in hand", etc.).

A good place to start learning how categories actually work is _Women,
Fire, & Dangerous Things_ by George Lakoff.

...or as Alberto Caiero for F. Pessoa InterPersonal writes (more or less)
"The wind sings I am wind"  -- i.e. not "I am windiness."

Tom, look out, there's a comet approaching your left category from the north.
Don't let "it" slug you or bully you in any way.

I think the discussion of narrative & epic & poetry started in from a
scattered astronomical forte anomaly.  The engendering trope master
dictation squirrel envelope big bang involved the originary question:

is the issue of storytellying/narrative/drama/"action" (in Arrydistortle's
sense) interesting with respect to "poetry in the public sphere"?

& it's opened a field theoretical blurb knockabout kookaburra in several
directions.  but if you're tired we can go back to discussion
engineer fluid mechanisms in remote extracurricular control.

I'm a few days/weeksd/months behind on the list

...(and always reading from most recent to oldest, which somehow doesn't
improve one's sense of having conclusions to work from in moving toward
valid premises)...

Mike Boughn's mention of _From Feathers to Iron_ passes me by -- Mike,
which "Clarke" is the author, and can you say more about the book? (by
backchannel if it had been identified to the list and I mist).

plop! (damn a piece of scone fell into my cocoa)

Huh, I could have sworn I read a couple of references to "as far as I've
read in" one poem and other indications of asking whether X is Y when you
don't know X. Of course time is tight right now, epically tight.

(actually, that tastes good. all soft and kind of having lost any reference
to what intentions went into its making. it's as if the scone was a
modifier of the cocoa or as if it's all really cocoa, some is just also
scone or was)

If I mispell mispelling as mipselling, and claim its high intelligence,
only Ron Silliman on this list will read that as a joke and also see it as
a key to an epic narrative of our lives (hint: "mip" is an acronym).

(I bet I could market this? Not crisp enough? Hmmm, how to keep the scone
bits crisp in the cocoa...)

it's my understandng that duncan died in 1988.  i was on an mla panel on

Don't agree.  Someone's work can be, taken as a whole, fairly
representative of a given direction...I got ambushed because I know about
6 Coolidge books, a whole lot of writing, but not At Egypt, which everyone

I'm a bit behind, but play with these terms has certainly been going on in
Canadian criticism of various kinds of long poems up here. Actually,
Charles Berstein would still recall coming on to speak at The Long-Liners
conference back in 1984 right after Gary Geddes, a very trad poet, had held
forth on the desirability of getting out from under the influence of such
terrible poets s Pound (!) & back to storytelling. Charles's response, one
I have come to expect & enjoy since meeting him later, was "I'm pleased to
follow Gary Geddes because I can report to you that I disagreed with most
of what he said." And most of the papers at the conference took up other
modes of long poem than the 'simple' narrative.
But I want to point to  Canadian master of the long poem & its poetics,
Robert Kroetsch, whose ongoing poem is called Field Notes (_Completed Field
Notes_ Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1989). In an essay, "For Play and
Entrance: The Contemporary Canadian Long Poem" (in _The Lovely Treachery of
Words_ Toronto: Oxford UP, 1989 [these can be tracked down if you try]), he
says, specifically of bpNichol's _The Martyrology_: "In Nichol we have,
supremely, against the grammar of inherited story, the foregrounding of
language. But the limits of language are such (the spirit become flesh; The
Word become words) that all should be written down." And: "A method, then,
and then, and then, of composition; against the 'and then' of story. . . .
The story as fragment _becomes_ the long poem: the story becomes its own
narrative; i.e., our interest is in, not story, but the _act_ of telling
the story."

That's a beginning, of a way of looking at the reading of a lot of US long
poems too, how they pull us into the ongoing process of writing/reading,
or, perhaps, in response, reading/writing. And it has something to do with
the onrushing catching of one's interest in a series of 'sonnets' in Jack
Clarke's _In the Analogy_ (which I also recommend), as the accumulate the
narrative of their own coming to be, in order... Works, in its way, too,
for those parts of _Ark_ I have so far read.

agreed: though the continuity of Stein and Stein, from for example

thanks aldon.  been thinking about sappho in this context:

claim armymen; the rest hold up battleships
as the greatest show on earth. But I declaim.
It's who do you love.

It's no trouble to cinch this once and for all.
For she was Helena, beauty of the mortal
elsewhere, who left the man, the aristocrat,
behind.

And went floating off to Troy, with no
mind for offspring or beloved parents.
Love walked her sideways, knowing
straightway.

       puts me in mind of Anaktoria, now

I would rather see her step the lovely
and do the facial shine more than any
continental chariot decked with soldiers
under arms.

sometimes i think epic was over when this poem got written.  or virgil was a
dope for not realizing it.

Granted. I guess in my rush to defend the complications, I oversimplified.
This is not to cede the right to describe the vector and the complications
of that vector, though, which I see as really enmeshed (cough) with
narrative, or with story anyway. Narrative I hear more and more as a code
word for 'identity fiction'. A story, I sort of know what that is.
Something happened. To know what happened, though, you have to know this
other thing that happened before, and this longstanding idea the people
involved have of what is going to happen someday, and then you have to
know how all these people deal with each other. Coolidge goes through this
in most of the post-Solution Passage books I've seen, especially Mine,
Mesh, and During. True, it's harder to see how this kind of description of
Coolidge's work would apply to stuff like Space or The So.

And then there's the perpetual metanarrative of the poem talking to other
poems? the poem's own identity politics?

Blah blah but trying to say something anyway,
fuzzy Jordan

John High and Thoreau Lovell did a real final farewell reading together on
Wednesday, May 7th.  After hurriedly paying our tab for dinner at Blake's
(about which the less said the better) we hustled over to Cody's where
_Poetry Flash_ dude Richard Silburg introduced Thoreau, Thoreau having won
the coin toss.  Thoreau read mostly newer work, concentrating on a sequence
called "Amnesia's Diary", which he capped by forgetting the last line of
the last poem, which was "fools in all our forgetting".  The
appropriateness of such forgetting enhanced the easy spirit of the occasion
rather than making Thoreau look bad.  Some other lines of Thoreau's included:

ash to electronic exuberance
a prayerwheel of indestructible magazine poses
sound of water in the air
one old chromosome watching over the city
the clocks and the weather stopped talking to each other
smoking mountains stolen from the eyes of grazing horses

Thoreau also read "Pots and Pans", "Sharks", "Sex No Sex" and "Parts of It"

There was a short break and Richard introduced John, who read from the
Sasha Poems (mostly different than at his last two readings):

the fog lifting over Dogen's head, the sitting master weeping

 BACKGROUND: American Airlines is a major sponsor to and supporter of
groupslike GLADD, the Human Rights Campaign, the Gay and Lesbian
Victory Fund, the AIDS Action Foundation, DIFFA, AmFAR, and scores of
community-based groups representing gays and lesbians.  It is also the
first airline to adopt a written non-discrimination policy covering
sexual orientation in its employment practices.

 In an unusual joint letter was released to the media on Friday, March
14th from the Family Research Council, Concerned Women of America,
American Family Association and Coral Ridge Ministries. Radical right
leader Beverly LaHaye also went on Christian "talk radio" on Friday to
blast American Airlines because "American's sponsorship of homosexual
'pride' events constitutes an open endorsement of promiscuous
homosexuality."  She and the other groups have written Bob Crandall at
American to complain that the airline has  "gone beyond mere
tolerance" of  gays and lesbians.  The full article appeares in
Friday's Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and possibly picked up by other
newspapers around the country.  It has come to the attention of the
gay and Lesbian community that American Airline's switchboard and
e-mails are being bombarded now by homophobic and hateful callers who
have been urged by LaHaye and others to DEMAND the company terminate
its gay-friendly policies.

Henry, I'm not sure it's "THE" epic, but it does of course feature the
trip to the dead I spoke of a few days back -- not, apparently, from
the east of Greece, but from the north. Dodds' book _The Greeks and The
Irrational_ (still a great read) has a section on Orpheus that says the
myth came from Siberian shamanism -- the trip to Hades, then, was
originally the shaman's ability to bridge the two worlds, be in contact
with departed spirits. Orpheus was first a priest -- the lover and the
poet came a little later.

For you, and for anyone else still interested in the "old guys", a few
sections from my work-in-progress _Orpheus Retold_.


"a little too much in love
with his own music"

he'd gotten used to
the women's eyes closing,
their bodies swaying in trance,

thought no one could resist
those melodies, piercing
the bloodsteam, swifter

than any drug . . . so
challenged the death gods,
offered himself instead, "and

the bloodless ghosts, too,
were in tears." Triumphant,
he started back up,

but couldn't stop thinking about
the audience he'd just left,
command performance,

and looked back to see if
there were any more hangers-on . . .
someone should have told him:

you can't approach the dead
by looking for them. Soon
the critics got restless,

dissing him like a pop star
whose second album sells
less than the first. They wondered

if he'd lost it, that unique sound,
that voice . . . he took to the hills,
becoming "the first of Thrace

to prefer young boys"     they
never looked back


ORPHEUS SPEAKS

I don't trust these animals,
yellow eyes gleaming in the dark.
They'd just as soon rip me apart.

I don't know why I turned around --
I couldn't even see her face
in the dark. The villagers say

it was love, but Aphrodite
is not my god. She knows
I serve a different master:

order, harmony. What would happen
if I stopped playing? In the dark
they'd rip me apart.

The drunken sailors on the ship --
all they remembered were the birds.
Did they ever find that fleece?

I was watching the birds. Order,
harmony. The dead liked it too,
their shadows were dancing.

Drunken sailors. Animals.
Aphrodite is not my god.
I couldn't even see her face.

Hello all,

I'm a literature curator at New Langton Arts in San Francisco and I
am interested in having the organization put on some small productions
of plays which could be considered "poets' theatre". If you have a
script and might be interested in having me look at it, please send

        In response to/with Ron Silliman's noting Robert Grenier's work
in re narrative--(glad this was raised)--

        Grenier has an excellent book on narrative in the Curriculum of
the Soul series which John Clarke edited.
        It's called
                        ATTENTION:  SEVEN NARRATIVES

        Grenier's work, like Larry Eigner's, presents the movement of attention.
(And that movement opening out--from the page out in to the world--a poem
for Eigner being "like taking a walk"--and finding it extend--:
"serenditipty"--the movement of the poem being the narrative)

        In Grenier's work of the last ten years, the movement is in space
as well as in time.

        (Note:  recent work by Grenier, including a 45 pp. piece for
Larry Eiger--is up at Light and Dust Books.  Larry Eigner's Air the
Trees is also there

        http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm

        The "unfolding of meaning in (across) time" RS mentions is
spatialized--and literalized.  In Spring and All WCW wrote that he would
"invite" the reader to "read and see"--hence the emphasis on visual design
(from Demuth and Gris) in Williams' work--the verbal arrangment , the
american idiom, often being "dictated" by the visual structure.  (As a
kind of eidetic after image--WCW noting to Edith Heal that he reworked
"The Nightingales" for his first Collected--"see how much better it looks
on the page".)

        Grenier, who works a good deal with the early modernism of WCW and
Stein--notes that "langauge follows joyful seeing".

        Narrative in the work--"scrawl poems" as usually called--is
literally the seeing and reading of the work--following the lines, making
(or "making out" if one thinks of the activity as "deciphering")--making
the shapes of the letters and these making words--seeing moves into
"sounding"--sounding out the words--the work, the narrative that unfolds
meaning through time as RS has it--is spatialized--time "takes Place"--in
the horizontal overlays and overlaps, the moving in and out of each
other, of the words, often written "on top of" each other--one is seeing
the words in space as well as seeing and reading in time--

        this connection with seeing in space and time works with an
interrelationship like that of light--light is simultaneously particle
and wave--the "exact" position can not be "measured"--when moving among a
page of Grenier's writing--or "across" many of them--as they are meant to
be laid out in groupings--so one may read "across" or up and down--with
the lines and forms of each letter, each word, each page--being able to
be seen and read as particles--and as participating in a wave--

        "Narrative" then is not "only" movement "towards" a "meaning"--it
is literally the activity of the attention in the seeing and reading of
the letters/words "between shapes and sounds" (RG)--

        The movement of/with/in attention is the  narrative.  In seeing
and reading--I think Grenier is opening possibilites in a simulateneity
of Williams' "only the imagination is real" and "no ideas but in
things".  (The work does not "answer" this so much as, with all Grenier's
work--ask questions about "the actual as the gift of the possible".

        "That which exits through itself is what is called meaning" Olson
wrote--Grenier's work here as well opens many questions--

A plea to the list for information!
To the best of my knowledge there's no list available of all poetry secial
collections like the Archive at UCSD or Poet's House at U. of Arizona.
Obviously such a list would be useful to publishers like me and the poets
they publish. Please help me compile one (or inform me if one exists) by
front- or backchannelling info. If I get responses I will assemble and send
to the list.

(I think it was) from Lyn Hejinian & Carla Harriman [pardon re:

Dwayne,

Undermining traditional ideas of a genre re-constitutes that genre through
resistance  to the assumptions implicit in the genre, through resistance to
the ideas which govern or define the genre's identity, and this is done by
borrowing the terms of the genre and playfully (as in Ashbery's case)
standing them on their head even while acknowledging to some extent a degree
of fidelity to the original model - in _Flowchart's_ case, _The Prelude_.

How does undermining trad. ideas of a genre constitute that genre? I
suppose if one means by epic "very very large in scale," then that
statement would hold, Flowchart being large in the way we are not used to
seeing large. But if by epic we are talking about such elements as

poss. along those lines -- though (much) more generally: that which
precedes something else.  Presumably, the age of the epic is precursor to
other ages.  For since one cannot so easily hold everything, things must
continue to tumble forth  bit by bit, life by life, age by age; and thereby,
the era of the epic seems distant & dim -- hence its hold of (perhaps) a
nostalgic interest?

Er, well no, not exactly, Mark. I guess you caught me in flagrante
conflatio. But - having said that in an attempt to extricate myself from the
hole I've dug - I think a claim cld be put forward for _The Prelude_ as an
epic in autobiography, in which "the action," "the story,"  is the
development of the poet's consciousness. Which is also what I see happening
in _Flowchart_. This is admittedly a loose interp of "epic."

Having been absorbed lately in David Jones' _The Anathemata_, I'll toss out
a few peripheral scraps from my reading that may have some bearing here:

"I have made a heap of all that I could find." - Nennius (from DJ's intro)

"It was a dark and stormy night, we sat by the calcined wall; it was said to
the tale teller, tell us a tale, and the tale ran thus: it was a dark and
stormy night..." (epigraph).

Now this little diddy to my mind sums up what epic is all about - not just
that stuff about the "tale of the tribe" - but the rescuing of potentially
rejuvenating or at least still powerful  psychic material from the rimefrost
of cliche. Its circularity and self-referentialty are "the story" - i.e. the
history of the growth of consciousness, though maybe not too many here will
agree with that. _The Prelude_ cld be shoehorned into this model, and mebbe,
just  mebbe, _Flowchart_? All this begs the questions: is epic still
possible, or even desirable, and if so, what do we expect it to do?
Certainly not the affirmation of national/tribal identity as  _The Iliad_
did for the Greeks?

In a similar vein, I'd like to recommend Max Frisch's _Man in the
Holocence_, a short novel which is written from the point of view of a man
undergoing a stroke.  As his memory fails, he tapes up encyclopedia
cuttings, which appear in the book as gray texts.  Towards the end of the
book the gray texts completely wipe out everything else.  Very moving.

Temple University's Paley Library has something called the CCC,
Contemporary Culture Collection.  One of their focusses is small literary
journals of sixties and seventies and other rare pubs.  When i was doing a
paper on Blackburn,
i went their and paged through their copy of _The Omitted Journals_,  a
very limited edition
publication (Perishable Press?) of roughly twenty journal pieces that
didn't make it into his _The Journals_.  it was an attractive chapbook on
fine paper,  6"x12",  something like that.  i like the fact that they
forbid
pens in the small room.  you are allowed only to use a pencil if you want
to take notes.  something about the sacredness of paper.

don't have the address offhand,  but Temple does have a website.

*** apologies for cross-postings ***

I was *very* impressed by the video issue of this sparky, irreverent,
eclectic, London-based and superbly designed magazine (watch for the rising
star of the titles (and overall) designer, David Rainbird). Here is some
info recently sent out by the editor. Subscribe!

Date: Thu, 10 Apr 1997 21:11:52 +0100
From: rachel@engaged.demon.co.uk (Rachel Steward)
Subject: ENGAGED Issue 5

Dear Subscriber/Contributor,

I am writing to you with information about Issue 5 (now available), and to
illicit some feedback regarding the future of the magazine.

1. Issue 5 (published on video)

This is one of the most exciting issues yet, with eleven short films from a
talented group of film-makers and animators, some of whom are known talents
such as Jamie Thraves and Thomas Q Napper, recognised for their work on pop
promos for Radiohead,The Lightning Seeds, and Dodgy.

The Big Issue commented on Issue 5 - "a stylishly presented, 90-minute
programme, it features live action and animated films by 10 up-and-coming
young film-makers... In keeping with its informative, magazine-style brief,
you also get entertaining asides and interviews with the artists" (Big
Issue March 24-30).

Time Out thought it was "an exemplary issue" featuring "a diversity of
ambition and resources... but it's all provocative and engaging" and " all
wrapped up with highly professional graphics" (Time Out March 26-April 2).

Featured Films
Thomas Q Napper - Pineal Mouse
Seonaid Mackay & Vivienne Cherry - Book
Susannah Gent   - Black Bag
Andrew Kotting  - Jaunt
Sally Ann Arthur & Sean Topham- Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Peg Bar
Run Wrake - Juke box
Jamie Thraves - The Hackney Downs
Vito Rocco - Ciao Mamma... + Buona Fortuna
David Hopkinson - Taking Off
Francesca Iannaccone - Scrapbook

Guest Editor: Philip Ilson (Halloween Society)
Titles: David Rainbird
Sponsored and funded by: London Arts Board, London Film and Video
Development Agency and Halloween Society.

Price: ten pounds (UK),  thirteen pounds (Europe),  fifteen pounds (World)

Available: on subscription from the ENGAGED address (subscription form
attached) or from selected Arts bookshops.

Format: PAL, SECAM and NTSC
The video issue is packaged in a clear airbag.


2.  The Future

Before planning the next two years of ENGAGED, I am eager to get some
feed-back as to the
direction the magazine should be moving, both in terms of form and content.

QUESTIONS

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR FUTURE ISSUES?

WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGAGED TAKING ON ADVERTISING?

WOULD YOU LIKE THE MAGAZINE TO HAVE MORE EDITORIAL AND/OR ARTISTS' CONTENT?

DO YOU HAVE A LOCAL OUTLET THAT YOU FEEL SHOULD STOCK ENGAGED?

If you have any answers then please phone or
e-mail me 0171 7363123 - <rachel@engaged.demon.co.uk>.


FUTURE ISSUES ALREADY UNDERWAY:
ISSUE 6 - the radio issue - planned for early summer
This will be a flexible package of poetry, story-telling, music, and
sound-art. I aim to get it broadcast on as many stations as possible from
the main-stream to the smallest pirate stations both in the UK, Europe,
Australia, USA, Canada... It will also be available on the internet with
real audio.

For those of you who have already submitted work, many thanks, sorry about
the delay, but I will be in touch as soon as the issue takes shape.
Submissions are still being accepted, SAE for return.

ISSUE 7 - the comic/cartoon issue. Please send photocopies at this stage.
ISSUE 8 - an internet issue. I hope to have a web page up in the near
future so as to start getting ideas as to how this particular issue could
work. Any suggestion welcomed, and keep your eyes open for the web page in
the next month.

VACANCIES -
A Guest Editor is required for the Radio Issue. Ideally, someone with a
good knowledge of the medium.
A Part-time Volunteer to help with the magazine in general. Some experience
of publicity and fundraising would be useful.

I look forward to hearing from you with regard to any of the above, and if
you choose to sample the delights of ENGAGED # 5, then I hope you enjoy the
experience.

Yours sincerely,

Rachel Steward
Editor

        Last week, Peter Stallybrass gave a talk entitled "Hands &
Books: a materialist phenomenology of reading and writing" as part of
his "The History of the Book" lecture series at UPenn.  His focus on
the materiality of the book is one that I believe speaks to the interest
of many this listserv subscribers.  So:
        He began by speaking of the history of the codex - as opposed
to the scroll - as being that of the history of bookmarks.  Within this
technological history is also the history of the hand in relation to the
book, especially the relationship of the index in all its multiple senses.
Stallybrass said that the transition from scroll to codex was a
technological one that begat a _discontinuous_ reading strategy, rather
than a _continuous_ one.  For example, scrolls need to be held by both
hands, whereas a lectern allows a reader to perform other activities
(such as taking notes, etc.) while reading.  Scrolls, requiring both
hands, also require a very full physical participation.  Scrolls also, for
the most part, require continuous reading from beginning to end
whereas a book (at least once read) can be marked and returned to.
The physical proximity of reading event in a scroll is challenged by
the ease with which one can move back and forth within a codex.
        Stallybrass says that "Christianity _cut up_ the Judaic scroll
by means of the codex."  (In the Christian Bible vs the Judaic Scroll,
for example:  "The story of the sacrifice of Isaac would thus be read
less in terms of its proximate narratives in Genesis than as a
prefiguration of the "son's" crucifixion."  The Old Testament is thus
"fulfilled" in the New Testament.)  One of the most persistent uses of
the book as a _machine_, says Stallybrass, is the emphasis on
discontinuous historical and theological moments that the codex
encourages.
        His talk centred around various religious paintings from
Caravaggio to Rembrandt.  In these, Stallybrass showed (through
photocopies and slides) how paintings before the Cartesian moment
displayed various versions of scholar/scribe painted with various
lecterns, weights, fingers or ribbons marking pages, and using other
"tools" to read/write.  The materiality of the text was ever present in
these depictions as the subject (St. Jerome, St. John, the Virgin Mary,
etc.) holds scrolls, books, ink, and pens, listens to God or the Holy
Spirit (often in the form of either a dove or a scroll from above), and is
always shown marking _at least_ one other page than the one to which
the book is opened.
        One of the modern myths of reading, says Stallybrass, is that
of teleological narrative; that is, that "the book" is to be read from
page 1 to page 2, and so on.  Indeed, this strategy of reading was
encouraged by the development of narrative fiction in the 18th
Century.  Interestingly, Stallybrass suggests that after the Cartesian
moment, images of the materiality of writing in the paintings, are
effaced.  There is no longer evidence of discontinuous reading; the
finger as index drops away.  The materiality become less important as
emphasis in writing shifts to the _mind_ rather than the body.

Interesting. So Christians, by cutting up the old scroll and binding it in a
book changed the reading habits of the one or two percent of the population
that knew how to read pre-Gutenberg. Those masters at discontinuous reading,
the Talmudic rabbis, must have had a miraculous dispensation.
What does he make of clay tablets or inscriptions on walls? Maybe in the
case of the latter the invention of the two-way street created a paradigm
shift.
God, I love ingenious hypotheses, especially if they're undemonstrable.

_From Feathers to Iron, A Concourse of World Poetics_ is the
"transcription" of a series of four lectures John Clarke presented at
New College in 1980, augmented with opious notes, including Jack's
sonnets. The book was published by Tomboctou/Convivio in 1986. It's a
wild, undescribable, brilliant trek through an historical grammar of
poetic myth. Like nothing you've read before.

John Clarke was a friend and student of Charles Olson in Buffalo.
Co-founder of the Institute of Further Studies, general editor of the
Curriculum of the Soul, and editor during the last years of his life
of _intent.: letter of talk, thinking and document_.

I think Steve Dickison may still have some Feathers. Shuffaloff books
definitely does if anyone is interested ($14.00US). Clarke's last
poems, _In the Anlogy, Books 1-7_, which move to realize the complex
poetics of Feathers, were published by shuffaloff in February.

Did anyone attending PPS make it to the panels "Community and the Place of
Poetry" (Ted Pearson, Ross Talarico, and ML Liebler), "Feminist Avant-Garde"
(Cynthia Hogue, Elisabeth Frost, and Brian McHale), or "Close Encounters:
Thinking About Distribution" (Loss Glazier, Natalie Gerber, Patricia Willis)?
I would appreciate hearing about the discussions in those panels, if anyone has
the time and energy to report.

I did get away from the registration desk on Sunday morning, for Burton
Hatlen's talk on "Neo-Objectivism."  He outlined what seemed to me a very
ambitious project--a new rubric for a group of poets in dialogue with Language
poets but engaged (as an ethical demand) with particulars of experience, with a
"real," sensual, & apprehensible world.  The three poets he spoke of as
exemplars of Neo-Objectivism were (all present at the conference) Michael
Heller, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, and Armand Schwerner.  Schwerner, by the way,
gave a terrific reading Saturday night (as did Irena Klepfisz) that delighted
the large, diverse audience, especially the hard-to-please New Jersey bar-poet
crowd.  This "After Hours" event was one of the highlights of the conference
for me,  although most of the professors had gone to bed by then.  When the
building closed down hours later, the poets (many students) took their work out
on the street & performed impressive, politically engaged work.

I would also like to hear news of the "Diversity in Avant-Garde Publishing
Panel" ...

The quote below's elequent and interesting and makes the point I've tried
hesitently to make before (tho' it doesn't intend to)--a point no one else
on the list agrees with...To wit, use of the academic term, epic, is
inappropriate and useless and boring, for us, writing this many decades
after so many stultified molds got swept to one side...I mean, the
rescuing of potentially rejuvinating psychic material from the rimefrost
of cliche, is the most worthy task I can think of,,,,,And what the hell
has it got to do with epic specifically...Sounds to me like a definition
of the poet's task, period..

Grovelling apologies. I'm sure that all 500+ of you were just desperate to
know that I was setting poetics to nomail. But as my old pal Aldon kindly
pointed out, one doesn't accomplish that (the setting) by sending the message
to the Poetics list.

So having taken up your e-space with one "empty" message, I thought I'd just

The question of the Prelude-as-epic might also need to take up WW's various
uses of Paradise Lose.  WW al-ludes to it all over the place, and at times
seems to want to think of himself as Satan.  Perhaps for WW, epic = sublime
desire for an irrevocable position from which to claim the legitimacy of
self-creation = failure and free-falling.  WW outdoes Satan by dispensing
with plotting (of narratives of compensation) and instead playing with the
fleeting but always renewable feeling of illegitimacy.  (Different time as
a result.)

The autobiographical epic is a giant serpentine water-slide which one can
descend over and over again in order to make a splash in the pool of bathos.

I sympathize with Daniel Tessitore about the ads though I like them
myself.  To make them less intrusive, would it be possible to keep them
aside, then put into one posting once a week for the listing?  I'm still
a novice at internetting so have no idea how much work this would be.
Or maybe someone could volunteer (not me, alas) to collect all the ads
for a month backchannel, and put them together weekly (or daily, or
whatever) for the rest of us.  Eventually perhaps an ad-mail-off option
might be possible?  That is, those not wishing to see the ads would not
be sent them.  Seems to me something could be done.   --Bob G

soliciting information on the poetry-related books, magazines,

are editing, coordinating, curating, or advocating. This is one of the
fundamental purposes of the Poetics List and fully as important to our
mutual exchanges as conversation about poetry. After a while, I hope you
will see this as integral to the activity. From the first, it has seemed
to those of us coordinating Poetics that the Intenet and this list in
particular were ideally situated for exchange of often
difficult-to-obtain poetry listings. There is no "other" space for this
activity, and beyond that I actually find the listings posted here of
great interest.

Would hate to see the announcements (as I think of them) discouraged in
any way--it's great to know what people are up to and as Bill Luoma once
said or implied (correct me if I'm wrong, Bill) they are refreshingly
straightforward public relations, unlike the more prevalent and more
tortured sort.

I know that when I came to the East Coast, the announcements here were
very helpful in allowing me to plan what I wanted to do in New York...I
am glad to see them here.

Very interesting conversation you've started here, and I entirely
disagree with you. What else did you not want to talk about?On Mon, 12 May

I agree with Rachel and Nick on this: one can hardly consider these
announcements spamming! If anything, we should rejoice that what the
community which keeps this list vital discusses bears some fruit beyond
the (sorry) occasionally abstruse but (honest) usually fascinating and
incisive perorations anent form/content, the social(?) construction of
the 'individual,' etc. If anything deserves reconsideration, I'd exempt
announcements of production and raise an eyebrow at the incrowd needling
palaver between chums--but hey, I enjoy that, too! Remember Allen?
        More announcements! More angelic chatter!
        More dustclouds of poetic arcana a la the recent gossip session
                celebrations at St. Mark's 30th anniversary celebration!
        More Martian Spiceresque graffiti!
        Sarabands of sarcasm! Plethoras of product promotions profiting
        whom? Inky Charles at Chax? Billionaire Boughn at shuffaloff?
        Kick ass! Take names! Expose the imperialist warmongers!
        Jesus! (What was that address? What price postage? Can I get
                a discount if I send a poem?

No blame.
Aloha.
Shantih.

Just to add that the 'cutting-up' of the scrolls, if indeed a
shift to discontinuous reading (and most folk were hearing their
scrolls and early books) pertains only to a particular European tradition.
Mayans, for example, would appear to have went right from stone material
to a form of so-called CODEX (though it folds outwards, is not bound along
one edge).  Keith Smith's _Text in Book Format_ gives a good run-down
on codex, oriental fold, venetian blind, and fan format books.

As with work like Jack Goody's--which contends that the 'list' marks a
shift towards literacy and consequent development of the analytic
mind--such culturally global theories are usually pretty dicey, if also
fascinating.

Recall, also, that early European manuscripts didn't divide language into
sentences andactuallyranallthewordstogetherwithoutobservingboundariestalk

Ah! I seem to have sent theis message twice--sorry! Just before I clicked
onj Send, I got a Divide by Zero message cascade & had to log off, so I
thought the message killed. [A caveat, I guess, to wait a while if this
happens, to see whether the message comes back--but I wanted to get to
bed...].

top to bottom of line, right to left of page) -- but most books of poetry

some fore-notes or after-notes, too . . .  --

late-night on that curious cable TV channel that's given over to classical
music (usually -- typically music videos of Beethovan, et alia), and
occasionally some dance or other art stuff, -- day or two ago, I caught a
program of David Hockney expounding on some Chinese handscroll
paintings -- alas, the exposition was too brief, but what scrolls they
were! -- one depicting the visit of the Emperor to a certain region, sailing
his barge down the River -- & the length of the scroll showed all the little
houses (etc.), w/ folk preparing for the august event . . . Hockney gave
some nice sense of the handscroll form & it's special modes of continuity

On the same side of the world I can only agree - and add that I've bought
books advertised on the Poetics list and tapes listed via Laura Moriarty as
well....
I doubt that I'd have found some of these things had I never subscribed to
Poetics...and I was relieved to see Charles Bernstein's post reminding

 The matrical fissure of schizophrenia, as opposed to paranoiac
castration; and the line of escape as opposed to the "blue line," the
blues.

        O mother
        farewell
        with a long black shoe
        farewell
        with Communist party and a broken stocking....
        with your sagging belly
        with your fear of Hitler
        with your mouth of bad short stories....
        with your belly of strikes and smokestacks
        with your chin of Trotsky and the Spanish war
        with your voice singing for the decaying overbroken workers....

        with your eyes
        with your eyes of Russia
        with your eyes of no money....
        with your eyes of starving India....
        with your eyes of Czechoslovakia attacked by robots....
        with your eyes being led away by policemen to an ambulance
        with your eyes with the pancreas removed
        with your eyes of appendix operation
        with your eyes of abortion
        with your eyes of ovaries removed
        with your eyes of shock
        with your eyes of lobotomy
        with your eyes of divorce....

        Why these words, paranoia and schizophrenia, which are like
talking birds and girls' first names? Why do social investments follow
this dividing line that gives them a specifically delirous content
(recreating history in delirium)?

                When I write about an author... think of the author you
are writing about. Think of her so  hard that she can no longer be an
object, and equally so that you cannot identify with her....Give back to
the author a little of the joy, the energy, the life of love and politics
that she knew how to give and invent. SO many dead writers must have wept
over what has been written about them. I hope that Ginsberg will be
pleased over the book that we did on him, and its for the reason the book
pleased nobody...Avoid the double shame of the scholar and the
familiar....
        The superiority of Anglo American Literature
To leave, to escape, is to trace a line.... To leave to escape to
leave.... to cross the horizon, enter into another life....It is thus that
Ginsberg really finds himself in the middle of the Indian continent. He
has really crossed the meridian, crossed the line of the horizon.... One
only discovers worlds though a long, broken flight. It is the opposite of
the imaginary Anglo American literature constantly shows these
ruptures,these characters who create their line of flight, whoc reate
through a line of flight.... HArdy, Melville, Stevenson , Woolf, Thomas
Woolf, LAwrence, Fitzgerald, Kerouac. In them everything is a departure,
becoming,
                passage,

                                Leap
        daemon,
                a relationship with the outside (I repeat G.[insberg]
is a man of the real. By which I mean a man of the future real....No more
mirage of the imaginary burdened with identifications, phantasies or
anything of the kind). This fixed point for him was, for him, perhaps
named
love.... They create a new Earth... American literature operates according
to geographical lines: the flight towards the West,the discovery that the
true East is in the West, the sense of frontiers as something to cross, to
push back, to go beyond.
        The author creates a world, but there is no world which awaits us
to be created....One must on the contrary speak with, write with.


        O  mother what have I left out
        O mother what have I forgotten

        with your Death full of Flowers

        No More to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the
        Dream, trapped in its disappearance


        Love's multitudinous boneyard
                of decay,
        The spilled milk of heroes

Becoming is loving without alcohol, drugs and madness, becoming sober for
a life which is richer and richer. This is sympathy, assembling. Making
one's bed, the opposite of making a career....

        Destruction of silk kerchiefs
                by dust storm,
        Caress of heroes blindfolded to posts

We know of no book of love more important, more insinuating than Kerouac's
Subterraneans....

                The void that's highly embraceable
                        during sleep
                Has no location and no fret;
                Yet I keep restless mental searching
                And geographical meandering
                To find the Holy Inside Milk
                Demema gave to all.


        In reality writing does not have an end in itself, precisely
because life is not something personal....

        The line of flight in these creative beings is creative of these
becomings...

        The wheel of the quivering meat conception
        Turns in the void expelling human beings,
        Pigs, turtles, frogs, insects, nits,
        Mice, lice, lizards, rats, roan
        RAcing horses, poxy bucolic pigtics,
        Horrible unnameable lice of vultures,
        Muderous attacking dog armies
        Of Africa, Rhinos roaming in the jungle,
        VAst boars and huge gigantic bull
        Elephants, rams, eagles, condors,
        Pones and Porcupines and Pills -
        All the endless conception of living beings
        Gnashing everywhere in Consciousness
        throughout the ten directions of space
        occupying all the quarters in & out,
        From supermicroscopic no-bug
        To huge Galaxy Lightyear Bowell
        Illuminating the sky of one Mind -
                Poor! I wish I was free
                of that slaving meat wheel
                and safe in heaven dead


  Kerouac's phrases are as sober as a Japanese drawing, a pure line
traced by an unsupported hand, which passes across ages and reigns. It
would take a true alcoholic to attain that degree of sobriety....

  Strange Anglo-American literature: from Thomas Hardy,from D.H. LAwrence
to Malcolm  Lowry, from Henry Miller to Allen Ginsberg and JAck Kerouac,
men who know how to leave, to scramble the codes, to cause flows to
circulate, to traverse the desert of the body without organs....How an
author is great because he cannot prevent himself from  tracing flows and
causing them to circulate.... a syntatical, agrammatical; less by what
makes it a signifying thing, but by what causes it to move, to flow, to
explode - desire. For literature is like schizophrenia: a process and not
a goal, a production and not an expression.

I agree with Rachel 10,000%.....I would be hard-pressed to name all the
great recent publications I heard about thru the list....I have some
sympathy with folks feeling flooded by stuff that isn't their number one
priority.  Sometimes I feel overburdened by others' personal chat
and repartee....But I think a hair-trigger delete button is the main
answer.  Many of us, and myself first among 'em, feel that keeping in
touch thru each others' poetry publications is one of the most difficult
aspects of the poetry world right now...The worst are filled with grants
and u.p. book contracts, while the best are scuffling around
D.I.Y....(that was an atrocious attempt at a yeats travesty--but you get
the idea)...I would feel cut off from a VITAL resource if there was less
announcement of publications on the list!!! I feel that characterizing 'em
as advertisements is a little weird too, given the personal financial
sacrifice many of these folks go thru to get this stuff out..(I mean, the
word is technically correct, but the overtones are wrong).

Rachel,  Yes I think i said that.  and by "the more prevalent and tortured
sort", i think you mean all poetics things are ads and pr puff pieces anyway.
. . .

so why not include the more obvious sort?

Best not to forget that The Prelude wasn't meant as a self-contained
work. It was to be set alongside The Excursion and the other poems of
the uncompleted series The Recluse.  In fact, Wordsworth intimates that
he wanted all his work to be taken as a single poetic opus (making for
some interesting parallels with Whitman, and with a number of poets
influenced by Black Mountain.

From the Preface to the Excursion:

. . . the two Works [Prelude and Excursion] have the same relation to
each other . . . as the ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic church.
Continuing this allusion . . . minor Pieces, which have been long before
the Public, when they shall be properly arranged, will be found by the
attentive Reader to have such a connection with the main Work as may
give them claim to be likened to little cells, oratories, and sepulchral
recesses, ordinarily included in those edifices.

What cable TV channel is this? Is it available nationally? Or is it just

I vote with Rachel & the gang, I like the notices, they're a big help -
but this ain't a good argument for keeping them.  If our talk is just
pr & puff, why not ONLY do the ads?  Sorry, Bill, but I intend to keep
huffing and puffing with all four of my pseudonyms.  Stay tuned for
the latest aesthetic advances.

I've been meaning to mention for a while now a fact that seems to me to
be quite significant--I've arrived at a point where my reading Wish List
is made up in large part not just of books mentioned by people on this
list--the various recommendations and passing mentions that are often so
interesting--but of books actually written by list members--there seems
to have been an especially compelling flurry of appearances of late.

I also like to read the announcements of events even when I know I won't
possibly be able to attend--they often arouse in me a stimulating mix
of curiosity, envy, regret, and vicarious thrill, as well as generating
a buzzing awareness of the Dispersed & Thriving Life of Poetry--like
listening to "the news" the way i'd like it to be reported.  Also, as
someone else mentioned, there's always the chance of a trip leading
to a salutary co/incidence.  steve

On Friday, May 9, 1996, San Francisco's (and the world's) Small Press
Traffic ended its schedule (at least until August) with a reading by
Douglas Powell and Jessica Grim.  I brought my friend Jenny Osgood, whom
I've known since high school and who was visiting from San Diego.  It was
her first poetry reading.  She said she enjoyed it, so perhaps it won't be
the last.

We did arrive after Douglas had started due to a late dinner,
unfortunately.  Having to stand prevented me from writing down any of the
fine lines he read, many from his MS that is scheduled to be published by
Wesleyan Press if memory serves.  I can tell you that Doug read each word
very carefully and that his work is clever, funny, touching and
occasionally heart-rending.

At the break we grabbed seats in the back and read the new Mirage.  The
Jessica Grim's turn came.  She announced her intention to read work so new
none of the titles were final yet, and plunged right in:

it belates us   what thinking predicts
it is a tunnel to the home in their head
it rose up and fanned the sorry cows
hoarding the betweenness
tapered to the finest presence, albeit steeply
stone calamity abbreviates the face
cultivation accretes below the waterline
fecund pundit moon
prone dervishes' edict

and then she read a funny found piece made of words entered by students
doing searches of a library database, words that turned up zero records.

Jessica started her reading by informing Doug that her skirt was blue,
evidently referring to something that happened before I made it.  Maybe one
of the following people who were in the audience that night can explain:

Ed Mycue, Spencer Selby, Lyn Hejinian, Lauren Hudath, Pam Lu, Kevin
Killian, Dodie Bellamy, Leslie Scalapino, Jean Day, Laura Moriarty, David
Bromige, Carol Ciavonne, Travis Ortiz, Cydney Chadwick, Giovanni Singleton,
Renee Gladman, Brian Lucas, Hung Tu, Steve Dickison, Tina Rotenberg, Pat
Reed, Margie Sloan, Nick Karavatos, Sam, anyone?

The "Santa Rosa contingent" (loosely composed of David, Doug, Sam, Carol,
Cyd, and Margie) invited us to Timo's for _tapas_ afterward, and though it
was hard to calm down in a place with such a buzz, the _flan de naranja_
was sweet and tasty.  Everyone congratulated Jenny on NOT being a writer.

Be that as it may, tonight at Intersection for the Arts on Valencia between
15th and 16th sees the return of former San Franciscan and current
Brooklynite Drew Gardner.  8:00!

So how come the Poetics archive at the EPC now starts in April 1994?  One
used to be able to go back at least to Peter's post.  Did these early
"national" posts get lost in the move to a new server or what?

Thanks for the review, Steve--BUT--Small Press Traffic has one more event
in May--a book party/ reading for the second issue of Clamour.

=46riday, May 16, 7:30 p.m.
Clamour

a reading by contributors

Tisa Bryant
Aja Couchois Duncan
Terry A. Miller
Elissa Perry

According to editor Renee Gladman, =B3---------=B2  _Clamour_ #1 exploded al=
l
our preconceptions of what modern experimental poetry can be and do, can
mean and say and perform ... within sexuality, a longing, an absence ...
within racial identity a deconstruction of the self, of the =B3other=B2 ...
within critical inquiry an activism that soars and shouts ... the garment
of ethnicity rent, torn and repatched.  An essential magazine.  _Clamour_
#2 will be released at this event.

New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street
$5

Re:  the "------------" above, I'm at home and only have the first draft of
the flyer copy at my disposal.  On the flyer Renee is quoted as saying
something about how Clamour is a place where "dykes" can experiment and
communicate with one another.  Though, of course, she's more elegant than
my paraphrase.

Subject:      the notion of voice
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        There is an idea often floated around that the rise of the
contemporary "workshop" poem is related to a particular concept of poetic
"voice"--in general, that "voice" is an individual matter that a writer
finds with practice and time. To a greater or lesser extent, this "voice"
is the natural property of the writer in the language--it is his or her
"own" voice, albeit one discovered rather than given. Whether anyone
actually believes this, or has said so in so many words, is something I'm
trying to find out.

        Is anyone aware of published articles or books that
articulate/elaborate/defend this notion of voice, or something similar to
it--obviously, my description above is meant to be very general. I would
appreciate backchannels with any specific information. I suppose as a list
matter it might also be a subject for discussion, but someone could be of
most help to me if they have specific information about sources.

        Thanks in advance for any help.

        Mark Wallace

I too appreciate the announcements and reports of readings, but (and I
apologize, Steve Carll, because this is going to sound churlish) I find
myself frustrated with your otherwise voluminous SF "reviews" by your
practice of quoting individual lines out of context. Narrative,
meta-narrative, and IBM Deep Blue aside, I find myself totally bewildered
about what even one individual poem could actually have said, or sounded
like: perhaps you could ASK the poet in question for a copy of his or her
poem that you liked a lot and then post that to the list?

If this is just my envy at no longer living in the Bay Area and so not
having a chance to actually attend these events myself, I apologize.

Joe --

I dunno. I think Steve's practice of reporting the lines that he thinks
were exemplary is a fair representation of one kind of poetry audience
experience. That is, you don't get a holograph of a poem at a reading. If
he were to give you the whole poem in his report, it'd get to be a bit too
much like Borges' map of the country at a one-to-one scale. Maybe I'm just
going through tv sports news withdrawal, but the 'highlights' version of
the event doesn't bug me.

Incidentally, I think Steve's set to nomail.

Actually, I'd very much like to see some discussion of this subject.  I've
been sympathetic to the Langpo-and-after critique of the fetishizing of
such a voice, a critique which correlates pretty closely, i guess w/
the post-structuralist attack on the notion of the "unified subject."
At the same time, tho, i've always felt that this issue is complex.  Lots
of poets I admire *do* seem to have a particular and identifiable "voice."
This is true of poets, like Oppen, still devoted to "lyric valuables."
But it cld it also be true even of a poet like Bernstein who wants to
deconstruct the traditional lyric, often violently collaging disparate
materials to this end?  One still hears, at least sometimes, something
like a "voice" emerging from the pile-up.  Or at least discovers, and
learns to
recognize, characteristic patternings and maneuvers.  Is there any reason
to think of such patterning as a "voice," or is this just a holdover
from older modes, a readerly bad habit?  Certainly, if one hears Charles
B. read his poetry he *does* have a "voice," and a quite unmistakble one
at that.

When I interviewed Carl Rakosi he called himself a "poet of voice, of
voices."  That little stutter has always intrigued me--acknowledging
multiplicity but keeping, in some form, the concept of poetic voice.
Heck, I've been told I have one myself, but if so i didn't pick it up
in a workshop.  steve

Steve Carll's not responsible for the "quotable-line" genre which is
prevalent in these reading reports from various reporters.  Quotable-Line
Poetry is an offshoot of the New Joke School which stems from Wordsworth's
NW Rear Cathedral Dispensary Chapel Exit poem, titled "Hyper Burbling Brook".

Mark:

Regarding your post on the origin of "voice" as American poetry episteme or
belief system. I seem to recall an article in Poets and Writers from two
years back that touched on this idea. I can't remember the author, but it
was a polemic against the workshop/MFA factory.

His most damning evidence was random quotations from "best poetry"
anthologies of that year, pieces that all more-or-less began with a
childhood reminiscence or the death of a family member -- ergo workshop/MFA
poets are programmed to cover only certain topics, also (and this is where
his argument was hopelessly flawed) that they lack the experience to write
about anything else because all they do is sponge off the workshop/MFA
circuit (too adroit, really). He should have questioned it at the level you
are contemplating. Regardless of his agenda, I think the notion of "voice"
you are examining is linked to what he's talking about. Also, I would think
that the definition of "experience" is key here, as well. I'll try to dig up
the piece and I'll let you know if I find it.

Subject:      Re: the notion of voice

footnote:

don't know (this evening) where one wd locate the manner of locus
classicus [or anyway, good exampli] of the "unique voice" idea that Mark
W. seeks, surely many such cites (at least in secondaryish sources) must
be floating around far & wide & rampant --

but I've a suggestion abt. this: if one limits the voice idea to poetry per se
(rather than, more broadly, looking at the notion as applied to "writing"),
one circumscribes it somewhat unnaturally, meseems --

one particularly runs across phrases like "then he found his voice" in
biographies of prose writers of, say, early 20th century American fiction
-- doesn't one?  Such is integral to widespread mythologies of "the
modern [fiction] writer," seems --

I'd hazard a guess the idea may've developed some of its force in such
environments rather than strictly within metes & bounds of the
line-brreak crowd --

d.i.

p.s.:

of course, speaking of "voice" as a term suggesting a consistent or
discernable (sometimes evolving) personal style, arguably this goes back
far in many poetry traditions -- even though the relation between the
individual voice & the collective voice seems (as usual) hard to scrutinize
& dissect -- rather ebb-&-flow-ish --

but in (for instance) Chinese poetry, the idea is typically considered
present & evident as far back as Chu Yuan (circa 2nd century BC?),
who's generally considered the 1st now-known Chinese poet to have
demonstrated an individual voice (quite different -- in some of his work --
from the corpus of "Book of Songs" poems, which are awash in what one
could certainly call "the collective voice" -- as is folk utterance generally)
-- & the notion of voice (or closely-kindred ideas, admittedly not using
that specific term) seem esp. strong in Tao Yuan-ming [4th century or so
AD?] and then, in basically the whole growing tradition thereafter -- esp.
the Tang & Song dynasty poets (taking us thru 13th century a.d. . . .) --
it's a long story in many a land -- this pervasive fiction of the self . . .

The catalog of the videotape collection here at the Poetry Center and
American Poetry Archives has just gone on-line! This on-line version of our
catalog is now the most complete listing available of our videotape
holdings. It can be accessed from our web page:

http://www.sfsu.edu./~newlit/welcome.htm

The transition from the original, extremely vexed, dbase document to
Filemaker Pro and then onto our web page (thanks to the help of Academic
Computing here at SFSU) has been somewhat difficult. The field which lists
every poem read by the each reader is the problematic one. Rather than
waiting to fix the mistakes remaining in this version, we have chosen to
put it up and invite feedback.  We will attempt to correct errors as
quickly as possible.

Someone else may have posted the information about Robert Duncan, but I
didn't see it. He actually read here in October of 1987. It was a moving
performance - his last public appearance. He died on February 3, 1988.

I agree with Robert Hale that the requirement that some family
experience be touched upon is at the heart of what some might call the
"non-innovative" or non-experimental poem (expectably,many poets are
skeptical about
creating hard and fast technical names for non- conformist kind of
poetry) I was recently asked to judge manuscripts for a poetry award and
this to me is the essence of the narrowness of much of the current
poetry I was asked to read. I
found myself saying, "mother, father, sister, brother" aloud like a mantra
as
I went through the manuscripts.The issue isn't only that"voice" is
created by reciting these words. It's that foregrounding- almost in a
kind of forced self-therapetic mode of expression-documents of one's
conflictual official
"arrival" in
the world of adult living seems to be the ritualistic expectation. I did
find one or two manuscripts that broke out of this. The main quality in
these was awareness and factoring in of other modes of living and thinking
besides ones
own, and even more importantly, within ones own, not in a didactic or
preachy way but with a credible involvement with some of life's chaos
and unpredictability.
By the way, the judging is still going on-though manuscripts are no
longer being accepted- so I can't yet supply more details.Perhaps I'll
I'll mention more about it here when I've heard about the outcome.
 I would appreciate hearing more about this piece in Poets and Writers
that you mentioned.
I never found that much in that mag to read in depth- interesting to hear
about this. By the way, I remember that you edited and published a poetry
magazine awhile back, though I can't at this moment remember its name.

Best wishes,

(This is the nearest I come to a book or reading announcement at the mom-
ent. I will be talking about Net community, poetics, software-motivated
writing and the performative, avatars, etc.)


Course Offering: Neural Neighbors: Life in the Next Millennium


I am offering a course at the Naropa Institute's School of Continuing Ed-
ucation, concerned with the present and future development of the Net and
Net communities. The description reads as follows; please contact Naropa
if you are interested (phone number is below):

Neural Neighbors: Life in the Third Millennium

Over the past 25 years, a revolution in human communication has been
spurred on by rapid advances in computer technology. The Internet, now
connecting over 50 million people, is radically changing the nature of
human relations.  No longer separated by physical distanc,e people are
meeting, connecting, and creating lasting relationships electronically.
Within this medium, the Internet user can create a 'virtual' persona,
choosing his or her age, sex, race, history. This 'virtual' reality may in
some cases become more 'real' than life away from the machine. Communica-
tion in the next millennium may well be among such 'constructed' subjects
- people creating their own identities online. Using texts from the Net,
as well as theory, this class examines the nature of these new commun-
ities, expanded relationships, and the future of the 'self.'

[Note: We shall look at a number of applications, ranging from MOOs to IRC
to email lists - covering the various modalities of on-line communities
and their development. We will also be concerned with the political econo-
my of the Net, including the divisions between information-rich and -poor
demographics. The participant will receive an overall view of the Net,
from its history to current and future developments, with an emphasis on
Net culture and its potential. In particular, we shall look at the way Net
literature is shaped by the Net, and the potential for alternative styles/
distributions/demographics, and so forth.]

The Naropa Institute is in Boulder, Colorado; the course is offered in The
Dairy building, at 2590 Walnut Street, Boulder.

Friday, Saturday, Sunday June 13 - 15

Subject:       FW: Boston Media Collective?
To:            act-ma@igc.apc.org

Hello, all!

My name is Jay -- some of you know me, and some of you don't.  I'm a
Boston-dweller and occasional freelance writer who has recently become
involved in a lot of independent media organizing.  Specifically, I'm
working on organizing the Direct Action News Center, a virtual media
collective that will provide in-the-field coverage of progressive actions,
marches, protests and campaigns and distribute the coverage worldwide
through the web.  As part of our DANC organizing we have been talking a
good deal about local media collectives and why there aren't more of them.
There are some cities that have very active media collectives that work in
different ways to increase communication (and ultimately action) among the
people who are involved in the progressive media community.  The Toronto
Media Collective meets the last Sunday of every month, and from what I hear
have contributed to an incredible cross-pollenization of organizations and
individuals that in turn has led to an increase of direct actions there.
The Los Angeles Alternative Media Network meets monthly and attracts more
than 50 people to each meeting.  Seattle has an Independent Media
Coalition, Philly and New York are holding meetings to form their own media
collective, and after a successful romp through the Democratic National
Convention and a subsequent burnout, Chicago's Countermedia is revitalizing
into a working media collective of its own.

So, what are we doing with ourselves in Boston?  Well, there are lots of
independent media people out there. Though I've only lived here a couple
years and am not around much due to my various occupations, I have crossed
paths with more than enough people who are intereted in real independent
media to make me hopeful about the things that we could do if we really put
our minds to it.  We all do great things on our own, that's for sure, but
we all know that working on own has limited possibilities.  I believe that
our work is important and necessary enough that we should make every effort
to take it to a more productive level.

What I'm proposing is that we all come together, at least once, to talk
about the possibility of forming a Boston Media Collective in order to
regularly cross wires with one another so that we may create a greater
spark.

What?? *Another project??*  In my already triply overbooked life?  Well,
not necessarily.  A Boston Media Collective could be anything that we want
it to be.  In fact, we don't have to actually *do* anything as a group, and
perhaps we shouldn't.  The Toronto Media Collective does not take action
together on any issue, as far as I understand, nor do they deal with
developing formal decision-making processes and actually agreeing on any
one thing.  They get together once a month, though, discuss their
individual projects, and then brainstorm about ways that they can help each
other.  The basic act of their meeting has inspired many of them to act
together in ways they wouldn't have if they hadn't become involved with the
Collective.  I believe that coming together once a month as the Boston
Media Collective could and should enhance and improve the effectiveness of
our current activities (rather than be an activity in and of itself), and
could therefore be very beneficial to the Boston activist community.

I propose that we meet on Sunday night, June 8, at 8pm, at my apartment in
Brighton (I'll give directions later) to tell each other about our own
projects and begin to envision how we can complement each other.  (That is
just a proposed date and time and place -- if there are any problems or
suggestions let me know a.s.a.p.)  We can see what happens there and judge
whether or not a regular monthly meeting of the minds would make sense.

So, what do you think?  Please contact me at this e-mail address
(jay@user1.channel1.com) or at (617) 783-4328 to give feedback.  Also,
please spread the word.  I am passing this message to people I know who are
connected with Radio Free Allston, the Lucy Parsons Center, Homes Not
Jails, Food Not Bombs, the Boston Commune, STEP, the Center for Campus
Organizing, the Thistle, the National Writers' Union, a variety of public
TV and video people and other individuals.  Still, not everyone involved
with each of these groups will get the message that I send, so spread the
message far and wide.

That is all for now.  I look forward to meeting those of you whom I don't
know already,

Jay

P.S.  Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control (my girlfriend
got into a phd program in a different city) I'm going to be moving out of
Boston in a couple months.  Before I go, at the very least I'd love to pull
together at least one meeting to talk about the things that a Boston Media
Collective could accomplish and to plant the idea of holding future
meetings in people's heads.  I hate to organize and run, but I figure that
it's better to give it one shot and see if anyone wants to run with it.
Who knows?

It seems that the best place to look for defintions and/or assertions of
"voice" and its importance in workshop poems is in workshop texts
themselves - i.e. the kind of guidebooks/handbooks etc. that market
themselves as such. (I can't unfortunately, name any off hand, but am sure
you could get some info. from any number of workshop teachers at any number
of universities, community colleges, etc.) Otherwise, Donald Wesling and
Tadeusz Slawek's recent _Literary Voice: The Calling of Jonah_ provides
some interesting takes on the concept and what they contend is its ongoing
value. They argue, in short, that voice mediates the two "minimal" poles of
body and text - pure orality and pure textuality - becoming "maximal",
however, not in the individual, but in the "bardic voice" - that which
speaks for the collectivity, the nation, etc. Theirs is interesting in that
they attmept to come to terms with the notion of "voice" through/against
recent critiques thereof (Grammatology etc.), using the term both literally
(orality, speech, etc) and figuratively (subject, identity, etc). They rely
heavily on Henri Meschonnic, a theorist who has done much w/
rhythm/voice/subjectivity, and who has had little if anything translated
into English that I know of (btw: if anyone does know of any such
translations, I'd love to hear of them backchannel). In any case, their
bibiliography should be helpful, as they breifly touch on both popular and
academic studies of voice from various disciplines...


Best,
Stephen Cope

              <scope@SDCC3.UCSD.EDU>

The Wesling/Slawek bk sounds interesting - another, simpler, place to start
might be Eliots short talk, "Three Voices of Poetry".  The "bardic" that W/S
value might be compared to the "impersonal" voice of communal wisdom that
Eliot finds in the greatest dramatists - the poetic voice which is not
exactly Shakespeare (or Oxford that is), nor one of his characters exactly,
but the voice that says "ripeness is all", etc.  Eliot gets into this toward
the end of his essay.

Eliot's essay is interesting in part because it's a "talk" - not a tract or
a dissertation - the voice of a real, substantial person talking to some other
people is the rhetorical ground -

He distinguishes between three voices & then suggests they are not firmly
divided, but the "first" voice infuses the rest, etc.  The first voice is
the poet writing/talking to her/himself, not immediately or directly concerned
with an audience.  He thinks "lyric" is a confusing term for this - calls it
meditative verse.  The 2nd voice is poet speaking to an audience - rhetorical,
narrative, satirical, didactic, teaching, entertaining, communicating.  3rd is
the voice of the poet/dramatist - hidden in the objective form of the play and
differentiated speakers.

Anyway, I don't want to run on rehashing this essay - but N. Piombino's point
that a lot of "workshop" "voice" poetry is a working out of family dilemmas
& "personal maturing" could be usefully related to Eliot's notion that the
1st voice is a working out of an unknown impulse, an impulse to comprehend
or bring to form "psychic material" whose ONLY meaning (for the poet) is it's
expression, its bringing-to-form, in the poem.  And one could take a socio-
logical approach and compare the setting for "meditative verse" in previous
eras - the function of prayer & psalm for unburdening the heart or dealing
with trouble or expressing love in a "personal" way which is yet social -
compare this to the academic setting in which "voice" is taught for a living
and composed for assignments & graded, etc. - and you begin to see problems
with a separate "discipline" of creative writing which in my opinion are not
resolved by taking a theoretical approach which designates "voice", or "self"
or logos or speech simply as the illusory ideological framework to be
jettisoned.  I think voice, self, logos, can be taken as GIVEN! Ha ha!! But
the impulse for form-creation and where it comes from & what the poet does
with it - these are the deep issues for the POET at least.

I recommend Eliot's talk.  Also Paul Celan's talk - I forget where, title,
etc. - in which in a roundabout way he says that the voice in poetry is what
suffuses & then transcends/overcomes the artifice & alienation inherent in
all art & representation.  I think he does this sort of in terms of a parable,
... maybe Pierre or somebody can fill in here... poetry the culmination or
sanction for art... the simple human voice coming full circle...
Sandra & Elmo, I'd like you to write papers on this for next semester...

i've found eve sedgwick's "a poem is being written" to be a nice meditation
on the link between nuclear family, with its private humiliations and
scrutiny, and the lyric. robert lowell's poetry i believe bears this out,
as i tried to write about in my lowell section in my book.

Henry,

You may be combining two recollections of Celan's prose: the first, the
"parable," is probably "Conversation in the Mountains" (1959)-- certainly
"about" voice and poetry, but from an oblique angle:

"'He says, he says...Do you hear me, he says...And Do-you-hear-me, of
course, Do-you-hear-me does not say anything, does not answer, because
Do-you-hear-me is one with the glaciers, is three in one, and not for men..."

The second, which _is_ a speech: "The Meridian" (1960)--delivered "on the
occasion of receiving the Georg Buchner Prize"-- is probably what you
mainly had in mind:

"It is true, the poem, the poem today, shows-- and this has only
indirectly to do with the difficulties of vocabulary, the faster flow of
syntax or a more awakened sense of ellipsis, none of which we should
underrate-- the poem clearly shows a strong tendency towards silence.

The poem holds its ground, if you will permit me yet another extremem
formulation, the poem holds its ground on its own margin.  In order to
endure, it constantly calls and pulls itself back from an
'already-no-more' [Schon-nicht-mehr] into a 'still-here' [Immer-noch].

This 'still-here' can only mean speaking.  Not language as such, but
responding and--not just verbally-- 'corresponding' to something.

In other words: language actualized, set free under the sign of a radical
individuation which, however, remains as aware of the limits drawn by
language as of the possibilities it opens.

This 'still-here' of the poem can only be found in the work of poets who
do not forget that they speak from an angle of reflection which is their
own existence, their own physical nature.

This shows the poem yet more clearly as one person's language become
shape and, essentially, a presence in the present."

Best,
O.

)ne such guidebook is THE PRACTICE OF POETRY (Behn, Twichell 1992) which
contains several exercises contributed by writers who teach workshops.
There's one I find particularly telling--Jim Simmerman's "Twenty Little

It seems that the best place to look for defintions and/or assertions of
"voice" and its importance in workshop poems is in workshop texts
themselves - i.e. the kind of guidebooks/handbooks etc. that market
themselves as such. (I can't unfortunately, name any off hand, but am sure
you could get some info. from any number of workshop teachers at any number
of universities, community colleges, etc.) Otherwise, Donald Wesling and
Tadeusz Slawek's recent _Literary Voice: The Calling of Jonah_ provides
some interesting takes on the concept and what they contend is its ongoing
value. They argue, in short, that voice mediates the two "minimal" poles of
body and text - pure orality and pure textuality - becoming "maximal",
however, not in the individual, but in the "bardic voice" - that which
speaks for the collectivity, the nation, etc. Theirs is interesting in that
they attmept to come to terms with the notion of "voice" through/against
recent critiques thereof (Grammatology etc.), using the term both literally
(orality, speech, etc) and figuratively (subject, identity, etc). They rely
heavily on Henri Meschonnic, a theorist who has done much w/
rhythm/voice/subjectivity, and who has had little if anything translated
into English that I know of (btw: if anyone does know of any such
translations, I'd love to hear of them backchannel). In any case, their
bibiliography should be helpful, as they breifly touch on both popular and
academic studies of voice from various disciplines...

Hello everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  Can any of you brains out there back
channel me with answers to 3 questions?

1.  What was the date of the conviction of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?
Were there 2 separate trials or just one?  And also, the date of the
execution(s)?  Now that's cheerful, eh?

2.  Does anyone know the address of the poet Mark Doty?

3.  Or of the novelist Ishmael Reed?


No prizes, only thanks from a California air head . . .

Actually, Bill, I found a copy of the flyer (I'm vacationing this week,
doing my own elegant or non-elegant writing).  Here's what Renee really
wrote:

"Clamour's primary focus is to present and encourage experimentation and
discourse among dykes."

I was pretty close, don't you think?

And I do hope some of you non-dykes out there come to the reading.  This is
very interesting work here.

I mentioned the Practice of Poetry in an earlier post. Thinking about it, I
would also have to contend that, while not a guidebook, Poulin's
Contemporary American Poetry (4th ed.--the big red one) is as much
responsible for the way a lot of young writers write as anything. Being an
"MFA factory" graduate myself, I can tell you that there is hardly a young
poet out there who was not issued that book as an undergraduate.

NAME THAT FAMOUS POET!

Here is the first half of a poem from POET X followed by the book's blurbs.
What is curious to me is that if there is such a thing as emphasis on
'voice,' it certainly is a generic one.

        My daughter comes to me
        with her sorrow. She is
        not yet ten, not yet
        insistent for her father.
        As if waiting out a sentence
        she sits at the round table,
        her long black shawl of hair
        framing high cheek bones.
        She thinks she is ugly,
        thinks she has no friends...


The blurbs which grace the back cover of the book from which this poem was
taken call X's work "rich with lyric observation," "eloquent and deeply
provocative," "technically impeccable," "tantalizing, supremely crafted,
sublime." X is "one of the most important poets writing today."

luigi and others -

As luck would have it, you may have tried to access the catalog during its
weekly reindexing, which apparently takes about five minutes - It is
working now, at least from SFSU - My contact at Academic Computing here
responds with lightning swiftness to any complaints, so please continue to
contact me if you have any problems getting into the collection -

Thanks for the various good lucks - I'm sure we will need it to overcome
the glitches -

I think the usage dates from the re-building of the "White House" after it
was burned down by the British in the War of 1812. Not sure, though. I
recall a story about  Jackons' first inaugural party in 1820 (?). The man of
the people invited the people to the mansion and was subsequently mobbed.
"The guests"  ripped up curtains for souvenirs and in general stole anything
unattached. It got so bad Jackson was pressed against the wall, about to be
crushed -  his aides then formed a wedge, pushed through the crowd, busted
out a window, and lowered the Prez to the ground. He spent the night in his
usual place - a tavern (which per custom had rooms to let upstairs).

does anyone know when the White House began popularly to be known as "the
White House?"  I thought it was called "the Executive Mansion" until the
administration of Theodore Roosevelt. But I just heard Thoreau referring to
it in CAPE COD as the White House.

From a review I found on the web, of _The Rosenberg Letters_:

"The Rosenberg case coincides almost exactly with the Korean War. In July
1950, three weeks after the war began, Julius Rosenberg was arrested on
charges of conspiracy to transmit atomic secrets to the Soviet Union; his
wife Ethel was arrested on the same charges in August. Unable to raise
bail, the couple spent the last three years of their lives in prison.

"The trial itself took place in March 1951, and ended in a guilty verdict.
Although Judge Irving Kaufman handed down the death penalty in April, the
sentence was delayed for the next twenty-six months, pending various legal
appeals and two separate appeals for clemency to then-President Eisenhower.
The Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953, the only
persons in American history executed for spying after trial in a civil
court. Fighting in Korea ended in the month following their deaths."

(This may be of interest to anyone who has looked at the Jennifer and
other materials I have been working with - delete otherwise. Originally
sent to Cybermind/FOP-l lists.)


BODY-HTML


I wish to return to issues of body-html, in light of the experiments I've
been running in Javascript. A webpage currently has four levels epistemo-
logically (ignoring, for the moment, the distinction between sound/sight/
text): semantic markup (content-control negotiated between client and ser-
ver); the texts/graphics themselves; style-sheets and other design-orien-
ted content; and scripting/programming, which active the page.

There are exceptions: REFRESH and BLINK, for example, are active elements
in HTML; links themselves are a call for action on the part of the reader;
forms are almost entirely designed within HTML, javascript can modify sem-
antic markup according to browser, and so forth.

Beneath the surface appearance (which, like any superstructure, tends to-
wards an imaginary autonomy), there are interactions among HTML, Perl and
CGI, Java, Javascript, ActiveX, and so forth.

The body of the page splits uneasily into appearance and marrow; the body-
html is the inversion of html-elements, or the appearance of the webpage
as organism. If the page appears to "have a life of its own," nothing is
changed ontologically or epistemologically, but the implications are that
one is in _negotiation_ with something close to the dream of a bot or ava-
tar. The page _is_ that bot/avatar for the moment; diachronically, there
may be a history of such, and synchronically, the appearance of the organ-
ic may be "smeared" across a number of pages, programs, or other aspects
of the Net.

Call them aspects; avatars connect, reference no essential or background
node, continue as _uneasy_ text which foregrounds them. This may also be
taken as a model of communications in which superstructural elements, such
as the sitcom, appear to reference actors and situations - but the refer-
ence may already be broken epistemologically or ontologically (re: Baud-
rillard, etc.).

The avatar such as Jennifer references a different epistemology altogether
- clearly, she is not an actor, nor is she in a _situation._ Instead, she
may well be part of a cultivated psychosis on the part of the author/ess,
one which treats html-body as signal or flag of a _condition,_ organic or
otherwise.

Or rather, a condition which develops its own superstructural coherence,
the html-body as mirror-stage refracting, not reflecting, the author, ac-
cording to _its_ whims.

These sites: page, code, script, author, reader, writer, viewer, partici-
pant, text/image/audio, become increasingly difficult to disentangle -
which is precisely the point; this is also the condition of the lived body
which cannot separate its _I_ from its _eye,_ and its _I_ from that of
others or the language within which it was born/graded. The _history_ is
different, as are the traumas, but - and I'm _not_ talking on the level of
the symptom - the superstructure, _from wherever,_ becomes someone/some-
thing else.

Thus the superstructure/avatar, like the other, is unaccountable and unac-
counted-for. It is unaccountable because it is smeared across sites (pa-
ges, codes, scripts, authors, readers, writers...), and it is unaccounted-
for, because it has the appearance of Venus or Athena emergent, not-there
but a psychotopogpraphy - in truth psychotropology.

Personhood as well is never _there,_ and Jennifer in fact is Jennifer(),
function or potential bracketing, loose collocation of signifiers and
leakages which appear to be foreclosed (the _super_ of the structure) just
as psychosis is all too neat a package.

ii

The seething and seduction of the webpage: the page _seethes_ as it is ac-
tivated, leads out of itself, churns around an attractor; and the page is
the locus of a _seduction_ towards itself, the proffering of part-objects
for consumption by the participant. These objects may be _repetitive_ and/
or _mirroring_; they operate through introjections/projections, through
hysteric embodiments (see Internet Text), through the collusion of the
dream and the imaginary. Text/image/sound fall to the level of the ground,
(re)construct it. This combination of seething and seduction, I call (con-
tinuous) _rewrite,_ the re-presencing of the self/avatar as obsessive-com-
pulsive construct. Above all, Jennifer and body-html say, _return_: my
body depends on it.

The _minimal interaction_ in Flaubert expands into a/his crystalline world
of Salammbo, Bovary, Bouvard and Pecuchet. Seething is internalized, fore-
closed; one jumps the text-as-hypertext, and (Vygotsky) inner-speech
stresses the seduction. There are no leaks, except for the fleeting pre-
sence of _that woman in the hat turning the corner_ ... The interaction in
html-body leaks, just as personhood leaks; the speech appears not always
as "inner," as one's own, but instead emanates from dispersion (what I
call elsewhere "emission").

So that it becomes, for example, _the name Jennifer_ which recuperates the
seething/opening of the pages, returns them to a somewhat fractured unary
disposition. It is the insertion into language (icon, symbolic) that pre-
cisely allows (her) escaping towards the leakiness inherent in html-body,
as if the blood were produced by "blood" which is close <BLOOD> to the
case </BLOOD>.

And it is _the name Jennifer_ which is itself semantic markup: <JENNIFER>
text image sound </JENNIFER> or the Jennifer-function in the Jennifer-link
at http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ that tend towards these ir-
ruptions, presaged and accompanied by bots, morphs, players, and all vari-
ous others, organic and other/wise.

I may find this and its like objectionable for different reasons than many
on the list. The problem is not, as I see it, the quotidian drama, but that
it's neither particularized nor contextualized, which facilitates its
anonymous sleekness. When Donne writes "The Ecstasie" he goes beyond the
conventional lyric with its tacit assumption of the universality of the
sentiment (love being, amazingly, among the more common of miraculous
events) to a close analysis of the minutiae of the experience, using the
best tools available to him for his investigation. The mind probing is made
visible. A possible and particular mind in a given context is made visible.
This thing, on the other hand, draws what little it has to offer from the
assumption of universality--its lack of particularity and context place it
in the ideal, clean world of straightforward emotional responses and very
green lawns. It's the world of the terminal suburb, where all of our
problems are little ones, in which the poet flatters us that he and we belong.

that poem by Famous Poet X was really written by IBM-clone Dirty Zinc,
a computer in Prague, Hungary.  Don't ask me how Prague became part of
Hungary.  It won an award in a poem tournament in Florida last year,
beating out 340 human poets and a poetry-writing german shepherd named Orf.

Here's my favorite quote, by a writer whose reviewing practices I would in
general hesitate to champion, but he pretty much nails it here:

"When, in praising a poet, it is said that he has `found his voice own
voice' what is usually meant is that he has developed a manner of
self-dramatization sufficiently consistent that a single persona seems to
be the source of all his poems. `Voice' in this sense equates with a manner
of delivery, a stance, a style that the audience may not share but that it
can at least recognize from a distance, like a traffic sign."

                --Thomas Disch, from _The Castle of Indolence_ (New York:
Picador,1995) p.152
The context, BTW, is a review of volumes by Raymond Carver and Brad
Leithauser, originally published in the nation.

is not true. But I remember the time we were in the bookstore. I told him
to cause a distraction at another part of the store while I stuck a bunch
of Robert Frost books under my jacket. So away I went, and he jumped up and

I'd like to look at voice in context of Mark Wallace's statement several
weeks ago about "the individual"--Mark's posts have gotten both of these
threads going--but there's not been much discussion of the individual in
the posts on voice.  Voice being an aspect of "craft," suppose, doesn't hit
quite so close to center as questioning individuality (I dunno, maybe it
does).  But by questioning voice I think we are questioning individuality.
Why is a voice in a poem different from one's voice in conversation?
Because the literary voice is a construct?  And the conversational voice
isn't?

I found a quote quite by accident as I was reading through the Oxford Guide
to 20th C Poetry (a desk copy turned up in my Departmental box just as I
was off to give an exam).  Anyway, the Robert Kelly entry contains this
quote: "my work is not _my_ work. . .my personality is its enemy."
Slightly different terms ("personality" rather than "individuality," but a
similar concern I think).

One textbook I've used for beginning Creative Writing courses (I couldn't
find it today, though) spent part of chapter at least debunking the idea of
"voice"--but only for emerging/beginning writers.  Voice was not something
to be discovered but something to be developed.  I wish I could find the
exact reference (I don't think it was _The Practice of Poetry_, though
Daniel Tessatore's post makes me think it may have been).  I had the
peculiar sense that the author was engaging in a kind of territorial
protection--"voice" was a concern of established writers, you young'uns
best get back to the woodshed. That is, "voice" was to be developed through
careful practice--the "craft" aspect, I think, that  Joe Amato mentioned.

And yes, this does relate to the individual, to personality even.

The individual is a story we tell (often to ourselves) to trace the
trajectory of the changes we go through.  But this of course assumes there
is an unchaging core (the "indivudual") to which (to whom) these changes
occur.  But the core is change, a shifting field of relations between
memories, responses, predictions.  Think of yourself when you were 15, or
8?  Who _was_ that?  What voice did they have?

This sounds very intriguing, Maria. I'm as yet unfamiliar, embarassed to
admit,
with
the sedgwick poem, or- - your book(uh...what were those titles, again?)
including the work on Lowell, whose
line "The monument sticks like a fishbone/ in the city's throat"
speaking of Washington D.C., has always haunted me.Could you further
explain the connection?

I've been interested in this issue for a long time, and in an article
orginally published in The Difficulties in 1982 and republished in my
essay book The Boundary of Blur I suggested a distinction connected with
the issues you
explore at the end of the post below. I  used the analogy of a tree,
comparing the self with the bark of the tree and the identity with the
xylem of the tree, vulnerable and within. This was part of a discussion
on Charles Bernstein's poem Poetic Justice called THE TASTE IS WHAT
COUNTS. Mark Wallace discusses this issue with relation to contemporary
poetics in WITZ Summer 1996 in his Towards A Multiplicity of Form:
"A free multiplicity of form is not the same as a multiplicity of
individuals speaking in their own individual "voices" without
awareness of form or any possibility of cultural impact, each equally
unable to have any ground other than other than their own subjectivity
from which to speak" He also talks about Taproot Reviews, the book Core: A
Symposium on Contemporary Visual Poetry, An Ear to The Ground:An Anthology
of Contemporary American Poetry, the magazine Phoebe, his own Situation
and his dialogues with Jefferson Hansen, recently out from Poetic Briefs.

Dean --

good remarks re: the vox conundrum -- yes "personality" is (among
what's) perhaps at issue --

sure much is involved in & wheels around such discussions (in these
parallel threads: voce & individuality), & it's scarcely to be presumed
that a sprawl of poets will be always speaking same lingo -- particularly
where some analysis may sharpen focus on what tacks of metaphysics,
psychology, philosophy (et alia) may (tend to) underpin our (respective)
pin-cushions --

I hap (fr instance) to favor a Jungianish model, where outer layers of
personality are (onion-like) felt to obscure more archaic (subconscious)
strata of an overall (arcane, multi-tiered, elusive, spheroid) "self" --

problematics of the self (& its mapping) are no doubt opening (shifting?)
in curious ways in present poetics --

while unquestioning acceptance of "the voice notion" wd seem startling
for its blithe simplifications --

yet definitive rejection of the existence of an individual "voice" can seem
puzzling for its knotty & knotted implications --

between campsites, what median, misty, or tentative trails curl?

Hello everyone.

I'm new to the conversation and enjoying.

I'm also looking for an address (or info) for _The Village Voice_. I
understand they used to do poetry reviews, but I've heard their
editorial department changed.

Does anyone know if they still do poetry reviews and does anyone have an
address? (I called New York info and they give me the number to the
Lincoln Center.)

I'm puzzled that so many here cede the idea of "voice" to a particular
and isolated realm.  This seems to give up a lot.  Can only "MFA", lyric,
"family", etc. poets have "voice"?

        Celan's essays can be found in translation in Collected Prose.
trans. Rosemarie Waldrop.  Sheep Meadow Press, Riverdale on Hudson, N.Y.
1986. The essays are the "major" statements he has made about poetry. The
letters to Nelly Sachs, also available in English trans. (publisher etc.
I cannot recall at the moment). In those letters there are remarks,
moments, sentences, phrases, and even at times, paragraphs when he is more
explicit in his stance[s] towards his own poetry, and toward poetry in
general. Felstiner's book also gathers many loose threads of Celan, and is
a marvelous machine for garnering  Celan's thoughts about the work
he was doing. - Paul Celan, Poet, Survivor, Jew. Yale University Press,

I may find this and its like objectionable for different reasons than many
on the list. The problem is not, as I see it, the quotidian drama, but that
it's neither particularized nor contextualized, which facilitates its
anonymous sleekness. When Donne writes "The Ecstasie" he goes beyond the
conventional lyric with its tacit assumption of the universality of the
sentiment (love being, amazingly, among the more common of miraculous
events) to a close analysis of the minutiae of the experience, using the
best tools available to him for his investigation. The mind probing is made
visible. A possible and particular mind in a given context is made visible.

This thing, on the other hand, draws what little it has to offer from the
assumption of universality--its lack of particularity and context place it
in the ideal, clean world of straightforward emotional responses and very
green lawns. It's the world of the terminal suburb, where all of our
problems are little ones, in which the poet flatters us that he and we
belong.

Thank you--you nailed it perfectly. The 'assumption of universality' is

I've been thinking more about the Poulin anthology since mentioning it

I'd like to look at voice in context of Mark Wallace's statement several
weeks ago about "the individual"--Mark's posts have gotten both of these
threads going--but there's not been much discussion of the individual in
the posts on voice.  Voice being an aspect of "craft," suppose, doesn't hit
quite so close to center as questioning individuality (I dunno, maybe it
does).  But by questioning voice I think we are questioning individuality.
Why is a voice in a poem different from one's voice in conversation?
Because the literary voice is a construct?  And the conversational voice
isn't?
________________

I think an argument can be made (perhaps it has) that all voices are
constructs--literary, conversational. The conversational voice(s) we use
may be constructs even if they are learned rather than developed ones.

________________

I found a quote quite by accident as I was reading through the Oxford Guide
to 20th C Poetry (a desk copy turned up in my Departmental box just as I
was off to give an exam).  Anyway, the Robert Kelly entry contains this
quote: "my work is not _my_ work. . .my personality is its enemy."
Slightly different terms ("personality" rather than "individuality," but a
similar concern I think).
________________

Eliot put forth this same notion, though perhaps more roundaboutly in
Tradition and..., which I think about every time I read any kind of
guidebooks or reviews or blurbs that praise the notion of voice in some
way. I think his idea of the writer's obligation to leave personality
behind was one of his primary cautions to the would-be writer, and it's
amazing to me how it seems to go totally ignored in contemporary mainstream
work.
________________

One textbook I've used for beginning Creative Writing courses (I couldn't
find it today, though) spent part of chapter at least debunking the idea of
"voice"--but only for emerging/beginning writers.  Voice was not something
to be discovered but something to be developed.  I wish I could find the
exact reference (I don't think it was _The Practice of Poetry_, though
Daniel Tessatore's post makes me think it may have been).  I had the
peculiar sense that the author was engaging in a kind of territorial
protection--"voice" was a concern of established writers, you young'uns
best get back to the woodshed. That is, "voice" was to be developed through
careful practice--the "craft" aspect, I think, that  Joe Amato mentioned.
___________________

The Practice of Poetry does contain a chapter called 'The Self and Its
Subjects: A. Aspects of Voice, and B. What's It About?' I'll take a retour
through this soon and see what I can find.
___________________

And yes, this does relate to the individual, to personality even.

The individual is a story we tell (often to ourselves) to trace the
trajectory of the changes we go through.  But this of course assumes there
is an unchaging core (the "indivudual") to which (to whom) these changes
occur.  But the core is change, a shifting field of relations between
memories, responses, predictions.  Think of yourself when you were 15, or
8?  Who _was_ that?  What voice did they have?

Of course not.  But the idea of "voice," or getting one at least (as
opposed to a job) is critical in the world of MFA programs because of the
nature of the beast.  The "voice" in poetry workshops is like fashion
sense: those with the best will get noticed, the rest will fade into the
woodwork.  When everyone is writing the same kind of poem, these surface
distinctions become very important (if my voice/poem/shirt is interesting,
then the professor will spend more than five minutes talking about my work,
and maybe I'll get one of those prizes they hand out every semester).

But I also think there's something more interesting about "voice" than
that.  The phrase "finding your voice" is shorthand for describing the
transitions writers go through, particularly the first one where things
start to click, where craft and intention and subject matter come together
a lot more successfully than in previous attempts.  MFA programs love to
take credit for this event (upon completion of my MFA I found my voice and
my skin cleared up too!) That is one of their problems.  The workshop is
intended to foster these transitions, but the what and how of making this
transition is ultimately personal, mysterious, even random.  The shop can
do as much harm as good.  And the writer might not "find their voice" until
years after leaving the workshop.  So why go get an MFA if you might just
as easily "find your voice" while doing your dishes or during your coffee
break?  Ideally the workshop will accelerate the process, but often it
won't.  And often writers emerge from their programs thinking they have
made that first leap when in truth all they've done is written more
polished versions of their entrance manuscripts.

I just spent the weekend talking with one of the people who went through
the MFA program at Arizona with me, and we figured out that in just four
years, less than a quarter of our graduating class were still writing (let
alone writing better than when they graduated).

Perhaps that's where MFA programs get it wrong: the goal isn't to find your
voice, but to find a way to keep speaking.

(having never been in a karaoke bar, I can merely imagine.  Well, guess I

more to the point?) variant on the anthology-as-zoo observation of David
Antin's (mentioned on the list some months ago)

* for a pop singer who sings (on demand / by expectation) "favorite

could avoid dilusions of self-karaoke-ing . . .  (dilutions of grandeur)

* more broadly construed, to what degree might any / every literary
tradition be susceptible to aspects of a karaoke simile?

* where does Sid Vicious's rendition of "My Way" fit in? (is his the
LangPo sendup, or what?)

history note: circa '89, Penny Arcade did a Nancy riff (re-enacted that
persona -- in a small performance series at The Chelsea, NYC -- said Sid

Mark:

There was, in the early 70's, I think, an anthology called _The Voice
that Is Great within Us_. You might check that out for prologial
theorizing. Early on, around that time, there may have have been some
connection between the voice theorists and Walter Ong's work on
orality and the ontology of voice (Ong is very interesting, by the
way). The concept quickly deteriorated, in any case, into a proposal
about the sound of the "authentic self" with attendent therapeutic
possibilities and "identity" related developments. There's probably a
connection there, as well, with the then widely popularized work of
post-Freudians like Perleman and Erikson and their theories of
the development of psychic authenticity.

I like the way Hugh described it all in this post.  The complex thing though
about "finding your voice" is that it's as much social/impersonal as
it is personal/mysterious.  It can be likened maybe to the way painters
get in a groove, find a means, find confidence to go in a new direction.
It's based on milieu, training (education), background, character, reading
- but also on inspiration or "occasion".  I think poets "find their voice"
by rising to the occasion.  It's a cognitive/social/inspirational
occasion.  That's why the poem or work often seems to have pre-existed -
the poet found it.  & that's why MFA programs don't have a recipe for
this.  The milieu is too narrow & the occasion stays away; the outcome is -
academic.  But that doesn't mean MFA programs are all bad - at least
they provide people with the "occasion" to allow themselves to write.
Some people need it.  But the great milieu is where poetry is just "out
there" - in the working free groups - and alone, AGAINST the groups & their
mechanical robot critics (the critical reception, say, of Philip Guston's
late work is paradigmatic).  Guston is illustrative of the personal/
social dynamics of this.  He withdraws from art scene where he was already
a mighty force - he starts painting these strange cartoon-like pictures
of KKK men among piles of trash, etc. (this is late 60s early 70s I think)
- his father was a garbage collector who had killed himself - the work is
totally dumped on by the critics - prefigures so much painting of later
decades - this is an example of painter "finding his voice" - also perhaps
an example of how the group, the society, allows certain figures to play
out the personal in a conflicted way - Henry G.

The critique of "voice" predates language poetry:

VOICE

I have always laughed
when someone spoke of a young writer
"finding his voice." I took it
literally: had he lost his voice?
Had he thrown it and had it
not returned? Or perhaps they
were referring to his newspaper
_The Village Voice_? He's trying
to find his _Voice_.
        What isn't
funny is that so many young writers
seem to have found this notion
credible: they set off in search
of their voice, as if it were
a single thing, a treasure
difficult to find but worth
the effort. I never thought
such a thing existed. Until
recently. Now I know it does.
I hope I never find mine. I
wish to remain a phony the rest of my life.

that book, edited by hayden carruth, was my bible in high school. it
introduced me to bob kaufman, james merrill, robert creeley and others.  i
still have that beat up copy.  i felt that it *was* the great voice within
me, coming from somewhere else, esp when i read creeley (it turned out that
my poetry teacher had studied w/ creeley so that must have been why).
like, later, reading bruno schultz, that feeling of having one's
dream-voices ventriloquized by someone you hadn't known existed...

Hey Nick, the "fishbone" line is wonderfully appropriate to DC and the Big
White Dick, but it's actually from "For the Union Dead" and refers to
Colonel Shaw and his "colored" Civil War regiment.

there's a very simple reason why people do ma, mfa, phd programs, etc. to
stay out of the grueling, dispiriting job market/unemployment treadmill for
a few years in relatively comfortable, respectable, and stimulating
circumstances.  i went to grad school to hide out the reagan years. if
there were any degree that could  have lasted longer than a phd program
(which can be parlayed into 7 or 8 years) i would have done that.  i
enjoyed it, got a lot out of it, etc., but basically i was helping keep
down the unemployment and the chronically- marginally-employed rate.

The critique of "voice" predates language poetry:

VOICE

I have always laughed
when someone spoke of a young writer
"finding his voice." I took it
literally: had he lost his voice?
Had he thrown it and had it
not returned? Or perhaps they
were referring to his newspaper
_The Village Voice_? He's trying
to find his _Voice_.
        What isn't
funny is that so many young writers
seem to have found this notion
credible: they set off in search
of their voice, as if it were
a single thing, a treasure
difficult to find but worth
the effort. I never thought
such a thing existed. Until
recently. Now I know it does.
I hope I never find mine. I
wish to remain a phony the rest of my life.

I found one of the graduates from the Creative Writing program I was in (a
PhD program, not an MFA) on the National Empowerment Network (I don't know
how many of you have that--it's far right politcal programming).  He was
(may still be) the editor of Campus Watch, the folks who expose all the
liberals undermining this great nation of ours, etc, etc.  Anyway, this
fiction writer bills himself as an expert in education, proudly displaying
his degree (Dr. Mark Draper, PhD) in the masthead of Campus Watch. I called
up (it was a call in show) and asked him how he felt about Creative Writing
PhDs, since he was on a tirade against liberal arts programs undermining
traditional education values.  He got a bit flustered, I guess, and handed
the question over the Phyllis Schlafly, who was also on the panel.  I
didn't get to say anything after that.

He found a way to keep speaking, using "fictionalizing" skills he picked up
in a Creative Writing program.

Tuesday May 13th at Intersection for the Arts in S.F., Drew Gardner and
Joel Deane read in Drew's first S.F. reading since leaving for New York
City last year.  Joel Deane, who recently moved here from Melbourne,
Australia, read his brooding, serious poems, dialogues, and stories first.
Although many in the audience had apparently come to see Joel, he only read
two lines that really grabbed me:

my father is a model discontinued
a face is ubiquitous, he thinks

Drew followed after a short break.  Those of us who had come to see him
(Elizabeth Robinson, Tina Rotenberg, Avery Burns, Garrett, Brian Lucas,
Andrew Joron, Steve Dickison, Pat Reed and Chris Daniels) had fun listening
to the contrast between his last S.F. poems and the newer N.Y. poems:

the crescent moon holds the liquid mind like a cup
mean furnitures of light threaten
learning to change the lobster into a valuable helper
beachcombing machines
to crawl with wings above the hemoglobin flags
one emptiness shifting as a bathtub on the sea
only sound will never change the necessary running
where spring is a language of direct experience
vanishing houses leaned against the mental tree
the numbered nothings go
an unseen bowl has come hidden from the yes
o internal mosh pit!
to eat away the sun is not a question of being mean
the inside of a severed thought is not a question
don't freak.  become a reverse suicide.  refuse nothing to god.

...and then it was tapas again (love those tapas desserts--this time I got
the chocalte mousse.  If only someone had killed me after the first bite I
wouldn't have to live with this yearning for more!)  We went to Picaro's
and reminisced about its days as a dingy cafe.  Drew's headed for Seattle
til next Monday, and then Saturday the 24th he's playing a jazz gig at
Radio Valencia, which I strongly recommend catching if you're around as
Drew's jazz noises are fantastic.

Music. Singing.

Alongside the spectral, soul-ful 'notion' of voice 'within' or 'without'
is the concrete, and not unrelated, vibrations, movements of throat,
larynx, the forced air through the resonators of the facial musculature
(the 'mask' of trained singing jargon), the minutia of glottis, the
aural possibilities of opera-house, tavern, head-phones, closet. Wayne
Koestenbaum's _The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery
of Desire_ intones beautifully on the social construction of 'voice' as
it is heard and as it comes to mean more than its singularity and/or
simulations of reproducibility-- either as repertoire (neither is
Karaoke *merely* about a pure lip-sync vetriloquy but rather,
importantly, about repetition *and* difference), in voice
'training'(Koestenbaum writes hilariously and insightfully of voice
training manuals, and what it would mean to have a 'trained' voice) or
compared to 'other' voices, other divas.

"This ideology of 'voice' as original and identity-bestowing took root
in . . . a time when sexuality evolved as the darkness we yearn to
illuminate, a constituative hiddeness . . . Like the arts of asceticism
that, according to Foucault, constituted early modern sexuality, voice
is a set of rules for withholding and dispensing a natural, numinous and
dangerously volatile substance . . . What if voice were, finally, a more
useful rubric than 'sexuality'? Dispense with our sex rhetorics, and
think of desire as articulated air, a shaped column of breath passing
through a box on its way to a resonator. Are we experiencing 'voice' or
'sexuality' when we greet or hold a controlled shaft of air moving from
a dark place out into the world?"

One of the most depressing moments during my years in arts adminstration
was serving on the selection panel for a large multi-disciplinary
fellowship program from a state agency.  I was there as a music specialist,
but got to/had to read/see/smell the work samples in every discipline.  It
was a very long process.

I had a helluva time trying to make clear what I felt was wrong with a
short story writer who had the personal voice thing DOWN, it was like
reading a transcript of a stand-up comic who works a lot with catch
phrases.  This writer had even published two stories in different
collections that were Mad-Lib versions of each other.  Only some of the
words were changed; the entire structure, down to sentence order & phrases
within the sentences, was EXACTLY the same.  (If this was some kind of
formal experiment, it was the only one this writer has ever tried.)

Of course, I was the only one to vote against it & the writer recieved a
big chunk of cash.  Oh, well.

And I'd like to say that my dog-eared copy of same is still held in such

seen since.

Steve,
        I want to thank you for your reportage on SF readings, and to ask how
your selection of lines might relate to the current "voice" discussion,
i.e., does your selection reflect a "voice" you "hear" more than
others--a transpersonal voice incarnating itself occasionally in various
poets who happen to have listened to the same channel on Cocteau's
radio? Do those lines resonate with your own "voice"? Do they contrast
with or reply to it? Do they exemplify exactly what you would, after
hearing them, strive never to imitate or reproduce in any even
paraphrasable rendition/karaoke? You seem in a good position to
contribute something to this "voice" discussion. Wouldja, wouldja?

Subject:      "voice"?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello Poetics Listees,
In Sydney in November 1995 a poetry conference called "The Whole Voice" was
held. Laurie Duggan presented a "paper" sceptical of the notion of
"voice"...it's published in the latest issue of "Southerly" - Vol.57 No 1
Autumn 1997 - ("Southerly" can be found on the EPC website small magazine list).

Laurie's piece is called "What Whole Voice ? Notes For A Reading" and I'll
quote from the section "Metaphysics"
"What is this thing called "the voice"? I take it to be a metaphysical
concept which represents "authority". It is a humanist concept of
"authorisation"; of power over "lesser breeds without the law." It is
logocentric. When "voice" is used in the context of this conference it is
actually the "mind of the poet" (or "poetic" voice) which is the privileged
item: an integrated mind; a mind with "integrity". Someone I know once
prefaced a remark on poetics with the inclusive/exclusive "we poets..." - as
though there were some poetic way of seeing things and that "we poets" were
the privileged viewers (or "seers"). The "humanism" of "the voice" is, in
this light, merely the backwash of romanticism. If "the voice" is "whole" in
this sense, it is the "organic" (and "coherent" voice); the product of a
constituted and authenticated "body of poetry".

he continues with reflections on "voice"  in "Performance" and so on...and a
quote from the concluding section "Silence"...

"The poem of "the voice" is too wrapped up in its own importance to leave
any breathing space. It's a dead letter...."

I post this because I agree with it.
Best wishes,
Pam Brown

While I agree that this is a marvelous quote, and I agree with all the
critiques of the notion of voice that have been expressed here lately (the
ones I read, I'm sure I missed a few), I would like to add one tiny sour
note to all of this--namely in the works of poets who oppose the notion of
voice, many a time I've seen their non-voice just as wrapped up in its own
importance as the voice mentioned above.

I appreciate this discussion.  It has clarified the panic I feel on the
rare occasions I hear "workshop" poetry, when I drive Kevin crazy trailing
him around, asking for assurance, "I don't do that, right, Kevin, I don't,
right?"  This discussion have given me some distance from that gut-level
revulsion, the space to meditate upon exactly what I'm finding
problematic--and how that relates to my own interest in narrative and
"self."

How 'bout that! And all this time I thought...Could you elaborate on
this a bit? What's the monument and how does regiment come into it? I
don't have a copy of the poem, and even if I did I might not have
deciphered this.
Thanks, Gwyn

a new book of mine from Prest Roots Press:
  Three Forest Conformities 41 pp (includes a 3pp essay). Available

  Nice to see The Prelude turning up in the conversations. It must
have been an announcement once itself, though a posthumous one. Is
that the sort this list now prefers?

Excuse me, poets, but I would like to break in with a few questions, since
there is a lot of implicit knowledge circulating re this thread, which it
would help me, at least [an outsider], to make explicit.  You all know, I
assume, that "Homer" is just a traditional name for a figure who, in any
case, cannot have been the "author" of the Iliad or the Odyssey. "Homer"
was just a voice who was able to pull together the best lines of his
generation....  Is this common knowledge among you?

"Homer"'s style was formulaic, *very* formulaic, which is to say that it
operated largely, and successfully, with cliches.  Is this common knowledge
among you?

As far as epic goes, in its Ur-sense, the Iliad and the Odyssey are not
"epic" *because* they are long, or war-like, or national or tribal, etc.,
etc.  No, they are epic rather *because* they were a collective, and an
oral, endeavor [rather like gossip]. Epic has nothing inherent to do with
length, or with war, or with heroic virtue, or men.  Epic is what people
talk about.  Today's *epic*, in the USA at least, is the O.J. Simpson
thing.  The fact that this thing may be about sex and hollywood and money
and race, and the spilling of white blood apparently by some black hand, is
merely a reflection of what we talk about: it is epic.  Is this common
knowledge among you?

Where I come from it is traditional to distinguish between oral, or folk,
epic, on the one hand, and literary epic on the other.  In the strict sense
Virgil or Dante or Milton have merely produced literary *imitations* of
epic, rather than epic itself, at least in its ur-sense.... Where this puts
Ashbery, et al., I don't know, but I see no profit in confusing all of
these things into one category.... Are my questions of any use to you?

Apologies for being so late and irrelevant, but I've been busy reading
earnest student papers.

Best wishes,
George Thompson

Of course, the Iliad's audience until quite recently assumed that Homer was
an actual person who wrote  the text that we have based on historical
occurrences predating him by a generation or two. That audience derived its
notion of what constituted epic accordingly. The formulaic phrases in Homer
appear to be mnemonic devices, remnants of oral sources, not cliches.
Your definition of epic is certainly novel; I assume it's exclusive to you.
Or perhaps it's common knowledge where you come from.

The formulaic phrases in Homer *are* mnemonic devices; they are also
cliches [what is a cliche, after all?].  My definition of epic is shared
with the Greeks themselves.  The word "epos" itself simply means "word" [as
in the winged kind].  Consider the so-called "Homeric" hymns, or Hesiod.
Same meter, same genre.  Not always about "arms and the man"....  The very
fact that these "Homeric" hymns are attributed to *Homer* shows that "epic"
for the Greeks was rather different than it is for you. Look at the hymns
to Demeter, to Aphrodite, to Athena, etc.  These are, in the Greek sense,
just as "epic" as the Iliad....

And then there is the Vedic word, where I come from.

The monument is in Boston and depicts Colonel Shaw, the guy played by
Matthew Broderick or Tom Cruise or I forget who in the movie /Glory/,
opposite Denzel Washington. The others depicted, whom Lowell calls
"bell-cheeked Negroes" in the poem, are soldiers in the first black Union
regiment to serve in the Civil War. If I understand it correctly, the
regiment was subsequently wiped out in a huge battle. Anyway, if you look
at the statue, you notice immediately that Col. Shaw is depicted in /much/
higher relief and detail than the men under his command. I always took it
to mean that the monument "stuck in the city's throat" because, no matter
how effaced they were individually, it still memorialized black men.

George Thompson,
thanks for the Goethe quote.  As far as epic, I think what I said about
what distinguishes epic is that it is by/for/about the group agrees with
what you wrote.  But I think epic has also been a literary, written
genre, BEGINNING with Homer (in the "west" at least).  The Homer we
start from - in written epics, I mean - is a real composition (both
Iliad & Odyssey).  I'm not a classicist & let's not start an argument
about "Homer" as individual!  But they're written poems.  & I'm 3
ineffable individuals. The idea that Virgil & Milton are imitation
epics is interesting (since they don't have the same direct roots in
oral epic).  But Homer - Ill & Odd - as we know them - are poems!
Or I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

Can you tell us more about the Vedic word?

So you're saying the West lives in the shadow of an academicization of
an imitation (Virgil).  & among the Greeks "the word" (epos) permeated
culture in a way that "the word" does today (the media, the news).

Classicism is revolution.

I think poetry is the voice of a human person expressing some integrated
(or dis/integrated, same thing) meaning.  You can't escape meaning, and
voice is the means of making it vivid, poetic, creating wonder.  There
is a critical/philosophical debate here that poets can get into & (I)
shouldn't oversimplify, but it also seems to get awfully abstruse.
Speaking as a pre-Socratic, wholeness includes partiality and non-

especially.

Yeah, but Henry, aren't some people allergic to wheat? I don't see what all

"voice" is as a synonym for "chops," as in jazz, not lamb. Which doesn't

I'm sure these stats are all over the place by
now, but...ran across an article in a (dreadful)
local newspaper this morning, with the ironic
headline "affirmative action". I'll just give you
the end & the beginning--the rest, as you might
imagine, is the usual journalistic tripe, giving
"fair representation" to "experts" on both sides
without actually discussing the central issue,
except to negate it. anyway, it begins:

"The number of blacks admitted to the University
of California's Boalt Hall law school tumbled 81%
in the first year without affirmative action, and
Hispanic admissions fell 50%."

& ends:

"The Boalt dean said that instead of race, the law
school took into account any obstacles the applicants
had to overcome."

doesn't have much, I guess, to do with poetry--
but then again it probably has a hell of a lot to
do with it, too.

There is always artifice--I think, after reading a number of posts,
this is how I'll think  about"voice"--as artifice.  One's voice in a
poem (if one has only one voice) is equally self-serving and
self-defeating IF one's goal is "authenticity."  I believe!  (And
doesn't an exclamation point do WONDERS for the voice?)  Poet X, or the
so-called workshop poem, the "McPoem," as Donald Hall calls it in
Poetry and Ambition, is a great target--but everybody is hurling
stuff at it as if it were truly monolithic.  Is it?  I mean if you
avoid certain journals and national publications, you can pretty much
refuse to engage . . . though I don't know if that is politically or
emotionally healthy.  Was just reading difficult passage of Rilke about
submission being better than resistance because you still get to
partake in Power.   On the other hand, as a young
poet trying to get stuff published in journals,  I resent the prevalence
of a certain sort of taste exhibited by
many journal editors for those flat "lyrics," though so often the
song is missing.   (There's nothing like rejection--that is, if
you're looking to refine your ars poetica.)

Are you saying that this (the monument's capacity to gall the throat) is
indicative of _Lowell's_ attitude?  I will assume not--despite your lumping
this interpretation together with the "damning" "bell-cheeked Negro
infantry", or the "suspect" monument-- because this would be a serious
misreading of the poem.

Even if it was true that Shaw was represented in higher relief than his
regiment in the Shaw memorial, putting it in quite this way is
deeply polemical.  If the difference IS an expression of racism
(rather than
an expression of the fact that Shaw is sitting on a horse that is also
rendered in relief and so, if you will pardon the technical jargon,
sticks out further; or an expression of the fact that he commanded the
regiment-- both of which facts certainly have to DO with racism, but
then so did the Civil War, and on the whole perhaps we can agree that the
Union side was more progressive in these matters) , it would much more
likely be that of
Augustus Saint-Gaudens who designed the monument-- dedicated in 1897.

_Lowell_, who was, by the way, related to Shaw, took for his epigraph the
inscription on the monument (Relinquit Omnia Servare Publicam), changing,
however, "relinquit" to "relinquunt"-- "He leaves all things to serve the
Republic" became "They leave all things to serve the Republic"-- an act
of commemoration that would have been particularly pointed in 1960. This is
a poem AGAINST the city and its "attitudes"(parts of the city in any case--
the parts responsible for undermining the Boston Commons to build a parking
garage, for replacing
civic values with commercial ones-- in Lowell's Brahmmin lexicon this
meant the Irish). And, by the way, this is a poem rather sophisticated in
its understaning of the connections between the commercial appropriation
of significant images and the prosecution of modern
wars (in which Lowell refused to serve):

There are no statues for the lst war here;
on Boylston Street, a commercial photograph
shows Hiroshima boiling

over a Mosler Safe, the "Rock of Ages"
that survived the blast.


The point of all of this is not special pleading on Lowell's behalf.  It
simply irks me that it is possible to slang whatever "mainstream" poet--
because he uses "I", I suppose, because he is invested in "voice"-- with
whatever other objectionable attitude seems most objectionable, and no one
will particularly CARE if it is right or not-- as though there was
nothing to learn from Lowell because he is well-- Lowell. There is no
shortage of
complexity in attitudes and beliefs-- and granting a bit of nuance to Lowell
will not reduce the stockpile for the rest of us.

Best,
O.

meaning is rather a compulsive act of charity bestowed by an audient (not
the same thing (and it is probably this not-sameness that is poetry
(voice is just another way of saying oops)))

As someone who has spent much time observing and appreciating this monument
I must say that as much as I don't care for Lowell's poetry in general,
this particular poem is quite an exception. The relief of the sculpture is
very high. You can reach deeply into it, past the Colonel on his horse and
behind him, several inches past the marching reginment (three men deep).

Shaw's sword once protruded out independently from the sculpture, a very
real blade, pointing to the ground. It has been gone for many years (turned
to a ploughshare?).

It is remarkable that the soldiers are depicted at all--that the monument
is dedicated to the regiment, and not just to the commander. That Shaw is
so prominent speaks to many things: he was the commander, he was white, he
was symbolic of "progressive" Bostonians' attitude toward the war. i.e.,
white folks leading blacks out of slavery.

Fishbone or no, it is not nearly as bad and embarrassing as another Boston
monument a half mile away toward the South End, in which a seven or eight
foot tall Lincoln stands above kneeling and cowering newly-freed slaves,
Lincoln's right hand over them, Christ-like.

I pass by the Shaw monument quite a bit. Usually, in all seasons, it is
strewn with flowers

Mr Mann's account of this jibes with an Adorno-bit I saw last night: that
art is the remainder (the residue? which would tie it in with something
Carolyn Forche said about the trace?) after the problem in the work has
been solved. I know the meaning of certain writers' work became clearer
after I heard them read -- Bruce Andrews, David Shapiro and Juliana Spahr
are three I can think of right away. This is heading away from "voice"
perhaps and towards "biography" "personality" "social (con)text" etc. That
is, to what extent does "the meaning became clearer" in that sentence
really mean "I became persuaded of the necessity of several tiny personal
misunderstandings for my continued reception of the work of these people."

Actually I have no idea what Adorno means by solving problems in artwork.
I like encryption as much as the next decaying system, but the problem
much more often seems to do with my own capabilities not as a decoder ring
but as a sympathizer. This, Henry, is why I balk at your Mandelstam motto.
First of all, to say that 'classicism is revolution' in the context of a
revolutionary society is maybe too much of the pathos? That for that
context, Isaac Babel teaching his daughter to answer the phone "Daddy's
not here now" is maybe more to the point? Second, to appeal to
"classicism" is maybe only to say "the only code which is acceptable is a
preordained one" which never appeals to me when I think of writing as _not
only_ making new forms but as making _new meanings_. It's only from a
surveillance tower that it looks like nothing's new or it's all the same.

Maybe being a reader of this work ("this work") is being in the position
of learning how to manage the surplus?

I always wondered at those flowers--frequently roses, & often yellow,
as I recall, in 12-stem bunches or singly, among the mixed arrangmements.

The last year I was in Boston (last year), the monument was for
awhile again "propped by a plank splint", during the construction
of  the <italic>new</italic> parking garage under the Common--
or the refurbishment of the old, I'm not sure now.

The de-/segregation issue of the day was whether queer advocacy
groups could march in the St. Patrick's Day parade--we ended up with
one, the traditional one, in South Boston, & separate one in Cambridge.
<italic>"Reliquunt Omnia Servare Rem Publicam"</italic>.

I wonder if Shaw is still thus propped up?

Recall this only too vaguely, but Michelle Cliff deals with the arguments
over Saint-Gauden's various designs for the monument in _Free Enterprise_.
 I _think_ it ran along these lines: that originally he "hired" unemployed
black Civil War vets to pose for the statue, thereby insuring a higher
degree of authenticity -- they were also featured in a more prominent  way
in the design - but the statue's backers nixed this idea and the final
design relied on generic blacks - i.e. not taken from actual models.
 Cliff's book is fascinating for the way it deals with the relationship
between the past and the designs used to commemorate the past, esp., as they
bear on racism and the fate of the disenfranchised.

Even if it was true that Shaw was represented in higher relief than his
regiment in the Shaw memorial, putting it in quite this way is
deeply polemical.  If the difference IS an expression of racism
(rather than
an expression of the fact that Shaw is sitting on a horse that is also
rendered in relief and so, if you will pardon the technical jargon,
sticks out further; or an expression of the fact that he commanded the
regiment-- both of which facts certainly have to DO with racism, but
then so did the Civil War, and on the whole perhaps we can agree that the
Union side was more progressive in these matters) , it would much more
likely be that of
Augustus Saint-Gaudens who designed the monument-- dedicated in 1897.

While George Thompson's summary of Milman Parry's theories regarding
epic is accurate, it's a bit dated. In any case, certainly not, as
presented, "fact". Norman Austin, I think, pretty much dealt with it
in _Archery at the Dark of the Moon_.

Ron, I don't think my ideas around this are complex enough to be
"fascinating."  My point was simply that to challenge the notion that
writers of non-voice or language-centered (though I don't like that term)
work, through their moral superiority, somehow evade various issues in the
reader/writer relationship.  This is vague, so allow me to meander into
specifics.  Actually, I try to keep things vague for myself to allow an
intuitive reforming in my writing, I find that a mushy mind is much more
useful to me than a sharp mind, as far as my writing goes.  However, I've
been teaching, and you have to come up with *something* to say to them, so
I have been formulating some stuff that I've avoided formulating in the
past.

This last semester I took over the 2nd 8 weeks of a Comp A course for art
students.  Most of these students had turned to art in the first place
because of a deep distrust and dislike of language.  Three out of 14 were
dysflexic, and many of the others wrote at what seemed to me a junior high
school level (though they were all quite bright and articulate).  They were
there because they were forced to be there, most of them (thank god for me)
were juniors and seniors, even though this was supposed to be a freshman
course, because they'd avoided the course as long as possible.  I sat in on
a few classes the first 8 weeks, where the instructor lead them through
listless discussions about things like "does journalism tell the truth,"
and presented writing in terms of logos, ethos, and pathos--the Greek, I
supppose, communicating that Comp A was serious business.  Anyway, walking
into this dreadful situation I felt brave as Michelle Pfieffer in Dangerous
Minds.  And then there were the moral issues of teaching comp when I'd
spent years trying to transcend linearity . . .

So, I decided that the first thing I would teach them is that "whether or
not writing tells the truth" is an inappropriate way to look at things.  We
spent lots of time examining how all writing is artiface, a construct--even
looked as interviews as a literary form rather than transcribed speech.  I
particularly wanted them to get out of the rut of believing they were
writing the truth of their lives/feelings.  I used the metaphor of
seduction as a way to measure the success of any given piece, that the
writer is involved in a seduction of the reader, and the success of a given
piece is simply how well it succeeds in that seduction--NOT WHETHER IT
TELLS THE TRUTH.  I brought in a Christie's catalogue and had them each
look through it and rip out the first picture that appealed to them--they
enjoyed this ripping up of the book a lot.  Then their assignment was to
write "what about this piece seduced you."  I was trying to get them to
interact with the image, to give opinions other than "I liked this because"
or "this sucks because."  We made a field trip to the Kara Walker exhibit
at SF MOMA (Walker's art, for those of you not familiar with it, deals with
racism through the use of violent sexual imagery--the class very much liked
that and many of them used it as an opportunity to put the word "fucking"
into their essays)--I had them write about the exhibit and going to it, and
the fact that it was hung in a museum, in terms of the specificity of
viewing the work on that day, in that context, and how that impinged upon
their take on the work.  Obviously, this was about getting them beyond this
once and for all time, godlike, disembodied perception of the work.

John Yau's essay in _The Poetics of Criticism_ was a big hit, by the way.
John is able to make accessible some very basic, important things.  The
rebellious tone of the piece appealed to the students.  We also spent some
time reading essays by Diane Arbus.  One passage that we read has stuck
with me:

"Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out
looking another way and that's what people observe.  You see someone on the
street and essentially what you notice about them is the flaw.  It's just
extraordinary that we should have been given these peculiarities.  And, not
content with what we were given, we create a whole other set.  Our whole
guise is like giving a sign to the world to think of us in a certain way
but there's a point between what you want people to know about you and what
you can't help people knowing about you.  And that has to do with what I've
always called the gap between intention and effect."

So, back to the notion of writing as a seduction.  One of my pleasures of
reading is allowing myself to be seduced, to be thrilled, to abandon my
will to Edith Wharton, for instance.  I think the discomfort comes in when
I feel, not seduced, but manipulated--this is a fine line--when that gap
between intention and effect becomes too apparent and I feel ripped off.
Many of the criticisms of voice poetry "voiced" here were about how the
point of it is to make the "I" sound deep.  We're not really supposed to
share the epiphany, we're supposed to marvel at the epihaner.  But, I think
the non-I in many "language-centered" works is just as manipulative and
transparent.  Instead of an emotional epiphany we're lead to an
intellectual epiphany--and in the worst scenerio what we're really supposed
to marvel at is the smarts of the non-I who's generating this text.  The
non-I best seduces me when I don't see this massive frail ego behind it
begging for approval.  Not that begging for approval is a bad thing, it can
be done to great effect if you're upfront about it--in the work of the
artist Candy Ass, for instance.

So, you see, Ron, what I was saying is quite simple.

I'm glad Fernando invented us as antagonist/heteronyms.  This above connects
with what I've been reading about that ol revolutionary Aristotle's theory
of tragedy (via Michael Davis's fine book I mentioned before once). It's
always "mixed" - as an imitation of the action of a rational/animal, the
poem/tragedy means what it says/means something else; is real/artificial;
goes double, two-footed; tragedy is the piling up of "several tiny personal
misunderstandings"; so that the meaning is never final but always alive to
new discoveries.

 This, Henry, is why I balk at your Mandelstam motto.

I know what you're saying, I think.  It's just that the things George
Thompson was mentioning opened up the idea that what we always thought
was "old", classic, done, finished - has actually been misunderstood,
misrepresented, unheard - & actually has something new to offer, if we
look.  - Henry

p.s. regarding Chris Mann's idea - I never thought of the reader creating
meaning as an act of charity. (though some might feel that way about
reading my innumerable postings.)  I give the writer credit for organizing
a prior meaning which is presented, though I may not "get" it the same way.
But that's a different boring discussion.  Now about those potatoes...

        I'm getting a kick out of George Thompson's linking of cliche and epic.

        There's ever a bizarre humor at work in "poetic justice" . . .

        Baudelaire wrote that he aspired to the writing of cliches.
(Unfortunately for him, the only cliche to emerge from his work is
"Benjamin's Baudelaire". Appropriation & all, you know--)

        Flaubert as well had a fascination with cliches:  Bouvard et
Pecuchet bear witness.

        And isn't Don Quixote about the "epic struggle" WITH cliches?

        "Tilting at windmills" and all--

        In Jim Thompson's books The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1280 you'll
find the cliche used as a means for trying to cope with killing. " Boring
people to death" with cliches seems almost as fun to Deputy Sheriff Lou
Ford (in The Killer) as out right killing them--almost, but not quite.

        Jack Kerouac wrote in "The Vanishing American Hobo" that the Law
operates with one line of justice and nine of boredom . . .

        Is that an "epic" "measure" for "poetic justice"?

There's a realtively new, slender book by Amy Gutman and Kwame Anthony
Appiah (sorry I don't have the title -- the book and I are in different
states) in which Gutman provides a straightforward and commonsensical
critique of the logic that denies the relevance of race in admissions etc
but allows "other" disabilities such as income -- Her questions are so
clear that you can't help imagining Ward Connerly and Pete Wilson trying
to answer them --

We've already seen editorials in California in response to these
statistics claiming that they constitute "proof" that unqualified blacks
and Hispanics were bsing admitted previously -- however, none of these
editorials cites the actual admission standards employed (that is, at most
law schools of this quality, huge numbers of "qualified" applicants are
turned away each year -- the argument is really about who aming those
meeting the entry-level requirements will actually enter)

"aming" equals "among" etc -- you can tell from the errors in my posts
that I am back at that uncorrectable system in Boulder

p.s.: re: epic in "Vedic" sense, per George Thompson [an Indologist who
surely knows a lot more than he's letting on in that regard, so far] --

the two grand "epics" [under what equivalent-ish rubirc, I'm not sure] of
India [but not Vedic, in the sense not part of the Vedas, though
chronicling events that prob. were concurrent w/ Vedic epoch more or
less] are, of course, the Mahabharata (attributed to a chap named Vyasa)
and the Ramayana (attributed to a bloke called Valmiki) --

the "Valmiki" and the "Vyasa" of these 2 epics
sure seem to be presented as individual writers
much in the way that Homer is so (re)presented . . .

I'm sure there's been critique of that traditional assumption
along lines akin to the critique(s) of "Homer" as being Homer --

I tend to like the idea of a "real" Valmiki & a "real" Vyasa,
though lord knows those vast oral epics must've rolled along
for many many generations, so there are some arguments in
favor of the other side o' the teeter-totter . . .

the issue of authorship of the Sanskrit "Valmiki" Ramayana anyway
contrasts w/ the more recent vernacular versions in India --

the 2 main ones (so far as I know) being the medieval Hindi version
written (very creatigely) by Tuilsidas (certainly a biographical individual,
far as I've ever heard) and a So. Indian version (Tamil, I think) by
someone called Kamban

(my info more or less comes from C. Rajagopalachari's popular

that's a very quick sketch of "epic" field anent India, tho

This reminds me of one of my favorite short stories, Flannery O'Connor's

In fact, isn't "random violence" a cliche? Was it Blake, in one of the

I was wondering if we were ever going to get back to sports. I just heard
that the NBA is threatening to suspend Shawn Kemp for tomorrow's game as
well. One of the pleasures of the NBA Playoffs so far (as I think George
Bowering noted in an earlier post) is that the remaining teams are so old!
Malone, Stockton -- Perkins, Cummings -- Barkley, Drexler -- Ewing, the
Williamses -- the Bulls even have Robert Parish on their roster, the only
player in the league as old as I am. The Playoff game most embedded in my
memory (and, thus, a minor cliche) is the deciding game of the Knicks/
Lakers final (1972?) when the crippled Willis Reed hit two jump shots at
the beginning of the game and "inspired" (the spirit of the god came into
him) his team to victory, thus breaking my emerging West Coast heart.
I don't see anyone around -- least of all Jordan -- who could have a
similar effect today.

Apologies for the long post: Dodie's just before this one was terrific!
What ARE people talking about, anyway? Would it be possible to write an
epic about the NBA Playoffs? About "The Odyssey"? Thanks, Dave . . .

I'm talking about a friendly theory of reading work written in response
to/under the influence of theory (i.e. the conscious use of non-conforming
ideas/practices/subjects). When I am comfortable enough with this theory I
will be able to use it to explain in a non-passionate way not only why I
like what I like but how others who don't like it might look favorably
upon it.

Of course if you piss me off, I'll just go the ordinary passionate route.

Your examples and specifics regarding how you dealt with these problems as a
teacher and in your own writing were excellent. Teaching language as
artifice and seduction is an interesting way to get young students involved
in thinking about writing as something other than the search for truth.

Do you or anybody out there have specific examples of what you mention above

So many good posts in the last week I keep wishing I had time to do more
than glance

It seem to me (at least) 3 ideas of voice are being talked about:

voice as vibrations in air emitted by individuals, esp. when reading their
own writing to audiences (this one often used some what ironically, played
off the second meaing

voice as something that was, in an early post, defined as a commonly held
(in certain, Highly Suspect quarters) definition without much substance:
voice as the thing writers are told by other writers to "look for" and
"look forward to"; it is supposed to be a individual's creation, either the
conglomeration of many little peculiarities of her or his Style (word
choice, averaged over time?) or possibly something more mystical: a click
of some psycic combination which once found enables the writer to be
consistently better than they were, a confidence

some of the discussion about voice has been tempered (temper added?) by
another "definition" of voice that I think has gone mostly unrecognized
but, like an unseen planet, still exerts its pull: that is voice as viewed
from "outside" the author's attention or disregard; voice as seen from
elsewhere: voiceless as anyone might try to be--making very real attempts
in their writing to avoid habitual peculiarities, to avoid assuming
themselves in their work--to the very extent that they are social beings
their social constructed worlds will always be different from all other
socially constructed worlds (each person the center of their own net of
occurences) and so there is still that unavoidable voice, a peculiarity of
social environment

Instead of cliches, epics might better be said to contain commonplaces.
Cliches come with more ironic quotation marks than commonplaces. Cliches
tend to sound like the first thing off the tongue, commonplaces like
something gotten to through careful work--I'm not making a value judgement
here--fast & flippant is good to, and the first thing off the tongue (when
not a cliche) is also wit (Tristin Tzara being perhaps a consummate
practicioner of witty cliche)

To read Lowell's attitude to that frieze as racist in a direct, individual
way is a mistake; if there is racism in that poem it is very guarded and
examined at once

Boston's continued "undermining" of that part of the common is I'm sure a
sort of grand Happening (reminiscent of fluxus) by which they pretend to
forever bring Cal's poem to life; walking past that monument, at least, I'd
always look down at the construction and say I *AM* Robert Lowell

Substitute "individually and socially" for "socially" and the construct is
more inclusive and no less accurate. Idiosycracies do exist, and it's harder
to know where the groove comes from than to construct a theory about the source.

Homer's repeated phrases are neither commonplaces nor cliches, they are
chosen (or prescribed by custom) mnemonic formulas. If differences of this
kind in the meaning of words are not recognized language loses much of its
value as a communicative tool.

Boston, which has long had one of North America's more uncomfortable driving
and parking environments, made matters more difficult for drivers by closing
off large parts of downtown to daytime traffic. This was a terrific idea,
but not terribly useful if all those cars had no alternative but to
overburden nearby areas. The city had a few choices: ban cars altogether
from downtown, to the extraordinary benefit of suburban mall owners; level
even larger areas of historic downtown than have already felt the ax to make
room for parking lots and garages, or go underground. Boston picked this
last choice; they did it well enough on the first go-round so that for those
not in the know it's hard to find the sub-commons garage entrance the first
time around. Nor do I remember anything being undermined, despite the mining
going on under it. And the commons has remained intact. I can't see how this
insults Shaw, the soldiers he commanded, or St.-Gaudens.

Or is this language-centered that metamorphosed into "voice"?  And won't
this happen to all surface denial of voice?  Time will say nothing
but I told you so.

To clarify--I didn't mean, by citing Lowell's description of the black
soldiers, to mean that HE was racist. I think I was trying, in a rather
fumbling way, to say something about the lack of individuation of the
soldier figures on the monument.

I can't forget the fellow prisoner in another Lowell poem who had
"curlicues of marijuana in his hair"--it's one of the CO poems and it
describes Lowell hanging out with proto-Rastas in jail.

I am pleased to announce that Amnesty International has now
produced a film on the genocide in Rwanda, "Forsaken Cries:
The Story of Rwanda."  The film was made by Kathy Austin,
Andrea Torrice and a team of others, is narrated by Danny
Glover, and provides an excellent overview of the conditions
that gave rise to the genocide, the reality of the genocide
in 1994, and its aftermath. It was made by a humanrights
organization, and so is concerned with how we address the
problem of genocide from a human rights point of view. There
are interviews with Alison des Forges, Richard Goldstone of
the International Criminal Court, and AI's Adotei Akwei.

It is a good film. It runs 30 minutes.

I was involved in getting this project off the ground--it
was long and difficult, and we have to thank Mort Winston,
chair of the Board of Directors of AIUSA, for his support

I imagine (although I actually have no idea) that Lowell was not opposed
to parking *per se*.  He was, however, opposed to graft-- especially
when he could point a finger at Irish politicians.  (Of course, one can't
really accuse Lowell of letting his own sort-- "Mayflower screwballs"--
off the hook entirely).

I am sort of amused, though, by the idea that the "problem" with "For the
Union
Dead" might be that Lowell is seeking injury where there is none; that
what he needs to realize is that there
was a *real* parking problem and that (come on Cal, everyone's tired of
your turmoil) the garage is really pretty hard to see.

Perhaps corruption downtown is preferable to the corruption borne
by the vector of the suburban mall. Or perhaps the interest of the poem
(should one decide that is has any) is not
precisely the extent to which it can be treated as a retrospective op-ed.

Best,
O.

Sorry, I've been away from my computer and there are many things that I
would like to respond to, but first things first.

My observations re Homer are not based on a summary of Milman Parry, but on
my own reading of Homer, and Hesiod, and the Homeric hymns, etc., and not
in some nice English translation like Fagle's.  If anything is "a bit
dated" it is Austin's demurrals against Parry's hardcore thesis, that
"Homer" was not attempting anything like what, say, Virgil was.  Parry's
work has been *far* more productive than Austin's.

Never mind cliches.  What are "mnemonic devices"?  In what sense are the
phrases "long-suffering Odysseus" or "swift-footed Achilles" or
"rosy-fingered Dawn" mnemonic?  In this sense: they are formulaic,
*predictable*, and therefore *easier to memorize* than Virgil's
carefully-thought-out alternatives [in Latin].  Homer's sense of "a
memorable phrase" is different from ours.

Never mind Milman Parry.  Greek "epos" means "word."  More specifically
"the traditional word." If you don't believe me, check out Gregory Nagy
[whom Austin has not "pretty much dealt with"].

Does anyone deny that the Homeric hymns to Aphrodite, Demeter, Athena, are
just as "epic" as the Iliad?  I did not need Milman Parry to see that these
too are epic in the Greek sense.  I just took the trouble to look for
myself.

As for the Vedic word, let me take my breath, and get back to you.

Best wishes [formulaic],

The concern about "voice' on the list recently is really a concern about
writing to meet expectations, get good grades, get approval, etc., vs.
writing to write or writing to find the self (the ancient sixties self-
expression or authenticity).  Unfortunately, "voice" can pin the tail
on either end - indicating either the futility of using language to find
reality or reality to find a language.  It's all in the effort, I think,
Dodie?

I think chops is a great way of looking at this voice thing.  A lot of
problems with the term "voice" is that it's too broad:  everyone's got a
voice.  What's at stake is the nervous desire to make each voice (your
voice) unique.  This may be a foolish desire, up there with wanting to be a
famous poet, but, like Dodie, I don't want my poems to look/sound like
anyone else's (especially all those hordes of other MFAs out there).
That's why I work on my chops.

"So, you see, Ron, what I was saying is quite simple."

Well, Dodie, that sentence certainly wins the Calculated Innocence of the
Week award. But, more seriously, yes I know Kara Walker's work and saw the
show at SF MOMA (tho I was more moved, frankly, by the Arneson chemo
sculptures in the next room, probably because I've been involved
intellectually/emotionally with Arneson's work for decades). I also had a
chance to hear Arthur Danto give a talk partly about her silhouettes in the
Whitney Biennial (which I've not seen) here at the Philadelphia Art Alliance
(a toney East Coast institution with a very expensive restaurant "Opus 251"
on its main floor, more akin to the Mechanics Institute Library, say, than
New Langton Arts) maybe 3 weeks ago.

A lot of what makes Walker's works, especially the ones that involve
disembowlment, lynching, rape, coprophilia, etc., so intense is that they're
presented in these very sentimental pseudo-folk art forms (in that sense,
not all that removed in spirit from the Jeff Koons Michael Jackson & Bubbles
sculpture that SFMOMA owns). Is that combination of sentiment/shock what you
mean by "seduction"? In some sense, they seem to reverse exactly the value
system of an Anselm Kiefer, who sentimentalizes the monumentality of Museum
Art and makes that the basis for his work.



"  We made a field trip to the Kara Walker exhibit at SF MOMA (Walker's art,
for those of you not familiar with it, deals with racism through the use of
violent sexual imagery--the class very much liked that and many of them used
it as an opportunity to put the word "fucking" into their essays)--I had
them write about the exhibit and going to it, and the fact that it was hung
in a museum, in terms of the specificity of viewing the work on that day, in
that context, and how that impinged upon their take on the work.  Obviously,
this was about getting them beyond this once and for all time, godlike,
disembodied perception of the work."

"So, back to the notion of writing as a seduction.  One of my pleasures of
reading is allowing myself to be seduced, to be thrilled, to abandon my
will to Edith Wharton, for instance.  I think the discomfort comes in when
I feel, not seduced, but manipulated--this is a fine line--when that gap
between intention and effect becomes too apparent and I feel ripped off.
Many of the criticisms of voice poetry "voiced" here were about how the
point of it is to make the "I" sound deep.  We're not really supposed to
share the epiphany, we're supposed to marvel at the epihaner.  But, I think
the non-I in many "language-centered" works is just as manipulative and
transparent.  Instead of an emotional epiphany we're lead to an
intellectual epiphany--and in the worst scenerio what we're really supposed
to marvel at is the smarts of the non-I who's generating this text.  The
non-I best seduces me when I don't see this massive frail ego behind it
begging for approval.  Not that begging for approval is a bad thing, it can
be done to great effect if you're upfront about it--in the work of the
artist Candy Ass, for instance."

I'm intrigued at what seems to be a test of Sincerity you're proposing here.
Not that your description of some langpo isn't accurate enough, but rather
the position from which you're making this description. If "abandonment" is
what you want (this sounds like the Swinburnean equivalent of Artaud or
something), rather than something more Brechtian, the "presence" of the
author (I or non-I) would seem to get in the way.

As for myself, I've begun reading Mason & Dixon and am probably lost to the
real world for the next 4 months....

Yes, I think that our conceptions of epic do match, more or less [and I
should add that I have enjoyed your postings about this]. I'm not so
mean-spirited or presumptuous as to deny the term "epic" to Milton or
Virgil, or to Ashbery for that matter if that becomes the consensus, say,
on this list.

It might be useful to talk of different types of epic: oral [or
folk],literary [or individual], private maybe [or "individual"].  When we
slide toward the private, idiosyncratic end of the scale this thing "epic"
turns into something else: I don't mind calling it lyric.  When we slide
toward the other end we verge on something else again: we could call it
rumor, gossip [Homer calls it "imperishable fame"] -- I myself find that
matters at this end of the scale are just as worthy of attention as the
stuff at the other end [maybe more so].

I don't mean to suggest that the difference betwen oral and literary epic
is a matter of formless flow of speech [strings of cliches, say], on the
one hand [i.e., oral], and "real composition" [literary, "poems"] on the
other.  The Ill and the Odd are "real compositions", no doubt [as are also
*any* folk epics from anywhere].  But they don't operate by the same rules
of composition as the Aeneid does. One of the interesting things about
current Homeric studies is the work that is being done on figuring out what
"Homer"'s rules of composition were.  In my own work I'm trying to do the
same for Vedic, whose rules are far more deeply hidden from us than
"Homer"'s are.

Sorry, got to go now.

Thanks for crystallizing this so well. I would add that in the case of the
'epiphaner' it is also his/her smarts we are to marvel at, in so far as how
successfully the tried and true epiphanic maneuver is executed, which
strikes me as a kind of ironic concession to the fact we've seen it before.

Very young children also like others to marvel at their successfully
doo-dooing in prescribed locations. The difference is that, with children,
this achievement eventually becomes less and less interesting.

Yes, that's "Memories of West Street and Lepke," one of my favorites.
Lowell, it seems to me, never quite stands still for the caricature we
often want to draw of him, big, famous and "traditional/formal" New
England poet.  There are certainly better straw men to place in that role
than Lowell and I think he takes the fall most often primarily as backlash
for all the attention he got. Certainly from the '57 or so on he's paying
pretty close attention to Ginsberg's work, O'Hara's too I think.  The one
time I met Ginsberg we got into a conversation about Lowell and he pretty
much praised Lowell as a guy and the late work.  Duncan too is fairly
complementary of Lowell's poetry in his book of essays *Fictive
Certainties*.  I see Lowell as a kind of Norman Mailer-style in-between
figure (in his own way of course) with all of the problems that go along
with that stance, but quite different than, say, Richard Wilbur, and not
at all a precursor to New Formalism and such.  He's not my favorite by any
means but I still get alot out of reading selected things from *Life
Studies* to the end.

I wasn't suggesting by seduction that you enter into a sentimentalized
relationship with The Work.  More basically that you buy into what The Work
is supposed to be doing (and what is the work Supposed to Be Doing, many a
theory book covers that, like Susan Steward's *On Longing* which I'm
(re)reading now, her discussion of the different relationships between
reader and text in allegory vs. realist fiction, that kind of thing).
Actually, Walker's work didn't seduce *all* my students.  I enjoyed the one
paper by the guy who ragged on how she couldn't draw and how it was obvious
the reason she turned to silhouettes was they didn't involve detail.  The
guy who wrote this is very good at detail himself--I went to a one-night
show of his where he did these American flag/female genital drawings that
were awesome in their detail, even though I wasn't very comfortable with
them.

No, Ron, you've got me wrong there.  I'm not proposing Sincerity here.
Sincerity is always a tone, not a state of being for me.  That's one of the
first things I told those kids, who at first would be so Sincere in their
writing that they wouldn't want anybody else to read it, I'd say,
"Sincerity is not about exposing the writer's soul, sincerity is a tone, an
effect."  The presence of the author, to me, would only make the experience
of "abandonment" more sexy.

Ron, I thought of an example.  A while back I bought this Routledge book by
two women, I can't remember their names, about Modernist women artists and
writers.  It sounded interesting, especially since I hadn't read/thought
about Nathalie Barney, Romaine Brooks, Renee Vivien since like the 70s, and
I was wondering what my reactions to them would be as an Adult.  It was
obvious that the writers were very sincere feminists and sincere
intellectuals but their book was a total flop, in my opinion, in its
seduction value.  As I'm sure, you'll agree, Ron, a well-constructed theory
book can be most thrilling.  The problem with the book (aside from the fact
that the writers didn't seem to have any ideas) was the clumsy use they
made of theory buzz words.  For instance, when they were talking about
Brook's and Barney's tendency to adopt the clothing of male dandies, the
writers would consistently refer to this as their "sartorial strategies."
After a while the point of the chapter seemed really to be how many
different ways they could work in their buzz-baby "sartorial strategies."
Not that one should never write "sartorial strategies," but in some cases,
"cross dressing," a term which seemed to scare them, would have been less
awkward.  The writers, to me, seemed pretentious, but more than that to be
terribly insecure, lacking confidence in what they were saying.  If they
were less sincere, more into creating effects, I think the book might have
worked better.

As I read the above chapter, I was thinking of Terry Castle, who's so much
fun to read, and whose playfulness is quite sexy, I was thinking Terry
Castle, if she were writing about this, and it does sound like something
she'd write about, Terry Castle would know when to use "cross dressing,"
when to use "sartorial strategies."  One of the pleasures of reading Castle
is that she gives the impression that she knows exactly what she's going
for and how to get it.  Her sincerity isn't something that comes up for me.

I write from an (extremely) partial sense of the thread so far, but:

1.
I can't think of a poet whose work I did not begin to understand (to
'hear') much better once I heard that poet read.

Once I heard that poet's voice.

That's not a point of theory, of course. It's not even really a fact, and
certainly not a piece of data; but, it's a true report of experience.

"Voice" is just a metonym for identity, and no matter how we work athwart
or push off from that concept, all action and certainly all language
depends on identity.

That doesn't mean we can't read Dante, only that it would be neat to hear
him read. If you're interested in Spicer and I tell you I have a tape of
him reading "Language" -- do you want to hear it? I think so!

It's only worked the other way that a problem occurs. That is, when we
begin with the concept of voice, as if it really did have a theoretical
existence.

2.
We also use the word to mean "effective expression" -- as in "to give voice
to an idea."

Here too it's a metonymic turn of language; it derives from the physical
voice, from singing, the production of tone.

But metaphorical too. Tho the term "voice" was anathema to poets of my
generation in our early years, we used and learned from other terms with
the same metaphorical basis -- "sound" for example as in "sounding the world."

The intellectual content on the other hand is very different. The idea that
a poem "sounds" the world the way a mallet sounds a gong, this is a way to
give objectivity, status in the world, to the poem, and remove it from
being a simple expression of a person. So, it rhymes poem and world rather
than poem and person.

Reasons for doing this had nothing to do with the word "voice," as if poets
were logicians and making points about the validity of terms and usage.
They had to do with the poets we felt opposed to and *their use of* the
term voice, i.e. with the fact that they *owned* the term.

Anyway time passes and you learn to think about things differently. I well
remember a short poem by Ron Padgett whose point was the complete lack of
connection between love and death (it's in Great Balls of Fire, his first
book, the book of a poet in his twenties). I understood and understand the
effectiveness of his poem. It was a useful poem for me to read in the time
of my life that I read it, useful in the sense that this word is the
highest praise you can give a poem sometimes. The poem does something in
your life.

But you can't live a life without seeing the connection between love and
death, not now for sure and not ever.

Voice. Poem sounds and resounds. But poems are fragile too, and can be
silenced, as sometimes one voice silences another voice. A loud voice,
certain of what it is saying, speaking a truth, may silence another voice
more tentative less certain speaking a different truth. But a silenced
voice may also go on speaking, and in the end it may be the voice we want
to hear.

I want to chime in here to note that, as far as I know, cliche is a
typesetter's term--i.e. having to do with certain clusters of words which
occurred often enough together that a piece of type could be made to cover
the group of words instead of using the individual plates separately
(requiring fewer physical gestures on the part of the typesetter to rach
for type--important given that many were in fact illiterate).  Thus, our
*ideolgical* notion of cliche is very much determined by a technology
that's part of the early modern period and after.  The formulaic phrases
(as above) may not be mnemonic, but formulaic in terms of the meter
itself--memorable in the sense of predetermined phomemic spaces employed to
help propel the narrative, but not, I think, in terms of "cliche" or
prepackaged ideas at least in the way we understand that signifying process
of the cliche.

Awhile back Mike Boughn offered the idea that epic was a distinctive way of
thinking, & I said no, wanting to keep thought out of it & just look at
the "aesthetic" boundaries (narrative, group vs. individual, all that).
But have had 2nd thoughts all along - what maybe links Olson, LZ, Pound
most closely to the ancient epics is the thinking-scope of them - the Ill
& the Odd are really about the place, character, fate of "man" in world
of Gods & chance - these 20th cent poems aim for the "whole thing" -
thinking through the whole thing in one "poetic action" - not meditative
or lyric chips off the block -
but what you're starting to get at, George, is "compositional methods" -
a closer look at which might address the purpose of them, the end-meaning -
or goal of composition, if there is "one" -
- there are a few buffalos in Providence, I should point out - HG

A friend, Deborah Meadows, has written a contemporary verse
adaptation of a section of the Shahnama, a 10th/11th century
Persian epic by Firdausi.  The section is called "Zahak the
Dragon King" & her adaptation is about 40 pp long.  She's
taught it in college classes & finds it specially appealing
as an ancient tale of political resistance.  She asked me
what presses might be interested in such a piece.  At a loss,
& at the risk of chafing this list's ever-chafed boundaries,
I pose the question here:  any suggestions appreciated.
I've read the piece - a wondrous tale w/ crisp philosophic
asides, rendered clear & at moments funny in Debbi's verse.

cliche certainly derives from a printing term, but I don't think it was ever
used in Jocelyn's sense. What the French called a cliche was called a
stereotype plate in English. My understanding is that it was a mold--usually
of a whole page of type or an engraving--that was used to print from instead
of the original.

This may be correct--I don't have my appropriate reference stuff with me;
however, the point I am making at the moment is that we cannot apply to
oral or scribal epic the anachronistic term of cliche in either its
(literal) or ideological sense as it is used in our current critical
currency; as I am not a classicist, I am not familiar with whether or not
there is an analogous term which is more apporpriate to discussing Greek
epic in its context(s).  But my point is that the very term cliche--as a
mold let's say from which one makes the multiple copies instead of the
original--is a technology, like all technologies,  that contours cultural
notions of "original" "reproduction" etc. how each is valued, etc.  Since,
in our post Romantic ethos, "we" value "originality" (i.e the true
sentiment and all that "voice" stuff) and decry the copy, cliche as the
technology which facilitated the making of the copies has, over time,
become a term which now exceeds its technical or instrumental origin and is
used almost completely in an ideological, critical, discoursive manner etc.
and perhaps more relvent for this discussion, as if its contemporary
meaning as a prepackaged phrase, idea, set of relationships has always
existed as such--as a kind of transhistorical phenomenon--which gets us
into trouble when we're applying to contexts in which, so far as I know, it
didn't exist either as a term or ideology.

Agreed (I was riding my precision-in-language hobbyhorse, which just won the
Preakness)
Small caveat--the valuing of originality of expression goes back far beyond
the romantics (tho not as far as Homer).

Yes, of course "originality" was a desirable commodity--economically,
discoursively, aesthetically--prior to the Romantics--inscribed and imbued
by various fantasies of social cohesion, mobility, blah, blah; i.e. Old
Ben's construction of his ms after the publishing syndicte's First Folio
and all that--and even farther back into coterie and court culture, etc.
It just seems to me that after all the interiorizing subjectivitzing of the
(canonical male)  Romantics and the ensuing discoursive codification of
that as "natural" (via the New Critics and the like)--, it's important to
specify the historical and constructed nature of "originality" as well as
to understand it in its plurity of historical, economical, genered, racial
contexts (standard New Historical line, I know)...

i'm aware this isn't really the focus of the discussion, but i identify
strongly with this. There are poets of course we (especially from New
Zealand) will/have never got/get to hear, but (for example)  i certainly
found listening to Lyn H when she was here a few years ago - provided a
whole lot of strategies for rereading her. Not necessarily in a meaning
sense although i can't deny that her presentation of her words did change
the experiences of meaning i found in her works, but particularly in a
visceral (or musical) sense.

Subject:      dirty postmodernism

I just re-subscribed and happy to come back. Let's see...I feel I
should contribute some kind of snippet, so here goes: I heard from a
friend that Paul Hoover's book (the editor of the humoungous (sp?)
Norton _Postmodern American Poetry_), had been selected by none
other than Marvin Bell, most recently author of the very depressing
series "Poems of the Dead Man," and director, I think, of the Iowa
Writer's Workshop, for the "coveted" National Poetry Series!

I was wondering: Is this cause for rejoicing, embarrassment, second-
thoughts, or factional reconciliation? Certainly, Mr. Hoover's
authority as an arbiter of "Postmodernism" (insofar as he gladly
accepts Mr. Bell's approval) might be called into question?

I was, in part, wondering, because I heard from a third party that
when Mr. Hoover was in Iowa City a couple months ago, he talked shit
at the bar to Creative Writing students about my friend (and
significantly greater poet than he) Forrest Gander, who was visiting
poet at the time there. Is it possible, I wonder, that Mr. Hoover's
little visit to Iowa City could have had something to do with his
little prize? (I would like to say here that if Forrest knew I was
writing this, he would be extremely pissed, and he will certainly be
when he finds out, but I can't contain myself...).

anyway, it's good to be back. I've missed the great people on this
list! Even Bromige and Bowering, who write code behind everybody's
back.

To be contentious about it, I'm not surprised at all that an estabnik
like Marvin Bell might want to publish poetry by the editor of an
anthology as incompletely representative of contemporary craft-extending
work as the Norton anthology of "postmodern" poetry.  I DO value the
Hoover anthology, and am pleased with the recognition it has brought to
many previously over-looked poets of excellence, but it's no *Firebird*
to Bell's *Swan Lake*.                  --Bob G.

Kent, I think it's bloody little related to post, pre, or any other kind
of modernism--I think that the whole Iowa mafia is an extremely sticky
crew, little given to observing niceties of ethics. Jorie Graham is well
known for never accepting a gig unless there's something in it for hubby
James Galvin too; she is also notorious for "coincidentally" selecting
Iowa-student work for every major prize she's been asked to judge. (The
most recent such prize was given by an organization whose head is another
Iowa graduate. Hmmm.) My suggestion would be dispatching an immediate
squadron of Rinzai monks with well-oiled kyosakus and piercing yells.
Maybe they could awaken justice, no pun intended, of course.

It's great when a new mind (a new voice?) joins an online community;
suddenly you hear another sound, and what thoughts you heard thought are
displaced and changed in value. So George Thompson.

Whatever the provenance of the word "cliche" it is used to mean "a received
idea pithily expressed." Truth is not at question in a cliche -- hey, 2 and
2 = 4, right?  -- nor is truth being concluded. A template of truth is
being used to tell you how to view a given situation.

Of course, it's also possible to use cliches ironically. For my money, this
is one of the two or three most overused devices in contemporary poetry of
the mainstream (whatever that is).

If the I in a poem is to be set apart (and it always is in some degree),
irony is the weakest device to this end, as it lets that I out of things
and their consequences at very little cost. And, often, that scot-clean
irony merely sets the stage for a lyric outburst in which the I reinserts
itself and the *you* of the poem (i.e. the reader) is meant to marvel and
experience an epiphany.

In fairness, there's a lot of use of this basic schema in poetry on *our*
side of the fence where, oddly, the grass is greener (had you noticed?)
(I'm imitating what annoys me, sorry). Especially, I find, by those whose
clay feet have been planted long on the academic road. Of course, that's
just me and my prejudices at work.

In any case, cliche has nothing to do with epic.

If I'm right, the formulaic sections of an oral composition are there to
allow the reciter/teller time to think of what comes next and formulate it.
That "what comes next" may also be partly formulaic, inasmuch as the demand
for "what's next" only ceases with the poem's sound. I.e., formally, these
are compositional aids.

When oral devices appear on a printed page, they become very different, how
could they not? The Iliad *is* a written work -- it only *was* an oral
work. As we read the Iliad, sitting alone in a chair in a pool of lamplight
or halted interminably at a red light, jaw dropped, and the traffic an
angry snarl of unnoticed horns and shaking fists, take your choice (more
imitative irony, and again I'm sorry).

That which has been formulated, that which still must be formulated and
quickly, that's the essential situation of the oral poet (a useful template
for much of life, yes?).

On the page, the devices that register this situation are foregrounded and
static; as such, they become available for use to entirely different ends.

Subject:      Re: voice, and

I'm still catching up from a week in California & lots of desk work
on my return.  I'll start a new administrative job in a few days, and
next week I'll be in federal court for an interesting lawsuit.  But I
do want to try to respond to several Poetics postings of the past
couple of weeks.  On advertisements, book listings, and readings:
please do continue these.  Such listings help me get a feel for who
is reading where & what's being published, particularly by folks
associated with this list.  In fact, this list, from chatty to
profound, is one of the most important sources I have for thinking
about poetry.  Thanks to all!

Several of you have asked me to post my Anti-Wonder/Wonder conference
talk.  The talk itself is still in rough shape.  I'll outline what
I'm working on because these writing projects touch on the developing
topic of voice.  I had written a new ten pages of material which I
thought would be part one of the talk.  This portion treats in some
detail what I think of as the rhetoric of wonder:  begins with a
generic wonder-moment in Kerouac's _On the Road_, then moves on to
look at what others on the list are criticizing as a kind of voice
poem (a topic that I trace via Robert Pinksy's 1976 _Situation of
Poetry_ and Charlie Altieri's 1984 _Self and Sensibility..._).  but,
as others on the list (Ron? Dodie?) have begun to point out, the anti-
voice (or anti-wonder, or anti-epiphany) poems has its own
conventions, its own liabilities, its own pretensions.  I plan to
develop examples and discussions.  That is, I'll shoot fish in at
least two opposing or apposing barrels.  That part of Part One is
unfinished.

Part two (which I did not read at Stanford due to time constraints)
involves a few pages from an essay on Myth and Poetry.  I've recently
edited a section of a new journal, _Mythospheres_, due to begin in
1997 (Fall?).  I've begun to think about the writings of certain
poets who are often admired in innovative poetry circles, but whose
work, it seems to me, is in many ways antithetical to that innovative
work.  Specifically, I've begun to think seriously about the
shamanistic and mythic claims in Jerry Rothenberg's work, and the
high emotionalism in Jerry's work, and in Robert Duncan's.  I've
always had an ambivalent relationship to myth-based poetry, though
I've always greatly admired Duncan's work.  In the section I edited,
I've included an Introduction, and an essay and poems by Jack Foley,
Jake Berry, and me.  In my essay, I work through some of Duncan's
"Truth and Life of Myth" essay, trying to explain my allergies and
affinities, using Duncan's work as an occation to think about the
possible "censorship" (in innovative poetries) of a kind of myth-
based high romanticism (and high emotionalism).

I guess in all three parts of my intended Stanford talk, I'm trying
to think through what I feel as fissures _within_ language poetry or
within a broad range of innovative poetries.  Specifically, I'm
trying to think about the place of spirituality, emotional intensity,
wonder, and lyricism.  After more mainstream expressions in these
categories are critiqued and understood as falling within the domain
of rhetoric (but what isn't within the domain of rhetoric??!), it
still remains to be asked whether one would like to have a poetry
that might include such things in it, and how might one go about such
a poetry in a way that was not cliched or overly manipulative.

Back to my talk.  I'll be glad to alert folks to the publication of
the Myth materials (late 1997?), or to those with a strong interest,
e-mail me back channel & when I get a spare moment, I'll send you a
copy (of my portion, or of the whole thing).

Part Three consists of a few pages from an essay called "The Lyric
Valuables," which began as a talk for a panel Lisa Samuels organized
at NEMLA (Montreal, April 1996).  That essay, which includes material
on Mackey, Mullen, bpNichol, Oppen, Kit Robinson, Enslin, Zukofsky,
and others, will be out in a few weeks in a special issue of _Modern
Language Studies_.  Lisa Samuels edited the issue, and it includes
essays by Joseph Conte, Jerry McGann, Tom Schaub, and Lisa (on
Hejinian), as well as some new poetry by Lyn Hejinian.  In my essay,
I try to develop some ways of sounding out new lyricisms, ways to
describe and consider the importance of odd (and perhaps initially
discordant, or in Stein's terms, "ugly") new musics in poetry.

- i for one am quite happy to argue that cliches are only epic. for
example, in all the kvetching about mafias (iowan and other), i don't
think it such a bad thing that people trust those they know. that there is
a tendency to be interested in what is known is what i find disconcerting.

actually i like the phrase "sartorial strategies" --it hisses with
calculated sibilants, it resonates with "sartor resartus," one of my
favorite books, as well as all of those sartoris characters in faulkner,
and it's broader than "cross dressing," which it seems to me refers to only
one sartorial strategy.  it also implies that one is dressed to kill, or at
least to do major military battle...etc.

You're welcome. But I didn't write that. Dodie did.

No room for "gender fuck"? It sounds like yet another instance of under-

a vis critical writing.

And that one could end up a fashion/theory victim.

My students refered to people who were overly concerned with fashion as
"fascists."  I thought that was clever.

I've been following this thread from the beginning, and all the
variations, and I've been pondering the "MFA factory" comments.

I guess you could call me a MFA "clone" except for the fact that I can
never write about things they want me to, in a voice like every one else
etc. I don't worry about voice, my voice that is.

This is probably because in my first MA workshop with Aaron Shurin
someone said something about voice, their distress in not knowing what
their voice was. Aaron said something to the effect of that really no
writer should be concerned about their voice, that maybe when you have
written a few books you can go back and see if there is something that
can be construed as voice. But before that, you can't really "pick" your
voice and decide to write in it.

So basically I don't worry about my voice as a writer. I'm much more
interested in looking at voice in other work.

since this thread seems to continue -- permit me to remind everybody of
the excellent selection of poems by Ed Roberson titled _Voices Cast Out To
Talk Us In_


in which "voice" is more in the sense of "voicings" for piano or trumpet,
matters of inflection and describable technique, as opposed to that more
mystic/mythic MFA mode of voice, as in "some of us got it and some of us
don't"

Hank:

In terms of spirituality within "innovative poetries," I'd
like to suggest a book I edited (with Craig Paulenich)a few
years back: Beneath a Single Moon: Buddhism in Contemporary American
Poetry (Shambhala, 1989, Introduction by Gary Snyder). A poetically
eclectic collection, gathering poets for whom Buddhist thought and
practice has been key. You will find statements and essays therein on
the interface of poetics and spiritual practice by people like Steve
Benson, Alan Davies, John Cage, Norman Fischer,Michael Heller, Robert
Kelly, Jackson Mac Low, Andrew Schelling, Chuck Stein, Philip Whalen,
Nathaniel Tarn, Jed Rasula, Leslie Scalapino, George Quasha, Anne
Waldman, and Armand Schwerner.

In fact, this is only a partial list of innovative writers who
take Buddhist thought seriously, and the breadth and depth of the
connection is interesting-- and would certainly need to be noted, I
think, in a study of the "fissures" (nicely put) of the spiritual
within radical poetries.

Hi every one.  This is Dale Smith via Hoa's machine.  Below is an article I read
in today's local paper from the associated press.  I found it quite telling and
right on.  It reveals the distance that has developed between theorists and mere
mortals who expect language to function as a medium of shared communication
rather than subjective solipsism.  Anyway, here's the article:

*************************************************************

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand‹‹Looking for a good read?  Here are some writers to
avoid.

The winner‹‹or loser‹‹of an academics' Bad Writing Contest announced Friday was
Frederic Jameson, a professor of comparative literature at Duke University in
North Carolina.

His book, "Signatures of the Visible," opens with this sentence:

"The visual is essentially pornographic, which is to say that it has its end in
rapt, mindless fascination; thinking about its attributes becomes an adjunct to
that, if it is unwilling to betray its object; while the most austere films
necessarily draw their energy from the attempt to repress their own excess
(rather than from the more thankless effort to discipline the viewer)."

Jameson has a significant academic following, contest organizers noted; for
their part, the judges believed reading his prose "was like swimming through
cold porridge."

Telephone calls to Jameson's home Saturday were not answered.

All the entries in the contest were from published academic works.  The top
three offenders were English professors.  The judges observed:  "This reliance
on jargon is an indication of the death throes of English as an academic
discipline."

Second place went to Rob Wilson of the University of Hawaii, whose sentence
reads, in part:

"If such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the future as post-Fordist subject,
his palpably masochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the sublime superstate
need to be decoded as the 'now-all-but-unreadable DNA' of the fast
deindustralizing Detroit...."

The third-place winner kept his sentence short, but to no avail.

"The lure of imaginary totality is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of
desire hastens on within symbolic chains," wrote Fred Botting in his 1991 work,
"Making Monstrous:  Frankenstein, Criticism, Theory."  Botting is a lecturer at
Lancaster University in England.

The contest showed that academics and major publishing houses have been so busy
using the "magical incantations of jargon, they've forgotten what real thinking
is," said contest judge Denis Dutton, senior lecturer in the philosophy of art
at Canterbury University in Christchurch.

anecdotally, I once had occasion to resort to the phrase
"anti-fashionist" -- (the occasion being the writing of a poem
responsive to a WSJ article abt. the beige craze in men's fashion)

though to speak of an "antifascist" (in the above context) wd require
folks being really in the no --

to be "fashionably out of fashion" was among the cliches Rinde Eckert
has some fun with, in his electronic opera *Slow Fire* (Paul Dresher
Ensemble, circa 1984 [?], et seq.) . . .

"fashionably late" is another matter

The Ron Padgett poem Tom Mandel --

hey, I could make that a whole stanza --

The Ron
Padgett
poem Tom
Mandel
refers to is "When I Think More of My Own Future Than of Myself". It takes
place as the speaker (one hears, if one's heard Ron, _Ron_) comes out of
the bathroom, thinking "'How sad it is that I must die.'" It's actually a
complicated procedure one performs getting to this bathroom; "one has to
go down the stairs one-half flight/Out a door into an elevated
courtyard/Along a little balcony".

The speaker of the poem proceeds to separate his (I'm presuming again)
awareness of the inevitability of death from his departure from the
bathroom.

However, just as quickly, the speaker acknowledges that one's thoughts may
change as one leaves the bathroom. So far, nothing about love! Just death,
and the bathroom, and thoughts.

The last four lines of the poem, though, contain the epigram that Tom
Mandel (and I and who knows how many other readers of the poem) carried
away:

        --Just as, since my college studies,
        When the thought was made available to me,
        I have never been able to make any sort of really reasonable
                connection
        Between Love and Death

One would _think_ (or _I_ thought, anyway) that the meaning of this poem
consisted of the safe delivery of the last two lines. Rereading it now,
though, in the wake of Tom Mandel's mention of it, it seems to me that
Padgett is making a subversive equation -- namely, that "that though one's
thoughts may change as one leaves the bathroom, leaving the bathroom does
not necessarily cause one to be aware of one's mortality" is _somehow_
analogous (equivalent?) to the statement that "though one may be educated
to assume that it is so, one cannot prove that people love eachother
because people are mortal." The epigram is a character in a little
demonstration, and though it and the famous idea it negates are attractive
and memorable, neither are at the center, the pivot of the poem on which
the speaker turns (away from sophistic half-connections?) and unironically
disavows epigrams.

The other day here at the company store, Ron confessed that he has thought
of two epigrams in his life: "If you think you saw a mouse, you did" and
"Metal was a mistake".

Near as I can remember, the term Milman Parry uses is "epithets" for the
two- or three-word tags attached to the names of gods and people to fill
out the lines of the homeric epics so they scan. I forget whether he uses
epithet to refer to those phrases (as when words escape "l'enclos de ses
dents" in the french translation Joyce liked so much) used to depict (and
magnify) certain repeated actions in the poems. The one that freaked me
out was about spears penetrating the centers of shields going straight
through to the given soldiers' nipple.

Sincerity & creating "tone" & effects to seduce the auditor are not
alternatives.  Sincerity is not a strategy.  Sincerity is not a pitfall
unless it's a ploy.

Writers work on different levels of technique, motive, & skill.  There is
pseudo-sincerity - but unless there is sincerity underlying the pseudo-,
it's not art but propaganda. Begone, ye Mickey-mockeyavellis!

At some point in my early adolescence I picked up a thick memoire called, I
think, A Syrian Yankee, about an immigrant from said country. In the course
of his travels he falls in with a group of Syrian nationalists who, as
colonials, feel that they can only raise their status by the appropriation
of the cultural icons of the conquerors. Accordingly, they develop the
theory that Shakespeare was really an arab nobleman (you guessed it--Sheik
Espeare) who somehow made his way to England. The details escape me--the
book was over 500 pages long, and the Shakespeare thing is all I remember.

a few months back, other variants on this were bandied about (in
jest) on the South Asian Literature listserv -- I'd not been aware of
A Syrian Yankee, but I do seem to recall that in his somewhat massive
-- and quite good -- tome *The Sufis*, Idris Shah has some discussion
of alleged association of Shakespeare (and/or Francis Bacon?) with
Sufi teachers/teachings -- and I do rather think the "Sheikh" thing
comes into it somehow (possibly along the lines noted in subject line
above -- a Pir being, you know, a high-level spiritual figure,
roughly translated as "saint") -- but that (likewise) was a book I
read in teens & not since . . . . but must say, in more recent
viewings of some of Shakespeare's plays (esp. some of the comedies,
but others too), one does find much akin to sufism -- the Hamlet &
Yourick tete-a-tete being (for instance) highly reminiscent of things
found in Khayyam . . .

couple summers ago, I picked up the painstakingly literal translation
of the Khayyam corpus done by a couple of British chaps, Avery and
Heath-Stubbs, and I set to, reworking a number of 'em.  For poss.
general amumsement, here's a small sampling.

            who has never drawn a breath:
  the guy whose mother never bore him --
            he shall never grieve

  Neither day nor life    can we make more long  nor less

            would swiftly pour it down the drain

Veering left at the epithet 'oral formulaic', I want to suggest that the
'formula' bears about as much relation to oral poetries as the couplet
does to written ones.  A formal device that's a special case getting
generalized to the whole.

From what I've read on oral poetry, there is no instance of strictly
'formulaic' (in Parry's sense) poetry coming from firmly oral traditions.
The Yugoslav poets Parry and Lord work from compose in a borderline
literate context.  Homer comes down to us through numerous textual stages
which impinge on the relation of formula and orality.

Check out Evers/Molina's _Yacqui Deer Songs_ or Tedlock's _Finding the
Center_ for instances of non-formulaic oral poetry.  Meanwhile, forget
about formula-- a concept overemphasizing the 'cultural preserving'
aspects of oral poetry.

Glad to introduce 'chops' here, which to me splits voice into voice(s)--at
least-- if not voicings (following Aldon).  The jazz player with chops can
play various voices, can sound like Armstrong, Davis, Bird, and Coltrane.
Here the sense of accomplished craft (perhaps a finding of ones' 'own'
styhle/voice) assumes a preliminary facility in multi-voicing.  And in
performance one earns points oftener for voice-switching than for
maintaining a steady, constant lyric self.

The intersection of threads brings to mind Baraka's "How You Sound"
(Allen, New Am Po, 1960):
        The only 'recognizalbe tradition' a poet need follow is himself...
        & with that, say, all those things out of tradition he can use,
        adapt, work over, into something for himself.  To broaden his
        *own* voice with.  (You have to start and finish there ... your
        own voice... how you sound.

Which seems obviously voice/self-centered but by 1963 ("Expressive
Language" _Home_) has broadened to:
        Words have users, but as well, users have words... Words' meanings
        but also the rhythm and syntax that frame and propel their
        concatenation, seek their culture as the final reference for what
        they are describing of the world.  An A flat played twice on the
        same saxophone by two different men does not have to sound the
        same.

That's chops.

"All I have is a voice"!

Does Auden preempt Jordan's remarks on Padgett's disavowing epigram?
In the same stanza as that "voice" line, Auden wrote the love or
die epigram, then of course disavowed the whole thing.  And later
wrote a great poem about bathrooms.

i'll put in a vote for lowell's notebook, which was brought back into print
after a long absence. i find it fascinating stuff -- some of the poems,
like Exra Pound, have about five published variant versions -- lowell made
corrections on the 2nd printing, published a revised Notebook, broke the
volume into smaller volumes, then revised some poems twice in each edition
of the selected.
        there a story there about lowell & the fetish of revising. during
his heyday, young acolytes would revise there poems hundreds of times like
their mentor. late poems were VERY troubling to his fans, which might
account as to why there is no collected to appear (in addition to the
editor's dilemma of picking among revisions). still, i think he's a lot
more interesting poet in hindsight --now that he no longer grand poobah of
verse (it seems that E. bishop has much more of an impact).

Somebody (Abbie Hoffman? or David Bowie, who should know) said that
"fashion is fascism."

Something in the new and highly recommended _Poetic Briefs_ ("Shadows:
New & Selected Dialogues on Poetics by Mark Wallace and Jefferson
Hansen") struck me as fascinating commentary on poetic fashion, or
perhaps fashion commentary on poetic fascism:

"...At a recent reading, I was told the story of a poet who's been

creeping back into his writing, and he had become so worried about his
'social complicity' that he couldn't write for a long time.  And I
thought it sounded like a story of someone who was stuck on avant garde
writing as closing possibilities, not opening them, because his thoughts
on poetry were still riddled with shoulds and shouldn'ts, and
'narrative' for him had become a shouldn't.  I thought that was sad,
because for me avant garde had always been about saying 'fuck you' to
the shouldn'ts, not just about having a new set of them."  [MW]

Have to admit that what I immediately saw was a cartoon: wretched,
disheveled poet sits on a couch, head in hands, while friends to the
side whisper "George is disconsolate about the social complicity of his
poems."

Talk about being "too wrapped up in [your] own importance to leave any
breathing space," as Pam Brown quoted Laurie Duggan (on poems of voice).

Anyway, thanks to all for the voice posts--many of these have already
become important reference points when I argue with myself in the
shower.

Hi, this is Kevin Killian, in psychic bewilderment about what is going on
in above item.  Is Mr. Hoover to be reviled because he accepted some kind
of prize from Mr. Marvin Bell?  If so, what to be made of Mr. Gander, who
accepted some kind of "visiting poet" post from Mr. Bell?  I don't get it.

Sounds like all of us should stay out of bars, where students congregate,
since students will report what we say to our enemies.  Report or distort,
since I, once a student myself, remember delighting myself in complete
invention and once gave such a terrible account of the ancient Katherine
Anne Porter that she died a few weeks later.  I was also there during
Robert Lowell's last poetry reading and yes, went to a bar with him
afterwards, and then he got on that plane and, well, died while I was still
lying about him!  I felt no guilt about this and believe that few students
would.  If there are other students on this list perhaps you can confirm or
deny my suspicions.

As for McVay's note that  "Jorie Graham is well known for never accepting a
gig unless there's something in it for hubby James Galvin too," it's true
that Elizabeth Taylor killed her own career by making too many films with
Richard Burton. But I keep thinking, God, can't Bruce Willis think of some
way to help poor Demi Moore out of her precarious pitch on the lower slopes
of hasbeenism?

I feel for these people.  But now I am thinking that perhaps Johnson means
only that Gander should have gotten the award, if he is the "significantly
greater poet" than Hoover, while Hoover should have been content with the
visiting poet position?  I say, give it a rest, all will come right at the
end.  I'm sure none of these people are half as bad as Johnson has made
them out to be.  We're only here for a short while and we might as well try
to hold out the olive branch and peace, love and understanding.

i actually think jameson is quite a good writer.  i wonder why it is that
marxist theorists come in for this kind of anti-intellectual bashing, while
for example medical research scientists aren't taken to task for the
"esoteric jargon" they use to describe simple human functions like
breathing or digesting.  since the "judge" of the contest is himself a
humanist scholar, i suspect some petty generational ressentiment on the

I think chops is a great way of looking at this voice thing.  A lot of
problems with the term "voice" is that it's too broad:  everyone's got a
voice.  What's at stake is the nervous desire to make each voice (your
voice) unique.  This may be a foolish desire, up there with wanting to be a
famous poet, but, like Dodie, I don't want my poems to look/sound like
anyone else's (especially all those hordes of other MFAs out there).
That's why I work on my chops."

I like this idea too, but in another context I was thinking about 'voice' &
subjectivity. The concept does seem to be attached to the ideal of a
singular, settled subjectivity. At which point the famous Aussie modernist
poet, Ern Malley came to mind (again: there was a discussion of this
wonderful hoax that backfired earlier this year). Because it suddenly
occured to me that 'ern' does have 'his' own voice, felt throughout, but
its very presence sure does undermine the very concept as attached to that
singular, settled subjectivity so much of the poetry the writers on this
list write also seeks to question. There's poor young 'ern,' the written
effect of two poets (who believed each in his own voice), created by a
number of aleotropic means they did not believe in, & yet the poems, which
also work much better than they believed could be so, & the poems do seem
to have a recogizable 'voice.' Hmm. Indeed.

With medical research, it's necessary. I've taught pomo a number of times
(graduate level etc.) and still find Jameson turgid. And I do think that a
lot of theory has become self-referential, pebbled with reification, etc.
- as if there were nothing left to do.

Dear Rumor-mongers:  Paul Hoover has not been in Iowa City since, I think,
1974, when one of our friends lived there and went t o library school and
nwe visited him.  As for the Georgia Prize, Mr. Hoover entered the contest
which Mr. Bell happened to judge for that year.  Like all people who get
chosen by someone, he had no idea who the judge would be and became a
finalist on the authority of Bin Ramke.  What does this all mean?  That
perhaps there are better things to talk about than how someone gets a book
published.  Perhaps if the story of Paul Hoover's visit to an Iowa bar
wnhere he conspired with Marvin Bell to get his new book, Viridian (read
it, it['s very good and has little to do with Marvin Bell's usual
aesthetic) published, is getting circulated in Iowa and on this list, the
circulating is perpetrated by people who perhaps wish they had a new book.
No?

As for who chooses us for what, anyone who has ever taken grant money,
accepted a cxheck from a rather compromised source, a federal or local
government, and anyone who ever got published by a major press, well I
hate to think of where $$ comes from, even for publishing ventures!  So
Kent Johnson should either check his sources or ask Ted Buczinsky to
advice on living purely and simply in harmony with nature outside the
military/industrial/university/publishing/Marvin Bell/Iowa City Bar
conspiracy.

ah, thanks, -- I didn't *think* the chap was referring to heavy-metal as a

Germany's Daimler-Benz has developed a prototype "cyber

   rests, and a voice activation system for drivers to control the
   system without taking their hands from the steering wheel. A

   options and services" for drivers. (UPI)

Another thought:  The last time Paul Hoover wasn't in Iowa City, he also
wasn't "talking shit" about Forrest Gander, whom he and I last saw in SF
in fall of this year.  Hi, Forrest, if you're listening.  Tell you pal Ken

David Israel's observations re Indian epics are accurate, as far as they
go. But there is a whole other universe of epic in India, in all of the
vernacular languages, about which very little is known [by us].  For the
most part, these epics have been subjected to the techniques of folklore
analysis, rather than to what might be called literary analysis [which is
to say that attention has been given more to their content, genre,
performance, sociology, etc., than to their "literary merit"]. Their
subject matter is very diverse [again, not always that "arms and the man"
stuff that we might expect]. But one thing that they all have in common is
that they are "popular", very literally.

As for the Sanskrit epics that David refers to, the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana: their authors were in no way "individual writers", even if they
are represented as such in the epics themselves. Vyasa and Valmiki [and
Homer, for that matter] are "real", I have to say, *only* in the same sense
that Zeus or Achilles or Krishna or Arjuna are "real."

This is not to say that there were not individual performers who, by means
of their verbal, or narrative, or psychological, or other sorts of
dexterity, profoundly modified their traditions.  But these are
"individuals"  who operated within a tradition that embraced them, and
which they embraced in turn.  I don't think that you see "the anxiety of
influence" and other literate diseases in them. Their relationship to name
and signature is rather intriguing too [but that's another story]..

David is also right in pointing out that, in India, epic and Vedic are two
entirely distinct strands in the tradition. You might find it interesting
to know that the Vedic cognate of the Greek word 'epos" is "vacas", which
means "word, utterance, hymn."

So my own work isn't so much focussed on the poetics of the epic, as much
as on the poetics of the hymn.  But for historical reasons there is a
connection between these in Indo-European.

Maria,

Actually, I never criticized the phrase--I just criticized the writers' bad
taste in using it when a simpler word would have worked better.  Some
things work in some contexts, but not in others.  A lime green scarf with a
red pants suit might be yuck, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't look
fabulous with a black pants suit.

As far as Jameson goes, writing such as in the passage Dale quoted has an
appealing poetry to me, the kind of thing I would underline heavily for a
chapter, steal from, and then drop the book on the bedroom floor with the
other dejecta of my life.

Subject:      Re: voice & refrain

For those of us who grew up under
the sway of new criticism in which
usually the guy in the poem was identified
always as "the speaker", and not say
Keats, wasn't it also a given that
such a speaker would have a "voice."(?)
I'm curious and too lazy to research
why that "voice" in the poem was called
a "speaker" in the first place. For a
critical movement that prided itself
on pointing out fallacies of one sort
or another ("pathetic fallacy") etc.
it's ironic (to use another favorite
critical expression of the time) to see
the old "speaker" and "voice" be given
the a perhaps similar "pathetic" heave.

I prefer the notion of "signature" in the
way that a writer's work, overtime, will
achieve that- and within that signature
there will be layers and varieties
of change (focus, content, rhythms,
color etc.) Yet - in the mature work -
 there is something constant there -
 and I will refrain from using the word
"sensibility" -- since I think that
word avoids deeper issues of form,
structure, etc.

I've never understood the idea that Ern Malley "backfired." I thought the
point of the hoax was that it was possible for two clever jokers to do
much _better_ at modernism by _not_ taking it seriously than one serious
determined dilletante could by turning his whole 'vegetative eye' to it.
The invention of the poet only works if the poems "work". If the point was
to pass rubbish off as great, then whoops! I admired something hateful.

Passing this on for those interested. The show has some great stuff in it,
including a Tom Raworth book done by Alastair Johnston & much that works well
as visual poetry, often erupting into a 'sculptural' realm.

(Would also point out the show, "Artist's Books Today," a survey of
sculptural expanded books curated by Carol Barton, through June 14 at the San
Francisco Center for the Book, 300 De Haro. 415.565.0545.)

will be on display in the San Francisco Public Library's 6th Floor Skylight
Gallery, Civic Center, through June 28, 1997.

What is a book? Should it have words, pages, covers? The works of book
artists
today try to answer these questions and their answers provide a fascinating
and
often bizarre look at the ancient form of the book. Where else but in the
PCBA
show can you see such diversities as Chinese scrolls, wax tablets in the
Roman
style and surrealist poetry hidden inside kitchen toasters?

The members of PCBA represent traditional craftsmanship and innovative
experimentation. They are calligraphers, bookbinders, fine printers, book
artists and xerographers. Some use the computer to help generate their books;
some have never been near a computer in their lives, but rely on good old-
fashioned lead and sticky ink to get their words onto paper. Others have
forsaken paper altogether and print on Plexiglas, fruit, or match sticks.

The exhibitors in this year's show include many well-known book artists from
the Bay Area, across the country, and abroad. Newcomers are always
encouraged,
and the D. Steven Corey Award is given to one artist whose work exemplifies
PCBA's pioneering spirit.

Dear Kent Johnson:

I'm responding to your post of May 19 in which you claim that my book
VIRIDIAN was selected by Marvin Bell for the National Poetry Series
because I had schmoozed with him at an Iowa City bar.

First, your errors of fact:

(1)  I have not been in Iowa City since the 1970s.
(2)  The book won the Georgia Prize, not the National Poetry Series.
(3)  Marvin Bell does not head the Iowa Writer's Workshop, though he has
taught there for many years.
(4)  I would never slander Forrest Gander.  We had dinner with him at
Frances Mayes' house in San Francisco in the fall, and he was good
company.  I have read his work with interest and respect it.
(5)  Because I did an anthology of postmodern poetry doesn't mean I'm
locked into an ideology.  I like expressive poetry, too, when it has
intelligence and freshness.  My anthology, like the magazine NEW AMERICAN
WRITING, has been noted for its range.  It includes August Kleinzahler,
who is very far from being a language poet.
(6)  The final judge of the Georgia Prize was never announced, at his or
her request.  The reasons for this are mysterious.  I heard through rumor
that the judge was Marvin Bell.  If so, thanks.

And what if he were the judge?  Is it somehow wrong for him to pick
a poet from outside a given community?

You may like Forrest Gander's work better than mine, which is fine.  I
don't see a necessary opposition between the two of us.  I do know that he
is open to more than one concept of the poem, which is also my position.
I doubt that you have read much of my work.

We should ask ourselves why the Ashberys and Ginsbergs were included in
anthologies of contemporary American poetry, but the Nathaniel Mackeys
and Lyn Hejinians are not.  A strict sense of opposition has been the
rule, always to the exclusion of the "experimental."

But the larger problem is the economy of poetry in the boomer era.
Everyone is encamped because of the market niches demanded by too large a
supply of poets.  Poets become resentful because there isn't enough reward
to go around, despite the explosion of prizes, grants, and awards
announced in POETS AND WRITERS.

I'm responding, by the way, not to your original post but to how it is
excerpted in Kevin Killian's response. Could someone backchannel me the
original?

Henry,

You're referring to, of course, Ray's _Apu Trilogy_:

_Panther Panchali_ (Song of the Little Road) 1955
_Aparajito_ (The Unvanquished) 1956
_Apur Sansar_ (The World of Apu) 1959

available individually, or as a boxed set at just about any Border's.
Old, scratchy, hard-to-read subtitles, shaky sound, but beautiful,
enlightening, and transcendent to film buffs, and those interested in
Hinduism and the "Indian Epic."

There's a Satyajit Ray Filmography at:

and a nice little essay about Ray and _The World of Apu_ at:

I just re-subscribed and happy to come back. Let's see...I feel I should
contribute some kind of snippet, so here goes: I heard from a friend that
Paul Hoover's book (the editor of the humoungous (sp?)
Norton _Postmodern American Poetry_), had been selected by none
other than Marvin Bell, most recently author of the very depressing
series "Poems of the Dead Man," and director, I think, of the Iowa
Writer's Workshop, for the "coveted" National Poetry Series!

I was wondering: Is this cause for rejoicing, embarrassment, second-
thoughts, or factional reconciliation? Certainly, Mr. Hoover's authority
as an arbiter of "Postmodernism" (insofar as he gladly accepts Mr. Bell's
approval) might be called into question?

I was, in part, wondering, because I heard from a third party that when
Mr. Hoover was in Iowa City a couple months ago, he talked shit at the
bar to Creative Writing students about my friend (and significantly
greater poet than he) Forrest Gander, who was visiting poet at the time
there. Is it possible, I wonder, that Mr. Hoover's little visit to Iowa City
could have had something to do with his little prize? (I would like to say
here that if Forrest knew I was writing this, he would be extremely
pissed, and he will certainly be when he finds out, but I can't contain
myself...).

anyway, it's good to be back. I've missed the great people on this list!
Even Bromige and Bowering, who write code behind everybody's back.

Dear George Thompson:

First of all, let me apologize for the somewhat snarky tone of my
response to your original post. Your opening seemed a bit condescending
to "poets", as if they would be too busy rhyming or whatever to have
paid attention to the basic intellectual debates about the nature of
epic, and I responded somewhat sharply. Excuse me.

I still stick to my main, point, however, that the theory you present
is just that--theory--whether Parry's or your own--not fact. Your
proposal about Homeric formulas or cliches has no claim on
truth--it's an imaginative reconstruction based on a philological
analysis of texts written down long after the poems were "composed"
(whatever that word may mean in this context). We have no way of
_knowing_ what function those verbal forms played 3,000 years ago. We
can look at how oral traditions today work and argue for parallels,
but, again, it's an imaginative leap, not a statement of truth. They
could very well have worked the same way all those memorized riffs
worked for John Coltrane--as a kind of foundational vocabulary to fall
back on or take off from during the process of improvisation. That's
as likely as anything else.

Classicists have a different imagination of their relationship to
epic than poets do--but the difference is not in their access to or
awareness of current and past scholarship. It's in the use to which they
see that relationship being put. Classicists--and I apologize in
advance if I distort a position that's not my own--see themselves as
studying the poetry in order to arrive at a more "accurate" measure
(perhaps just a new measure) of the origin and development of the
form--i.e. a new theory. Poets (those who are interested) need to
figure out a relationship in order to proceed with making poems.
Neither relationship has a greater claim on "truth". Both are
fundamentally imaginative. But poets do seem more forthcoming about
that than scholars, who frequently seem to want to cover their tracks.

Who, after all, had the more interesting theory of the epic: Virgil,
Dante, Milton, Blake, H.D., Olson? or Milman Parry? I know who I think
people will be reading 500 years from now. And reading for the news.

Best,
Mike

I want to contribute a note of defense on Marvin's behalf; I worked with
him the course of my MFA at Iowa (can I expect to be flamed now?) and have
known him for a few years and can tell you that if he did or does pick
poets' work for awards, prizes, etc.  which are radically different from
his own "aesthetic" that wouldn't be at all surprising.  He's extremely
deft and knowledgable as a reader and can see and value what's going on in
a poet's work or in a "school" of poetry like nobody's business.  I am not
sure what his "tastes" are--but  he does know what the hell he's looking at
and how to talk about it and value it, to be sure, and to say the very
least.  Early on in my work here, he recommended I read Scalapino's work as
well as someone of "his generation" of people like Hecht in order to think
about some problems I was working on in a particulr poem at a formal level.
Finally, as the Flannery O' Connor Professor of Letters, he'd be in an easy
position to skip "undergaduate workshop teaching duty" or to fill the
course with Ph.D.'s from other departments (i.e. not
undergraduates)--something he never does and remains strongly commited,
from what I can see, to beginning writers here--which is not an elite but
state school serving some 400+ per year undergraduate students in various
workshops (fiction, poetry, nonfiction): i.e. to a democratic process of
teaching and learning.  So, any more trash about the Workshop, please
check your facts with those of us who are here and don't necessarily find
it the worst place on earth to be.  Many of the problems cited in these
conversations have to do with market issues, the commodification of poetry
and the arts, the use of "debates" about the NEA as a smoke screen for the
far right to justify and cover their campaigns of terror against women, the
poor, people of color and lesbigay people.  There are far more relevant
issues to discuss about the problems within the  poetry industry: how about
sexual harrassment at institutions and why MFA programs don't seem to have
a problem hiring people (usually men) who have been dismissed or are "on
leave" for harassing, intimidating or assaulting students?  Now that's some
terrifying stuff.  Seems we have bigger fish to fry here people if we want
to deal with issues which affect us as writers and teachers and which
affect our students.

Much 'medical' 'research' can be questioned as to its

". . . there is the private matter of my own pleasure in writing these
texts: it is a pleasure tied up in the peculiarities of my 'difficult'
style (if that's what it is). I wouldn't write them unless there where
some minimal gratification for myself, and I hope we are not yet too
alienated or instrumentalized to reserve some small place for what used
to be handicraft satisfaction." (Jameson in _Diacritics_ 12)

Theories of theories.

Self-referentiality and/or re-ificaiton do not necessarily mean
quiesence or abjection. 'Re-ification' in particular for Jameson is what
he calls the 'meditory code' (following Lukacs) that he writes *in* not
*of*. Pebbled perhaps, but more like a Hansel and Gretel minima moralia.
A trail surreptitiously left to find one's way out of the forest. That
is if one believes in that particular hope of escape, that particulare
'persistence of the dialectic'.

But I guess we are in post-theory times. 'Nothing left to do' but mark
the return of the real . . . our journal(s) of the plague(s) year(s).

Julia Kristeva in _Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection_ triangulates
the 'abject' subject with the 'deject': "The one by whom the abject
exists is thus a *deject*. . . . A deviser of territories, languages,
works, the *deject* never stops demarcating his universe whose fluid
confines . . . A tireless builder the deject is in short a *stray*. He
is on a journey, during the night, the end of which keeps receding . . .
the more he strays, the more he is saved."

                          *** OTHER VOICES ***

    An Electronic Journal of Critical Inquiry Published by the Students

                   http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~othervcs

__________________________________________________________________________


Other Voices, a new electronic journal based at the University of
Pennsylvania, has just released its first issue.  Other Voices is a
quarterly publication dedicated to interdisciplinary criticism in the
humanities and social sciences founded in March 1997 in response to the
limited number of local publications highlighting advanced undergraduate
and graduate work in the humanities.

Other Voices is dedicated to publishing criticism and research that both
reflects current scholarship and highlights the diversity of the
University of Pennsylvania's academic environment.  It is not envisioned
as a forum for editorial opinion or discussion of current events per se,
but instead as a challenge to students who would wish to critically
analyze specific cultural products, contemporary thought, or our current
historical circumstances from within a variety of discursive frames.  Its
format is conceived specifically as an alternative to both the
one-dimensionality common in standard political and literary publications,
and the superficiality of the op-ed newspaper piece.

                *** Table of Contents, vol. 1, no. 1 ***

Other Voices is currently accepting submissions for its next issue (Vol. 1
No. 2). These should be received (by email or post) NO LATER THAN:

                            May 30th, 1997

Submissions recieved after that date will be held for future consideration.

In lieu of standard paper publication, Other Voices takes advantage of the
capabilities of the Internet for author/reader interaction, public
dialogue, and multimedia presentation.  Thus, submissions may take a
variety of forms ranging from more traditional academic essays and book
reviews to multimedia presentations involving video, inline images, sound
and text.  Individual issues of the journal are constructed around a core
of six to eight scholarly articles; one or two hypertext/multimedia
projects; a transcribed lecture, panel discussion or interview; and a
variable number of book reviews.  We strongly encourage our readership to
submit suggestions for projects falling outside of this scope.

Submissions from any source are warmly welcomed; however, we especially
encourage participation by students of the University of Pennsylvania and
other regional universities in the local tri-state area.

Please consult the our site for specific information on formating
requirements.

[a re-post here, the below sent this morning (but not posted) before
various posts by Paul Hoover, Maxine Chernoff, and others.]

To the list:

 One thing I will never do again is come up to the computer with
 a chip on my shoulder after over-celebrating the dawn of summer break
 with open-walleted colleagues. The truth is that Kevin Killian above
 lets me off the hook fairly easily, I think. My post on "dirty
 postmodernism" was idiotic and, like most dirty gossip, devoid of
 logical argument. I regret it, and offer, for what it's worth, an
 apology to Paul Hoover, whom I've never even talked to, and to
 Forrest, whom I certainly embarrassed by bringing up his name in such
 a context without any permission from him. And, for the stained
 record, it turns out that my comment about Paul Hoover "talking shit"
 about Forrest to the latter's students (the cause of my
 indignation) was based on misinformation heard from someone I haven't
 mentioned. What a way to come back to the list and say hello.

 Now, I still do think that there is some interesting irony in Mr.
 Hoover (an arbiter and champion of radical American poetics) being
 selected by Mr. Bell (a long-time arbiter and champion of the
 standard) and I wouldn't retract my questions relating to it. And I
 think the matter is interesting because it seems to have something to
 do with the "avant-garde's" relation to the culture industry (or at
 least its willing (or unwitting) absorption into it. I realize the
 issue is an old one and maybe it's just a little thing- - so what,
 as Kevin says, if Bell selected Hoover's book? Isn't it better if
 we all just get along and extend the olive branches of prestigious
 awards to one another? But I wonder about the imperceptible accretion
 of those small things and where they lead. I remember being in
 Holland last year and going into a museum and coming upon all these
 collages by Schwitters encased in massive, gilded frames... Maybe
 there's nothing to be done about it.

and don't lets forget Jameson has written that he includes himself (e.g.,
in _Marxism and Form_) among Marxist theorists (Adorno, Sartre) who have
attempted to "include the dialectical process in every sentence" (this
paraphrase from memory is originally from _Search for a Method_, I think*),
a 'method' of writing that deliberately complicates the grammar in a manner
not necessarily unlike the work of some of our listees, who attempt to make
the act of reading more clear, all it glorious complexity

the difference between Jameson's prose and that of either of the other two
is marked

I wouldn't blame anyone for expressing annoyance with some of the early,
excessive, claims of Parry and Lord and other early theorists of the
formula.  But I don't agree with this suggestion at all. I myself try to
avoid making large universal claims that are beyond my competence to
defend, or simply beyond proof in any sense. So I have never said that
*all* oral poetry is formulaic.  But I do think that the formula exists at
a far deeper level of linguistic structure than the couplet does. And that
it is important to understand it before throwing it out.

First there is *at least* one sure "instance of strictly 'formulaic' (in
Parry's sense) poetry coming from firmly oral traditions" -- and that is
Vedic.  Completely pre-literate. Highly formulaic. You will not understand
Vedic very well if you don't pay attention to its formulaic patterns. The
problem here is that the *transmission* of oral poetic traditions to us,
here at our desks, ultimately has to pass through some written stage. Sure.
But I myself am convinced that at their roots [in "Homer"] both the Ill and
the Odd also were orally composed and largely formulaic.

The existence of just a few non-formulaic poetries [*if* such a thing could
actually exist, theoretically speaking] does not mean that there are not
many, many more *significantly* formulaic poetries out there. And there
are.

And finally, the formula has many other aspects than these 'cultural
preserving' aspects, which, I agree, have been over-emphasized. Formulas
also have, just for example, poetic features: i.e., they can be used to
contribute to poetic structure. They also have what is called "phatic"
features: they generate a sense of complicity, community, comfort, between
performer and audience.

The question we shd ask ourselves here has been one of the perennial topics
on this list.  And I happen to agree with the statement in the second
paragraph. The unstated corollary, however, is that the "experimental"
has also become a niche (as a way of dealing with "the larger problem").
The only solution is narrative: write stories which contain the poetic
para-narrative (in verse, of course) presenting the encapsulation of
boomer destiny in a suitable award-winning minus-zero centigrade of
"originality" ("The most original writers are, of course, the most
accomplished imitators" - Eric Blarnes) and "experiment" ("Experimented
on a gopher once" - Jack Spandrift).  And remember, in non-literate
cultures, "niche" rhymes with "cliche".  - Henry Gould

I think the notion of speaker re: NC is fundamentally different from

Though I believe that Gideon should put out an edition of _Powers of
Horror_, I came upon dejecta via Catherine Clement's "The Guilty One" in
_The Newly Born Woman_  (Minnesota, 1986), a book that was originally
published in France in 1975.  Clement's essay, which covers many of the
very things that sound so dopey in 70s American feminism and makes them
fascinating, reclaimed 70s feminism for me.  On page 37 she compares the
writer to the hysteric (in response to an anonymous text about coughing up
dead words):

"A wonderful anonymous text . . . which connects the hysterical cough to
writing.  The writer puts his dejecta on paper.  But with this difference,
radical in its effects: the symbolic inscription of the written wastes is
published and passes into another register.  That is where the passionate
thread of these wandering associations stops.  For the hysteric does *not*
write, does *not* produce, does nothing--nothing other than makes things
circulate without inscribing them."

But I've seen dejecta many a place since then.  It *is* one of my favorite
words, I use it whenever I get the chance I love it so much.

No room for "gender fuck"? It sounds like yet another instance of under-

Subject:      Re: voice & refrain and...

For about a year now, and especially since the 'voice' thread began, I've
been mulling over what seems to be/have been a surge in the use of
'dramatic monologue.' In the past few years I've seen what seems to be a
proliferation of books with 'characters,' often enough set in specific
historic periods. Right away Voigt's "Kyrie" comes to mind, a book which is
if I'm not mistaken a semi-epistolary sonnet series based in the post-WWI
Spanish flu-pandemic.

My question to the list is, if there is a surge in the first place, what if
anything does it represent with regards to attitudes about 'voice,'
'speaker,' the value placed on personal experience,...? Is it a kind of
backlash against the private world(s) of poets, or a fumbling around for
new 'subjects'...?

Any thoughts?

One is about the "chameleon poet" (b[o]y george)

George:

It's great to have some engagement on these issues.  Thanks for
picking up the thread!

Glad we agree at least that the mnemonic function of formulae
has been overemphasized.  But can the term now be separated from these
concerns?  For the poetic (structural) and performative features
in this family I prefer something like repetition, or riff--
which leads to parallelism and other aural effects (which fascinate
me in oral and written poetries).

I think we're having a difference of opinion that's pretty well
established.  Interesting evidence of the rift among oralists can
be found in the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetics where Lord writes
the entry on  oral poetry (pretty much collapsing it into oral formulaic
theory, ie. treating 'oral poetry' and 'oral formulaic poetry' as nearly
synonomous).  [Compare the entry on Ethnopoetics]

Here Lord defines 'formula' as "a word or group
of words regularly used under given metrical conditions to express
a given essential idea."  This regularity and the push to expression
of given essential ideas reflects the kind of focus on oral-art-as-
cultural-preservation that I gestured towards earlier.

I'll admit not knowing my Vedic; but Walter Ong's _Orality and
Literacy_ casts pretty strong doubts (to my mind persuasive) on
their purely oral foundation.  (Meaning that the formulaic elements,
however present, could have grown from brushes with literacy. His
larger point, which I suspect you'd concur with, is to emphasize that
verbatim repetition is not characteristic of 'oral' poetry.)

You write:
        The existence of just a few non-formulaic poetries
        [*if* such a thing could actually exist, theoretically
        speaking] does not mean that there are not many, many more
        *significantly* formulaic poetries out there.
Perhaps I'm missing the theoretical impasse--but any time a song
is improvised, can't it be non-formulaic.  Now I guess what
constitutes a significant degree of formulaic pattern is debatable.
(This I guess was part of the Parry mission, to persuade that the
level of formulaic patterning in Homer showed it to be 'oral'--
bear with me, I'm no classicist.)

Quibbling aside, if I read the above right you are suggesting that
non-formulaic oral poetry IS the EXCEPTION rather than the rule.
I'll give you Vedic and Yugoslav Epic, and throw in one or to
others... but still my understanding is that much oral poetry is
in no meaningful way 'formulaic'--does not rely on a restricted
collection of epithets for composition.

This (what I'll call an) erring toward the formulaic seems like a
tendency of folks for whom oral poetry is an ancient (dead) art.
And formula let's em have there cake and eat it too with respect to
Epic--the text is relatively stable (cf. masterpieces of literature); is
oral in origin; was conceivably spoken by one 'man' (call him Homer or
Singer of the Tribe if you like) in one voice; a proto-author.
(Here I betray my sense the Kalevala, said to be a reconstructed epic, is
in fact a written Epic composed from oral sources, that there perhaps can
be no Oral Epics like the Odyssesy, unless the corpus of the blues, taken
as a whole and assembled end-to-end (stretching to the moon) is the great
African American Epic.)

Just a few miles up or down the road from here (Buffalo, NY) one
could seek out non-formulaic oral poetry.  I mentioned a few examples,
last post, of books on my shelf.  I'll add now the whole run of
ALCHERINGA/Ethnopoetics.  Most Native American poetry... etc.

Should we take this back channel soon?
Back to you,

Ken

Yeah, and the worst think about it is that I hear MARVIN BELL had the
audacity to sign MARJORIE PERLOFF'S NAME to an article in which the death of
the author is invoked to justify play (AS LONG AS IT ISN'T IN MY BACK
YARD---see Derrida for practice/preach dualism "reinscribed") in which the
UNAMBOMBER fesses us to being FOREST GUMP i mean gander and the pen that
wrote YASUDA is found in the home of PAUL HOOVER while the swan falls into
the firebird and none of the big publishers like my idea for a coffee table
book called PIGEONS (go figure).

I want to understand Jameson's sentence.  Calling the contest's
judge a "humanist" or sniffing ideological bias--both true, as
I know from another List--still does not help me make more than
vague sense of Jameson's sentence.  Nor does Michael Corbin's
defense help:


> Self-referentiality and/or re-ificaiton do not necessarily mean
> quiesence or abjection. 'Re-ification' in particular for Jameson is what
> he calls the 'meditory code' (following Lukacs) that he writes *in* not
> *of*. Pebbled perhaps, but more like a Hansel and Gretel minima moralia.
> A trail surreptitiously left to find one's way out of the forest. That
> is if one believes in that particular hope of escape, that particulare
> 'persistence of the dialectic'.


Not enough trail here for me, although, as with reading Jameson's
sentence, I can vaguely see where I am.  I read posts here that unabashedly
paraphrase difficult poems.  So can those who attacked the
Bad Writing Contest and defended Jameson explain his *sentence*?


"The visual is essentially pornographic, which is to say that it has its end in
rapt, mindless fascination; thinking about its attributes becomes an adjunct to
that, if it is unwilling to betray its object; while the most austere films
necessarily draw their energy from the attempt to repress their own excess
(rather than from the more thankless effort to discipline the viewer)."


You don't need to rehash Jameson's theory or its aims.  Assume I'm
willing to sympathize with his dialectic, have read his own defense
(in _Marxism and Form_) of the prose he claims to imitate, and know that
your explanation will lose the poetry in the translation.  My guess, however,
is that some of your explanations will lose nothing, do better what
Jameson intended to do, and show that at least in this sentence he
wrote very badly.

Lucidly,
Mark Baker

Well, I'll try.  My experience is that most, anywhere from 50 to 95%
generally speaking, of what I hear at poetry readings is the equivalent of
chatter.  I'm by no means excepting my own poetry when I say this.  Every
so often, a line will come into being with a resonance in it that calls for
remembering.  When the chattering voice becomes the calling voice, I start
writing.  The challenge then is to hold the whole line in my inner ear
until I have it all written down, cause if the next line is also in the
calling voice, it will often replace the half-written one and I won't be
able to write down either.  It's transpersonal in that it's always the
calling voice, but each poet sounds the call in hir own accent (to put it
metaphysically as well as geographically).  So, sometimes the voice does
resonate with my own in that I recognize the "dialect" as if from a locale
I've stayed in (I can often, though not always, tell when someone's been
influenced by the Celan of _Breathturn_, since I've been reading that
obsessively since Pierre Joris' translation came out); at other times, and
this is getting more rare as I spend more time on the planet, the voice
will strike me as utterly otherworldly, something I couldn't have conceived
of sounding like.  My natural tendency is to try to speak the dialect, that
is, to mimic a new and interesting voice; but there are plenty of
exceptions to that, things that, for whatever reason, I don't think sound
interesting when spoken in my voice.

...It takes to fill New Langton Arts.  Saturday, May 17th, through dawn on
Sunday the 18th, Alex Cory took over the literary directorship of New
Langton Arts with a marathon reading dubbed, "A Night in the Life of San
Francisco Writing."  I have no notes to report from, since I was busy
manning a camera for the first 3 hours and a little overwhelmed by heat and
the sheer magnitude of the beast to do much after that, but I had a great
time and I'll share what I can of the event with you.  Anyway, the whole
thing was captured on 3 video cameras and a cassette recording made using a
clip-on mic, with a fourth camera interviewing poets upstairs, so watch for
the documentary in the future.  Each writer read for approximately 15 minutes:

Lyn Hejinian kicked things off just after 4 PM by reading a new piece and
an older one.  She was followed by Kit Robinson, who read the complete
"Messianic Trees."  Next Robert Gluck read a couple of funny prose pieces
on community, one literary, the other residential.  Jean Day followed, then
Bill Berkson, reading a few things, including some for Ginsberg.  Next came
Robert Hale, Laura Moriarty, Avery Burns.  New College newcomer Jono
Schneider read from his "100 Pages Which Scrape the Face of 'God'".  Jack
and Adelle Foley gave their usual energetic performance of 2 pieces, one
for Allen Ginsberg, one for Jake Berry.  Aaron Shurin followed with new
work, then Gloria Frym read recent prose-poems.  Kevin Killian read from
his Argento series to record it for posterity, then Benjamin Hollander read
his work "Onome".  George Albon read from three different projects, one
old, one new, and one kind of both (he wrote back through poems he'd
written in high school, sometimes incorporating lines but more often simply
commenting on the original work somehow).  I got off my shift on the camera
and was incredibly hungry, so I went across the street to Pizza Love for a
slice of cheese with pineapple.  I missed Leslie Scalapino and most of
Rodrigo Toscano in the process, but believe me, it was unavoidable.  Craig
Dworkin read poems and made intriguing phonemic gestures, to be followed by
Norma Cole, Jaime Robles, and Robin Trembley-McGaw.  Darin DeStefano then
read some new work, including a long poem (he said he'd never read a long
poem before because he hated it when people read long poems at readings).
Linda Voris next read some prose-poems laid out four-square on the page
(she showed us), followed by Faith Barrett, then Scott Bentley, and Alicia
Wing read from her just-completed (after 2 years and 7 months, you go,
girl!) manuscript.  Glenn Ingersoll was next, but I had to get some fresh
air and quiet my mind and figure out what I was going to read (sorry
Glenn!) so I sneaked out again.

By now it was after 11:00 PM and Camille Roy was up with that great short
bleached hair, straight-leg jeans and ripped up but still wearable Converse
look, reading from her work about jaded 15-year-olds.  Renee Gladman
followed with what I thought was one of the highlights of the festival
(just wait for the film).  Eric Selland read from new work (prose poems)
and old, followed by Pamela Lu reading a serial poem, Katie Lederer
performing a serial poem about a girl and her dad.  Lauren Gudath and Kathy
Lou Schultz followed Katie, then Travis Ortiz read his dense philosophical
poetry.  Lytle Shaw, Jocelyn Saidenberg, and then it was my turn.  It was
1:45 am.  I'd been scheduled for 1:30, so considering the huge number of
readers, we weren't too far off schedule.  There were still maybe 15 people
in the audience (during the peak hours, there were maybe 60 people in the
room, and people would rotate in and out with each new reader).  I read
some new poems, most of the recently-published "brushstrokes", some
autobiographical stuff about growing up in the suburbs listening to punk
rock, and finished with "Oxygen" from DRUGS.  It was 2 am and I was beat,
and I had to work Sunday, so I had to leave.  Thus, I missed:

Ann Simon, Hung Tu, Fitz Schwartz, Braden Randall, Ed Ainsworth, Edmund
Berrigan, Adam DeGraff, Charles Foster, David Larsen, David Hayward, Gennui
Raffill, Alex Cory and Jay Schwartz, who was scheduled to be reading when
the sun rose at 5:57 am Sunday.  So I'm going to have to wait for the
documentary, too.

P.S.  Luckily I managed to get my work done early enough on Sunday to go to
Bob Gluck's house and celebrate Kevin Killian's new award-winning book.
Bob made an awesome strawberry shortbread and it was fun sitting out in his
tiered backyard which he gardens himself.  I was sure ready for a nap when
I got home from that, though.

Sorry, I (ahem) 'meant' to say something about Chris Mann's comment of a few
days ago, but hit 'Queue' by accident.  I hope you all charitably assumed this.

Chris Mann wrote, and I repeated:
>meaning is rather a compulsive act of charity bestowed by an audient (not
>the same thing (and it is probably this not-sameness that is poetry
>(voice is just another way of saying oops)))

All I was going to say is that this sounds a lot like Donald (not Daniel)
Davidson, or some other philosopher of language who doubts the possibility
of accounting for utterer's meaning in terms of linguistic meaning. But the
assumption that meaning has nothing to do with intention and everything to
do with 'charity' is, to my mind, far too simple.  Better to say that
meaning comes from a (stunningly) complex relationship between what the
speaker/writer 'meant to' say and how the audient interprets the
words/conventional signs which the speaker/writer uses for this purpose.
Several papers in Paul Grice's -Studies in the Way of Words- are among the
more interesting and intellectually honest attempts in recent philosophy to
understand this relationship.

The above has more to do with conversation than with the literary text, in
which more is up for grabs.  But even here, the 'intentional fallacy' is
-not- that the author had some intentions, but that the author's intentions
are the final arbiter for what is 'in' the text.

By the way, the 'Bad Writing Contest' Associated Press article reminds me of
those filler items that used to appear in -The National Enquirer- describing
federally funded scientific studies in shocked-and-amazed terms.  "Your Tax
Dollars Used To Study Cow Flatulence" and the like.  Hey, someone's doing
something I don't understand immediately, it must be bullshit!

Friday, May 16th there was a reading at the Hotel Rex in San Francisco
featuring Sally Doyle, Ann Guy and Michelle Murphy.

The Hotel Rex is a Hotel Algonquin-style place near Union Square.  There
were canapes (no mere nosh, mind you--little processed turkey slabs rolled
up and skewered with toothpicks!) and most everyone was dressed up like
society folk.  Michelle Murphy introduced Sally Doyle, who talked about how
hot it was:  "I thought, 'It's too hot for words.'  And then I went, 'Oh
no!'" and about a recent dream in which she had angrily told a man, "Stars
aren't stupid--they're brilliant!"  Then she read some poems and a section
of her novel in progress which is about losing her mother.  Lines, you ask?
 Observe:

and to think they were transporting this field through the mail
even my walking was startled
the objects collide with me and make a drama

Sally introduced Ann Guy, who read several poems which seemed to echo with
the influence of Gary Snyder (for its relation to the natural world) and
Barbara Guest (for its thoughtful precision of syntax).  one of her poems
was called "Inside the Penumbra", which may give some impression, but if
not, here's more:

I rest my hope in its tilt
closing off the Pleiades to hammer down the roof
this assumption that once born you have a life worn only by you
that image of the fox in the laundry basket recurred

Ann then introduced Michelle, who brought us around full circle with some
old and some new work:

I shake whole syllables from my spine, stutter in what remains
not what I meant to say, but nothing else was handy
snarled as the fence posts that try to hold down the land
whose arms are wide enough to keep the whole horizon from falling?
what kind of crazy bird leaned into its wings and granted this hour?
like dice thrown over the blackest of felt

I didn't know about three-quarters of the attendees (Michelle said a lot of
her friends and family were there), but there was Joseph Aukee, Adam
Cornford, Thoreau Lovell, Cheryl Burket, Andrew Joron, and Robin
Trembley-McGaw (if I'm not mistaken), Ann's husband George, and a Lori (or
Laurie) whose last name I didn't get who was on crutches.

let's not also forget the ridiculous posturings of self-appointed
chief arbiter-of-"bad"-academic-prose, denis dutton.  i lurked for quite a
while on the phil-lit email list until the strong-arm moderating tactics
and frequent theory-bashing began to reflect in less subtle ways the
general tenor of the journal which dutton edits, _philosophy and
literature_ (a recent issue of which was largely devoted to publishing
proceedings from an annual alsc conference).

such talk of theory/jargon as marking "the death throes of english as an
academic discipline" -- strangely territorial, nay colonial, for a senior
lecturer in the philosophy of art who, if he is responsible for his own
copy-editing, can't spell jameson's first name right...

3) Does anybody know the HAPPY GENIUS email number...
I gotta contact this person too.
4). Don't worry Doug Messerli about sending the GERTY STEIN awards book. I

6. Don't worry baby about the Beach Boys they don't worry about the talking
heads who don't worry about the government and how it ripped off PHIL and
RONNIE SPECTER
7. DOn't worry about the specter of hobgoblins...
8. DO THINK about the specter in ARETHRA FRANKLIN'S REMAKE of "BORDER SONG"

Well, I regret the tone of my original post, condescending as it was, so I
also apologize [by the way, ritual apologies, I find, are highly formulaic
too -- don't you?].

I have no trouble with the analogy with Coltrane's "memorized riffs" [it
has frequently occurred to me, as well as to oral theorists like Paul
Zumthor]. But I fail to see how it contradicts my "theory" in any way. As
for the status of my truth-claims [or, rather, their lack of status in your
eyes], I have a certain respect for cultural, linguistic, and other forms
of relativity, and I acknowledge that truth-claims are often made
problematic by one's biases, bad attitudes, personal blinders, etc. But if
I have taken the trouble to read, no study, "Homer" in his own language, if
I have studied Homeric scholarship, if I have done all that philology
stuff, all that linguistics stuff, etc., etc., don't you think that my
chances [to turn to probability theory] are a *little* better at
approximating "the truth", than someone else's who hasn't made that effort?
I think that an imaginative leap informed by relevant geography is much
more likely to have a good landing than a blind leap of faith.  That's just
a hunch, though.

Actually, I don't consider myself a Classicist, and I don't like them much
either.  But if we are going to pit the scholar against the poet, I think
it would be wise to resort to the one for what she can offer you, and to
the other for what she can offer you.

But I'm not here to get into a debate about what poets are good for.  I
joined this list, to tell the truth [not that I have any special claims on
it], because I am a Vedicist working on Vedic poetics. I have found that
Vedic studies is a kind of intellectual backwater when it comes to poetics.
So I have resorted to this list, as I would to someone who might be able to
help me with my car, or my broken arm, or my near-sightedness, or my
plumbing. Yes, plumbers are very imaginative too, about certain things.

News is gossip [does anyone know the etymology of gossip?]. If no one will
be reading M. Parry in 500 it will because his science will have made
progress in those years, by standing on his as well as on many other
shoulders. So, who's being condescending now?

I assume your question is rhetorical, but I'll answer it anyway:
it's from the old English _godsibb_, a person spiritually related to
god, having to do with godparents. My point exactly.

Actually, I love classicists and I love that discourse, so I wasn't
putting them down at all. They have provided me with much imaginative
material over the years. I still read Jane Ellen Harrison and F.M.
Cornford with great pleasure (as did H.D. who worked some of their
material into her epic, _Helen in Egypt_), tho that shows you how out
of touch I am. Sorry if it sounded like I was putting down philology.
I think I was  still responding to what I found troubling in your
original post. My point was not to put down that scholarship, but to
assert that it too originates with a Muse.

It's exactly your notion of "progress" that I find problematic, with
it's implication that what comes later is somehow closer to truth (in
your metaphor that's an upward movement--standing on shoulders,
etc.--so we're maybe back to gossip as the embodiment of knowledge).

I see it more as the passage of fashions, as a concurrent thread on
this list recently had it. Even the real "sciences" are coming to
understand that the accumulation of data leads not to progress but to
discontinuous rupture--Thomas Kuhn's proposal about the revolutions in
in the cosmologies that found "scientific" thinking. More likely
people will read Parry for the "historiography"-- that "back then,
because of x conditions, people actually believed this."

Best,
Mike

I really think that most people subbed to the poetics list are actually
"set no mail" and will probably never receive this. It would be
interesting to do a roll call.

As the custodial crewman designed to sustain healthy list operations, I
feel it is my duty to report the following. I will be leaving Buffalo for
the summer and until I get an e-mail address in East Lansing, Michigan, I
will be hard to reach via email. My current address will still be
functioning and eventually all mail sent to this address will find me in
Michigan. I will be able to log in in the interim, via long-distance, in
the interim. Perhaps it will be only a few days. I'm not really sure. I've
lived in Buffalo since 1992 and one might say that it is my whole world.
(not the school, but the city). I hope to get work done on my dissertation
and get caught up on the Meow Press activities. If anyone out there lives
in the vicinity of East Lansing, or Ann Arbor (I will be researching at
the Labadie Collection at U of M) or Detroit, and would like to trade
endless poetics gossip, let me know back channel (and be patient for my
response may be slow...).

Hopefully there will not be much of a lag in the poetics mop-up I do
around here daily. Please, keep short chatterbox messages to a minimum.
Backchannel whenever possible. Consider your posts and perhaps write them
off-line, posting longer pieces whenever possible. Sorry to nag, but you
don't want to ruin it for everyone!

i didn't mean humanist as a putdown. just thought it important to point out
that the judge was not exactly the "everyman" he was being justified as,
but rather someone from jameson's own neck of the woods who obviously felt
he had a mission  to clean up his territory and rescue it from scary young
turks.  i.e. he's a professional scholar, just like jameson, and the degree
of generational ressentiment runs high here.

Mike,

You will never see me marching in any parade for progress.  I actually like
Kuhn, paradigm shifts, and all that.  My metaphor about shoulders is
actually a *cliche* intended to express a little humility, a gesture of
respect, toward a scholar who has changed the way that some of us, at
least, see epic. Presumably such gestures can be made without being
scientistic. I don't want to be steered into making absolute statements
about anything so large as "truth"....

Actually, in many ways my views are more like yours than they are like
those of classicists [insofar as classicists tend to share views of
poetics].

But let's take a closer look at your last remark about the
historiographical interest that people might have in Parry in 500 yrs. Two
things. My first reaction to the question of what people will be reading
then is that they probably won't be reading at all [and I'm not saying that
*that* would be progress, or not]. But since I myself have no interest in
anybody's "imperishable fame", it didn't seem to me to matter, either way.

But yr. remark suggests to me that in 500 yrs people will have *only* an
historical interest in scholars like Parry ["back then, because of x
conditions, people actually believed this..."]. The remark implies that in
fact you *don't* view all fashions as equally "news". Some beliefs, tied to
some time and place now remote and forgotten, actually will die. So perhaps
we both operate with some vague notion of "progress" after all?

Except, I think that ultimately all beliefs will die [this is the long view
that I picked up from the Upanishads].

From here on I will try to stick to poetics.

Begging the list's indulgence [I'll try not to take up so much of your
time], and btw thanks for the generous welcome.

George

I wanted to do this, but each time I re-read Jameson's sentence I felt that
much less capable.


109. ...And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be
anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all
*explanation*, and a description alone must take its place. And this
description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the
philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems; they
are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that
in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: *in despite of* an
urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new
information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a
battle against the betwitchment of our intelligence by means of language.

About Malley and his creators (see quote below)--

Well, yes, their intention WAS to pass off something they considered
rubbish...The point was to badly embarrass Max Harris and "demonstrate"
that the surrealist-influenced work he wrote and championed, because it
was not more conservative in form, tone and intention, had no *fixed
point* from which good and bad could be discerned.  You have to remember
just HOW conservative (in most senses) the mileu was, in which all of this
was taking place.  In the final analysis, the hoaxers seem to have kind of
wanted to demolish Harris publicaly, yet not really wanted him to
precisely go away or to be personally devastated. In the event, he WAS
devastated and quit writing poetry and being involved in the poetry world
in large part, and the Australian state (to the horror of the hoaxers) was
stimulated by the publicity to try Harris and his magazine for obscenity
(on the grounds of the mildest imaginable incidental erotic references in
poems whose point was not erotic at all...the prosecution was truly
something out the 19th century).  And yes, the fact that many people
continue to admire the poems the hoaxers produced in one afternoon to
"demonstrate" that surrealist-tinged work was silly, has been considered
by many to have been a kind of "failure" for the hoax..Its immediate
impact was both wildly successful and complexly unsuccessful...in that the
hoaxers seem genuinely not to have wanted to cause as much personal pain
and persecution for Harris and several of his associates, as they did.

People should read Malley's poems, by the way.  Apart from being very
interesting and rather good in a weird way, they make one point clear:
Just what was at stake **then** cannot be easily recovered in any
immediate sense for us in the U.S. today...I mean these "outrageous"
surrealist/modernist texts are **pretty mild**....I shudder to think what
the Australians of that time would have done if confronted with Clark
Coolidge or Susan Howe...As for work that existed in 1942, well Zukofsky
and Stein and such simply were not part of the same universe; most of the
principles in the case would have agreed that such work was beyond the
pale!  Not that there aren't losts of important parallels to Yasusada and
other contemporary events, parallels that are geniunely interesting and
important...But the precise battle of modernists and anti-modernists that
was the original origin of the Malley affair, is very distant from our own
time and place.

I'd like to propose a new term for the list's consideration:

the etymological fallacy--a. that two words wrom the same root continue to
mean the same thing.
b. that a word retains the meaning of its root.

Here's a recent example of a.: sensible and sensitive. Example: "I was
starving, your honor. In my situation stealing your wife's purse was the
sensible thing to do."
Substitute sensitive.

And here's an example of b.: epic as gossip.

well if there's an opening for an epic columnist, let me know

d.i.

p.s.: last night, happily caught the made-for-TV production of the gab
from that epic-monger, Homer --

p.p.s.:  question for George T. -- is your "Vedic" research primarily
focused on (a) what are usually called the Vedic Hymns? -- or might it
also include (b) the (I believe somewhat later & various) body of
Upanishadic material? (which presumably are also "Vedic"(?) -- though,
in Hinduism, distinquished as "Vedanta").  There'd be quite a difference
between (a) & (b) -- from what I've seen in translation & discussion.  If
inclusive of the Upanishads, then your focus would include a good bit of
narrative and storytelling and conversational utterance & philosophical
statement; but if more strictly dealing with the former, then the focus
would largely (so far as I know) center on (what's sometimes called)
"vatic" utterance: mantric invocation of all the various divine figures and
celebration of their attributes . . . . -- The distinction seems of interest, in
context of some of these ongoing discussions.

        I'd like to second the positive notice of Cydney Chadwick's new
chapbook from 3300 Press, INTERIORS. Cydney has quietly but surely been
building up quite a collection of short fictions remarkable for their
precision and cunning. Her work frequently features characters put through
a process of destabilization which would be easy to miss because of the
apparent but deceptive straightforwardness of their narrative surface.
This attention to surface and its destabilization reminds me of the work
of Lydia Davis. Cydney is able to take seemingly ordinary situations and
invest them with sinister angles and a sense, almost, of the
existential--the characters find themselves removed from the terms of
their own ordinary understandings of the world. Some of the stories
feature minor grostequeries which shock not so much because of their
oddness but because they finally do not seem odd. I highly recommend this
new book--check out the story of what happens to people who come to the
hotel where Kleist and a friend committed suicide.

A good proposal, Mark, but not a new one, at least for us philologists, who
wrestle with this fallacy all the time.  But it calls for some precision.

Now, if I had argued that the Greek word "epos" means "hymn" *merely*
because its Vedic cognate "vacas" means "hymn -- *that* would be an example
of the etymological fallacy, type b. But how do you find out whether this
is actually a fallacy or not?  Well, a philologist would go straight to the
relevant texts themselves, and closely examine the contexts in which the
word "epos" occurs, say in Homer, or Aristotle, or even the scholiasts.

You know what?  A philologist who did that would find that in fact the word
"epos" *can* mean something like "hymn" sometimes [e.g., in Homer, Pindar].
In the scholiasts the word "epos" is used to introduce Homeric passages
[so it means "epic words" there], but also Homeric hymns [therefore "hymn"
also].  So sometimes etymological "fallacies" can lead to historical
truths.

But your example b is not an etymological fallacy, type b. There is no
etymological relationship between "epic" and "gossip", and none was
claimed. What I was suggesting with my rhetorical question [yes, MB, you
read it right] was that the suggestion "epic" = "gossip" might be less
irritating if we considered the earlier sense of "gossip". "Godsibb" also
had to to with midwives and their secondary function of bringing the news,
which by the way is how the word got its negative connotations -- "women's
epic" [as a philologist, I checked this out in the OED].

Has the meaning of the word "gossip" changed over the centuries?  Sure.
But I'd like to change it yet again [in a circle].  And I would recommend a
new, popular book: "Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language" by
Robin Dunbar [who by the way did not take advantage of the word's
etymology].

Epic is gossip, gossip is epic. My mantra for now.

In philosophical/rhetorical theory this is known as the "genetic fallacy"
-- that the origin of a word is necessarily related to its current usage
-- & goes back at least as far as Wimsatt/Beardsley (you know, the
"pathetic fallacy," etc. etc.). There are others but I'm too witless at
the moment to make up ones funny enough to pass my internal censor.

c. two words seen as related because, although they come from different
roots, they once meant different things than they do now; these earlier
meanings, because they may converge, might lead an observer to think that
their meanings are still related. When such a relationship is stated baldly
it tends both to obscure meaning and to discount the historical trajectory
of the terms by favoring a presumed origin.

Thanks for helping me be more precise.

*** (from mercury news) France's Le Pen swears in talking postcard

France's extreme-right National Front launched a talking postcard
Monday in which anti-immigration crusader Jean-Marie Le Pen swears at
voters in an election campaign gimmick. The party plans to distribute
the postcards in cafes and bars ahead of next Sunday's first round of
a parliamentary election. When the card is pressed, a recording of Le
Pen's voice says: "What about France, goddammit? Do you think about
it? It's high time. Tomorrow will be too late. So go to the polls,

1.  I'm getting POETICS via DIGEST again.  But this time around, the broken
lines between messages no longer show up.  The lists I get in DIGEST form
here at Arizona (I mean the ones emanating from the Arizona listerv) still
have the lines between messages to make it easy to tell one message from
another (as POETICS used to); but POETICS is all run together, making it
pretty confusing to follow the day's posts.

Is this fixable?  Or am I the only one w the problem?

I read poetics via Eudora Pro.

2.  on a much happier note: POG, kind of the Tucson local chapter of
POETICS, recently sponsored (barely: it was pretty much pro bono on David's
part) a really wonderful mini-residency by David Bromige (hi David):
terrific talk on how poems (might) get generated, wonderful reading the next
day; general good talk all around.

So thanks to David for the terrific poetry stint!

In case no one has answered this: it's Rabbi Tarfon, as quoted in
Pirkei Avot 2:20. (The book can be found in English variously as
"Sayings of the Fathers" or "Ethics of the Fathers" or, in Rami
Shapiro's beautiful recent translation, as "Wisdom of the Jewish Sages".

Of course this kind of thing makes one wince, but can it be avoided? Judges
are poets, poets teach, teachers have students, and those students apply
for bucks from judges. It would be unreasonable to expect that all the work
in those mss would be completely unfamiliar to every judge every year.

And Jorie directed my MFA thesis, served as my Teaching Advisor and I still
work with her as I am doing a Ph.D. here and I DIDN'T get an NEA in that
same round.  Or a book contract.  Or a free lunch.  Or coupons good for a
free career.  So much for The Great Iowa Conspiracy (we also control the
oil market and NASDAQ by the way).  Think it's time for me to exit the
poetics list if I need to be slogging through this.  Hoped it would have
been better.

i'm not especially in favor of defending jameson or explaining his

fairly admiring terms not too long ago.  I, for one, have a good
opinion of her as a poet, and not a bad one as a figure in the
evanescent game of publishing / critique courtship behavior.

One thought that at some point could use exploring -- this follows
from Kent Johnson's remarks (and Kevin Killian's excellent &
interesting insert-quoted response) -- is this: the tendency to
bifurcate the poetry universe (to construe the world of writers into
what are imagined as opposing camps) is often a strong one, and no
doubt it has a rather archetypal imperative behind it.  Nonetheless,
it can be an incideous urge in certain respects.  It is not above
critique -- indeed, the illusory nature of what are, for a time, felt
to be "established" and "obvious" bifurcations of this type, is, I
dare say, worth considering.

that I've ceased bothering trying to get my stuff in print -- and
might simply web-publish myself at some point) . . . I've a good
opinion of much work issuing from writers in both alleged "camps" and

A former NEA Fellow, I'm arriving at the conclusion that the NEA is
becomming irrelevant--at least for individual artists, even in the
literature program, the last that gives them grants--but not because of
cronyism. I don't know about the Michelle Glazer case, but I'd like to
see some actual documented cases of "incest" before we go charging off
in search of people to tar and feather. The NEA has become irrelevant
because the amount of money it can spend is so paltry--it's been driven
out of the economic culture at the same time it has tried to preserve
its status by moving aesthetically to the middle of the road. The enemy,
friends, is not Michelle Glazer or even Jorie Graham, but Dick Armey and
Jessie Helms and the Christian right. By the way, I deserved every cent
they gave me!

instead of crying "corruption! nepotism!" why not imagine that: the winner
deserved the award 2) the friend of the winner who was a judge kept a low
profile during the discussion,esp if s/he had written a letter of reference
3) the same thing could be said to happen in any network of poets.  it is,
for example, an absurd rule in some academic departments that, in order to
guard against nepotism or conflic of interest, assistant professors coming
up for tenure may not have as their external reviewers anyone they have met
or had any interaction with.  however, if the goal is to have a national
profile, and the reviewers are the top people in the candidate's field,
this is directly punitive to those young faculty members who do have a
national profile and are visible in their professional networks. let's get
real.

Actually, many such cases of "incest" were documented in detail by  Hilary
Masters in _The Georgia Review_, Summer 1981, in his essay "Go Down
Dignified: The NEA Writing Fellowships" (followed, by the way, with a
response from David Wilk, then Literature Program Director). This piece
stirred up a great deal of controversy at the time; it reported -- naming
some names, no less -- several sordid stories about cronyism. What's really
interesting, though, is how Masters reserved his sharpest machete for the
then-fledgling Language Poets, beating up on folks like Hejinian, Watten,
Bill Berkson, Anne Waldman, etc., alleging some kind of conspiracy. No, Mr.
Duemer, the incest was there, is there, and will always be there, but to
most of us cronyism is a fact of life in just about any aspect of social
interaction you can name; it's a given, and I'd agree with you that it's
foolish to waste time and energy bitching about it when we could be writing
exciting poetry that earns attention no matter who we are.

A positive story... I remember hearing that some years ago the NY State
Foundation for the Arts rejected a poetry fellowship applicant's work
because it "sounded too much like Ashbery."  After the process was over the
panel was amazed to discover that the rejected applicant was indeed Ashbery
himself.  That says something good about NY's process, if not something
about the kind of work JA was writing at the time.


One more note on this subject.  To me the cash award of an NEA fellowship
is beside the point; what it really represents -- as Masters points out --
is an imprimatur, a badge that says your peers think you're one helluva
poet, an honor that even non-poet tenure committees understand.  Lately
I've been thinking that the NEA should drop the money award to writers and
just give the winners some kind of framed certificate or medal. Then maybe
some of the saved bucks could be used to reinstitute grants for painters
and sculptors, who at least can use the money for materials.

The *materials* could be useful, too, in themselves... a nice frame and a

physical materials of the award.

Seems like cronyism should not be considered a fact of life.  The fact that
poets form groups & make friends is a VERY good thing; but awards, grants,
etc. should TRY to avoid nepotism in order to provide the ONE thing of value
they could provide: a relatively anonymous, chancy, recognition of value.
I know at least SOME journals try to maintain this approach in their
editorial decisions; grants & awards should do the same.

I know that since I began writing myself the idea of being at the behest
of some mentor, teacher, or friend's concept of whether what I was doing was
good or not simply throws the whole creative process out of whack. You
need a measure (immeasurable?) of independent subjectivity.  But it can
be different for beginning writers, I know.  This is one of those paradoxes
the more you talk about it the less you feel or understand.  Poetry for
me though has always been under the sign of total anarchy & independence
(believe it or not, gentle readers).  In dialectic with basic literary
education.  But at the beginning, yeah, a few enthusiastic informed readers
sure helps...

Let's go back to the WPA.  Writers, poets, painters, musicians get the hell
to work, you all get minimum wage & you all get paid, no judges, no cliques,
no prestige, let the people judge.  & no darn abstract regionalism!!

One way to look at it is to look at the distinction between private and public
life, and what problems can occur when the two are interchanged. One could also
see the search for new subject matter, perhaps even a vampirizing of the
suffering of others in a growing number of contemporary works. Subject matter
is not what poetry is made of. Right? However we are seeing a great deal of
thinking that personal tragedy or suffering is unique, and that it privileges
the speaker, and worse yet, that it is news.

I was at a bookstore reading of "Kyrie" by Ellen Voigt here in Ft.Lauderdale
when someone asked her if she had somehow been connected to the Spanish
influenza. Her unapologetic response was that she had no family history of the
Spanish flu, but that she was interested in the life stories of those she
researched. What I noted in the question was a common public demand for
authority, for personal ownership of experience, tragedy or suffering. Since
she later spoke with me about poetry that finds a resonance in the reader, I
gathered that she intended to dwell on the human condition of suffering, as
well as death, and that the Spanish flu was just her vehicle or source. I don't
know if it was meant to justify the book or not. It seems to me that reviewers
remarks frequently play up such points though as if to justify a book.

Best,

Bill B.

Thanks Mark P (and Steve C backchannel) for verifying that if not out and
out malicious the Ern Malley conspirators were hostile to modernism _in
general_ and not merely to the insufficient examples of modernism Max
Harris was peddling (no Australians will speak to this?). Haven't been
able to enjoy the Yasusada hoax for similar reasons -- too hostile a move
to be worth appreciating -- hostile not merely to the magazines involved
nor even to the 'poetry community' whatever you think it is but to
sympathy _in general_.

Was surprised at "The Incredible Shrinking Man" the other night to hear
Gastr del Sol's 'Our exquisite replica of "eternity"' as the opening theme
or obviously vice versa, gds borrowed the theme for the song -- is this
the kind of thing I should be reading zines to know about?

Is it so important to know all the sources and roots? is it so important
to know what tones people are taking (toward _you_ -- or _the system_)?

I have to agree with Maria Damon here.  Often on these kinds of panels,
panelists must disqualify themselves for any number of reasons-- you know
the editors (I served on a magazine panel), you've been in the magazine,
etc.  Thus while other less sypathetic people stay and decide if $$ should
go to worthy contenders, you're out in the hallway twiddling your thumbs
and when you see what happened in your absence, you're not even able to
comment!  I found it a very frustrating and peculiar experience, to be
able to exert no power in advocating the aesthetic I might have
represented on that panel.

Well, here's what you can learn for $185.  I've always thought the whole
voice thing has more to do with "brand recognition" than anything
else...protecting your own "look and feel" against the competition.
Then, even if you leave your name off the ms., the judges will know who
you are.

Finding Your Unique Voice:
A Two-Day Workshop
X 448.10A  English 1.5 Units    $185

Just as every human being has a unique personality, every writer
has--potentially--a unique voice through which his/her vision may
be best expressed.  Designed to help beginning and established
writers discover/develop that voice, this workshop includes
exercises to discover personal patterns of diction and imagery,
dissolve blocks, recover lost memories, tap into the individual
wellsprings of creativity, and explore personal mythologies.
Participants also study selected writers to determine what
constitutes a "style" and read student works in a supportive
atmosphere.  Through active and playful class participation, each
student learns how to listen for his/her own writing voice and
let it emerge. (Enrollment limited to 30 students.)

What a bizarre notion that writers have no costs for materials (like what
about computer equipment, books, a desk chair that doesn't cripple you),
that they need no money to write.  What about the old cliche "Time is
money."  What about not having to work two jobs for a few months, or not
having to take on yet another stupid journalism assignment--I think that
money would certainly make a difference in any writer's ability to produce
work.

Well, though I didn't say that writers have *no* costs -- you're
extrapolating from my statement quite a bit here -- I do think that visual
artists have more expenses directly related to the production of their
work. If you talk to painters you know how insanely expensive paints,
canvas, brushes, studio rental, etc., are. Talk about bizarre.  Certainly,
writers can use NEA money in a variety of ways that can help them --
including things like travel and time off from the job. But I'm sorry if I
don't quite feel your pain, having worked 8-5 with very limited vacation
time for more than 20 years and written hundreds of poems anyway,
uncomfortable chair and all.  An NEA would buy some time I'd love to have,
but who can wait for that cold day in hell?

When I talk about "materials," I'm talking about the very basics that
visual artists need simply to get their ideas out in a tangible form.
While a computer can certainly make life easier, plenty of poets are still
writing poems without them, and many of those who apply for and receive
NEAs are -- let's face it -- teachers who already have access to computers,
pencils, paper, typewriters, even free postage! etc. via their departments,
not to mention 3-4 month sabbaticals every few years.  My point was that it
made little sense to me for the NEA to cut off visual artists from
fellowships while sparing writers, though I can see how it would make sense
to Helms -- it's a lot harder to spot that there porno when there's all
them little words all around it.

Also -- I know poets who would kill for a "stupid journalism assignment"
now and then.  It's writing and you get paid for it -- another bizarre
notion!

In search of a cheap, comfortable desk chair myself,

Jordan, the sources and roots are important only as handshakes (or
connecting flights) but I wonder if they're more substantial than that.
Gastr del Sol is always incredibly shrinking; the zines typically do two
things: a) they chart the data (Punk, Louisville, Chicago,
Brains, Classical, Eyeglasses), or, b) they state flatly "this group makes
difficult music." Does it go further than that? I don't know. Zines are
ambience and digestibility. Without zines, what would GdS or Red Krayola
or Brise Glace or Merzbow, what would any such stuff be (not that any of
these groups are similar or equal)? Does the poetry world have the
equivalent of zines (which don't serve the same functions as journals)?
Besides the Poetry Project Newsletter? I'm ignorant and curious.

There seems to be an attitude among funders that all writing (and art) is

Having had a lot of contact with the science world, I feel that grants and
awards (not to mention accepting material for publication) could very
usefully be done in the same way for poetry as it is in much of
science--the typescript to be evaluated is "blinded" by the editor, and
reviewed by a reviewer who has no name, only the work, to judge.  In
recent debates in science, folks have pointed out that in small
specialized areas (and a lot of science now falls out into small
specialized areas!!) a reviewer often knows from the work itself that
this is X or Y, since only X or Y is modelling growth rates in termite
populations in Uganda.  The same thing would happen in
poetry--some judges would guess that this poem had been submitted by Alice
Fulton or Charles Bernstein or Will Alexander 'cause it *sounds* like that
person...But on the whole, having to respond to the work without knowing
"who" the poet is is an interesting exercise..Hopefully everyone on the
list reads Antenym (if you don't, you should)..That magazine sets up the
work so that unless you spend some time and energy first with the table of
contents, you don't know the poet's name, you just encounter the poem.  It
is a very interesting experience to not have (to be allowed to have) any
preconceptions.

It's true, and this unfortunately pervasive linkage to social utility
governed the recent NEA restructuring as well.  Regardless of one's views
of public support of the arts or of the NEA itself, it should be noted
that individual grants to writers were continued because a consortium of
writers' organizations (CLMP, Poets & Writers, etc.) hired a Washington
lobbyist and set continuation of such fellowships as a priority.
Organizations representing the visual arts seemed to be more focussed on
institutional funding.  As a further point of information, the NEA rule
governing panelists' special interests is the "no love, hate, blood or
money" rule, whereby a panelist is supposed to excuse him/herself if any
of these apply.

Response to Mark Prejsnar's comments on Antenym:

I agree with you about Antenym's format.  I like the way the name is less
important than the work and I would just mention that a new journal coming
out of Atlanta (where you are, I take it) called Syntactics is promising a
similar format.
Editor: John Lowther.  Having said that, I would mention that I've been told
it is coming out this month and that there are some "names" in the first
issue, like Ray DiPalma, and Bernstein too (if I'm not mistaken).

I'm with Maria Damon and Maxine Chernoff about nobly recusing oneself as
an arts judge to avoid the horror of "conflict of interest": I'm against
it.  Seems to me if judges consider only work whose authors they don't
know, they'll only consider work they're incompetent to judge--because
they'll be dealing with schools of poetry they haven't studied
sufficiently to recognize the work of everyone of consequence in.

But arts competitions are like all the rest of life: the prizes go to
the credentialed while personal satisfaction goes to the productive.

It's probably a waste of time trying to do anything about it;
nonetheless, here's one suggestion, a follow-up to David R. Israel's
comment about how he's seriously thinking about web-siting his poetry:
junk the NEA and use the funds saved to buy web-sites for randomly-
selected poets--and other artists (and critics).  A government-funded
universal index to artwork and art-criticism on the internet would be
nice, too.

Hello from a lurker:

Living in South Florida, where innovative poetries & poets are few & far
between, I've been thinking a lot about poetic communities, largely
spurred by Ron Silliman's frequent published comments on the importance
of community for poetics-formation and by what seems my own isolation
here (save of course for one or two people who want to talk the same
language).  The List, on one level is a great thing, and it's very
heartening to see the reading series and publications happening all
around; on another level, it makes me long for what I'd known during
graduate school and when I lived in the DC area--a group of lively and
verbal writers with whom one could interact in an immediate way.  I'm
sure many of us on the list know this feeling, especially those who are
far from urban centers, or who live in endless suburban wastelands like I
do.  I'm wondering about ways that others have found to establish
communities, perhaps from the ground up.  Any fruitful suggestions?

And more specifically--there've GOT to be more listmembers than just Bill
Burmeister and me in South Florida; it's hard to tell who's where from
just a printout of listmembers with e-mail addresses.  Those of you out
there in West Palm Beach, Broward, Dade, and counties surrounding, could
you please backchannel me?
With delurking blushes,
Mark Scroggins

I agree with almost everything this thread has said so far. But it's also
important to remember, isn't it, that making poems or painting or music or
what have you operates remarkably well outside of standard economies. And
this goes both for creation and reception.Not a hell of a lot of money--if
any-- is NEEDED: I'd be if not the first right up there if they were
offering it, but that has more to do with wanting a) the recognition (as
mentioned earlier in this thread) and b) to "get paid" for something I'm
doing anyway, rather than only for something I do BECAUSE it pays.
I don't think getting paid (via grants, or per word by a publisher, what
have you) is equivalent to "selling out"--in the eyes of the writer: but it
usually is in the mind of the buyer.

The Endowment still awards writing fellowships while dropping them from
other programs because several literary organizations lobbied long & hard
for it.

Since support for individual artists has often been the best place for
conservatives to look for "controversial" work to rouse the rabble against
government funding for the arts, expect to see more, not less, complaints
about writers in the coming months.

Not having read the Masters article, I can tell you some of how and why
this works at the Endowment as well as other funding agencies public and
private, and why  it may not be a bad thing.  I've worked for more than a
dozen years writing grants for arts organizations & have about a dozen
years of the NEA's annual reports, so I'm not just working from anecdotal
evidence here, I've seen the figures.

NO writer doing experimental work EVER gets funded in years when there is
no writer sympathetic to that kind of work on the panel.  A group of
writers who work in the "workshop" or "new formalist" modes are not going
to be persuaded by an example of "language writing" or any else, when
there's no one to argue in favor of its merits.  Since the panels so rarely
have representatives from this area of the field, the effect is pretty
obvious.  It was the same thing for composer fellowships, no one with a
"downtown" style got funded except in the few years there were like-minded
panelists on the selection committee.

Is this cronyism or a difference of aesthetics?  Most of the complaints
I've seen about "avant garde" cronyism on panels like these boil down to
"hey, fewer of my favorite kind of writers got support this year, cause of
a few opiniated avant garde cronies who couldn't tell GOOD writing if it
bit them on the ass."

For what it's worth, panelists at the NEA & all other public-supported
agencies are supposed to announce conflicts of interest, & may have to
recuse themselves from considering works by friends, lovers, bosses,
plaintiffs, etc.  How this is implemented on fellowship panels with
allegedly "blind" judging can get a little, uh, questionable, though.
After all, who's to say whether someone REALLY didn't recognize work before
the names get put on for the final rankings?

This anecdote is probably an urban legend, as I've heard it about virtually
every artistic discipline in which "blind" judging is used.

By this logic, the artists who should be funded are not painters and
sculptors but media & computer artists whose expenses are even greater.

As a former, & founding, board member of a local private organization that
supports indivdual artists (in Washington state only), I'd say that
fellowships are a form of peer recognition and while the money is
technically provided to buy time for artists, if they buy a car or make a
down payment on a house that they wouldn't otherwise buy, I don't think
it's a bad thing.

Painters & sculptors work within an economic structure in which they MAY be
able to sell their work for a figure that reflects the time and materials
that went into it.  Few writers, and fewer poets, have the same
opportunities.  & because of this, there are more instances of visual
artists who "can afford to work without it" getting fellowships than
writers.

The NEA, with AmeriCorps and local arts agencies-- and in its first year with
AWP, *has* sponsered a project like the WPA called WritersCorps, for the last
three years.

WritersCorps is based in San Francisco, DC and the Bronx (although I believe the
NY branch is working without fed. dollars in their third year).  Since I worked
for WritersCorps in CA for two years, I can personally attest for the near
minimum wage-- although you do get an educational voucher for several thousands
and your student loans go in forbearance.  Of course cliques are involved-- it
is a group of people after-all-- some prestige and perks too-- we had goldfish
crackers as treats for some of our meetings (and I got to accompany one of my
students to the White House and met the first Lady!).

In San Francisco we worked with inner city youth-- it was tough and great-- I
loved "my" kids hugely, it was fun, we got to know each other-- they were good
poets.  Two anthologies to check out:  "Flavors of the City" and "Word from the
(415)" featuring  work SF WritersCorps' Youth wrote in '95 and '96, the latter
book includes some lesson plans.  The third anthology is at the printers now.
All are available through Small Press Distribution.

Bob Grumman writes,

<< here's one suggestion, a follow-up to David R. Israel's comment about
how he's seriously thinking about web-siting his poetry: junk the NEA
and use the funds saved to buy web-sites for randomly- selected
poets--and other artists (and critics).  A government-funded universal
index to artwork and art-criticism on the internet would be nice, too. >>

I've no response to these broad ideas, but will add a different, modest
remark.  My views about (or tentative stance re:) website "publication"
generally, and web-based self-publication in particular, were moved along
a notch by a conversation I had with a Berkeley writer a couple months
ago.  This woman is a Chinese novelist -- having written several novels in
modern Chinese, evidently of a somewhat experimentalist ilk (by
contemp. Chinese-fiction standards -- which frankly I wouldn't exactly
know . . .)  She encountered red lights all the way, so far as possibility of
publishing her books -- and found herself, after a time, discouraged.
Friends, however, suggested she self-publish on the web.  She did this
(via the SinoLogic website established by her husband, Dajuin Yao --
who, incidentally, also has some Chinese [& partly bilingual] "concrete
poetry" material on another branch of his SinoLogic site); -- and now the
novelist has the full text of several books online, for Chinese-literate
readers worldwide.

This writer remarked on an interesting advantage of web-publishing: it
serves to separate the distribution of one's work from mercantile forces.
Usual issues of commerce are simply nullified: one no longer needs to sell
books (or convince publishers to publish, distributors to distribute,
bookstores to stock, etc.)  Presto! -- the work is made directly available
(w/ obvious limitation: the reader must be a denizen of the online world,
and must know where to find the writer's work).

This interesting writer [pardon my vagueness -- her name is something
like Yueh-lian Wei (??), but I'd need to check . . .] commented further: she
has developed a devoted international readership, including readers who
await each new volume, read everything she writes, and directly offer
their informed critical feedback to her by email.  In short, she's managed,
via this technology, to connect with an intelligent & responsive
readership, circumventing commercial aspects of publishing.

(One might remark that such de-commercialization of art seems in
keeping with the old Chinese mores -- where, in days of yore, a serious
painter would be loathe to *sell* a painting, much favoring, say, staying
over at your home for a week or a month, and then giving you a painting
as a parting gift.  Kindred noncommercialism perhaps attended the
poetry world . . .  i.e., one didn't make money from poetry per se, albeit
poetry skills could indeed get one tenure [er, I mean, a job in Washington]
. . . ]  but I stray from my theme . . . )

This woman's remarks served to dislodge & perhaps dispose of certain
prejudices of mine (re: self-publication in general & web-publication in
particular).  By the time I left our shady afternoon chat, I found myself
starting to look favorably on such notions for my own tucked-away,
dust-gathering manuscripts.

My thoughts abt. this remain tentative & exploratory -- but I'm rather
hopeful that I might in fact find the web's waters (as they say) fine.

Subject:      China-po & money / Captain of Butterflies

pardon, a small postscript --

my idle remarks re: money & poetry in old China were perhaps flawed.
Certainly the noncommercial ideal was often prevalent for the so-called
"literati painters" (a remarkable brood of folk in, say, the Mongol [Yuan]
dynasty].  On the other hand, poets -- & musicians, etc. -- were of course
wined & dined & supported by the aristocracy in general & often  courts
in particular.

(Some problems of art & livelihood that we'all face are, no doubt, related
to some broad issues of democracy vs. aristocracy.  The NEA has tried
to fill those shoes, and seemingly did rather well for a nice stretch . . . )

d.i.

p.s.:  Sam Hamill's essay abt. Poetry & Money (in his Broken Moon
Press volume, *The Poet's Work*) presents some good (if familiar)
thoughts on this, more broadly.

p.p.s.:  Enjoyed Dutch writer Cees Nooteboom's reading in DC last
evening -- including a couple poems from Sun & Moon's volume *The
Captain of the Butterflies*, just out -- 1st time Nooteboom's poetry has
been presented in English.  He's best known for his novels, but also has
published some 11 poetry volumes in Dutch (& he has himself translated
a good bit of contemp. American poetry into Dutch, he remarked).

After a time (if nobody else happens to do so first), I might offer a few
remarks abt. *The Captain of the Butterflies*, which I'm enjoying.  The
translation is by Leondard Nathan & Herlinde Spahr.

I agree about Jameson. The judge, Dr.  Denis Dutton, (Doctor DeeDee)
edits an academic journal called Philosphy & Literature; he teaches
aesthetics to art school students at the University of Canterbury,
unfortunately. He's representatative of a breed of anglo-american
philosophers (Dr. DD is an American who has been here 10-15 years)
who feel their subject has been stolen from them by pretentious
people in other fields, and seeks ways to hit back. But he's also got
a good nose for what makes news--and this version of The World's Top
Ten Worst Dressed is just his kind of  thing--the journalists love
it. He has written a book on the Shroud of Turin, and  likes to
expose frauds of all kinds--people who bend spoons with mind
power,and so on. Christchurch, a small  city in the South Island once
had a vibrant intellectual culture, but these days is increasingly
occupied by the Duttons of the world.

I think much of this discussion hinges on ethics: specifically, where does
advocacy end and cronynism begin?  We all want to advocate the work of
writers we like and admire, and hope the same is done for us.  And it is
often upsetting (or nauseating) to see the work of writers we don't like or
admire get published, funded, employed because we think that writer has a
connection we are not privvy to.  I think the identifying value here is
"worth," although identifying it is tricky and sometimes hard to defend.
This sense of worth is often tangled up with personal tastes, and perhaps
it's the responsibility of editors and contest judges to disentagle it, if
this is possible.

I think advocacy is an essential value in poetry:  it supports and extends
communities, forming connections where none might otherwise exist.  There
are a lot of writers I would never have heard of if someone hadn't shoved
their work in my hands and say you ought to read this, or to put a larger
spin, if someone hadn't published their work or scheduled them for a
reading in my geography (and publicizing these events so I have chance to
attend).

Advocacy turns into cronyism when it operates as a closed, exclusive
activity, a form of literary bigotry, when factors other than, as Eliza
puts it, the work, come into play in your decisons.

It all boils down to the rules and ethics we keep and share, and they are
not always simple, hard and fast.  Are you publishing someone because
you're sleeping with them or because they can do a favor for you?  What if
the person you're sleeping with happens to be a better writer than you?

I co-edit a magazine, JackLeg, that operates on the exact opposite
principle of blind judging:  we only publish by invitation.  In some ways
it is inherently unfair:  we will not publish an unsolicited manuscript
from Joe or Betty Boop (there are plenty of magazines out there that will
publish the Boops, no matter how unknown they happen to be, if their work
is good (worthy) enough for publication).  We started the magazine because
a lot of writers (specifically in Chicago and Tucson) we knew were not
getting published who deserved to be (lots of magazines start this way).
We wanted the writers in those two cities to become aware of each others
work.  Some of the ethical concerns we had to deal with:  the other
co-editor is a grad student in an MFA program:  should we publish her
fellow grad students (we decided not to, because it would poison her
workshops).  How do we prevent our magazine from only turning into another
cronyistic operation (we decided not to publish authors more than once, and
to solicit our authors to find other people to publish).

I'm just curious about the use of the word "fallacy" here.  In order to
come to a judgment that the use of a word is fallacious with respect to its
meaning, doesn't one have to proceed from the assumption that the word has
a stable meaning against which individual uses of the word can be compared
to determine whether they're correct or incorrect?  And doesn't the
proposal rest on precisely the opposite assumption--that the word's meaning
changes over time, i.e., is unstable?

And, if I may just shunt over to take up Joseph Duemer's question about
Heidegger's _Poetry, Language, Thought_:  yes, Heidegger employs etymology
in this and throughout his work to tie his thinking on Being into an
investigation of language and the historicity of the language in which that
thinking take place.  Your use of the phrases "etymological reasoning" and
"based on etymology" make it sound to me as though Heidegger's thought
could then be evaluated on the accuracy of his philology, which I wouldn't
agree with.  Fanciful as they often are, Heidegger's etymologies
nonetheless open up realms of thinking about words that aren't available to
us if we insist on the primacy of a single stable denotative meaning for
the word, or if we deny the associative power that the word has within and
without its "own" language, or if we fail to account for the context in
which the word appears (meaning for whom?).  I guess I'm seconding
something George Thompson said and adding another term:  sometimes
etymological "fallacies" can lead to philosophical truths.

What Mark sees as the obscuring of meaning is often a strategy employed to
problematize meaning so that what may seem like the "obvious" meaning of a
word is no longer taken for granted.  The word is no longer transparent but
prismatic, bent into the component colors that are present within the white
light.

Over the years, Chax Press has accumulated a number of hand printed
broadsides, usually (but not always) printed for specific poetry readings
or poetry festival appearances. Generally, after the occasion passes, these
are rarely offered for sale except at open studio events, and then they are
generally sold for $10.

Some of these broadsides were printed by Chax Press, some by me in earlier
days (pre-1984) for Black Mesa Press. Some were our decision to print,
others printed at the request of Woodland Pattern Book Center or the Tucson
Poetry Festival.

But we are definitely in fundraising mode here for new projects, and I'd
like to offer the following broadsides and small folded printings.
Broadsides are generally rather difficult and sometimes expensive to pack
and send safely, which is why the prices here go down considerably if you
buy more than one.

Please send any email replies directly to Chax at chax@theriver.com  -- and
not to the poetics list. Or send orders with checks to
Chax Press
101 W. Sixth St., no. 6
Tucson, AZ  85701-1000

If you buy one (copy or item), the cost is $7.
If you buy two, the cost is $10.
If you buy three, the cost is $14.
If you buy four, the cost is $17.
If you buy five, the cost is $20, and we'll throw in a surprise as well
(probably a small pamphlet or book).
If you buy more than five, you'll get a good deal -- I promise.

Here's the list of what's available:

Jonathan Williams, from the book of days, An Enchiridion of Asps
David Miller, from The Break (with a drawing actually drawn on each
broadside by Cynthia Miller)
Paul Metcalf, The Players (this is an announcement for a play performance,
but not the text of the play -- but a nice handprinted piece with a vintage
baseball image on it)
Pauline Oliveros, Horse Sings from Cloud
Karl Gartung, "I was pregnant . . ."
Edward Dorn, Maximum Ostentation
Joel Oppenheimer, For Max & Ted Berrigan (two poems both printed on the
broadside)
Clark Coolidge, Mammoth Night
Karen Brennan, Poetry, Language, Thought
Create Culture -- general broadside from Chax Press with image/word play
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Tan Tien
Gwendolyn Brooks, First Sermon on the Warpland
Beverly Dahlen, selection from A Reading
Ron Silliman, Albany
Charles Alexander and Cynthia Miller, Aviary Corridor (this is an
offset-printed "screenfold" co-published with Light & Dust Books)
Thomas A. Clarke, I Love Those Clean, Bright Rooms


Also, a reminder that Karen Mac Cormack's _The Tongue Moves Talk_ has just
been issued and is available. It is a new full-length book of poems
available for $11. More information about it can be found at the Chax web
site,

I agree with this. Maybe we need a term of art: the etymological lie.
Years ago in a workshop the professor complimented a couple of lines as
being "a fine lie." Though I was happy about the compliment, I had to
fess up and admit that the lines were lifted directly from the OED. So
what I had, I guess, was a truth so good it "had to be a lie"!

Yep, but I think Dutton is if anything  younger than Jameson. Each

Oh hell. I should have been clear about this in the first place. These are
the circumstances as they occurred to me. Let me lay them out and see what
you-all think.

I work for Associated Writing Programs (at least for the moment; my DEROS
is August 1st). Every year, we have the Award Series, a $2000 prize for
book-length mss. Last year, Ms. Graham was our poetry judge.

During her judging process, she called and said she was dissatisfied with
the screeners' choices, and named a few titles of mss. she would like to
see, assuming they had been entered. Nobody thought much of this at the
time; we assumed they were mss. she had seen while judging the Whitman or
the National Poetry Series. We sent them to her.

As it turned out, the winner she picked was Michelle Glazer, with whom she
had worked recently and closely at Iowa. The finalists she named turned
out to have been Iowa students as well.

Now, I'm all for advocacy for students, being a grad student myself. But
the rep of this contest rests on its being blind-judged. What really
amazes me is that, like other staff members, I got a call from a woman who
would not give her name but pointed out that the Whitman and NPS winners
had been Ms. Graham's students as well, and that we were more likely than
not to have this be true of the Award Series. I vigorously defended her,
and said I felt this was unlikely to happen.

That is the sequence of events. It makes me uneasy. I am willing to accept
that I may be mistaken on this one. What do the rest of you think?

i agree that there's an ethical tho nuanced distinction between advocacy

As a gossip-hound, I loved Gwyn McVay's story about the Associated
Writing Programs Award Series.  The more I think about it, though, the
less "unethical" what Graham did seems to me.  The competition was
pre-judged, like almost all such competitions.  How?  By the selection
of the judge, in this case, Jorie Graham.  The competition was thus
designed to give money to a Jorie Graham clone, with the details as to
just which of her clones it should go to being left up to her.  There
not being any competitions I know of that'd choose a judge interested in
the kind of poetry I most admire, it's all one to me.

And Chris, what's notable about that course description is how much it
sounds like anybody's course description. It reminds of those schools of
broadcasting that turn out people who have learnt this one use of a voice.
Sure, beyond the course description lie acres of unblazed vocal chords; it
w o n ' t  be a course in learning how to produce course-descriptions.  It
may serve some students well. Had I composed it, though, I'd worry that the
students I brought in with it, would be a bit tin-eared. Huh? We've all
written job letters, mind you, etc etc, let's not be holier than him. It's
no moral point, not to me. It just feels like, well, "Hello out there!
You--you voices!  I f  you have one! Anything worthy of the name! Bring it
on in & just  m a y b e  I'll do something about it. . . Like float it into
Santa Monica Bay & install some rusted Tristrams in its stead, or a few
choice [complete this sentence & send it in with your $98]" might be more
attractive all round. More revealing. More concealing. Face it, though,
there might not have been a choice. There  a r e  guidelines, Mr Clifton.
If you don't care to fit the format, we have further candidates dying to
offer this course. In the old days, we (me an some ov the boys dahn at the
Works) didn't care for this cant of "Your Voice," but for me it wasnt
anything against sounding like yourself, it had to do with  n o t doing so,
with sending a jelly-mould in one's place. With recognizing that oneself
was a jelly-mould. "Finding _a_ voice" would be what I'd study. The
contradictions are deliberate, after all.

Uh, hi all, if anybody has sent me a message in the last three weeks,
please send it again, because my software, hardware & self have been thru

Thanks for setting forth this little history in much clearer detail --

such a scenario does seem surprising unsettling, and potentially
scandalous.  In fact, it would be a matter for surprise if Jorie were not to
hear a good deal about these questions, anon.  (And one can't help but
wonder whether, in the end, such a compromised-seeming situation could
very well redound to the credit of those selected, for that matter.)  Off
hand -- given merely the info & version of things you've shared -- there
seems an odd suggestion of hubris (rather classically construed).

A side note: besides the issue of those Iowa students, I must confess
some startlement (not having kept track) that Ms. Graham was called in
to serve as judge in no less than three distinct competitions of this type,
one after another.

We human beings (& poets) are famed for our flaws, no doubt.  While I'm
sure I'll continue to admire Jorie's astonishing poetry, yet a less salutory
manner of astonishment does creep into the picture here.  Naturally, the
poet must have her own perception and conception of what was going
on.  I hope she sees her way clear to share that with us, in the course of
things.

(I'll even admit to being mildly hopeful of one further surprise-twist: a
*somehow* more-satisfying explanation for the events you've related?)

I wanted to understand Jameson's sentence.  So I got several more
attacks on Dutton, a couple on Associated Press, and some very
familiar Wittgenstein.  All this is fine by me, especially since
I knew it all already.  We're all Young Turks here--who, to answer
an etymological fallacy, were the mid-nineteenth-century reformers
in the Ottoman Empire.

My thanks to Tom Orange, for a decent response and a poem I ain't
dumb enough to ask him to explain.

Check out "fallacy" in the OED, meanings 3 and 4, or the American Heritage,
meanings 1 and 2. "Fallacy" doesn't mean "wrong."

The issue was the denotation of a particular word. It is possible to argue
that "epic" was understood by Greeks in say, 400 BC, differently than it had
been understood 400 years earlier without changing the meaning of the word
so that it no longer denotes anything reliably--so that it no longer
communicates efficiently.

But I'm a conservative old fart in these matters. "Problematize," for
instance, strikes me as a barbaric usage.

Let me speak here as one of the NEA grantees whose award provoked the
Masters article. I think Herb Levy's post got it exactly right. Whenever you
take anything like "professional contributions to the field" or whatever
into consideration, you're going to get all of the aesthetic leanings that
lend themselves to people making such charges (and I'm sure we've all heard
the same with regards to every other grant making body, from NYSCA to the
California Arts Council to the Guggies to the Gerbode). The field of poetry
is not, as a profession, all that large. Problems develop when the same
aesthetic orientation is represented over and over and over again (viz the
Guggies, the Pulitzer and for the most part the conservative leaning years
at the NEA).

I took the Georgia Review piece to be a classic example of a member of a
privileged clique yowling that their clique had one year in which it did not
dominate the whole terrain, a phenomenon remarkably like the "white
backlash" over the few spaces in law and medical schools that people of
color have taken up. In fact, the rotation of aesthetic positions should be
a regular occurrance at all of the grants-making organizations.

I used my NEA grant to write two books (Lit and Paradise) and work on
several others, to edit the anthology In the American Tree and be able to
take the time off from a real job to teach for a year at SF State and UC San
Diego (which I could never have afforded to have done otherwise). I also
brought my teeth (sadly neglected in the 60s and 70s) back to something
approaching the state of the art. I managed to make that ten grand last five
full years. I know plenty of other poets (of all aesthetic stripes) who've
similarly marshalled what little they've received in funds from whichever
organization just as frugally.

There may be a poet somewhere who bought a sportscar, but wasting the grant
money would be his or her loss, not ours. It reminds me of Mark Strand's
comment about the Poet Laureate-ship of the US, that it "hadn't done much"
for him. Contrast that with the way Bob Hass used the position to do
something for poetry. (I'll vote with Hass on this one every time.)

But the fellowship money is not where the real value in the NEA has been--it
just hasn't reached enough people. I've heard supporters and officials of
the NEA argue that the majority of funds spent on poetry in the US comes
from the NEA, but that certainly hasn't been true in my life. Of the roughly
$100K I've made from poetry (spread out over 30 years), maybe one third
could have been traced back, directly or indirectly, to the NEA.

The real value of the Endowment has been in the book grants, which have done
a substantial amount to underwrite thousands of good small press books.
Every time Sun&Moon or Segue or Chax or Grey Wolf or whomever gets a grant,
I get the benefit and so do you. If Steve Dickison or somebody from SPD is
on the list, I'd be curious to get a sense of what percent of the books that
store carries were underwritten at least in part by the endowment (whatever
the number, I'm sure that it's gone down significantly in the past 5 years).

And, for whatever reason, the book grants have been notably more even handed
than the fellowships for years.

All best,

Thanks for setting forth this little history in much clearer detail --

such a scenario does seem surprising unsettling, and potentially
scandalous.  In fact, it would be a matter for surprise if Jorie were not
to
hear a good deal about these questions, anon.  (And one can't help but
wonder whether, in the end, such a compromised-seeming situation could
very well redound to the credit of those selected, for that matter.)  Off
hand -- given merely the info & version of things you've shared -- there
seems an odd suggestion of hubris (rather classically construed).

A side note: besides the issue of those Iowa students, I must confess
some startlement (not having kept track) that Ms. Graham was called in
to serve as judge in no less than three distinct competitions of this type,
one after another.

We human beings (& poets) are famed for our flaws, no doubt.  While I'm
sure I'll continue to admire Jorie's astonishing poetry, yet a less
salutory
manner of astonishment does creep into the picture here.  Naturally, the
poet must have her own perception and conception of what was going
on.  I hope she sees her way clear to share that with us, in the course of
things.

(I'll even admit to being mildly hopeful of one further surprise-twist: a
*somehow* more-satisfying explanation for the events you've related?)

If, as Ron Silliman points out, the problem is getting more grant money to
poets & presses, then I have to disagree with Bob Grumman that ethics don't
come into play in Gwyn's story & it doesn't matter anyway.  Seems to me
the AWP award was designed so that the judge would choose from finalists
selected by AWP rather than personal favorites or students of hers,
and AWP should have said no to her.  That seems pretty obvious.

I agree with Mark Prejnar that the aim shd be anonymity & fairness in
judging if we want more government or other money to go to these things.
Sounds like AWP did a disservice to all those people (not me, thanks)
who dutifully sent in their xeroxed ms & application money.

On the balance between cronyism ethics & advocacy: seems an ironic downside
of balkanization & "schools" formation in poetry - the schools help build
movements but make it hard for them to get funded.  The idea that there
are different aesthetics (ours are good, of course, theirs are bad) & that
this justifies cut-throat advocacy to the point of closing down competitions -
this is sad.  Advocacy shd not be an excuse for cronyism.  This is a complex
issue - maybe editors & grant awarders need to get their heads together from
all ends of the spectrum to design certain standards & means of working
together.  Judges should be required to have certain expertise & openness
across the whole field.  Poets could be asked to provide a couple paragraphs
with their ms. outlining their own development & influences(?).  Judges
could ask for 2nd opinion on screened finalists they don't "get".  All
competitions anonymous.  Judges shd sign an agreement statement on
certain standards and approaches to judgeship.  Etc... - Henry G.

Several years ago I was a screening judge for the AWP Poetry
Competition, and the organization went to great lengths to keep the
judging blind, replacing names with numbers, etc. And when I recognized
a manuscript from a student I had taught in a summer workshop, I sent it
to another screener. Now I have so far taken a rather indulgent view of
the networking that goes on in various corners of the poetry world,
thinking that advocating for the kind of thing you believe in is more
important than some abstract sort of "fairness." But the Graham case is
a little different--she seems to have gone outside the established
conditions of the competition, and I think the people who plunked down
their twenty bucks have at least the right, if not to be treated
"fairly," then to have the stated rules followed. The judge, as I
recall, has the right to name his/her own screeners, so if even a
hand-picked jury didn't put through the mss Graham was looking for,
maybe those books weren't any good.

Had the final judge gone outside the screeners' recommendations the year
I worked for the competition I'd have screamed bloody murder. (The
screeners work a lot harder than the final judge.)

If a press just wants to have Jorie Graham's name associated with their
editorial selections, they can hire her as a consultant, but then of
course they wouldn't get the entry fees a contest generates. Perhaps, as
in some competitions, the name of the judge should be revealed only
after the selections are made.

For the record: I am an Iowa grad (pre-Graham), have published Graham's
poems in one of the journals for which I serve as an editor, and am
currently the volunteer General Editor for the AWP's Intro Journals
Project, a competition for students in AWP writing programs, which is
judged blind, and for which the judges read every single submission in
their genre.

     I've never served on the individual fellowships panel at the NEA but
in 1994 I was a panelist for the small press grants, and in 1995, chaired
that panel, and I very much agree with Ron regarding the benefits and
relative fairness of the book grants.  The fairness may result from the
panel's composition, which differs from the fellowship panel, in that
publishers, editors, booksellers and usually an outside business person,
as well as writers, participate.  The presses are scored on book design,
distribution efforts, sales, financial management, marketing, etc., as
well as "quality" of literature and the "diversity" of the lists.  In my
experience with the panel, presses were favorably regarded if they managed
money well, made efforts to sell books (by linking up with SPD,
printing catalogues, placing ads, whatever), design well, and if they
published a "diverse" list, by which they meant race/gender/ethnicity.
Each of these factors was independently scored.  (Panelists spent months
reading application materials which included detailed financial statements
and plans, as well as publications in advance).   At the end of the day,
we were given our tallies: a list of the presses in the order in which
they had been scored by us.  We were then told where the "cut off"
was--the line above which presses would be funded.  On our list of, say,
273 presses, we would learn that only the first 84 would get money.  We
could then review the presses close to the line on either side.  Both
years, we asked for (and got) additional funding for two or three presses.
Both years, we felt that twice or three times as many presses should have
been helped, were deserving of support, as received the aid.  The sad news
is that there is no longer a small press panel.  I believe there are
categories in which the presses may still apply for NEA support, but the
literature program has been eliminated, along with all other
"discipline-based" programs.  Only the individual fellowship grants remain
in place (for the reason I posted earlier).   Having said all this,
however, I was very disconcerted to encounter such strong resistance to
innovative/experimental writing, and the arguments deployed against it
were quite spurious.  "Appeals only to a small coterie," etc.  This, it
seemed to me, could be said of all serious writing.  I found it
useful, in these instances, to play the "diversity" card in a
different manner.

Just so we don't get the idea that we're the only ones who have to
wrestle with issues of rewards and bias, here's a short piece from the
Chronicle of Higher Education, distributed to the Clarkson Liberal Arts
faculty by our dean, bless his heart.

MAGAZINES & JOURNALS

A glance at today's issue of "Nature":
Swedish study finds sexism in peer review

Why do few women hold high academic positions in biomedicine?
Among the many theories is the view that women are less
productive than men. But Christine Wenneras and Agnes Wold, two
researchers at Sweden's Goteborg University, found that the
peer-review system was to blame. The researchers examined the
peer-review system of the Swedish Medical Research Council and
compared the productivity of male and female scientists with the
scores they had received in applications for postdoctoral
fellowships. The reviewers, they found, had consistently given
female applicants lower scores than equally productive men. In
some cases, they found that female applicants would have had to
publish three extra papers in "Nature" or "Science," or 20 extra
papers in less-prestigious journals, to be ranked the same as
male applicants. "If gender discrimination of the magnitude we
have observed is operative in the peer-review systems of other
research councils and grant-awarding organizations, and in
countries other than Sweden," they write, that could account for
the discrepancy. (The journal may be found at your library or

Interesting piece about bias. Having worked as a managing editor for a
scientific journal (J. Neurosci.), I believe it.   But I have to comment:

"Nature"?

I've yet to see "Nature" at a newsstand.  Perhaps it's hidden somewhere
behind "Hustler".

And now back to our regular programming.

Hello everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  I hope all of you in the San Francisco
Bay Area this weekend, especially you visitors, come to see me in my
greatest role in Raymond Pettibon's play "Horror Tape Script" which we are
putting on at New Langton Arts on Friday and Sunday.  That's at 1246 Folsom
between 8th and 9th (San Francisco).

Those of you who have seen Pettibon's work, say at the Whitney Biennial,
will be glad to know that besides having written the play, he has designed
this production too.  I am playing "Grif," the fullback for the John Dewey
High School Bobcats, and Wayne Smith and Edmund Berrigan are my team mates.
We bring our cheerleader girl friends (Mark Ewert, Cliff Hengst and Karla
Milosevich) to a deserted mountain lake in the woods and then the play
turns into a kind of Friday the 13th/Berlin Alexanderplatz kind of festival
of violence and sensation.  Don't miss it if you possibly can, we've been
rehearsing like crazy and it should be terrific.  We're doing this play in
support of the new exhibition at Langton by D-L Alvarez and Ruby Neri which
opens tonight.  On Saturday if you are still in town Carla Harryman and Lyn
Hejinian will be reading, same space, same location, amid Pettibon's
marvelous sets.

So, come on down.  Thanks everyone.  Hope to see you, I'll be there in my
supporter and thigh pads, dress accordingly.

Speaking for Chax, without NEA money there likely wouldn't be a Chax. When
I first began making books, by hand, in the very early 1980's, some of
these books, by stroke of luck, came under the eye of David Wilk (he & I
had been visiting at the same time in Toronto and I had left books at Coach
House Press, where he saw them). David was then NEA Lit Program Director.
He got in touch and suggested we apply for a grant. We did, and that was
the first thing that made me start making books whose aims went slightly
beyond "books I just wanted to make." Later, when we moved to produce trade
editions, rather than just hand printed editions, we had NEA grants for two
out of the first three years we were doing such books. This helped books by
bp Nichol, Ron Silliman, Bev Dahlen, Sheila Murphy, and several others.
Without such funds, I don't know if we'd have ever continued to do more
than the first book or two of trade paperback editions. And in the present
climate, I often wonder if we can continue to produce such books. I don't
really expect that Chax will ever be able to get another NEA grant. This
means that we have to find a way to raise $12,000 or more a year from
donations, as in our case there are no local foundations or corporate
sponsors who are likely to champion a literary press, much less one seen as
experimental in some way and without a proven and sizable 'local' audience.

NEA has particularly been important for presses producing just a few books
a year, as, in my experience, local and state arts councils see such
presses as only supporting a few artists/writers in a year, and rather find
that a kind of elitist activity which doesn't merit the use of public funds.

>
>And, for whatever reason, the book grants have been notably more even handed
>than the fellowships for years.
I don't know why this is. But I think NEA lit staff has always wanted to be
as even handed as possible, and they've gone out of their way to get a
breadth of people on press panels.

Well, the Young Turks were the would-be reformers of the Ottoman Empire. They
were also the ones that betrayed the trust of the dominant Armenian political
party in Turkey in 1908, the Dashnakhzagans, and became fully responsible for
the systematic genocide of the Armenian people in Turkey and the Near East from
1908 until around 1922 when their leader, Enver Pasha, was killed by the
Russians in mopdern day Armenia.

ok, i'll delurk on this one!... in addition to all the really fine points
being made:

-- in academic terms, there are distinctions to be drawn twixt the
'scholarly' and the 'creative'---relatively speaking, few 'creative'
publications with which i've been associated conduct "blind review"...
whereas scholars pride themselves on same... now (you folks know me well
enough to know that) i don't believe that "blind review" is generally, or
in its entirety, blind, and i certainly don't wish to privilege the
scholarly over the creative... as some of you have pointed out, there is a
selection process that generally takes place *first*... an editor for a
well-known academic press once confided in me that if he didn't want a
manuscript published, he *could* simply send it to an editor whom he knew
would reject it... those of us who've been involved in "blind reviews" know
that we were asked to review such & such... which is not exactly to argue
against same, but to reinforce the point made by joseph deumer re the way
this process works, can work... gwyn's account (thanx gwyn) of the awp
jorie graham situation is, in my view, and given the stated contest
criteria, deplorable...

--- BUT as maria d. indicated, wrt tenure, this idea of "anonymity" is
entirely problematic in itself... as though "fairness" (what? who?) were at
stake... moving the discussion of evaluation to tenure, btw, is a
gear-shift, yes---please bear with me... there are depts. that conduct only
INTERNAL tenure review (they don't use external reviewers), there are some
that use only external reviews, some that use both, some that require (as
maria indicated) "anonymous" external reviews... this is all very
contentious, the entire tenure system is all very contentious... and
incredibly ambiguous---did any of you read in _the chronicle_ about m.
norton wise having been rejected for tenure at princeton?... m. norton
wise?---C'MON!... if he's vulnerable to such capriciousness (and hidden
agenda), *everybody* is... but isn't the point here, in any case (and to
switch back to publication, which is btw so keyed to tenure in academe)
that anonymity can get you published and unpublished, and that recognition
too can get you published and unpublished?... reputations can work against
you... and anonymity, again, is compromised by *any form* of
advocacy---what so many judges view as the imprimatur of their "taste"
(which, simply by virtue of being chosen as judges, judges often feel has
been somehow legitimated)... that said, i've judged material mself, and i
try to be open as i can to that which is not entirely to my liking... and
to say it as simply as i can, it's NOT EZ...

--- still, a further complication:  i need here to beat the drum some of
the media question... the most problematic review situations of which i'm
aware have to do with how to evaluate work in (what is perceived as) a new
medium... how CAN you evaluate a hypertext if in fact there are no
generally agreed-upon "standards," however fraught, for what a hypertext is
supposed to "do"?... that is to say, when the question of "standards"
itself, which in so many cases is a canard when it comes to art, cannot be
erected as a putatively neutral arbiter of value... and doesn't the media
question highlight the general inadequacy of (1) simple "blind review" AND
(2) mere advocacy?... as to (1), you have to choose somebody as a reviewer,
as in all such reviews but here even more critical perhaps, who can be
"open-minded" enough to somehow (how?) evaluate that which is emerging as
such... and as to (2), you want somebody to be selective, *even as* they
advocate said emerging item... you don't want, that is, simply to import
w/o critical intervention criteria from print textuality into electronic
textuality... this is one reason why it may be necessary to maintain the
UNblind review status of so many electronic venues---to keep them fresh, as
it were, and to finally, finally permit less orthodox work to get some
air-play...

--- all of which is to say one thing further:  as a writer, i just wasn't
weaned on the contest track... i know many writers, some of them mighty
fine writers, whose entire self-image rests on putting together manuscripts
and submitting them to contests and award series and the like... i think we
was raised on different planets... while i understand the value and
security of such writing networks, i have never quite trusted them to value
what i value... perhaps primarily b/c i sense the sheer power distributed
throughout such regions... at the same time, i know damn well that i could
*never* have seen an academic book in print w/o the sheer advocacy of
like-minded souls... so in all, i'd have to say that this entire question
of evaluation is made messy by the all-too-human structures we've created
that (can) aspire to awarding meritorious work... whatever the ethix
implied here, seems to me we need to be willing to *say* as accurately as
possible what's going on... and to take some responsibility---if we're
judging or evaluating---for making our decisions understood to our various
publics...

btw, imho, the contest model has become the model *against which* the slam
scene rails... slams did not invent the agonistic spectacle of poetry on
the hoof... in effect, both the slam event and the more specifically
mfa-directed (sorry you mfa-ers!---not your fault) contest acquisitions
approach to publication share a certain similarity in this regard...
yes---here the craft/voice thread is most pertinent, the capacity for
"identification" linked tacitly and not so tacitly with "value"... and as
to publishing one's friends:  friends often publish friends, and there's
nothing wrong with this, as long as it's out in the open... it *may* lead
to a product saturated with a specific aesthetic (however 'successful' or
'unsuccessful'), but here the question of friendship is a problem only if
one is concerned with sales, or with what non-friendly audiences may
think... if (as eliza indicates) your role on an editorial board is broadly
conceived as serving a public constituency that is competing (in effect)
for publication space, there may be good reason not to publish your own
work in such a place... on the other hand, i have been *asked* (by my
seniors) as an editorial board member to publish work in the respective
journal simply b/c they wanted something "different"... now i'm not really
comfortable with this (my call!) so next time i'm asked i'll be *selecting*
somebody else(s)... one may, of course, consider all publications as simply
prize-winning fora... but this latter, i think, constitutes a reduction i'm
just not willing to make...

finally (!)---what *about* this discussion, here, in these spaces?...
speaking of gossip (see epic/redux thread) this is a fine medium for
pulling out and displaying the hidden variables, provided we're coming at
same with care and goodwill... i'd like to see it stay that way...

Ken,

I'll make a few general points that may be of interest to the list as a
whole, and then maybe we can continue the discussion of details off-list
[I'd like to; the issues are important for me]. I do not want to step into
the breach [a formula, btw] between the different orality camps.  There are
issues, like the crude distinction between improvisation and memorization,
which Parry-Lord admittedly have not handled well.  And other issues, like
a precise definition of "formula" and the degree to which the formula may
be a mark of orality, innovation vs. tradition, etc., are too complicated
to be worked through in a brief post. It might be interesting explore these
off-list.

Putting aside Parry-Lord, Ong, Finnegan, Goody, and other oralists who
doubt that Vedic is unambiguously oral are *badly* misinformed. There is no
evidence whatsover of any writing on the Indian subcontinent before 4th
cent. BCE [putting aside the Indus Valley script, which has not been
deciphered, and with which the Vedic clans had no contact] - and there is
no reference to writing in early Vedic. The hymns of the Rgveda were
composed orally and transmitted orally [and still are transmitted orally]
-- this is a point that Ong et al. badly confuse. The astonishing mnemonic
techniques that were used to memorize Vedic texts [literally backwards and
forwards -- without writing!] might be worth talking about at some point.
But this is a technique of *transmission*, not of composition.  It is
obvious to all Vedicists that there are good measures of both memorization
and improvisation in the *composition* of Vedic texts [so that one could
use Vedic to dispute with Lord's insistence that oral texts are not
memorized compositions]. It is true, though, that Vedicists have not kept
up with oral theory [except for moi, and maybe one or two others].

A far more important point is this [and I'll try to be brief]:for me the
most significant thing that the P-L thesis has done is to contribute to a
new way of seeing composition in general [not just oral! and not just
poetic!]. The basic unit of composition is *not* the individual [aha!]
word, but rather the formula.  The metaphor "flow of speech" [which is very
old and very good] suggests that the segmentation of "speech" [cf. Grk.
"epos", Skt. "vacas"; also the related Latin "vox"] is arbitrary [think of
Heraclitus]. Certain linguists and grammarians and others might for
personal reasons choose the isolable word as their primary unit of analysis
[i.e., segmentation]. But others [like certain native grammarians of India]
preferred to work with larger units [like "complete thought" - "sphota"]. I
wld suggest that this is how Vedic poets operated too: with larger units.
Not that they couldn't segment out the individual word when they wanted or
needed to, but rather that the *basic* unit that they worked with was
larger than the individual word.

In Vedic poetics, the basic unit of analysis is the formula, which I wld
define loosely [I agree that the P-L model has been mechanistic and
static]: a word string that is perceived as a meaningful unit and that can
be manipulated as such [sometimes coinciding with metrical units, sometimes
not].

I think this sort of analysis [at a higher level than the word] might work
with other poetries.  What do you think?

Besides P-L and the Sanskrit grammarians [the planet's first true
linguists] other sources for this poetics are Jakobson, Benveniste [and in
general theorists of a semiotics of discourse].

Of course, now I've gone over the edge and have abandoned the
orality-literacy distinction completely...

Hope this makes sense.
George

i've been following this thread with interest. however, what strikes me
about the testimonials and the kvetching both is the more-would-be-better
reductionism. two points: peer assessment for that without peer is
at the very least suspect, and the design brief of most bureaucracies is
to function with as few mistakes as possible. i admit to being
disappointed by the normative aspect of most rewards for merit, but i
positively lust after those dysfunctions of the state of play that grant
insight into what passes for an economy of ideas. prejudice against
mistakes (yes, it's public money, but it's all public money!) will always
and only give us more of what we know and what we know is obviously..

Joe, do you mind if I summarize what I see as a couple of your points?
You decry what happened in the Graham case as Gwyn described.  But you
don't see the point of these contests anyway & slams (another kind of
contest) have showed one alternative.  Electronic publication raises a
whole new set of issues.  & the whole thing is murky & complex & friends
will help each other & what they believe in and "anonymity" is an abstract
ideal.

ok?  Too reductive, probably.  Here's what I say.  Yes, contests inevitably
involve power, prestige, publication, past history.  But the potential is there
for contests to be an extension of the basic author/reader relationship,
and the basic author/editor relationship.  In other words: when I write
something, I want it to stand on its own 2 feet & maybe interest an INDEPENDENT
reader.  (I'm using "I" here in sort of an impersonal exemplary mode.)
(Still an individual, though!)  I expect editors to try to act also as
themselves - as independent readers (with all the tendencies which I will
try to inform myself about regarding their publication).  And I expect
contests to act in exactly the same fashion.  I would like them to judge
my work anonymously & play by the rules as far as they are able.  Just
read it.  You'll see it's better than anybody else's stuff & I should
have had my own monikered leatherbound easy chair at the Academy of
Fussbudget Letters long ago.

I don't see this as a totally unattainable ideal. Nor do I see it as the
be all & end all, OF COURSE!!! Where would we be without editors &
publishers who pursue their own leads & taste & are very finicky?
I hear a lot of waffling on this thread. Get in line, gang, & give me
the money.  - Henry G.

henry, my post was trying to tiptoe on the line twixt what i mself find
desirable (for me!) and what i think i can add to what others may find
desirable... of course this is itself an act of judgment...

i am tiptoeing simply b/c i don't share some folks' enthusiasm for awards
and contests and so forth, but would certainly not turn one down if
offered!... nor would i turn down some bucks!... make sense?... i hope
so... in any case, i trust we can balance and maintain irreconcilable
epistemologies (if this is what they be)... and i don't think, though i'm
not quite sure you meant this, that this balancing act is "waffling," if by
"waffling" you meant to imply a lack of moral certainty or some such...

it's just not, never has been, in my experience, a matter of
"neutralities"... yes, there is anonymous review, to varying degrees---but
this then becomes a matter of somebody or other's taste... and i can't
imagine that taste isn't time- and place-bound (we really don't need
bourdieu to understand this, but if you like bourdieu, why then---)...

so of course i assume there are times when we'll all, to varying degrees,
be writing for our friends... and times when we may find ourselves writing
for some collective fiction... who knows?---mebbe our 'friends' are
fictions too?!... but the point here is that there is no one or two ways to
understand this contest/awards thing, as either "blind" or simple
advocacy... whatever way you come to it, of course, i would think it wise
to include that political-institutional dimension (which is, ironically
enough, the dimension that tends to get excluded)...

personally, i don't aspire to fame in such terms... i did, at the advice of
my friends and publisher (and in part for my publisher's sake) try to enter
my first book into all sortsa contests... came up with beans, but it didn't
mean much to me b/c it was all ex post facto... what i once imagined were
contest/award possibilities (some time back) evaporated for me as quickly
as i  became disillusioned with the realities of same---i.e., once i found
mself more on the judging side of things... while i feel i can do some good
as a judge (and others can too), as a writer i find i just can't direct
mself toward same... some can (some who are my friends, again)...

so it's very much a matter of how you construct yourself as a writer... for
me, there are times i want to make some money... i haven't been real good
at this, btw, but i'm trying!... at the same time, if i write simply FOR
money, i am, in my view, in real trouble...

best,

Henry,
Thanks for your thoughtful questions. "Decry" may be too strong a term,
but it does seem fishy on ethical grounds. The point of contests? I
think I see the point & I've entered a few myself. My first book was
published by Georgia out of a batch of first books they solicit each
year, and my secodn during a "contest" sponsored by Owl Creek, but
neither of these paid a chas prize, and both were done in-house. So are
these contests? One had an outside reader, the other didn't. What I'm
driving at is that there is a whole range of competitions, some more
like contests than others. OK, but that's background. Slams do provide
an alternative, and I have never said they shouldn't prosper, only that
with my aesthetic I'm not comfortable participating in them. So, I don't
really have a problem with competition in the arts in general or poetry
in particular. But once you admit competition, you want the conditions
of any particular instance to be consistent, I think. Which doesn't mean
their couldn't be a range of competitions from the blind peer-review
model of the sciences all the way over to a judge just plain old
soliciting the book they want to win from one of their students (Doesn't
this happen in the National?)--as long as everybody knows from the start
how the thing will run. Does that clarify my position? And I'm so new to
cyber-anything I can't speak to the ethics of electronic publication,
though it seems like it might produce in time a functional alternative.

Probably it would be better if the world were a better place and
everybody agreed that we would read poems as poems & forget the author's
name and/or reputation even when we know it. Having been raised by
fundamentalists, however, I am very suspicious of better worlds, so I'm
skeptical about your "I don't see this as an unattainable ideal." Not to
be overly cynical, but in my book, all ideals are unattainable.

It really comes down, doesn't it, to the line between a judge advocating
a KIND of work, and advocating the work of a particular student? I do a
fair amount of editing, and I know other editors, and I know a couple of
folks who have served on NEA review panels, and we all, I think, to the
best of our ability, try to read the work that walks through the door on
its own two feet. Now I know there are editors and judges who don't do
this, but they have to live with themselves.

Well, I seem, as is my wont, to have rambled off the topic. If I haven't
made myself clear, or responded to your specific issues, try me again.

best,
JD

I couldn't agree more.  Although I would love to get an NEA grant for
myself, I'm quite proud of the NEA grant money I helped raise for Tia
Chucha.  Individuals tend to be a lot more resiliant to arts funding
cutbacks than institutions, with publishing, by being so capital intensive,
the most vulnerable literary institution around.  Without that money, there
would be a lot fewer books around, to the loss of us all.

joe a mentioned electronic publishing as an alternative to print, and it's
pretty clear to all that this is the wave of the future. however, my dept,
which only recognizes number of pages published when it passes out "merit
pay" (there's no cost of living increase) changes the rules when it comes
to electronic publishing. rather than count ms pages and then figure what
it wd be in print, as they do with print articles, they cut that number in
half, on the assumption that standards are less rigorous for electronic
journals. I recently published a 30pp ms article in Postmodern Culture, and
tho' i proved to them that the journal was refereed and owned by Johns
Hopkins, they assigned the absolute minimum, the same as i'd have gotten
for a couple of 500 word reviews.

In response to the Jorie Graham issue, this was not the first time I've
heard this complaint about her.  I would never ask her to judge any
contest, and I will not send a manuscript to a contest in which she is a
judge (why waste my money when there are all those good books/CDs/beer I
can buy?).  There are plenty of writers with reputations equal to or
exceeding Graham's who are fair and play by the rules.  If you're running a
contest, ask around and pick them to be your judge.

        "Judge not, lest ye be judged . . ."

        Bob Grumman had an excellent point--appointing a judge can
pre-determine a case--an award--

        There is no taxonomy without taxation just as to be defined is to
be fined.
        (Antithetically, Picasso claimed:  "I don't seek, I find . . . ")

        Tammany Hall is ever with us.  There's been quite an increasing
storm of attacks on judges in the last few years--Federal judges--by
various interest groups, each of whom feels that the person on the bench
has not their interests in mind--whether it be the death penalty,abortion
rights--or that the judge is a drunk or an atheist or in some other way
incapable of seeing things "the right way".

        As Claude Rains said in Casablanca:  "What!!! There's gambling
going on here!  I'm shocked! Round up the usual suspects!"

        In a wonderful essay called "MNMLST POETRY:  Unacclaimed but
Flourishing" up at Light and Dust
(http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm ) Bob Grumman notes that his
all time favorite minimalist poem is Aram Saroyan's

                        lighght

this poem, to be sure--caused a brouhaha with the the NEA nearly thirty
years ago . . .

        "Plus ca change . . ."
        In the early 1940's Henry Miller and the painter Abe Rattner
applied for Guggenheim Fellowships.  They wanted to travel the USA, from
which they'd been in voluntary exile for a decade and write and paint about
the
place.Miller at the age of fifty learned to drive to undertake the trip.
Rattner had to cancel out and Miller continued on alone.
        The pair never received a Grant, but Miller wrote a book about
the trip.
        It's called The Air-Conditioned Nightmare.

        The book concludes with an Addenda listing all those who received
awards and giving the address to apply for them.

        It's easy to say "Let there be light"--

                just don't expect much "lighght"

or as the Brazilian proverb has it:

        "When shit is worth money, the poor will be born without assholes"

they are just plain interesting and GOOD.  a pushcart volume from any
year is always a good read...; 2) they have an incredibly diverse database
as base.  for those who don't know, pushcart small press prize series
publishes one collection a year of "best" short stories published that
year.  they have the most voracious readers in their screening panel
that i've ever seen.  mags with readerships of 200 from teeny weeny
towns in the corners of midwest states to punk 'zines to Old Line
Literary Journals to house organs for mfa programs...;  3) they seem
to have no particular "camp" or set of cronies.  authors included
range from pulitzer prize winners to first timers -- for example, i
remember a Tim O'Brien story, one of my favorite and so memorable that
nine years after reading it, it still drifts into my mind about once a
week in one way or another.  i also remember a story from a woman who'd
never published before.  ANYWHERE.  it was in a small state run literary
journal or something, and got chosen from out of that.

i don't know how they do what they do, but i'd love to see that kind of
range and diversity in prizes/contests/magazines/etc.

Responding to Joe & Joseph,
Joe, the "waffle" bit was my kinda humor - not aimed at you.  I meant
people shd stop waffling & send me the dough.
   God, what if there were ONLY contests!  Sometimes it seems like that
in poetwy pubwishing.  & what a hellhole that is.  Think if the painters
had to submit everything to judges.  Well, they do, actually... but there's
also a life to be lived there.  & in poetry too.

"Some painters, including myself, do not care what chair they are sitting on.
It does not even have to be a comfortable one.  They are too nervous to find
out where they ought to sit.  They do not want to "sit in style".  Rather, they
have found that painting - to be painting at all, in fact - is a way of living
today, a style of living, so to speak.  That is where the form of it lies.
It is exactly in its uselessness [& the public's indifference - HG] that it
is free.  Those artists do not want to conform. They only want to be inspired."
- Willem de Kooning

But all I say is, if there are contests, hey, let them live up to the standards
at least of the contest I won in 3rd grade, from the "Alex & His Dog" show
(a local tv show).  I sent in a picture or something, & got to be on the
show & got a pair of two-gun holsters (I mean a 2-gun holster).  Still use
it today in moments of stress.  Now I know that contest had no inside track,
no name recognition, no ulterior motive, totally anonymous, based purely
on quality according to the judge's most impersonal objective judgement.
At'sa way it oughta be. The attainable ideal - on local MN television,
no less! - Henry Gould  (but then, they do it better in Minnesota...)

it occurs to me, while i'm busy shooting my mouth off in these parts, that
i might introduce an example of judging that seems to compromise me no
matter what i do...

on my campus, for five years now, i've judged, along with my colleagues, a
departmental writing contest... i judge, among other categories, our poetry
and fiction awards, each of which gives a top prize of $250---hardly
insignificant!... at the same time, students may submit multiple entries,
and may work with faculty (are encouraged to do so!) on their entries...

now given that i'm one of two faculty who teaches creative writing, i tend
to see my students' work showing up as submissions... technically, work is
supposed to be anonymously submitted, but nobody makes any bones about the
fact that it's not this way de facto---and how *can* it be anonymous if we
work with students?...

needless to say, i try as i can to pick what i think is the best work...
and b/c [he sez], the better writers tend to migrate into my courses (being
as how i'm on a tech campus and teaching creative writing), i end up often
picking the writing of students in my classes, "my" students (i'm not the
only judge, but still)... in any case i try, i try to pick (for 1st, 2nd,
3rd place) the best of various different writing styles...

i do what i can, that is... but what i also do each year is revisit (for
mself that is) what the function of this contest is supposed to do... as i
see it, it's supposed to provide students with some spending money (much
needed given our high tuition, and the economic class of many of our
students), it's supposed to encourage writing, and it's supposed to reward
talent (perhaps in order of increasing supposed-to's)... ysee, it's
supposed to do so many things...

so when i say that the jorie graham-awp situation is "deplorable," i am
trying to be forgiving, i am trying, based on gwyn's account, to 'account
for' what it means to choose one's students---and i have some experience in
doing so, albeit in what i think is a substantively different context (one
with a pretty clear authority hierarchy, to boot, twixt teacher and
student, that is part of the contest structure)...

anyway, advocacy is all tied up in what i do as judge---i try to advocate
the best of different aesthetics... at the same time, i try to be fair...
but i end up (generally) picking my own students' work, no doubt revealing
my prejudices in the process... one can argue that the contest itself is
flawed in concept, but then---can you really set it up so as to avoid
entirely these sorts of conflicts?... in any case, it's *not* set up that
way, we are *not* allowed to change it (the money comes from an endowment,
with stipulations), and $250 a pop is $250---sure to help somebody...

best,

Henry Gould makes a good point about "the AWP award (being) designed so
that the judge would choose from finalists selected by AWP rather than
personal favorites or students of hers," something I didn't know.  Once
again I've responded before knowing the full background.  Hard not to
with such a buzzer-stabber of a topic.  I would still contend that the
contest is, in effect, pre-judged: a group of people decide a certain
kind of poet should be given money so pick the screeners and judge or
judges they think most likely to reward that kind of poet.

Jorie Graham, if she acted as reported, went over the line, though, I
would now agree to that.

Henry's suggestions about ways to improve judging make sense, too.  I
particularly go for the idea of making it possible for a judge not
understanding some poet's work to get a second opinion.  How to get that
judge to admit to lack of understanding, though. . . .

As for books getting better treatment from the NEA than individual
writers, which is probably true, I suspect it's because: (1) there
aren't as many presses as poets (and they don't take rejection so
personally), and (2) awards to presses are awards to groups--i.e., to
the several writers a given press has published; so compromises are
easier: Judge X can be charitable to the publisher of otherstream poet
Q, whom Judge X despises, because the same publisher published
knownstream poet R, whom Judge X loves.

maria, of course your dept. doing that is absolute bullshit...

this is the sort of thing that's calculated to ruin the eletronic
environment, at least in terms of academic participation... next they'll be
saying that "only such & such online work" will count toward tenure... tell
me, what "value" do they assign to a hypertext?...

what's even more intriguing is the difference twixt u of minnesota and
where i am... here, we don't "assign" value to publications as such... we
have no written criteria as to what constitutes sufficient publication for
tenure... every time i ask this question i'm told that this "can't" be
done... when so many institutions do just that...

if you assign value, you tend to reify categories... at the same time, if
you don't, tenure candidates are left groping for direction... i would
think that general guidelines for publication should be provided, and that
these should be flexible enough to permit for innovative work [note my
dropping into adminese]...

in any case, i participated in a symposium held at uic this past weekend,
on "the teaching of cyberspace through online courses"... the symposium was
led by jim sosnoski, who teaches in the english dept. at uic... among the
many topics discussed over two days was this question of tenure & promotion
for online work (including publication, teaching, moos, etc.)... suffice to
say that this debate will continue, and that (i hope) its terms will alter
in the process...

once again i found mself advocating [wink] that we use these newer media to
help institute change... against which, some tend to see such media as
merely extensions of the print world, authority and all intact---'let's
preserve the status quo'...

anyway... an essay in _pmc_ is an essay in a critical journal, period...
the idea of devising some sort of "conversion table" strikes me as sheer
nonsense...

In Minnesota, they have a well-run contest called Happy Face Awards.
You go into a supermarket.  These people in clerk smocks are waiting
there, smiling at you.  If you smile back, you're in the running.
Out of the blue, you get this envelope in the mail, with your
very own photo of yourself, entering the store, along with a gift
certificate for anything in the smorgasbord section!  This contest
really rewards people for beautifying their environment with joyful

(they get that from the electronic eye at the check-out counter).

henry, an outside judge is a good idea... but it won't happen on my campus,
given that you'd most probably have to PAY somebody to do alla that
reading!... and that, even setting aside the matter of money, my dept.
likes to keep such activities 'in-house'... all sortsa reasons why that i
won't go into... one reason i *will* mention is that, by keeping it
in-house, we look (as a dept. of humanities on a tech. campus) as though
*we're* putting in the extra effort, making a vital contribution to the
campus that's not "service"-related, etc... not that we aren't, but---

but you know this tune, i'm sure...

i'm not blaming anybody in my dept.---it's just the way things work, have
worked, for over twenty years now... and twenty years is, well, twenty
years...

It is interesting.  I took some time to dig around.  In fact, the semantic
range of the word "epos" is wide at the beginning [Homer, Pindar], wide at
the middle [say, Plato or Aristotle], and wide at the end [the scholiasts].
That is, the word covers a rather large territory from Homer all the way
down to late antiquity.  I won't go into details.  I also looked into the
derivate "epikos". It turns out to be unattested until just abt the
Christian era.  The Latin borrowing "epicus" surfaces in the 3rd cent BCE,
usually accompanying words like "poeta", "poema, "carmen".

In short, there is no evidence whatsoever that the Grk word changed its
meaning: its mg. was *always* broader than "our" "epic". It seems to me
that it might be more likely that the semantic change is the responsibility
of Latin writers, rather than Greek ones. I'm going to consult some
classicists to see what they think.

maria, is there anybody in your dept. whose responsibilities could be
conceived, at least in part, in electronic terms---somebody who is
understood as "the" hypermedia, hyperfiction, etc., expert?...

i can think of LOTS of ways to go with this... one way would be to drop a
citation list the size of mt. everest on top of somebody or other's
head---scholarly essays and books that deal with hypermedia, the effect of
which is to legitimate ht as scholarly-academic practice... another is to
try to publish your and miekal's hypertext... technical difficulties rear
their ugly head here---there are more and more online journals looking for
such items, though this is limited to an html/java interface---but if the
ht is in, say, storyspace, you can always try a publisher like eastgate
(and storyspace exports to html, with some difficulties likely)... and yet
another way is to actually compose a (print!) justification for doing such
work... probably best to take all three tacks at once...

if i can help in any way, just let me know... i'm sure john cayley, jim
rosenberg and others on this list can help too... for what it's worth, i'm
faced mself with much the same problem...

Last time I had anything to do with contests, competitions, prizes
was in Korea. I was the New Zealand 'commissioner' for the CheChu
Biennale. An Asia-Pacific affair with Japan, Taiwan, Singapore,
Philipines, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand represented. And
there were prizes. I've never been involved in an exhibition with
prizes before. Although there's still one attached to the Venice
Biennale, it is definitely non-standard behaviour. Here at home
sponsors like this idea because 'competition' is belongs to a
'language they understand' and the arts don't, but equally because
its got PR value. 'And the winners are'. And this is why lots of us
don't like it--it makes a circus of what we do. But back to Korea,
not only was the media--swarms of roving video cameras, mainly, held
by men in Hawaiin-style shirts, while everyone else in the audience
except the artists from foreign countries were wearing dark suits--
there at the prize-giving, not only were the prizes given out by the
Governor of the Province, but also these chrome 'silver' platters in
red silked- lined, velvet-covered boxes, inscribed to the winners,
and ' medals' set in blocks of clear plastic in similar boxes for all
the artists. The Grand Prize went to one of the Korean artists, then
one artist from each of the other countries got a prize and platter,
too. Several hundred people were at this gathering which occurred at
10.30 in the morning. We all trooped out then and outside a brass
band was playing, and there were traditional dances, and there was a
flag-raising for the exhibition.  After than there was the ribbon-
cutting. I had a part to play in this. Along with the other
commissioners I was given a pair of white gloves and apair of sissors
with sheep-skin covered handles and altogether, at the count of
three, we cut this ribbon to 'open' the exhibition. However, it
didn't end here because there were three venues for the Biennale on
different parts of Chechu Island, so we spent the rest of the day on
buses going to these venues and repeating the speeches and the
ribbon-cutting.

But the connection between Tarfon and Kafka is not an accidental one at
all. Kafka would certainly have read Pirke Avot, and he was certainly
influenced by it. And, underlying the influence is something that makes it
possible and is of a more profound interest. To the wise a hint is sufficient.

In case no one has answered this: it's Rabbi Tarfon, as quoted in
Pirkei Avot 2:20. (The book can be found in English variously as
"Sayings of the Fathers" or "Ethics of the Fathers" or, in Rami
Shapiro's beautiful recent translation, as "Wisdom of the Jewish Sages".

pleasureTEXTpossession is online at my Qazingulaza site, so in that
sense it is accessible & published.  it is specifically a work in html
so Im not sure storyspace would coincide.  we have discussed a hardcopy
version, but this of course does nothing to address the legitimacy of
the virtual text.

probably best to take all three tacks at once...

personally feel that while Maria is probably not in a position to tweak
this situation to her advantage, that as an issue for writers in
electronic space these are the kinds of pigeonholing barriers that want
to put electronic writing in the same dusty file cabinet as concrete &
visual, sound, performance, & other traditional edges of poetrivance.

In any event, those 2 quotes went quite nicely together.  As for this
"other" issue -- must say I found the rhythms of the sentence in your
initial (san-other) version much better.  Don't know who this Geoerge
Alexander is (or if he wrote in English), but imho [as they say], the
"other" is (already) implicit & (thus) superfluous.  ALSO (more
importantly), without the word "other," the sentence has a
(considerably) greater startlement & twist of surprise to it.  With "other,"
one is too much set up for the sequel.

(Well there's my editorial opinion, in fine.)

The bias and perversity of this "Bad Writing" award was clear to me right
away, and the more I thought about it to be associated (with Jameson) and
the downfall of a certain kind of narrow English writing ("real thinking")
and the downfall, alas, of "English as an academic discipline" was
something to take (perverse) pleasure in.  The attack on language is, per
usual, a veiled attack on a differetn kind of thinking, another writing
style that would push against the limits of clarity, conformist
assumptions of social reality, and "common sense."  That I was writing
about the sublime cyborg, Robocop, and tried to give the sentences a
parodic feel of the postmodern machinic being would be lost on a lecturer
in the philosophy of art who cannot tell the sublime from the beautiful
nor Jameson from an idiot (or just resentful mediocrity?) like  himself.
The push was towards the "dialectical sentence" that trries to incorporate
the difficulty of grasping and reading the social into its very formation.
What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches, towards
Christchurch New Zealand to be born?  I do.  Rob Wilson

The University of Virginia now hosts complete archives of Humanist, a
humanities computing discussion list which first went online back in 1987
(an announcement from the folks responsible is forthcoming).

In the meantime, and in the context of this current Poetics thread, I offer
the following, one of the very earliest messages posted to Humanist:

I'm not sure what to add here, except that obviously legitimating online
publication has been an issue for longer than we usually imagine. Seems to
me that the real difference ten years has made is in the dialation of the
audiences for online work, rather than in its professional validation
(though I think there's hope there too).

Folks,


LINEbreak, the 1996 radio series hosted and co-produced
by Charles Bernstein, is now available at the Electronic
Poetry Center in easy-to-use RealAudio format.

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/linebreak

LINEbreak was a series of weekly performance/interview
programs featuring a wide array of poets and prose
writers (Robert Creeley, Susan Howe, Jackson Mac Low,
Bruce Andrews, Barbara Guest, Lyn Hejinian, Ray Federman,
Madeline Gins, Ron Silliman, Cecilia Vicua, Dennis
Tedlock, Steve McCaffery, Ted Pearson, Peter Straub,
Carla Harryman, Kenneth Sherwood, Loss Pequeo Glazier,
Jena Osman, Fiona Templeton, Luci Tapahonso, Ben
Yarmolinsky, Lance Olsen, Karen Mac Cormack, Ben
Friedlander, Paul Auster, Jerome Rothenberg, Hannah
Weiner, and Leslie Scalapino) which recently won a
national award for radio programming.

Programs and excerpts have been up for some time at the
EPC in other soundfile formats.  In recent weeks we've
made the switch to RealAudio which requires no
downloading of files (just click and listen).  If your
computer is not kitted out with RealAudio we've included
clear information on how to install it.  But if you have
any further questions about playing soundfiles on your
system don't hesitate to email me.

For those of you unfamiliar with the EPC, it is (by our
reckoning) the largest free  online collection of poetry
and poetics related material.  There is now, for example,
more than 20 hours of audio up at the EPC.  Use it!

Best,
Martin

the value of winning a prize or grant, it would seem to me, breaks down
into several aspects.  there's the actual money, which certainly is a
positive for whoever gets it.  then there's the endorsement value, if you
put it on your resume or whatever.  and finally, there's the psychic
income from "winning," competing, being chosen, etc.  if you get the
prize because it was wired for your before hand, then you certainly
don't get the third benefit, and the second type of value is diminished
to the extent that the "riggedness" is known, (and anyway, the person who
gave you the prize would probably give you a blurb quote or a letter of
recommendation for a job, etc, etc, so from the "prize" poiont of view
you aren't getting full value either if it was an inside job.  so there's
just the money, and that matters, but there are other ways of getting
money, would you rather Jorie Graham gave you $5,000 in prize money or
$10,000 for an easy gig as a "research assistant" where all you had to
was take books out of the library for her?  so patronage can be provided
in other ways as well.

when I was an undergraduate I won a poetry prize of some sort given by my
university, but since I figured that the sole creative writing professor
there had been the judge, I didn't think particularly much of it.  I
think I only entered because he asked me to, it was no big deal.  the
money was something like $50 and I guess I spent it on books right away.
on the other hand, a few years later, I was a CAPS semi-finalist -- never
got a cent, didn't win the prize, but the pleasure of being chosen by
some anonymous reader was much greater than winning the other thing & I'm
sure I boasted much more over the latter than the former.

May I suggest that the (yes, yes, all right,  'so-called') Iowa Writers
Workshop "network" is perhaps less like the nostalgic Mafia or the
international cartels presently taking over the globe, but rather like the
old Soviet Writers' Union?

Operating as it does in these laissez-the-fat-cats-faire Untied States (no
typo), it is of course not so tightly organized and not as clear about its
socio-aesthetico-political agenda, but you're either in it or you ain't.
 (Barry Goldensohn, bless his heart, pointed this out to me many years ago in
Iowa City: "You're just not *family*." )  Many decades of transmitted
experience in maneuvering alumni into key positions on prize (award,
fellowship) committees, writing program associations, and university press
boards are bound to bear fruit such as those described in Gwyn McVay's post.


One must admit, however, that one is more fortunate than poets such as
Arkadii Dragomoschenko and Ilya Kutik were in pre-1989 Russia: the Small
Press Distribution catalogue, the Buffalo Poetics Discussion Group, programs
at Brown and Buffalo, New College of California, The Jack Kerouac School of
Writing and Poetics at The Naropa Institute, etc.,  had no counterparts in
that place and time.

Thus, from the writing person's point of view, late-stage corporate
capitalism may be seen as preferable to Stalinism, in that it is closer to
medieval feudalism: troubadours hanging out with the "right" and
better-connected overlords probably stood a better chance of having their
works survive to be translated by (definitely non-"Iowa") Paul Blackburn on
smoky nights above McSorley's Saloon:

It is worthless to write a line
if the song proceed not from the heart:
nor can the song come from the heart
if there is no love in it. ...
A fool's love is like verse poor in the making,
only appearance and the name having,
for it loves nothing but itself, can
take nothing of good,
corrupts the rhyme.

And their singing is not worth a dime

Back to Epics briefly, i just purchased Kendrick Smithyman's Atua Wera,
which the blurb describes as "a New Zealand epic for the late twentieth
century."

Whatever, it seems to contain some good poetry & fascinating history, page
10 & so far thumbs up.

Susan,
Could you forward this to the "poetics list" so that they can get a fuller
sense of what-- ideologically, and in terms of language police-- these
"Bad Writing Awards" stand for?  Sayonara Tinfish, Rob

This was fowarded to me. So, in case you still haven't seen it, here it
is. And, I repeat: This is complementary. If you got nothing (that they
are envious of), then you got nothing to lose (or mock).

Bad Writing Contest Winners--

We are pleased to announce winners of the third Bad Writing
Contest, sponsored by the scholarly journal Philosophy and Literature
(published by the Johns Hopkins University Press) and its internet
discussion group, PHIL-LIT.

The Bad Writing Contest attempts to locate the ugliest, most
stylistically awful passage found in a scholarly book or article
published in the last few years.  Ordinary journalism, fiction, etc. are
not eligible, nor are parodies: entries must be non-ironic, from actual
serious academic journals or books.  In a field where unintended
self-parody is so widespread, deliberate send-ups are hardly
necessary.

This year's winning passages include prose published by established,
successful scholars, experts who have doubtless labored for years to
write like this.  Obscurity, after all, can be a notable achievement.  The
fame and influence of writers such as Hegel, Heidegger, or Derrida
rests in part on their mysterious impenetrability.  On the other hand,
as a cynic once remarked, John Stuart Mill never attained Hegel's
prestige because people found out what he meant.  This is a mistake
the authors of our our prize-winning passages seem determined to
avoid.

* The first prize goes to a sentence by the distinguished scholar
Fredric Jameson, a man who on the evidence of his many admired
books finds it difficult to write intelligibly and impossible to write
well.  Whether this is because of the deep complexity of Professor
Jameson's ideas or their patent absurdity is something readers must
decide for themselves.  Here, spotted for us by Dave Roden of Central
Queensland University in Australia, is the very first sentence of
Professor Jameson's book, Signatures of the Visible (Routledge, 1990,
p. 1):

"The visual is _essentially_ pornographic, which is to say that it has
its end in rapt, mindless fascination; thinking about its attributes
becomes an adjunct to that, if it is unwilling to betray its object; while
the most austere films necessarily draw their energy from the attempt
to repress their own excess (rather than from the more thankless
effort to discipline the viewer)."

The appreciative Mr. Roden says it is "good of Jameson to let readers
know so soon what they're up against."   We cannot see what the
second "that" in the sentence refers to.  And imagine if that uncertain
"it" were willing  to betray its object?  The reader may be baffled, but
then any author who thinks visual experience is essentially
pornographic suffers confusions no lessons in English composition
are going to fix.

* If reading Fredric Jameson is like swimming through cold porridge,
there are writers who strive for incoherence of a more bombastic
kind.  Here is our next winner, which was found for us by Professor
Cynthia Freeland of the University of Houston.  The writer is
Professor Rob Wilson:

"If such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the future as post-Fordist
subject, his palpably masochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the
sublime superstate need to be decoded as the
'now-all-but-unreadable DNA' of a fast deindustrializing Detroit,
just as his Robocop-like strategy of carceral negotiation and street
control remains the tirelessly American one of inflicting regeneration
through violence upon the racially heteroglossic wilds and others of
the inner city."

This colorful gem appears in a collection called The Administration of
Aesthetics: Censorship, Political Criticism, and the Public Sphere,
edited by Richard Burt "for the Social Text Collective" (University of
Minnesota Press, 1994).  Social Text is the cultural studies journal
made famous by publishing physicist Alan Sokal's jargon-ridden
parody of postmodernist writing.  If this essay is Social Text's idea of
scholarship, little wonder it fell for Sokal's hoax.  (And precisely what
are "racially heteroglossic wilds and others"?)   Dr. Wilson is an
English professor, of course.

* That incomprehensibility need not be long-winded is proven by our
third-place winner, sent in by Richard Collier, who teaches at Mt.
Royal College in Canada. It's a sentence from Making Monstrous:
Frankenstein, Criticism, Theory, by Fred Botting (Manchester
University Press, 1991):

"The lure of imaginary totality is momentarily frozen before the
dialectic of desire hastens on within symbolic chains."

* Still, prolixity is often a feature of bad writing, as demonstrated by
our next winner, a passage submitted by Mindy Michels, a graduate
anthropology student at the American University in Washington,
D.C.  It's written by Stephen Tyler, and appears in Writing Culture,
edited (it says) by James Clifford and George E. Marcus (University
of California Press, 1986).  Of what he calls "post-modern
ethnography," Professor Tyler says:

"It thus relativizes discourse not just to form--that familiar
perversion of the modernist; nor to authorial intention--that conceit
of the romantics; nor to a foundational world beyond discourse--that
desperate grasping for a separate reality of the mystic and scientist
alike; nor even to history and ideology--those refuges of the
hermeneuticist; nor even less to language--that hypostasized
abstraction of the linguist; nor, ultimately, even to discourse--that
Nietzschean playground of world-lost signifiers of the structuralist
and grammatologist, but to all or none of these, for it is anarchic,
though not for the sake of anarchy but because it refuses to become a
fetishized object among objects--to be dismantled, compared,
classified, and neutered in that parody of scientific scrutiny known as
criticism."

* A bemused Dr. Tim van Gelder of the University of Melbourne sent
us the following sentence:

"Since thought is seen to be 'rhizomatic' rather than 'arboreal,' the
movement of differentiation and becoming is already imbued with its
own positive trajectory."

It's from The Continental Philosophy Reader, edited by Richard
Kearney and Mara Rainwater (Routledge, 1996), part of an editors'
introduction intended to help students understand a chapter.  Dr. van
Gelder says, "No undergraduate student I've given this introduction
to has been able to make the slightest sense of it. Neither has any
faculty member."

* An assistant professor of English at a U.S. university (she prefers to
remain anonymous) entered this choice morsel from The Cultures of
United States Imperialism,  by Donald Pease (Duke University Press,
1993):

"When interpreted from within the ideal space of the myth-symbol
school, Americanist masterworks legitimized hegemonic
understanding of American history expressively totalized in the
metanarrative that had been reconstructed out of (or more accurately
read into) these masterworks."

While the entrant says she enjoys the Bad Writing Contest, she's
fearful her career prospects would suffer were she to be identified as
hostile to the turn by English departments toward movies and soap
operas.  We quite understand: these days the worst writers in
universities are English professors who ignore "the canon" in order
to apply tepid, vaguely Marxist gobbledygook to popular culture.
Young academics who'd like a career had best go along.

* But it's not just the English department where jargon and
incoherence are increasingly the fashion.  Susan Katz Karp, a
graduate student at Queens College in New York City, found this
splendid nugget showing that forward-thinking art historians are doing
their desperate best to import postmodern style into their discipline.
It's from an article by Professor Anna C. Chave, writing in Art
Bulletin (December 1994):

"To this end, I must underline the phallicism endemic to the dialectics
of penetration routinely deployed in descriptions of pictorial space
and the operations of spectatorship."

The next round of the Bad Writing Contest, results to be announced in
1998, is now open with a deadline of December 31, 1997.  There is an
endless ocean of pretentious, turgid academic prose being added to
daily, and we'll continue to celebrate it.

As one of the screeners for Jorie Graham's judging of the aforementioned AWP

thanks guyz, the problem isn't that my colleagues don't know about
technology. they teach courses in it, encourage us to do all kinds of
"online teaching" for extra $, and have endless seminars for us in whch we
are taught the wonders and glories of modern technology. we all have
highpowered computers in our offices whether we want them or not.
departmental business is routinely conducted by e-mail.  the problem is
that they don't like to give raises, and will use any excuse not to.  also,
the system is very much at the mercy of how well you get along with the
people on the merit review committee, how well you get along with the
chair, how these indivduals feel about the kind of work one does, etc. it's
all about petty internicene politics rather than any actual understanding
of the value of one's work.

I think Amato's long post was as always interesting and passionate and
worthwhile.  I've been a poet for decades and have never been within
lightyears of the academic world (being an un-degreed library worker in an
acadmic library is *very* far out of the loop of academe, so don't let my
"edu" fool ya)...So I can't speak to those concerns.  But there are a lot
of interesting points that keep occuring to me as I read this thread...On
the one hand there are a lot of folks who have done crucial work for the
benefit of all of us, with nea and other funding (such as Charles Alex.,
and his post speaks well to the current crisis that right-wing attacks on
social values are bringing to those operations); on the other hand there
have always been networks of publication and exchange and mutual support
that have existed *without* grant-type funding, and it may be that there
will be no option for the counterstream but to operate in that way,
increasingly.  Less mainstreamish approaches to poetry, such as I respond
to, have always been made to function with fewer resources, unfortuantely.
That's not in any way itself a good.  But if there is less capital
accumulated from a variety of public, tax-base, private and institutional
sources behind a given poetry mag, say, or publisher, then the physical
quality of the product will suffer, and of course distribution will suffer
big time; but it's true that in that case there is less "corrupt cronyism"
involved too--We support those we feel passionately are the poets we care
about, the poets we consider the best ones and the vital ones.  No doubt
I'm to be blamed for not doing a better job at finding grant and
institutional support for my projects...Before someone accuses me of it,
let me insist that I'm **not** recommending poverty and zamizdat and
sugared sonnets among friends, as a *preferable* option.  But it does
strike me that there are advantages to trying to build a dynamic
pluralistic democracy of poetry, on a shoestring.  Some of the tangled
questions, about where legitimate partisanship and cronyism divide (which
are very real problems, if you have been given institutional resources to
handle, I realize that) don't come up, for some who more outside
well-funded structures.
(...by the way, Joe, the comment made to you by one judge, that they could
always arrange the rejection of a ms. by sending to someone they knew were
out of sympathy, is *widely* known to happen in science, as well, one of a
number of dirty little secrets involved in the peer-review system)

Anselm, I'm sure you would also agree that it's also best just to focus
on one's own poetry and aesthetic integrity than to get caught up in
poetry politics. I can't imagine how else a poet with new ideas can cope.

I agree that it is wise to be aware of the cliques, but acceptance by an
"important person" within a clique doesn't change the poetry or the
editing (as in Mr. Hoover's case). Hoover's and Chernoff's 'zine is always
worth its cover price. There isn't any better criteria for me than that.

The issues I take with the anthology have more to do with the exclusion of
Zukofsky. If the Objectivists weren't included with the modernists or the
post-modernists, when and where will Norton put them. They claim that
Ashberry was the first big influence on the language poets, but as those
of us who got that 'zine way back when know, it was Gertrude Stein and
Louis Zukofsky who inspired them. And everyone was trying to fathom Clark
Coolidge. The anthology is generally full of really fine poems, but the
historical background given at the front of the book is not to my liking.

Anyhow, my real point is that Hoover's award from the Iowa camp is not any
kind of "selling out". For me it is good to see people of one armed camp
making peace with people from the other. It is good to disagree; that
helps us clarify our thoughts, but some of the warfare has been plain
ugly. Maybe this is a sign that things are improving. But probably not.
Mariani received much recognition on both sides for having written about
WCW, but the meter-beaters still don't give Williams his due. Maybe
Hoover's recognition is just a pat on the back for being published by
W.W.Norton. Norton does have a great distribution, and some great poets
are being read for the first time because of it. Messerli's anthology is
better, though, and I can't wait till Jerry and Pierre bestowed their
Volume II on us.

Concerning battles, I wonder, Anselm, if you see yourself in the thick of
it or on the outside. Are you, in your own view, more of a Shaw or a
Dickenson. Your work has certainly been called up in the middle of heated
arguments. My guess is that you'd rather just stay cool and work on your
own vision.

Re: roughing it with the beast in his new clothes...

        Rob Wilson's defense of a "style that would push against the
limits of
clarity, conformist assumptions of social reality, and 'common
sense.'... [a] push toward the 'dialectical sentence' that tries to
incorporate the difficulty of grasping and reading the social into its
very formation" strikes me as clear and readable. Does that defeat its
purpose? His sentence from The Administration of Aesthetics [in the
message forwarded by Simon Schuchat], while not as opaque as Jameson's,
lives up to its purpose only too well, to exclusion of anyone not in
"the social" milieu which Wilson inhabits or seeks to establish. The
question in another thread [on the NEA] about how to distinguish
advocacy from cronyism seems apposite here. Should we admire preaching
to the converted? Or bamboozling the Great Unwashed with hoo-hah?
        Objections to bad writing go back at least to George Orwell's
"Poilitcs
and the English Language" (e.g., his example of Harold Laski's contorted
quintuple negative from "Freedom of Expression"!). The message: CYP
(cover your petard)--a point well taken, if taken well, Polonius might
say. Presumably, Professor Laski--writing well before the present vogue
for 'oppositional' syntax--meant to clarify something by his sentence,
but failed; thus, Orwell rightly condemned his sentence as bad writing.
If Wilson or Jameson seek to obscure something--and succeed--should they
receive praise for having written "good" sentences?
Since when does the intention of a sentence qualify its merit? [If it
did, all our students would get "A"s!]. And if no one can figure out
what the sentence tried to obscure, defer, "problematize" [ugh] or "push
against" in the first place, how should one judge whether it has
succeeded or not?
        Not that Professor Dutton has any greater claim to "real
thinking" than
Jameson or Wilson, but at least he says what he says clearly--or tries
to, and if he doesn't succeed, one can specify where and why.
        Some of the impulse for the kind of writing Dutton knocks (as no
doubt
Orwell would, too) seems to derive from the view of critics like Stanley
Fish that criticism constitutes a higher 'art form' than literature &
so, presumably, has carte blanche to exploit its methods.
Fish, however, writes clearly enough--and interestingly--most of the
time. Perhaps Marx (ever actually read Capital?) gives the turgid turn
another twist: with the Cold War over and no hope of military
insurrection against RoboWar, the pen--no matter how leaky or
blotchy--still looks "mightier than the sword." But hey: who reads this
stuff? The huddled masses? "Blind mouths"? Hardly. But much of it seems
doomed to "fall on deaf (or deafened) ears."
        I don't see this as a case of "I knew Gedrtrude Stein. Gertrude
Stein
was a friend of mine...," but I do agree with Mark Baker that Jameson
"at least in this sentence... wrote very badly," and I see nothing wrong
in saying so about Jameson or anyone else. No doubt those so chided can
ably defend themselves--though one may not sympathize entirely with
their defenses, as I don't with Wilson's, however clearly he expressed
it.
        Anyhow,
waiting for the pie barrage,
Dan Zinmmerman

BOOKEND:  ANATOMIES OF A VIRTUAL SELF

Joe Amato

"_Bookend_ sets the stage for a new kind of writing.  Part poetry, part
theory, part scholarly exegesis, Joe Amato's book cruises the Information
Network, sweeping along, in its rush toward revelation, the flotsam and
jetsam of daily life---especially life in the academy---as it is playing
itself out in the 1990s.  The various 'anatomies,' especially the Anatomy
of a Heart, allow us to enter the author's consciousness, and yet _Bookend_
remains curiously depersonalized.  Amato tells stories, ruminates on
poetics, works on his computer, and arranges every page visually as well as
verbally.  The lettrist 'breakdown' of the last pages is thus entirely
anticipated."

Marjorie Perloff, Sadie Dernham Patek Professor of Humanities, Stanford
University

"Joe Amato's passionate, acrobatic, and audacious engagement with the
limits of discursiveness aims to repixelate our reception of virtual
culture.  Like a test pattern coming from just beyond the Gutenberg Galaxy,
_Bookend_'s static is a call for us to readjust our sets."

Charles Bernstein, David Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters, State
University of New York at Buffalo

"Situated somewhere between the world of print and cyberspace, Amato's
_Bookend_ is an amazing read---fast, provocative, learned, hypertextual,
fun.  The work departs from standard academic discourse but is at the same
time astonishing in its breadth.  Part poem, part narrative, part academic
argument, Amato uses a wide range of contemporary scholarship to inform his
thinking.  Yet the book elicits a personal rather than a cerebral response.
Through considerations of family, ethnicity, computers, sexuality, lived
experience, Amato brings mind and culture to bear on the construction of
self."

Gail E. Hawisher, Professor of English and Director of the Center for
Writing Studies, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign

"The verbal energy, intelligence, intensity, and integrity of the vision in
this book are compelling.  The author brings seemingly contrary texts,
concerns, linguistic practices, and discourse to bear upon fundamental
problems of our culture, the humanities, and poetics in an almost
hypertextual matrix of narrative, philosophical, playful and poetic
discourses.  This is a difficult book aware of its joys; a joyful book
aware of its difficulties."

I'm pretty suspicious of reliable denotation and efficient communication.
It's probably because I was born after advertising, mass media, psychology
and politics fused.

Following the whole Paul Hoover/Marvin Bell post fiasco, I find myself
returning to what I think was a primary point in Kent Johnson's original
post.  I respect what everyone has said about Paul Hoover and certainly do
not begrudge any award he gets nor do I want to cast dispersions about Marvin
Bell (whom I know very little about) and his reasons for supporting Hoover's
work.  However, I am, at a more theoretical level, concerned with possible
outcomes of such perceived alliences.  In many areas, poetry being one, I am
certainly interested in people of differing ideas recognizing the value of
each others work but I am also cynical of it, having seen the result in non-
poetry cases--thinking here of some of the falseness I about toward American
(often middle-class, often white) liberalism.

Not that it's happened in the Hoover case (or, quite frankly, any case I can
think of), but I guess hearing the story makes me wonder, is there going to
be some payoff expected?  Is someone like Paul Hoover going to be expected to
hold out the olive branch to more conservative writers?  Of course, the
question comes--are there more conservative writers who deserve awards?  This
would seen tied to questions (is my (or Paul Hoover's or anyone's) judgement
about what is "good" poetry tied to "tastes" or other factors?) too complex
for this post .  More important to me would be is this how contests are run?

I have yet to win any sort of award and I recognize that the struggle to get
recognition through awards, publications, etc. is different that that of
maintaining a reputation once you have a few awards, etc.--certainly the
contests are usually different.  I suppose a possible fear I have when I read
posts about cronyism is that both types of contests are about poets who
already have positions and "reps" working to maintain these positions and
"reps"

Interesting, but I note two types of posts have occured as a result of the
Hoover/Bell and Jorie Graham posts--those which question thier motives,
judgements, alliances, etc. (and give off the impression of not knowing the
individuals involved) and the "I know this person and you are wrong" posts.
Of course, if I thought a poet I knew and respected was somehow called into
question I'd proabably write a "I know this person, how dare you" type of
post, and I suppose posts which claim "yeah, I know so-and-so and you
_should_ questions their motives" wouldn't be taken very seriously, but I
wonder what, if any, cronyism underlies even these exchanges.

George: Thanks for the info. At some point "epic" as genre-definition
crystalized, and remained largely unchanged for almost two millenia in the
west. What troubled me was what I saw as the imposition of the etymology of
a loan word as _meaning_ onto later usage in the context of the borrower
languages.

Jameson? I admire his mind. But there's no excuse for bad writing. In this
case I think he uses the opacity of his style to mask a confusion or
conflation of categories: visual=voyeur=pornography.
I _could_ translate the sentence in question.

A few words of Jameson's might be of interest to those following the
"Bad Writing" and "Jameson's Prose" threads.  This is a passage Jameson
wrote regarding Bertolt Brecht and Walter Benjamin's "Plumpes Denken",
and the putting forth of arguments in plain language.  He argues that
their plain form of argument is a historical phenomenon, a necessary
reaction to the obscurity of a more Hegelian Marxism.  That was 21 years
ago -- I wonder if we might now have reached a similar point in history,
and if the (unfair, narrow-minded, bullying) PHIL-LIT material might be
viewed as the nastier side of this phenomenon.

It may or may not be relevant that I write this as someone who:

A) Thinks _The Political Unconscious_ is one of the most profound books
of criticism to appear in my lifetime.
B) Does not want to emulate the prose style of the later Jameson.
C) Went to graduate school during a time when Jameson was presented as
an authoritative, rather than a radically marginal, figure in literary
and cultural studies.
D) Was asked to desubscribe from PHIL-LIT a couple of years ago over a
post I wanted to make about deconstruction.

Jameson:

"I think that the problem lies in this, that we are always _in
situation_ with respect to class and ideology and cultural history, that
we are never able to be mere blank slates, and that truth can never
exist as a static system, but always has to be part of a more general
process of _demystification_.  This, in its simplest form, is the
justification and the essence of the dialectical method; and the proof
is that even _plumpes Denken_ takes its value from the intellectual
positions which it corrects -- the overcomplicated Hegelianism or
philosophic Marxism for which it substitutes some hard truths and plain
language.  So _plumpes Denken_ is not a position in its own right
either, but the demystification of some prior position from which it
derives its acquired momentum and of which it comes as a genuinely
Hegelian _Aufhebung_ or cancellation/transcendence"

This from the essay "Criticism in History" in Norman Rudich's excellent
and hard-to-find anthology _Weapons of Criticism: Marxism in America and
the Literary Tradition_ (Palo Alto: Ramparts Press, 1976).

Are we about to see the emergence (not just on the right) of a new
_plumpes Denken_?  At least two conditions seem right for it:

1) we have a complicated and abstruse philosophical Marxism now, which
may be generating its own Brechts and Benjamins

and

2) with fewer grants and more financial pressures, the presses that have
supported this criticism are looking for ways to be more accessible and
therefore more profitable


Like Daniel Zimmerman, waiting for the pie barrage (or should I say, the
cancellation/transcendence of my position),

Robert Archambeau


PS: The passage above is proof that Jameson can be lucid when he wants
to be.

                  Are you there SCOTT POUND?
                  Are you a Buffalo person too?

Count me as one who'd like to see this happen and for whom "accessible" is
not necessarily a dirty word.

But -- to twist the question a little -- are people entirely sanguine
about seeing Benjamin JUST as a link in the chain of philosophical
Marxism? I've always thought the Gershom Scholem Kabbalistic side of his
thought at least as fascinating; in fact, that he combines these two
strands at all may be the most fascinating thing about him! Interesting
seeing Brecht and Scholem in a tug-of-war for his affections.

Kabbala can get pretty abstruse too, of course . . .


P.S. and entirely off the radar range: I'm number 99 on the Seattle Public
Library wait list for *Mason & Dixon* so won't be able to join that
discussion for a while, but instead picked up last week Brad Gooch's bio
of Frank O'Hara *City Poet*. Has this book been discussed on the list at
all? Does anyone have any strong opinions about it one way or the other?
Been reading it in light of recent posts about cronyism and, of course,
gossip . . . backchannels fine.

nothing wrong w/ accessibility; but one question shd be: accessible to
whom, under what circumstances, etc?  accessibility and the politics
thereof are not transparently self-evident.

Dale here from Hoa's machine:

Etymology is not a science with exact definition.  Its goal is to show the
history of a word's usage.  It seems to me that a word is only "defined" through
its usage and changes over time  for a variety of reasons. As a poet, I find the
historical weight of words fascinating and essential to how I understand
language.   Rather than defining a word's meaning, the etymological process is
more like measuring historical transmutations.  Knowing how a word was once used
offers important contrast to the meanings we apply to the same words now.
Besides, an etymological dictionary is necessry for my understanding of poetry
from any period.  But of course, these tools are relied upon more and more the
further back you go in the language.

Abandon freshman comp. teaching, all you grant-deprived poets!
The writer's terms are the style; the logic of Jameson's prose is the
logic of his style.  Ain't that the point of it?  Why else write the
way he does?  He does it purposely, so criticizing the style (or agreeing
with it by imitating it) is doing pretty much what you want people to
look for.  That's why most people on the List suspect ideological bias in
Dutton's contest:  the contest criticizes the style because it don't like
the argument (which, again, is the style, as we who get pleasure in
merely circulating say).

Or do you mean *conventional* standards of style are irrelevant?
Yup, or at least too limited, because they limit receptivity to
different arguments.  But not style itself.

Mark - loved your Augustan stanza. In my view, academic treatises,
philosophy, etc. are based on a transparent non-style.  Now I know
Plato-lovers etc. are already up in arms.  But the nonstyle is the
transparent ground-bass(?).  It's utilitarian prose transmitting ideas,
the aim is not to seduce with the felicities of the language per se.
That's why the platonic dialogues are so wonderful : it's extraneous
pleasure.  Each philosopher has her or his own gorgeous individual
excellent eccentric STYLE, yes, which may be a rhetorical checkmate
but not a logical proof.  But these academic explainers (Jameson et al)
with their pompous turgid theories don't make it as philosophers. & how
sad it is for a POETICS list to even have to deal with them, I say.
Winston Curnow, your recent post on your problems with dirtying your hands
in the "circus" of award/publication PR are relevant here!  What a parade
of fools the whole poetry industry really is, more truly than you think!
You're in it deeper than you know!  To think that entire "schools" of
experimental poetry could arise flavored with the pure pomposity of
academic "engage"  "theorists" and "critics"!!  & that good Brother Anselm
could single out Naropa, Buffalo, and Brown, etc. as regions of political
purity and poetic liberation!  Believe me, the false prestige of the
established literati (Amer. Acad. of Arts & Letters, Iowa, etc.) - the
whole sense of "falseness" there - is based on these poets' LACK of
a necessary narrative.  The charm of Homer, Ariosto, Milton, even,
is that their gifts were bent under the weight of economic & political
necessity unto death.  This is the charm of their work at work!
Same goes for Villon!  We live in an Empire, gang, anything goes,
it all goes.  To think that the Language Poets or the [fill-in-the-
blank] School are going to purify the language of the tribe by
devoting themselves to Right Doctrine & Politique is the laugh of
the end-of-century!  Let's talk about the glories of Jameson's
PC style, huh poets?? To hell with all them critics. - Henry Gould

But what if there is no such mastery? What if the text is
incomprehensible? What if it separates demographics on the
basis of the master's vocabulary?

Or should we all accept the role of either ignorance or
discipleship?

In fact there are situations where one _does_ require in-
formation, and it's simply in too obscure a form for most
people to be useful - computer papers are an example.

Finally, on what basis is "style" equated with writing's com-

I don't find Jameson turgid at all, but highly provocative and often, very
lucid. Far more lucid, say, than Derrida. But I like what Henry is saying
here, which, if I may extrapolate, seems to be that all criticism - and all
writing - aspires to the condition of poetry. As Valery remarks in his
"Introduction to the Method of Leonardo daVinci," (I paraphrase): in the
end, what remains of the gorgeous systems of a Plato, a Spinoza, if not a
work of art?

He goes on to say that this is why we continue to read them: not as "proofs
of life" or whatever, but because of the example of their beauty. But
"critical thought" can and does reach the level of the poetic - I'm thinking
of Barthes' _A Lover's Discourse_ and _Empire of Signs_, of Derrida's _The
Post Card_. And of course, Charles Bernstein's _A Poetics_.  All "criticisms
of life." All "poetic."

Something btw I don't find Jameson supplying at all - he seems not to have
that particular gift. But I still enjoy reading him, esp. when I disagree
with him (as for instance with the beginning of _Signatures_.)

That's why the platonic dialogues are so wonderful : it's extraneous
pleasure.  Each philosopher has her or his own gorgeous individual
excellent eccentric STYLE, yes, which may be a rhetorical checkmate
but not a logical proof.  But these academic explainers (Jameson et al)
with their pompous turgid theories don't make it as philosophers. & how
sad it is for a POETICS list to even have to deal with them, I say.

Patrick : interesting, because total, misreading of what I said.  Makes
me wonder about my own ability to express myself.
I don't think all writing aspires to poetry.  I think critical analysis
& philosophy are distinct activities - they are not poetry.  What I was trying
to say was that in a democratic world the justification of poetry by
means of an academic critique of socio-political structures is the
ultimate circus carnival of a self-promotional hyped-up market empire.

Poetry is something else.  Closer to Ventadour/Blackburn's concept of
the singing heart.  But even CLOSER to something more allegorical &
literary: Ariosto, for example.  Another courtly poet singing for his
meals.

Coleridge's Seventh Lecture on Shakespeare begins, "In a former lecture
I endeavoured to point out the union of the Poet and Philosopher," a
sentence that recalls Wordsworth's notion in the Preface that poetry is
"more philosophical" than history. So does it make any sense to frame
the discussion of Jameson's "bad prose" in these Romantic terms? Is
Jameson a philosopher striving toward a sort of poetic condition of
language, or just a bad stylist? The distinction between difficulty and
sludge has been discussed here, but what about clarity? Some of
Dickinson's poems, for instance, are difficult sometimes to the point of
incomprehensibility at the level of the sentence, while remaining
"clear"; and in philosophy Wittgenstein can be hard to parse even while
being absolutely plain-spoken. Which goes to show, I think, that Bad
Writing Contests--and who *enters* them, so are they contests?--are, as
has been said here, a political crock. Which is not to say, btw, I think
Jameson's sentence is all that *clear* not in fact all that difficult.
Clearly (ha!), the Commonwealth academics who set up the "competition"
(the word itself is a lie in this usage) just don't like theory.

How different is the language-game we call poetry from the language-game

or: is it the difference between walking thru a landscape so that

who was it (what poet) said he found philosphy a bit embarrassing? --

that poetry should "resist the intellect, almost" [or words to that

a familiar quote -- I don't remember from whom -  W.Stevens?)

philosophy & poetry:  sense & sensibility ?

philosophy was rounding the bases but never arriving
poetry was way out in left field -- watching the blimp

then poetry hit a Homer
& philosophy sat bemused

poetry bunts & dives for first (down & dirty)
philosophy -- a nervous pitcher -- tends to spit

when poets brag about stealing bases
philosophers will try to catch 'em out

the catcher makes cryptic signals (poetry)
the pitcher follows instructions (philosophy)

the crowd (philosophy) goes wild!
the bases (poetry) are now loaded!

who can master the screwball?

the stadium (philosophy) empty
dusk: the game (poetry) is over

the beer can (philosphy) lies crushed
crackerjack (poetry) fades from memory

even the gift was a mere trinket -- at the bottom
of popcorn (philosphy) and the coating (poetry)

philosophy was too occupied with the score
poetry was too enamoured of the fanfare

poetry left to take a leak
when philosophy was up at bat

when the kid (poetry) returned to his seat
the player (philosophy) had been walked

no one knew for sure how this happened
prudence (philosophy) or guile (poetry)?

i agree with mark baker: the writer's terms are the style.  suppose i want
to talk about "otherness" -- at what point am i then justified in talking
about alterity, non-identity, heterogeneity?  if my style, or even what
henry calls my non-style (the transparent figure-ground, h.?), demands
that i introduce these additional terms, i would hope it's because they
give me and my reader something that the original term lacks.

what if reader x doesn't pick up the valences behind one of the
terms -- say, heterogeneity -- their fault or mine?  should i expect
reader x to then feel hopelessly underread and forced to go back and
read everything from hegel's science of logic to bataille in order to
return to my text more valence-friendly?  i think i at least have a
responsibility to use my style responsibly, in other words:

if i start talking about "otherness predicated upon its dialectical
overdetermination by a radically heterogeneous alterity" i truely hope you
as my reader will find me my copy-editor and my publisher and shake us
violently demanding an explanation of what the hell i'm talking about
else banish us to a lifetime of reading nothing but postings to the spoons
collective's bataille list as punishment...

Dale has nicely laid out the important distinction betw etymology and
usage, and in an admirably brief post. Of course we don't [necessarily]
need etym. to interpret a contemporary poem; we can rely on our native
competence. The reason why philologists are prone to over-value etym. is
that often it is our only tool. We can't rely on native competence when it
comes to Vedic [a dead lang], and usage can't be a tool when it is
precisely a word's usage that we are trying to figure out. But good
philologists are as sensitive to this distinction as good poets are.

As for "epos", I think etym has steered me in the right direction, toward a
more accurate understanding of the word's usage.

not to take rob wilson's side (and yes---i respect rob's insights, his
ability to talk theory), but let's say we decided to accept as valid
something called "theoretical discourse in the academy"... and let's say we
decided to gauge the "value" of each such tract or assertion on the basis
of the work it did (no need to write "theoretical work" here!) in that
context, in those communities... what would "good" writing be?...

i don't think there's an ez answer, though there may be some answers... we
can agree, i think, that rob's writing (and jameson's---and why isn't
jameson online?---i've never caught him online---rob, it should be
observed, is at least *here*) is not ez, or "clear," in the context of what
a majority of (even articulate) writers might find "clear"... we might even
argue that there is a better way to say what rob is saying... but first,
first we'd have to answer the question of who the intended audience is...
even if "the intended audience is always a fiction," the alternative is
not, cannot be to ask that *all* writing that purports at some level to be
theoretical be accessible to all readers, can it?... can it really?... from
the point of view of even modest reception theory, i don't think so...

for example:  do we ask the same of theoretical physicists?... clearly
[wink], in science, the obscurity gives offense is generally acknowledged
to be the concepts and "nouns" themselves, and what they denote (and note
michael berube's fine piece in _the chronicle_ a while back, "in defense of
obscurity" or some such, his mla talk---very un-obscure!)... we assume,
even allowing that the rhetoric of science is itself constructive of
scientific knowledge, that an essay in the scientific community will of
necessity employ concepts that constitute insider or expert knowledge...
and in general we seem to respect same---we don't run around publicly
chastising (not most of us anyway) physicists for using terms like "charm
physics" (no shit---charm physics!)... the bind of course is that
theoretical work in the humanities, as any other writing-based endeavor, IS
in so many ways the writing... the work is not accomplished 'beforehand'
and written-up (and again, more sophisticated appreciations of science
indicate that even science doesn't work quite this way---but my point has
to do with general perceptions)... the enacting of a theoretical piece in
the humanities IS or can be in so many ways the theory... it was ward tietz
i think who (some time ago in these spaces) articulated this
descriptive/theoretical conundrum quite expertly, for my money (wish i
could find his post, have it somewhere or other)...

most of us hereabouts appreciate the fact that a poem cannot really be
paraphrased... perhaps poets aspire to different aims (as henry suggests)
but we'd have at least to allow that theorists, whatever they aspire to in
such terms, can very well aspire to not being paraphrased... who's to say
otherwise?... i might be irked by theorists or critics who claims poetic
ground (plug:  if you read my suny book you'll understand why---maybe!) but
only b/c this ground is claimed generally w/o regard for poets...

as to the idea of what is "good" writing:  are any of you (mostly academics
probably) familiar with steven b. katz's essay, "the ethic of expediency:
classical rhetoric, technology, and the holocaust"?... appeared in _college
english_ in march 1992... katz begins by examining a piece of "good" (i.e.,
expedient) technical writing authored by an ss group leader, detailing
technical changes necessary to alter vans used to gas jews before the
"final solution" (i.e., large-scale crematoria)... technically the memo (in
translation) is quite "clear"---except of course for the use of words such
as "pieces" to describe human beings... katz in fact traces the rhetorical
tendency toward "expedient" writing back to poor old aristotle, and gives
some idea as to how this ethos was imported into national socialist
propaganda, and tech writing theory and practice... this essay raised lots
of eyebrows when it appeared, won much acclaim, and in my view has not been
confronted sufficiently in most tech writing classrooms (many of which do
not in my view sufficiently theorize technology)...

anyway, my point should be obvious enough:  that "good" writing---like
"bad" writing---implies a moral-political judgment... now i'm not against
making such judgments---but they need to be understood as such... and when
you hear somebody running around using the term "bad writing" as though
style can be unproblematically separated from "content"---as though "bad"
is 'merely' a stylistic denotation---well that in itself should give one
reason to pause...

that said:  if i were to critique rob's long sentence *in public*---a
sentence peppered with critical vocabulary that can, for the
theoretically-inclined/informed reader, connote multiple theoretical
reference points---i think i would, first, have to argue publicly why
theoretical discourse should be more "accessible" to some "lay" public
(even as such discourse interrogates the popular)... and even were i able
to construct such an argument, one likely oriented to the fraught 'public
intellectual' debates, such an argument (theory?) should not be used to
delimit "theory" as such, as a field of possibilities... in any case, once
such an argument were made, the values i would bring to suggested revisions
would at least be operating at the surface of discussion...

whether having to be "clear" about such motivations is "where" we are in
critical-theoretical terms, at this moment in academic culture (robert's
question, as i understood him), i'm not sure... my guess is that we might
as academics find some helpful room to move through a more performative
understanding of what we are about... but u.s. culture is predisposed
toward posing [he sez], both in and out of the academy, so i'm not going to
wax entirely optimistic on this count...

i hope i don't sound as though i'm beating around the bush... rob's
sentence, for me, pointed in lots of directions, but i did find it
difficult to read... that somebody with ulterior motives should have
singled it out, with a few other such sentences, as "bad" doesn't
necessarily mean that we can't learn from same... but maybe a better way
for "us" to learn here would be for me to say to rob (if i may) "yeah man,
that was a tough swallow"... and if rob valued my opine, perhaps he'd think
it over, perhaps not... at least we may then have had an exchange (if rob
respects my judgment, which i think he does), and at least i wouldn't be
pointing my finger as such... and rob of course would be *free* not to
revise!... as to public finger pointing:  again i ask, in such terms, what
*are* the motives here?...

if, as i take it, our theories do not---should not, cannot
really---*legislate* life, neither should a given desire for linguistic
accessibility or convention---which comprises in fact somebody's lived
experience---be used to *legislate* theory...

geez i wish i weren't so long-winded, sorry!...

best,

I was trying to point poetry away from the dull marriage of left theory
and experimental verse.  Did I succeed?  Only Harmon Killibrew in heaven can

had to be harnessed to the narrative/song/occasion demands of its patrons.
This NECESSITY is what tempers the poetry - brings it to a concrete
and complex beauty & wholeness.  Ariosto is my mantra exemplar of the day.
Now we live in a democratic age & poetry thrives under the sign of

whose promoters distance themselves from bourgois values on the one hand
and decry at the same time the inadequate prestige & rewards extended to
them from the bearers of those bourgois values, are the icing on the

the verse at all.  There is only the inner necessity of the poetic impulse;
the outside is all imperial pomp & flatulence; the outside is pure freedom
& neglect.  But indifference & neglect can be a GOOD thing for artists.
Can we find the NECESSITY to match our creative impulses? Who knows,

All I can say is the spirit of poetry should be sought in the great works

David Israel's riffing certainly demonstrates one distinction between
poetry and philosophy: poetry / metaphor sponsors copia, expansion and
variation, whereas philosophical language (at its best) tends to narrow
to a point. Which of course does not imply that poetry cannot take ideas
as its material.

Still, and though I brought up Coleridge and Wordsworth, I worry about
Henry's and David's veer toward romanticism.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Although this thread can lead nowhere save back to the skein -- there being
no disinterested parties -- here are at least a couple of other ways to
look at the question of defined groups and their influence on distribution
of reward in the world of poetry.

(I should -- and do -- interrupt myself to mention that personally I find
it hard to apply to foundations, seek fellowships, go to conferences, work
relationships to get critical attention, etc., although I think these are
value-neutral activities. I never accepted a scholarship in college or even
a loan, driving my parents crazy and causing a lot of part-time jobs on my
part. My whole family had been destroyed in Europe by institutions which
just didn't seem all that different to me from the ones I was forced to
relate to in growing up and in living an adult life -- that's not a
comparison, btw, it's just me.)

1. Everybody helps their friends. Who else should they help? I'm sure Jorie
Graham sees some young poet emerging from her classes as gifted, needy, and
worthy. Should she not promote that person's career if it's possible for
her to do so? I see my friends do that all the time, and I do it too --
proposing and promoting some young(er) person's work -- and if you feel
like seeing that as promoting one above another who may be as or more
worthy, you're probably right but so what.

The following is NOT a criticism: Take a look at the list for Charles'
LINEBREAK program. What's the total of years of friendship among the people
on that list -- a millenium possibly! Who should Charles invite if not his
friends. In poetry, friendship usually also means a high regard for the
work and even (sometimes) a history of mutual influence and various kinds
of poetic working together.

Would it be better for Charles or Jorie Graham or whoever to cede the
operation of mind to some bureaucratic procedure? Usually we want the other
guy to do that, our workings seem utterly embedded and natural.

2. Anselm is right that these cozy worlds are like the Soviet Writers Union
(altho without the extremity of influence or function -- it was a writers
union hack who spent the evening at the Mandelstams making sure they were
present for the arrival of the cops). But, these are multiple such worlds.
And their structure is one of mutual back-scratching -- again, how could it
be otherwise?

At the same time, if you put yourself where there is little you can do for
others you may not find they do much for you. That's probably a good sign.

Remember this: any structure of power is threatened by any real and new
work. A benign sphere of influence is as threatened as any other. Spheres
of influence are settled structures. A new locus of force disrupts their
workings. This is no less true at Buffalo than it is at Iowa. People on
this list simply prefer the aesthetic at Buffalo, as do I.

(I interrupt myself one more time to point out that the above analysis
doesn't stop over details -- it could be fleshed out, theoretically and
empirically; it could be supported with evidence, and it could be made
conclusive. It could even be an attack, but it isn't one.)

3. It would be worth investigating the role of criticism, specifically
academic criticism, in the workings of these worlds in which prizes are
handed and positions doled to prince and dolt alike. I'm not going to do
it, tho I could.

4. Rotating the aesthetics. The problem is that you have to create a
mechanism to rotate the aesthetics, and a human mechanism is just another
layer of who knows whom.

MY CONCLUSION -- (I rely, by the way, entirely on my own advice and
analysis. Those considering whether and how to weigh it should consider my
position and ask whether and how they would wish to emulate it. If you
wouldn't wish to I don't blame you, go on and dress for the party.
Whatshishername may be there.) ---

Look, what has poetry to do with any of this?

(In Jewish theology, one position holds that all miracles took place before
the world was created, although they may appear to be taking place in our
lives. The same position holds that every moment is miraculous and that on
the other hand every miracle in your life reduces your merit in the world
to come.)

It has nothing to do with it; it has as little to do with it as humanly
possible. All prizes received, all positions defined, held, and extended,
all of that reduces your merit as a poet.

(Except of course for the exceptions [of course]... and we are on our way
out of a plain look at the truth)

Good luck! Oh, and it *is* good to eat. Not all prize money is wasted. I
know some poets who got to participate in the real estate boom in the SF
bay area in the late seventies because they got NEA grants. Now that's
leveraging money for the arts!

True, but there are more direct ways of helping that do not have to involve
unfair practice, which I think applies the AWP situation. JG could, for
example, lobby her own publisher to publish a student's work, or persuade
Colorado Review Press -- she's the poetry editor at CR -- to publish it,
put in a good word for the student with editors of other mags, writing
positive reviews, etcetera. I don't find anything wrong with this kind of
private lobbying -- it's how the literary world works, very often it does
spring from honest admiration for the work, and it's likely that some
wonderful poets would never have come to our various attentions without it.
We have in the AWP case, however, an "open" contest whose sponsors trumpet
its being blind-judged (as does the NEA) and the contestants -- however
naive -- trust to that. JG violated that trust.

p.s.: the "veer" (above) is interesting --

what was the right course / high road from which I / we present a
troubling divergence, a wrong-track trek, I wonder?

Romanticism, though, will never be the same (nor, for that matter,
nostalgia).  It's a new ballgame now, not to mention a whole nother
ball of wax.

There's also the hardball / softball distinction (philosophy v.
poetry, presumably).  But poetry is sometimes more like pool --

it's the strategic bounces that count (or at least most amaze).  And
when things get too heated, you can always head for the high dive.

Seriously, the dialogue between philosophy & poetry seems one of the
most vital of literate dialogues -- even if each end has its own ways of
decontextualizing & re-, of listening & not, its own modes of
presentation & interpretation, etc.  W.Stevens seems among the most
interesting of modern walkers of those borderlands.  But many of the
fine stuff from langpo-land also take on a much wider / broader
swatch at / from philosophy than (mere, -- if you'll allow this)
Marxism.  Think of Rosemarie Waldrop, Joan Retallack, Michael Palmer
(as instances) . . .

BTW, are folks familiar w/ F. Schiller's *Naieve & Sentimental*
essay?  Any neo-romanticism presumably takes things at new (more
distant & complex) levels of what Schiller called "the sentimental"
-- but his sense of that seems far from the word as generally used in
this century.  Anyway, Joseph, I'll wear the R badge w/ a difference.

  Sometimes one carries a sharp machete
     & chops away at green (romanticism)
  sometimes one takes a dull wit & plants
     seedlets in fecund soil (postmodernity)

many climates allow for many modes
the full gamut issuing many a scale . . .

Sometimes surely true -- but there are counter instances in each camp.

For copiousness of philosphers, what abt. Schaupenhauer? (& I dare
say -- from what bits I've read -- the chap does present philosophy
"at its best" or at least pretty darn good.)

For terseness / compactness / bullion of poets -- what about (say)
Paul Celan?  (or so many other instances, even the prolific WCW)

> Which of course does not imply

Nor that philosophy cannot don beautiful & comely language.

Still, if the Rome might sometimes seem the same, the Road does
generally diverge.  Who'll get there first (& what they'll do if they
ever arrive) is an open question.

But evidently they're indeed (as suggested) different games.

Considering how exaggerated music is -- considering how coolheaded
philosophy is -- considering how outlandish poetry is -- the three
make a fine triangle, ready for chiming

d.i.

But Tom, isn't the difference between what Jorie Graham reportedly did
as judge in an open competition, and what Bernstein does in promoting
his friends (if that's what he does) on his radio program, just the
thing that turns poetry into propoganda and institutions into mafias -
i.e., bad faith?  How can you deride institutions and in the same sentence
defend what makes you suspicious of them?  Bernstein doesn't run a contest
that claims to take your money in exchange for a fair consideration of
your work.  Most poets know it's a crap shoot & judges have their own
biases - but again, how can you equate the two?

Philosophy aims for the exquisite equation;
poetry for the pointed proverb.

Robert Archambeau thoughtfully interrogates:

> Are we about to see the emergence (not just on the right) of a new
> _plumpes Denken_?
>

Being able to think and represent the present historically (or more
correctly to think and represent the present of capitalism historically)
is the obligate parasite of both the poet and the philosopher, here,
now. It was Brecht who challenged Lukacs' formal 'realism' of class
consciousness in search of that more transparent 'alientation effect'.
And it was indeed Benjamin's _Plumpes Denken_ that marked a desire for a
cunning clarity. But it was also Brecht, the Theater man, the emergent
(silent) Cinema man and Benjamin (brought up rudely, jostled out of the
pose--the hope!--of the flaneur to be only *the man in the crowd*) who
reacted not merely against a hegelian obscruantism but more, more
importantly, against the pellucidus age of electro-mechanical
reproduction, the missing aura mis-taken as frames-per-second or
streaming RealAudio(TM)(sic). A cusp of history off sorts.

And now.
An emergent post-theory *ad interim* or perhaps a representational
*annus magnus*? Hegel is afoot in this
end-of-history-one-superpower-death-of-communism-pax-americana-
northern-hemispheric-impererial-alliance. A clarity of style, perhaps a
pure form, an _Ecstasy of Communication_ (to appropriate Baudrillard)
with trade agreements and trade zones and (pace our Drug Czars)
"sentencing guidelines" and "sentencing contests":
the judges themselves are ham-strung in the alleged post-ideological
verities of law and order and the aristotelian keeping 'in check',
syllogistically, of inflation, during the long duree.

Good question.

 And I try with difficulty to write in the margin of my screen, my
browser-frames, non-rhetorically and throwing no pies: "Since when did
use-value succumb to the totalities of (lets say, post 1989)
exchange-value, transmogrifying 'intentionality', 'sentence', 'qualify',
'merit' and the temporaltity of 'since when' in this sentence?"

Jameson writes of Wydham Lewis' "machine-sentences" quite outside his
'intentionality' (i.e., his fascism) particularly "the Lewis of the
final years, able only to hear his language, reverts to an almost 18th
century sobriety, the fireworks of the earlier style now passing over
into the content of the narratives themselves." _Fables of Aggression:
Wyndam lewis, the Modernist as Fascist_.

And now.
Perhaps _The New Sentence_ is already bar=coded as the neo-retro
sentence. Un-plugged. And *reading-values*  succeed in their
reproduction precisely through the triumph of the medium of exhange by
the triumph of exchange itself. And now. Perhaps a passing over, a
giving up the ghost, the haunting specter, for a twenty-first century
narrative of agonistic sobriety.

Joe Amato's post did not, for me, sound as though he was beating around the
bush. I found it provocative & useful. Given we are in the midst of a
federal election up here, I found the following relevant:

"whether having to be "clear" about such motivations is "where" we are in
critical-theoretical terms, at this moment in academic culture (robert's
question, as i understood him), i'm not sure... my guess is that we might
as academics find some helpful room to move through a more performative
understanding of what we are about... but u.s. culture is predisposed
toward posing [he sez], both in and out of the academy, so i'm not going to
wax entirely optimistic on this count..."

I am disturbed by a party, Reform, which seems to be following the worst of
the republican far right moves. Reform says it wants to create ('create'?
well, it seems to suggest that nothing like exists now, although they are
able to be a party & argue their case) a Canada of 'equal' provinces &
'equal' people. A nice thought. But they will do so by 'downsizing' the
central government, giving much more power to provincial governments. But
can the people trust those governments (any more than that damned federal
government)? A question not asked. What is this equality of people? Well
everyone must be treated the same (although one Reformer spoke last year of
supporting a businessman who would move people of colour or gays into the
backroom so as not to bother customers [& people are not longer citizens in
this vision but mere customers]). Now, the problem, as I see it, is that
the theoretical arguments that would suggest that this equality misses out
a lot of socially structured inequalities that Reform wants to make sure
can & will not be altered by any government mandated structural changes.
And what I want to know (surely this applies down there as well, including
all the talk bout the NEA) is what language, what discourse, might reach
the very people who have the power (or want it) to destroy what positive (&
theoretically valid?) structures now exist. Can anything be accomplished by
a discourse they dismiss as 'unreadable'? More important: is it possible to
'translate' the theoretical ideas into a discourse that will reach a wider,
political audience? I write this as someone who reads & enjoys a lot of
theory, but also, especially, admire the clarity with which Guy Davenport
(for example) writes about extraordinarily 'difficult' poetry.

I'd just like to recommend a truly fine treatment of this conjunction:

Jan Zwicky. _Lyric Philosophy_ (Toronto: Unversity of Toronto Press, 1992).

Of which Guy Davenport says: "Something to read with pleasure and
enlightenment. The interplay of text and quotations is fascinating ... a
substantial book that has the virtues of integrity and domesticity which it
celebrates."

something which relates to this from my own experience. when i was an art student in
graduate school my teachers sd i shld take philosophy. you didn't write in art class you
painted. or you drew pictures. or you made objects and sd it was sculpture. but you
didn't think abt writing. (i have had bad teachers. but i've also had good ones.) so i took
classes in philosophy. on my essays they sd i shld really be thinking abt this stuff in
fine arts, or maybe _literature_. so now i'm in _literature_. once a fellow student sd it
was a good thing i was taking a certain lit. course with a certain instructor because
anyone else wld tell me i cldn't do what i wanted to do. hard to imagine that sort of thing
being thot in 1997. actually it was in 1995 but that doesn't matter. a key word is
_interdisciplinary_. that's a more precise term in this instance i think than, say,
"multi-disciplinary" or "environmental" or even "transdisciplinary." i finally got a degree
in _interidsciplinary_ studies. i like hamlet's response to horatio's question best, when he
asked him what he was reading. "just words."

Douglas Barbour has moved this discussion onto Canadian terrain.  He
has done so, however, in a fashion that I find dangerously misleading.
Since American eyes tend to glaze over at the mere mention of Canadian
affairs, I will do my best to keep my comments brief.

In a fashion that ignores the profound differences between Canadian
and American contexts, Barbour begins by drawing a direct parallel
between Canada's Reform party and "the republican far right":

>I am disturbed by a party, Reform, which seems to be following the worst of
>the republican far right moves.

Barbour then proceeds to zero in on the weakest link in Reform's
arguments: its theoretically impoverished concept of personal and
provincial "equality."  In the process, however, he refuses to face up
to the gross defects in Canada's current system of federal government.


>Reform says it wants to create [...] a Canada of 'equal' provinces &
>'equal' people. A nice thought. But they will do so by 'downsizing' the
>central government, giving much more power to provincial governments.

Barbour conspicuously fails to mentions that, at present, Canada finds
itself saddled with a parliamentary system in which, once a party has
formed a majority government, it is able to rule in a fashion that is
virtually dictatorial.  Under the constraints imposed by the dominant
federal parties, individual members of parliament are unable to modify
their votes in a fashion that reflects either their own views or the
views of their local constituents; any departure from party policy
results in harsh disciplinary action.  What this means is that the
party in power can pass pretty much any legislation that it wishes to
pass, no matter how ill-conceived that legislation may be.

To make matters worse, the electoral map has been drawn up in such a
manner that Canadians living east of the Ontario/Manitoba border play
a grossly disproportionate role in determining precisely who will
control the federal parliament.  As a result, the legislative agenda
of the governing party tends almost inevitably to favour the interests
of Ontario and/or Quebec over the interests of other
provinces--especially those that lie to the west of the
Ontario/Manitoba border.

None of this would matter so much if there existed, in Canada, an
elected senate that was structured in such a way as to provide a
countervailing voice, a voice reflective of the teeming diversity of
regional and provincial interests.  Instead, however, we are stuck
with an appointed senate that bears a closer resemblance to a
geriatric ward than to a meaningful arm of government.

As someone who has recently returned to British Columbia after having
lived for eight years in the United States, I find myself appalled by
the glaringly undemocratic and asymmetrical character of Canadian
federalism.  Much to my chagrin, moreover, I find that the only party
that is seriously interested in correcting this state of affairs is
Reform--a party that, like populist parties elsewhere in the world, is
tinged by disturbing hints of nativism, ethnocentrism, and xenophobia.


Be that as it may, I am quietly hoping that Reform makes a reasonably
strong showing in the coming elections.  After all, under Canada's
current system of parliamentary dictatorship, Reform has no chance
whatsoever of implementing the more pernicious aspects of its
socioeconomic agenda.  Reform does have a chance, however, of
reminding the quasi-colonial powers of Eastern Canada that a growing
number of Canadians are unhappy with the existing system of
asymmetrical federalism, a system that is characterized by arrogant
forms of patronage and influence-peddling.

Let me add that I do not share Douglas Barbour's concern about the
consequences of giving increased power to the provinces.  It seems to
me that progressive movements for social change in fact probably have
a greater chance of succeeding under a more decentralized federal
system than they do under the current federal system.  Sadly, many
Canadian intellectuals have come to imagine that the road to social
justice inevitably leads through Ottawa--just as many American
intellectuals have come to imagine that the road to social justice
inevitably leads through Washington.  All of us need to begin thinking
our way beyond this crude form of bureaucratic centralism.

Although the American situation differs in profound ways from the
Canadian situation, there is good reason to believe that both
countries would benefit from a general devolution of federal powers.
It is crucial, however, that the debate over the form and direction of
such devolution not be abandoned entirely to the right.  Contrary to
what is implied by the ongoing retreat into bland, rear-guard defences
of the welfare state, the contemporary left still has much to learn
from the anti-statist perspectives of its anarcho-syndicalist
heritage.

At the risk of being booed off the stage, I will also suggest that the
contemporary left still has much to learn from the contemporary right.
The trick, in this case, is to subvert and translate our opponent's
ideas in ways that open up possibilities that our opponents have not
anticipated.

I've gone on much longer than I had intended, yet I fear that I still
have not done enough to clarify the points that I have been seeking to
make.  If anyone wishes to press matters further, I will be glad to
follow up with additional comments--including comments that will bring
us back to the issue of federal funding for the arts and humanities.
Otherwise, I will cease and desist.

Poetas,

I attach here a call for applications for research fellowships (for
post-docs and/or grad students) from a certain Center for Judaic
Studies at the Univ. of Pennsylvania.  While one assumes (from the
description) that the fellowships would include, as prereq., language
facility (primarily) in Hebrew, as well as (perhaps) German, Arabic,
and/or Latin -- still & all, I felt the mere description of the scope of
proposed research might, in itself, prove of some passing interest to
our Poetics denizens.  (I, for one, wasn't aware of this stuff.)

FYI--

CENTER FOR JUDAIC STUDIES
University of Pennsylvania
Post-Doctoral (and Advanced Research) Fellowships 1998-99
Application Deadline November 30, 1997

Topic I:
POETRY AND CULTURE IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE JEWRY

The writing of Hebrew poetry was a widespread activity in all
premodern Jewish communities, and was shaped by intellectual currents
and historical forces of all kinds, both internal to the Jewish
community (such as kabbalah) and external to it (such as Islamic or
Renaissance culture). The full interpretation of Hebrew poetry and the
assessment of its place in Jewish intellectual life necessitate
interdisciplinary study, which has never yet been systematically
attempted. This research group will consist of specialists in medieval
and Renaissance Hebrew poetry and specialists in disciplines and
subject matters that found expression in or influenced that poetry.
Such scholarly interplay will aim at a fuller appreciation of the role
of Hebrew poetry in Jewish intellectual life as well as a broader
understanding of the disciplines themselves. The disciplines include,
but are not limited to, history, philosophy, mysticism, medieval
science, Romance literature, and Arabic literature.

Topic II:
HASKALAH,  ENLIGHTENMENT,  AND EUROPEAN SOCIETY

The impact of the Enlightenment on Jewish thought and social life
continues to attract  lively debate among scholars from different
disciplines. Historians, philosophers, and students of literature have
seen the Enlightenment as the source of the 'crisis' in traditional
society, as the harbinger of radical assimilation, or as the
forerunner of such movements as the Wissenschaft des Judentums, Reform
Judaism and even Zionism. The research group will consider such issues
from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective within the
context of Western and Eastern European societies, focusing on the
German Enlightenment. It will examine the impact of Enlightenment
thought on European Jewry, as well as the Jewish contribution to the
European Enlightenment.


Each group will consist of 6-8 Fellows. Outstanding graduate students
in the final stages of writing their dissertations may also apply.
Stipend amounts are based on a Fellow's academic standing and
financial need with a maximum of $30,000 for the academic year. A
contribution may also be made towards travel expenses. Awards will be
announced on January 30, 1998.

Re: th eparagraph below. Because of the general ignorance and lack of
personal and moral integrity of the people who make up such parochial racist
movements it is unlikely that any of their policies will be really
acknowledged outside those that are ethnocentric/racist - & if any influence
is made on the main stream it is likely to be in limiting immigration,
toughening up on recent (less affluent) immigrants & in local justification
of prejudice already facilitated by the current anti-pc backlash - (or
continued lashing). However i am not familiar with Canadian politics & am
merely reflecting on what has been going on around here.

It's unfortunate to have to bring up Mr Hilter all the time, but there
really were aspects of his policies that were beneficial to a 'german'
population & i seem to remember a similar argument in a small tavern in
Dusseldorf back in 1935 with Fritz Eichhornchen - when i distinctly remember
him saying "hoffentlich, wer gesehen  nur die gutes poilizies von Herr
Hilter und die schlechtes wollen allen disapierien sein." I remember
criticising his gramma as well as his politics. But he had been drinking and
was from Barvaria so i didn't make too much of it at the time. How wrong he
was.

Hamlet's response to Horatio points to the dilemma of poets in a world
in which words must be "blooded" with the (fake blood) action of actors
as in Al Pacino's magnificent "Looking for Richard" which I recommend
to anyone interested in tragic poetry & the "impure" effects of language
such as the way Pacino "plays" Richard among his fellow actors even in
the scenes when he is "off-scene" (one-upmanship) & points back
to my harangue about the buffoonery of poets in a narrated world of films
& music where "prestige" (awards, academies, etc.) only serves hilariously
to accentuate their unnecessary presence (they are excellent actors, though,
all of them, from Ashbery to Zukofsky) & points again back to the
necessary TRAGIC NARRATIVE of NECESSITY, SISSIES, SYSIPUSSIES, underlying
the demand for "craft" and "voice" if you want to "publish" in a coherent
"fashion" your incisive "poetics" etc. etc.

Quite right, George B., but of course poets aren't the only ones who
indulge in referring to what other people do as crazy. I do wish I
had these texts at hand so I could bring forth more exactly what I was
referring to in Jameson and Perelman.I'm sure I wasn't being entirely
fair to Perelman, and he certainly was not being as off the cuff as I am
in this context.I promise to do more homework and report back, but as I
remember it many poets I know were astonished some years back when Jameson
wrote about postmodern poetry, citing Perelman's poetry as an example of
deliberate attempts in poetry to imitate "schizophrenic language." In his
recent book discussing so called "language poetry" (a context in which
Perelman's mature work, and maybe even his immature work, as a poet
emerged) he critiques both Andrews and
Bernstein (here's where would be nicer to quote, and unfortunately
I can't at the moment) for being less than coherent, let us say, orderly
and meaningful in ways that might have significant and useful social
value.
In short, he apparently is accusing them of publishing works that have
aspects of being nonsensical! Without intending to be overly flattering,
this is
like DeKooning accusing Pollack of being vague and ambiguous, pot accusing
the kettle, etc. So the
problem, for me, is not so much poets and critics talking diagnostically
like doctors,
but poets posing as doctors and accusing other poets of being suspiciously
disoriented...even, perhaps ,apparently inebriated, at times not
completely serious, or almost
nuts! Heavens forfend! L=A poets
indulging in playfully batty antics!
But I am babbling on...
Best wishes,
Nick P.

Clearly, my first impulse was correct: there is little point in
attempting to explain the complexities of Canadian politics to a
non-Canadian audience.  Nobody outside the country really gives a damn
about our constitutional problems, and nobody outside the country is
interested in taking the time to understand the peculiar nuances of
our interregional and interprovincial conflicts.

And so we find that, before deploying his _ad_Hitlerum_ argument, Mr.
DS blandly, and almost proudly, acknowledges that he knows little and
cares less about Canada:

>[...] i am not familiar with Canadian politics & am
>merely reflecting on what has been going on around here.

Of course, it is true that, despite appearances to the contrary, my
argument bore only a tangential relation to the particulars of
Canadian politics.  I was in fact attempting to make a broader point
about the left's abysmal failure to think beyond the centralist models
of the warfare/welfare state.  Some of us like to talk about radical
democracy, but very few of us seem willing to do anything about it.

In Canada, the Reform party has seized upon the perfectly legitimate
desire for more participatory forms of democratic governance.  By
talking, if only in rather specious ways, about the need to make
politicians more responsive to local and regional interests, the
Reformers have coopted what could--and should--form the basis for a
revivified leftism, a leftism that would be predicated upon the
assumption that concepts of democratic participation should be
extended to all realms of social life, including the workplace (a
realm that Reformers conspicuously exclude from their democratizing
rhetoric).

In British Columbia, at least, many of the people who are now voting
for Reform are people who used to vote for the NDP, which remains the
most identifiably left-wing of the more prominent Canadian political
parties.  In addition, Reform has begun to win significant support
among many of the recent, Asian immigrants to British Columbia.  In
response to these shifts in its base of support, the party has been
either expelling, or consigning to the back room, its old-line,
nativist members.  Needless to say, this hardly means that the party
should now be given a clean bill of health.  But it does make for a
more complicated mixture of interests and alliances than is dreamt of
in Mr. DS's morally pure version of political theology.  (Just in case
anybody out there gives a damn about such details, it should probably
be noted that, in an earlier period of British Columbian history, Ezra
Pound's old favorites, the Social Credit, went through an even more
convoluted series of metamorphoses.)

I realize, of course, that Mr. DS could easily respond with further
Hitlerian analogies.  I refuse, however, to take such a static
approach to our historical situation.  I wrote my previous comments in
the sincere belief that the left needs to pay closer attention to the
radical potentials latent in the pervasive tendency to seek
alternatives to centralist models of government.  By allowing the
discussion of such alternatives to become entirely the province of the
right, we are, I believe, abdicating a crucial responsibility.

I end this message with some sense of regret.  In the last couple of
days, I've finally had a bit of free time.  It had been my intention
to engage, after long silence, with some of the more specifically
literary issues that have been cropping up on the list.  Instead, I
find myself wrestling with that old demon, politics.  I guess, despite
all my attempts at rehabilitation, I really am an incurable political
junkie.  Helas!!

Not having read Jameson's remarks I cannot say what he intended, but it
seems to me that an exploration of the language of schizophrenia would be a
good thing, an important thing, a meaningful thing, and full of useful
social value.

Jakobson was fond of the slogan:

Linguista sum; linguistici nihil a me alienum puto
[I am a linguist; I consider nothing foreign to me that has to do with language]

If you replace "linguista" with "poeta", it works equally well for this
list, no?

Andrew John Miller makes some interesting points about the Canadian
political scene, but 1) I live in Alberta, & I can tell you I don't want
the provincial government there to have any more power than it already has,
&, however badly managed & run the central government may be (& I would
happily support a system in which all parties got some representation based
on voting patterns across the country), it does provide some balance; 2) I
think ds salmon hits the nail on the head, & this can be seen in the fact
that the "Liberal" government has, in fact, already begun to cut & reshape
immigration & law to Reform desires; 3) I really raised the political
question in order to ask about the use of language, the how of getting
theory down to the street, so to speak.

I was only trying to pull some of that discussion into the world of
political doing. Possibly theory just doesnt 'go' there? But, no, the
questions raised about ideology & power are real, & somehow or other it
would be good to bring those questions to bear in the public arena against
the leaders who insist that all we need is 'common sense' (whatever that
is, or they mean by that).

I do think it's worth considering Mr Miller's suggestion "that the
contemporary left still has much to learn from the contemporary right.
The trick, in this case, is to subvert and translate our opponent's
ideas in ways that open up possibilities that our opponents have not
anticipated." But I also worry about the ethics of it all...

andrew john miller, i can't speak for canada, though i have close relatives
in toronto (originally from france, and from quebec), a close friend in
winnipeg, doug in alberta, and friends elsewhere... the politics in canada
have always been a bit fuzzy to me, perhaps b/c i don't live with them,
perhaps b/c i am not as informed as i should be...

but on this side of the border, i do think i grasp what's going on... of
course i can appreciate your appeal (as i understand you) to develop a
leftist grassroots orientation (about which there are some real activists
on this list) that will somehow address the soi-disant centrist-democractic
impulses in d.c. (in my view, our best bet at this time, even if woefully
deficient)... that is, to develop a populist base for leftist politics
equivalent, say, to the christian coalition...

but point in fact:  whenever i hear somebody on this side of the border
talking about a smaller federal government, i begin to fret... clearly the
impulse on the right is to turn over the rei(g)ns to what are only
putatively local interests, b/c in fact it's clear, in so many communities
in this country, who currently has *power* at the local level... this is
what the republicans and ralph reed are banking on (pun intended)... and as
far as they're concerned, with the notable exception (however misinformed)
of somebody like jack kemp, the inner city can go to blazes...

seems to me that you have to evaluate political possibilities in terms of
what is actually going on---which includes the political disparities
already in place (in essence this is an issue of power distribution)... i
would act, i think, in two ways---from the top down, and from the bottom
up... dismantling a central power base, however compromised, w/o that
bottom-up apparatus (sorry!) in place or at least highly visible could be
positively lethal, no?... and as far as the u.s. goes, imnsho, you take
power away from clinton (or equiv. white house rep) at this moment in time,
and  (how shall i say this?) you may as well plan on your kids developing
expert knowledge of the revised standard version and _the wall street
journal_...

i hate to give the impression that i'm operating solely out of fear---but i
just don't see the viability of pulling support away from the dems at this
moment, or away from some central federal power that at least pays
lip-service to leftist agenda (symbolic capital, folks), albeit i'm not
certain that you're suggesting we should... in any case i hope things go
well for you folks with liberal sentiments and commitments on the other
side of the border, where things are not so ostensibly binary...

best,

Henry,

My mistake. I agree with your point, by and large, though I venture to say
it doesn't necessarily cancel my own point, which remains this: while we
originally read critics & philosophers for their gist alone, as it were, we
re-read them - if at all - for the pleasure their writing may afford us. Is
this pleasure necessarily different from the pleasures of the poem?  For
instance, Heidegger's own work on poetry so clearly, it seems to me, begs to
be called poetic (at least by him). I think wherever a certain linguistic
density accrues - whatever its aims and intents might be - that density
announces the appearance, be it ever so nascent, of the"poetic." But you are
quite right to assert that analysis differs entirely from the impulse to
write a poem, which is a synthetic operation. All I'm saying is, language
makes funny things happen. That's what they say in Wyoming anyway, where the
raindrops fall as big as your fist and swarm like the Myrmidons from their
black-hulled ships.

P.S. - what do you mean exactly by Ariosto singing for his supper? How does
that differ from the institutional largesse which so many writers depend on
today - unless you're talking about strictly "spiritual" dividends.

Patrick : interesting, because total, misreading of what I said.  Makes
me wonder about my own ability to express myself.
I don't think all writing aspires to poetry.  I think critical analysis
& philosophy are distinct activities - they are not poetry.  What I was
trying
to say was that in a democratic world the justification of poetry by
means of an academic critique of socio-political structures is the
ultimate circus carnival of a self-promotional hyped-up market empire.

Poetry is something else.  Closer to Ventadour/Blackburn's concept of
the singing heart.  But even CLOSER to something more allegorical &
literary: Ariosto, for example.  Another courtly poet singing for his
meals.

Thus speaking (tangentially) of Blair --

I enjoyed reading James Fenton's article, "The Self-Made Man" in the
current issue (dated June 12, 1997) of the New York Review of Books.
The article is billed on the cover as "At School with Tony Blair" --
so happens, poet Fenton went to school with Blair for a time, and has
some close-range memories & wide-angle reflections to share.

Since I really know/knew nothing about Blair, I found it useful to
get this bit of background.  Also should note that I'm just beginning
to pick up on / tune into the good writing that Fenton has been
regularly doing for the New York Review (since, I guess, a long
while).  For instance -- incidentally -- the just-previous issue has
a good article about Sylvia Plath, written by Fenton

I just co-directed a psychology/English thesis on avant-garde poetry and
the language of schizophrenia.  I can backchannel a bibliography of
materials (mostly from the discipline of psychology, things unread in
lit theory circles) to anyone who has an interest.

As an ex-Manitoban of French ancestry, I suppose I am not disinterested
with regard to all this discussion about Misrepresenting Canada, but I
would like to add my two cents (that's 1.4 cents in US currency) to this
debate, even though this is probably not the right forum for any lengthy
debate of the issues.

I think what is important to recognize is that:

1. The Reform Party has a set of disasterously retrograde, narrow, and
bigoted policies.

2. Reform has gained support because people in the Western Provinces
feel quite rightly that they are not heard in the capital, where those
in power see most conflicts in terms of the balance of power between
Ontario and Quebec (the West tends to get collapsed into "English
Canada" but the interests represented under this rubric tend to be those
of Southern Ontario).  IE: REFORM PRESENTS ILLEGITIMATE SOLUTIONS TO
VERY REAL PROBLEMS.

3. The discontent in the West is by no means new -- the leftist NDP was
once the vehicle of this discontent.

4.  We need people on the left in Canada to find a way to articulate
their views and mobilize Western discontent.  Otherwise we leave the
discontented voters to Reform, who are the only people who even *claim*
to represent the West.  [So why are people like Barbour, whose hearts
are in the right place, so suspicious of such action?]

I took Andrew John Miller's point to be that Reform (while a
reprehensible group) would open the eyes of those in Ottawa to the real
needs of the West.  This would be the best thing that could come of
Reform, but many worse results seem just as likely.

(I took this kind of warning of likely bad results to be D.P. Salmon's
legitimate point, though he stated it in a way that I find extreme and
that will alienate those who might have supported him).

Rather than hoping for some good to come of their reprehensible
policies, ought we not to mobilize a politically acceptable alternative
with which to channel Western discontent?

I am tempted to respond to Douglas Barbour's latest remarks on a
point-by-point basis.  I fear, however, that an excessively specific
discussion of Canadian politics may alienate and/or bewilder the many
non-Canadians on the poetics list (non-Canadians who, for all I know,
have already been thoroughly alienated and/or bewildered by the
relatively little that has already been said on what, by world
standards, is admittedly a somewhat parochial topic).

In an attempt to avoid terminal long-windedness, I shall focus my
remarks on an article that appeared in this morning's (May 26th)
_Vancouver_Sun_: "Rural residents swinging toward Reform and away from
NDP" (available at http://www.vancouversun.com).

At the outset of the article, we are told of a carpenter--currently a
Reform supporter--who "complains that big business runs Canada, that
free trade isn't free and that multinationals rule the world."  A few
paragraphs later, we learn that this individual "used to support the
[left-leaning] NDP because it 'was for your average working person.'"
It seems that he, like many others in his position, no longer finds
that the NDP speaks adequately to his interests.

As the article proceeds, it becomes apparent that those who support
Reform are indeed afflicted by many of the ailments that have
traditionally afflicted the supporters of populist movements:
nativism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-intellectualism.
At the same time, however, it also becomes apparent that support for
Reform is fuelled, above all, by a legitimate and understandable sense
that the Canadian political system is not responsive to the concerns
of the "average working person."

I would suggest that this sense of powerlessness is something that the
left ignores at its own (and ultimately society's) peril.  The left
(or what's left of it) needs to do more than assert its sense of moral
superiority: it needs to speak, in persuasive terms, to those,
throughout the world, who find themselves shell-shocked by the effects
of accelerated globalization.  The left needs to do this, moreover, in
a manner that, on the one hand, addresses the legitimate, populist
desire for more direct forms of democracy, and that, on the other
hand, avoids pandering to the destructive, populist tendency to
stigmatize all of those who are somehow alien or different.

I could say a lot more about these matters.  I believe, however, that
it is high time for me to cease and desist.  Still, I cannot resist
noting that the issues at stake in contemporary Canadian debates have
a much broader range of historical and geopolitical relevance than may
at first be apparent.  I think, for example, of the hostility that
Kenneth Burke encountered when, at the 1933 American Writers'
Congress, he suggested that the left needed to think more
pragmatically and strategically about its strategies of persuasion:
"[O]ne cannot extend the doctrine of revolutionary thought among the
middle class," K. Burke argued at that time, "without using
middle-class values--just as the Church invariably converted pagans by
making the local deities into saints."

I shall close with two, relatively small points.  (Those of you who
have no taste for Canadian affairs can feel free to tune out at this
point.)

First, I want to stress to David Bromige that, in my allusion to
Social Credit, I was not attempting to distort the history of BC's
(now virtually defunct) Social Credit party.  Instead, I was
attempting, in an excessively brief and parenthetical fashion, to
illustrate the manner in which populist impulses are readily
appropriated by those who lack any substantial desire to make
government either more responsive or more participatory. (In the
Canadian context, the best contemporary example of this form of
appropriation is probably the neoconservative authoritarianism of Mike
Harris's Ontario government--a government that came into power
chanting populist mantras and promising a "commonsense revolution" but
that has focused, more than anything else, on limiting the privacy and
autonomy of both individual citizens and local municipalities.)

Second, I would like to respond briefly to Douglas Barbour's claim
that he does not "want the provincial government [in his home province
of Alberta] to have any more power than it already has."  I would
point out, for one thing, that Alberta's current premier, Ralph Klein,
has openly opposed himself to Reform's vision of constitutional
reform; Klein, it seems, has federal aspirations--aspirations that may
eventually land him a powerful role in that top-heavy, central
government to which, it seems, Alberta's marginalized left currently
looks for encouragement and relief.

Finally, I would point out that, in the ongoing dispute over BC's
salmon-fishing industry, the federal government in Ottawa has been
extremely slow to act on behalf of BC's interests.  If Ottawa is now
at last beginning to move in a decisive fashion (by seizing American
fishing boats and by pressing for meaningful negotiations with the
Americans), it is doing so only to the extent that BC's (nominally
left-wing) NDP government has chosen to act as an autonomous and
sovereig power.

When BC's premier, Glen Clark, denied the American navy its
traditional access to the testing grounds at Nanoose Bay, he
overstepped the limits of the federal/provincial division of powers.
In the process, Clark made it clear that, under the current system of
asymmetrical federalism, the only way for western provinces to gain
the attention of the central government is to ignore the legal
niceties and to proceed with a raw assertion of power. I, for one,
would prefer a federal system in which all provinces had adequate
federal representation and, as a result, did not find themselves
compelled to flout the provisions of both Canadian and international
law.

If anyone wants to talk further about Canadian politics, please feel
free to backchannel me.  In any further communications to the list, I
promise to confine myself to matters of a more overtly poetic sort.

Actually i was reflecting on current examples of 'grassroots' political
movements both here in New Zealand and n Australia. Not wanting to burden
the list with yet another regional example i (unsuccessfully - and from the
sounds of it offensively - i apologise) tried to allude to this in passing.
Unfortunately i came across as merely flippant et al. My intended point was
that in the case of these groups - who often do offer certain qualities we
associate with the traditional left - it is their racist, xenophobic
policies that seem to become their rallying point. & I am sorry - this is
unforgiveable to me, regardless of any otherwise-positive social policy. As
for accusations of my ignorance re-Caadian politics, i am guilty, but i must
ask he who points the finger - (& from whom i would welcome comments on our
own political system) just how much he knows about the New Zealand or even
the Australian situation.

wHO? roBERT hUGHES?   really?
The woman is Pauline Hanson (sp?) & it is not just anti-aboriginal, but
perhaps even more so anti immigrant, anti-gay, pro-gun, anti political
dissidents - the whole busload. She was one of the people i was refering to
previously, having set up the Pauline Hanson party. Have heard her
interviewed & was astonished by how un-media savvy & stupid she came across.
Can't say much for her supporters.  Which seems to be becoming popular.

But then wht would i know, I'm a New Zealander (hence the nz on email
adress) & AUstralia is a continent far away from this island.

But I've read that this ineptitude with respect to the media is precisely
one of the reasons why she is so popular. It's Spiro Agnew deja vu all
over again.

Get the media to attack you and that gives you legitimacy in the eyes of
supporters. I'm not sure from what I've read if she is aware of what she
is doing. But you can be sure somebody in a right-wing think tank knows a
good thing when he sees it.

Saw Bobbie Hughes on Charlie Rose the other night. He made a hint that he
was still involved politically in Australia. btw, if Bobbo was a poetry
critic, then all the early poems of a poet would be good and the later
ones would not be anywhere near as good. That's what he had to say about
the works of Warhol, de Kooning, and O'Keefe. He may be right, but it
sounded like this was a critical schtick that he happened upon and
incorporated into his act.

Hello George T,
I fully agree. The study of schizophrenic language, especially with
relation to contemporary poetry, is a rich and valuable area. I'm very
much looking forward to receiving R. Archambeau's bibliography for his
course on avant-garde writing mentioned in another
post. In this regard, I'll mention Harold Searles' valuable
discussions of schizophrenic language-see his Collected Papers.
As I promised in my post on Jameson and Perelman,to be fair to their
work, I will do my
homework, and get back to you and the list, with some brief quotations,
at a later time.
Best wishes,
Nick P.

I would just hope that in 'helping their friends' poets like Bernstein and
Graham et al would occasionally leave the door open for others who they
hadnt taught or had direct connections with, but whose work still strikes
them as interesting. Cronyism not only supports a narrow band of poets but
also narrow bands of poetry.
And remember that in supporting past students and current friends
poets/judges are not being unselfish-- prizes and publications lead to
teaching and editorial positions which then can often come back to benefit
the mentor-poet (as in reading honoraria and publications.)

Back to NEA (threads that wont die), and sillimans great example of how well
he used his grant. While perhaps a majority of the list folk have managed to
find teaching work, many other writers (m'self including) are grunting away
at other jobs andd would relish the ability to buy some freedome (if not
dental work.)
One odd idea-- do blind screening to assure some level of 'quality,' then
pick (37 or however many grants the budget permit) winners at random.
And how about building some need criteria for (at least some of) these grants?

Subject:      Book Contests/AN IDEA

Perhaps like others, no matter
how distinguished the organization
or publisher, I have an
instinctive wariness (weariness?)
about book contests in which
fifteen to twenty-five dollars
are asked to accompany the enclosed
manuscript. It's not that
I necessarily distrust the
need for the money. There
are real labor costs involved
in administering a contest
in which probably an avalanche
of manuscripts must
be processed, promotion
advertisements,  readers and
judges must be paid, etc.
And it's highly unlikely that
the sale of the winner's book
will meet these costs. At best
a book's sales will pay for
printing, a bit of promotion
to announce the winners
and pay a prize amount.

And I'm not disposed to think
that the judges will be dishonest.
At least I don't want to think that
such a contest is just a charade,
or a scrim, behind which a judge, or
judges will pick one winner out
of a preset possible five or six
choices. I suspect Paul Hoover thought
he was entering a crap-shoot in
Georgia, didn't know that Marvin Bell
was to be a judge, and it's gratifying
to realize that Marvin Bell was
"worldly" enough to see the worth
of Hoover's work. At the same time.
I've been around enough to know there
are judges that work on a different set
or lack of principles. That prejudice
or curruption -- depending on the
point of view -- can comes
with any such territory.

What does put me off about such contests,
as such, is that I always sense that
they are not particulary productive
publishing adventures. The winning
books, even with the prize sticker
attached, fall into the same limited
distribution work of any other book.
How many of us, for example, will ever
go into a local bookstore and find
Paul Hoover's book. With luck, Borders
or Barnes & Noble will pick it up and
give it wide distribution. At best, the
winner, and perhaps the press, receives
name recognition. And perhaps there
will be reviews. In the meantime, of
the many of us who spent the $25 (I didn't)
only a small fraction of us --
unless we expend real extra effort -
will never see the book!
On one hand, for those who paid
and submitted their manuscripts,
for many the primary experience
and outcome  of a contest will be
feelings of rejection, anger, money
mispent, and, at most extreme Kent
Johnson style plots de paranoia.
 On the other hand, from the
point of view of the winning poet
and the publisher, there will be
miminal publically critical or appreciative
response from an actual readership
to the actual book -- responses which
could provide a confirmation that
the winning book is well worth the
prize, that the contest was decently
judged etc.

My IDEA is quite simple. I propose that
when publisher's and/organizations
host a book contest - particularly
when there is a submission fee -
that each entrant will recieve a
copy of the winning book. The unit
printing cost of a 72 to 96 page
paperback poetry book probably
varies between $1.50 and $2.50
at the maximum plus another buck
for handling and fourth class postage.
For 3 or 4 dollars of the manuscript
submission fee, the book would
acquire:
1) a real distribution to an audience
of readers who -- in many cases --
would never see it.

2). This critical readership would
potentially affirm or reject the credibility
of the contest. (At least make it clear
whether you want to try the particular
contest again).

3). On a perhaps more profound level,
both poet and publisher would achieve
a much more valuable recognition in
the poetry community for having made
a genuine contribution to "the art" and
and a develpment of a readership for
the work.

Otherwise, unless I've already over-
stressed the point, "the losers" are
most often left blind in the dark,
full of one real or imaginary plaint,
and the winner goes often unread,
not known for the poems, but known
for "winning."

Perhaps publishers -- such as Doug Messerli
at Sun and Moon -- could respond to
this proposal. Essentially
the idea is asking for a change from "submission"
to "reciprocation" between poets (entrants)
and publishers/or organizations.

I think it would be to the profit
of everyone involved.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

I agree wholeheartedly with Stephen's ideas concerning both these types
of contests, and what can be done about it to ensure a feeling of
legitimacy concerning them.  I hope those who are sponsoring such
contests will pay close attention to what Stephen has suggested.

Stephen--as your publisher I think it's a great idea, with one
exception--the economics. It costs Junction Press about $2000 to typeset and
print a run of 1000 copies of a 72 to 96 page book if I typeset and design
myself without remuneration. That would come out to $2.00 per copy if all
copies were for sale. But 1/10 of the run goes to the poet as royalty, and
100 to 150 go as review copies or freebies. That leaves, say, 750 copies.
Perhaps fifty of those will be returned by bookstores damaged beyond
salability. That leaves 700 copies which, at say $10.00 per, could net
between $4,200 and $7,000 if every book were sold. But let's be real--to
sell the entire run can take years if it ever comes to pass. So let's be
optimistic and say that the run nets $3000-5000 dollars, which would be a
profit of $1000-3000, except that other expenses--permissions for cover art,
software, office supplies, storage, advertizing, and I've probably forgotten
a few others--eat a big piece of that pie. What's left, one hopes, may
offset part of the expenses for the next book. But not if a contest has
acquired them for what is essentially fund-raising premiums at $2.00 a copy.
If those who ran contests saw their goal as the support of publishers as
well as writers they would buy the books at 40% bookstore discount.
Of course this would cut into the take for the contest's expenses. But why
not? Shouldn't an institution that touts its image with an eponymous contest
pay something for the advertizing? Should they be exempt from the costs of
the charitable efforts that both unpaid poets and publishers support? Should
they be subsidized by publishers as well as by poets who pay for the
privilege of having their work considered?

For the record, I have never and probably never will submitted work to a
contest that carries a price tag. I think that the practice is insulting,
and the chances for gain are considerably less than say plunking the dough
on double 0 in Vegas.

Who was it suggested the trivium of poetry / philosophy / music? A
beautiful and resonant triangle (which instrument I played in my grammar
school orchestra).

Anyway, for an on-going bibliographic project, could people backchannel
me with information on musical/text collaborations that have resulted in
documented performances, books, scores, etc. Time period:1978-2001. Many
thanks in advance.

Actually, when I sent my "novel," _The Letters of Mina Harker_, to Sun &
Moon, DM informed me that it would have to be entered as part of the
fiction contest, and that I should pay $25 to have it read, something I was
resistant to.  But he added something about how "excellent" my manuscript
was and how there weren't that many entries and that it would be judged by
an outside judge with aesthetics similar to mine.

So, grudgingly, I sent in the money.

Then, a while later, the winner of the "contest" was announced to the
Poetics List--long before I received any notification (tacky?), and it was
given to someone I never heard of--and DM HIMSELF was the judge. I feel
that I should have had my $25 refunded since there was no outside judge and
the "contest" was misrepresented to me.

I'm more than a little uncomfortable with accusations of fraud flying around
on this public a forum. As a publisher I know that the best of intentions
are often thwarted by circumstance, particularly by the pressures of
scheduling, and I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt. This feels
like DM is being publicly challenged to justify his behavior; I'm not sure
how, or if, I'd respond if I were in his place. But given the number of
books he publishes a year this would be a surprising way to pick up small
change.

Be that as it may, it has occured to me that contests can be a dandy way for
a press to raise funds. If only a hundred $25 submissions are received
that's $2500. I could do a perfectly respectable edition of 1000 on lighter
paper than I usually use and with a black and white cover for c. $1500. As
to the labor of reading 100 ms., especially poetry, most submissions fall
into the category of immediate dismissal, after the first half dozen lines,
either because they're ghastly or because they're not to my taste. So a
hundred submissions could probably be narrowed down very very quickly. 200
would take longer, but the swag would certainly be worth the trouble.

Probably most contests are established and run ethically, whatever the use
or merit of contests may be, but I have no doubt that other publishers less
scrupulous than I am have figured out the above mathematics. Caveat emptor.

No public challenge, just an accounting of what happened to *me*.  I don't
think "outside judge" means the press' publisher.  And DM was very specific
to me that he wouldn't be the one deciding.

Contraries. But what can one not imagine, or what imagination cannot
insinuate itself into anyone? [A post facto, redundant point--i.e., like
saying that if you imagined something you imagined it--though it seems
to me that Blake's circumlocution suggests that one may see anything as
an "image of truth."]

talking to find out what you think is not a new idea. they used to call it

also the story that before god created the world he read the torah. this

I keep getting very weirded out by public comments on Perelman's
Marginalization.....At first, I just thought it was a question of my own
reading habits versus those of others...But now I think maybe something
more important is going on...So, for what it's worth:

Many responses to Perelman's book have said essentially the same as above:
that his treatment of Andrews and (esp.'y) Bernstein is harsh, dismissive,
highly unsympathetic.  I don't get it.  Personally I find this reading of
the tone and substance of the passages in question mind-boggling...They
are not that negative, to put it mildly..Since most of the principles in
this case are hanging around the List, there's plenty of room for further
input, from people much closer to this issue than me.  I'll just point out
what has come to really disturb me about this (so that I finally felt like
putting in my $.02):  I wonder whether reviewing and critical habits among
many of us, have skewed our ability to read tone and intention in some
poetry criticism.  Most of us most of the time, concentrate on publishing
or posting responses to poetry we **like** and want to support....There is
an ethos of positive response, you could almost say (my background
showing) solidarity, nonsectarian and generous, toward those poets we
feel affinities with..This is very much the way it ought to be, not least
because resources are scarce, and the path usually pretty tough for most
poets trying to find enough support to just keep on...But have we blunted
our tolerance for careful and specific criticism??? I find the treatment
of Andrews and CB fair and sympathetic and very subtle, and not primarily
dismissive or condemnatory of their poetry..Quite the contrary; but it
certainly is about identifying tensions and contradictions in their work.
I make public comments in print and in cyberspace about other poets, and
start to feel a little anxious, if there is such a widespread perception
that modulated discussions like BP's are attacks, just because they aren't
entirely laudatory...

i don't understand the project. how are these distinctions made?
(poetry/philosophy/music/documented/performance/score/collaboration..(book
i can just about cope with.)) (and to what purpose? (i thought this was
why we paid the police.)) this i think is a sympathetic inquiry.

Blake's
~~Everything that can be imagined is an image of the truth

can be read, first as:
~~Everything that can be imagined is an image

with "image of the truth" being Blake's slant on the nature of
"image" per se.  (I.e., he suggests, IF it's an image, THEN it's an
image of the truth.  Further, IF it can be imagined, THEN it's an
image.  Ergo -- the succinct sentence.)

Wittgenstein's
~~What cannot be imagined cannot even be talked about

can be read as a statement regarding the relationship between word
and image.  (I.e., the priority of image -- or the imaginable -- to
word -- or the discussable.)

These might be construed as contraries, but I'd say they seem more
like mappings along a continuum -- from word to imagination (W.) and
then from imagination to image ["of the truth"] (B.)

Of the two, Blake's invocation of "truth" may strike us, these days,
as the more markedly problematical of the twain.

I know I'm starting to sound like Allan Bloom on this list - kind of
ridiculous.  What I'm getting at is that the survival instinct that used
to "salt" the work of the poet in olden days now goes into film & popular
music.  Poetry is a socio-verbal recovery & counseling retreat center
in our culture, petted & patronized & very "special".  Yeccchhh...
But again we're talking about the social face of it (as with the awards
biz) - not the "inside". And only one aspect of the social face, at that.

P.S. - what do you mean exactly by Ariosto singing for his supper? How does
that differ from the institutional largesse which so many writers depend on
today - unless you're talking about strictly "spiritual" dividends.

Mark P. I wonder how carefully you read what I wrote. I certainly didn't
accuse Perelman of being condemnatory or any such thing. I'm afraid you
found nothing subtle in my remarks- perhaps this is my fault- but you
seem to take me dead seriously- in spite of my frequent caveats about
not having the texts in front of me. My- now seemingly trivial point-
was simply that Perelman seems to miss their "chops" - a word defined in
a posting on here some time ago. What I found strange about Perelman's
critique,
again, had more to do with what it would sound like if Ornette Coleman
commented on John Coltrane for being dissonant. Again, please let me
come back with specific quotes.  Maybe I'm completely off here. You have
challenged me to clarify and defend my off the cuff remarks.By the
way, if you think it is so useful to be confrontative, why are you so
"wierded out" by my rather gentle critique of Perelman? After all, I do
imply he's a pretty good poet by comparing him with DeKooning.

I think Robert Archambeau hits a lot of nails right on their heads. We
probably should get back to poetry (but politics is always there/in), &
backchannel more on this rotten state topic (except that I read everything
in the digest & enjoy the range). Andrew John Miller's latest post does
make some necessary points; but:

Yeah Reform has somehow taken the lead in representing western alienation,
& done so by misrepresenting the politics of (dis) connection. It may do
some good (it will elect quite a few people) waking Ottawa up to the fact
that, as it has said, "The West wants in!" (but too many people arent
seeing that they also want to destroy that which we apparently want in on).
I still fear what they would do with power. The leader is a dogmatist (&
the message, finally, is exclusive not inclusive [& Joe was dead on about
all that]) & I always come back to bpNichol's palindrome on that -- "dogma
I am god".

I hope for a wider range of representation than we now have, but I aint
holding my breath...

I sent a poetry ms. to this contest also. But -- at least in my
understanding -- the entry fee doesn't go to the publisher as such, but to
the Center for Contemporary Arts (?) in L.A.  I guess I rationalize the
high entry fee by assuming that at least part of it is helping a nonprofit
arts organization that does all kinds of interesting, artsy things for the
local community. (Uh-oh, I might be on the verge of suggesting that a
percentage of contest fees go toward subsidizing the NEA, which could turn
around and put some of the money into subsidizing presses, who could then
sponsor more contests -- but no,  it's just a case of attempted thread
fusion.)  Is my assumption here correct? Anyone know?

In what way Mark Baker is Federal Jameson
supposed to be like Coleridge? C. obfuscates
fudges diverges circumambulates etc _not_
in the service of a banal misunderstanding
as it usually sounds to me Jameson does
but rather avoids ever onward the lime
tree bower his prison? Key is I think
to sympathize. Jameson don't. Nor do Spivak.
Ergo resentment and outsider therapy
the which cures nothing for confirmed cases
but there we are hopping among the hybrid

a confederate. Is it true the Ear's over?

I think the question you should be asking here, Fred, is--what is the
relationship between the Center for Contemporary Arts and DM and S&M.  From
what I've heard, the answer would surprise you.

Aren't they more or less the same thing?  CCA and S&M I mean, not Doug

Wittgenstein and Blake seemed related by contradiction. A relation that
Blake would have understood, as he was always uniting contraries.
Wittgenstein does seem rather a Urizenic figure in  his relentless logic -
possibly a redeemed Urizen who has picked up his compass and walked away -

Puts me in mind of Jameson's sense of a contradiction as "a matter of
partialities and aspects; only some of it is incompatible with the
accompanying proposition; indeed, it may have more to do with forces, or
the state of things, than with words or logical implications." (I love his
sentences.) (That was from The Seeds of Time)

 Marjorie Perloff quoting Witt: "...to imagine a language means to imagine
a form of life." (Philosophical Investigations) This seems not incompatible
with the worlds Blake creates in the prophecies where imagining and being
and the language of the poem are simultaneous -

I must admit I was startled to see these two writers on the same line as I
have just finished a book called The Case and have just published one
called Symmetry and have been reading Blake and Wittgenstein in relation to
these two projects (with a lot of Duchamp thrown in) -

I'd like to go back to Valery's distinction between prose discourse and
poetry (I'd like to, but I don't have it very secure in memory or in front
of me on the page...).  Prose does its job when the meaning is delivered;
the language is functional.  Poetry exhibits a pendulum effect - the mind
absorbs the conceptual elements but swings back to the "unforgettable"
surplus whole which is the poem itself.  Seems to me he's onto something
there.  Sure we can talk about a philosopher or critic's style; style is
like clothing - it's on the exact borderline between irrelevant and
necessary for life; poetry, on the other hand, is a form of streaking.
How's that for non-stylish discourse? - Henry Gould

morte difficult than pound and wyatt, less so than learning latin or
japanese. But maybe even the comparison with the latter makes the point: a
sympathetic and educated reader shouldn't have to translate from his own
language unless there's a damn good reason--a hard case to make for anyone's
first sentence in any book. To the degree that the first sentence is opaque
the writer must be limiting his audience to those who have learned his code
from previous books. That can make for a cozy club, but why shouldn't a
newcomer, rather than paying the entry fee, go somewhere else for his amusement?

Please elaborate: I would like to hear how Duchamp fits in.

Regarding the Jameson you introduce: that is a great quote, and a beautiful
sentence. Bakhtin replaces dialectic with dialogic, because there is no
solution between such forces; as in dialog there is no guarantee they
listen to or hear each other.

When I started this thread,
I had no intention of seeing

attack etc. on Doug Messerli

was to focus on making a
more reciprocal relationship
between publishers (particularly
ones that mount contests)
and the poets who pay entrance
fees. My proposal was that
a submission fees would entitle
would also entitle all entering
poets (or writers) to a copy
of the winning book. If that
were the case, for example,
Dodie would have gotten a copy of
the winning title in the S&M
contest and she and other entrants
would be given (if they can overcome
the experience of rejection) an
opportunity to objectively
read the winner's actual work.
Additionally the receipt of a
book becomes a form of reciprocation
for the submission fee.
Not only do I think this process
-- which provides the poet or
writer to judge the material
and see what he or she was
"up against -- but, from a
publisher's point of view,
I think it will expand the
credibility of the process,
possibly increase the print run
(and lower unit costs), but
also get the winner's work
(especially if he or she is
a new kid on the block)
out into a much greater
public ciruclation than this

will provide.

I've never been published by

of respect for the books and
contributions that Sun and Moon
have made to honor the act
of making new and innovative
work. Given the
enormous ambitions of the
Press, and just
the sheer bravado it takes to
survive as a publsiher of
any kind of new writing, I'm sure
Doug has occasionally bitten
off more than he can chew, as well
as had chance to fall err or
victim to mistakes in judgement
or enthusiams. I would first give

Valery (what little I recall clearly as well) was no doubt up to smart
things, but what's wrong with "Poetry does its job when the meaning is
delivered;
the language is functional." In prose and poetry the functional parts of
the language are many and complex: great & local context, etimology, spoken
and thought sound, etc. But I don't like how poetry should be said to
operate differently from prose--only that it often does-and perhaps this is
(only?) because we often read it with different expectations. I can't think
of how 'style' does not attach itself to every word, every utterance--when
the signification is uncertain (as always), then the meaning is the style
(as perhaps someone said already...) what Wittyguystein calls the "halo" of
the word, what Bakhtin calls "heteroglossia" or "ideological meaning." I
guess I think I'm saying I think style is necessary, never irrelevant to
poetry or prose.
        As for the "unforgettable", that surplus: where does it reside? It can't
have to do with length (when you say the whole) because short prose and
long poems, but with the idea of what poetry is. What about Rimbaud's
prose-poems? Or then, what about Hass's?
        As for streaking: what is the emporer doing in his new clothes?

It is possible that, as you say, or as Baktin says, there may be no
solution or resolution. The lack of resolution, as in the undoneness of the
Zoas, has always attracted me to Blake. The resistance of these figure to
each other may be absolute.

Duchamp functions as something like a middle term for me between
Wittgenstein and Blake. Witt's "everyday life being a puzzle of language"
may be a term that could apply to any writer's project. But that sense
added to the the sublime allegory of Blake or Duchamp - in both cases some
sort of allegory of the garden or city or construction of the imagination.
Witt's allegory, in these terms, is grammar and the iron book of this
grammar is something that one can perceive Blake's entities stomping around
in.

Duchamp works in because of his emphasis on language and games (puns,
chess, masquerade etc) as well as on mathematics and logic - These seem
Wittgensteinian - And the sense of the feminine emanation or threatening
and threatened "sexual machine" (in the Zoas and Jerusalem) are in both
Blake and Duchamp. There is a sexual ambiguity to Witt and Duchamp. There
is a linear, literary, sculptural aspect to the art of Blake and Duchamp.

        A "sympathetic" reader might not mind "translating", though I meant to
suggest with that comparison, not that Jameson needed translating, but that
we do all kinds of difficult things--what if it takes a couple years to
"learn" how to read Jameson's prose? Why does his prose have to be
"accessible" so quickly?

To the degree that the first sentence is opaque
>the writer must be limiting his audience to those who have learned his code
>from previous books.

        Or to new-comers who are intrigued, or impressed by the complexity of the
sentence, or who understand it off the bat from reading other long and
complicated sentences, or because they are so familiar with the content.
The audience is limited, after all, once anything is written or said.

That can make for a cozy club, but why shouldn't a
>newcomer, rather than paying the entry fee, go somewhere else for his

        Well, but why not? I think there are two different things going on. The
complexity of Jameson's prose, and the hegemony that might or might not
exist saying that this prose is "necessary" (for something), and _must_ be
mastered despite the difficulty that that entails.

        Or the other answer would be: Jameson's prose is not here for
entertainment ("cozy club") purposes (though puzzling through the long
sentences is not nec. not entertaining), but to instruct; and one part of
the instruction is to keep always in mind while reading it that language is
most 'dangerous' (to something) when it is least visible. Jameson is
working hard to avoid transparency in his prose.

Duemer, interjecting: I originally put Blake and Witt. together because
they are both *interested* in the limits of language, with what in fact
can be said, and what, famously, "we must pass over in silence." On a
larger scale, I've been thinking through as best I can relationships
between Romanticism, especially Brit., and the various things that get
called postmodernism, with the sneaking suspicion that some of the same
psychic sources are responsible. Which is fine by me. Blake, for all his
proclaiming style, is at heart an aphorist, and so is Wittgenstein &
there is something in the "propositional" style that unites them, though
they would, could they meet, be invisible to one another. Wittgenstein
says somewhere in the _Tractatus_ "The sense of the would lies outside
the world," and that anti-essentialism shows up, I think, in Blake's
anti-christian mythology, which as Laura rightly says, remains radically
open. So: I see Blake and Witt. playing parallel games. Or the same game
in separate dimensions.

Yes, very sadly true that the Ear Series, sponsored by the Segue
Foundation, has ended its run of 18 years. The series is slated to
continue, from what I hear, at the Here Cafe on Spring Street and 6th
Avenue probably in October.Over the years, attendees have more and more
complained about the acoustics, in every sense of that word. The series
was invited in partly to pick up the bar and restaurant business on slow
Saturday afternoons. What grew into a very workable symbiosis for many
years,finally faded in its effectiveness when due to inceasing success
of the restaurant and bar biz, the acoustic, attentional situation has
become unworkable for vitually every poet who reads there.
I can vouch for the fact that no stone was left unturned in trying to
work things out with the Ear management, discussions that went on for
many years. The finale included Leslie Scalapino and Steve Benson
reading with sax sideman David Barrett, in a touching and thought
provoking, personal yet linguistic and lyrical long wailin' improv which
for me was a cosmic journey through an endless procession of Ear Inn
mailers from Segue under magnets on the fridge starting in 1979 and
continuing until Saturday, May 24, 1997.

A confederate, yes Jordan--no sound's dissonant which
tells, in this our list-tree bower.  I did too much
for J, and too little for STC, putting one in place
of the other.  Gratuitous, like doing in an albatross.
And an agony constraineth me to travel from post to
post 'til you clear up my possibly banal
misunderstanding of who's got the resentment and
what the confirmed cases (J's readers?) reject cures for.

Sorry that I neglected to note in my previous post about the Ear Inn that it is
located in Manhattan (New York, N.Y.) at 326 Spring Street. The Here
Cafe,is located at Spring and Avenue of the Americas (6th Avenue).

i'm uncertain of the terrain being staked here: where the poetry/prose
distinctions come from in valery, poetry "doing its job" vis-a-vis prose,
the locus of a "surplus," etc:

        a poem is a discourse that demands and induces a continuous
        connection between the voice that is and the voice that is coming
        and must come.  and this voice must be such as to command a
        hearing, and call forth an emotional state of which the text is
        the sole verbal expression.  take away the voice -- the right
        voice -- and the whole thing becomes arbitrary. (opening lecture
        of the course in poetics, 1937)

tho as to style, i don't think valery wants to link it to meaning: thought
has no style, or as he says further:

        what makes the style is not merely the mind applied to a
        particular action; it is the whole of a living system expended,
        imprinted, and made recognizable in expressions.  it is compounded
        of consciousness and unconsciousness, of spontaneity and effort;
        and sometimes calcualtion enters in. ("style," 1945)

not sure where to go hence...

Nick, everything you say is fair...Now I really didn't mean to be very
attacking, using the term weirded out and all..But I accept all that you
say below as pretty reasonable and fair; it seems to me (and it's far from
the first time, for me!) that we've each slightly misheard the other's
intended tone (..in both cases, taking it to be harsher than intended).
To be quite frank, I was using you a little bit as a straw man (...straw
poet? straw critic?..)--I was using the occasion of your post to respond
to a general trend I thought I detected in  several responses to
Marginalization, which I've seen in print as well as in cyberspace.
So...I still feel I've detected a trend which is really there, and that my
comments may be apposite, in a general way...But I acknowledge that your
point was more nuanced than I realized..And as a musician manque (a jazz
bassist, in fact--Henry G!) who has always been maybe excessively
responsive to aural swing, I'm ready to go along with your point about
chops, very whole-heartedly..(whole-ear'd'ly)..

regards, Mark

Fair use of form, Mark, and so please stay me a moment
more from the stone church (mistaking agony for indifference
Poe reviews himself). I had meant that species of thought
poetry paranoia, a social block. Readers who feel it often
write, opening new interiors occasionally, often though
throwing only pies. J's book on Shklovsky's not so bad, eh?
Is the blanket warm? Might as well ask anyone their motives
in gossiping -- loshar haron. In brief, an essay called
Stamina Linguist, a sympathetic appraisal appeared in Poetry
Flap. In it Time Clock wrote excitedly of the possibilities
of equalizing the mix so the lead singer's quieter. Everybody
dreamed. Not far later Federal J evaluated Anonymous (or
The Pearl Poet). Grunge sprung up from R.E.M. and the Pixies
of which everybody spoke reverently (though only certain albums).
For a while there was only grunge. The web is like four now.
The earth cooled. Suddenly there were thousands of tiny writers
crawling over the surface of the earth, and among them, glowing
readers. Thank you, readers.

I think Valery's exact equation  (in "Poetry & Abstract Thought") was:

Prose : Walking : : Poetry : Dancing (or Streaking)

But surely the prose he has in mind here is the prose of the daily paper, a
technical manual, the racing form, or what have you. Not the prose of
Melville or Sir Thomas Browne which we can and do re-read. We don't re-read
our favorite novels simply to relish the hazards of a foregone plot, do we?
Though that does play a role, to be sure (esp. the older one gets...).
Dickens' first descriptions of Pip entering Miss Haversham's room will
always stay with me and has, thus far, always been a pleasure to revisit as
a kind of prose-poem of childhood terror. The meaning, or rather, the
emotion of the scene, certainly can't be leeched away from a single reading.

I'd like to go back to Valery's distinction between prose discourse and
poetry (I'd like to, but I don't have it very secure in memory or in front
of me on the page...).  Prose does its job when the meaning is delivered;
the language is functional.  Poetry exhibits a pendulum effect - the mind
absorbs the conceptual elements but swings back to the "unforgettable"
surplus whole which is the poem itself.  Seems to me he's onto something
there.  Sure we can talk about a philosopher or critic's style; style is
like clothing - it's on the exact borderline between irrelevant and
necessary for life; poetry, on the other hand, is a form of streaking.
How's that for non-stylish discourse? - Henry Gould

I'm all for the virtues of clarity, but I'm not sure I agree with this,
Mark. It's always seemed to me that original or powerful or compelling
writers force the reader to expand by learning how to read their work --
which often appears difficult at first, and perhaps is out of the need to
break from what has proceeded it -- and that this, in part, constitutes what
we mean by reading. Which is not to justify obscurantism or defend
prolixity.

morte difficult than pound and wyatt, less so than learning latin or
japanese. But maybe even the comparison with the latter makes the point: a
sympathetic and educated reader shouldn't have to translate from his own
language unless there's a damn good reason--a hard case to make for anyone's
first sentence in any book. To the degree that the first sentence is opaque
the writer must be limiting his audience to those who have learned his code
from previous books. That can make for a cozy club, but why shouldn't a
newcomer, rather than paying the entry fee, go somewhere else for his
amusement?

Oh dear oh dear. Don't mean to be coming at you with hammer and tongs old
fellow. More a case of your ruminations setting off ones of my own, not so
much responses as tangential flights. I vaguely recall the pendulum effect -
will have to dig up the info at home later. ANYHOW - I quite see YOUR
distinction and am happy to say YES that seems about right. All of this
reminds me of what Jung said about science and religiion - namely, that they
are each in pursuit of the same thing - just different methods. To me, all
philosophy begins with an intuition. It then proceeds to justify that
intuition by analytical means. Whereas poesy ain't got no truck with those
means - don't need it, never did.

Thanks, Mark, for your thoughtful response to my last "Pie Barrage."
Charles Bernstein mentioned to me regarding the issue of tone on the
poetics list that "there have been
studies" which demonstrate that there is an overall tendency to read
posts on lists such as ours as more harsh than intended.
I did see a review of Bob Perelman's "The Marginalization of Poetry:
Language Writing and Literary History" (Princeton University
Press,$15.95) in Witz, Spring 1997,by Susan M. Schultz.This review, for
me, does not at all put out a harsh tone, but it does take issue with
Perelman's treatment of Bernstein's work, with many quotes. She makes a
case for Perelman's setting up Bernstein and Silliman as antagonists
noting "If Bernstein, then, is the primary contemporary fall guy, straw
man, utopian paradoxicalist, Ron Silliman is the poet hero of Perelman's
book...Perelman makes the point even more ascerbically when he maintains
that Silliman does not 'attempt to highlight the pathos (and humor) of a
separation of art from life,or poetry from philosophy,' which seems to me
to be a direct dig at Bernstein's manic wit, though Perelman does prefer
Bernstein's more recent work because he thinks that Bernstein is now
committing himself more clearly to 'a poetics.'"
The review concludes, however, with the statement "But whether or not one
agrees with Perelman's specific arguments, the book marks an important
moment in the literary history of contemporary poetry. it should open
up much needed discussions between language writers about issues that
are too often taken for granted-issues like how to build and extend
community, and how to think about the relationship between poetic form
and actual-not just theoretical-politics. Perelman will make some
members of his audience angry, but that is a good thing, as any
contentious academic will let you know."

Well, Dodie wants her money back. She sees plots. All I know is that we're
better off with Sun & Moon Press and Douglas Messerli than without him.
There were some really exciting ventures before it, mostly 'zines, but you
have to put a perfect binding on the book to get people to buy it. That
costs, and Dodie knows it. She works for a distributor (SPD). There were
ventures... Grossinger published some good early work, and so did Quasha,
but you should have seen some of the other books that were coming out,
glue disintegrating on the shelf, rusty staples. It's good to have a nice
cover and I think it's necessary to connect the present to the past.
People who go there to find Djuna Barnes might discover Ron Silliman for
the first time. Dodie, perhaps you can think of your $25 as upkeep for
Djuna Barnes. I think the contest is a *good* way to make it work. Perhaps
Messerli wasn't happy with the person he got to read the manuscripts. It's
too bad there are ruffled feathers, but I still think the contest is a
great idea.

This is false.  I do not work for SPD.

This is so bogus, it's amazing.  To advertise something one way, to urge
somebody to send you money under one pretext and then to not follow through
with what you announced--with no explanation given--this is a total lack of
accountability, Djuna Barnes or no Djuna Barnes.

aw shucks folks, and with due regard for everybody around here:  if we can
slam-dunk the awp-jorie graham situation, some of us anyway, i don't see
why we should be any less tough on sun & moon... i too have a number of s &
m editions lining my shelves (for which i am grateful), but when it comes
to plunking down 25 bucks for a contest, i like to think that it's not an
inside-job... now dodie didn't say that it was, and in fact i didn't hear
'sour grapes' in what she posted... though she did suggest that the contest
was not handled as up-front as it might have been...

i can already hear some folks saying, 'but you get what you pays for'---you
come at poetry this way, it's already a compromise... still, none of this
has to be reduced to name-calling, or rumor-mongering, or whatever... and
it doesn't really matter how the thread began... we come to these spaces
for all sortsa reasons, and airing difficulties wrt a poetry contest is, in
my view, fair game... the point is that these spaces *can* open up helpful
modulations of public to private, and this includes public contests, and
personal experiences of same... (i might digress here wrt how such spaces
can be used to inflect confidentiality in academe, which latter is supposed
to "protect" people, yet in many cases does just the opposite---but not to
worry, i won't!...)...

you may recall, some of you, it was douglas messerli himself who, last year
sometime, here on poetix, dismissed the choice of the nobel committee for
the laureate in poetry... ok, so now it's his turn, not to defend his
choice perhaps, but perhaps to make the s & m contest rules a bit
clearer... and mebbe someday -- though i hope not! -- it'll be *my* turn...

nothing holier-than-thou implied or intended, but what's good for the goose
is good for the gander, no?...

best,

for those so inclined, who care to pursue this matter of how these lists
tend to work, here's an academic article/journal that i'd highly recommend:
the journal _computers and composition_, vol. 13, no. 3 (1996), has an
outstanding piece on the online list techwr-l, a tech writing list that
serves both academics who teach tech writing and professional writers...
the essay details how, over time, the discussion on that list was
curtailed---very perceptive as to rhetorical effects and such like...
entitled "policing ourselves:  defining the boundaries of appropriate
discussion in online forums," by  johndan johnson-eilola and stuart a.
selber...

Thanx for the thoughtful reply...At this point we (you, I and Susan, in
fact) may just have to agree to disagree.  Susan's review was excellent, I
thought, but I do indeed consider that review to be one of the treatments
of BP I was responding to...That is to say, I definitely don't read
Perelman's nuanced discussion of CB as being as critical as I hear her
saying. Yes, there are quotations..We obviously disagree somewhat about
just what those passages are saying (or implying..)..

regards,
Mark

I've been thinking about this quote from Blake recently as well, and I
think that both quotes from Blake and Wittgenstein involve a relationship
with Being.

I read Blake as demanding an ontological "reality" for the objects of
imagination, ie images, ie poetry.  Things that can be imagined are real in
their own right (which is what I think he means by "truth," that they are
themselves. . .).  He is battling the distinction between science (truth)
and poetry (fiction, imagination).

Wittgenstein, on the other hand, sees language and thought (inseperable for
him) as the limit of Being.  This seems to reduce the world to a totality
of already existing, in his terms, language games, but I think it has the
opposite effect.  Such as statement leaves room for an Other which is, in
Emmanuel Levinas's words, "beyond being."  But as Dan Zimmerman suggested,
the Other, the unimaginable, insinuates (great word) itself into Being, the
realm of language.  This is what Derrida and Levinas call the trace.

Too much "philosophy" I think, but there are important coincidences in Joe
Duemer's post which are important to considerations of poetics and their
impact.

Nick, Mark, re tone.  I hope that Nick is right that my tone in the Perelman
review was not harsh; I think it important to distinguish between critical
and harsh tones.  Criticism respects the text, whereas harshness tends to go
after the author.  Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that all the ideas
discussed in Perelman's book and my review have names and personalities (that

For the record, I like some of Sun&Moon's, Station Hill's and North
Atlantic's books, but I think they'd be embarrassed to be credited with
inventing the wheel. While there will always be a lot of fugitive presses
with shoddy production values, for at least the last 25 years most presses
that survive for more than two or three books print and bind professionally.
Check out the annual poetry book show at New York's Poetry Center (or its
permanent collection) to see what the production norms are.
Or is this a matter of "the world began approximately when I was born"?

Subject:      Why Contests?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Given the unsavory experiences lately described here, several folks have
questioned why anyone would send mss. to poetry contests at all. Well, for
those of us not connected personally with editors, publishers, etc., it's
just about the only avenue open for book publication.  It's a natural
desire for anyone who indulges in creative work to have others experience
it, and in the literary world the primary means of presentation and
distribution of a body of work-- aside from readings, which however
gratifying are local and transitory -- is through a book, and given the
realities of how acknowledgement and recognition (not to mention simple
respect) is bestowed, preferably a book that isn't self-published (though
we all know the rare, famous exceptions to this).  And though the Web
environment may eventually change this situation, right now it's still
mostly self-publishing.

When I plunk down $$ for reading fees and send my manilla envelopes out to
PO boxes already crammed with about 50 other mss. received on any given
day, I know it's a crapshoot.  So what if a majority of individual pieces
have already appeared in magazines?  So have everyone else's.  Most presses
-- like Sun & Moon -- just don't read unsolicited mss. anymore, unless
they're received as contest entries.  The alternatives are (1) send a query
with samples -- in my experience this is just begging for a form letter
describing the press's insurmountable backlog and prior commitments, or (2)
wait till a poem in a magazine catches a publisher's eye, and you're asked
to submit a ms. -- also know as the "when hell freezes over" option.  No,
as infuriating and potentially unfair as contests can be, like LOTTO, they
hold out some slim hope for the rest of us.

Grant Jenkins --

enjoyed your reading (translation, almost) of those two succinct
sentences (B & W's) & their respective intentions.

Naturally, terminology at this level is spun out & used variously -- i.e.,
"Being" (or "truth" -- or even, to a lesser degree, "imagination") are given
particular spin by the particular spinner.  Thus (for instance), to construe
"Being" as including only that which can be included within language,
seems interesting though not without some problems.

Imagination as a faculty that "processes material" that's felt to "well up"
from subconscious regions of the psyche, is another (related) theme here.

Or the White Rabbit books from the 60s, those are quite handsome.  I have
those in mind since SPT's selling Spicer's _Language_.  And, Mark, as it's
been noted before and I'm sure you'll agree, a number of publications with
shoddy production values have been very important--mimeographed, xeroxed,
etc.  In keeping with the Spicer theme, _Open Space_, for example.

Agreed, Dodie, & how vital they were in the 50s and 60s, those poorly
mimeographed stonedly stapled non-acid-free paper zines! Not to take
anything away from the high standards of Sun & Moon or Black Sparrow. But
those raggedy mags were the best some of us deftness-challenged
author/editors cd manage, by way of getting the word out. (And half the
time the word didnt get out : distribution was dicey. Collating & stapling
left some, too wiped out to mail out the library copies when the orders
came in.) I have a bunch here, & when I pick up Wild Dog or The End or Tish
I feel again the thrill of the authentic, which felt authentic, back
then."Trace of/ something" as Creeley has it in a poem. Even today, Mirage,
though a cleaner product than those I'm being maudlin over, has something
of that old immediacy, esp. when handed to one at a reading, like the
evening newspaper.

I guess the sheer volume of sloppiness as the 60s became the 70s phased-out
the aura of these olden goldies until what we needed were the production
values of Boxcar, Temblor, Avec, or Conjunctions, to name just 4 to
indicate far more. Something to say "I really mean this" because the
quick-draw of those 60s classics started to look hamfistedly insincere. Or
only sincere. An d of course, copy machines were taking over from mimeos.
And University Departments were policing the use of their copy machines AND
mimeos, more closely as budgets got cut. (The first thing Pat Nolan said to
me when we were introduced to one another on the SSU campus: "Can you let
me use the Dept mimeograph machine?" It must have been the good old days
still, because evidence suggests that i could. Mind you, he had to enroll &
study real hard in return.)  David.

Right, it's a difficult situation, but I can tell you that one of Junction's
authors came to my attention for the first time when I heard him read and
several of the others had become friends or acquaintances before the press
existed because I liked their poetry, which I had first learned about at
readings. Other books have come by way of recommendations. It's not quite as
bad as getting an audience with the pope--the networks of most poetry
publishers are informal and easily penetrated.
How to put it? Contests that offer a big potential payback (major prize or
major press publication) may be worth the outlay.

Right you are--and a whole lot of smaller Duncan titles, and what is
arguably Wieners' best poem, "We Were There," in its first and I think best
version, produced by I forget who on stapled construction paper, heaven help
us. Also "Asylum Poems." The list could go on for pages. But the general
level of production quality has been amazingly high for a long time.

Fred --

<< It's a natural desire for anyone who indulges in creative work to have
others experience it, and in the literary world the primary means of
presentation and distribution of a body of work. . . is through a book. . ."

Last night I spent a while polishing out a (more anecdotal) response, the
gist being along kindred lines to those you've sketched.  As I finished the
screed, a computer crash zapped it to the oblivion whence it had just
arisen.  Talk about nonbeing.  [if that's possible, Mr. W.]

Back when (not long ago) I mailed MSS to the Yale Series of Younger
Poets (being then pre-40, I'd've been so construed by Yale's rules), I
knew of these poets who'd (as jargon wd have it) "launched careers" via
that same charmed portal:  W.S. Merwin, John Ashbery, Robert Hass,
Carolyn Forche -- estimable enough company (I felt).

Having spent some years in the 80s "building a resume" as arts-journalist
(w/ modest results), and having been hit hard[er] by the poetry bug into
the early 90s, I was rather loathe to paper my walls w/ rejection slips
from periodicals.  Instead, I mainly tinkered out MSS, -- and I dare say
that fanciful notion of publication by the Yalies afforded a frame for
those secluded efforts.  A happy exercise, not regretted (tho repeated
receipt of those standard no-thanks letters tends to stifle enthusiasm).

Point: majority of entrants in such MS contests are folk who've had zero
poetry-books published (that's indeed Yale Series rule #1, #2 being their
40-year cutoff) -- or (for certain contests) a single vol. somewhere. Some
series only accept MSS from those in category zero or category one (so
to sprach); still other such series are more catholic in their tonnage.

I recall getting a condolence note from the Nat'l Poetry Series, mentioning
that they received, that year 1,200 manuscripts.  (As a consortium of five
decent poetry publishers, each branch juried by its own poet-judge, that
Series holds especially broad allure.)

So, yep: it's the great unwashed -- un- (or under)published hoi polloi of
scribblers who keep those little water-wheels turning.  If retrospectively
the contest game looks ludicrous, that's perhaps a particular instance of a
darn general phenomenon.

Haven't looked at what Sun & Moon has issued in the brief span of its
contest procedure, but no doubt Doug Messerli and his brood are up to
some good.  Surely the aim is to open a more experimentalist niche in the
little wall of niches.  As for allegations re: Jorie's recent (poss.) faux pas,
while embarrassing, these needn't, meseems, be extrapolated out to the
whole gameboard.

d.i.

p.s. to Mark Weiss -- it's hard to get thru to the Pope?  (This deserves a
proper Pope joke, but I lack the muster at the moment.)

I want to put in a plug for a new, fantastic poetry website called Idiom.
This is the URL:

http://www.dnai.com/~idiom

This site is the container for work by a group called Idiom, made up of
mostly younger San Francisco poets clustered around New College,
Berkeley, and New Langton Arts.  Idiom is producing great chapbooks
including work by Renee Gladman, Ed Berrigan, and Lauren Gudath, and has
hosted workshops and reading events for the past few years.  An
incredible amount of energetic writing is happening in San Francisco
right now, and Idiom is a great source for exploration.

Thanks for listening.  Enjoy the site.

I have to agree.  While we can worship production values, this is rapidly
being checked by the sheer economic difficulty of producing those shiny
perfect bound books at approximately 5K a pop.  We produce JackLeg for $200
bucks, bind it with nuts and bolts, and it sells quite nicely, thank you
very much.  Even if it didn't, we're not going to lose sleep over the lost
money.  This lets us focus on what's really important, which is the
writing.

As for contests, Luis Rodriguez started Tia Chucha precisely because no one
was willing to publish his book.  After spending a lot of money on
contests, he decided to publish the book himself, which went on to win the
PEN/Josephine Miles award.

I've been hitting up classicists for responses to my "epic" story. Maybe

an attempt to summarize it more clearly [after that advice and some

Let me ascribe nobler motives to myself and other publishers for a moment.
I'm interested in production (and design) values for four reasons--I can get
the books more places, they're more durable, the poets like them better, and
I think that the beauty of book-as-object is part of "what's really
important." But do it however works for you.
By the way, anyone who tells you it costs 5k to produce a book is a fool or
a thief.

Dear Dodie:

Perhaps my "attack" verb was
too severe an interpetation?
It was not my intent to cast
doubt on your experience of
the Sun & Moon contest. My
concern would be whether
not you initially queried Doug M.
and let him you felt mislead,
upset or whatever. (?) Without
Doug's response to such a
query, or his view of what happened,
I feel like he's been tarred without
a process that would have either:
(1) confirmed your sense of being
wronged
 or, at least,
(2) cured the misunderstanding.



Anyway I'm still curious if there
is a way to cure my own gut dislike
for contest entry fees. I don't know
if I'm basically Scots(ch) -- tight --
or are the contest operators of
America vacuming dry the witless
pockets of American poets as "we"
stream hat, wallet and manuscript
in hand in search of a highly
problematic and stingy grail(?).

I think you do have a valid point there, Stephen, but I guess the form
letter I received from DM's assistant stunned me, the tackiness of that,
not even a form letter from DM himself.  And, besides, many women spend
years and vast sums of money in therapy to be able to do just that, to
directly confront shady treatment--when it happens, not waiting 2 years to
bring it up.

As far as contests go for writing, I think they're stupid and meaningless,
and it's sad that poets in particular are reduced to having to go that
route to break into publishing.  But I wouldn't look down on somebody for
entering a contest.  I recently judged the Bay Guardian fiction contest,
and so I've thought about this a lot lately.  Though the $200 I received
was nice, I did it mostly to get publicity for Small Press Traffic, having
"Dodie Bellamy, director of Small Press Traffic," in the paper week after
week.  Basically, I don't think the contest represents The Best in Bay Area
Fiction--what it represents is what three jugdes agreed upon one Friday
afternnoon while eating pizza in the Bay Guardian offices.  No more no
less.  The other two judges were a joy to work with, and even though the
three of us had radically different aesthetics, the "winners" were
remarkably easy to agree upon.

As I was reading the 50 so manuscripts that had been weeded out previously
by screeners, I felt a lot of sympathy and pain even for the losers,
especially since so many of the most interesting pieces had flaws in them
that could easily be rectified with the tiniest bit of feedback.  I hated
it that some of them might get discouraged.  And then there were the ones
whom I knew I wouldn't recommend and that the other judges wouldn't
recommend, but which, because of their mystery or quirkiness or narrative
drive, I read all the way to the end for the pure curiosity and pleasure I
was receiving.  In a way, I think those should have been the winners--to
get me, with a stack of 50 manuscripts looming over me, to read their
pieces all the way to the end, regardless.

I think that submitting manuscripts to contests and getting form letters
back is so dehumanizing compared to the "old" days of getting a personal,
thoughful letter from the editor.  Stories you hear about people forming
relationships with editors over time, and eventually getting published that
way.  When I got rejected from Dalkey Archives, for instance, I got such a
thoughful, encouraging letter from Stephen Moore that being rejected by
Dalkey Archives was a good experience for me.  And, I don't think one
should be ashamed of one's rejections.  Sarah Schulman proudly tells people
how she submitted _After Dolores_ twenty-some times before it was accepted
and her career was launched.  I must admit, though, it's easier to talk
about this now that my book *is* being published than before it found a
home.

And--I'm sick of talking about this.  This is my last post on this subject.

Today I'm sorry I started getting the poetics list in digest form, as all
these messages on book production values are coming at me all at once at
the late end of the day.

But, one thing I wonder  about is the equation of 'high-end' production
values with "professional" standards. It's just more complicated than that.
Some of the highest production values (the mentioned White Rabbit,
Toothpaste Press from the mid-70's to mid-80's, and others) were from
people coming from a bookmaking/hand printing background, and the values
were artisan/craftsperson values, sometimes transcended to become fine art
values, as in the case of Johanna Drucker, who worked for a time at the
West Coast Print Center but also began to make incredible limited edition
handmade books. But some of the mimeo, photocopy, hand-collaged books,
etc.,  with entirely different production values also helped spawn a whole
movement in unique and limited artists' books of another kind.

And I wonder, Hugh Steinberg, about your mention of perfect-bound books at
5K a pop, as you put it. Are you doing several thousand copies, or what?
Chax has been making handmade books since 1984, but we've also been
publishing trade paperbacks (almost all of them smyth-sewn rather than
perfect-bound, and smyth-sewing is a bit more expensive) as well since
1989, and never have paid even as much as 2K to produce books in editions
of 500 to 1000. But that's strictly printing/binding costs, not counting
design which I generally do myself, and not counting the various things
which go into overhead.

I believe, Dodie, your reference is to a response to a submission for Sun
& Moon's annual MS competition?  While I don't know details, it strikes
me as likely that the administration of such competitions is (I dare say)
purposely (& correctly) somewhat removed & secluded from a style
suggesting personal involvement (or control) by Douglas Messerli.
Why?  To strive for the sort of objectivity ("fairness"), the absense of
which (or the absence of the appearance of which, at minimum) was so
aptly bemoaned in the AWP / Jorie Graham instance recently cited.

Do you see my point?  I do know that Sun & Moon's judge of the
competition is someone decidedly other than Doug M.; but beyond that,
if Doug were to pen nice & agreeable personal chits here & there to his
friends who apply, THIS could end up in the Po-world equivalent of the
front pages at some point as suggestive of unfair favoritism.  In short,
that Messerli sees fit to have an assistant handle administrative aspects
of that competition, seems rather like a (suitable) response to potential
issues of ethical shadiness (or the appearance of same), rather than being
a case of personal shadiness.

Another question might involve how many MSS are submitted (also:
whether the submissions themselves are "blind," i.e., without mention of
authorship on the MS).  If S&M received (say) 500 manuscripts, and if
this was organized so that an assistant of Doug's were detailed to handle
correspondence relating to the process, then there's no reason to assume
that Doug was even made aware of those instances in which his friends &
acquaintances happened to have work in the running.  The competition
process indeed operates under constraints that do not apply to the more
free-form process of interaction with a publisher outside of the strictures
of a competition.

A week or two ago, the topic of entry-fees & competitions came up on
another list that I read in digest (that of the Int'l  Alliance for Women in
Music, IAWM).  There was a range of responses -- but many composers
noted that they make a point of never participating in such.  There was
also a discussion of the economics of such competitions (which typically
promise a cash award and performance of a winning composer's music).
The results of analysis suggested the likelihood that, in some cases, not
only were costs of competitions being covered by entry fees, but that
some organizations seemed to subsidize their performance series via
funds gathered thru competition entry fees.  (The general response to this
practice was that of being irked by it.)

Interesting to note these fairly parallel discussions in the two media.

I'm all for the virtues of clarity, but I'm not sure I agree with this,
Mark. It's always seemed to me that original or powerful or compelling
writers force the reader to expand by learning how to read their work --
which often appears difficult at first, and perhaps is out of the need to
break from what has proceeded it -- and that this, in part, constitutes what
we mean by reading. Which is not to justify obscurantism or defend
prolixity.

in a different site, I read Guy Davenport's essays & stories with much the
same sense of delight, & reread them for the pleasures of his text.

I have to say I agree, generally, with Douglas's agreement with Patrick,
but would like also to point out the following:

        From time to time poets appear, who, if they are accepted at all, demand a
radical revision of the         existing conception of poetry. Of this sort are
our modern poets, and herein lies the difficulty of     accepting them, or, if
they are accepted, the difficulty of accommodating them in the
traditionally   accepted pattern.
                        Cleanth Brooks, Modern Poetry and the Tradition (1939)

I don't recall the particular source(s) of these recent posts, and so am
not implying any direct analogies, but it is worth noting (I think) that a
large part of Brooks' and others' purpose at that time was to justify
literary criticism as a university-worthy discipline by systematizing it.

Any thoughts?

I'm all for the virtues of clarity, but I'm not sure I agree with this,
Mark. It's always seemed to me that original or powerful or compelling
writers force the reader to expand by learning how to read their work --
which often appears difficult at first, and perhaps is out of the need to
break from what has proceeded it -- and that this, in part, constitutes
what

I hesitate to continue a discussion that's already been beaten into the
ground, but David Israel's statement that

>I do know that Sun & Moon's judge of the
>competition is someone decidedly other than Doug M.;

in the midst of an otherwise reasonable (in the abstract) presentation of
why & how competitions should be fair, etc. didn't jibe with my memory,
previously jogged by Dodie Bellamy's posts, of an earlier announcement by
Douglas Messerli of winners and judges.

So, having time on my hands this morning while waiting for Airborne Express
to show up with my CPU upgrade today, I looked around at the EPC archives

<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>

and found the post below, which I assume is the one to which Dodie refered
to earlier.

(This might be a good place to note once again that, although receipt of
this e-mail discussion list in realtime is closed, secret, private, etc.,
all of the posts made to the list are quite easily available to anyone with
Web access at the EPC.)

Note the description, again reasonable in the abstract, of how manuscripts
are judged, then note the judge of the final winner in fiction.  Regardless
of the circumstances that may explain the lack of an external judge, it
seems there wasn't one in this instance.

A further tangent: driving by the Temple on the Beltway there is (or was
for most of my childhood) my favorite grafitti ever.  Just as the Temple
looms overhead, SURRENDER DOROTHY is spray-painted on the side of an
overpass.

I have no difficulty assenting to this - as long as we realize that Ariosto
& his confreres & connoisoeurs pre-wrote the critics into their poems.
Gave them their script, their opening. Encrypted.  Did you ever take
Advanced Literary Refrigeration as an undergrad?  Those old Seers models
were built to last.

Sometimes, as Wittgenstein pointed out, language
comes up against an ontological barrier, so that all
that's left is the gesture. Now that's what I call
a gesture toward meaning!

I was (however) only aware of the poetry prize and hadn't taken notice
of the fiction prize at all.  So, (anyway), seems my statement was only
applicable to the part I was aware of . . .

Just happened across Ronald Wallace's poem "L*A*N*G*U*A*G*E" in the new
(Summer '97) issue of _The Gettysburg Review_.  Was this already discussed
in this forum? (I've missed a number of posts lately.)  If not, it's a
grouchy, reductive little polemic against postmodernism as the poet
understands it, which -- as I understand his understanding -- dismisses
completely the personal, imagistic memory bank he claims as the true mine
for poetry.  It's an example of how non-Romantic (Modernist?) strains of
and claims for poetry strike at the viscera of those who feel their very
identities and integrities are at stake when the legitimacy of the
domestic, autobiographical lyric is called into question.  It reminds me of
how angrily some "free verse" poets reacted when the New Formalists started
publishing.  Interesting, in a tsk-tsk kinda way.

Although my records are currently packed up (I leave Chicago in two days),
here's a rough breakdown on how much it costs to produce a typical Tia
Chucha Book, as we have budgeted for it.  This is for a perfectbound book
of about 55 pages with a print run of two thousand copies.

Printing:   $3,500
Honoraria:    $500
Designer:     $500
Promotion:    $400

That comes to about $5000.  Granted, you can probably skimp on the designer
fees (we think our designer is grossly underpaid for her services--one of
the reasons Tia Chucha books sell is because they look great) and the
honoraria (we are able to pay honoraria because we have a lannan grant (who
really needs to pay poets?)).  You can print fewer books.  You can skip
promotion costs and just pray the books will magically leave the trunk of
your car (replaced with a wad of bucks, of course).  But any way you slice,
it's expensive and difficult.

If any of you have advice as to how to do what we do for less money, I'd
love to hear it.

Not being a publisher, I'm probably just blowing wind here, but I think
DocuTech technology -- assuming a publisher or consortium of publishers
could handle the initial capital outlay for the equipment, which is
expensive -- might have quite an effect on niche-market publishing.  The
outfit that published my last book -- BASFAL Books -- started to do this.
Once they've got the text in electronic form -- less and less of a problem
since most poets use computers these days anyhow -- they print out however
many copies they need without committing themselves to initial press runs
of 1000 or whatever, which then need to be warehoused for eons. Since
poetry volumes usually sell in quantities of one or two or three, printing
on demand from disk is an attractive option.  The big expense, I assume, is
the cover.  Of course, not every press would need to own the equipment;
jobs could be sub-contracted, just as catalog printing is now.  In some
contexts this practice could enable a press to devote more resources to
promotion. To a poet, getting the word out is probably more important than
a token honorarium.

In BASFAL's case, alas, poetry publishing proved not to be the profitable
venture they'd (unrealistically) envisioned at the outset. The first five
or six poetry titles were handsomely printed in runs of 1000 -- too many,
really, for a fledgling press with no reputation and no really big names --
and when after a year or so they didn't sell out -- thanks mostly to an
unfamiliarity with how literary presses find their readers -- the publisher
got discouraged enough to get out of the po-biz. The last couple of titles
were done using DocuTech, which proved to be better economically, but it
was too little to late.  Still, as the cost of digital technology drops
over time, it could benefit poetry publishing.

Dear Friends,

Having just returned from a week and a half
visit to Brazil this morning, I discover that
the New American Poetry and Fiction competitions
have been the subject of some confusion and con-
troversy.

My mail is towering against my desk, so I am going
to attempt to answer the major questions, but I shall
have to been somewhat brief.

First of all, The Contemporary Arts Educational Project
Inc is the nonprofit name of the organization of which
Sun & Moon Press is a program, our major program in fact.
We do have other programs, some of them linked to publishing
others connected with support of readings, the bookstore,
etc. But in reality, the two are entirely interlinked.

As a publisher, one discovers over the years that--if
one feels a commitment, as I do, to continue to publish
authors whom we have previously published and promoted--it
becomes more and more difficult to introduce newer
unpublished authors into one's list. Each year we receive
from 300-500 unsolicited manuscripts. What was happening
before I began the New American Poetry and Fiction compe-
titions, was that it became increasingly difficult simply
to read these manuscripts and they were remaining for long
periods of time in the office, with little chance of pub-
lication. As an author, I shared the feeling of many of
those who submitted: a frustration at having a manuscript
sit on a publishers reading pile for four-eight months,
only to be returned with a simple rejection. Yet, there
was no other way to handle the volume of manuscripts we
received; and there was no money to hire someone else
to read them, even if I had highly trusted that reader's
intuition.

At the same time, there was little possibility that
new authors could be introduced into our list. The competitions
seemed a solution. By requiring a relatively inexpensive
entry fee, the entrants themselves would help to pay for
the publication of a selected manuscript that would represent
someone outside of the group of American authors already published
by the press. And--perhaps most importantly--all mansucripts would
receive a true reading.

In poetry indeed,this has worked very nicely. In fiction,
however, it became apparent that it would be very difficult
to find an outside reader. Indeed it became impossible to find
a reader (whom we could not afford to pay) who would commit
to reading 100+ manuscripts. I asked several ficiton writers
who simply could not commit the time needed to read that many
manuscipts. So, I became that reader.

In all of this Dodie is, accordingly, quite accurate. She
was encouraged to send an entry fee (without it, we could not
have even considered publishing her work), and she was told
that there would be an outside reader, and there was not.
I feel, perhaps, that the only error I made was not notifying
everyone who had entered that I indeed was the reader (although
I would remind them, that had they submitted the manuscript in
years earlier, I also would have been the only reader). As most
of you know, this has not at all been the case in poetry, where
it has been easier to find readers. I will try even harder this
next year to find a qualified outside reader for the competition,
and I am certainly open to suggestions.

In fact, Dodie's reader (myself) was sympathetic to her work. It
simply was not chosen.

I do feel, however, that the competitions have allowed writers
to be published that we could otherwise not have published. Even
though the application fees do not pay for even 1/2 of the actual
publication costs, it does help fund the books, and it does allow
us to open Sun & Moon Press to American writers whose work would
otherwise receive a cursory reading or be rejected out of hand for lack
of funds.

I have listed below the winners of the New American Poetry and
Fiction competitions to date.

This is clearly a case in which epic list gossip has led to a possible
improvement in the US literary scene.[1]

Congratulations, Doug, for your publishing work over the years.
Congratulations, Dodie, for speaking up.

My suggestion for the problem of finding a fiction judge:
initiate a Fiction Judge Contest, in which for a nominal entry fee
of $45-50. people would have a chance to funnel out a historic
player clothed with the moon & the sun.  The fee would pay for the
judge.

Congratulations, Jack Spandrift, for this wonderful suggestion, which
I pass along.

I am trying to put together a survey of 20th-century Asian-American lit,
and while I have found many contemporary texts to teach, I am
having trouble with finding texts from 1900 to about 1950. I have found
some excellent autobiographical texts, but I am desperately in need of
some ideas for poetry and fiction.

Q: are the ratios of incoming ms to published ms different than the ratios of
incoming contest ms/to winners?

How can anyone ask poets of all artists- (a successful painter (rare) does
make money... a successful poet (rarer) simply does not.... to then ask sd
poet to PAY to be read is sinful....
Publish what YOU love. Drop the pretense of discovering the NEW GREAT LIT.
then when you loose money it ant a waste of YOUR time and YOUR money.

IF WE WANT THIS TYPE OF COMPETITION THEN WE SHOULD ALL GO INTO THE STOCK

A tangent to a tangent:

Ever since getting Robert Archambeau's interesting biblio. to the lang. of
schizophrenia I've been digging around for an article by Roman Jakobson
[with Grete L=FCbbe-Grothues].  I've finally found it.  It's called "The
Language of Schizophrenia: H=F6lderlin's Speech and Poetry" [in _Verbal Art,
Verbal Sign, Verbal Time_, reprinted from _Poetics Today_ vol. 2, No. 1a
(1980)].

Interesting stuff.  Apparently, H's schizophrenia drove him to bizarre
language behavior that scared off or overwhelmed most of his friends and
relatives.  Dialogue with him was hardly possible. Besides typical things
like being unable to look people in the eye, and a strong desire to avoid
saying 'yes' or 'no', H also had a habit of addressing his interlocutor as
'Yr Highness' or 'Yr Majesty', and and even 'Yr Grace' and 'Yr Holiness.'
He refused any gifts of books, ate alone, etc.

It gets more curious. He refused to acknowledge his own name [preferred
'Killalusimeno' or 'Scardanelli' or 'Scaliger Rosa' -- Jakobson sees
anagrams of 'H=F6lderlin' in some of this], and essentially eliminated 'I'
from his so-called conversations.

This is what might interest poets: all the while that he was behaving like
this, H could sit down, in the presence of visitors, and crank out
exquisite, metrically perfect poems [he used to whip them off in minutes
for his landlord, while never addressing him]. [Unfortunately the poems are
not provided in the article, and I haven't read them]. Jakobson's analysis
is fascinating but I won't go into details. Here's just one line that is
briefly cited:

"But what remains is brought about by poets"

What interests me is the apparent autonomy of the poetic function from the
social, from dialogue, etc. Any thoughts on this?

I just picked Ron's name out of a hat, thinking of the anthology. My
undelivered meaning was: If a reader goes there to find someone better
known, like Djuna Barnes from the modernist era, and discovers a new young
writer like James Sherry, then it's good. Ms. Bellamy, like myself, takes
a special interest in writing by women, so I hoped that Djuna Barnes'
SMOKE and Other Stories would remind her of what is good about Sun and
Moon.

Please remember, all, that most small presses operate in the red and any
money you send them, be it for a contest or when buying a book, helps all
of us. I feel defensive on behalf of small presses, and will usually jump
into a fray if I think one is under fire.

On the other hand, I don't enter contests because I never win.

It may not be my place to post this information, but I feel compelled to in
the interests of those who may care and who won't find out otherwise. I hope
I'm not committing a violation of privacy.  I've just learned that Ed Dorn
has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and has only a few months, so
doctors think, to live.

I know there are more than a few people on this list who have a legitimate
bone to pick with Ed, and I don't mean to trivialize the issue by resorting
to such a mild colloquialism. Despite all the acrimony that raged around his
name on this list in the past, I found him, in my brief and quite
insignificant association with him over the past semester, to be a gentle
soul with a passionate love for poetry and a waggish bemusement at the
endless disparities of humanity.

The first instance in my awareness of the process Fred Muratori describes
was e.g. press, in San francisco, then run by David Highsmith. (This is the
process whereby as many copies are printed, 50 or 100 At a time, as there
is demand for.) My book the press did was _You See, Parts I & II_, a
collaboration with Opal Nations, in 1985. Highsmith did numerous titles
before handing the press on to Gary Sullivan. I don't know if it has been
allowed to go dormant. db

Well, not to be overly cryptic, here's an annotation to my annotation:

>> What is. . .  the average velocity of an unladen sparrow?
>
>1. mightn't the po-folk at The New Yorker have an opinion on this?

Sparrow (as you mightn't know) is the name of a (as the argot has it)
downtown poet in NYC who (along w/ a number of others) is said to
have staged -- maybe 2 years ago? -- a daily sit-in-style protest at the
offices of The New Yorker.  The issue was what is (or more pointedly,
isn't) included in said magazine's weekly poetry selection.

Seems Sparrow somewhat prevailed (and/or was bought off -- depending
on p.o.v.):  the august zine agreed to publish a couple of his own poems.
I recall reading one brief poem of his some time ago in there.  [It
concerned a snowman and paternity, I think.]  There was also one of
those quaint Talk Of The Town tales, giving the story of Sparrow's sit-in
in some of its quaint particulars.

(I'm acquainted w/ Sparrow on account of we both used to participate in
the 200-copy xerox poets' circular *Tamarind* -- & I'd assume he still
does). . . . end of footnote

Subject:      another production idea
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Here's an inexpensive production alternative using binding machines that
you can buy from your local stationery store. There are basically two
types of machines. One punches a bunch of holes through the pages of your
book and then threads a plastic comb through the holes. For about a dollar
or less, you can buy the comb and a cover that you can run through a laser
printer. So, if you have a way to do xeroxes cheaply, you can buy the
machine and bind only as many books as you sell. The unit cost may be
higher per book, but you can print and bind completely on demand. Instead
of $2,000 to $5,000 upfront for a run plus inventory carrying costs, etc.,
you can do about 100 books for $500 and less if you have access to a
copier. This includes an amorized cost for the binding machine which
ranges from $400 to $600.

An even cheaper binding system can be bought for $90 to $200 which uses a
thermal system to bind sheets of paper between various types of covers.
You stick the cover in the machine, put the sheets of your book in the
cover and turn on the machine. It heats the glue in the cover's spine, the
sheets of paper sink into the glue and the whole thing binds together when
the machine cools down. It ain't fast, but it can make a very presentable
binding. Either of the systems would seem to work quite well for poetry
books since you will probably never have to make more than a few books at
a time.

The disadvantage is that the books are probably not of a sufficient
quality to sell to libraries or to be handled by distributors, although it
would be interesting if there is anybody with knowledge of Sm. Press
Distr. who could say whether they would handle this type of book.

The systems I'm talking about are made by GBC and Avery Dennison. Like I
said, most decent sized stationers could order the machine for you. And,
for those who don't have the money to buy the binder by themselves, you
could certainly share the cost and machine with other nearby publishers.

cheers,
Steven

p.s. I used to work in a stationery store (J. Solomon, Inc.). That's how I
know about this stuff.

If we put the MBA analystical hat
on for a moment -- do not include
obvious vanity presses & magazines
in which entry fees are practically
automatic exchange for publication --
am I alone in thinking that application
fees for consideration in book awards
and various contests rose dramatically
as a phenomen with the decline of
NEA and States funding for small
presses and magazines? From a publisher's
point of view the entry fee became
alternative way of raising production money,
as well as a way to tighten the filter on
the receipt of unmanagebly huge numbers
of manuscripts. I think Doug Messerli's
recent post suggests as much.
Ironically what is healthy or makes
sense for the publisher hardly
coheres with the interest of the
writer, particularly if he or she is
unable to shed money into several
contests.
In Doug M's post I was curious about
the choice of Carla Harryman for the
winner of the fiction award. I'm both
a friend and fan of Carla's work. At the
same time I don't believe Doug needed
a contest to discover and publish
Carla -- at least I don't want to think so!
It's my impression that she is quite
well known in new &/or experimental
writing circles. I do, however, think being
a "winner" will help draw attention
among main stream reviewers to her
work - which is neither bad for Carla
or Sun & Moon. But in terms of the
contest's goal of seeking to uncover
an unknown writer, I wd
suspect "the unknown" participants
are, at least, scratching their heads.

I would have published Carla outright.


On another note (back to the NBA
thread as different from MBA or
MFA threads) I don't think I like Utah's
John Stockton but he played beautiful,
incredible in the last quarter of
tonight's game. I think
Charles Barkley ruined Huston. Selfish
to an enormous fault. Instead of baskets,
he drained Akeem, and the rest of
the Rockets, right out of the game.
It was good that Barkley looked
desperate and lost trying to block
Stockton's winning shot.
Court poetry. I say.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

both types of binding you describe ("Velo binding" and the glue-strip
binding, not to mention a 3rd type: "spiral binding") are all available
nation-wide (that's u.s.a. -- don't know abt. other lands), 24 hours per
day, in (I expect) nearly every major metropolitan city, thanks to the
good offices (commercial instincts) of a company known as KINKO'S.

I've had occasion to do my own small-edition (e.g., 4 or 5 copies)
self-productions of MSS at Kinko's, and find their copying & binding
facilities decent & inexpensive.  (Not to mention convenience of being
able to show up at 4 a.m., or whenever.)

Never considered (conceptualized) publication via that route, but it could
certainly be done . . .

d.i.

(or course, those in Berkeley may favor [e.g.] Krishna Copy -- & those
elsewhere may find the same technology at other outfits . . .; Kinko's has
simply established the most pervasive commercial presence, seems)

"but what remains is brought about by poets"

the line from Holderlin is discussed by Gianni Vattimo in one of the
essays in _The End of Modernity_ ;
 he goes on to discuss a notion of
monumentality
The monument bears traces of the past into the future, for others; it
does not defeat time but endures in time, bearing the marks of time. A
poem is a monument by virtue of its having been worked, refined,
eroded; the evidence it presents, its relation to truth, is that of
the trace of an event, and not the authoritarian truth of metaphysics
(Vattimo, 1988, p. 74-75) [my paraphrase]

in the same essay he discusses Heidegger's writings on poetry;

I've been listening in for a while and have been enjoying a lot of

And the same is true of the '95 poetry winner, Cole Swensen (whose work I
admire, by the way), who was a National Poetry Series winner in the
late-1980s and already quite well-known and respected, having had books
issued by Quill and Burning Deck. No doubt the manuscript she submitted to
the S&M contest would have been published gratefully by someone else -- no
"discovery"-via-contest necessary here, either.  Still, the selection of
already-established writers from large contest pools suggests at least  two
obvious conclusions: (1) even established poets and fiction writers feel
compelled to enter contests (which unfortunately elbows out the
just-as-worthy but no-name small fry), and (2) even with the likely
prospect of publishing their work with another press, well-known
(relatively speaking) writers still want to publish with Sun & Moon. Who
wouldn't?

Yes he *really* was!

Well before his "madness" he had produced a translation of Pindar that was
so idiosyncratic [and so faithful to the Grk] that a good portion of his
audience thought he was mad even then.

And what did the good doctors think of him? Well, one called his late
poetry "a catatonic form of imbecility", whereas another called him "the
greatest of the schizophrenics." I don't think that they've figured him out
even now.

acrimony in that skirmish a few months ago.  people didn't like some of the
things dorn had said and done, and we said so.  not liking what someone has
said and done does not prevent one from feeling the basic sympathy when
that someone is terminally ill.

Maria, I'm interested in your point about discussions and personal
loyalties. Someone suggested, on the Pie Barrage
thread that we discuss the issue of sympathy. I remember reading an
article recently bitterly complaining about writers who reciprocate
positive blurbs on each others books. I've often had the notion that
writers emerge into the public eye by means of a circle of supporters
who either urge them on or egg them on. My specific historical examples
are the Max Brod/Kafka relationship, I can't remember at the moment Thomas
Wolfe's
friend who edited his works, then there's  Walter Benjamin/Gershom
Scholem, among more recent poets Ted Berrigan/Ron Padgett, Carla
Harryman/Barrett Watten,Michael Palmer/Michael Davidson,Clark
Coolidge/Bernadette Mayer,the terrific Washington D.C. circle of poets
including Joan Retallack, Lynne Dreyer, Mark Wallace, Rod Smith our own
David
Bromige and George Bowering, and then there's the phenomenon of circles of
friends, the Dadaists, surrealists, New York School poets, L=A school
poets, etc, even the circle of discussants emerging on this list.Often,
to follow up your point about basic sympathy, such sympathies can allow
space for types of collaboration and exchange that otherwise couldn't
exist, including publication cooperatives. Literary groups and
circles-think of
the surrealists!- are replete with examples of confrontation with and
without acrimony.While I agree that discussions are slanted by personal
loyalties, on the other hand such close relationships seem to be an
important aspect of the dynamic that causes "intellectual issues" to
exist at all. What are these issues aside from the relationships within
which they emerge and which so much concern other
relationships?Historically, thinking of such cases as the Dreyfus case,
Genet, etc, it is the only power writers have at all, especially now in
the
face of the philistines who take away our NEA's. Right now, in my
opinion, our writerly circles may be one of our most valuable assets,
well worth whatever risk to objectivity. The key question, I feel, is
how to exploit them communally to our best common advantage.Too often, I
feel, "objectivity" is used to bludgeon any space for subjectivity,
especially in literary activities. Perhaps in literary terms
"objectivity" is a tone, like any other.
Cordially,

Xexoxial which started out as Xerox Sutra in 1980 was founded on the
idea of books produced in unlimited small editions based on demand.  In
1980 when xerox machines (or copiers as we now call them) were clunky
low res simulations of printing machines there was almost no one in the
small press world going this route because the stigma of the time was
that unless a title had been printed offset in huge quanities, or
letterpressed with utmost care there were no other recognizably valid
ways of printing books.  Keep in mind that the punk/zine world had
already discovered copiers & much of these publications were in
circulation, but at that time I encounter endless resistence to the idea
of xerox books.  & strangely the resistence from other publishers seemed
to be more about the fact that a book was not published until you had
your closet full of 100s of copies even tho there was no one to buy them
or even stores to place them in.

Because we never printed huge editions XE has published over a 150
titles over the years, all are still available, still "in print" & have
lessened to some degree the glut of unwanted poetry.


On a separate thread, XE has always side stapled its xerox book & glued
covers around them.  Our hard cover are old book with the insides ripped
out, handpainted & our titles bound to the inside.  Not fine book making
by any means but Ive seen 10 year old books that are still in good shape
& certainly readable.

e, speaking personally now, if idiosyncratically, i think to some extent
that what you seek is *precisely* what a list like this can give, at its
best...

on the one hand, i feel very much a part of this network community...
speaking personally now!...

on the other, even if i do feel as though i'm not straddling any fences
with folks, i also feel as though i've got only one foot in... that is,
there is some degree of fairness possible hereabouts... "objectivity"
(nick, i think so!)---IF by "objectivity" is meant a personal pov with an
eye toward accuracy and being fair (i don't accept "objectivity" as value
neutral, or unopined)... at least, i feel there is this possibility---i
feel we can help one another, and i feel of course (as is always the case)
closer to some (of you!) than others... but i feel that the distance that
comes along with this particular form of proximity permits for support of
one another's work, by which i mean to include informed criteek, on the
basis of what we say, not some imagistic 'who'...

of course there are "who's" here... but they're not quite the same, *here*,
as they might be elsewhere... e.g., in the pages of so many print journals,
which can ossify personality and polarize dialogue... but i don't wish to
polarize print either!---i only mean to suggest that the flows here are
more quotidian, and helpful in this regard... at least, the potential
exists for 'personality' to function more constructively hereabouts... i
think in fact it often has...

at the same time, i don't want simply to trumpet these spaces as not having
their own peculiar conflictual problems... once a flame ignites, it's tough
to put out w/o a simply hug or handshake or what have you...

anyway, random noninklings... yes, to fairness, and to honesty that isn't
hurtful///

E.M., I understand how you feel about cliques. I'll never forget how
excluded I felt as a young writer.What I have noticed is that poets who
spend time helping other writers, whether by reviewing, publishing,
setting up reading series, etc, eventually tend be included more in
whatever literary activity is taking place. I think the idea of
literary excellence alone as deserving of literary reception is an ideal
that has become outmoded by the hostility and manipulative quality of the
current marketplace.
While it may be unfortunate that a period of apprenticeship that might
include
hard work in forming new literary circles and communities that work
together (like the early labor unions, perhaps?) the idea that there is
or could be a "fair" and "objective" selection committee is naive and
perhaps even dangerous in the current environment.Perhaps we have to learn
and
teach literary organizing as much as we teach the classics and
moderns...But maybe the weather is getting too hot to think about
all this so hard. I don't know- are we heading for the netherlands of
nomail for the summer?
I'd like to know more about your writing. If you can get with
"shameless self promotion" (a necessary adjunct, perhaps, to freeing
ourselves
from the committees and anxiety of influence theories of the world)
perhaps sometime(maybe when there are more people reading it again) you
might post a sample of your available literary publications on the
LIST. But if everybody else knows your work already, I'd appreciate it
if you would backchannel to me with some of this info.I'm concerned that
in the current literary environment without self(and other) interest
there
is too often no interest. Cordially,

...assuming there even is dialogue. I've wondered why so many lit journals
lack letters columns, editorials, -- even book reviews! -- etc.: the unruly
stuff that at least opens some kind of communication channel -- now matter
how severely delayed or narrow -- and imparts a personality to the journal
itself.  The effect of having so many poems, stories, reviews and essays
just stuck there immutably in print without any comment or follow up is
indeed ossifying, though some would call it simply dignified. Marginal as
the editorial flotsam may be, I often find myself reading this material
first in whatever kind of magazine I happen to pick up.  At least I don't
feel like I'm the only human being besides the editor who reads the mag,
which -- ridiculous as it sounds -- sometimes happens.

Nick--I think your meditation about circles of writers is on-target...They
are indeed the primary way poets (poets especially, I think) flower
outward and come into contact with the world.  I think this is only going
to continue to increase as a phenomenon, because of A. the cutting of
support by right-wing forces who wish to eliminate as much public cultural
space as possible, leaving the organization of venues and contacts and
publishing in our own hands; and B. an increasing homogenization of all
culture and art, as a general trend growing out of the shape of economic
life: whatever can be marketed, and helps to reproduce both profit and
business-class sensibility, will be given room and resources (e.g., stuff
that gets reviewed in the Sunday NYT book review section).  Things that
stand on their own will have wealth and institutional support increasingly
withdrawn.  So, circles of poets are both (as you say) a long-standing
fact of how people grow and prosper, and also something that will increase
in importance becasue of specific historical forces.

The one thing in all this, which informed the previous "cronyism" thread,
and which will continue to evoke lots of resentment and outrage is:  some
groups of poets are always going to have **more** access to money and
institutional resources than others.  The tension here isn't going to go
away, because the difference between groupings isn't going to..Much of the
anger about poets feathering their own (and their friends, and students,
and spouses) beds, has to do with the fact that **those poets have some
feathers!!**....most of us don't.  The best thing is to avoid the
temptation to spend much energy on such resentment, and concentrate on
cultivating our own networks, and using them to make the worthwhile work
we care about more accessible.  (I'm not under the misapprehension anyone
on the List needs lectures like that last sentence, really..Just sort of
thinking out loud....)

Carla Harryman (fiction - current) and Cole Swenson (poetry - '95) as
solar-lunar laureates, elicits a line of inference from Fred Muratori:

And another:  (3) the judge/readers won't *disqualify* an entrant on
the basis of that writer being already known & established.

I.e., could Sun & Moon take Carla's book and say -- Gee, this is
great, we'd love to publish it.  But since you're already famous among
our esoteric cove, ergo we can't let you win the contest, Carla.  How
about if we just publish this on its own . . . ?  I suppose not.

A flawless approach to this good-purposed procedure is not easy to
tool; -- but I guess backseat driverism has its limits (too).

I couldn't agree more. So many litmag pages look like tombstones in a
white field. I'm all for white space but what if it was literally filled
with marginalia. That would be visually and intellectually exciting!

There's a difference here between what I was saying about adding a layer
of professional bookmaking to the publishing of poetry and the extremely
fancy stuff like White Rabbit and Toothpaste. I just think that most book
buyers, including me, react better to perfect bound trade editions with at
least a two-color cover. It doesn't change the content, of course, but it
tells people that the publisher takes the work very seriously. Some really
cool stuff exists in xerograph only, but almost nobody buys it. I'm trying
to recall if CB & BA even trimmed the edges of those folded stapled legal
size sheets when they started, but I think it was the book from Southern
Illinois that caught enough attention to increase the sales of their other
books, and that's what it's all about.

Sales, sales, sales! Market share. Stock Markets. Welcome to the 20th c.
Poets don't get subsidized until after their established, and vice-versa.
Ye can weep, but it won't change. So put on a stalwart face and give those
books some glossy covers.

Personally, I'd like to dream of an internet utopia where publishers
aren't needed, but people use the opinions of publishers and editors to
gauge a writer without reading on their own. Plus, like Sanders says, a
big meteor could come along and wipe it all out. It's gotta be paper. It
has to have market share. It has to slip into libraries. It has to be
disputed among dull theoreticians. Otherwise it will all get lost with the
sunday paper, put down for puppy-poo.

And it's all so far from the real situation. We write as we eat, breathe,
sleep. We speak. We arrange the words as gifts for friends or as part of
arguments. Some say they desire to take posession of the language, but for
my it's all one. Eat/shit, listen/talk, read/write, wake/sleep. All having
nothing to do with being published or being remembered. That comes after,
but it comes with a vengeance. Hard work wants appreciation. So bind 'em
up, glue em, and slap on a glossy cover. I don't need any fancy
letterpress editions, just a regular old book. When our 'zine comes out,
that's the way it will be. Fred said we don't need honorariums, but
really, what other art goes so unpaid?! In the end, we only want some
R.E.S.P.E.C.T. (just a little bit)

When I was enslaved by a literary arts center, we had readings given for
free. The state arts agency told us they required that we charge a fee for
the readings, so we changed our policy. We got four times as many people.
It's all a matter of perception. Gotta be perfect bound, gotta have some
color on the cover. That's all.

discovered some very important facts: 1) Michelle Glazer's ms. was sent to
Jorie Graham by way of screener Kathleen Peirce. 2) When Ms. Graham
requested the manuscripts, she did so by *log number*, according to our
intern's notes; in other words, every ms. that she did end up picking
arrived at her through regular channels. As well, at least one of the mss.
she requested did *not* become either a finalist or the winner.

I am glad to discover that regular procedure was followed. I'd like to
apologize for any confusion or concern that may have been raised by
previous discussion on this topic.

I, too, am relieved that the AWP Award Series seems to have been
conducted according to the written guidelines. We can argue forever, of
course, about whether Graham should have picked her own recent student.
As someone who years ago had a famous mentor name him third in a first
book competiion to avoid the charge of favoritism, well. . . I have
mixed feelings on this. But those conflicts have been aired already in
this forum.

Two important points: 1) AWP seems to have done nothing outside its own
guidelines; 2) Michelle Glazer is in no way responsible for the actions
of Jorie Graham. I have not read Ms. Glazer's book, but I think it is
very important that we, as readers, not allow ourselves to be swayed by
the controversy surrounding its selection, but try to read it on its own
terms.

Bravo -- good damn points.  As for the second:

HAS anybody read the book?  I'd like to know if Graham picked a loser (as
she sure did with Mark Levine's DEBT, a National Poetry series winner I
believe, picked by Graham, who was Levine's teacher.)

well here are the dichots du jour:
    winner / loser
    credit / debt

if debt is a "loser" yet it's a "winner"
how do you credit that? (what are your charges?)

one recalls a bestseller of bygone years
entitled emphatically "Steal This Book!"

perhaps I'd buy me a copy of "debt"
soon as I'm out of it (so I can get into it)

if you liked debt, you could try the sequel:
Chapter XI (only in hardback)

Subject:      procedures in literary space
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

<rant>

Talk about litpolice!

1.
I'm not -- *NOT* -- a fan of Jorie Graham's work, but I hope she picks
whomever she chooses to give whatever prize she has to give, and procedures
be foutu. Ditto Doug Messerli, and anyone else I know or don't.

Does anyone in her right mind become a poet to follow procedures?

"Fairness" is not -- *NOT* -- a feature of any world or ecology. It's an
enlightenment construct and a weak concept. It turns the set of activities
it polices into a game. Literally.

Poetry is not a game. People must believe deeply in their activities and
the position they create, the world they create, and in groups believe
deeply in each other and push each other forward -- work and human being
(how are they different?). I want each of you to do that too.

2.
Literary space has no border nor inside/outside distinction. It's additive:
doing the work creates the space. When you're young and just getting
started you think you occupy no literary space, you can't get inside the
one you see. People don't seem to want to let you in. Later, after you've
made some work, you find that the literary space seems to include you in
some way (never satisfactorily, of course). All that means is you've given
something, done something, created some space.

Why is it never satisfactory? The conception you have of who you are as a
writer, a poet, extends forward beyond what you've written, includes the
arc of your writerly intentions as you understand them. But the space is
one of work done. There's a gap.

It's a good gap. It's called ambition. Ambition is good. Ambition to do
work is good, that is. It makes you put your work forward and put forward
the work of those who occupy your social mirror. It forces you to formulate
and understand, and extend and refine, that arc of intention that is the
to-come part, the most interesting part, of who you are as a writer.

3.
The entire function of procedures is to normalize a world whose existence
and flourishing depends on being un-normalized. Do anything you can to
resist procedure.

4. (snipping threads)
Speaking for myself, I'd be real interested to see Vyt's new Holderlin
translations, to discuss Dorn's poetry, to consider why one poses Ron
Silliman in opposition to Charles Bernstein yes or no?, to talk more about
French argot phrases based on the word foutre, to talk about why poets like
to be in groups, how/why the community of poets can subsist globally and
over generations of time so that I for example (you too, I hope) feel in a
community with Arnaut Daniel (it's the first virtual community), to talk
about the ways literary and scholarly criticism intersect new poetry (see
above, under "normalization"), even to discuss non-rusting staples, or Web
publishing. You name it. Anything but how to form into a fairer and better
committee to reform the procedures committee.

tom, i get the spirit of what you say, and i understand only too well how
the letter kills...

and i'm not wedded to the term "fair," either, but just so we understand
ourselves:  if i say i'm going to "judge" such & such, and that i will as
judge pick what i like best, then that's that... and if i erect a procedure
for doing so, and don't follow that procedure, and somebody calls me on
it---well hey, then, i think that anything less than responding to same is
unfair, you bet i do!...

but let's be a bit more subtle:  whence the impulse to advocate *anything*,
if that impulse is not thoroughly (as in 'always already') saturated with
moral-political-yeah-ecological-if-you-like
longings/aspirations/beliefs?...

personally, i don't hold poetry-as-a-set-of-practices unaccountable to
same, even if i don't think "accountability" as an accountant might... and
i'm adamantly in favor of working *not* to be programmatic... but here:
even this list, technically speaking and as you know, requires programmatic
thinking in order to function as such... and it bugs me to have to say that
i've never been associated with an institution didn't grate on me b/c of
its programmatic stipulations...

so one bind today, in being creative in a creative being in living so etc,
is in trying to find some space (incl. that arc of intention to which you
refer) in which we aren't reduced to programmatic insistence of ______...
but i take this latter as fully moral-ethical-political-blah blah blah as
possible... meaning, once i lay claim *mself* to acting in ostensibly
programmatic ways, b/c let's say i *did* join the club, it strikes me as my
obligation to respond in accordance with what i've laid claim to---or, to
change same to make it less programmatic, more hospitable, fair-er!... and
in fact, in advocating anything at all, though again this may not be a
matter of any but *self*-legislation, i would say that there is a concept
of 'fairness' thereabouts, therein, at stake... but that's between or among
us on this list, say...

perhaps "fairness" suggests a 'balancing' act that is just not applicable
to the arts... as in rendering a decision wrt a courtroom hearing... but
once you enter into the public domain advocating that this is the way
things will or should work, why then you're all bound up with what's
fair---in coping with conflicts of interest and such, even in being
self-consistent with what you advocate... one of the reasons that politics
per se is such a hassle...

fair enough?...

best,

joe

The Machiavellian poet writes. But I'm not so sure. I think proper disclosure
is required when a publisher runs a "competition" (requiring an entry fee).
The form of disclosure should be a simple statement in the guidelines:
The contest judge will have the right to solicit manuscripts not selected
by the screeners as finalists. Caveat emptor.

(I know of a case where a judge asked to select her own screeners. If that
was allowed, it should too have been disclosed in the guidelines.)

        As a person who made and sold hundreds of xerox or what i call
"XOLLAGE" booklets and broadsheets and so on--I think Pete Landers may
have missed one of the points of this kind of activity.
        It is precisely that it might have as among its intentions ephemerality.
        The ephermeral can be a way of presenting that which is fugitive
and resistant to capture by standardization.  A constantly shifting and
elusive language that refuses to be turned in to a glossary.  A way of
looking at --seeing and reading--things that doesn't want the panoptican
of normalized publication and reception.
        The pieces I made in XOLLAGE sold for what it cost to print
them.  From seven cents to 70 cents.  The money involved was
ephemeral--whatever sold just paid for more copies.  You were always
bascially a couple of dollars behind.

        The effect of the  work was that it got others doing it.

        There's always the hope that if a number of people are doing
it--there's a bit less normalization in the world.
        It may come with the dust and be gone with the wind--but then the
intention may be to not draw attention, to keep moving, to be mobile--
        Camouflage--now you see it now you don't--
        Deleuze and Guattari have something of this in mind when they
write of Nomadism.  But their nomadism is installed now in univerisities
and large tomes from presses with two tone glossy covers.  This is ever
the way of things perhaps as Pete Landers notes.
        But there's a difference between "getting ahead in the world" and
keeping on going--
        and  it is ever the way of things that there as well things made
and done without any interest in creating monuments--

        of hundreds of xollage things made--a few may be here and
there--unsigned to be sure--but for the most part long gone--

        depending on which syllayble you stress in its prononciation, this
word indicates two aspects of xollage work:

                REFUSE


                                !!!!!

p.s., Tom & all, spoke w/ Vyt on phone (he's managed to avoid the
online universe so far); he'll send me some of his Holderlin holdings
& I'll example some of same here.

He also mentioned, in passing, an early, epistolary novel that H.
wrote, *Hyperion*, which I'm now curious to look at.

Another remark of Vyt's: that some of his sense of Holderlin was
spurred on by readings in Maurice Blanchot's essays (wherein H.'s
poetry makes periodic appearance).

HOW TO READ A TESLA COIL
a tour of the show of artists' books "You Call That a Book?"
San Francisco Center for the Book
300 de Haro at 16th Street, San Francisco
Saturday May 31, at 2 pm
free to the public

Info:   415 565 0545, info@sfcb.org

The exhibition "You Call That a Book?" continuing through June 14, features
the work of 34 artists who incorporate materials ranging from paper bags to
condoms to Tesla coils in their imaginative and technically superb
constructions. This is a selection of some of the most inventive and
accomplished work yet produced in an art form most people are still unaware
of.

The tour will include informal talks by curator Steve Woodall, artist and
critic Frances Butler, and Mills College Special Collections librarian
Janice Braun. Several artists represented in the show will also be on hand
to discuss their work.

With roots going back to William Blake and beyond, the artist's book
emerged in the 1970's as a newly recognized genre in the world of visual
art. The form continues to grow exponentially, abetted by art school and
university programs, and the appearance of centers for the study and
promotion of the form, such as the San Francisco Center for the Book.

Long convinced that some people (including more than one on this list)
don't have as broad a sense of what's going on in contemporary American
poetry as they might, and that no one is familiar with *everything*
that's out there, I've decided to post my own (definitely flawed)
impression of the scene.  My hope is that a few of you will augment and
adjust that impression, and we can arrive at some kind of intelligent,
non-hierarchical, informal Master-List of Schools of American Poetry.

This isn't my first try at this.  A few years ago Len Fulton printed a
list of mine in *Small Press Review* as a guest editorial.  Alas, it
generated next to no interest, only two people writing me about it.
Poets and poetry-readers obviously have a prejudice against pigeon-
holing.  I keep at it, anyway, not only because I'm a taxonoholic, but
because one of my dreams is that someday someone will publish a truly
catholic anthology of current American poetry, which can't happen unless
some sort of list is available.  Such a list would also prove helpful
for indexing all the poetry that is now on the Internet, or soon will
be, possibly an even higher priority.  In any event, here's what I've
ocme up with:

    MAINSTREAM POETRY

What's in all the standard anthologies; Vendler-certified; many
sub-schools, some of which are:

      1. Iowa-Workshop Poetry (e.g., Bell)

      2. Surrealist Poetry (e.g., Bly)

      3. Ecological Poetry (e.g., Snyder)

      4. Jump-Cut Poetry (e.g., Ashbery)

    EASY-STREAM POETRY

A variety of poetry that, based on its popularity, ought to be
mainstream but is shut out of the major anthologies because academics
look down on it.

      1. Light Verse

      2. Haiku

    LANGUAGE POETRY

The poetry in *In the American Tree*, the Messerli anthology, etc.;
Perloff-certified; several sub-schools that I lack the knowledge to
untangle

    CONTRA-GENTEEL POETRY

All the 'unrefined" plain-writing poets inspired by W.C. Williams, Frank
O'Hara, the Beats, Bukowski.  (Note: I include the ethnic poets in this
school--but, of course, many poets, particularly the ethnic poets, are
in more than one group--Maya Angelou, for instance, seems to me at times
Mainstream, and at times Contra-Genteel.)  The main sub-schools I know
of are:

      1. Conversationalist Poetry (e.g., O'Hara)

      2. Beat Poetry (e.g., Corso, Bukowski), with several sub-
divisions

      3. Ethnic Poetry (e.g., Wanda Coleman)

      4. Pop-Rhyme, which sudivides into Rap and the Neo-James-
Whitcomb-Reilly School (yes, I need a less condescending name for this
group--and probably for the Iowa-Workshop school)

      5. Wild-Woman Poetry (e.g., Townsend)

    NEOFORMALIST POETRY

Poetry continuing the techniques of traditional English poetry,
especially meter.

   PLURAESTHETIC POETRY

Any poetry that mixes expressive modalities:

      1. Visio-Textual Poetry (e.g., Kempton), with three major and many
smaller sub-divisions

      2. Audio-Textual Poetry (e.g., McCaffery), also with three major
and many smaller sub-divisions

      3. Performance Poetry (e.g., Jack Foley)

      4. Mathematical Poetry (e.g., LeRoy Gorman)

      5. Flow-Chart Poetry (I've seen some but don't remember the name
of anyone who does it)

    INFRA-VERBAL POETRY

Poetry whose focus is the inside of words.  Taxonomically, I consider
this school a sub-group of Language Poetry, but it seems sufficiently
off on its own to rank as a separate school for the purposes of this
list (which is not intended as a formal taxonomy); Joyce and Carroll are
infra-verbal poetry's chief forebears--and Cummings, whom I've come to
consider more an infra-verbal than a visual poetry

    HYPERTEXTUAL POETRY

I know almost nothing about this.  It might just be pluraesthetic poetry
in a new medium.

There they are, the eight main schools of poetry I'm aware of (or
remember).  Any additions, corrections, comments?

Re: Stephen Vincent's Book Contests/AN IDEA & its comments on the growth of
contests as funding has been cut. It certainly is true up here, although it
has not happened so much with publishers as with organizations (The League
of Canadian Poets) & journals: almost all of the well-known Canadian ones
have contests in at least one area, some in many, as Malahat Review's long
poem & novella contests. At least with magazines, they do include a year's
subscription
as automatically part of youre return on the fee (but the fee is much
larger than a sub would be). Funding has gone down; contests have gone up.

Interesting idea, Bob, but clearly you left out a few, such as:

the Jacqueline Spandrift School of Disinclined, Dissenting & Dissin' Coyote
Poetry

The Providence School of Noisy Metaphysical Claptrap Anti-Non-Traditionalist
Old White Guy Poetry

I'm never sure of the point of taxonomies (re: Foucault) , but in any case
you've left out poetry which is ab nihilo performative - for example
www.jodi.com, my own stuff, the "Perl Poetry" in Programming Perl, and
even the material in alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb, which isn't per-
formative, but references protocol.

And as the Net grows, this will swamp.

interesting.  I wonder what proportion of the readership of these
(contest-offering) lit journals consists of those who're (at some
level or other) "trying to break into" the po-publishing game?  I'd
guess a rather large number.  So this amounts to a sort of (optional)
dues-pay for those [trying to] join the club?

Seem to be losing my interest in contests.

the more the contestants the fewer Countessas
the more the confessants the less one confesses?

Tom M.'s points were pretty good, with the slight caveat that those
who're encourage to send in $25 (or whatever) presumably shouln't be
misled into thinking their work will be considered if it won't.  But
at this point I don't see that such was (nec.) the case in either
instance lately mentioned.  Too, I don't know that Jorie G. shd. nec.
be limited to the opinions of "readers".  (When I was sending stuff to
such contests, I felt more distrustful of anonymous readers than I
did of the known judges, must say.  I tended to feel, if the MS could
but reach the eyes of the Judge, surely its merits . . . [etc.] . . )

Subject:      agony of procedure

Seems like a kind of romantic idea that poets are on one side, struggling
with their buddies to build a space for themselves, and the procedural
accountants are on the other.  There's a poetry of procedure, a poetry of
exactitude, a poetry of rectitude and precision, a poetry of fair play
and just dealing, a poetry of the equitable person as opposed to the righteous
or self-righteous person - the equitable person who doesn't demand even
his or her fair share, who gives way, who turns the other cheek - not
out of timidity or cowardice but in the knowledge that nothing under the moon
is quite right - and to give way is to perfect the slight or gross
injustice of relations with awareness & generosity - this is maybe the Tao
of peace or whatever.  There's a poetry of that - but it is based on a
clear-eyed awareness of promises, covenants, fair dealing.  There's a
poetry in all this - maybe a romantic poetry - but only to the extent that
all poetry is romantic. Or maybe English, I should say (what ho,
not quite cricket, old chap - not quite fair play, eh?) - Eric Blarnes
