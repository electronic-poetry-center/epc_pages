I had known Michael Gizzi's work and admired it and had been to a few of
readings of his but had never really gotten to know him. This past
April he showed up at a party and came over to talk with me. He told me he
was reading at the KGB Bar with Keith Waldrop. Unfortunately there was a
mistake in the listing and I got there right after he finished. He went to
have a smoke and I went outside with him. When we talked it was as if we had
always known each other. I was annoyed about the error in the announcement
and we commiserated about the inadequacies of the poetry scene. We exchanged
recent books, and I had the distinct feeling I had found a new friend. We
went back upstairs, Keith got up to read, and announced he had dedicated his
latest book (Transcendental Studies) to Michael Gizzi, which in 2009 won the
National Book Award.

The Myopic Books Poetry <http://www.myopicbookstore.com/poetry.html>  =
Series
presents Two Way Tarot Mirrors, a collaborative writing project which is
part of the Fifth Annual <http://www.chicagocalling.org/>  Chicago =
Calling
Arts Festival and Chicago Artists Month
<http://www.chicagoartistsmonth.org/> . A mirror can seem to be flat, =
yet it
can become three-dimensional and can lead to dream worlds. Unlike =
one=92s
reflection in a regular mirror, the playback/feedback in Two Way Tarot
Mirrors isn=92t an exact reflection of the original thing that=92s sent. =
As
Alice enters the looking glass, she finds that what=92s on the other =
side is
something different than she had expected; similarly, the two-sided =
mirror
brings about something different and unexpected. Mirror games don=92t =
end up
with perfect parallels -- i.e. Harpo and Groucho=92s mirror game in Duck =
Soup.


=20

Two Way Tarot Mirrors involves people in Chicago working with people
elsewhere, on projects that involve tarot cards as part of the =
collaborative
process. Participants include:

Fifth Annual Chicago Calling Arts Festival

Chicago Calling is a multi-arts collaboration festival. During the Fifth
Annual Chicago Calling Arts Festival, people in Chicago work with people
outside of Chicago -- both here in the U.S. and abroad. These =
collaborations
include a range of art forms, such as music, dance, film, literature, =
and
intermedia -- and they are prepared or improvised. Some Chicago Calling
events involve live feeds between Chicago and other locations. 2010 =
Chicago
Calling events include =93Bicycles and the Arts=94 at Happy Dog Gallery,
=93Translations 2010=94 at the Reconstruction Room, =93Seda R=F6der / =

Borderbend Arts Collective

Chicago Calling is organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective
<http://www.borderbend.org/> , a 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is =
to
promote the arts by to creating opportunities for artists to explore the
aesthetic geography along the borders and boundaries between art forms.
Poetry, music, performance, and the visual arts are no longer discreet
modes: hybrid forms, and interarts collaborations proliferate in global
arenas.=20

Borderbend events encourage artists to use innovative aesthetic =
technologies
and create strategies to engage and collaborate with artists from =
divergent
communities in Chicago and the world. Multi-venue performances of music,
poetry and visual arts exhibitions and interdisciplinary festivals reach
beyond immediate cultural and aesthetic neighborhoods to cross borders =
and
boundaries among participants, audiences and art forms.=20

Annual Borderbend projects include Chicago Calling and the Mingus =
Awareness
Project. Other organizations partner with Borderbend to enrich and =
extend
the reach of its project, such as the Experimental Piano Series, which =
is
co-produced by the Chicago Composers Forum and Borderbend, in =
partnership
with the PianoForte Foundation.=20

     Donations are greatly appreciated =97 they help to support the =
Borderbend
Arts Collective=94s programs. Since Borderbend is a 501(c)(3) =
not-for-profit
organization, donations are tax deductible.

Chicago Artists Month

Throughout October, you are invited to meet hundreds of Chicago visual
artists at exhibitions, workshops, open studios, tours, neighborhood art
walks and more in venues across the city. Presented by the Chicago
Department of Cultural Affairs in collaboration with more than 200 =
program
partners, Chicago Artists Month aims to showcase the extraordinary =
talent
and vibrancy of Chicago=92s art community.

This year's theme, "The City as Studio,=94 explores the impact of the =
urban
environment on Chicago artists and their work, and the contributions =
that
artists make to the vitality of our city. The place where art is =
imagined
and made, whether in a physical or virtual space, affects the idea, the
process and the final product. And the art, once created, leaves a mark =
on
the place it occupies. Chicago Artists Month 2010 looks at how the city
influences art and artists, and how artists transform the city by
contributing to civic dialogue and quality of life.=20

well, i think she's on record.
after all, Ms. Myles is internationally known.

note, the speaker of the set piece cleverly avoids describing himself.
although i wasn't necessarily describing myself either.

i do sometimes abused cheap puns.

Dear Mr. Russell:

If you were able to tell that Ms. Myles was a lesbian from whatever
she was doing ("lesbian things," after all, include brushing one's
teeth), then I am baffled as to why you would think she cares about
your opinion of that "pant suit thing." I find your thing to be a
creepy misogyny thing. Some of us female things do not actually dress
for your male gaze. (And no, your having described the appearance of
Mr. Downs in the preceding paragraph thing does not let you off the
hook for slyly making us guess at whom you mean by "Ugh/liest." It's a
societal thing.)

Plus five points for clever use of the space bar. Minus several
million for the visual evaluation thing. And who am I to be grading
your things? That, my dear sir, is precisely my point thing.

Sincerely,
Short Fat Obscure Poet Thing

music from last night and more

chris funkhouser's recording (with added small-club echo)
of azure and me last night performing after chris and amy
(thanks, chris!)

http://espdisk.com/alansondheim/adamzperform.mp3

i'm playing electric-acoustic oud, electric-acoustic guitar, viola,
electric saz and i'm playing them all too well.

so now i can retire.
i hate retirement (since the last sentence).
now i can do all the things i've always wanted to do.
i can steal from anyone, jail will last such a short time.
did i tell you i was the one who burned down brooklyn?
no? well i'll keep you guessing.

now if brooklyn burns down tonight for any reason you can say -
he did it. he said he would do it and he did it. you know he's
retired and he thinks that gives him the right to do anything.
well maybe that's true, look what he did - he burned down brooklyn.

i should add that even though i have a deep attachment to brooklyn,
it is not my native land.

since i'm retired, though, the whole world is my oyster.
however, it would be truer to say my oyster is the whole world,
especially if my oyster were our red-eared slider, who has not yet
retired (our turtle is very young). did i tell you i forgot my name?
did you ask me?

walking away and into second life residency and too sad momentum

the arctic overflows with mourning and uttermost grief of cauldron.

i might as well be dead.

I had the privilege of intro'ing Michael at that reading -- it was also =
the last time I saw him.  I hadn't planned to go to the reading because =
I was flying to Copenhagen the next day and hadn't even packed.  But I =
ran into him on the street, we had drinks, and I went.  He was laughing =
and happy, the reading was great, and I got to say in a public forum how =
much he meant to me as an editor and poet.  I am so grateful for the =
confluence of influences that brought me to that moment.

Russell's concern-troll question actually does have something to do with
poetry. Here, from an American Nazi publication, is an obituary for
Eustace Mullins, whose book _Secrets of the Federal Reserve_ is
Russell's source, whether he knows it or not.

http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/authors/Mott-Mullins.html

And here (shameless commercial) is a link to an article about Mullins
and his influence on Ezra Pound.

Alan Greenspan said in an interview with the PBS guy=2C what's his name=2C =
McNeil?  That the Federal Reserve is an institution that is "independent fr=
om the government."  Or go to Article 13=2C section 8 of the Constitution. =
 (I think those are the correct numbers and sections.)  Anyway=2C this is s=
o well known=2C it barely needs mention.  Less well known is that the U.S. =
declarted bankruptcy in June=2C 1933=2C and has since operated under Emerge=
ncy War Powers=2C with the Treasury Secretary - not the President or Congre=
ss or the Judicial branch - managing the bankruptcy.  Ask not where the (as=
 of a year ago) 9.7 trillion dollars of the Congressionally mandated 800 bi=
llion dollar bank bailout went.  But . . . shouldn't we be asking about tha=
t=2C then cringing over the supposed wealth of 200 families we don't know t=
he names of.  Hell=2C we don't even know the brand of sneakers they wear.  =
And we never will.
And sources?  Haven't time at the moment (a rare day of "going to work")=2C=
 but type in a few of the above "key words" and Google them.  Keep in mind =
that information from sites with names like Prison Planet=2C etc.=2C may be=
 a little skewed.  But there could be a grain of truth there=2C too.  "Trut=
h."  Whatever you want to believe that is.

WHAT: Prose Pros presents prose readings - stories, essays, critique, and i=
n-between forms by master writers. The programs pair two prose practitioner=
s linked by agreement or opposition, by topic similarities or discordances.=
 Meet writers new to you. See writers you know.

WHERE: The comfortable back room of the Lower East Side's Sidewalk Caf=E9 (=
home of anti-folk music). All readings are on Thursdays at 6:30 (sharp), us=
ually the first Thursday of the month. Food and drink are available; we ask=
 for contributions to pay the readers.

READING ON OCTOBER 7:        Phillip Lopate and Burt Kimmelman

Two writers born in Brooklyn just four years apart focus on the city they b=
oth love. Phillip Lopate, known for his delicious skewering of the chatteri=
ng classes, for celebrations of the city then and now, and for powerful cri=
tiques of the wallowing-in-my-addiction memoir, has most recently published=
 Notes on Sontag, and, in 2008, Two Marriages, a pair of novellas.

Burt Kimmelman will read from a memoir that reanimates the Park Slope neigh=
borhood of Fifth Avenue when he was a teen, when this now gentrified neighb=
orhood of restaurants and boutiques resembled Hubert Selby's Red Hook. Kimm=
elman's most recent book is a collection of poems, As If Free.

Apologies For Cross-Postings  --  Please Circulate Widely


CALL FOR PROPOSALS

The editor of a book collection tentatively called The Wild That =
Attracts Us: New Critical Essays on Robinson Jeffers invites proposals =
for essays that evidence the advance in Jeffers scholarship, especially =
since the publication of the most recent collections in the early- and =
mid-1990s.  Since the publication of those volumes, there have been =
significant accomplishments in Jeffers scholarship: the entire five =
volumes of the Collected Poetry and the first of three volumes of the =
Collected Letters have been released, Jeffers Studies was established, =
and The Robinson Jeffers Association has flourished.  Given the =
enlivened atmosphere of Jeffers scholarship, the time is right for a new =
collection of essays, one that significantly adds to the body of =
critical work on Robinson Jeffers.

=20

To that end, proposals are invited for essays that specifically address =
the critical sea-change of the past two decades, especially as it =
concerns Jeffers study, including but not limited to: the full advance =
of ecocriticism; the re-imagining of regionalism as place studies; the =
continuing development of cultural studies and the new historicism; the =
development of the New Formalism; the increasingly poignant vector of =
science and literature; the advances in narratology; the glaring =
omission of feminist analysis in Jeffers scholarship; the similar dearth =
of writing about the teaching of Jeffers.  The primary audience for this =
project will be academic, faculty and students primarily at the =
undergraduate and graduate level; secondary audiences would include the =
general public, especially given that Jeffers has long maintained an =
energetic and mindful readership.

=20

Proposals should be 750-1,000 words, include a clear title, highlight a =
unique contribution to Jeffers scholarship, and provide the editor with =
an unambiguous argument as to Jeffers=92 poetry, the critical tactics =
undertaken by the essay=92s author, and the significance of the essay to =
Jeffers scholarship as a whole.  The deadline for proposals is December =
31, 2010.  Proposals may be sent either electronically or in hard copy =
to the appropriate address below.

This collection, anonymously edited, collects the writing of a collective o=
f
poets that created a project inspired by a similar effort in 1906 led by th=
e
French art critic Felix Feneon. The original collective published (also
anonymously)haiku-like bulletins derived from the police blotters of that
year) where as the collective 2008-2009 collective focused on the accidents=
,
murders, suicides, labor disputes, and banal contretemps of early 21st
century US and (to a lesser extent) UK poetry communities.

All your favorite poets of today are caught in the acts of life's
strangeness and criminality.


The books is printed in letterpress and risograph with soy-based ink and
bound in Suede Tex papers limited to an edition of only a few hundred
copies.

one friend tells me that poets are about as enlightening when they discuss =
economics as economist when they talk about poetry ...

i'm obviously not an authority.
nothing new there.

another friend, a true wise guy, guy i know from the neighborhood tells me =
this:

OK.=A0So here's a more interesting question. Say you had a pile of =0Amoney=

in response to request for short stories:

Edward P. Jones (U.S.) He won a Pulitzer for a novel, but (for me) it's h=
is short=20
stories which shine.  Some are D.C.-based. All Aunt Hagar's Children.

Charles Johnson (U.S.) has at least one story collection.  To philosophy =
lovers,=20
however, I recommend his novel Oxherding Tale. And despite flaws, novel,=20=

Dreamer, about MLK, is absolutely beautiful.

Zora Neale Hurston, anything she writes is wonderful.

Jun'ichir=F4 Tanizaki -- long time since I read them, but man I loved his=
 short=20

***Sarah Campbell __*Everything We Could Ask For*__ : In this second
collection, Campbell's richly minimal poems come once again, as poet Zack
Finch has written "sieved out of turbulence," pressed to the point that eac=
h
syllable counts out from the unaccounted. In sparse and reflective
lines,Campbell's
poems move with an understated plangency -- turning the volume up at the
edges of ordinary speech.
http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/Sarah_Campbell.html

***Brian Mornar __*Three American Letters*__: "We receive, but how do we
speak?" writes Brian Mornar in *Three American Letters*. Part poetics, part
physical manifesto and essay, Mornar takes on the lyric in the gleaming lin=
e
between urban and outskirts, between speech and movement, in American
poetry: "...always on a string between the farm and the city finds
reassurance in this *between* as a place...Here we find our bodies again as
if for the first time." Mornar spins quotations into questions and eloquenc=
e
in 4 intertwined sections that move through the fallen utopia of Hawthorne'=
s
*The* *Blithdale Romance*, the letters of Lorine Niedecker, Ashbery's
distant rural patterns "thrust...into the urban present.", as well as
Benjamin's *Arcades*. Moving with a fractured luminance, Mornar asks what i=
t
means to be handed down language -- to read through one's place and
predecessors and to move back through such passages-- through "the traceabl=
e
topography of the edge of the throat's arches."
http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/Brian_Mornar.html

***Gloria Frym __*Any Time Soon*__: "In the case of Vietnam, what is a
reference" writes Michael Palmer over 20 years ago in the context of a
different war and different time. In *Any Time Soon*, Frym writes from the
reality that "there is no post war" or external context from which to view
our current saturation. Language occurs in the thick of it, taking a "swipe
at      "friendly fire"" ,watching "the poles and their birdhouses." Yet, a=
s
in this line, where political obsession twists towards avian respite, Frym'=
s
lines torque from exasperation, and critique, to tenderness. Or, to put it
another way, she writes "...I would like to find money/ you didn't know I
had/ Under my pillow in an unmarked envelope/ on a rose marked High Octane
Stocks// Can you handle this?"
http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/Gloria_Frym.html

***Mathew Timmons __Sound Noise__: Sounded through a persian rug (or snagge=
d
carpet) of google searches, Mathew Timmons pries apart how we receive and
process sensory information. As if search alerts themselves were as much
mirror as atomized prosthesis, Timmons replicates a pattern attuned to
static in the gaps -- one that signals the subtle difference between Sound
and Noise (and the snowy movement of the "static" image). Search here is
configured as a multiplicitous chase towards a broken prototype. But, as he
writes "I chucked the thought that it could ever be perfect again, so I
tracked down a copy instead. Then when I got the copy, I realized it didn't
fit like the original."
http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/Mathew_Timmons.html

***El=E9na Rivera __*Remembrance of Things Plastic*__:  In *Remembrance of
Things Plastic*, El=E9na Rivera charts a path between cultural displacement
and the hyper-pull of consumer images. Migrating from the strictures of
girlhood ("Marooned in a room the size of a dollhouse") through the
acculturation implicit in Garbo's eyebrows, Rivera laments the social split
between self-hood and the feminine body -- the insurgent exchange of the
personal for plastic that accompanies American adolescence. Through these
small remembrances, Rivera recalls the isolation of one between objects: "I
was given a shiny plastic yellow ring-shaped radio," She writes "with a
twist; you could twist it open and hold it up to your ear like a phone."
http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/Elena_Rivera.html

And, as always our full catalog of free books, including work by Tina
Darragh & Marcella Durand, Divya Victor, Norma Cole, Susan Gevirtz, Ted
Greenwald, Yedda Morrison, and Harold Abramowitz is available at

Subject:      Exquisite Corpse Drawings at The Gasser Grunert Gallery, New York

More than 200 internationally recognized visual artists and
photographers are participating in a major series of collaborative
drawings known as the Armitage Gone! Dance Exquisite Corpse project.
They will be brought together at the Gasser Grunert Gallery for three
weeks only.

As with the 1920's surrealist parlor game "cadavre exquise," each
drawing is constructed in a sequential combination by three or four
artists; one for the head and shoulders, one or two for the torso, and
one for the legs and feet. Composed on one sheet of paper that is
passed from one artist to the next, the process celebrates the themes
of chance encounters, surprise and radical juxtaposition. Artists were
unaware of who was participating in each composition and could not
view the image/word provided by previous artist. Works were created
over the past year at a number of drawing parties or were shipped from
one artist to the next.

Among the artists participating are: Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson,
Donald Baechler, John Baldessari, Ross Bleckner, Louise Bourgeois,
Cecily Brown, Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Chuck Close, Will
Cotton, Eric Fischl, Robert Gober, Alex Katz, Karen Kilimnik, Jeff
Koons, Richard Meier, Malcolm Morley, Tom Otterness, Tony Oursler,
Chloe Piene, Enoc Perez, Richard Phillips, David Salle, Dana Schutz,
Andres Serrano, Joel Shapiro, Rosemarie Trockel, William Wegman,
Robert Wilson and Terry Winters. David Salle serves as curator and the
project is managed by Tanja Grunert.

The works are a universal size of 16x30 inches.

The "performative" aspect of art-making is celebrated as the Exquisite
Corpse demonstrates how drawing and dance share an unpredictable
nature and spontaneity. Proceeds will benefit Armitage Gone! Dance, an
internationally acclaimed contemporary dance company under the
direction of renowned choreographer Karole Armitage. For three decades
as a choreographer and director, Armitage has actively pushed the
boundaries of classicism to create a contemporary idiom blending new
dance, music and art. Her dances are full of wit, humor and
sophistication and possess a fierce and sensuous beauty. Like some of
the best contemporary art, Armitage's concept of beauty involves
making connections between unlikely things. Karole Armitage has deep
roots in the artistic community and has been dedicated to fusing dance
with the visual arts. Her collaborations with artists such as Jeff
Koons, Brice Marden, David Salle, Philip Taaffe, Vera Lutter and many
others began early in her career an d continue actively to this day.
The Exquisite Corpse project is a way for a wide range of artists to
express their support for Armitage's work and also a way for her to
acknowledge artists who have played a large role in her career.

POG PRESENTS
October 9, 2010: Saturday - Erin Mour=E9 and Brent Hendricks -8 PM, St.
Andrews Episcopal Church (map), 545 S. 5th Ave., Tucson, AZ. $5 General, =
$3
Students, all ages.
Erin Mour=E9 is a Montreal poet and translator of poetry from Galician,
French, Spanish, Portuguese to English. She has read from her work in
English, French and Galician in Canada, USA, England, Wales, France, =
Spain,
Portugal, Slovenia, Germany and Japan, and has given seminars in
translation, language and construction of identity, and poetics. She is =
the
author of ten books of poetry, seven books of translations, and two =
books of
essays. Her latest book of poems is O Resplandor published by House of
Anansi Press (March 23, 2010). Her books include the essay collection My
Beloved Wager (NeWest Press, 2009), the poetry collections Little =
Theaters
(Anansi, 2006) and Expeditions of a Chim=E6ra (Bookthug, 2009) and the
translations Notebooks of Roses and Civilization (Coach House Books, =
2007)
and m-Tal=E1 (Shearsman Books, 2009)
Of her work, Melissa Jacques has written: "Erin Mour=E9's poetry is
fragmented, meta-critical and explicitly deconstructive. Folding =
everyday
events and ordinary people into complex and often irresolvable =
philosophical
dilemmas, Mour=E9 challenges the standards of accessibility and common =
sense.
Not surprisingly, her work has met with a mixed response. Critics are =
often
troubled by the difficult and therefore alienating nature of the =
writing;
even amongst Mour=E9's advocates, the issues of accessibility and =
political
efficacy are recurrent themes."

I touched the fur on her head, her head bowed, she at the edge of the =
bed,
sitting=20
bowed, I touched her hair, full resonance, the bell.

Flag lashing against the pole, no rain.

I leaned and touched her head, she did not look at me.

She touched my palm with her hair.

The flagropes tremoured.

Spoke a leaf.

About Thaumatrope by Brent Hendricks from:

Dear Reader: This wonderful book you hold in your hands (are those your
hands?)
holds your fortune. =97Gillian Conoley

Ante up: Brent Hendricks's Thaumatrope works like an ideogram thrown by =
a
cardsharp, a decapitated allegory set in "the golden age of little =
bars.=94
=97Daniel Tiffan
Everything
Friends should learn to think differently about leaving =96
everything goes away:
the sun, clouds,
even stars become nothing after a while
* * *
Remember when we found that old mill by the stream?
The fallen walls, leaves
dropping, ancient mounds
of archeology
Remember being 13?
The angle of the light?
And how we slipped down
into the smell of earth,
kissed in the deep gash
where the wheel used to be?
=97 Brent Hendricks
"Everything" first appeared in Ploughshares.=20

VIDA counts Publishers Weekly in 2010=0A--http://vidaweb.org/publishers-wee=
kly-kirkus-review=0A=0A=0A+ PLUS -- THE QUESTIONS=0A=0A=0AThis month, we co=
unted the number of books reviewed by authors=E2=80=99 gender in the =0A201=
0 issues of Publishers Weekly (through the August 23 issue). We hope you=E2=
=80=99ll =0Ajoin us in wondering aloud what these numbers can tell us about=
 current =0Apublishing trends.=0A=0AWe heartily welcome answers to a few qu=
estions inspired by the numbers posted at =0Athe site:=0A=0A1.)  Fiction bo=
oks are reviewed in close to equal numbers, which may indicate =0Awomen are=
 writing as much or more fiction than men.  However when we look to see =0A=
who is receiving the prizes, grants, and awards for fiction, the numbers te=
ll a =0Avery different story:  male authors receive the majority of prizes.=
  Consider =0Athe =E2=80=9CBest of 2009=E2=80=9D lists (here) selected by t=
he L.A. Times, Library Journal, =0ASalon, Washington Post, as well as histo=
rical awards for fiction such as the =0AL.A. Times Book Prize (23 Men / 6 W=
omen), the National Book Awards (18 Men / 8 =0AWomen), THE PEN/Faulkner Awa=
rd for Fiction (24 Men / 5 Women), the Pulitzer =0APrize for Fiction (40 Me=
n / 16 Women), and the list goes on (click here for the =0A=E2=80=9CHistori=
cal Count=E2=80=9C).  If women are equally reviewed for their work in ficti=
on, =0Awhy doesn=E2=80=99t the distribution of prizes reflect that balance?=
=0A=0A2.)  Nonfiction reviews are overwhelmingly dominated by men, but wome=
n=E2=80=99s =0Anonfiction seems often to be funneled into subcategories suc=
h as =E2=80=9CLifestyle=E2=80=9D =0Awhich contains Parenting, Gardening, Co=
oking, and Health.  Are these =0Asubcategories indicative of the balkanizat=
ion of nonfiction written by women? =0A Is =E2=80=9CLifestyle=E2=80=9D nonf=
iction-lite?  Which subject matter defines the general =0Acategory of nonfi=
ction?=0A=0A3.)  Though fiction written by women is reviewed equally with m=
en=E2=80=99s, the leap =0Afrom book to audio is made largely by male-author=
ed titles.  Does the selection =0Aof books to audio reflect prize-worthy pi=
cks or are the audio books simply =0Atargeted towards a male audience?=0A=
=0A4.) Poetry is one genre where women seem to be well received these days,=
 and =0Ayet, the reviews evidence a primary interest in poetry written by m=
en.  Is the =0Aattention women poets seem to be receiving merely reflective=
 of an increase in =0Aawareness of women=E2=80=99s poetry but not in equal =
measure?=0A=0A5.) Are more men defining and interpreting religion in books =
than women?   Or =0Aare female-friendly religions like Wicca and neo-pagani=
sm only coming into their =0Aown and making their way from the New Age nich=
e onto Christianity-dominated =0AReligion lists?=0A=0A6.)  In conversation =
with women who write Children=E2=80=99s Literature, I=E2=80=99ve learned =
=0Athat the genre is considered, by some, a warm up for writing adult ficti=
on and =0Ashould not be noted on resumes or in conversation in lieu of more=
 =E2=80=9Cserious, =0Aadult=E2=80=9D work.   Does this prejudice reflect th=
e fact that these books are =0Apredominantly authored by women?  Are fewer =
men writing children=E2=80=99s books because =0Athe work of rearing childre=

PROXY GALLERY (now showing: the spain collection): Select and assemble your own
custom art exhibition with catalogue! Ultra hi-res art files, suitable for
printing, are delivered in one custom pdf/ebook. Thousands of enlarged (custom,
patented algorithms) and enhanced photographs (now, likely several hundred
thousands, soon over a million,) mostly low-res cellphone, web-cam, and low-end
digital camera self-portraits (self-packaging), culled from dating/social
websites -- as you might expect, there is some explicit content (more than is
permitted here unfortunately: you really should see them all, but it probably
makes little difference) -- fascinating and occasionally disturbing. I've decided
to also add a set of painting-filters -- this was good, as it enabled a
'recovery' of many more worthwhile images, and also clouded any possible
erogenous/irregular corporate claims, but the project now extends beyond my
life-span. I could easily make small paintings from these images but who support
that activity? Let's see: commissioned portrait paintings, I'm thinking 12"
square encaustic on panels, from your choice of subject are available for
$15,000US. It's interesting to find the balance/inertia point between the look of
photo and painting, and it speaks to the current social/heroic condition! Often
it makes faces look squinty so it's necessary to 'bring-back' facial aspects. The
display images on this site are but quick approximations of the larger art files
which simply don't scale -- kinda like paint on canvas. Another advantage of the
painting filters is that they drastically reduce the file sizes and make it
well-nigh impossible for someone to covertly res-up these display images for
printing. It's quite incredible to realize that many of these pictures were only
3-4K or so when I started to work on them. You may realize that this is not the
first time I've collected anonymous found-public imagery: notably dumpster-diving
(bicycling with backpack at midnight,) at photofinishers' in the 70's. And of
course, there's the "Insatiable Abstraction Engine" -- collections from
newsgroups. [http://bbrace.net/insatiable-abstraction.html] But come to think it,
nearly all my work involves repeated multiples or collections of imagery. My new
friends. Whenever possible I retained any color casts, cropping and lighting. The
portraits are actually very considered, sometimes selections made/altered merely
to obscure the identity that they wished to presumably portray initially.
Sunglasses are a popular ruse, as are close-ups of cleavage, butts, tattoos, feet
and groins. (Curiously, I've yet to see a picture of hands... ok, now I have:
some intricate fingernails and the love/hate finger-tats.) Many
feature-obilerating camera-flash-portraits in the bathroom mirror. Many of
course, occur in and around motorized vehicles. Only one (so far) in a grocery
store. And some, but surprisingly few, are filched from somewhere online, but
this must be a risky choice in the event of an 'actual encounter.' How much
introductory information/description do you want to put out there to begin with?
There are some very creative, even artful, solutions to this dilemma. Various
select groups of portraits are included in each PDF 500-page ebook/catalogue for
$250 (sorry about the price but it was a hellish amount of work and I guarantee
you won't be disappointed or YMB), and can be ordered directly. The images
contain sufficient resolution to print them out on letter-size/A4 paper (or
coffee-mugs, keychains, magnets, photo-stamps, cards, calendars, tea-towels...),
for an instant exhibition. Use my verified Paypal account to have the DVD
delivered at no charge: [bbrace@eskimo.com;
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html] Or, even better, assemble your own
catalogue/exhibition at the Proxy Gallery storefront [http://cart.iabrace.com/].
Art files are only $1 each. My new friends. Having been recently kicked-off
Facebook (there was an anonymous report of a depicted nipple!), and losing 5,000
appreciative friends - it was the perfect place to host a social-media
profile-portrait-collection, I've decided to also open an online storefront where
individual high-res files will sell for only $1/each. [http://cart.iabrace.com]
How hypocritical to object to profile pictures that were on FB to begin with; but
it's fun to now position coloured boxes and bars over n

=93THE most seductive, original, impacting work I have seen for years. A
fascinating combination of Kerouacian street-talk plus a trip through the
museum of Modern Art in Chicago, plus a nod-off to Kosty's furthest out
experimentalism. Magnifique!=94  -- Hugh Fox


 "Carol Novack=92s Giraffes in Hiding mirrors our *weltanschauung* by using
its own language against it or by using its own language to pry open the
circus hidden within it. If we say the world is insane or we say the world
is a manic whirl, Novack embraces manic insanity with a great hug of
laughter. She flings images, characters, ideas, and language around until
they all, finally losing, - no, abandoning - their moorings,  collide,
crash, ka-bang one into another creating nuclear reactions of the non-sense
that is even Emily Dickinson=92s =93divine sense,=94 although Novack would
certainly hurl those two words (and that idea) against each other until the=
y
radiated. To read this book is to bring the giraffes out of hiding!" --
Martin Nakell


In =93Giraffes in Hiding=94 Carol Novack proves once again that she is the
all-time champion of wild, wigged out, original prose/ poetry and poetic
prose. The first full-length collection of her work, subtitled =93The Mythi=
cal
Memoirs of Carol Novack,=94 is a feast of fusions, inventions, myths, dream=
s,
forms, and possibilities. There=92s no one like Novack, and here she is at =
her
best as she chases her ontological tail round and round the intelligible,
unknown worlds of her subconscious (and ours). Think Alice in Wonderland on
acid simultaneously dancing with Tristan Tzara, Rimbaud, Oedipus, Pandora,
Gertrude Stein, Proust, Kerouac, and that weird kid next door who ate all o=
f
the heads off your Barbie Dolls and you=92ll begin to get a feel for what
she=92s up to.  -- Mary Mackey


 =93Carol Novack is a conundrum to literary editors whose ideas of poetry a=
nd
fiction as forms are rigid. To such editors, Novack might say, as one of he=
r
personae does, =91Your imagination has closed walls.=92 The best term for
Novack=92s typical literary form=97 flash fiction *qua* prose poem *qua *fu=
sion=97is
Novack=92s own, *invention*. Her eloquent inventions are witty, lyrical, an=
d
new, even as they reinvent the themes of family, myth, art, and self. The
crux of Novack=92s art is her imaginative power to bring alternate realitie=
s
to vibrant life.=94  -- Larissa Shmailo
=93She=92s great at creating a Freudian cage, & trapping the reader in it. =
'Tis
very powerful.=94  --Rae Desmond Jones

 =93She has the literary equivalent of perfect pitch, like those musicians =
who
can specify the hertz of birds and burps. Uncanny tympani!=94  -- Tom Bradl=

"Big boys in Ogboju style kept packets of B & H in their shirt pockets,
smoking once in a while to attract some ovation from the rest of the crowd.
How could a teacher have scolded or caned a boy that had a pack of
cigarettes in his pocket, or who, while still in school, had impregnated a
girl and would soon be a father? But some teachers looked beyond the
cigarette packs and the big boys=92 beards, not giving a damn whether a boy
had become a man, or whether it was the cigarette that was smoking the big
boy."

McClure met in San Francisco in 1954, and for several decades maintained =
an impassioned correspondence that touched on subjects including art, =
poetry, and film, as well as the peculiar difficulty of being an artist =
in society. The correspondence features accounts of their contact with =
artists including Allen Ginsberg, Richard Brautigan, Charles Olson, =
Robert Creeley, Bobbie Louise Hawkins, David Meltzer, Robert Duncan, =

century. Also, Rick London and Katherine Silver will offer translation =

Books--will try some other possibilities--but I recall that it was bulky
and none too kind to its paper cover after repeated fingerings and
flexings.

Cheers, everyone,

please visit Furniture Press to see the latest musings on the Undone
phenomenon. Here! http://furniturepressbooks.com/books/mccrearyundone/

And in a few weeks we're unveiling our newest project, Magus Magnus'
Heraclitean Pride, a creative-poetic treatment of the fragments of
Heraclitus: not quite poetry, not quite philosophy, now quite critique
- but all in one and separate all at once.

Plus... Copies of Anne Ashbaugh's Mythopoiesis is available through
pre-order only (until the website's updated!) Anne quietly but
concisely disrupts our intuition and values regarding greek mythology
and approaches it from quite a few, and disarmingly ironic, points of
view. A must if you want to see Freud castrated with a twist of
language! Any inquiries should be blasted at
furniture.press.books@gmail.com.

Christophe

I know what that is, Ryan. It's a paradox.

I had a copy of the prose poem anthology while I was a forklift
operator in a paper mill.  I was always afraid the boss would discover
me reading it & I stashed it under the seat.  During on particularly
hectic moment it fell into the motor & got shredded into tiny pieces.

I'm proud to be a part of this. Some enterprising soul has taken my poem =
=0A"Solipsist," from the Blazevox e-book Beams, and made a video for it on =
YouTube. =0AThe poem is set to music- a song with lyrics. This creates a te=
nsion and dynamic =0Aby which the lyrics butt against the poem. In this ten=

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CSoddoma: Cantos of Ulysses=
=E2=80=9D by Chris Mansel

Description:=20

"Soddoma: Cantos of Ulysses" is a travelogue of the grotesque. A linguistic=
 equivalent of a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Francis Bacon, it distorts=
, exaggerates and polarises the familiar world to such an extent that our s=
enses are drawn inwards to escape the conflicts fashioned by such energies.=
 As Mansel writes, =E2=80=98When confronted with conflict the mind re-enter=
s the body. You are going where the smell is coming from=E2=80=99.=20

The link to Chris Mansel's "Soddoma: Cantos of Ulysses" that I posted here is not working anymore. I had to make some ninor changes to the ebook, and after doing so a new link was automatically generated without my knowing about it. Thanks to those who told me.

The new link is:

ikely=0A> several hundred=0A> thousands, soon over a million,) mostly low-r=
es cellphone,=0A> web-cam, and low-end=0A> digital camera self-portraits (s=
elf-packaging), culled from=0A> dating/social=0A> websites -- as you might =
expect, there is some explicit=0A> content (more than is=0A> permitted here=
 unfortunately: you really should see them=0A> all, but it probably=0A> mak=

it enabled a=0A> 'recovery' of many more worthwhile images, and also cloude=
d=0A> any possible=0A> erogenous/irregular corporate claims, but the projec=
t now=0A> extends beyond my=0A> life-span. I could easily make small painti=
ngs from these=0A> images but who support=0A> that activity? Let's see: com=
missioned portrait paintings,=0A> I'm thinking 12"=0A> square encaustic on =
panels, from your choice of subject are=0A> available for=0A> $15,000US. It=
's interesting to find the balance/inertia=0A> point between the look of=0A=
> photo and painting, and it speaks to the current=0A> social/heroic condit=
ion! Often=0A> it makes faces look squinty so it's necessary to=0A> 'bring-=
back' facial aspects. The=0A> display images on this site are but quick app=
roximations of=0A> the larger art files=0A> which simply don't scale -- kin=
da like paint on canvas.=0A> Another advantage of the=0A> painting filters =
is that they drastically reduce the file=0A> sizes and make it=0A> well-nig=
h impossible for someone to covertly res-up these=0A> display images for=0A=
> printing. It's quite incredible to realize that many of=0A> these picture=
s were only=0A> 3-4K or so when I started to work on them. You may realize=
=0A> that this is not the=0A> first time I've collected anonymous found-pub=
lic imagery:=0A> notably dumpster-diving=0A> (bicycling with backpack at mi=
dnight,) at photofinishers'=0A> in the 70's. And of=0A> course, there's the=
 "Insatiable Abstraction Engine" --=0A> collections from=0A> newsgroups. [h=
ttp://bbrace.net/insatiable-abstraction.html] But come=0A> to think it,=0A>=
 nearly all my work involves repeated multiples or=0A> collections of image=
ry. My new=0A> friends. Whenever possible I retained any color casts,=0A> c=
ropping and lighting. The=0A> portraits are actually very considered, somet=
imes=0A> selections made/altered merely=0A> to obscure the identity that th=
ey wished to presumably=0A> portray initially.=0A> Sunglasses are a popular=
 ruse, as are close-ups of=0A> cleavage, butts, tattoos, feet=0A> and groin=
s. (Curiously, I've yet to see a picture of=0A> hands... ok, now I have:=0A=
> some intricate fingernails and the love/hate finger-tats.)=0A> Many=0A> f=
eature-obilerating camera-flash-portraits in the bathroom=0A> mirror. Many =
of=0A> course, occur in and around motorized vehicles. Only one=0A> (so far=
) in a grocery=0A> store. And some, but surprisingly few, are filched from=
=0A> somewhere online, but=0A> this must be a risky choice in the event of =
an 'actual=0A> encounter.' How much=0A> introductory information/descriptio=
n do you want to put out=0A> there to begin with?=0A> There are some very c=
reative, even artful, solutions to=0A> this dilemma. Various=0A> select gro=

=0A> $250 (sorry about the price but it was a hellish amount of=0A> work an=
d I guarantee=0A> you won't be disappointed or YMB), and can be ordered=0A>=
 directly. The images=0A> contain sufficient resolution to print them out o=

I'm proud to be a part of this. Some enterprising soul has taken my poem=20

CEDAR SIGO
ARLO QUINT
WILL YACKULIC

please join us for the release of Cedar Sigo's new book *Slivers* -
published by Push Press

FRIDAY,  OCTOBER 15TH   7 - 10PM

BIOS:
San Francisco poet *Cedar Sigo* was born February 2, 1978. He was raised on
The Suquamish reservation near Seattle Washington and home schooled from th=
e
eighth grade onward. In 1995 he was awarded a scholarship to study writing
and poetics at The Naropa Institute in Boulder Colorado where he studied
with Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, Lisa Jarnot, Alice Notley, and Joanne
Kyger, among other poets.  He has lived in San Francisco since 1999.
In 2003 Ugly Duckling Presse published the first edition of his *Selected
Writings*. It was followed in 2005 by a second revised and expanded edition=
.
Other books include *Death Race vsop*, and *Expensive Magic*. A second larg=
e
collection *Stranger In
Town*<http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=3D87286100628230> is
just out from City Lights.
*
Arlo Quint* is the author of *Drawn In* (Fewer & Further Press), *Hospitali=
ty
in the Forest* (Rust Buckle Books), *Photogenic Memory* (Lame House), and *=
Days
on End* (Open 24 Hours). He=92s the program coordinator for the Poetry Proj=
ect
at St. Mark=92s Church.
*
Will Yackulic* was born in New York City. Since then he has eked out an
existence as a flower deliver man, a janitor, a groundskeeper, a
construction worker, a barrista, a clerk, a waiter, a handyman, a dog
walker, an art-handler, a computer technician, and a professional artist.
Taking up writing is certainly a step in the wrong direction for him with
regard to making a living. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn.

& For The Curious, here's bios written for the occasion from San Francisco
for SIGO and YACKULIC (apologies to QUINT.)


INTRODUCING DAME SIGO


With the strut that falls somewhere between Cher and Trudell, Cedar Sigo
comes to Brooklyn yet again from San Francisco. This time he's got a new
collection just out from City Lights STRANGER IN TOWN (again?) AND a very
eye popping selection of outtakes and what ifs, titled SLIVERS, jez out fro=
m
PUSH. What remains most remarkable in Sigo=92s lines is the clandestine tos=
s
off that lets your lips quiver a bit while leaving your insides nothing but
a charred gushy mess. Everything arrives of a certain measure, steadied and
never left tamed.


What is THE MAN thinking? I cross the street to avoid cops, Sigo walks by
passing them up rolling his joint and lighting it. Nothing but smoke in the
air for the motherfuckers to stroll through.  Once off the res, Sigo took a
detour to Naropa, met The Beats and, more importantly, formed a lasting
friendship with poet Jeni Olin. In San Francisco he drums up support for
cosmetics at Rainbow Grocery. He makes his home in the Mission district wit=
h
writer Johnny Huston in a cottage that has housed everybody from Noel Black
and his terrific LOG to supposedly Janis Joplin once upon a time.


Hopefully he'll read one of his latest ditties: ODE. A listing of friends
failed and continuing, the lasting love pulsating into deep morning from
starry skies fading out. If he doesn=92t it=92s your loss. When he read at =
City
Lights his mother was in the audience and her cackle is most delightful. Yo=
u
may have heard a great deal of things bout Sigo, be assured there are a
great many more to come. The interviews will roll you over and the art
reviews have already taken an on-line presence. The unlikelihood of a novel
surfacing let=92s you know this ain=92t no shit-barker. Be nice to him. He
really is not a great white shark, so don't you fuckin dare punch him in th=
e
nose. Besides, either way, he's not going away. So don't turn your back to
him either.

Intro to Will Yackulic

Will Yackulic entered this planet through a malfunction in geostationary
orbit. In earlier years, many argued that he arrived by happenstance throug=
h
intergalactic travel. Evidence now shows that Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the
imperial soviet rocket scientist, brought him to us by use of a
gravitational slingshot. As a young prot=E9g=E9 to the scientist, Yackulic =
lived
in a log house on the outskirts of Kaluga where he ghost wrote The
Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices and furthered his
studies in astronautic theory. Completely bored with theory, he turned his
attention to other hobbies, including transmuting base metals into gold,
drawing crystals, and working on his magnum opus, Magic & Showmanship: A
Handbook for Conjurers, which analyzed every phase of conjuring, from
sleights, devices, misdirection, controlling audience attention, to
incorporating patter, and the effective use of assistants. A misanthrope by
nature, Yackulic grew exceedingly strange and bizarre to his fellow
town-folk. Most were struck by his inability to age, and were particularly
fond of his good looks and large hands. Never one for attention, Yakulic ra=
n
to the streets where he took up skateboarding and graffiti. Shortly
thereafter he was arrested for spray-painting =93Thank You for the Brain
Massage=94 on a downtown wall. At a public hearing, Tsiolkovsky was forced =
to
exile him to New York City in 1975.

Yackulic=92s early years in NYC are hard to recall, even for him. In fact, =
a
lot of things are hard to recall to him. However, in a letter dated,
September 1, 1982 Yackulic recalls in great detail on an old Remington
typewriter,

=93I can=92t believe how much money they paid me. I mean, hand modeling was=
n=92t
that lucrative to begin with. The only thing I got was free tabs of ecstasy=
,
and with the ecstasy always came the parties and the girls. But I wasn=92t
really into em=92 ya know, I mean, who wants to be out all night with a bun=
ch
of normies when you can sit around in your closet and create things.
Besides, by the end of the year I won=92t have to work at all. I=92ve been
tracking my hours for this consumer electronic company called Atari. I=92ve
already figured out the codes for so many games: Asteroids, Battlezone,
Crystal Castles, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Missile Command, Space Duel, Super
Breakout, Human Cannonball, Maze Craze,  Demons to Diamonds, Night Driver,
Radar Lock, Star Raiders, Swordquest, Video Chess, the list can go on and
on. But I=92m tired ya know, this isn=92t enough to  keep my attention. May=
be I
should go abroad and just skate and write letters. How does the Netherlands
sound? Or France, yeah, France.=94

In 1995 Yackulic=92s wish came true. He spent three years traveling Europe =
and
attended various esteemed schools such as Hogeschool vor de Kunsten in
Amsterdam then Lacoste Ecole des Beaux-Arts in France. In 1997 he was exile=
d
from Europe a second time for 15 counts of public intoxication, 10 counts o=
f
resisting arrest, and 2 counts of shoplifting. Once again, Yackulic found
himself back in NY but not without receiving his BFA from SUNY Purchase. Th=
e
next few years of his life are again a blur. When asked what he did during
that time I received a postcard that said,

=93Spent a year with some Shamans in Alaska. No mushrooms but the peyote wa=
s
off the chain. Did some rock climbing and learned to play the guitar, not
the songs with Dio, but with Ozzy. Sabbath is not Sabbath without Ozzy,
Moved to SF.=94

Yackulic=92s years in San Francisco span almost a decade and are marked by =
an
overall arch of creative ingenuity and variety. In the Lower Haight he
painted well over 30 book covers, made short films, had group and solo
shows, stared in at least four bands (Autopilot, OverGold, The Grenades, an=
d
one German one where he wore all white and actually sang in German), and
even started his own art handling business. In typical Yackulic fashion,
this still just wasn=92t enough. It seemed as if SF was starting to become
that log house on the outskirts of Kaluga. Some say he exiled himself this
time, others say he disappeared to Brooklyn for a modeling contract.
Gravitational slingshot or not, tornado life in Brooklyn has not been
everything but dull.

On a recent trip back to SF Yackulic was asked, =93Will, what=92s the secre=
t,
how do you do it all so effortlessly when it seems like you=92re sleeping a=
ll
the time?=94 In between a bite of taco and a sip of beer Yackulic responded=
,
=93You know. I dunno. I guess I just don=92t think about things, I just let=
 them
happen on their own. I just stick to my motto, MI COOZIE ES SU COOZIE. Are
you gonna finish that beer?=94

                                                                      --

it at the price it was. it has a blue-green color for the side of the pages=
 and the cover is a marbly blue mosaic  so you can't miss it on your shelf.=
 if you handle it gently it seems to survive. i had never seen this paperba=

mIEKAL:

You had a "new" copy of the anthology when I lived with you in Oshkosh, or I
was privy to the ratting process of your first copy in that sublime Wis
Rapids summer 1977. As I remember, we read from the book often--often
aloud-- discussed it, read otther books by the poets anthologized, wrote
prose poems voluminously (shit, this was a generative book!), convinced
poetry was going toward prose, prose toward poetry--we were always compelled
by intermedia/intramedia, moths to a flame. I'd argue Benedict's anthology
pushed poetry significantly toward what's now characterized as post-lyric
poetry. Flarf , conceptualism, et al, et al, et none, needed the Benedict
anthology as a bridge from modernism, granted among others, even when most
practitioners of conflarfulism have little clue what they are stepping onto,
into , out of. Let's give Michael his props!

Best, Crag

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CMargin L=E2=80=9D by Vernon =
Frazer.


Description:


The roots of Vernon Frazer's textual poetry lie as much in the free jazz of=
 John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and their successors as they do in language-ce=
ntered poetry, Surrealism, Dada and abstract expressionism. In =E2=80=9CMar=
gin L=E2=80=9D, Frazer's words and concepts play over the page until they c=
reate a sense that something has happened during each poem=E2=80=99s moveme=
nt. The poems, however, leave their interpretation of what precisely has ha=
ppened up to the reader.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CThe Jigoku Zoshi Hells: A Bo=
ok of Variations=E2=80=9D by Jerome Rothenberg=20

=20
Description:

=20
Jerome Rothenberg's "The Jigoku Zoshi Hells: A Book of Variations" is a ser=
ies of new poems following the method of composition Rothenberg had previou=
sly used in "The Lorca Variations" and in homages to the work of other poet=
s and artists. In the present set he applies the same procedure to an early=
 work of his own, "The Seven Hells of the Jigoku Zoshi" (1962) =E2=80=93 no=
t to annihilate the original but to bring it into a new dimension, where bo=
th versions can lead an independent if interlinked existence. The fifty yea=
r gap between them adds its own strangeness to the mix.

This 18-month transAtlantic email correspondence between Jake Berry and
Jeffrey Side ranges across and intertwines a variety of topics that include:
poetry and music; film and TV; the changes in culture over the past few
decades; the differences in regional U.S. and U.K. accents; the difficulty
of reaching the famous in order to interview them; the songwriter as poet
and vice versa.

"Ardent," an album I recorded in 2004 at Webster Street Studios in South Philly,
is now available free on last.fm. Several of the songs incorporate poetry or
poetic passages into rock songs. Three tracks espcially might be of interest to
those on the list:

"Streetlakes"

Dear all,

This show opens on November 5th.  My collaborative piece with Brian
McClendon involves the following:


Anatomical will be composed in three parts

part one: the texts

part two: the images

part three: the sounds


part one: the texts:

Two pieces of text born of each other, made with the same heirachy and
restructured similar words and phrases used throughout both.

Text will be displayed side by side or even printed onto acetate and
overlaped to show the "anatomy" of the structure, the words that appear and
reappear in the same places would be able to be seen to the viewer while the
other words would blur a bit. one type in red and one in blue (color of
veins, blood, also symbolic of boy, girl), which would give the reappearance
of type a darker color and still allow both texts to be read.


part two: the images

this is the second part of the idea, where we will use the images of anatomy
or figure drawings alongside mechanical-electronic sculptures on human form.

The sculptures and images will be combined into a video, which will allow
forms ideas and symbolism of both artist's to come together in some kind of
anatomical way, via the movie timeline.

Also, the sound part also fits into this, we will be tailoring it to fit
exactly.


part three: the sounds

The third part would be the sound part of the video, composed with sounds
that are relatable to the anatomical topic. By this i mean everything from
talking, singing, human sounds to creaking cracking mechanical sounds.

Soundoffka Vol. 2- An Aural & Visual Exhibition at VWVOFFKA

Release Date: October 18th 2010, Philadelphia, PA


Soundoffka Vol. 2 is an aural and visual exhibition hosted by VWVOFFKA, 2037
Frankford

Ave. Philadelphia, PA 19125. Opening reception will be on first friday,
November 5th from 6-11pm.

Closing reception will be Friday November 19th from 7-11pm.  Soundoffka Vol.
2 will be featuring the

work of Adam Zucker, Jason A. Maas, Sarah Weber, Corey Pace, Christopher
Gage, Megan Kelley,

Bonnie MacAllister, and Brian McLendon. Soundoffka is a series of
exhibitions in which artists

explore the use of sound as an art form, expression, and the ways we relate
to the vast aural landscape

around us.


Soundoffka Vol. 1 was a fresh collaboration between artists, working on
individual pieces,

which lent themselves towards the overall experience. It was also an
interactive experience in which

the audience became a crucial collaborative aspect to the overall piece.
During the creation of Vol. 1 we

also realized how vital the visual aesthetics of the space came into play.
Soundoffka Vol. 2 will further

expand upon these concepts of collaboration, interaction, and the
relationship between sound and sight.

The participating artists have been paired with artists they have never
previously worked with. The

artists will be exploring these themes through a variety of mediums. Pieces
ranging from site-specific

installations, video projections, aural installations, multi-dimensional
performances, interactive

soundscapes, and various series of drawings and paintings will provide a
fresh and palatable

exploration of sound as a viable, accessible medium.


VWVOFFKA is a multi-functional store front space located at 2037 Frankford
Ave. Our

mission is to provide a venue to explore everything and anything related to
music, art, education and

culture that is accessible to our community at large. We are open to all
proposals for exhibitions, music

events, poetry readings, lectures, performances, community meetings, art
making parties, plant sales,

potlucks, etc.

effrey Side

ndence/12675463
Excerpt:
=E2=80=9CI think we are nearing an end of game situation as far as the arts=
 are concerned. By that, I mean everything that could be done in painting, =
music, poetry, film, song etc. has been done. All that seems to be going on=
 now in each of these art forms is a repetition of achievements but rebrand=
ing them as =E2=80=98innovative.=E2=80=99  Painting is still feeding off Po=
llack or Rothko, and conceptual art is still milking the found object idea.=
 Experimental classical music is still working with dissonance and atonal s=
tuff. Mainstream poetry is still under the shadow of Wordsworth and Whitman=
; or if it is experimental, it is still operating under the fragmentation/c=
ollage aesthetic of early modernist poetry. Modern experimental film seems =
not to exist anymore (it is now video art) and mainstream film (since Spiel=
berg) imitates the look and feel of German Expressionist cinema in the 1920=
s. In pop/rock (the two have become the same to me now) the musical sounds =
are not as innovative as they were with the early 1980s new wave stuff, wit=
h its space-age synth sound and robotic feel. What we have now is fourth ra=
te Beatles/Doors/Stones wannabees on the one hand, and soul-based divas (Be=
yonce etc.) churning out substandard Tina Turna/Diana Ross/Donna Summer wit=
h =E2=80=98attitude=E2=80=99 and an R&B base run. There is nothing very inn=
ovative being done anymore. Obviously, this is a caricature and not 100% ac=
curate, but it illustrates a trend.=E2=80=9D (Jeffrey Side)

=E2=80=9CYes, these days it is anathema to do anything that seems romantic.=
 This is the horseshit of so-called postmodernism. Romanticism leads to Mod=
ernism and you must rebel against Modernism because, well, it=E2=80=99s old=
 now and you have to do something new. It was Pound though that said =E2=80=
=98make it new.=E2=80=99 Poetry has painted itself into corners all over th=
e place. The academic corner. The Beat/Hip corner. The exclusive avant-gard=
e corner. The anecdotal narrative corner. The poetry slam, open mic corner.=
 All of these are for a very limited audience. I heard Gore Vidal talking a=
bout the novel a couple of years ago. He lamented that the novel had gone t=
he way of poetry, into obscurity. Many people would object saying no, there=
 are more novels published every year than ever before. Yes, but have you r=
ead those novels? They aren=E2=80=99t Dickens, nowhere near it. They aren=
=E2=80=99t even Gore Vidal. It=E2=80=99s mostly pulp stuff.=E2=80=9D (Jake =
Berry)

I enjoy these descriptions of the weathering away of this book.  They
would quite a fine little anthology in itself.  Jesse

Foundation for the Arts Boot Camp Arts Festival. You can see the full
schedule of events here (http://nyfabootcampfestival.wordpress.com/schedule/

FESTIVAL<http://nyfabootcampfestival.wordpress.com/schedule/>
**In Abundance:  Poetry Reading Featuring Liliana Alamendarez and Wanda
Phipps**** *
November 5, 2010 at 6-7pm
The Bowery Poetry Club ( http://www.bowerypoetry.com/#Event/95992 )
308 Bowery
New York, NY 10012
Tickets $5 at the door.

Liliana will be reading from her book of poetry,* A Scorched Page*.  She
will read from some of her new work as well.  Her poems are inspired by
nature and every day life. From folks waiting for a train to the birds that
fly past her backyard, to the memories that sneak up on a quiet afternoon,
they are all fair game for inspiration.

Wanda will read from her two books: *Wake-Up Calls: 66 Morning Poems** and *
*Field of Wanting: Poems of Desire* as well as the new work, *Silent
Pictures Recognize the World,*written in response to static photographic
images which mutate in writing into film noir scenes and dark
romances. Stephen B. Antonakos will accompany her on guitar with tonal
equivalents to the poems. Her work honors dailiness, the details of the
personal, as well as the ecstasy of randomness that brings us all together.

and

*Artist Highlig**hts:  Liliana Alamendarez, Wanda Phipps, Kate Kirtz, Ryan
Murdock, and Gretchen Farrar*
**November 13, 2010 at 7pm

Subject:      Entropy and Books--Descriptons of Favorite Weathered Volumes and
              Texts

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It would be great to share some descriptions of the tango between your
favorite volume(s) and the environment where you are.  Japan is
notorious for its foxing frenzies--most of my books have tiny black and
brown threads colonizing the tooth of the paper and lichen-like spoors
notching away at the typographic landscapes of what I read.  I have two
notebooks form the 1980's that are crammed full of writing, scribbling
out, worthless phone numbers, torn, dog-eared and foxed pages, pages
rotting, onion skin-like, sun-burnt, spat-upon, maggot-bitten and
palimpsested with white-out and bic reworkings, rain-tortured into
rivulets of ink charging crookedly down the cheek of the page from black
to blue to gray like the tears of a miraculous icon in a sooty corner of
some yellow-walled church where nobody goes but the toothless,
squint-eyed, and terminal; books falling to pieces and stinking of
ancient sex and Lucky Strikes, and years spent in old winter coats for
sale in the bargain bins of the Purple Heart and the Salvation Army.
These are the kinds of books that excite my imagination because those
old Complete Poes and The Poems of Robert Service tortured into
ghostlier shapes, rain-warped into counterweights for mobiles and
stabiles invites my Twombly and Rothco appreciation centers to
re-activate, and these are located close to the endorphin sluices of my
innermost and most secret self and jam them open, or at least tickle the
hell out of them so that my tongue thrusts out to lick the plaster on
the wall in joy.

Your descriptions solicited!  Jess

by Jeffrey C. Robinson

Foreword by Anne Waldman

The jazz term =93riff=94 is short for =93riffle=94=97=93make rough.=94 In *=
Untam=92d Wing:
Riffs on Romantic Poetry*, scholar/poet Jeffrey Robinson sets out much like
a jazz musician to renew a great body of work (say, Miles Davis on George
Gershwin)=97=93to recast,=94 as he says in the Prefatory Note, =93what have=
 become
monuments, with all the inertness of passive appreciation that monumentalit=
y
encourages, into living forms.=94 If he =93roughs up=94 some of our long-ti=
me
favorites, it=92s not to revise, and certainly not to improve, but on the
contrary to reveal a timeless dimension that is of the very nature of the
Romantic: =93I would define a =91romantic=92 poem, of whatever vintage, as =
one
that invites its own renewal in every present.=94 With all the boldness and
subtle care of the poets he celebrates, Robinson stakes his =93life-long
involvement as reader, teacher, and scholar/critic of Romantic poetry=94 on=
 an
equally committed =93absorption and belief in the discoveries of modern and
contemporary experimental poetry.=94 Like a true marriage it lays bare both
parties.

*"Untam=92d Wing* is a heady conglomeration of poetic intensities and
re-visionings, of the Romantic mother lode. Only a poet deeply embedded in
and enthralled by this realm could take wild liberties and shape them into =
a
contemporary volume of such curious and inventive range. Jeffrey Robinson i=
s
a scholar and has lived inside the Romantic body for decades, and precisely
because of this his imagination is highly attuned to further Romantic
nuance=85. He sheds bright light on meaning and message. He is the
scientist/artist finally breaking free of shackles."
=97Anne Waldman, from the foreword

age
* (1989), *The Current of Romantic Passion* (1991), and *Reception and
Poetics in Keats: My Ended Poet* (1998). He has also engaged Romantic poetr=
y
and poetics through the genres of original lyric essays, diary, and poetry
in, for example, *Romantic Presences* (1995), *Spliced Romanticism* (1997),
and, most recently, *Wordsworth Day by Day: Reading His Work into Poetry No=
w
* (2005). He is co-editor, along with Jerome Rothenberg, of *Poems for the
Millennium, Volume Three: The **University** of **California Book** of
Romantic and Post-Romantic Poetry*. A winner of Guggenheim and NEH
fellowships, Jeffrey Robinson has taught at the University of Colorado,

Russell Williams was worried about being seen as a coldblooded psychopath.
But who could call him that? No, he looks, instead, like a warm fuzzy
psychopath. He was particularly concerned for his wife, the Canadian
military, and his cat. Which, of course, is quite um touching in a leader of
the Canadian military. Yes, a real warm and fuzzy Canadian psyschopath. Did
you ever see American Psycho? A brilliant movie of the Reagan era of
Republican psychopathy. Here we have the Canadian Psycho of Harper's Canada.
Even with the photos of him being the Queen's pilot and talking with
Harper's Defence Minister Peter what's his name, the pig.

Dear poetic friends,

When I was young, the book "Technicians of the Sacred" had a powerful
impact on me!

I thought of it immediately when I received the e-mail below from Jill
O'Mahony. =A0I met her face-to-face in Dublin recently, as I was
involved with several events for the IMRAM festival. =A0I was impressed
by her, and think it would be good to help to support her project.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for Jill, please send them to her dire=
ctly.

Please send the notice about her project to any indigenous, tribal, or
native poet you think might benefit from her activity.

Of course, a more active link between a Tribal poet and a Gaelic poet
might be a plus.

Thank you.

Best wishes,

S=E9amas Cain

Subject: Native American / Irish Compilation
To: seamascain@gmail.com


Dear Mr Cain,
Hello, my name is Jill O'Mahony. I am currently a lecturer in the
Waterford Institute of Technology and am working in the area of
Cultural Studies. I hope you don't mind my contacting you but your
email address was given to me by Gabriel Rosenstock in the hopes that
you might be interested in submitting poetry for addition to a
compilation I am editing. Below is an outline of what I hope to
achieve. I would be delighted if you would read over it and perhaps
consider contributing.
If you could get back to me whenever is convenient that would be great,
Best wishes,
Jill


It's structure will consist of a substantial introduction to the theme of
> Identity and Voice in marginalized communities, followed by two sections,
> one consisting of Irish Poetry and one on Native American poetry.
> The introduction will give the above theme consideration on its own and i=
n
> relation to the poems that follow (in addition to highlighting
> problems with efficiency in translating from the original language among =
other themes). There
> will be two sections. The first of which will be Irish language poetry al=
ongside their English translations.
>
> The second section would focus on poems written in Native American
> Languages (I am also waiting for confirmation of possible Chomorro
> submissions) with their English translation. All of this obviously within
> the specified theme of national identity within marginalized communities.
> Issues dealing with displacement of land, loss of cultural heritage (or t=
he
> fight to retain it), changing notions of identity & etc.
>
> This compilation would be a great benefit for any Sociology of Literature
> course, not to mention the obvious English Literature modules on
> Postcolonial studies. Most of all the compilation would strive to provide=
 a
> cross cultural platform on which marginalized communities can express uni=
que
> artistic talent. By combining Irish culture with Native American Culture =
in a venture like this we
> immediately reach a wider community.

The Turkish poet Arif Damar (1925-2010) died yesterday.


                                    The Broken Spool



Old friend, depart,

We climb the swings

of our silence,



apart from each other,

We swing, elbow to elbow,

stop,

then, by separate stairs,

return

to our thresholds.



It=92s evening,

We take the domesticity of evening

on our back,



In one hand the stick

on which we rest,

in the other,

disappearing daylight.





(As red in the western sky

strikes us to re-write fate,

sparks fly from our foreheads!).





It=92s evening,

We walk,

without dalliance,

We reach

the all-embracing sea,

kneeling,

We=92ll stay there.





First, we free our sweaty wrists

from the handcuffs

that old friend has fixed,

unawares =96

unaware



the sea is tired.



*And night!*

*Such night!*

*Rich night none can penetrate!*



We part-open the door

Of the weary waters =96



(In star light

We follow our light) =96



enter in

ha! *tell me about it*!



If memories aren=92t *re*activated,

*re*experienced,

they wither and fade,

discarded, abandoned...



(*what other options had we?*)



We each remain silent.


*and night*


**

*Such night*


*Rich night none can penetrate!*
**



We don=92t look to the stars

nor pay attention to the sounds,

or to the silence,

We=92re ocean-tempered.



Night=92s pleasures

wait for us,

white water lilies,

waiting to spread their scent.



We=92re the curvilinear fantasy

of the placid lake,

its honest labor,

absence of pretension.



We=92re

the water lilies=92 unheard music,

echoing depth.



Tomorrow, together,

we might save the world,



but first, tonight, please,

*may this night be over!*



 *and night*


**

*Such night*


 *Rich night none can penetrate!*


That natural

undying loveliness

blossoms on the thinnest
of criss-crossing branches.



Let=92s break off, we said,



two filaments



                         of silver cord



pendant



                         in empty space



coming down

Kaurab Translation Archive presents new English translations of Utpal Kumar
Basu -

http://www.kaurab.com/english/bengali_poetry/utpal.html

Utpal Kumar Basu is an Indian (Bengali) poet from the 1950s generation whose
work has received great attention since the birth of a Bengali postmodern
consciousness. Utpal's oeuvre is as wide and vivid as his travels. His
poetic craft is quietly iconoclastic in its deglorification of the artistic
position of the poem. At the same time, the poem carefully allows for
retention of poetic speech and valor. A world, as if seen through the eyes
of a migratory bird, where nature exists amidst its wastefulness and tribes
of lesser known ordinary people of a cultural variety, punctuate his
imagery. One critic has referred to his poetic language as "mashed" while
another describes it as "nomadic".

Jesse,
In New Mexico the glue used in bindings sometimes dries out and turns to
dust so that a book comes apart in your hands.
I have some topo maps with wonderful, meandering trails eaten into them by
insects.
A few years ago the Center for Contemporary Arts in Santa Fe did a show not
of environmentally damaged books but of library books that had been
vandalized because of their lesbian/gay content. A group of artists salvaged
them and turned them into sculptural artists' books and other kinds of
artworks. Quite moving.
Jeffrey

The technical problems that caused me to take Jerome Rothenberg's 'The Jigo=

nd the ebook is now available free at:

http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/the-jigoku-zoshi-hells-a-book-of-variatio=
ns/13227501

Description:

Jerome Rothenberg's 'The Jigoku Zoshi Hells: A Book of Variations' is a ser=
ies of new poems following the method of composition Rothenberg had previou=
sly used in "The Lorca Variations" and in homages to the work of other poet=
s and artists. In the present set he applies the same procedure to an early=
 work of his own, "The Seven Hells of the Jigoku Zoshi" (1962) =E2=80=93 no=
t to annihilate the original but to bring it into a new dimension, where bo=
th versions can lead an independent if interlinked existence. The fifty yea=
r gap between them adds its own strangeness to the mix.

INSTANT POETRY PATENTS
David Jhave Johnston
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=342
About a year ago, John Cayley made a post on NetPoetic entitled "An Edge of
Chaos". In it he delimits a constraint-based networked-writing process:
"Write into the Google search field with text delimited by quote marks until
the sequence of words is not found. Record this sequence.." A couple of
weeks ago, I woke up with the idea of making a poem composed entirely of
lines that returned no search results. "Wow", I thought to myself, "what a
great idea". I had forgotten it was John's idea...

SIGN AFTER THE X

David Clarke has created a new work of net art called Sign After the X in
collaboration with Marina Roy and Graham Meisner. Sign After the X is
structurally similar to some of Clark's earlier works such as A is for Apple
and 88 Constellations for Wittgenstein. The form of these works is one that
Clark has been developing for some time now...

All language is translation.

?Pierre Joris

The logic of language turns out to be contaminated by languages, plural.

?Jed Rasula



Barzakh is a multi-genre, biannual online journal with an
internationalist stance that presents work that enters the between of
spheres of existence. For the next issue, Barzakh seeks creative and or
critical works that address, challenge, and reshape translation
practice as an extension of this intermediary position. Questions on
translation as a discourse to consider include but are not exclusive to:

How does translation practice complicate and inform languages, plural?

Is translation a form of selection?

What are the ethics of appropriation involved with translation?

How does working on translation affect the writer?s creative work and
the way in which it is received?

Does translation necessarily have to be between two texts as
equivalences, or can it rather be translation from disparate medias?
How can say, the visual or kinesthetic be translated into text or
vice-versa?

Please send any work which delves into the between of translation
practice to barzakhmagazine@gmail.com by November 15th. Please write
?Translation? in the subject line. Barzakh can be found at
http://barzakh.net

    Over the course of her lifetime, Elizabeth Bishop translated works
by the French surrealist Max Jacob in 1950 and by the Mexican poet
Octavio Paz in the 1970s. She also translated several pieces by
Brazilian writers, such as Clarice Lispector and Carlos Drummond de
Andrade, as well as Helena Morley, a young girl who grew up in a
Brazilian mining town in the nineteenth century, whose diary she
translated.     An exacting and literal translator, she advances the
following recommendations in her unpublished Remarks on Translation:
"When a word is repeated? repeat it! (Just because English has more
words than any other language except Russian?doesn't mean we have to
use them all. . . .) When a line is repeated?repeat it?and also?stick
to the structure" (Bishop as qtd. in Henneberg).  Additionally, in a
letter to Anne Stevenson,  she writes that translations were to be
handled "with a minimum of bloodletting or seepage" (Ibid).
    Questions to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:

     How did translation influence Bishop?s development as a poet?
     In what ways did Bishop accommodate the ?otherness? of
cross-cultural translations?
     What are the ethics of Bishop?s ?literal? translations?
     In what ways do Bishop?s translations critique or complicate
imperialist themes?
     In what ways does Bishop stage her own interventions in her
translated works?

Please send any work which delves into Bishop?s translated work to
barzakh@gmail.com by November 15. Please write ?Bishop Translation? in
the subject line.

**Christopher Paul Stelling
http://www.myspace.com/freedumbmusesick

Take one look at his road-worn, weathered guitar, and you know that
Christopher Paul Stelling is a musician with a story to tell. Stelling
has revived a sense of musical storytelling and mastery over his
instrument that was thought to be long since forgotten. With a
heartfelt voice, dynamic finger-picked guitar stylings, and a
songwriting approach that combines folkloric, mythological, and
religious imagery, Stelling has forged a style that is all his own,
yet hauntingly familiar. He is a Brooklyn-based musician, hailing
originally from Daytona Beach, Florida.

Years ago I had a copy of CHAOS by James Glieck which I lent out to
someone visiting our community.  Well after the person has left I
remembered the book & wondered what had happened to it.  Didn't find
it at the time but some months later I was wandering thru our apple
orchard & found the book spread open to a 2 page color spread of chaos
fractals which at that point had been decomposed & rearranged by
numerous rains, insects & critters chewing on it.

 I was pleased to be asked by Anny Ballardini to take part in a series of i=
nterviews she's doing with poetry publishers at Fieralingue:
http://www.fieralingue.it/corner.php?pa=3Dprintpage&pid=3D3461

Excerpt:
Q: Are there any parameters by which you understand the political correctne=
ss of a literary work? Could you please describe them? Could you give some =
examples based on the books you published?
=20
A: I can=E2=80=99t really answer the question, as I don=E2=80=99t believe t=
hat poetry that thinks of itself as political is of any urgent relevance to=
 the aesthetics of poetry, which has always been my main concern. I assume =
that some of those poets who write what they call political poetry hope it =
will have some interest philosophically, if nothing else. Few would expect =
it to bring about political change.=20
The failure of the high profile and well-supported political protest song =
=E2=80=9Cmovement=E2=80=9D in the USA in the 1960s should be an indication =
that if such a popular and internationally well-publicised mass movement as=
 that failed, then certainly =E2=80=9Cpolitical=E2=80=9D poetry (avant-gard=
e or otherwise) has little hope of success.=20
Q: With the general economic crisis that has hit not only the U.S.A., what =
is your forecast on the future of the book?=20
I think the future of printed books will be that they will still be availab=
le but for mainly archival purposes, and for collectors of beautiful object=
s. There may also be a market for them as gifts for special occasions such =
as weddings, christenings and other rights of passage celebrations. But as =
a utility, printed books will be used rarely when devises such as Kindle be=
come as ubiquitous and as affordable as digital wristwatches.=20

In the last few months, Furniture Press Books has shifted directions
(slightly), savoring the exciting new methodologies in philosophical
literature. Historically, philosophy has sought to explain mythology,
describing it as an attempt to make sense of unknown realities. What
Anne Ashbaugh practices is a creative=A0work that uses mythology to
explain philosophy. In turn,=A0Mythopoiesis=A0critiques eros and psyche
from a mythological locus, breaking traditional boundaries=A0and
allowing innovativations=A0of=A0philosophizing to flourish.

_______________

from Mythopoiesis

Identity resists differentiation. Yet, exiting the interior labyrinth
and entering the exterior maze, a soul necessarily affirms other
souls. Plato called this exterior labyrinth the circular flow that
admits the presence of alterity into the boundaries of a soul. For
reason=92s desire, this flow becomes a principle: the soul promises not
to contradict itself. =A0When the creative soul promises fidelity to the
external world, alterity becomes the soul=92s fuel. In the strife, the
urge to create becomes a generator of freedoms that enables the body
to soar. Sexual intercourse incarnates this birth of differentiation.
Discourse begets intelligible offspring. Becoming a social self
entails transforming the most creative impulse within us into the
guardian of others.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Descartes=92 tragedy consists in a radica=
l confusion of
these two energies. Lust for certainty caused him to relinquish the
guardianship of self-identity to an external power: he surrendered
self-making to a transcendent god innate to the soul only as an idea.
The inverted self reverses the process of alterity. The twofold
transgression of reason=92s principles give rise to overwhelming
paradoxes: an other, a radically other, appears as an innate, interior
principle of the self. The cogito became a factory of evil geniuses.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 The monstrosity of this reversal rendered=
 Cartesian
thought pornographic. All thinkers who view Cartesian certainty desire
it erotically, without love. Like Pasiphae=92s lust for Poseidon=92s bull,
the philosophical lust for certainty resorts to artificial contortions
of the soul, language, and thought in order to captivate the Cartesian
god. Like the Minotaur, the Cartesian god must remain in the mind by
the sheer allure of the mind=92s intricate pattern. If the god decides
to exit, the cogito crumbles into illusion. To make the mind even more
appealing, Descartes divorced it from the body. The eyes might seduce
the god into complete love, into physical intercourse with the
inquirer. The mind could not witness such a betrayal. Bodies seduce
gods just as effortlessly as gods beguile the mind. Wise to this
predicament, Descartes hid the body from the god innately captured in
the mind. Unwittingly, he engendered a modern Minotaur within
rationality. Eroticized certainty burdened each human body with a
bull=92s heavy head.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Epistemologists long to feel the phallic =
jab of Poseidon=92s
bull. They too appeal to Daedalus=92 power. Reason must alter its shape
so that certainty may penetrate it. Once the practical, constructive
energies of the Daedalean power of the soul function at the service of
this task, reason becomes a wooden cow: it ceases to be exercised as a
desire and it becomes a vessel for knowledge, an empty receptacle
where love of wisdom shrivels into sheer appetite for the image of
truth. Like the speaker who divorces his words from their sound, the
epistemologists attempt to think without desiring.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Descartes=92 meditations prefigured virtu=
al sex. In an
intercourse with a god first doubted through an image of what the
cogito would become, and then fiercely acknowledged as an innate idea
of that cogito, the soul pleasures itself alone pretending to share
its thrill with another mind. The Meditations function as an
epistemological autoeroticism wherein the desire for knowledge
indulges in the look of knowledge until it reaches a mental climax
that paralyses desire. In Descartes=92 meditations, Fermat=92s theorem
becomes psychological. There are no whole numbers greater than two.
Within the self, alterity is always a proposition to the n-power.

There's a great shop in Tokyo that sells Edo and Meiji era prints and
books and many are water-stained and a bit cool to the touch with a
whiff of must about them as if they had been kept in a series of
basements from c. 1660 till the day before you see them. Indeed, some of
my favorite books have water-damaged from sudden cloud bursts and
driving (zaaa zaaa) Kyushu rains--including a Creeley Selected Poems
(nice volume) that literally bulges like a show pigeon's snowy breast
as it paces in its cage at the county fair waiting for the Judges in the
pigeon "All Show" competition to arrive and begin their joyless
evaluations.  The pages seem to resist opening, but can be coaxed apart
if jogged on the knee in the old "shoe-maker" position, to reveal the
Creeley poems that continue to fascinate me most, each marked with a
slight discoloration close to the gutter of the page, as if part of a
face were occluding the light streaming in over the left shoulder of a
"hidden" reader present each time I open the volume.

from the introduction: "When I was asked by Rattapallax editor Flavia Rocha to
curate a  selection of West Coast poets, there were several facets of this
project  that I considered a given. First, I wanted to limit the poets to the
Northwest, a region with which I am more familiar than parts south.  While
Flavia mentioned a desire for recordings of the poets reading  their own work, I
knew that I would also want to conduct interviews with  them, as I had missed
participation in that art form, something I had  extensive experience with
during my 26 years in radio. I also knew that I  would be interested in
innovative poets..."

Poets included:

C.E. Putnam Carletta Carrington Wilson Dan Raphael Emily Kendal Frey Erin Malone
John Olson Maged Zaher Mary Paynter Sherwin Paul Nelson Roberta Olson Sarah
Mangold
Thank you Rattapallax for this opportunity.

I once had a SIGNED COPY of HOTEL LAUTREAMONT stuffed in my coat pocket
as I negotiated the post-midnight streets of Milwaukee on a snowy
evening years and years ago.  I had hammered back one too many of my
favorite drinks at my next-to-favorite WATERING HOLE, and all I can
remember was singing "Full Fathom Five" from the Tempest all the way
across the Locust Street Bridge.  Well, I announced my arrival to no one
at my ratshit digs, throwing my coat in one corner and my self in the
other.  The next morning I searched my nominally furnished palace for
said volume to no avail,  Later that day, I found it about 1/4 of a mile
away face down in a pile of slush on the now sun-radiant route to my
sweetly crumbling abode.  The spine had absorbed the smell OF THE GREAT
OUTDOORS, the pages were sweating dark, clinkered water (Wisconsin road
juice) and coming apart as I turned them slowly, gingerly supporting the
volume with one gloved hand (brown), and turning, and peeling apart with
my other, gloveless, smoothly pale hand.  The back pages had assumed the
appearance of an intricate, scaling palimpsest of word layered over
sentence, sentence (almost geologically) striated, against the thicker
paper of the BACK COVER.  Indeed, the mechanical gatherings of the pages
cohered in "chunks" of text, if you will, some of which seemed to be
in the process of curling as they dried--during my prolonged
contemplation--and others seemingly drawing even more moisture from the
depths of the binding through capillary action, signaled by a
significant darkening of the page.  I leaned against a nearby wall to
turn this ARTIFACT over and over in my hands, as if I were engaged in
one of the more modern schools of SADO.  After appreciating the RUIN of
my book--which I had purchased at a not inconsiderable sum, given my
financial situation at the time--and holding it up against the
obnubilous sun to better appreciate the variety of dips, curves, and
other sculptural attributes that it had attained during the previous 15
hours or so of neglect, I thought to dig for the signature of HE WHO HAD
SIGNED THE VOLUME, and found that the inked salutations had formed a
gray-green VINE of leaf-like cursive bleeding into itself and drying
with the very application of my BREATH.  Jess

Women Who Teach Art for Social Change

Four Los Angeles women discuss how they use the knowledge and expertise of
their art to change the lives of kids and, in turn, take steps to transform
society.
Professor Chuck Rosenthal, Department of English, chair

Panelists:
Sherry Jason began studying ballet at the age of 4, and at the age of 11 sh=
e
began teaching ballet to neighborhood children for fifty cents a class in
her parent=B9s garage. Even then, it was her firm belief that classes in th=
e
Arts should be provided free for those children whose parents could not
afford to pay. Ms. Jason performed as a soloist with Ballet Concerto and ha=
s
continued her teaching for over 50 years.

Graduating from UCLA with a BA in Psychology, she received her Juris Doctor
from Southwestern University School of Law. In l975, Ms. Jason was sworn in
as a member of the State Bar of California in private ceremonies by the
Honorable Consuelo Marshall (now a member of the Federal Bench). Ms. Jason
joined the Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office Juvenile Division in
l977. It was there that she met her husband and partner of 33 years, Bob
Jason. Describing herself as an "Attorney at Law/Ballerina at Heart," Sherr=
y
and Bob Jason created Ballet for Topanga in l979, and together produce The
Topanga Nutcracker Ballet now in its 30th season. Through their experiences
in the Juvenile Justice System, Sherry and Bob formulated a philosophy on
the nature of delinquency, intervention and prevention.

In l983, the Jasons used all their savings and borrowed from friends and
family to create the Downtown Dance Studio/L.A. Fringe Theatre to be the
artistic home to our community=B9s most impoverished children. City Hearts =
was
created in l984 to provide FREE classes to Skid Row, inner city, and
at-greatest-risk children. Now celebrating 25 years, City Hearts has
provided quality Arts education to over 27,000 children.

As an advocate and instructor in the Arts arena for over 46 years, and as a=
n
attorney and defender of children's rights for over 30 years, Sherry Jason
is uniquely qualified to create, direct and implement City Hearts'
innovative programs of prevention.

Utilizing her extensive dance background, Ms. Jason choreographed a segment
on Jane Seymour's "Medicine Woman" TV series and has been interviewed
regarding City Hearts' award-winning programs by NBC Nightly News and
featured on CBS, CNN and other local and international news programs
including Oprah. City Hearts has been named to the President's Committee on
the Arts & Humanities and been honored by the Sesame Street Parents Magazin=
e
and the Children's Television Network as an inaugural recipient of the
"Sunny Days Award." In 2008, Ms. Jason helped to write the
Standards/Foundations for Dance Education for 3/4 Year Olds for the

Erin Cottrell is an award winning actress best known for her performance in
Michael Landon Jr.'s, Love Comes Softly series as well as being the new
Caroline Ingalls in Disney/ABC's Little House on the Prairie. She has had a=
n
extensive career in film and television including guest lead appearances on
E.R., CSI:NY, Cold Case, Medium, NUMB3RS, Ed, and Stranger's With Candy, as
well as reoccurring characters on All My Children and The Guiding Light. He=
r
film credits include Legally Blonde 2, Love's Abiding Joy and Faith of My
Father's, (the film based on John McCain's biography.) Most recently she wa=
s
seen alongside Jason Alexander and Christopher Lloyd in the NBC mini-series=
,
METEOR.

When Erin is not filming she is teaching. Since 2002 she has been a proud
teacher for the nonprofit organization, City Hearts: Kids Say Yes to the
Arts. She has taught jazz, hip hop, musical theatre, Shakespeare, black and
white photography and acting to the at risk youth of East LA and Oxnard,
bringing the arts into vastly under-funded areas. Her love of teaching
underprivileged youth stems from her work in London at the Young Vic
Theatre, where she was a performance intern. There she had the opportunity
to run a summer program with at risk high school students to create dramati=
c
pieces about their lives in the city. She feels fortunate to be able to be
directly involved in the lives of her students and to offer them a new kind
of self-expression and sense of confidence that they would otherwise not be
exposed to. The children that she has had the opportunity to work with have
deeply touched her life and improved her understanding of the power of the
arts more than she could have imagined.
Erin is also a member of The New Hollywood, an elite group of female
performers focused on supporting women in the arts. Each year they raise an=
d
donate thousands of dollars to charities throughout the world supporting
children in need and arts education.

at national conferences and youth facilities for more than a decade. She
holds a BS in Psychology from Delaware State University (1997), and attaine=

her PhD in Communication from the University of Michigan in 2005. Angie
received both a Kramarae Outstanding Dissertation Award from the
Organization for the Study of Communication, Language & Gender and Foote
Distinguished Dissertation Award from the Department of Communication

Black women and girls' aggression in hip hop culture, and her work, "What I=
s
This Gangstressism in Popular Culture?" appears in the anthology Next Wave
Cultures: Feminism, Subcultures, Activism by Anita Harris (2008).

The (SIS)TEM is a collective of female emcees, producers, vocalist, and Djs=
,
co-founded by Aceyalone and DVS 1, from the legendary Project Blowed in Los
Angeles. DVS 1 created and hosted a hip hop show respectively named, "Femal=
e
Perspective." Being a female emcee she saw that on the main stream, as well
as the underground, women weren't getting their just due. She decided to
organize an event show-ing off the ladies' talent. By the time she reached
the second one the roster for performers doubled. This prompted the idea to
create an album of all female emcees because apparently there was an
untouched fan base out there for it. "We never knew there were so many
hungry, motivated driven women all on the same grind". You can call it "the
female Wu-Tang". The (SIS)TEM is about 7 Core Members (all solo artists) an=
d
a host of about 15-20 affiliates, all coming together to push one goal; For
women to gain the respect they deserve on the mic. The (SIS)TEM came about
during a time when Hip Hop is starving for feminine energy. These women are
definitely filling the void with quality music.

"Dust of Gold" - Performance by Elia Arce

Elia Arce is an internationally known Costa Rican artist and cultural
activist who works in a wide variety of media, including performance,
experimental theater, film/video, spoken word and installation.

Hosted by Ruben Martinez, Fletcher Jones Chair of Literature and Writing

"Dust of Gold" is an interactive installation project for Bellarmine Forum
2010 at Loyola Marymount University based on the "Alfombras de Aserr=EDn" o=
r
street carpets of sawdust made for Easter in Guatemala, a tradition with
roots solidly in Mayan culture dating back to long before the Spanish
arrived. The colorful and fragrant use of carpets of pine needles, flowers
and other natural elements has its beginnings in the Mayan custom of
creating pathways for kings and priests to walk upon when entering
ceremonial locations and for use in sacred spaces. A ritual performance art
piece honoring the Tongva ("people of the earth") tribes that inhabited thi=
s
region before the arrival of the Europeans, will take place the last evenin=
g
of the forum. I am already consulting with Tongva leaders in order to make
sure I am respectful of their ways.
"Dust of Gold" is the result of the fusion of traditional and contemporary
art forms. This carpet welcomes the Golden Era, which starts at the end of
the Mayan calendar in Dec. 2012. And symbolically envisions the coming
together of the Mayan and Aztec nations for the future of the cosmos. The
design that I have created is based on the Mayan calendar round made up of
two cycles and the number 0. The outer ring represents 18 months of 20 days
each and 1 month of 5 days, which equals 365 days. The inner golden ring
represents 13 numbers that repeat themselves endlessly within a 20-day
cycle, represented here by the outer golden ring. And the image at the
center is the Mayan symbol for the number 0, which represents the "navel of
the world" from where the sacred tree springs: the beginning of all things.
This is where the final performance will most likely take place.

"The Purpose of Being" - Opening Reception for the LA artists/activists and
LMU collaborators

Curator Ronald Lopez from the 18th Street Arts Center and LMU Faculty
Liaisons Jane Brucker and SaeRi Cho Dobson

The exhibition participants for The Purpose of Being at Loyola Marymount
University include:

Selected LMU students led by Amitis Motevalli, Arzu Arda Kosar, Elana Mann =
+
Vera Brunner-Sung, Jane Brucker, Kristin Ross Lauterbach + Christina Lee
Storm, Ofunne Obiamiwe and SaeRi Cho Dobson.

The Purpose of Being, which will run simultaneously with Harmony
Reverberates Optimism (HRO). The HRO exhibit will be held at Jaus Gallery
(1943 S. Westgate Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90025). Each exhibit focuses on
women and their efforts to create social change through their art form. Bot=
h
exhibits exercise social criticism at its highest form through, not only
aesthetically pleasing work, but art that provokes dialogue and pushes
boundaries; art that is active and penetrates society in such a way that it
promotes itself fiercely and unapologetically. Artists involved push the
limits and blur the line between activist and artist.

The two exhibits will coexist as a dialogue with one another. Harmony
Reverberates Optimism was originally exhibited at McNish Gallery, Oxnard
College and now becomes the precursor to its evolved counter part and
"action" show, The Purpose of Being. The original exhibit will be shown in
its entirety at Jaus gallery. The intention of The Purpose of Being takes
the ideas from the Harmony show a step further as it becomes the "action" o=
f
Optimism. Each artist will "activate" selected students from Loyola
Marymount University and collaborate on new social interventions that will
lead to new discussions and art works exhibited during the Bellarmine Forum=

Kim Abeles: Art and Activism

Artist's Gallery Walkthrough; Kim Abeles

LA artist Kim Abeles mines the urban environment with a great sense of
curiosity. She incorporates both conventional and unorthodox media-from
using smog particles to quilting with trash-to explore broad social topics.
In her own artistic practice and community collaborations, she uses
metaphors and humor to bring our attention to crucial issues such as
pollution, gender roles, civil rights, and even traffic.

Abeles was born in Richmond Heights, Missouri in 1952. She received her BFA
from Ohio University and her MFA from University of California, Irvine. The
Smog Collector series brought her work to national and international
attention in the art world, and mainstream sources such as Newsweek,
National Public Radio, CBS Evening News, and The Wall Street Journal. She
continues to exhibit internationally, including recent projects in Vietnam,
Thailand, Czech Republic, England, and China. She represented the U.S. in
both the Fotografie Biennale Rotterdam and the Cultural Centre of Berchem i=
n
Antwerp.

Marick Press is pleased to announce the publication of "Elegy for Dead =
Languages," a new collection of poems by Francesco Levato. "Elegy for =
Dead Languages" features the much-acclaimed long poem "War Rug," which =
is also a cine-poem of the same title and was an Official Selection of =
the Zebra Poetry Film Festival in Berlin and an Official Selection of =
the Potenza International Film Festival.=20

REVIEWERS SAY:

"Francesco Levato's powerful documentary, 'War Rug'--like Eliot =
Weinberger's 'What I heard about Iraq' before it--detains the language =
of the perpetrators of global military aggression and redeploys it to =
indict them. =46rom J.C. Penny catalog copy to counterintelligence =
manuals and autopsy reports, War Rug is a fierce yet unfortunate =
reminder of the absolute horrors of our age." --Mark Nowak, author of =
'Coal Mountain Elementary'

In the poem "War Rug," which was published by Broadsided last June, =
Chicago poet Francesco Levato explores the reality of living under a =
constant state of emergency, referencing the Department of Homeland =
Security's color-coded advisory system in juxtaposition with other =
common crisis shorthand. "Code Blue: no breathing / no heartbeat," he =
writes. --Poets & Writers

ABOUT THE AUTHOR & BOOK:

Poet, translator, and new media artist Francesco Levato is the author of =
three books of poetry: Elegy for Dead Languages; War Rug, a book length =
documentary poem; and Marginal State. He has translated into English the =
books of Italian poets Tiziano Fratus, Creaturing, and Fabiano =
Alborghetti, The Opposite Shore. His work has been published =
internationally in journals and anthologies, both in print and online, =
including Drunken Boat, The Progressive, Versal, and many others. His =
cin&eacute;poetry has been exhibited in galleries and featured at film =
festivals in Berlin, Chicago, New York, and elsewhere.

Mairead,

It's a terribly flaw'd system, that "collectively drawn map of the=20
field." And is used rather baldly by some--such as Ron Silliman--as a=20
kind of yearly "best of" list. Resulting, through a kind of pre-op=20
sychophancy and winning cherry-picking, in a severe narrowing of the=20
field.

The open invitation by Steve Evans here is somewhat misleading, too. I=20
didn't contribute this year because--even after diligently providing=20
comment'd lists since 2003--I didn't receive the deadline reminder this=20
time around. Noticing this at the point when Evans *start'd* posting the=20
lists, I wrote to him (13 September 2010), and received no reply. In=20
the intervening year, I had, at Isola di Rifiuti, post'd Kent Johnson's=20
fine piece titled "The Question of Attention Span (At Bourdieuian=20
Angle)" with my own sharp grouse attach'd. I can only assume that=20
Evans--as I wrote him at the time--will "brook no quarrel with [his]=20
methods." That is to say, the list is less innocent than it appears:=20
criticism results in dismissal, tout court. Which is, in my book, less=20
the sign of a community service, than that of a power ploy.

That said, I'd encourage *everybody* to prepare an Attention Span list for=
=20
next year. Send Evans a note asking to be reminded in advance of the=20
August 15 deadline. And read Johnson's percipient piece:

Thanks John.  I will read Kent's article, + your attached grouse.
I don't have a big problem with Attention Span (or the attention span to
read it carefully, even on behalf of my own books).  I'm just murmuring in
public.  I searched for my publisher too, Publishing Genius (which, despite
a recent obituary<http://htmlgiant.com/mean/two-obituaries-publishing-geniu=
s-anderbo/>,
is not dead), but didn't find.  There's bound to be a generational thing
too: Attention Span sketches a community + shows its limits.

I accidentally dropped a copy of Kenneth Rexroth's Collected Longer
Poems into an old "botton" latrine-style, Japanese toilet when I lived
in Nagasaki Prefecture back in the early 90's.  Fortunately, the book
did not sink right away, but slowly listed to the side in the emerald
green antiseptic and deodorizing solution in the tank, while Kenneth's
eyes staring woefully up through the lapping green waves.  It took about
30 minutes to wrangle the volume up with a fish hook and ten feet of
nylon line borrowed from a neighboring fisherman.  The solution had dyed
the pages a delightful color, though the photograph on the cover was
relatively unchanged and continued to present that old, cunning
gentleman, in a manner that might have elicited a comment from Susan
Sontag regarding the uncanny in photography had she been standing beside
me.  The sun was barely out that day, but I deposited the book on the
back step of my one-room country "mansion" where it drew a few hopeful
flies and an ant.  Jess

This coming Sunday's Wordplay will feature the ever irrepressible Lee
Ann Brown, fresh from a reading for the Lucipo folks down in the
flatlands of in Durham, NC. The program will air at 5:00 PM via
www.ashevillefm.org, and then be available all week as a stream from
the Wordplay program page. Eventually it'll even find its way ro the
Wordplay archive where it will haunt the internet forever, or at least
until the next Great Collapse takes everything down.

Wordplay, now in its sixth season, features poets and writers of
creative prose in performance and in discussion of their work. The
third Sunday of every month, Cathy Smith Bowers, North Carolina's Poet
Laureate, joins me to feature another North Carolina poet. A catalog
of previous shows is right here:
http://naturespoetry.blogspot.com/2010/10/season-vi-begins-catalog-of-wordplay.html
They've featured Jonathan Williams, Ed Dorn, Robert Creeley, Thomas
Meyer, Lee Ann, the aforesaid Ms. Bowers, and hosts of others.

New shows not yet in the catalog are chronicled at this link, for now:
http://naturespoetry.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-shows-on-archive.html

Enjoy!

Hi all,

I'm writing to let you know that my chapbook, *Vivisection*, has just been
released by New Michigan Press. You can read all about it
here<http://www.thediagram.com/nmp/pr_weinstein.pdf>and buy a copy
here <http://www.thediagram.com/nmp/authors.html>. (You can also order
it<http://www.amazon.com/Vivisection-Eric-Weinstein/dp/1934832251/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1288382075&sr=1-1>from
Our Fearless Leader Amazon, if you're so inclined.)

At $9, it's cheaper than two Subway lunches and twice as filling! Plus it
contains 100% fewer preservatives.


Thanks in advance & all best,

Eric

of America's most influential experimental poets. Please join us for a
special, full-length performance of Leslie Scalapino's daring and
electrifying play, Flow (Winged Crocodile) / The Trains at Dixon Place.

Flow (Winged Crocodile) / The Trains travels between the left and right
sides of the brain, with appearances by a reincarnated Patty Hearst in the
1974 SLA bank heist and a green-winged creature that is part crocodile, par=
t
Michelin man and part charging rhino. The play is performed by The
Relationship, a performance group directed by Fiona Templeton that
specializes in innovative language and use of site.=A0

"For =A0myself and the cast, directing Leslie Scalapino's FLOW has been an

I dropped a copy of Jack Spicer's early poems into a glowing ash pit
without at first realizing that I had done so due to the waves of horror
and revulsion that repeatedly swept over me one early June morning in
Maryland.  The scene was a tragic one: a barn that had once housed
several dozen sheep had been burnt to the ground with the sheep still
inside--the carcasses of which, with wool pelt intact--remained
scattered among the smoking timbers.  The fire engines had just left,
but several State Troopers were still collecting evidence, and the
general consensus was that it was almost certainly arson.  I had been
reading the SPICER TEXT by flashlight, as the sun had not risen yet, but
found that the combined car headlights, flashing gumball machines atop
the cars of the troopers, and abrupt illuminations from the flash units
of the reporters' cameras (remember, this was way back in the days
before digital), not to mention the steady-state flickerings of the
charred and clinkered upper walls and fallen ceilings of the barn
provided enough ambient light that I could put away my flashlight with
no qualms about the safety of my eyesight.  Indeed, by this flickering
light, the early poems seemed to possess a strength and beauty that I
had not noticed in the amber light of my electric lit room.  I stood
with the book held loosely in my left hand (bad mistake!), when an old
college friend, whom I hadn't seen in years, chose that particular
moment to tap me on the shoulder.  I was startled from my
grief-stricken-transience-of-all-earthly-things-pose, and whirled about,
only to be greeted by the somewhat glowing teeth and silhouette of my
old friend, who quickly announced his name (WHICH SHALL NOT BE GIVEN
HERE), to preclude any further signs of panic on my part.  He was too
later, however, as the volume was spun from my grip and tumbled into the
ashes, sending a sneeze-pattern cloud of firefly-like POINTS OF
LIGHT--perhaps 1000 of them into the Republican sky!  Cheered on by the
voice of my friend, I located a stick and scraped the volume towards us,
though it had already TAKEN FIRE with an almost supernal beauty of
orange and copper-colored flames.  Finally, I could reach under the
crime-scene tape and rake the book onto the wet grass.  I stepped on the
book 20 times or so to transmogrify the magnetic flames into a drizzle
of smoke.  Then, borrowing my friend's handkerchief, I lifted the
volume into the rays of the barely risen sun to inspect the damage.  All
of the front matter had been craggily carbonized, up to about page 25
(if I recall correctly), and was missing due to the repeated application
of my steel-toed work shoe.  However, the latter half of the volume,
though partially carbonized and truncated by the action of the flames,
was still legible, though brittle, and as I attempted to read the TEXT,
noting here and there the various modifications of form (and
consequently of meaning) I could see that my fingertips and the upper
joints of my fingers, had turned black (almost to blueness) with the
charred leavings of the lower portions of the pages and binding.
Sensing the sudden change in mood of my friend from the solemnity of a
shared grief to a barely repressed hilarity bursting to be expressed in
the mutton-fragrant air, I pulled the remaining pages apart and
mentioned to my friend, how the book looked for all the world like
something to be deposited in the trash bin.  And later, after sketching
the literary remains in my journal to make sure that I had taken
sufficient notice of every part--it was.  Jess

The internal & external links are now in place for issue 19, the southern
spring 2010 issue of Otoliths <http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/>. It's a
lengthy task, & I'm a bit worn out, so I won't write any witty lines to
introduce it as I usually do, just say that looking through it as I put it
"physically" together reinforced my opinion that it's another great issue.

There should be something there for everyone, hopefully more than a few
somethings. As for me, it's after midnight on the Tropic of Capricorn, so
I'm off to bed.

Jesse: You seem to be rehearsing bits for an=20
essay or memoir, and a good one it will be.=20
Though maybe you should be more careful with your books.

At least i had the excuse in the following of=20
being out of my mind on LSD. I had been left=20
alone for what proved to be a very long night in=20
a house I'd never been in before. The room they=20
gave me had purple walls and dim light and the=20
momentos of a woman of questionable sanity. So I=20
was pretty freaked. And the only companion I had=20
was a copy of the paperback of Duncan's The=20
Opening of the Field, which I was getting to know=20
for the first time. This would be 1969, I think.=20
I couldn't put it down. Hard to read, because the=20
perspective kept changing, and the color of the=20
letters, which seemed to dance to the rhythm of=20
the verse, but it was a safer space than the dark=20
corners that I was sure were inhabited. I=20
annotated it copiously (I almost never write in=20
books), which took some determination, because=20
the pencil kept bending in my hand. I couldn't=20
put it down, which is why I had it with me, open,=20
when I got up to pee, and it slipped out of my=20
hands and into the drink. Horrified, I rescued it=20
and patted it dry as best I could. It was a=20
little rank for a while, but I still have it.=20
It's a pretty trippy book, and Duncan was known=20
to indulge, but he was more disciplined than I=20
was, and my notations, those that are legible,=20
are more yawps than commentary, with a few strange neologisms.

That was very good acid. And it occurs to me now that if I sucked the=
 pages...

Best,

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "Impressive (Big) Instant (Bang) !" by Ivan Arguelles
Description:
Meant to be read in one breath "Impressive (Big) Instant (Bang) !" requires the reader to give up any notion of syntactic coherency while at the same time adhering to the concept of narrative fluidity. We are in the single and only moment of creation, the Big Bang, when falling in love becomes the obsessive reiteration of a unique poetics, that of being obliged to surrender the Self, forging an oblivion of the skin. While the text can be read as a footnote to its immediate predecessor "Madonna Septet", it remains stubbornly on its own, an amlagam of madness and intuition about Light and its myriad fragments.
Available as a free ebook here:

ABSOLUTE BOB
translated from the French by Jennifer Moxley
Poetry, 120 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-02-5  original paperback $14
=20
bob, a brave little guy (joker, operator, sheer energy?) bops in the =
manner of a video-game through the ways a poem inhabits sense or =
nonsense, speeds or slows, slides into forms or undoes them. bob =
occupies his virtual field of action in perpetual motion, beats down =
doors, explores corridors, removes walls, strikes sparks from =
repetition, sets fire to =94the same old,=94 pulls the levers of =
creation.
     The book=92s 24 chapters remind us of film=92s 24 images per second =
=97 just as bob to French ears suggests bobine, the reel that unrolls =
them. Also of the 24 hours in the day of a man who must exhaust himself =

preconscious world where the human body and the surrounding landscape =
are fused.
