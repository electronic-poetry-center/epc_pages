I'd like to call the attention of all present to an
extraordinary (and momently to be published) biography (see
below).  [I'll also include an attachment of the same text for
easy reference.]

Edward Dorn and Tom Clark are altogether decisive presences in
my own life.  Ed was a companion when we were starting out,
unremittingly brilliant, immensely gifted (Olson speaks of his
handling of syllables as "Elizabethan"), a loner par
excellence.  Now Tom has written a deeply moving biography of
Ed's life and no one could be more compassionate or more
perceptive of his genius.

Now and again someone tells the story of the life of another in
such a way that it recovers the resonance, the manner, the fact
of that person 'as if he were here'.  This is such a book and
Tom Clark its abiding spirit.

Robert Creeley

Edward Dorn: A World of Difference
By Tom Clark

North Atlantic Books (April 2002)
$25.00

America’s poet of dissent and difference, of geography and
distance, Edward Dorn (1929-1999) grew up in rural obscurity,
Depression-era poverty and social estrangement as a dispossessed
son of the Prairie. After initiating a critical involvement with
new poetics in dialogue with his mentor Charles Olson at Black
Mountain College in the 1950s, Dorn wandered the trans-mountain
West following the variable winds of writing and casual
employment until the mid-1960s,  when a time of trial and change
resulted in the beginnings of the groundbreaking long poem
Gunslinger.

Edward Dorn was a “culture morphologist,” a poet whose central
achievement lies in his creative response, at once intuitive,
emotional and analytic, to the complex meanings of places and
the people who live upon them. His writing enacts a deep respect
for and attention to the diverse landforms of his native
country. In the work of no other American writer are the soul of
the land and the soul of the poet so inextricably linked.

In both prose and poetry Dorn’s sharp-eyed cultural critique
goes hand in hand with a tender-hearted realism. The Dorn voice,
unmistakable and evocative as the lonesome sounding of a far-off
train whistle in the night, contributes a unique note to the
literature of the second half of America’s Twentieth Century:

“Earth is my home and I love it,
as deeply when I wake and see it lit
for me, and my hapless doings,
as I do the graduating darkness
when I withdraw with the day, an abandoned man....”

This first biography by his longtime friend and fellow poet Tom
Clark—author of previous biographies of Jack Kerouac, Ted
Berrigan, Charles Olson and Robert Creeley—offers a record of
Dorn’s life and work drawing upon fresh testimony, letters and
unpublished manuscript material provided by surviving family
members.


“A poet among biographers and a biographer among poets, Clark
is, and I use the adjective with maximal intent, a beautiful
writer. What is the place of beauty in a biography? Or (the
prior question) what is the place of beauty in a life? Clark’s
work shows that he has thought about these questions,
particularly as they regard  the special shape of a writer’s
life.”

—Jack Miles,
   Los Angeles Times

On NPR's Morning Edition last week, Nina Tottenberg
said that if the Supreme Court supports Congress, it
is in effect the end of the National Public Radio
(NPR), NEA & the Public Broadcasting System (PBS).
PBS, NPR and the arts are facing major cutbacks in
funding. In spite of the
efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and
streamline their services, some government officials
believe that the funding
currently going to these programs is too large a
portion of funding for
something which is seen as not worthwhile. The only
way that our representatives can be aware of the base
of support for PBS and funding
for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard.
Please add your name to this list and forward it to
friends who believe in
what this stands for. This list will be forwarded to
the President and the Vice President of the United
States. This petition is being passed around the
Internet. Please add your name to it so that funding
can be maintained for NPR, PBS, & the NEA.
HOW TO SIGN & FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this
petition rolling. Do not reply to me. Please sign and
forward to others to sign. If you prefer not to sign,
please send to the E-mail address indicated below.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded
to several people at once to add their names to the
petition.
It won't matter if many people receive the same list
as the names are being managed. This is for anyone who
thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of
$1.12/year of their taxes, a petition follows. If you
sign,
please forward on to others. If not please don't kill
it - send it to the
Email address listed here:
wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu
<mailto:wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu>
If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc.,
signer of this petition,

<mailto:wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu> &
wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu
<mailto:wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu> This way we can
keep track of the lists and Organize them.
NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT (highlight) the
entirety of this
letter and then COPY it into a new outgoing message,
rather than simply forwarding it. In your new outgoing
message, add your name to the bottom of the list,

out here in Tucson, we're trying to put together a proposal (grant proposal)
to bring Jayne Cortes & her band for a performance. (POG would co-sponsor w
Tucson Poetry Festival & U of Arizona Poetry Center.)

does anyone know:

--whether they perform/travel on a pretty regular basis?

--are at all likely to want to come to Tucson if the price is right?

--how much they might charge for honorarium?

--how many people are in the band (how many hotel beds do we need, etc)?

--do they have an agent we should contact?

thanks for any help,

extend an invitation for you to drop by to browse and comment. Right now
we are working with several authors to publish a series of chapbooks and
are not reading new material at this time - look for a call for
submissions in late spring.

In the meantime we're pretty proud of what we've got up there and are

David,

I took a look at your poems in Painting Without Numbers and the first issue
of your 'zine where you have some works of your own, and I enjoyed them very
much.  I liked the made-up words and syntax, the juxtaposition of phrases
that apparently didn't go together etc.  This is the kind of device use in
Language poetry as you are no doubt aware, but Language poetry also (again
as you know quite well) is associated with being highly academic and upper
class.  I think this is silly, and that anyone should be able/allowed to
write whatever style of poetry they feel like writing.

I did not find anything particularly working class about your poetry except
for the subject matter of one poem about your father in which you talk about
him getting seven pounds and frozen bones (or something like that).  I don't
see why you should be obligated, though, to sound working class, either,
unless you are a political poet who wants to agitate for the rights of the
working class, but to me you seem more like a poet who wants simply to write
poetry of a certain literary caliber that people will enjoy reading.  And I
also don't see why working class readers should necessarily either be your
audience or , if they are your audience, why they should prefer simplistic
jingoism.  Perhaps more working class people than upper class people like
simple kinds of writing since they are not as educated, but a working class
person who picks up a book of poetry is likely to want to read poetry, just
as you, a working class poet, want to write poetry and not jingles.

This is an interesting topic but also one I feel twitchy about. I am most
definitely working-class, that is to say, not just born working-class but
remaining so. I do not write to the stereotypes of how working-class poets
should write. [....]

That people on this list might be uncomfortable with the idea of
working-class poets doesn't surprise me, I'm afraid to say, it's much the
same elsewhere. Those who are supposed to be silent shouldn't start
speaking, should they?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

A brief response "off the cuff" so to speak. I've read Bernstein's
book/essay but not Longinus.  Dickinson's poetry is obviously quite unique
in that it succeeds with a radical artifice (which  - or "Poetic Artifice"
is Veronica Forrest-Thomson's book he talks about - is the title of
Perloff's book) to enter into "areas" that one could say eg Williams C
Williams  (on the face of it in his poetics) avoids: we are "deceived" into
a more abstract world and become abstracted or absorbed somewhat by
Dickinson's conceptions or our response to them: I've always found Dickinson
difficult to get my head around. Poe hypnotises or draws the reader in into
strange worlds: his famous poem about the crow finds itself in "Last Exit to
Brooklyn" which I found a strangely apocalyptic, almost biblically or
(sublimely) powerful novel: with passages of harsh "realism" juxtaposed with
biblical quotes: the poem is in itself a hint almost of the nihilist
potential in "abstract" language (although that term is problematic)...it
links I suppose back to the Romantics eg the sublime is seen clearly with
Wordsworth (  and in the extremes of Coleridge's "big" poems and his more
"intimate" or "inner" contemplative: less "absorbing" poems) and in the art
of Turner and even Constable: Wordsworth though is also trying in many poems
to tackle the reality of country life (or life itself) in ways not
normatively associated with "romanticism" or the sublime: the poem about the
leech gatherers is one, and his poem set on Westminster bridge sees the
sublime in the city: in nature often there is a threat or a darkness as eg
in "Nutting" or the incident in "The Prelude" in which he suddenly becomes
aware of the dark, threatening nature of  the external world: of course the
point is that this is all from the mediation of WW himself as with Williams
almost - dare I say it - Wordsworthian - (first poem of) "Spring and All"
... here Williams's detail is very intense but then  "dazed spring
approaches" the abstract force enters... the absorption antiabsorption
metaphor or method of thinking about poetry is very good. What I like about
that essay/poem "A Poetics" is that we dont feel (too much) that we are
being lectured to: although of course there is no discourse per se.
 But certainly "A Poetics" opens up te debate so to speak and includes
writers not so commonly thought of as being radically disjunctive.even
Swinburne, commonly thought of as melifluous and "musical" so that we can
become absorbed into his works (which in some lights might be seen as
"sublime") is "looked at" and in his biog by Jean Overton Fuller she shows
his very strong concentration on details noticed at sea, the anti absorptive
details (details that Hopkins was fascinated by ... but then he invented the
concept of inscape: Scroggins in his book on Zukofsky concentrates on the
"sound"/musicality in Swinburne but there is more to him: and as he
indicates the greatness of Zukofsky's "A" is that it  moves between
"sublime" passages (whose theme maybe for example - his own coming demise
and the harmony and honor of his own family (A11): or some "saw-horses" that
enter into a kind of dance (according to Ahearn: in one section)...then we
encounter "intrusions" such  as his son's letters or something about local
events or politics:mundanity alternates somwhat with sublimity....the
'worry' with Z being the near-obsessive intaglio of numerical and
etymylogical significations hidden under the surface of his work which leave
the reader ultimately needing to read the poem _only_ the old problems of
"difficulty" and so on...: but the anti absorptive aspects bring us to
connections while we are aware of the project and also in 'the back of our
minds' the overall  "fugal" or linear musicality of the work: as a poem or
work approaches the upper limit of music it becomes -  a transcendent - an
organ greatness - but we cant stay there as in Dickinson's projected concept
of being the thing. Or can we? Is the world too much with us? Richard.

michael, really liked your post and agree with those who say that
economic class is a trickier construction than most will grant...

as a friendly amendment:  i wonder if we might note, too, the
(negative) reception of work that isn't viewed (by said "working
class" poets, e.g.) as appropriately representational... i.e.,
similar to the sort of resistance someone like gayle jones was
subject to for ~eva's man~---its presumed failure to address african
american realities with sufficient urgency/immediacy... this is
something i've noted all too often among "working class" poets who
are after the "authentic" experience (ditto for viet nam poets who
are after the "authentic" experience)... which strikes me as
something of the same reservation some slam poets espouse when
talking about what they call "academic" poetry (and vice versa, if
you will---here the question of (aural) presence or its telos looms
large)...

so that we end up with the many uses to which the work is put, yes
(and imagined to be put, yes)... as opposed simply to a formal
classification of said work on the basis of presumptions concerning
its point of (generative) origin, or its formal attributes... or to
say it another way:  all of these aspects present us with a more
complex grasp of what's going on when we designate
poetry/literature/art with terms such as "working class"... as in,
class at work...

best,

joe

This idea of absorption is inseparable from its anti.  They both operate in
texts to form a reading, I belive Bernstein says more as colourings than
literal poles (haven't read the essay recently so I'm straining the brain
here!).

Longinus' sublimity was a form of ekstasis, being rapt, taken out of the
body.  Which is different than absorption though they share features, i.e.
(w)raptness, engulfment.

As far as Edmund Burke is concerned with relating to text, the sublime is a
feeling experienced from a distance, because the security is essential to
allowing for the (W)rapture--  you feel the terror without being in the
situation-- so I can see how this plays around near anti/absorption, however
it feels necessarily different.  Absorptive and antiabsorptive techniques
could be used to generate a feeling of sublimity, but don't have to.

I don't think a person has to be distanced from anything to affect it.
Whether we know it or not, our actions constantly affect things all around
us, our words, our decisions.  so, in a sense being enraptured can still
have an affect, sometimes a very negative or powerful affect-- imagine
someone freezing up while their friend is being mugged for example instead
of helping (bad example maybe...  though relevant these days).  Even the act
of observing/perceiving a la Heisenberg flavours what is being
observed/perceived no matter what a person's claim to objective distance.
Impotence definitely carries an affect...

THE LAUNCH OF WWW.ALLENGINSBERG.ORG
The Allen Ginsberg Trust of New York, with the development firm dataWonk,
Inc. of San Francisco, announce the launch of www.allenginsberg.org. "One of
Ginsberg's highest callings was to teach and the Web as a medium offers
unprecedented ability to disseminate and impart," says Trust director Bob
Rosenthal.

At the heart of the site are two exciting features: The Lifeline, a
choronology of important events about Ginsberg and the Beats, and the
Library, a repository intended for research that includes manuscripts, text,
audio and video clips, photographs and art works. The Library is intended to
grow substantially over time to include thousands of items, "so that those
wishing to research Ginsberg's life and work would experience as little
misinterpretation as possible."

        Dear Madison,

        Good to see you have risen from the grave to comment on this fine piece.
But are you really one to critically comment on the absorption of the
reader??? I have seen your work and quote from  After Rain


What is the spice that haunts each glen and glade?
A Dryad's lips, who slumbers in the shade?
A Faun, who lets the heavy ivy-wreath
Slip to his thigh as, reaching up, he pulls
The chestnut blossoms in whole bosomfuls?
A sylvan Spirit, whose sweet mouth doth breathe
Her viewless presence near us, unafraid?
Or troops of ghosts of blooms, that whitely wade
The brook? whose wisdom knows no other song
Than that the bird sings where it builds beneath
The wild-rose and sits singing all day long.

Madison Cawein. 1865-1914

Subject: bernstein's absorption

Reading Charles Bernstein's poem "Artifice of Absorption," I was struck by a
resemblance between his term "absorption' and the Sublime. To pick just one
point (and one version of Sublime), Bernstein writes

By absorption I mean engrossing, engulfing
completely engaging, arresting attention, reverie,
attention intensification, rhapsodic, spellbinding,
mesmerizing, hypnotic, total, riveting,
enthrallic: belief, conviction, silence

which to me serves as an introduction to his passages on Poe and Dickinson
which jibe with a remark in Longinus (chapter 7) that "by some innate power
the true sublime lifts our souls; we are filled with a proud exaltation and
a sense of vaulting joy, just as though we had ourselves produced what we
had heard." Heard, received - hearing/seeing, receptivity. Bernstein remarks
that

... In Poe's
fiction, horror is a means not only of absorbing
the reader in the tale but also, explicitly,
obliterating the self-consciousness of the story's
characters, who commonly fall into states of
absolutely rapt presentness, or rapture, or terror,
or reverie.

Bernstein then goes on to quote Dickinson's "I would not paint - a picture-"
as a "radically absorptive poetic" and writes

Not to describe or incant but to be
the thing described, "endued" - endowed - "Baloon";
to be inside, lighter than, "things,"
inflated by them, so absolutely absorbed as to be
floating "Enamored - impotent - content"; for
such enrapturement leaves one impotent to affect
the world, since to be able to affect requires
that one is removed from; & this armless
connection not only leaves one content but also, & the
double sense is crucial to the metaphysics
of the poem, makes one CONtent, thinged - bolts
one to the other side of the see/seen divide.
Yet to be able to be absorbed into this other side
requires jolts, an antiabsorptive disruption
of complacent pictoral "talk." So to "stun" is
to shock into one's senses, an ecstatic,
perhaps mystical, transport into what Howe calls
the "thrilling anonymity" of Dickinson's poetics.
Author disappears & by this act "licenses"
the "luxury" of a deeper absorption, by the reader,
in the poem than otherwise imaginable.

There are other correspondences between Bernstein's absorption and
Longinus's Sublime (which engulfs, as the Sublime is wont to do, the Burkean
and Kantian Sublimes).

        After re-reading and realize that the sublime was all the rage in your day,
and far removed today, that you may be right in some respects. I'm just more
amazed that the beyond has email access. Hey if you see Ezra Pound please
pass on my email. I have a few questions.

              blue-grey clouds
                   warm lull
            a spot of sun
   in this clearing
               of moment transferred—

           then smooth layers exhale—
   Don't let yourself get away
                   from that conversational
                tone line of  the reef emerging
            low tide, windless
                                              February 2, 1996

She’s one of our hidden treasures — the poet who really links the Beats, the
Spicer Circle, the Bolinas poets, the New York School, and the Language
poets, and the only poet who can be said to do all of the above.
—       Ron Silliman


Our literary histories of the last quarter of the twentieth century were all
written far too soon — in fact, before the period had even been lived. When
this history is finally rewritten, as it will have to be, Joanne Kyger will
assume a central place. She is one of the finest practioners of the art of
poetry conceived (after Whitman and Williams, among others) as the
preservation of experience in language. The scale of Kyger’s poetry is human
existence; spoken language provides its measure; the animating force is
curiosity. Out of these materials she has accomplished something magnificent
and beautiful. She has many peers but no betters.

                                                — Ben Friedlander


In stressing the self as a phenomenon, as appearing, being there - Joanne
Kyger's work encourages one to move beyond the tendency to see two types of
poets (women and men), which in feminist scholarship has produced a
particular, unfavorable model of literary productions. Her work encourages
one to see women writers as gesturing outward - in the same generous sense
that Charles Olson saw Robert Creeley as a "figure of outward." This
«Jacket» feature ventures in that direction with an array of critical
readings, none of them particularly attuned to gender but all of them
responsive to the powerful insistence of Joanne Kyger's cultivated line and
ear, and the graceful persistence of a continually evolving poetic, one that
lets the self go through listening to what's there - from the intimate
notebook page and the company it keeps to larger temporalities and
geographies - to create a self, broad and sweeping.

—       Linda Russo

from JOANNE

"JOANNE is a novel from the inside out."

what I wanted to say
  was in the broad
sweeping
form of being there

 I am walking up the path
  I come home and wash my hair
 I am bereft
  I dissolve quickly

I am everybody

reprinted from Joanne, Angel Hair, 1970

a question, on behalf of an Australian zen teacher who's also an
experimental musician & writer:

he's interested in publishing a CD version of stuff he's doing that combines
his music & some short prose texts he's written.  He's got some kind of big
grant for his music, so he's pretty well established in that area, I think;
probably less known as a writer.

anyway: any ideas about presses that might consider this sort of project?  I
know Hard Press did at least one CD version of a book, but I guess they're
no longer active.

thanks for any leads,

best,

Hi All,

Below is Glen Helfand's article on literary web publishing, which
appears on SF Gate, the SF Chronicle's online site.  I'm quoted in
it, to my horror, saying "stuff" three times in one paragraph.  Oh
well.

The Literary Web/Web sites featuring the word are thriving
Glen Helfand, Special to SF Gate

In the fickle world of the Web, it's nice to know there are sites that are
resistant to shifts in fashion and economy. Literary Web sites, for
example, traffic in a form that moves at a less frenetic pace than other
online media does. Communities of writers, especially those poets,
spoken-word artists and experimental-prose writers whose works rarely make
it to the shelves at Barnes and Noble, or even into the farther reaches of
Amazon.com's warehouses, have made effective and enduring use of literary
webzines -- and they may barely have noticed the fallout of the technology
crash.

    For a publishing cottage industry of small, independent presses and
copy-machine poetry rags that, in pre-Internet days, were by necessity
limited to three-figure circulation, the advent of the Web has made the
prospect of distributing new, difficult, highbrow or edgy pieces of
writing cheap and globally accessible. As one poet jests, "When those
poems go live, everybody and their mother will be reading them."

    To scratch the surface of this international online subculture is to
reveal a surprising number of publications that are well edited, inventive
and sometimes even spiffily designed literary showcases. I polled poet and
writer friends and was quickly directed to a thriving arena of journals,
resource portals and hybrids of art, writing, news and other types of
information.

    Almost everyone I contacted pointed me to Jacket, an Australian site
that's perhaps as close to a traditional print poetry journal as can be
created online. The site, which publishes a new issue roughly every two
months, includes themed sections -- the latest issue features an all-star
tribute to luminary Kenneth Koch -- reviews, poems and substantial
scholarly papers; see Marjorie Perloff's article on "Translatability in
Wittgenstein, Duchamp and Jacques Roubaud" in issue 14.

    Published by an office of one -- Sydney-based poet John Tranter, who
claims to run this hefty enterprise for $1,000 a year -- the journal is
very well organized (contents have been plotted out through December 2002)
and are posted piece by piece. This is labor-of-love territory, with
publisher/editors operating their sites on miniscule budgets or
occasionally with the support of foundations or academia, but Tranter
boasts in an e-mail that since the publication's debut in October 1997,
the site has attracted over a third of a million visits, making Jacket one
of the most widely read poetry magazines of all time.

    Numbers, however, are relative in the poetry world. "Sappho, Callimachus,
Catullus, Li Bai and John Donne all had small audiences for their poetry,"
Tranter writes in a why-I-do-it essay called "The Left Hand of
Capitalism." "And any serious poetry faces the same situation today --
it's not a profitable market anywhere in the world."

    There are hungry international consumers, though, and this method of
distribution seems to reach them more effectively than the bookstore
circuit does. Tranter writes, "In the first issue of Jacket, I published
an interview I had recorded with the British poet Roy Fisher, and received
an enthusiastic e-mail from a fan. The fellow was grateful for the chance
to read an interview with his favorite poet, he said, and went on to
explain, 'It's hard to find material on Roy Fisher up here in Nome,
Alaska.'"

    The location of the publishing house, as is usually the case with Web
endeavors, can be irrelevant. Frigate, a review of books and other
literary pursuits that appears, based on its masthead, to have a large
staff, boasts a sense of internationalism, with a current issue devoted to
"The Anglophone Transpacific." In fact, the publication is a concerted
effort by editors and contributors from geographically diverse desks.
Patricia Eakins, in an e-mail from New York, explains that she has editors
in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Massachusetts and France. The cobbling
together of an issue, she adds, takes place entirely through online
communication.

    "Creating the site has been a exhilarating, exhausting and eye opening,"
Eakins admits. "It is amazing what one person sitting at a computer can
do! People often think that Frigate must have a 'real' office with
cubicles and watercoolers and the like. Instead, it is all in the air."

    "I see these zines as an outgrowth of the mimeo revolution of the 60s,"
says Bill Berkson, a poet and critic and a professor of liberal arts at
the San Francisco Art Institute. As a young New York poet during the 1950s
Frank O'Hara period, Berkson has witnessed first-hand the publishing
evolution. "We used to have collating parties, assembling the things," he
adds. "The webzine thing isn't as sociable; there's less face-to-face
time. But that's the way it is in the electronic age -- quick and
inexpensive communication is key."

    San Francisco-based writers Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian edit and
distribute 200 copies of a mimeo-style publication called Mirage. While
they have no plans to digitize their very limited-edition publication --
Bellamy playfully calls this idea a "rumor" -- they appreciate the
electronic form.

    "I think there's a lot of high-quality stuff out there," Bellamy says. Her
own experimental prose has appeared on numerous Web sites, including
Mark(s) and Stretcher (an arts and culture site I had a hand in founding).
"It's a good venue for experimental-writing communities, because there's
no cash economy for that kind of stuff anyway," Bellamy adds. "The
publications come out more often and have more universal distribution --
you announce on a listserv, and you get people all over the world reading
your stuff."

    Another site with decent numbers, though one with a radically different
editorial viewpoint, is the online version of the Dave Eggers brainchild
McSweeney's -- a compendium of articles, fiction, essays and literary news
snippets of interest to youthful literati -- which logs 20,000 unique hits
a day. Granted, the site, which has offbeat offerings like the
smarty-pants "Readers' Interesting Experiences While Buying, Reading or
Traveling with the Print Version," has an audience that's bolstered by the
notoriety of a well-regarded and high-concept print publication, but the
Web site has different content, and it's available for free. What does it
do that its print counterpart can't?

    "Well, for one thing, the site can publish more pieces than in the print
version," explains online editor Paul Maliszewski. "We publish more than
five pieces a week, things like the letters from Elizabeth Miller's dad,
who fights fires by helicopter, or Jeff Johnson's football picks, which
Yahoo! named as one of the best things on the Internet in 2001. We
published some really strong nonfiction relating to the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Even with our fairly short production
schedule, it would have taken a couple of months for those pieces to
appear in a print issue."

    Jacket and McSweeney's are visually and philosophically all about the
text, and they're purposefully clean and simple in design in order to aid
Web-page load times. In this way, they resemble the print versions of
poetry and lit publications that are simply designed due to the
prohibitive costs of high-quality color printing. The Web, however, offers
the opportunity to affordably illustrate with full-color art, a prospect
that can foster an exciting dialog or interplay between writers and
artists. Or at least add a little spice to the page.

    Low Blue Flame is a Memphis-based site that ingeniously creates an
interplay between image, text and playful conceits. Visually appealing and
easy to load, the third issue is visually cohesive, with colorful,
surrealistic Dick-and-Jane collage motifs and texts generated with
inventive tropes -- in one case, writers such as Mark Ewart, Eileen Myles,
Bruce Benderson were asked to write text to accompany pages from a vintage
Wild West-themed coloring book.

    A section called Deep Thoughts pairs person-on-the-street snapshots with
answers to the question, "What were you thinking just now?" The responses
are short, sometimes poetic, sometimes banal. Even the interview format is
given a twist here -- the aforementioned Kevin Killian is a featured
interview subject, and his passion for celebrities is addressed by letting
him lob back trenchant quips when he is tossed the names of movie and pop
stars: "Leo DiCaprio: I thought he was retarded in 'What's Eating Gilbert
Grape?'"

    The site is organized by novelist Brian Pera (whose book "Troublemaker" is
just out in paperback), who is interested in addressing the Web's
strengths and weaknesses. "I'm not convinced that people really read on
the Web," he says. "People look at things online in a scattershot manner.
I'm trying to create a mix of elements that won't extinguish someone's
attention span. I think of it less as something people read in its
entirety than as a teaser to make people want to read more."

    Things get more technologically complex at Arras, a portal-like site that
links to a number of splashy Web sites that explore notions of text. There
are links, for example, to a theory-heavy but graphically sharp piece
called "New Digital Emblems" and something called The Pornolizer, which
inserts nasty language into any Web site you care to submit.

    A larger number of sites, however, are more humble, community-building
affairs. San Francisco-based poet Del Ray Cross started (Shampoo just two
years ago as a way to keep up with poet friends in Boston. (He will
celebrate its anniversary and 10th issue with a reading on March 1.) Cross
has seen submissions to his site, which features poetry and a smattering
of art in each issue, grow continuously. It's an ad-free, open-submission
deal in which poets are encouraged, in a large-font link, to submit their
work on the homepage. "It's really taken off," he says. "I get a lot of
submissions now, and it's becoming more difficult to find time to do the
site and be a writer."

    The interactive nature of Web sites allows for easy communication and
ready access to a vast pool of material. Whereas many print poetry
journals charge writers an income-generating fee to consider their poetry,
many sites rely on online submissions.

    "Every now and then, I'll solicit a piece of writing from someone I know,
which basically means I hear that they have a story and I ask them to
write it down," admits McSweeney's online editor Paul Maliszewski.
"Usually, there's a phone call involved, some arm-twisting and not a
little begging. But 90 percent or more of what we publish arrives first as
unsolicited submissions from readers."

    Shampoo editor Del Ray Cross basically selects whatever submitted work he
likes, and he tends to like work that's somewhat playful, and tends to mix
more established poets with unknowns. One would surmise, however, that
with an open call for work and the ease of e-mail, he receives quite a bit
of junk. "I'm getting more bad stuff," Cross concurs, "but getting a lot
more submissions -- these days, around 25 poems a week." He admits,
however, that at least half of the submissions are rejected. "I try to
appreciate something in whatever I get," Cross says. "A lot of other
magazines are stricter in genre of what they publish. I like to have a
mix."

    He adds, "I published a poem in this issue by my cat."

    The free-and-easy tone of these online publications, however, may tilt a
bit too much toward the free side for some. Because webzines are a new
arena for writers and editors, their legitimacy is not yet established.
And like other Internet interactions, practitioners often have a sense of
ambivalence.

    A number of writers say that when a piece appears online, publishers are
less likely to consider the work for print publications. Others point out
that some literary grant-giving organizations have inconsistent policies
when it comes to recognizing a webzine as a valid citation. While these
issues pose a dilemma, most writers opt for getting their work out in the
world.

    Most of the writers and readers I contacted for this story, however,
qualified their response by saying that although Web access is an amazing,
democratizing thing, the printed page is still their first choice as a
reading format. Still, the e-zines have become too valuable and
resourceful a component in the literary universe to live without. So, if
and when the fickle Web economy hits another bump, these sites will most
likely still be comfortably curled up with something good to read.

I think that "I think, therefore..." got us into a lot of false thinking.
But now even "hard science" is changing slowly - there's an article in _Gut_
last year sometime called "I'm pink, therefore I am" that basically
establishes the scientific evidence for gut feelings. Maybe it depends on
where someone thinks their "I" is?

Joe,
     I can see what komninos notes in the USCentered focus of poetry folk
here in the good old - but I do think Loss is much more aware of life
outside the continental than most.  I would, however, welcome more input
here from you on the gap you note.

Sad news: John Wieners died yesterday, 1 March 2002 in Boston. He was
hospitalized about a week ago when he was found unconscious some time after
leaving a party. The cause of death was a brain aneurysm. Wieners was one of
the great lyric voices -- with all the psychic cracks & sufferings such a
stance entails -- of the second half of the past century.

        Here is his bio note from the "Selected Poems 1958-1984" volume (Black
Sparrow Press, 1986):

        JOHN WIENERS was born in Milton, Mass, in 1934 and received his A.B. from
Boston College in 1954. He studied at Black Mountain College under Charles
Olson and Robert Duncan from 1955 to 1956. He returned to Boston where he
brought out three issues of a literary magazine, Measure, over the next
several years. From 1958 to 1960 he lived in San Francisco, and was an
active participant in the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance movement. He
returned to Boston in 1960, and divided his time between there and New York
City, over the next five years. In 1965 he enrolled in the Graduate Program
of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and worked as a teaching
fellow. He has worked as an actor and stage manager at the Poet's Theatre,
Cambridge, and has had three of his plays performed at the Judson Poet's
Theater, N.Y. Since 1970 he has lived and worked in Boston, where he has
been active in publishing and education cooperatives, political action
committees, and the gay liberation movement.

        And here is a poem from his 1964 book _Ace of Pentacles_:

An Anniversary of Death

He too must with me wash his body, though
at far distant time and over endless space
take the cloth unto his loins and on his face
engage in the self same rising as I do now.

A cigarette lit upon his lips; would they were mine
and by this present moon swear his allegiance.
If he ever looks up, see the clouds and breeches
in the sky, and by the stars, lend his eyes shine.

What do I care for miles? or rows of friends lined
up in groups? blue songs, the light's bright glare.
Once he was there, now he is not; I search the empty air
the candle feeds upon, and my eyes, my heart's gone blind

to love and all he was capable of, the sweet patience
when he put his lips to places I cannot name
because they are not now the same
sun shines and larks break forth from winter branches.

There is an audio file of John Wieners reading "A poem for Painters" from
The Hotel Wentley Poems (1958) at Joel Kuszai's Factory School site. The
sound starts out pretty shaky, but the reading of "A poem for Painters"
brings out all that is great in Wieners ... all that is already acutely
missed, even in these few hours since his death.

from "A poem for Painters"

[6]
...
This nation is so large, like
our hands, our love it lives
with no lover, looking only
for the beloved, back home
into the heart, New York,
New England, Vermont green
mountains, and Massachusetts
my city, Boston and the sea.
Again to smell what this calm
ocean cannot tell us. The seasons.
Only the heart remembers
and records them in the words
of works
we lay down for those men
who come to them.


7.

At last. I come to the last defense.

Note
My poems contain no
                     wilde beast, no
lady of the lake no music
of the spheres, or organ chants,

yet I know by these lines
I betray what  little given me.

One needs no defense.
Only the record of a man's
struggle to stay with
what is his own, what
lies within him to do.

Without which is nothing,
And I come to this,
knowing the waste, leaving

the rest up to love
and its twisted faces
my hands claw out at
only to draw back from the
blood already running there.

Oh come back, whatever heart
you are left. It is my life
you save.

The beauty of men never disappears
But drives a blue car through the
                                  stars.

                        --John Wieners

Will miss him terribly. And I never met him. But he was with me through
decades and what he was entered and informed me in ways I will never
be fully able to account for or repay. "He's gone and taken / my
morphine with him / _Oh Johnny._ Women in / the night moan yr. name"


from "A Series" (in _Ace of Pentacles_):

  5.3

Rain today and rain in the self. Reign. Return
to the place of imprisonment. Reign of life, how many
years left to bury the old heart and give birth to the new?
Reign of years, with each day a marking place of what
happens in the universe, what comes into ken,
of the stars and their turning. What one does not know.
Will never know. The desire to pierce space and
be up on the moon. Doomed as fellow men to
walk this place with sweat on our forehead.
     That we are not given enough, must find
the means to fulfill our existence. That we are
given enough, too much as a distraction to pene-
trate the essential core of our being. And what is
that but a hollow place? No radiant outpouring
as stars of light. We have eaten away our basic
substance, fed it to the drugs, of days
when there was nothing to do. Too many on the calendar.
     And yet this is substance, this despair.
     To walk with it as a beloved companion, or
friend. See that as the broken leg we try to mend.
Cripples with no crutch, looking for the broken tree
to fashion into a stump.
     And yet this is not the true condition. There
are comedies and comedians. Flowers in blossom.
The same old dirge. Age-old. The curse of
"Adam" that each man is heir to, and equipped
for--interrupted by the doctor coming down the
hall--that each man is heir, and for which each
is equipped.

Bob Creeley just asked me to send you the URL to a quick In Memoriam John
Wieners page I put up this morning...

http://tomraworth.com/wieners.html

It simply has the dates, a picture, and the note extracted from an e-mail
from Bob early this morning:


>There had been a party last Sunday on Beacon Hill somewhere, small
> number, and John had enjoyed it -- then decided to walk back to his place,
> had some sort of seizure on the way, got as far as a parking garage, and they
> called and got him to Mass General where he was for some days sans
> identification.  But something on his person got them his address, and so
> they finally connected with Jim Dunn (who called) and Charlie Shiveley, both
> of whom got to hospital in time to see John got last rites.  I think that all
> happened yesterday.  Jim said fact of John's being the few days in hospital
> sans anyone's knowing were hard to think of -- but they did get there, and he
> died with friends there -- and god willing had little consciousness beyond
> fact of walking home after pleasant evening.

This is bogus and has been circulating for more than 5 years.

Like most e-petitions it just wastes effort, time and server space,
for several reasons, not least being that the e-mail address to which
you're supposed to send petitions to has been closed down for years.

well tom, here's a quick but no less, for that, instructive [wink]
example:  have a look at ~computers and composition~ 9.2 (april
1992)---that's a decade ago---michael joyce's essay "new teaching:
toward a pedagogy for a new cosmology"... this was back when joyce
taught at jackson community college---some of you must surely recall
his work stemming from said location (?)---and his essay attempts to
provide a conceptual locus for discussing his use of computers to
teach writing to "developmental" writing students...

note his citations, among which:  bernstein (~content's dream~),
bolter (~writing space~), eco, olson, gibson, mcluhan, AND bruner
(~actual minds, possible worlds~) AND selfe ("an open letter to
computer colleagues") AND guyer & petry (from their ~writing on the
edge~ notes to ~izme pass~---the latter a somewhat important moment
in e-writing, as that issue of ~woe~ was one of the first to include
a diskette)...

delete from joyce's ruminations his contextual-institutional
backdrop---the writing classroom---and you dispense with much of the
urgency, and sheer reach, he brings to that piece of writing (which
some may find, in retrospect, somewhat optimistic, but which surely
participates in that early sense of liberation many of us experienced
online)... note his last para (the first line of which repeats the
first line of the essay):

"We face a new world when we teach.  Like the electronic character on
the screen, we too must form ourselves anew.  The new cosmology is
contoured in reciprocal relationship by the contours of we who move
within it, as participants rather than as performing spectators, as
colearners and teachers.  In such a tracery, we will make new as we
make do and truly come to know ourselves in lightform."

difficult for me to read the latter in any but a teaching-learning
light(form!), one that extends, quite literally, olson's figure of
the "archeologist of morning" (those familiar with joyce's writings
will note his steady reworking of many of olson's formulations)... in
fact the liberatory moment of emedia evinced here parallels the sort
of liberatory teaching rhetoric one finds in the 60s---and whatever
its limitations, i find it instructive in its emphasis on the student
as much as on the teacher (there is another historical thread i might
elucidate here, having to do with the inception of "critical
pedagogies"---but this would take us someplace i'm not sure we need
to go)... which teaching-learning matrix [cough] has of course been
one focus right along of computers and writing conferences, as well
as the computers and writing contingents at 4c's conferences...

but then, we're something of a far cry even here from a discussion of
how to classify  (let's say) digital poetics, no?... again, i don't
wish to discount the latter, but i do hope to situate the pertinent
history with an eye toward (broadly) computers and writing... the
journal ~computers and composition~ will be celebrating its 20th
(20th) anniversary next year with two special issues (one next year
that will include, among other things, some poetry from yours
truly---how's that for a plug?) so i would find it a bit odd were
that discourse, which continually returns to questions of
postsecondary instruction, to be excluded (again, broadly) from an
overview of emedia reception/generation... much as exclusion of the
work of folks like kac and cayley and sondheim would (and should) be
viewed somewhat askance...

having said this, i *do* want to observe again, and for the record,
that i found much of value in loss's book...

best,

joe

ROBERT COOVER
The Grand Hotels (of Joseph Cornell)
=46ictions, 64 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 1-886224-50-1 cloth $25
ISBN 1-886224-51-x cloth, signed $50
ISBN 1-886224-52-8 paperback $10

Robert Coover takes us through the looking-glass of Joseph Cornell's=20
boxes into a world of "Grand Hotels" we never dreamed of. Rooms are=20
accessed via ferris wheel. They open onto night voyages, crystal=20
cages or sand fountains. They lead us back to childhood, to forgotten=20
games, to sleeping princesses who do not await a prince and, finally,=20
home, poor heart. Funny and wistful by turns, these brilliant=20
vignettes explore the nature of desire and the melancholy of=20
fulfilment. As the author says, the book is also intended as an=20
"architectural portrait of the artist," with biographical information=20
"built into the construction of the text like girders, brickwork, or=20
decor."

Coover's recent novels are Ghost Town (1998), Briar Rose and John's=20
Wife (both 1996), Pinocchio in Venice (1991), and Gerald's Party=20
(1985). He has received numerous honors, including the William=20
=46aulkner Award, the Brandeis Citation for Fiction, the Rea Award for=20
the Short Story, as well as fellowships from the Rockefeller and=20
Guggenheim Foundations. He lives in Providence, Rhode Island, and=20
teaches electronic and experimental writing at Brown University.

KEITH & ROSMARIE WALDROP
Ceci  n'est pas Keith-Ceci n'est pas Rosmarie
Autobiographies, 96pp., offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 1-886224-49-8, original paperback  $10

These parallel reports from two writers long together (and=20
occasionally collaborating) show characteristic differences, both of=20
background and of style.  Rosmarie meditates on early years in=20
Germany during World War II and the way her world was changed, first=20
by a bombing raid, then by learning about the Nazi regime, and by=20
emigration to the U.S.  Keith wanders from a mid-Western childhood,=20
through a Southern fundamentalist high school and college as a=20
pre-med student, to encounters in Michigan, New England and Europe.=20
        Originally commissioned by Gale Research for their=20
Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series.

        Keith Waldrop's  recent books of poetry include Haunt=20
(Instance Press) and the trilogy:The Locality Principle, The=20
Silhouette of the Bridge (America Award, 1997) and Semiramis If I=20
Remember (Avec Press). His novel, Light While There Is Light, was=20
published by Sun & Moon. He has translated a number of contemporary=20
=46rench poets and teaches at Brown University in Providence, Rhode=20
Island.
        Rosmarie Waldrop's recent books are Reluctant Gravities  (New=20

        Together, they have published Well Well Reality (Post-Apollo=20

MILLI GRAFFI
Embargoed Voice
translated from the Italian by Michael Gizzi and Giuliana Chamedes
Poems, 40pp., offset, saddle-stitched
ISBN 1-886224-55-2, $5

Graffi's poems place themselves on the edge between a highly pliant,=20
"thick" language and absence of voice. Together, these two faces of=20
the coin enact the internal splintering of the word in its role as=20
mediator. Against a tradition that has become a museum of=20
manipulative skills, Graffi values the energy in words, their ability=20
to transform themselves. "I feel words as something physical," she=20
says, "with a smell, a taste, something capable of gestures beyond=20
self-display. The desert of the blank page is actually swarming with=20
life. Go have a look."

Milli Graffi was born and still lives in Milano. In the 70ies she was=20
part of the avantgarde movement "poesia totale" around the magazine=20
Tam Tam  and performed sound poetry at  festivals in Amsterdam,=20
Paris, Cogolin and Milanopoesia. She has published three books of=20
poetry: Mille graffi e venti poesie (Geiger, 1979), Fragili film=20
(Nuovi Autori, 1987), and L'amore meccanico (Anterem, 1994). She has=20
translated Lewis Carroll and Charles Darwin into Italian and written=20
essays on Petrolini (an Italian comic of the 1910s), the avantgarde's=20
relation to the comic, and on nonsense in Marinetti, Palazzeschi and=20
Breton. She is one of the editors of il verri,  a magazine for=20
avantgarde literature.

          Michael Gizzi's recent books of poetry are My Terza Rima=20
(The Figures, 2001), cured in the going bebop (paradigm, 2000), No=20
Both (Hard Press, 1997), and Continental Harmony (Roof Books, 1991).=20
He lives in Massachusetts.
          Giuliana Chamedes was born in New York City. She has=20

Project is a week-long festival running March 3-9, 2002..  It  offers a
series of performances, readings, exhibitions, discussions, panels and
workshops focused on issues facing women in the 21st Century as described
through the artistic expression of women.  It focuses on the
multi-generational, multi-racial, international and cross-cultural
conditions affecting women worldwide. Central to the F-Word Project is the
idea that the artistic productions of women help gauge the feminine
condition in our present age.  Visit the F-Word Project web site at

A Poem for Trapped Things

This morning with a blue flame burning
this thing wings its way in.
Wind shakes the edges of its yellow being.
Gasping for breath.
Living for the instant.
Climbing up the black border of the window.
Why do you want out.
I sit in pain.
A red robe amid debris.
You bend and climb, extending antennae.

I know the butterfly is my soul
grown weak from battle.

A Giant fan on the back of
               a beetle.
A caterpillar chrysalis that seeks
a new home apart from this room.

And will disappear from sight
at the pulling of invisible strings.
Yet so tenuous, so fine
  this thing is, I am
  sitting on the hard bed, we could
  vanish from sight like the puff
    off an invisible cigarette.
Furred chest, ragged silk under
      wings beating against the glass

      no one will open.

The blue diamonds on your back
are too beautiful to do
          away with.
I watch you
     all morning
            long.
With my hand over my mouth.

David,

Let me begin by saying that talking about class on the poetics list,
like talking about anything to do with feminism, has always lead me
to frustration but I can't seem to stop doing it anyway.

Issues of class in the US are particularly complicated as it's so
often denied that social classes exist--or there is this naive
assumption that switching class is as easy as buying a new pair of
shoes.  Go to college for a couple of years and zap you're middle
class.  Or become successful writing and zap you're middle class.
I've heard more than once, for instance, that Dorothy Allison (author
of white trash classic, Bastard out of Carolina) is now middle class.
I don't know how many books had to be sold for her to make the
switch, but apparently many believe she's switched.  Also, here in
the Bay Area at least, the experimental poetry scene is so monied,
I've heard people of firmly middle class origin refer to themselves
as working class, as if working class meant anybody who worked.

It's hard to talk about class because it's existence is denied and
it's no longer on the liberal agenda, so one is seen as tedious if
one brings it up.  But when I talk with writers of working class
origin, over and over it's the same feelings of alienation and
dismissal.  And over and over I've seen incredibly intelligent and
talented writers of working class origin not get the few goodies
available to successful poets, eg, teaching and curatorial jobs and
(insular poetry scene) public adoration.  This is not some covert
bitching about my own situation--I'm talking about other writers I've
watched and known over the years.

Recently I read an essay by Catherine Clement in her collaborative
book with Julia Kristeva, The Feminine and the Sacred (I know, yucky
title) that clarified these issues for me.  In it Clement makes a
distinction between social class and class origin.  Social class can
be switched through education, jobs, etc.  But class origin comes at
birth and sticks with a person.  She compares it to caste.

"The caste has nothing to do with 'social class,' that's certain.
But it maintains a very close relationship with the old Marxist
concept of 'class origin,' that mental file drawer that determines
the drives and thoughts from birth.  For Marx, you can obviously
change your social class, but you cannot rid yourself of your 'class
origin' any more than, according to Sigmund Freud, you can rid
yourself of the unconscious.  That being the case, the 'caste' of
origin plays the same role of the return of the repressed: the
slightest opening and it comes out.  Impossible to get rid of it.  A
little emotion and it reappears." (8)

She goes on to a fascinating discussion in which she ties this to hysteria.

This division is helpful for me in thinking through my own
relationship to class, coming from a lower working class background
and functioning in the bourgeois world of experimental writing, how
no matter how I attempt to assimilate I always feel like a monkey in
a suit.  No matter what happens to me socially, I'll always consider
myself a working class writer, my gut level sense of humor, moral
system, relationship to body issues, etc.  I think my sense of
cultural clash generates energy for my work, as often happens with
writers living within two worlds.

Categories are switching and breaking down so rapidly these days that
I do think it's important to consider that in terms of class.  Last
week, when Kevin and I went to Vancouver (which was great, wonderful
writing community there, wonderful people), as we were waiting in the
customs line, there was a teenage girl behind us who had the most
bizarre accent.  She'd launch into this Valley Girl accent and then
switch to an equally strong Canadian (to our Californian ears)
accent, and she'd go back and forth, very schizzy, and it felt like
TV culture and home culture warring within her body.  All of us are
being mauled by these global forces, god help us.

Dodie

JOHN CLARKE INTERROGATED AT THE AMERIKKKAN BORDER FEB 19
Article:
INTERROGATION AT US BORDER

My name is John Clarke and I am an Organizer with the Ontario Coalition
Against Poverty (OCAP). In the early afternoon of February 19th, 2002, I
crossed the international bridge between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron,
Michigan. I was on my way to a speaking engagement that had been set up
by
students at Michigan State University.

When I pulled up my car at the customs booth, the officer asked where I
was
bound and I told him. He wanted to know on what basis I was asked to
speak
and whether I would be paid. I replied that I was with OCAP and that I
had
been told by the organizers of the meeting that an honourarium would be
provided as was normal. The officer was concerned that this meant I was
coming into the US to work. Of course, people on both sides of the border
accept speaking invitations all the time on this basis and the issue of a
work permit is never raised. At this point, the matter was nothing that
could not have been rapidly cleared up if I had been on my way to address
a
business seminar or deliver a lecture on self awareness.

As instructed by the officer, I parked my car and made my way into the
offices shared by customs and US Immigration. As soon as my ID was run
through the computer, there was a marked change in the situation. An
officer asked me more questions about my intentions in the US, what
anti-globalization protests I had attended and whether I opposed the
\'ideology of the United States\'. My car was searched and I was taken
into
a room and thoroughly (though not roughly) frisked. I was then told that
I
would be denied entry to the US and that the FBI and State Department
wanted to speak to me. Agents were on their way from Detroit I was told.

After about an hour and a half, a man entered the \'controlled
reception\'
area that I was being kept in and passed by me into the inner offices. He
was carrying a big folder and a pile of files. It struck me that he
carried
them the way a highly skilled worker might carry his or her precision
tools. He spent some time in discussion with the local officers and then
I
was brought into an interrogation room to deal with him. He introduced
himself and gave me his card. His name was Edward J. Seitz of the State
Department of the United States Diplomatic Security Service and his rank
was Special Agent. I found him to be an impressive and fascinating
character.

Seitz, with the backing of another local officer, interrogated me for
some
considerable time. It was not a situation like an arrest by Canadian
police
where silence is the best option. Had I refused to talk to him, I did not
doubt that he would order me detained and that it would be some time
before
the Canadian consular authorities came into the picture. If I was to
avoid
at least several days in detention, I determined that I had no option but
to answer his questions. It was immediately obvious to me that I was
dealing with a specialist in interrogation methods. He told the admiring
locals at one point that he had been stationed in Yemen and I avoided
speculating on how he had employed his talents there.

Seitz\'s basic strategy, apart from general intelligence gathering, was
to
try and set me up to tell him something false that would place me in the
situation of violating US law. He began with some very basic questions on
my personal background, extremely affable in his manner and striking a
pose
of mild confusion that was designed to make me underestimate him. He then
asked about OCAP. He told me it sounded like we were good people but he
had
heard something about an organization that a year or so before had been
involved in a confrontation with the police at the Ontario Legislature.
That wasn\'t us was it? The trap was clear and I told him that we were
indeed that organization. His affable manner then vanished and his
difficulties in focusing his thoughts ended. He gradually moved his chair
over so we were right up against each other and fired questions at me. He
wanted to know about the June 15, 2000 March on the Ontario Legislature
where the Toronto police attacked a march against homelessness that we
had
organized. He wanted to know about charges that the police have laid
against me. He wanted to know how OCAP is structured and who are the
members of its elected executive committee (which I refused to tell him).

Seitz then took up the question of OCAP\'s friends and allies in the US.
Are we involved in anti globalization work. Isn\'t this a cover for
anarchism? Was I personally an anarchist or a socialist? (In the
interests
of anti-capitalist unity, I won\'t say which one of these I acknowledged
I
was). Seitz had a huge file on OCAP with him that included leaflets from
public speaking events I had been at in the US. He knew the name of the
man
I stayed with the last time I was in Chicago. He wanted to know who I
spoke
to in the Chicago Direct Action Network. He claimed that I was an
advocate
of violence and that my association with DAN showed this but (in a rare
stumble) could find nothing in their literature that proved that they
call
for violence.

This phase of the questioning went on for a long time. He covered a great
deal of ground and had at his disposal voluminous information on us. He,
obviously, had been in contact with the Canadian police but was most
interested on our US allies. The exception was an enormous interest in
Canadian anti capitalist activist, Jaggi Singh. He knew that he and I had
spoken at the same meetings and was most anxious to find out if he was
also
in the US. He showed me a picture of Jaggi and wanted to know where he
was
at that moment.

Suddenly, the mask of affability went back on. I was a \'gentleman\' and
he
didn\'t want to lock me up. I was ok but he couldn\'t understand how I
worked with a \'violent man like Mr. Singh\'. Then he told me he would
have
to ban me from the US but I could go to the US Consulate in Toronto and
apply for a waiver. I could just take a seat in the waiting room while
they
prepared some paper work but I would soon be on my way. I had not been
sitting out there long, however, before the Special Agent came out to try
a
new tack that I had heard of in the past. Essentially, his plan was to
make
me think he was utterly mad and, thereby, rattle me to the point where I
lost my judgement.

I assume the method works better if it is used after serious sleep
deprivation. He came over and sat next to me right there in the waiting
area with other people around. He had a few OCAP cheques that he asserted
showed I was bringing with me the means to live illegally in the US. I
was
going to jail, he asserted. I explained that the cheques were in my bag
because I always kept a few with me to cover the cost of office supplies
and suchlike and that I had seen no reason to take them out just because
I
was going to spend a few hours in Michigan.

Then came the most astounding part of the whole interrogation. Out of the
blue, Seitz demanded to know where Osama Bin Laden was hiding. I knew
were
he was, he insisted. If I grew a beard I would look like Bin Laden. I was
holding back on telling him why I was going to the university and who I
was
going to meet there. If I didn\'t want to go to jail, it was time to tell
him the real story. I replied that I had been quite open with him about
my
intentions and that sending me to jail was now up to him. He laughed,
told
me there were no problems. I could go home after all. Did I drink tea of
coffee? Would I have a coffee with him if he came up to Toronto. I told
him
I would, which was the only lie I told that day, and he gathered up his
files and left. Shortly after this, the local officials gave me the free
ticket for the bridge which is the only perk that comes along with being
denied entry to the US and, a little over five hours after coming over, I
headed back to the Canadian side.

Ditto to Michael Bibby in regard to his praise for Maria Damon's and Carey
Nelson's books.  Both indispensable.  And I'll have to check out Michael's
Vietnam book--sounds fascinating.

Just looked at the HOW2 site.  Some interesting stuff there as well.

What emerges from the different comments I've seen is that the idea of
"working-class poetry" involves a wickedly convoluted and sometimes
contradictory complex of assumptions:
1) that if you are working-class, your writing somehow inevitably "reflects"
that status, either in thematics or formally or both (which might seem like
a fair assumption, seeing that no progressive or radical thinker would dream
of questioning the parallel axiom that bourgeois and aristocratic values and
experience are reflected in the literature produced by the bourgeoisie and
aristocrats);
2) that working-class poets are more likely to be "content-driven," whereas
bourgeois poets are more likely to be formally "experimental" or
obscurantist;
3) that working-class poets write for working-class readers, and bourgeois
poets for bourgeois readers, etc.;
4) that working-class poets are often limited in their range and efficacy by
naive, sentimental, or otherwise unsophisticated conventions;
5) that working-class poets have some sort of duty to represent their
experience as members of that class;
6) conversely, that _only_ working-class poets are legitimately authorized
to represent such experience: no one but members of the working class can be
working-class poets, whereas no such restriction applies to working-class
poets who wish to represent bourgeois or aristocratic experience, or if it
does, it is not as clearly articulated (note that this is a historically
specific observation--such restrictions _were_ implicit in, say, early
modern culture);
7) that working-class poets who try to write in "innovative" forms are
sacrificing the vital transparency that alone is capable of rendering the
material immediacy of their economic conditions in favor of an elitist mode
that is indelibly inscribed with the dominant ideology which oppresses the
working classes;
8) that working-class poets who _don't_ write in innovative forms are
closed-minded and provincial;
9) "innovative," "experimental," etc., mean the same things for
working-class poets that they do for bourgeois poets;
and so on.

With a mess like this, one is tempted to suspect that the entire concept is
next to worthless.  And yet, one of the most striking features of
experimental poetry since the 70's, for example and maybe especially
Language Poetry, has been its situation in a context of working-class
concerns.  The idea of class seems absolutely essential in gauging the
social significance of post-Open Form theory and praxis.  Ron Silliman is
clearly a working-class poet in an important sense (and I don't recall
offhand if I know anything about his actual economic background; I'm talking
about the way his work reads, the kinds of experience it invokes).  John
Ashbery, not so much.  But both poets would probably be categorized by most
readers as on the same side of this working-class/experimental divide that
is in question.  That is, on the experimental side.  In other words,
"working-class poet" is a kind of self-defeating label: in order to have it
attached to you, your work needs to be identified as "non-experimental"
beforehand, or else no one will take the label seriously.

So where does that leave poets like Silliman, or Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, or
myself, who draw heavily on working-class perceptions and experiences?  I
suspect that few people who come to my work for the first time would go away
thinking "working-class poetry," and yet, I do feel that my economic
background (which is actually less working-class than welfare-class) is
somehow, however obliquely, a factor in my writing.  For example, I suspect
that my "sampling" of pop culture references might in many cases have a
different meaning from a "non-working-class" poet's "sampling," however
formally similar our two approaches.   But I'll stop here for now.

        This is very sad news. Last Thursday a friend and I were reading over his
poetry, she being new to his work and he an old favorite. His work was
celebrated as some of the over cheap red wine. I never met him but know he
moved through Buffalo's streets - I am very sad but wish him well on his
journey.

Sad news: John Wieners died yesterday, 1 March 2002 in Boston. He was
hospitalized about a week ago when he was found unconscious some time after
leaving a party. The cause of death was a brain aneurysm. Wieners was one of
the great lyric voices -- with all the psychic cracks & sufferings such a
stance entails -- of the second half of the past century.

        Here is his bio note from the "Selected Poems 1958-1984" volume
(Black
Sparrow Press, 1986):

        JOHN WIENERS was born in Milton, Mass, in 1934 and received his A.B.
from
Boston College in 1954. He studied at Black Mountain College under Charles
Olson and Robert Duncan from 1955 to 1956. He returned to Boston where he
brought out three issues of a literary magazine, Measure, over the next
several years. From 1958 to 1960 he lived in San Francisco, and was an
active participant in the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance movement. He
returned to Boston in 1960, and divided his time between there and New York
City, over the next five years. In 1965 he enrolled in the Graduate Program
of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and worked as a teaching
fellow. He has worked as an actor and stage manager at the Poet's Theatre,
Cambridge, and has had three of his plays performed at the Judson Poet's
Theater, N.Y. Since 1970 he has lived and worked in Boston, where he has
been active in publishing and education cooperatives, political action
committees, and the gay liberation movement.

        And here is a poem from his 1964 book _Ace of Pentacles_:

An Anniversary of Death

He too must with me wash his body, though
at far distant time and over endless space
take the cloth unto his loins and on his face
engage in the self same rising as I do now.

A cigarette lit upon his lips; would they were mine
and by this present moon swear his allegiance.
If he ever looks up, see the clouds and breeches
in the sky, and by the stars, lend his eyes shine.

What do I care for miles? or rows of friends lined
up in groups? blue songs, the light's bright glare.
Once he was there, now he is not; I search the empty air
the candle feeds upon, and my eyes, my heart's gone blind

to love and all he was capable of, the sweet patience
when he put his lips to places I cannot name
because they are not now the same
sun shines and larks break forth from winter branches.

Dear Kasey and whoever else,

  I've been waiting for Ron Silliman himself to jump into this but, for
whatever reason, it doesn't seem he will this time. Ron is definitely of
working class origin, as am I, as is Laura Moriarty, as is Tom Raworth, just
to name a few. The people who say "innovative" poetry and or Langpo is
produced by trust fund babies aren't really in touch with (all the) facts.
   But, going beyond the issue of class origin,  I'm interested in what Hardt
and Negri say about the 21st century proletariat. They say the new working
class is largely composed of various "knowlege workers"  -from the data entry
employee to the "adjunct," "part-time" college teacher - who lack job
security and benefits, living hand to mouth, as the industrial proletariat
did before (and after) the heyday of the unions.
There are no doubt problems with this idea, but I think it's worth
discussing.

Thanks to Kasey for his comments below on working-class poetry.  In
semi-response I thought I'd post a short section of my long editor's note
to COMBO 8, which was itself a roving response to Steve Evans' critique of
FENCE and the broo-ha-ha which followed ('member that??): this little
snippet seems relevant to Kasey's comments:

[Evans sees the acceptance of (and appearance in) Fence by many
avant-garde writers whom he admirers as emblematic of a capitulation to
the basic model of literary king-making which the work of those writers
would seem to repudiate.  Clover, in his response, calls Evans' out for
positing a moment (nostalgic) when the avant-garde wasn't complicit, if
not with the poetic mainstream than with the economic mainstream:

"It's nobody's secret that the avant-garde pursues radical invention,
discovery, practice, et cet, in a space cleared, with fierce frequency, by
personal wealth. Indeed, I know myself as the mainstream not because you
appointed me thus in '98, but because I've never inherited a penny."

This last equation (a-g = patronized, m-s = unpatronized working world) is
a gross reduction which depends for its effect on an extremely limited
definition of "avant-garde" (perhaps buoyed by the continental flavor of
the word, which is why I've always preferred "experimental" though Clover
links that one to the phenomenon whereby "captains of industry...have
in-house invention centers" which in turn affirms his earlier point that
"trust funds act as the market's Research & Development funds.")  By his
definition, we would have to pretend, for instance, that the Black Arts
movement was not an avant-garde movement.  Likewise we would have to
pretend that the work of poets who are part of the Combo community - from
Kristen Gallagher to Mark Sardinha - are either being supported by parents
firmly ensconced  in the middle or upper class, or are the twice removed
recipients of trust-fund bonuses.  Both implied propositions are,
incidentally, complete horseshit.  Sardinha, as he mentioned in his
contributors note to Combo 7, gets his writing done while (or despite)
working full time as a pipefitter in Fall River, MA; the writing is some
of the best going, really important, original work: original in the sense
that he is genuinely modifying the Anglo-American language.  Clover's
narrative can't account for a writer like Sardinha any more than it can
account for the moment in which Rodrigo Toscano read and discussed his
poem, "Notes on the Great Strike of '97" with his fellow union workers, as
he described during PhillyTalks 5; writing that Barrett Watten has
described as "anything but a uniform aporia of surfaces and disavowed
meaningsÉrejecting both univocal materiality and its supporting idealist
investments..."]

That's what I wrote several months ago.  I'll only add, for lack of time,
that having talked to Josh Clover since, it's clear to me that his
self-definition above was meant to be ironic: i.e. to point out not that
he was a part of the mainstream in regards to the form or content of his
work, necessarily, but rather that economic factors placed him thus.  This
does not seem to me to be the case but it does add nuance top mey original
reading of his critique.

Rae,

Having entered the Bay Area writing scene when the lang-pos were on
the rise, the general perception that was fed to me as a young writer
was that it was a carefully orchestrated group endeavor, a take over.
I was too naive at the time to have any accurate personal
perceptions.  But I doubt the movement would have been nearly as
effective if it was just a bunch of working class folks getting
together.  No doubt, there is more class variety among lang-pos than
is sometimes assumed, but I don't think you can dismiss the
importance of class privilege in the movement.

And when did Laura Moriarty become a language poet?  I'm glad to see
she's finally being included.

 From my youthful field observation, an important impact the lang-pos
had on the Bay Area scene was redefining what a poet was--from
drunken, lascivious party animal to professional.  Readings became
literary events and everybody got rigorous.  Arcane vocabularies were
introduced that I saw people scrambling to learn.  In the early 80s a
mentor said to me, "Writing is a middle class occupation, and if you
want to be a writer you've got to learn to be more middle class."  I
was appalled, but the same info was passed on to me, over and over,
in more subtle ways.

And yes, the class oppression in adjuncting.

when has there ever been a working class poetics? There have been poets who
identified with the "masses"like Neruda, Levine, Cardenal et cetera but even
they were not working class, a friend  told me once the working class does
not have a poetics because they work, allot.  I think that the real issue to
ask (an I consider myself a follower of a post-language poetics) is how do
you address the real mass in the USA and Europe which is the office worker.
The "professional"who lives in the suburbs ot yuppiedum and does not reflect
and poetry does not even enter their minds.  I think that if that group
could be addressed in some way a real social movement based on poetics could
realized. This was done in Chile in the 1960's and in other nations because
a poetical sense effected the middle classes.
Now in nations with a real working class like in the developing world there
is a chance for a real working class poetics but unfortunately Americans and
Europeans live in Thorsten Veblen's leisure class

As you say, Rae, there are problems with this, #1 being: the "old" working
class doesn't seem to be any less present and oppressed than it ever was
(but I haven't read Hardt & Negri, & may be construing them too
simplistically).  Nevertheless, as one of their "new" proles, i.e. a
frequent adjuncter (tho I'm currently enjoying a 2-year visiting position
with the title of assistant professor, decent pay, and benefits--hallelujah,
and may my next gig not be a backsliding into part-timing), I am intrigued
as to what new social formations of class-identity and prejudice might
attend this development.  To me, the signal aspect of the old-school working
class is, as Dodie points out, a certain behavioral stigma or imprint that
manifests itself in our sense of humor, taste in clothes and food, learned
willingness to submit to various opiates both chemical and ideological, etc.
  OUR TENDENCY TO BE LOUD TALKERS, and again as Dodie so aptly put it, the
"monkey-in-a-suit" anxiety.  Could there be a total reversal, wherein the
new technocrats and monied philistines are the ones stamped as "dufuses" and
"geeks," and the new working class is cast as a great unwashed sea of
erudition?  Or would the invisible lines of power allow for such an
incongruous mix?  How do they maintain class superiority ideologically when
it's perfectly clear that the poor are the smarter ones?  I guess the answer
is obvious, and it's already happening: through beauty and "cool," through
material accumulation encoded as sophistication.

The recent economy has been so porous and unstable that it points up a very
important fact: there's nothing inherently noble or decent about being
working-class (in case anyone was still suffering under that romantic
delusion), since many of the new rich are former working-class, and many of
the important cultural textures that are disappearing from our lives are
centuries-old bourgeois and aristocratic inventions: manners, taste,
discretion, sentiment, etc.  These things are important not because they're
essential qualities on some transcendent plane; obviously they have been and
continue to be some of the most insidious ideological tools employed to
maintain oppressive divisions, etc.  Rather, they are quite simply the best
constructs we know that are occasionally capable of forestalling violence,
instilling tolerance, enriching life experience, and all that good stuff.

So part of the onus I feel as a working-class poet is the imperative to
maintain class distinction (not to be a class traitor, in other words) while
also working to _change_ the definition of what counts as prole expression,
even if that means dipping into the Opponent's inkwell.

This is, among other things, a dilemma for representation.  How to represent
prole experience without either idealizing it or reducing it to reactionary
satire?  And, on top or subsuming that difficulty, whether to "represent" in
any traditional sense at all, since the mimetic gesture per se is so subject
to ideological suspicion on the part of the avant garde?
Neoconfessionalism, anyone?  Didn't think so.

Dodie,

  Yes, it did very much matter that some people had the personal resources
(and the optimism) to start presses such as The Figures or Tuumba, etc.
Without them - without that - it would have been another story. Actually
there would have been no story. As for Laura M., I didn't mean to open up the
topic of who is a "language poet" and who isn't. That's pretty tired. I just
wrote because some of the generalizations I've read irritated me a little.

Kasey,

  Much industrial labor is being (notoriously) exported to the third world.
That's one reason the face of the prole is changing. Hardt and Negri talk
about that, of course. What they don't seem to get into is the "service
sector" as the new dominant working class in the U.S. It's more glamorous to
talk about the "knowledge worker, I suppose. They were talking about the
armies of computer programmers and office managers, etc.  I threw in the
adjunct academic because it fits and because it's an issue I'm close to. It's
piece-work for the educated. And you're right, it's hard to know what it
means in terms of psychological class identification or self-identification.
Economically, though, it's more clear-cut. Well, I've gotta go. It's Sunday
so naturally I have work to do.

Once again a poet has passed without my knowing him or his work.  I don't want to see his work relegated to a nicheor subject but the most i can do is ponder the words of his I can locate:

half-a-decade of rest, the skin on my legs has changed it holds
together
now as a rich person by itself, I have vowed I shall never be
again and know
I shall never be lonely again, because of the love that dwells
within poetry's mouth

so what or who are "working class poets".. if we follow the dictum that
each new class coming into being in the terrain of production and the
terrain of history creates,alongside itself, a stratum or "organic
intellectuals" who explain itself to itself (e.g., they sit about the
throne forever telling him who sits thereon who he is), must working class
poets come strictly from the working class? "organic intellectuals" as
poets may understand the real social substrate yet not be from the "working

what does that tell us about al poets who are not at the direct point of
social location?  what does that say about donn, jonson, shakespeare
marlowe etc?  why care about clifton, sexton and rich? and homer?  to whom
do we give an ear and why?

And ideology is, of course, the problem.  When has the working class, however
current their characterization, not been at the mercy of ideologues?  Putting
aside for the moment that mimetic gestures are possible only as semiotic
play, the notion that all "representational" language serves
corportate/capitalist agendas is itself suspect.  On the one hand, we
understand how bombarded we are by information controlled and delivered by
corporate agencies.  A good chunk of the language has most certainly been
co-opted by commercial interests.  But does the avant-garde as it is lately
understood, i.e., as radical formalism, constitute a serious reaction to
dehumanization, an escape plan, or does it merely reinforce the bars?  The
technology required for much avant-garde production is corporate initiated
and owned, and is well situated within the monied class.  So if the argument
against representation includes some notion of dispensing with the tools of
capitalism, e.g., the self, mimetic language, etc., then we may be in an even
worse fix if we exchange those "traditions" for an artistic technocracy.  In
such a case artists may become less and less relevant, if that's possible.
Is there much difference between a conventional love poem's resting upon a
bourgeois/romantic idea of self cum dust bowl idealization, and any
"avant-garde" production that reminds us up front of the textualized self in
a room full of working class computer drones?  Is it possible that corporate
dominion might actually prefer the latter?  Surely we are all familiar with
the capitalist mindset that swallows everything with a shrug, with a "I don't
know what it means, but I can buy and sell it."  That mindset, it seems,
fears only those things it finds meaningful, the challenge it understands.

I don't know the answers, of course.  But it does seem common sensical that
if we care for the exploited, we'll want to communicate with them, and with
ourselves since most of us are exploited.  That means going to them, and in a
language they understand, without sacrificing formal integrity.  A tall
order.  But I do consider that is how the future calls to us.  Ideologies are
certainly interesting, usually dangerous.  But perhaps we have forgotten,
those among us who feel utterly isolated and "meaningless," that people are
more important than art.  Best, Bill

okay to weigh in on the trivial side of things --i have known working-class
folks who are soft-spoken, diffident, have understated but wickedly sharp
senses of humor, etc... i take your point about style and stigma, but i
always feel the need to point out that these are generalizations to which
many exceptions can be found.  to recall a differently inflected case, i
remember in my late teens telling a classmate at my superWASPy girls'
school that my father was Jewish.  "Dr. Damon is Jewish?"  she asked
incredulously.  "But...he's not vulgar!"  (This girl had a Jewish
boyfriend, and her father was totally flipping out about it.

Well, this describes me (and I assume a bunch (more than some, less than a
lot?) of people on this list.  I don't know that I'd describe myself as
working class though (not that I'm opposed to that term to describe myself,
but given my traditional (blue collar (whatever the hell that means (I mean
I know (but I don't know (you know?)))), physical labor oriented)
definition of working class I don't really see that description as applying
to me.)  Though I am poor and have no job security and regularly write
checks for things I can't live without (food, electricity, rent) whose only
hope of clearing is by miracle.  So I guess it depends on how much your
income has to do with what class you're in.  Though I know some people
who've lived high on the hog, as they say, with only a few clams to their
names.  Por exemplo, if I didn't owe the gubment all the money I do
(student loans, parking - speeding - etc. tickets, taxes (though I'm sort
of in favor of the taxes I must say)) and all the rest of the people I owe
money too, then I might be too.  But then you've got the parent/background
thing (which sounds almost at times like it's giving the same kind of
transference rules to economic class as are given to race/ethnicity (which
I don't know if is wrong/right (or whether it even matters) but is
interesting and worth thinking more about (by me or you or someone else))
which some have implied.  Like, my background I would describe as middle
class (though so would roughly 75% of US citizens from a wide variety of
backgrounds I heard in one study about (sorry to be vague and nonsensical
-- that is to say:  everybody in the US thinks they're middle class)) cuz I
had all the stuff I needed (food, clothes, shelter, pens and paper) and a
bunch of stuff I didn't (a cool bike, fast tennis shoes, a guitar, an
allowance) and we never had too too much to worry about except when I asked
for something like some goofy shirt with some stripes and paislies and
three collars and buttons up one armpit and then my mom said "we don't have
the money."  And my dad's a dr. geologist at a research foundation and my
mom's a public middle school art teacher (I know bless her soul -- she's
retiring this year) so while the money wasn't plentiful in the early days
there was never a permanent lack and they've even had some extra to help
(tho then there's that old give a man -- teach a man question (though
sometimes I just want a goddamn fish)) me (sometimes a lot) through thin
times over the years.  Though I never had a trust fund, but got a grand
from an aunt who died (a really wonderful woman who'll I'll miss who could
play the violin and insult you as sweet as you may.)  But maybe what I'm de
facto describing as working class is really just abject poverty and so I
1.) don't know what working class is (see above parenthetical statement)
2.) or I've been it for a long time and just didn't know (see the another
parenthical statement above) 3.) something else I can't yet imagine/think
if only to debinarinize what I'm saying/not saying? (shit did it again)
Then there's what Dodie said (which has resonance (meaning I can imagine it
happening with ease/little work -- mine that is) for me though no one ever
said it to me and I didn't think it till Dodie said it (you know?)) about
having to be more middle class to be a writer.  I mean what does it mean to
be more middle class?  When I read that I had a series of reactions which
are bound to my traditional (western, white, middle class (circular you
say? (what a clusterfuck, huh?))) notions of class and seem to be echoed in
others people's posts (that there's even been a question of intelligence
and an implied "dumbing down" in relation to working class
poets/poems/poetics) and it had something to do with my own traditional
ideas of high/low culture and like you gotta like monet and pate to be
middle class (or something really dumb like that (cuz really everybody
should like pate (really (it can be sooo good -- mmmmmm.))))  But I've got
this dream see? this dream that someday some someday I'll get a callback or
a writeback from one of the unversities to which I send "cover letter,
C.V., and three recommendations" and I'll put on a suit and talk and flirt
and look people in the eye over a firm handshake and enough of a smile to
seem friendly but not too much so I look brainless and get the job -- the
real job, the job with the money and the security and the graduate classes
that are about more than what to do with an enthymeme aside from with the
coffee.  See?  And I'll even get to keep writing weird poems that don't
make sense about a town everybody hates (washington, dc.)  And so I think
the scope of somebody's (anybody's really even your body's) dreams has
something to do with class (which is why we all think we are?) -- cuz my
life maybe/maybe not be working class, but damn if my dreams aren't (like
it or no) middle class, you know what I mean?  And I gotta wonder (cuz I do
and I think should) if I'm gonna get my dream and if I do if I'm gonna
think it actually sucks.  But what else am I gonna do (poet, slack-ass mf
as I am (though for any possible employers who ever read this that's no
comment on my academic, teacherly, or intellectual productivity -- which
has been remarked as high by many I might add (if I added, but I don't
that's my friend Hugh's job who's a Knotitian) (see letters of rec)))?  I'd
really like to know.

This is the wrong way to say that I'm with Rae and wondering about this
stuff too and I'd like to hear what smarter people have to say about the
questions?  Especially cuz "working class" seems at times in many types of
discussion to become an icon without even considering what working class
poets/poetics/poems are.

you know, I always thought that lang-po was a Chinese working class poet
from the early 20th century or, perhaps, a haiku master.  how surprising to
find out that there are/were many lang-pos. maybe many good Chinese working
class poets.

there are no social movements based on poetics.  there never were. that's a
romance.  social movements are based on jobs, bread, housing, health care
etc.  poetry changes nothing but your mind.  and, it doesn't even do
that.  it only helps the change along that has already been
brewing.  poetry is not the material basis of change. it is the voice of
need and the voice of reflection and the voice of desire, now and then and
again.

To David, Dodie and The List(ers). This is interesting. I agree that the
class origions are kind of "stamped" into one. That is the same as the way
that in our formative years certain things we learn or experience have
profound and long-lasting effects - it doesnt mean we are slaves to them. We
can change, but there will still remain certain attitudes, reactions etc
"deep" in our psyche so to speak. The individual has control over his/her
life but there are large, general forces, that create what is known as the
"class system" and the US, NZ (my own country)the Euroean nations, Canada
and Australia, and in fact all countries in the world have there own class
(and religious etc) structures. Religions and culture "interfere" with these
structures which are almost universal: and in general the Marxist picture is
correct in regard to the world: the bourgeiosie - who were once the middle
class - are now in fact the ruling class (the owners of the means of
production) and in this the term bourgeious and "middle class" gets
confused: (as my spelling of bourgeios does!) the middle class that most
people refer to is that "better-off class" in their own country eg people
who might be  technitians or engineers, or accountants etc being "higher"
than factory workers....and so on ...
  I was brought up in a working class area, and my parents were basically
from working class origions, but my father had become  an architect: now I
always felt somewhat alienated from both the "higher" people AND the "lower"
... eg truck drivers etc but coupled to that was my own very (as a teenager
and a young man) introverted and sometimes almost psychopathically arrogant
nature: so my "alienation" is hard for me to say came from being working
class...I ( which contradicted my alternating "sweet" and "quiet" nature on
the outside...and so on) worked for many years in factories, eg a cheese
factory, a fibre glass factory, a foundry (terrible job!), freezing works,
Railway Workshops (where I met some communists and got interested in active
politics), builder's labourer, timber worker, house removals (15 hour days),
paint factory, car manufacuring assembly line, bed making factory, in a
factory that made "stereos" (the rubber things for printing), wool store, a
radio factory, a television assembly line, and then I worked as a
lineman-cable jointer eventually becoming a foreman on the NZ Post Office
(now Telecom which is partly US controlled) and then in the New Zealand
electricity communications section as a (hands on) engineering tech on
radio, microwave (involving eg being 100 metres on a tower to reorient the
polarity of an antenna which means one has to use a safety belt (to "lean
out into space", so as to work with both hands,so to speak), then I did some
fence contracting, had a business clearing rubbish, then a job in a freight
company where I hurt my back very badly. Meantime I got my NZCE
(Telecommunications and electronics) and the a degree in English (Lit and
some philosophy).  Now i'm "building a second hand book business...online
mostly...
   But I've never felt "working class" ... I was and still am very much a
loner  ... I missed out that I was happily married for some years and have
three (mostly very happy children: the youngest is 23 and is about  in a
month to make me a grandpa!!
   I have never felt comfortable all that time though with either the
"better" people or some of the more "basic" working class types....
  However: however that feeling of alienation from (well even some of the
University academics I've met whom I dont "hate" or anything, but sense a
kind of  "scorn" for myself: but that sense of scorn could well just be a
bit of normal paranoia (we all have a dash of p. in us))...
   And I think that the original Richard, who was once very "intense" and
febrile if now older is still "at the core" still the "supersensitive" (a
doctor's term about me) person I was: of course I am now a much more open,
confident and self-reliant and personable person than I was a 20 year
old.....in fact using the concepts of Dr Wayne Dyer I have reached the stage
in which I almost am never unhappy (exempting natural events such as family
events and so on), have virtually no depression and feel very much in
control of my own abilityto be happy at mostvtimes and deal with everything
that life throws my way: even an announcement that I was termally ill I
would now see as a challenge, althoug I;m not encouraging old "Death" too
much!!..........
  But to what extent is any poetry I have or would write is or might be
"working class" ... I think that people are thinking about these things
lately because of the terrible (and in some ways good) "jolt" caused by S11
and its aftermath: at the very least we are all suddenly thinking more
"politically" and I was thinking (just before this working class poetry
debate began) what kind of poetry would be meaning full in a world where
classes per se had been gradually "withered away" (we are talking a very
long time span), and there is one world and every one is  - more or less -
on an equal footing: as Mao tse Tung points out, even as Socialism is
implemented, there are still many struggles (between or intra-class, between
men and women, the sceintific or materialist versus the idealist, right or
wrong versus right or wrong however these are defined, and one can
extrapolate "progress" versus the "bite-back" effect of so-called progress,
and so on): so we dont get the kind of  lobotomised dullness that certain
right wingers would predict (any more than the capitalist revolutions  that
brought our present system into being meant that culture music art etc and
any other creativity were (was) lessened)....in this respect we can see why
Zukofsky (himself of working class origions) is as important as Stevens or
Lorine Niedecker or Ed Dorn or indeed even Wieners or any poet or eg to some
people Rod McKuen, or the "Liverpool Poets" - or Robert Creeley whose
certainly "been around" a bit....another poet who worked for years in
factories etc was Peter Reading: who is a darkly humorous poet and one of my
favourites...in Australia there's Les Murray (a bit of a red neck) and Ern
Malley
and Francis Webb and so on: here james K Baxter came to be a sort of
Christ-communist figure..but he (whatever his origions) certainly highly
"academic", Bill Manhire is of strange origions (apparently his father was a
publican but he hates the "boozey" romantic image of "crazy poets" so he
obviously would disapprove of Spicer or even our own Sam Hunt who is a great
poet in his own way but has - I have detected - the residue of a plum in hs
maw....but Bob Orr is quite definitely "working class" and has worked for
years at sea and so forth (is called by an Auckland journalist "New
Zealand's greatest living poet"), but who reads very widely and voraciously
(as I know according to a fellow Auckland book dealer).....   To what extent
can "art" be a near (or completely) autonomous thing free of class (hence
political inferences and so on): after all some things to repet the old
cliche are "universal" ..."love", death, pain, fear, ecstasy even curiosity
and the drive for knowledge. Scroggin's book on Zukofsky is subbed "And the
poetry of knowledge")... I think as we drive (eventually) toward a more
egalitarian world we will see greater and more marvellous works by more
people: but his wont devalue the "difficult" writers. We will all maybe see
qualities in things as differnces rather than in hierarchies altho I suppose
the old  (genetic?) drive to form hierarchies will struggle with
"democracy"....
  We can all be or bcome "monkeys in suits" but we aren't doomed to that:
against the "historical forces" thesis the contradiction of  "free will"
will create the new antithesis. Whatever new forms human creativity takes it
will always be complex simple surprising and rich. Richard.

Ken. You're roght I think i much you say: but he strict definion of working
class would actually include everyone EXCEPT people who own the meeans of
production. Now the psychlogical social and other orientations are important
plus what you (or I ) have "received" from our parents (both in material
terms and psychological input (some things in families transcend class: eg
love, survival, sibling rivalry (in as much as they are not "coloured" by
other class factors, religion - which may (usually is) be linked to
class))....so its not how much you earn: the well known phenomena of the guy
or guyesses who lives on credit (infact that's how the X's lived in
Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" - was it the Sharp's?) and the crooks who live for
years on stolen credit cards...a knowledge worker which is what I bacame
(somewhat) or was becoming before I went back to uni to do English (which is
not a money-earning class climbing degree so to speak) is still a worker: an
accountant is a worker: even a bank manager, even an astronomer, or a
sharebroker: of course these people are more likely to be "bourgeios (ruling
class) orientated and capable of  becoming of the rulng class (owner of the
means of production) and some "working class" people have shares: my
grandfather in London was a petit bourgeois (I still cant spell that  word)
and so on...but we are all of us descended from the Big Bang: the class
system exists, but the coming annihiliation of the Universe probably also
exists as up until I last heard Steven hawking still existed.....I'm not
telling anyone anything when I say that the thinking of  a "rich" worker
might be "left wing" and a "worker" in a factory in China or Indonesia or
wherever might be "right wing" and vica versa.... But I'm going to study
your and others's emails more and then write somethin' more....You are like
me: probably well to do working class on a low income but with lots of
"perks" and live well but alweays paying bills and moaning but basically
having a great time: only diffrence son is that I've slowed down at 50 and
only get drunk in charge, not so many speeding tickets!! Not chasing
"sheilas" (kiwi for young women) like I used ta.  Cheers, Richard.

This sounds so much like the "good old days" circa 1970 when I (ever so
briefly) lived in Buffalo during the height of Vietnam War // Kent State
shooting paranoia. We went over the border (not to give readings, but just
to go to Toronto or the beach) several times and were pulled over and
harrassed every single time (hubcaps taken off the car to see where the
drugs & guns might be, that sort of thing). It got to be a running joke. I
remember once coming back with Alan Feldman, we began giggling in
anticipation about 15 minutes north of the crossing point and were in such
hysterics that Alan told the guard "I sure hope you can find our dope,
because we can't find it anywhere"). Got searched that time too.

& since Rae has invoked my name on the working class stuff, it's true. I
think the question of class background, class orientation and class stance
(three very different things) has to be asked in all cases & that the
question of "what is the working class" circa 2002 is likewise very big.
Negri and Hardt are not the best thinkers on this (or most other) issues. I
do think that working with labor unions (for example) is totally good work,
but the idea that it is anything other than trying to solve a beheading with
bandaids is simply nostalgia. The underlying problem is that at this moment
in history capitalism has lost its Other and what comes closest, alas, is
theocratic fascism. The anti-globalism movement, taken as a whole, is
frankly not promising, though it is within that coalition that answers will
have to be found.

Please tell me you're being ironic.

OK, granted, if by "leisure" you mean the state of mass hallucination piped
in to our living-space boxes via TV, fast food, and subliminal billboards
which convinces us we are privileged to live in said boxes and that there i=
s
something called a "vote," sure, it's a leisure class.  Or if "leisure"
means any standard of living even marginally above starving to death in a
ditch with flies all over you.

And this idea of nations with a "real" working class, which are accordingly
equipped to produce a "real" working-class poetics: is this really the
algebra by which we want to define the relation of a poetics to a given
class?  Imagine if only "real" cowboys could write "real" cowboy poetry, or
only "real" linguists could write "real" Language poetry, or ... well, you
get the idea.

Of course there is a working-class poetics in America.  Or more accurately,
there are working-class poeticses.  For example, no matter what you think o=
f
Philip Levine's merit as a writer, or what his economic background really
counts as ("lower leisure class"?) he clearly engages working-class concern=
s
in his work, and seems to conceive of his larger image as a poet very much
as an outgrowth of that identity.  On the other end of the spectrum, someon=
e
like Rodrigo Toscano does the exact same thing (the difference being that
his poetics works to analyze rather than represent).

And another important thing: the meaning/value of a poem changes radically
depending on our knowledge of who wrote it.  Suppose you've got some barely
literate lifer in San Quentin who writes an ode to freedom in end-stopped
rhyming couplets with no discernible meter, and this ode has lots of
references to iron bars and cruel wardens and electric chairs, etc.
Obviously this guy's work is all about authenticity and direct communicatio=
n
of emotions, and the form is an expedient chassis.  Anyone who judges it on
the basis of that form is missing the point, and pretty insensitive to boot=
.
The social context of prison life demands that we acknowledge such work in
terms of a poetics of expressivity or reject it outright.  In fact, some
people who otherwise have no patience for expressivism will accept it in
this context, even to the point of active critical celebration.  (I'm not
getting into whether this is valid or not, I'm just making an observation;
also, I _know_ that not all prison poetry is crude doggerel, so anyone who
was planning to climb all over my back with that objection can just get
right down off it in advance.)  If the same poem were submitted in a
portfolio for admittance to an MFA workshop in Vermont or somewhere, and it
would be treated as either pathetically naive or a joke.  Then again, if it
turned up in a volume of Charles Bernstein's poetry, it would still be take=
n
as a "joke" of sorts, but a joke with "serious" literary implications.  I
would argue, however, that in all three cases it remains a "prison poem."

Now let's imagine another San Quentin lifer, but let's give him a graduate
degree.  Let's say this one's poem is constructed according to a mixture of
Cagean proceduralism and Swinburnian polymetrical decadence.  Let's say it
has no overt reference to prison or crime or freedom or any of that stuff i=
n
it.  Oh hell, let's say it's a writing-through of Barrett Watten's _Plasma_=
.
It's copiously footnoted and gets published in _Open Letter_.  Is this
prison poetry?  Sure it is.

There's more at issue here than what kind of genitive "working-class"
functions as, however.  What's important is neither that more working-class
individuals should write poetry, nor that more poetry should be written tha=
t
addresses working-class issues; what's important is that we learn to
acknowledge poetic practice in general as a social activity that is
inscribed by and in the larger context of class, race, economics, gender,
and all the other terms that add up to "awareness of the world we live in."
I think someone else said something similar to this in a recent post, but
maybe what we really ought to be concerning ourselves with is not
necessarily poetry _by_ or _about_ the working class, but _for_ the working
class.  "For" has its own overdetermined senses, of which I'll just hastily
point out two: "addressed to" (in which sense the problem becomes whether t=
o
change the vocabulary of the poetry or of the audience, and if the latter,
as seems preferable, does that have to be done outside of poetry first? no
doubt) and "dedicated to the cause of."

Just after writing this last part I stopped and checked my mail again and
saw Bill Austin's post.  Some overlap here, much more eloquent on Bill's
part.

This is brave of you, especially since said editor may be on POETICS.  I got
very embarrassed when I said something about a contest I didn't win and the
director of the press sponsoring it was on the list...  (and I didn't say I
should have won, I simply said something about the style of chapbook that
did win...)  So I think you are brave.  It would overwhelm the list and
possibly ruin it, but perhaps be a gesture of protest againsts the
difficulty of getting published in its own way, were people to
systematically post poems that were rejected from various journals.

If the quality of the poems posted was good enogh, one could even imagine an
anthology, REJECTS, in which the poems would have headings like "Rejected by
Shiny" and then the poem's title and author.  The poems would have to have
been rejected by sufficiently high quality journals to be accepted by
REJECTS, and of course REJECTS could reject poems, too-- it would be a
journal of the highest quality rejects...  Then there could be an offshoot,
Rejected by REJECTS, which would be photocopied badly on yellow paper and
would  accept anything which met the criteria: it would print poems that
REJECTS rejected... :-)

There is in the US a journal called Blue Collar Review.  And there's some
really good poetry in it.

As I see it, working class poetry is two things; a) poetry that points
toward our common humanity, now and in terms of what we need to win
ourselves back from capital and, b) poetry about work.  Of course, the two
may be integrated.  But, the former need not come from "workers."  And,
perhaps, some of the latter may not. also.  But, it mostly does.  See Blue
Collar Review...good stuff.

Dear Friends,

I recently received a letter from a French editor and publisher of Editions
Gallimard/Poesie Gallimard asking me for assistance with a new translation of
the 1892 edition of Leaves of Grass.  This "new and brilliant" translation is
by French poet Jacques Darras.  They are looking for financial support in
order to "make the volume more easily accessible to young buyers".

What I am asking is if folks on the list could forward this notice to the
French departments and/or scholars at the university where you are employed,
or anyone who might be able or intesested in supporting, or at least
exploring this project.  Thank you in advance,

It always was all women years ago
Once in awhile maybe a young Marine

Every other word he said was "sir"
Probably a newlywed on top of that
You know he's going to win a car
Or bedroom suite
Not that the game is fixed but to be fair
I'm sure someone at CBS
Made lots of money figuring this out

The way they've got it now
All kinds of people get to come on down

clearly though, this question of "working class" or (as in my case
too) poverty class (and working class is, or used to be, that much
*closer* to same, no?---felt that way to yours truly, and i ended up
there for years as a result of factory lay-offs) touches a nerve,
judging by the outpouring of posts on this issue...

i would say said nerve is an experiential one, having to do (for a
change, and thankfully) with poets/writers discussing their
bread-earning locations and histories... some consider this vulgar, i
consider it vital... poets generally tend *not* to talk about same,
as (for one) their writings (as all of us know) all too often work at
some remove from the question of wage (or to put it another way:
your poem ain't likely to be optioned anytime soon, cultural/symbolic
capital aside)...

now of course one can "imagine" any number of experiential
realities---you needn't be a person of color to write about people of
color, you needn't be a woman to write about women---but empirically
speaking, i note that much of the upper-middle class is mum e.g. as
to entitlements... whereas one of the working-class attributes i most
cherish is/was the capacity for discussing cold hard cash, and
realities attending thereto... at least, in those working-class
communities i was raised in---yknow, the old postwar blue collar 3
bdrm house communities, rapidly receding (here in the u.s., at
least), about which i feel a profound ambivalence, i should say (just
to shorthand what would otherwise be a 100kb post)...

so we have, at the very least, an art-experience divide, and a
permeable one... and judging by the number of poems submitted to me
by students (e.g.) who are NOT of the working class, and who make all
sortsa assumptions about travel and the like (e.g., many of my
20-year old poets talk about their trips to europe in their poems...
huh?... trips to WHERE?), there is certainly something of a (tacit)
cross-pollination taking place in class terms between experience and
art (i.e., in this case, the new middleclass wanderjahr)... and not
only students neither...

here's an interesting tidbit:  one of my favorite poets and pals here
in town, jack collom, worked (as some of you know) for 20 years in
factories of one sort or another, on the hourly scale... now, both of
my parents were factory workers---but me, i've only ever worked in a
factory (summer employment aside) as a white-collar (salary)
engineer... jack tells me that his parents both held college degrees
(well, my mom was enrolled in u of grenoble prior to the war breaking
out, and my dad, a one-time shop steward, finished his high school
postwar with my mom's help)... interestingly, when we've talked labor
issues, i tend to hold (i think it's fair to say) to a somewhat more
strident collective bargaining (prole?) line (though jack isn't
against unions, either, he's just had more experience first-hand with
union abuses... of course i've had in my case---as a white collar
worker---to drive through picket lines with union guys pounding on
the hood of my car, some of which guys came from my neighborhood and
never experienced the poverty i experienced... and i've dealt as a
construction manager with more trade union corruption than i can
detail here... for another time perhaps)...

then of course there's the movement at e.g. boeing to unionize
"professional" workers (i'm only using the quotes b/c i don't wish to
denigrate "non-professional" folks)... and the perpetual talk of
unionizing the professoriat, private institutions incl. (which i for
one am entirely in favor of)...

anyway... here's an assertion:  i'm pretty sure i know when i'm
talking to someone for whom (you will pardon the essentialist cant) a
buck is a buck... but it's not always clear how said experiential
datum (if you will) figures into one's work... still, talk of
workplace, labor, and (if i may, a hidden but no less vital variable
here, given current publishing realities) manufacturing underwrites
or counterpoints much of the chatter i hear about what a poem (or
broadly, writing) is "supposed" to do... and if adjunct labor and
office work provides us with a more topical grasp of "working class"
(quotes again)---certainly the demographic is widespread and will in
time be wide-spread-er as far as office work goes---then i would say,
for one, the absence of collective bargaining in so many of these
latter workaday communities suggests that the new working classes in
the u.s. look to be something of a different beast altogether...

thanx to all for the discussion...

best,

well i feel obliged to add this to my last post:  the ideological
realities of the u.s. and elsewhere might be such that they rely on
damaging stereotypes, which such & so people  then feel obliged to
'live up to'... this argument gets made all the time in discussions
of race and ethnicity... e.g., in terms of class, if working class =
brash, then i might feel obliged to act brashly...

but this view negates for me a certain level of agency... i.e., my
brashness may not be any more or less "natural" than the absence of
same, may in fact constitute something of a survival strategy of its
own accord, and not something 'contained by' superstructure as such...

now how and why and to what ends one may elect to represent such
experiences/behaviors/what have you in one's work---even whether
representation is the point here (i.e., in light of the entire range
of possible aesthetic responses, incl. the so-called
non-representational)---well, even to ask this question may be to
presume that, aside from matters of sheer expressiveness and the
desire thereof, art (term used advisedly) has something to do with
social or communal efficacy... changing the conditions of labor (read
as injustice) through textual awareness?... if this isn't too
agitprop a way of putting things...

sometimes, i might add, i imagine mself as contributing to such
changes, idealist (or social realist?) that i am...

of course it's difficult to imagine that art can resist or effect or
even react with any demonstrable efficacy to something as broad as
the social when one's work is (imagined to be) read by, say, a dozen
people... such singularities (if you will) seem somewhat displaced by
the symptomatic pulls and pushes of kultur (incl. my dear old pop
culture)... so to argue somewhat against the grain of those smaller
currents of production and consumption that i so value and so believe
in and so put a measure of faith in (b/c i feel like being brash at
the moment):  if one's reading public is a dozen people, what does
this say about the possibilities of the/a public sphere?... and i
trust this question doesn't land us too far afield of class issues
per se...

best,

joe

Hey this is true enough as a statement about white american poets but
breaks down internationally and racially.

E.g. here in san francisco there has been a very queer spoken word
scene that is working class and white. Not much interest in theory.
the (white) working class dyke scene in my experience is suspicious
of theory, it can arouse real anger. After one itty-bitty presentation
with a knotted up chunk of theory in the middle a woman I actually
know came up and blasted me, what the F**K were you talking about!!?!

Lately Tisa Bryant and I at New Langton Arts have been putting together
a series Diaspora Poetics locating radical experimentation ELSEWHERE.
Communities of exile, immigration, diaspora. This is one hell of rich
vein of experimental work!! It just does not follow the paradigm of
white trust fund babies toying with abstraction. WHY.

Perhaps it's a political problem, not a literary one. There's been a lot of
anti-colonial anti-imperialist theoretical work (e.g. Said) which
has been hella useful to people coming to consciousness about the
political forces that locate them in their lives. The white (american)
working class has not been gotten such persuasive and transformative
analyses. WHY NOT.

Hello everyone, I really appreciate Dodie Bellamy's very lucid response of
Fri 3/1 to this discussion. I wanted to add to her comments that I think
class origin is not only something that can be "rid of" during one lifetime,
but also something that plays out over multiple generations. I've heard
things from people of many different class origins that make me think this
is true.

Well, I would argue that the new proles, to be distinguished from the
proletariat, are the replaceable or unnecessary knowledge workers.  I am
separating proles from the other classes by knowledge and "awareness" or
perhaps affection for culture. The new working class is pretty much the old
working class, as previously noted -- though there are fewer workers who do
not use computers:

lan tech a might be a middle class knowledge worker writing genre fiction as
a hobby
lan tech b might be a prole concerned with this afternoon's sandwich
lan tech c's parents worked in factories in Asia, and is finishing grad
school at night
and
lan tech d might be a poet with "a day job in high tech"

the job is the same; like the disappearance of inherited money or just money
as a marker, job description / collar color is disappearing as a marker of
class -- though I consider corporate and academic dress codes to be
class-based sumptuary laws; community college adjuncts are unionized here --
I would argue that this does not make them working class (although I do
think most knowledge workers should unionize).

I am confident the lan techs would not present comparable writing.

Some experiences or ways of experience have qualities which elude
classification.  I think that it is interesting that formalist Paul Fussell
created his social class quiz around cultural markers, and it is these that
cheat the quiz.

Weren't Percy Bysshe Shelley's poetics political, and tied to Mary Shelley's
father's ideas about social welfare?

Oh but Kasey my dear! I would also watch the romanticization in the other
direction. Certainly esoteric knowledge of life and how to live it well has

Bill, I think you nailed here a very important question. Your post points to the most serious problem with LangPo: it was good at reflective tactics at best. Since its concern is with language itself, there obviously can be no escape plan. A true postmodernist would not touch one with a lightning rod, right? Them ideas are dangerous, and ideologies are rotten altogether. Modernists, supposedly, compromised any possibility of an escape plan by: a) being overly enthusiastic about industrial/social revolution; and/or by b) mixing up with the totalitatian crowd (fascists/communists, etc).

Well, so the thinking went, at least mine, for awhile. But for me, personally, as I am sure, for you, Bill, this line of thought looks more and more problematic. One Modernist/Avant-Gardist I find the most relevent to this discussion is Velimir Khlebnikov. He towers over the late 20-century avant-garde, and dwarfs it, too. Khlebnikov's ability to fuse radical textual politics with ability to be prophetic in his outcry against upcoming dehumanization of the 20 c. (in his earliest writing, before 1910), and his constructive outlook contrasts sharply with Langpo's separation of radical formalism from human self. Only now we are catching up with his "utopian" eurasian and terrian ideas. And reading Khlebnikov, I realized something else: WE, THE POETS OF THE 21 CENTURY ARE NOT POST-ANYTHING, either modernist, postmodernist, or langpo (i am post-myparents, and you are post-your's, so what?).
It's a clean slate. We should not be afraid of bigger ideas, and human self is not leaving any time soon.
We should be dreaming bigger human dreams, not robot protocols. Marxism, Derrida and the rest of the 20c. cannon goes back to the library. Theory should put a helmet on and go back to the drawing board.
The sign is going up:
THIS AGE IS UNDER CONSRUCTION.


As for the  whole misguided working-class poet discussion: ff we get back to the spirit of humanity, if we concern ourselves about how to better integrate our alien civilization with this planet, absurdity of our drive to check out each other's proletarian credentials will become obvious.

Best,
Igor Satanovsky

And ideology is, of course, the problem.  When has the working class, however
current their characterization, not been at the mercy of ideologues?  Putting
aside for the moment that mimetic gestures are possible only as semiotic
play, the notion that all "representational" language serves
corportate/capitalist agendas is itself suspect.  On the one hand, we
understand how bombarded we are by information controlled and delivered by
corporate agencies.  A good chunk of the language has most certainly been
co-opted by commercial interests.  But does the avant-garde as it is lately
understood, i.e., as radical formalism, constitute a serious reaction to
dehumanization, an escape plan, or does it merely reinforce the bars?  The
technology required for much avant-garde production is corporate initiated
and owned, and is well situated within the monied class.  So if the argument
against representation includes some notion of dispensing with the tools of
capitalism, e.g., the self, mimetic language, etc., then we may be in an even
worse fix if we exchange those "traditions" for an artistic technocracy.  In
such a case artists may become less and less relevant, if that's possible.
Is there much difference between a conventional love poem's resting upon a
bourgeois/romantic idea of self cum dust bowl idealization, and any
"avant-garde" production that reminds us up front of the textualized self in
a room full of working class computer drones?  Is it possible that corporate
dominion might actually prefer the latter?  Surely we are all familiar with
the capitalist mindset that swallows everything with a shrug, with a "I don't
know what it means, but I can buy and sell it."  That mindset, it seems,
fears only those things it finds meaningful, the challenge it understands.
I don't know the answers, of course.  But it does seem common sensical that
if we care for the exploited, we'll want to communicate with them, and with
ourselves since most of us are exploited.  That means going to them, and in a
language they understand, without sacrificing formal integrity.  A tall
order.  But I do consider that is how the future calls to us.  Ideologies are
certainly interesting, usually dangerous.  But perhaps we have forgotten,
those among us who feel utterly isolated and "meaningless," that people are
more important than art.  Best, Bill

Nonsense. What you call theocratic fascism is  another  "spear" in the
world-wide class struggle and the Other is now not Mao Tse Tung etc but the
El Qaeda and others in Palestine or South America taking on the immense and
terrible force of the US Military that the American people havent it seems
the courage to protest against. And its poets are weak-minded: no leadership
there...
   And those forces, and they are never "unflawed",  are proving just now -
9 US dead 40 wounded - that "revolution is not a tea party". I think you've
gone soft. The 70s may have been a giggle for you with your drugs - I was
there too but I was opposed to illegal drugs (still am) wheras one of the
major reasons the US is in Afghanistan is to free up the drug money - but
there are people suffering throughout the world because of the continous
(since the Second WW) incursions and military operations by the West and in
particular the US Imperialists: the globalisation movement needs to link up
with more radical Moslems etc and others with the courage to take action
against capitalism and its corruption: and the present hysteria generated by
the Republicans and extreme right wing elements who are slowly moving the US
toward being the biggest terrorist nation on the Earth: probably now the
most (rightly) hated nation with its hypocritical talk of democracy (when
they always back the most undemocratic regimes).Soon your "rights" will be
only for people with  big money...if that isnt the case already. If you cant
tolerate other countries with their own religions or theocracy that is
intolerance and racialism: the US needs urgently to pull out of all
countries outside its own borders. that way it might survive but it is now
on the bieginning of the doom predicted by Mao tse Tung: stewing in its own
corruption, violence, and greed and its exploitaion and brutality to other
nations while the rich "middle class" in the West are on a pigs back. Get
real. Leave other people alone! Let them find there own way. Keep out
America! Richard.

Very interesting discussion.  A couple comments,
neither of which are meant to take away in ANY WAY
from the genuine and totally neccessary work of
working class poets (someone said that class is the
invisible oppressor in this country, that even more
than race or gender, we are still very much in denial
about it and all its ramifications, and I think this
may be true, at least in art...):
1)  I find it funny/odd/problematic/cool that there
seems to be a trend of poets listing all their
"working class" jobs in their bio notes when they are
published in Big Journals: "Poet X has worked as a
dishwasher, ditch digger, welder, etc. and is now
teaching at X University."  Has anyone else noticed
this "trend"?  And isn't this true for many of us who
are middle-class?  I, for instance, worked as a
cashier, nanny, data entry clerk, etc.  And yes, this
informs my poetics, certainly, but what is to be
gained/lossed from mentioning it, since I now have
health care and an academic (non-secure) job?
2)   Not to cop any pity or anything, but I am
wondering if anyone else feels, along the lines of
what Elizabeth was saying about generational class
fallout, the pressures of a working class mentality on
their middle class lives.  I am fourth generation
American, but my Jewish family, which has been middle
class for at least two generations (my grandparents
worked and GI'ed their way thru college), still acts
out working class anxieties.  My father is a college
professor, but my parents bought generic brand food,
never went out to eat, yelled at us for leaving the
fridge door open, etc.--it's like no matter how
"comfortable" we actually were, we couldn't act like
it.  I am sure that after a certain point in my
childhood, we were never really living paycheck to
paycheck (although it was scary when my dad was denied
tenure for the first time), but my parents sure made
it seem like we did, and I grew up highly anxious
about money and never feeling like I had anything in
common with the kids in my (upper-middle-class)
neighborhood, whose jeans were Jordache, not Salvation
Army or Sears like mine.  I feel like this was an
ethnic thing, too, although all my Jewish friends
definitely had the designer jeans (genes?).

Just complicating an already complicated issue,
cheerfully!  (Please don't flame me...I have the flu
and can't bear it right now...)

For some years, I followed a practice of posting poems that had been rejected by
magazines in other magazines -- There was that one delightful time, too, when
the editor of a magazine came up to me at a reading to tell me how much she
loved one of the poems I'd read and to ask me to let her publish it.  I didn't
remind her that she'd rejected the same poem two years earlier.  Back in the
70s, Coach House Press published an anthology containing one poem by each poet
whose book ms. they'd been unable to publish.  It was a quite good book if
memory serves.  I've found that my work does get out eventually, but it sure
tends to accumulate in the mean time, and it is such a mean time . . .

Of Coin


On a phenomenological level, we live within the horizon of universal caus-
ation, stochastic phenomena notwithstanding. Origins are given as such
because they appear determined; the truth of the matter, however - the
_truth of matter_ - is that causation is problematic; as cosmology app-
roaches t(0), it becomes more and more dubious - paralleling the breakdown
of spacetime in the small. Our worlds, perceptions, are residues at best.
We shall find nothing at the origin, no function, null - not even annihil-
ation.

We live within the horizon of universal apocalypse, local organization
notwithstanding. Azure and I cuddle together; we are co-dependent, having
these few moments before worlds collapse. The imminent destruction of life

Subject:      John Wiener and the Working Class poet
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

In 1966, I think it was, there was a great reading on
campus at Berkeley, called (I think) the "San
Francisco Poetry Rennaisance". (If I'm wrong one of
you will set it right. )  Being the only one of my
poetry-loving circle with a job, I couldn't be there
for the whole thing.I did arrive in time to hear John
Wiener though.
Standing in the back of the theater with Tuli
Kupferburg, who, with the Fugs, was there for the
event, I saw the dissheveled figure holding his untidy
handful of poems,hypnotize the audience. He seemed so
vulnerable and so focused.  Didn't care about audience
response, didn't read for that, but seemed to be
addressing a private spectre, and we all felt
privileged to be allowed to eavesdrop on this private
transaction.

Back in the 20s and 30s of the 20th century, there
existed a concept no one seems familiar with now: the
working class intellectual. This person was
self-educated with the help of the public library and
the numerous public offerings available then through
labor unions, schools like Cooper Union in New York,
and others. This worker read poetry, often memorized
it for the amusement of hi/her friends and family.
This was the era of memorization in school too, and my
parents learned many, many poems by heart while they
were still in school.
Recognizing complexity of form does not seem to me to
be a prerequisite for appreciating poetry.  In fact,
it seems to me, that if form intrudes on the message
of the poem,it loses some of it's power.
You may ridicule the poetry of Kipling and Vachel
Linsay,but there was and there remains a
class-consciousness in it that moved working men and
women of my parents generation, and made them believe
that poetry could be telling their story. Vachel
Lindsay traveled from town to town and recited his
work, sometimes, for dinner.
 I have read with growing alarm the dialogue about
"working class poets" these last few days. It appears
that this predominantly academic list really believes
that working class poets are some quaint, agit-prop
writing, bunch of cretins. Some of you are clearly
victims of the agit-propaganda of people like Clifford
Odettes,who wrote characters, portrayed by the
beautiful John Garfield in numerous 30s and 40s films,
the working class guy who wanted to play the violin
but ended up prize-fighting to support the family..

The power of the poem transcends style and form. Ron
Silliman, who has challenged form from a working-class
perspective,is always accessable. I read him first
without any understanding of what "lang po" was. I
undertook to learn about it because of him. I still
think his work is in a class by itself. Sooner or
later he will give us the last word here.

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents:

An evening reading with
ED FRIEDMAN & ANGE MLINKO

Thursday March 7, 7:30 pm,
$7 donation
@ The Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

ED FRIEDMAN has three new publications out this past year--Away, a limited
edition collaboration with visual artist Robert Kushner (Granary Books),
Drive Through the Blue Cylinders (Hanging Loose), and The Funeral Journal
(Jensen/Daniels), which is a section from Space Stations, a journal he's
been writing since 1979.  Re his earlier book Mao & Matisse, Murat
Nemet-Nejat noted a poetry "exquisitely attuned to this historical moment.
Its texture embodies the cultural minutiae of its time and its issues.  Its
easy transparence crackles with them."  Ed Friedman grew up in Los Angeles,
and he lives in New York City, where he's Director of The Poetry Project at
St. Marks Church.

Mao & Matisse

Matisse was no hedonist.  He articulated ideas with pleasure.
Same with Mao, only he had a Long March.
Since he couldn't afford new fruit each day for his still life
Matisse painted in a studio with no heat and the windows open.
The point being what?
Two legends of the 20th century
having almost nothing to do with each other.
One can shape a revolution for several billion people that in a
million tangible ways each day makes life better.  Or you can
paint paintings, some good, some bad and some great, that
when people see them they'll remember that life is terrific to
look at and re-invent in each moment with magnificent shape
and color.  Wouldn't Mao have loved an Henri Matisse there in
his headquarters as he planned the final assault on Chiang
Kai-shek's reactionary regime?  Wouldn't Henri Matisse have
reveled in the discipline of the People's Revolutionary Army?
Probably not.  Unless of course I was there to explain it to them.
"Mao? Henri? Isn't this an inspired moment of history?"

-Ed Friedman

ANGE MLINKO's book Matin=E9es (Zoland) was reviewed by William Corbett:  "To
my parent's generation a matinee meant sex in the afternoon.  The sex in
Matin=E9es is between Mlinko and language, and the poems are gratified like
Lucky Pierre.  They have that rosy look of delight; they take joy and give
it. . . . Her work has two qualities that cannot be faked, a sense of humor
and life itself."  Ange Mlinko moved from Boston to New York City, where
she edits The Poetry Project Newsletter.

Immediate Orgy and Audit

I turn off their songs to hear my song hearing nothing I wait,
nothing rings in my answering nor a motorcycle bee
do I hear, the heart, sound of action in nothingness:
my direst circumstance derived from affection.
All songs refigured in your likeness,
odelike indigenous, a sudden use for silk
but none for justice, just to suddenly
flummox you into my powers
ever derived from being a lover.
A dire circumstance
if a mouth be sickled by a kiss
or hearts can stop if by crashing
think of a helmet for it, using words.

-Ange Mlinko

Richard,

But a poet absolutely owns his or her means of production --for a "product"
which essentially nobody wants. How do you deal with that?

A very perceptive observation. For instance, in Turkey, some people who used
to be leftists before the fall of the Soviet Union have because Islamists,
essentially because in the Third World it is the major organized dissent
against the United States.

It seems to me here Kasey is raising a point not raised before in this
discussion. Is class determined by the background of the writer or whom the
author is writing for or addressing. For instance, is there more of
Micaelangelo's background in the Sistine Chapel or the taste of the Pope and
Catholic theology?

Does who writes or who pays for it which determines class? What about poetry,
where essentially nobody "pays" anything?

Me too. I think illegal medical marijuana really sucks. If the Federal
level allowed legal medical marijuana, a lot of very badly off people
could be greatly helped.

It would be nice if there were legal psychedelics, too, at the very
least legal E, because then rave kids could be sure of what they're
getting in every pill without having to send them to dancesafe.com, and
for that matter, legal opiates would help users titrate the appropriate
dose to maintain themselves, rather than getting a too-weak or
dangerously too strong shot.

It's called harm reduction, hun. The possible, here and now.

Joe,

I think you are raising a crucial issue. If art (specifically poetry) is not
economically viable, then how can a poem be seen as a "product" in the
economic cycle? Is a poet a "producer? What is a poet's class structure, as a
poet, in the cycle of production?

Arrr, Elizabeth me darlin'--but esoteric is the key term here.  Bourgeois
ethical innovations are unique in their ambitious scope and systematization.
  They are like very powerful vaccines made in a high-tech lab, whereas the
other life-knowledge-approaches you mention are like occasionally quite
effective folk remedies.  What, me romanticize?  It's not that there's
something _inherently_ "better" about bourgeois ethics, as opposed to
esoteric ethics; it's just that they have the most funding and snappiest ad
campaign, and thus stand the greater chance of mass proliferation and
acceptance.  Unfortunately, of course, other less desirable things keep
(shudder) proliferating as well and interfering with the process (sometimes
inextricably mixed in with the ethics themselves).

Bill, I think you nailed here a very important question. Your post points to
the most serious problem with LangPo: it was good at reflective tactics at
best. Since its concern is with language itself, there obviously can be no
escape plan. A true postmodernist would not touch one with a lightning rod,
right? Them ideas are dangerous, and ideologies are rotten altogether.
Modernists, supposedly, compromised any possibility of an escape plan by: a)
being overly enthusiastic about industrial/social revolution; and/or by b)
mixing up with the totalitatian crowd (fascists/communists, etc).


Well, so the thinking went, at least mine, for awhile. But for me,
personally, as I am sure, for you, Bill, this line of thought looks more and
more problematic. One Modernist/Avant-Gardist I find the most relevent to
this discussion is Velimir Khlebnikov. He towers over the late 20-century
avant-garde, and dwarfs it, too. Khlebnikov's ability to fuse radical textual
politics with ability to be prophetic in his outcry against upcoming
dehumanization of the 20 c. (in his earliest writing, before 1910), and his
constructive outlook contrasts sharply with Langpo's separation of radical
formalism from human self. Only now we are catching up with his "utopian"
eurasian and terrian ideas. And reading Khlebnikov, I realized something
else: WE, THE POETS OF THE 21 CENTURY ARE NOT POST-ANYTHING, either
modernist, postmodernist, or langpo (i am post-myparents, and you are
post-your's, so what?).

It's a clean slate. We should not be afraid of bigger ideas, and human self
is not leaving any time soon.

We should be dreaming bigger human dreams, not robot protocols. Marxism,
Derrida and the rest of the 20c. cannon goes back to the library. Theory
should put a helmet on and go back to the drawing board.

The sign is going up:

THIS AGE IS UNDER CONSRUCTION.



As for the  whole misguided working-class poet discussion: ff we get back to
the spirit of humanity, if we concern ourselves about how to better integrate
our alien civilization with this planet, absurdity of our drive to check out
each other's proletarian credentials will become obvious.


Best,

Igor Satanovsky

________


And ideology is, of course, the problem.  When has the working class, however

current their characterization, not been at the mercy of ideologues?  Putting

aside for the moment that mimetic gestures are possible only as semiotic

play, the notion that all "representational" language serves

corportate/capitalist agendas is itself suspect.  On the one hand, we

understand how bombarded we are by information controlled and delivered by

corporate agencies.  A good chunk of the language has most certainly been

co-opted by commercial interests.  But does the avant-garde as it is lately

understood, i.e., as radical formalism, constitute a serious reaction to

dehumanization, an escape plan, or does it merely reinforce the bars?  The

technology required for much avant-garde production is corporate initiated

and owned, and is well situated within the monied class.  So if the argument

against representation includes some notion of dispensing with the tools of

capitalism, e.g., the self, mimetic language, etc., then we may be in an even

worse fix if we exchange those "traditions" for an artistic technocracy.  In

such a case artists may become less and less relevant, if that's possible.

Is there much difference between a conventional love poem's resting upon a

bourgeois/romantic idea of self cum dust bowl idealization, and any

"avant-garde" production that reminds us up front of the textualized self in

a room full of working class computer drones?  Is it possible that corporate

dominion might actually prefer the latter?  Surely we are all familiar with

the capitalist mindset that swallows everything with a shrug, with a "I don't

know what it means, but I can buy and sell it."  That mindset, it seems,

fears only those things it finds meaningful, the challenge it understands.

I don't know the answers, of course.  But it does seem common sensical that

if we care for the exploited, we'll want to communicate with them, and with

ourselves since most of us are exploited.  That means going to them, and in a

language they understand, without sacrificing formal integrity.  A tall

order.  But I do consider that is how the future calls to us.  Ideologies are

certainly interesting, usually dangerous.  But perhaps we have forgotten,

those among us who feel utterly isolated and "meaningless," that people are

more important than art.  Best, Bill

 >>

Eureka!!  Someone who is on the money, uh, on point.  You have my humble yay
re:  the post biz.  To be post anything immediately references the commercial
success of the prepost.  Langpo was innovative "for its time", no doubt about
it, a reaction to a Romanticism that had once again become slushy, though we
all know the strategy is an old one.  And there has often obtained a link,
however firm or tenuous, given this or that geographic and/or chronological
contextualization, between the avant-garde and the totalitarian impulse.  Big
time with the Italian Futurists, for example.  But not so with the New York
School.  Langpo as it is characterized in more than one supporting essay, is
clearly an "other-path" around the self's limited movement through
space-time, a projection of space/time itself, curved, reflexive,  infinite,
eternal, delimited -- absolute.  But with the self's limitations goes
individuality.  Dispensing with the self as poetic locus reflects the
co-extensive demonization of the individual, how s/he thinks, what s/he
"feels," that is so pervasive in our current cultural climate.  Consider,
briefly, the clubbiness of so many online journals.  The editorial
"guidelines" are far more firmly defined then those of most "traditional"
literary organs.  This is precisely what the corporate bastards want, what
the right wing wants -- team players, Proletariat yes men, textualizations
and no voices, i.e., the masses.  And we are left with little more than
clonework, art that reflects our own sense of powerlessness, of
meaninglessness.  And that's just sad, especially in a world that is crying
for self-initiated courage and intelligence.

Derrida never wanted this defeat.  The poetry is Derrida's own writing, a
self-a-drome if there ever was one.  Derrida's project was to examine
language, to show us how it actually functioned, not to strip it of its most
profound and brilliant creation, the self.  If anything, he celebrated the
self, gave us all another reason to pay tribute to it.  How can anyone read
The Post Card and think otherwise?  How can anyone read that book and come
away with a prescription to de-sensitize our texts, to replace feeling with
the clever and witty.  He was, and is, an arch Romantic, well aware of the
tragedy Keats' nightingale signals, the ever retreating logos, center,
source, "god" -- that absence which is our humanity, our comedy, our tragedy.
 To sidestep this is, as you say, to dream in very small quantities.  I'm not
sure we will never dispense with Derrida any more than with Plato and
Aristotle, not because of Derrida's theory, but because of his poetry.  But
Derrida's theorizing follows poetry, as it should be, as he meant it to be,
and not the other way around.  I'm with you.  Let's begin again, and again,
and again.  And if we must reach backwards for inspiration, well, who hasn't?
 And let the machines, old and new, follow us.   Khlebnikov is amazing.  An
innovator with a loud voice.  Power, baby.  A Visionist!  Viva the poets!
Best, Bill

The "good old days" are still here, Ron--

when Isabelle and I drove Brian Kim Stefans and Miles Champion over the
border, a couple of years back, to enjoy the more "middle class" route to
the Falls (pleasant landscaped Canadian parkway, as opposed to the thruway
past "working class" power plants, factories and Love Canal on the American
side), we were abusively sent to customs, and our 1984 Volvo station wagon
(used to haul steel for welding projects so I don't know if that's "working
class" or "middle class") virtually dismantled.

At one point, I see the customs agent pull out a small cloth bag from the
glove compartment and walk triumphantly into the one-way glassed office,
cradling it in his surgically gloved hand.  "Uh oh," I think, "the dope we
couldn't find."  (Again, I don't know whether getting high is a "working
class" or an exclusively "middle class" predilection.)  The agent exits
smiling, after a couple of minutes, to ask Isabelle, "can you tell me,
ma'am, what this is?"  "Oh," she laughs, "those are bath salts; they're
lovely-- would you like to smell them?"  Definitely "middle class" . . .
Our "working class" border agent naturally declined, and sent us on our way.

Somehow, class, I suspect, mattered less, here, than the fact I was
chauffeuring one Asian-American, one Brit, & one French, with New Mexico
plates to boot . . .

Just last week Nate Dorward, who rode down from Toronto on Greyhound
("working class" style, though his actual social provenance I am unaware of)
to hear the substantially "working class" Tom Raworth (Brit poet working his
US reading circuit for the rent check) read some poems-- to a bunch of
"middle class" UB Poetics students (read debt-ridden TAs)-- was grilled
extensively, and somewhat rudely, by the "Peace Bridge" customs agent
(apparently, regardless of class), as soon as Nate avowed his reason for
crossing was a "poetry reading."

Perhaps, as the "good old days" keep on rolling (as in, "let's roll"), we
might ask the question of borders.  And why and how, and with what varying
degrees of trouble, poetry crosses these . . .

It's interesting, disquietig, the way this topic
perennially re-erupts here on the Buffalo List . . .
but somewhat sad or regretable, too, how little the
community has learned in the meantime, nor advanced a
poetry/poetics that better reconciles these anxieties.

Kathy Lou Schultz was being quite helpful and
on-target by pointing toward the discussion to the
HOW2 Class and Innovative Writing Forum, generously
re-printed in Lipstick Eleven No. 2,--- because that
collection represented the outcome of the last major
eruption of excited discussion about working
class/class here on the List.  The most frightening
self-fulfilling prophecies in that Forum that I have
had to watch breathing down my neck was Catherine
Rankovic's, re-printed opposite mine in Lipstick:

"The working-class poet almost always ends as a writer
of prose",

"a lot of production of writing (as in journaling) but
no publication".

And the discussion of a few years ago and the current
discussion are both marked by many of the same
rhetorical reactions: a reversion into
semi-apologetic, autobiographical, anecdotal
"confessions" about one's origins; and a great deal of
muddle about the terms involved . . . or what the heck
anybody's talking about (further demonstration, as the
former Soviets used to testify, that "capitalist"
America keeps the public ignorant and unclear about
ideological standards).

These recurrences of the same, inconclusive melee of
discussion this round make me wonder if there isn't a
different, more psychological sub-stratum to it:

The Return of The Repressed.

Clearly, there are ways that the modes of poetry that
are dominant among the School of Buffalo affiliates
--- disjunctive/asyntactical, "anti-'I'", etc. ---
interferes with or precludes any self-evident progress
in this direction.  (Otherwise, now x-many years after
the previous Forum it would be easier and more readily
at hand to point to examples that have reconciled
these problems.)  And yet, by being largely
liberal/leftist, we maintain some sense of allegiance
to the working class as a ~cause celebre,~ that we
~should~ be better attuned to "the working class," no
matter how absurdistly contradictory the manifest
evidence within the poetics itself.

Is it some type of guilt (?) that here we harbor these
Union politics of a collective and we oppose extreme
seductions and coercions by financial power, and yet
our poetry has not advanced a small step toward
closing the gap between literary elitism and those
unindoctrinated to poetry?

The anxiety, too, is that, despite denials, clearly,
treatment of class issues requires some greater
recourse to "discursivity" or referentiality than the
School of Buffalo is open to.  The fastest way to
either bridge the gap of class/ideological
obliviousness or betray oneself is through some signal
of ~vocabulary~ (referentiality).  The alternative
that I airily tried to point to in the Forum is an
innovative poetry that would accentuate a
labor-intensiveness in its making

(...but that's aready accomplished by New Formalism).

A key distinction that's being omitted so far here, I
believe, is

the difference between the class determinants that are
imprinted upon a person, upon us, by our upbringing
(the late Bourdieu's "habitus"), that is, the mark of
the real,

versus

the chimera that self is--- and how identity, although
constructed, equally draws upon *fantasia* and desire,

and is not solely stamped by the effects of the real.

What I mean is,

regardless of the influence that actual circumstances,
education, and money had on anyone's personality
development, personality is just as much fed, at this
point, by media.  ...So that a person latches onto
(cathects onto) images and representations in the
media, within experience, that confirm and affirm some
phantasmatic interior sense of self.

Thus, the upper class girl who hands out International
Socialist Organization (ISO) newspapers on street
corners,

or the "working class" adult (consigned to continue
earning due to a doomed lack of savings/capital) whose
poetry is acted out like some Sebastian Venable in a
white suit (the poet hero in Tennessee William's
~Suddenly Last Summer~).

You're not only where you've been and what's been done
to you.  Personality formation ~interprets~ the
constrictions it meet.

To complete the equation of the biographical that
keeps coming up here, the formula should be finished:
my parents came from such-and-such a background and
they treated financial/work matters in such-and-such a
way,

~and~ independent of that

these are the works in the media, literature and the
arts that I found myself responsive to and integrated.

To join in on this thrilling pecadillo of talking
about oneself:

In high school, I began checking out of the school
library record albums of classical music.  But there
was absolutely ~no~ classical music anywhere in my
environment.

At most, if people's tastes in music went between Top
40, in New Jersey, then they were fans of Broadway
musicals.

Wait.

There was one boxed set of Reader's Digest Immortal
Music that my parents must've gotten through some Book
of the Month club, that no one but I ever listened to.
 Out of that, the old chestnut of Debussy's ~Clair de
Lune~ eventually lead, once free and on my own in The
Big City, to Debussy's ~Pelleas et Melissande.~  And
deeper and deeper, more and more extensive investment
into listening broadened into competitively
sophisticated tastes: this week, Morton Feldman and
Schnittke CDs; last Wednesday, a (free! for the
working class) Manhattan School of Music concert of
Shostakovich, this Wednesday, a ticket to hear David
Daniels sing Berlioz's ~Nuits d'Ete'~ with the New
York Philharmonic.

But, my point: ~nothing~ in the class environment I
originally grew up in determined or could have
prognosticated this development.

Is it innate sensitivity?

Becoming a poet is quite similar.  There is probably
~nowhere~ in America that the atmosphere is hospitable
enough to poetry to encourage someone going into it as
a central pursuit.  And yet--- we've grown into this
most unlikely and class-nebulous of callings.

Can the absence of class/employment-identifying
information in School of Buffalo be attributed to the
possibility that, when we are writing poetry, we are
indulging our leisure class fantasias?

It's extremely unclear, almost off-limits, how better
known poets survive economically, cobbling together
some sort of odd conglomeration of adjunct teaching,
grants, and frugality.  The vagueness of the
economic/class status of poet ~as an
occupation/avocation,~ as opposed to, say, ballerinas
or rock-&-roll, where the class connotations are
definite, may have something to do with why we enter
into it, and how it remains such an unresolveable
topic amongst ourselves.

Poetry may be a very rare case that, stereotypically,
has broken with class and financial designations.
Hypothesis?: We're all stepping outside of our class,
no matter which class that might be, whenever we're
"in poetry,"--- because poetry effectively ~has no~
class definition.  (The temptation is to think of it
as leisure class, . . . but to the leisure class
themselves, it can still seem as roustabout as Allen
Ginsberg hippydom.)

One other autobiographical lapse:

My brother is a magician.

He broke from the different employment grooves he was,
determined to make his living as a professional
magician, and he's done that be it stage magician with
rabbit and top hat or psychic with fortune-telling
cards in a cafe.

The two seem of the same world, poet and magician.

To be driven to become a poet is like becoming
(Carlyle) a priest, . . . or a winged horse.  The only
actual endeavor I find it consistently comparable to
is chess, which has famous, astronomical international
tournament heights and impractical park bench hobbyist
lows.

I guess where I've meandered here is that poetry, like
few other activities, has fallen outside the class
narratives of our culture.  It effectively is ~not~ an
option on any career counselor or high school guidance
counselor's menu.  It's like becoming Wiccan.

Joe. I agree with a lot you have here: but I wouldnt knock unions (I'm
leaving sex out of this until the end!!)...there are corrupt unions
everywhere: unions arent the answer but they have been and are or can be a
major force for workers: but here in NZ when in 1973 I was in a paint
factory the head of our Union (who later became very rich - he started off
in working class Panmure where I am now) was the head of several others: the
workers wanted better pay and safety (there is always a big danger there in
a paint factory and many others)...the workers wanted these things but the
Union tried to damp things down. Now that doesnt mean that the concept or
even the practice of unions is finished: that's bullshit (dont worry I'm not
on the attack against you and Ron I'm just on about certain sections,
certain practices and certain sectors of the state,and certain things i'm
"angry " about (I'm never angry really) and I can understand Ron's point of
view re theocratic fascism etc but cant go into all that now)...unions still
are needed to assist the wage and conditions of workers: here (probably in
the US too) they've tried to smash the unions (read terrorise them so the
"fat cats" get bigger profits because strikes are illegal -next they'll be
using Mafia types even here- or they try to make them so...) ..but what
you're saying re talking cash -hard cash - has some truth and also about
openness: but we dont have to be: trapped" in a class forever: its true that
_in general_ we'll detect certain falsities coming from "rich" people: but
there are many good idealistic ad motivated people who are NOT from
so-called working class ... read middle class and upper of the working class
proper (where  w/c is everyone (mostly) _not_ in ownership of the means of
production)...but the truth is we need all kinds of people: in 1995 when
Robert Creeley was here he lectured ( he gave a lot of readings of such as
Ed Dorn, Olson, Berrigan, Wieners and others) he mentioned that Ed Dorn
(sadly another one deceased fairly recently) had been very much working
class and one day realised he was getting on too  much for the heavy work
loading trucks or whatever he was doing and then got into the academic
world..another example would be Peter Reading in England.....but its a truth
that somewhat there is an experiental divide: but some people are so forced
down into poverty and hence into crime they seem to lose all sensiblity or
conscience: but that's another complex worm can.....I could never afford to
go to Europe per se (although I might have done but the kind of O.E. you
refer to is out of the range of most poorer working class people..they're
lucky to make one trip in their life to one country outside their own)....in
fact the cultural revolution in China was in part an attempt to bridge that
experiential hiatus: it doesnt matter what the motives or outcome were: that
was its stated intention or the perceived concept of it....working for years
in factories and so on didnt harm me and was never really hardship (as I was
a young man), nor do I know if I learnt anything, or if my inability to get
into a white-collar job wasnt simply a failure of nerve on my part: some
so-called white collar jobs take more initiative and courage to "get
into"...and so on.... but certainly it gave me some insights....but the type
of poetry I like is often very "un-working class"....I get frustrated and
"angry"  with "difficult" writers but I prefer them to eg Bukowski or Adrian
Henri, Roger McGough, Brian Patten...or more correctly, those guys are great
poets but I also want to "get into" Ashbery, even Merrill, the New York
poets,Wieners, various European,the Langpos, Geoffrey Hill and many
others.....its not a them and us: maybe someone such as Joyce Carol Oates
(an intellectual from a working class background) is thus so marvellously
equipt to write her lovecraftingly crafted short stories, "You Must Remember
This" _fantastically realistic_ descriptions of boxing and violence, and the
almost magic-realist "BellFleur" which is a excrucialtingly brilliant: I
preferred it to  Marquez's 100 Years (although that was fantastic))....but
maybe class background wasnt the only factor (obviously there is innate
ability and so on)can be "counteractered" or even if one is "upper" so to
speak one doesnt have to be a horrible person: these are generalities we are
talking about. We shouldnt all get into a guilt thing: I like to think about
(like everyone) where I came from etc)...but in many ways class is
irrelevant to the individual (not in the _general argument_ though) .. but I
have to live as myself: as a unique individual in the present: not to
agonise whether class has affected me - clearly it is a big factor - but
personal experiencs, my (your, our everyone's) genotype maybe just as
important: will power and positive thinking is greatly self-empowering: the
greatest being is she or he who can live in any circumstance and accept life
as a challenge and a struggle and build on their inner strengths: without
being a Buddhist (I'm not) this philosophy means that I rely on my own inner
love of myself which gives me a greater capacity to love others and to work
on (not maybe solve) life's problems. this doesnt mean that I am an Ayn Rand
for I lean left  (joke here>>).....I believe she was/is a great novelist but
is rather right wing in her individulaist philosophy: but somewhat I see
that as also important: its the paradox: we have free will but we are part
of an historical process. We pass in and thru time. We are all descended
from the Big Bang. And we are all unique: we need each other but we need to
build our selves... Thoughts of some kind of a brain, Richard.

I agree with you re Ron Silliman. He is a great poet and I have heard that
he visited prisons and his work is (or many of  its aspects) ae located in
the "real". He hasnt had the last word yet though. But some of that direct,
detailed and near-minute observation of his might be said to be "working
class" ... but members of the working class are also often intelligent
intellectuals (not cretins at all and I dont think anyone on the list thinks
that working class people are).It was good that people memorised poems: I
wish I could  remember more: some I can. But the Langpos would be critical
of the sort of pseudo-real poetry promulgated by Kipling: a  lot of working
class people in those days had simplistic and racialist views that "jelled"
with Kipling: the guy was liked by T S Eliot who was an avid racist for
god's sake!  Kipling's poetry is crap!!!  Garbage, bilge, sewerage, sputum.
Vachel Lindsay..well ok not so bad. It is a fact that many people and
especially working class people have this knowledge of poetry: trust me I
move amongst them..."But it doesnt rhyme?"  or  "It doesnt make sense."
Poetry is a high art available to the working class and everyone else on the
earth but it IS a high art. It takes learning:its often hard.  "God is
distant, difficult" (Geoffrey Hill). The other aspect of Silliman's poetry
is its "inward" and very clever intellection, its formal methodology,
"radical articfice", complex structure, and complex and interesting
theoretical basis. Because someone hides behind "working class" is no excuse
to avoid "difficulty" or intellection: poetry is  - sure, driven or based
upon deep feelings in many cases or it becomes lifeless - but it is also an
art: guided by intelligence and intense thought.  Memorising a whole lot of
bad poems IS cretinous: we who love to be surprised and challenged and
puzzled or even baffled may be nervous John Wieners or confident Ezra Pounds
or Insurance executives like Wallace Stevens (or his "counterpart" the
milionnaire Charles Ives in music) and so on.
  No, R S may have the next word: I dont now who'll have the last....Richard

Like the journalists Whitman and Sandburg and others were/are, their free
verse was sparse on connectives, subordinate clauses--relying instead on
dramatic juxtaposition of simple sentences. As they worked, they worked it
through, working it further.

And the editorials of the day ran to call their work "collocations of
words", "ragged lines", "imprudent affronts to the poetry-loving public",
and my personal favorite, "unregulated word eruptions".

Yes, the form of poetry, or seeming lack thereof, causes irritation (yes!),
but the working-class content and use of vernacular grates as well.

Maybe more of us are "more at home in the brickyard than on the slopes of
Parnassus." Most of us now seem to be placeless, translators of the
nontraditional. Rather than fixed in the order of conning Grecian urns, our
lineage is fluid, nomadic, transitional. But once, at least, we were "home",
and our translating powers rhizome from there, coming to be in large part
from necessity, and as such, some of us find our spiritual worth in the
brickyard, some in Parnassus...still more of us... as Garfield, beautiful
Garfield...in the limbo of both.

Glad to see all this discussion tho I remain wary of email! In response to
something Camille said and also what Arielle said, I just want to suggest
that maybe (or maybe I just took it personally so it seems this way) that at
some mid 90s point or sometime in the pop culture (and whackademic) the
"white trash" model/group was like the last bastion of who it was ok to make
fun of -- or analyse weirdly -- or have spreads of models dressed like as a
very downhome sort of exotica. And this makes Arielle's point about how
maybe class is the last most invisible untalked about thing. Or current, I
don't like to say last because it implies a progress that I think limits our
understanding of history. Anyway, is it ok for the editors of Vogue or some
sort of pop cultural critic to use "white trash" (cf the white trash
cookbook, etc, I can think of more if you can't already think of your own
examples)(meaning I don't want to be toooo wordy) just because said ed or
critic is themselves white? And no, I don't think so. It's an old game
that's been going on since this country began and before, divide and conquer
etc. CF Ron Takaki, _Iron Cages_.

Anyway I also wanted to add that I have NO DOUBT that some of these issues
will come up in a nonwhite vein at the Indigenous Writing Conference we are
having here at SPT the first weekend in April. For example, if you go from a
reservation to college what happens, if you are an urban raised native, etc,
etc, all these educational and social and cultural things mixed up by
movements from class to class or just plain experience, where your life
takes you.

Anyway.

from Richard (thank you by the way) "but he strict definion of working
class would actually include everyone EXCEPT people who own the meeans of
production."

from Joe (and thanks too) "clearly though, this question of "working class"
or (as in my case
too) poverty class (and working class is, or used to be, that much
*closer* to same, no?  ...   i would say said nerve is an experiential one,
having to do (for a
change, and thankfully) with poets/writers discussing their
bread-earning locations and histories"

from Arielle (muchos gracias tambien) "I find it funny/odd/problematic/cool
that there
seems to be a trend of poets listing all their
"working class" jobs in their bio notes ... the pressures of a working
class mentality on
their middle class lives"

(and thanks, gracias, domo arigato, merci beuacoup, danke, mille grazie,
tesekkurler, gratias, muito ubrigado, hvala, kiitos, mange tak, to everyone
else as well (courtesy: www.logos.it/dictionary and Mr. Roboto))


Hmm, the means of production question of course -- so a question could be
if a university produces anything?  if so what and who does the work of
production and who controls that work?  (hell if I know cuz if I did I
wouldn't be having aforementioned problem with security and what happens
hand to mouth if I've got to give somebody like a hand.)  Like poets not
talking about the benjamins (or in the case of most poets, the lincolns
(not the kind that competes with the Caddy -- you know?)) there's a fair
bit of silence about the "work" of teaching and universities and all that
(tho I know some have written about it (I've read some about it and'ld like
to read more if anyone has a suggestion or two?))  I mean it's a business
(duh, rumble) much like most.  So as per the norm -- I'm lost as a
hydrophobe in Venice.

Is the division between poverty class and working class useful these days?
One thing I thought that separated me from working class as I've been
thinking about this over the last couple days as I'm prone or vertical to
do is that I have a chance to move from the lowly position I'm in to one of
relative careeric and finacial security, but so does a factory worker --
you turn your screw (make sure the first-years know a comma splice from an
orange slice) for a few years, then you get to make sure other people turn
their screws the right way, then you get to make sure........  I mean the
fundamental problem is we've got an assload (more than a shitload (really,
do the math)) of people who can't afford to live all over the world (who
manage somehow anyway, cuz though we're dropping like flies, we're also
living like locusts.)  Poverty's the problem whether you're blue, white,
red, green, black, purple, or magenta collared.  I don't mean that to say
that I've got it as bad as somebody working in a Nike factory at all -- I'd
much rather be me (and be free to be me, but not for free -- you know?)
Now is the problem capitalism and is the solution the anti-globilzation
forces?  Fuck if I know (see above parenthetical about how'd I'd have a job
if I were smert.)  I mean some of 'em seem to have their heads on good
(with glue, staples, a little twine), but I just write poems.  But if we're
talking experiential (of which I'm a fan as Joe) how do we make enough
dough to live and keep our gingerbread house in order but also fight
against the need to make so much dough to live or make sure the dough is
getting around and we don't have those weird bubbles under one slice so the
cheese all slides off and you're just eating dough instead of the sauce and
cheese and what have you.  How have other people (I mean you people) done
it?  Is there another way to have money (not enough for goofy shirts, but
enough to take a "sheila" or (what's kiwi for guy, Richard?) out to some
fancy dinner (like with pate) and dancing (me, I like to salsa) and theater
(I've always enjoyed odd (meaning as you like it (god, that was terrible
wasn't it? (really, be honest))) productions of Shakespeare)) and time
(meaning not working 40+ (you know so we can write which is what we all
want to really do right?)) that isn't teaching?

I find the "working class" job resume kind of funny too.  It does seem a
little like a mainstream punk band talking about how they have all of Minor
Threat's stuff on vinyl (but not so much if it isn't punctuated by "and now
works at X university with Professor Xavier") not to say that they don't
and that's not a good thing, but there's an attempt to get some sort of
street cred as they say.  The bio thing I admire is when the bio includes
an entire list of the author's educational experience -- "Blah Blah Blah
started their education at St. Vinnie's daycare where s/he showed a natural
proclivity for stacking blocks and then destroying the ensuing tower.  From
there is a was a brief stint at the Spiro Agnew Kindergarten, before
launching full time into a diverse curriculum at Equator
Elementary............. and received an MFA from University X (where they
studied telepathy with professor X.)"  My mother had a serious (still does)
I'll say poverty mentality (as opposed to working class tho there's still
that question about the relations between those two) as I was coming up.
She'd never let the heat be set above 65 in the winter ("it's cold, mom"
"put on a sweater") or let us use the air conditioning at all even though
the AC was part of the appeal about the house.  We got all our clothes from
JC Penny, Goodwill, Sears (I still love tough skin jeans though though it's
hard to fit 'em anymore (three layers of fabric on each knee?  what's not
to love?)) ate generic food, I was 14 when we stayed in a hotel for the
first time (instead of camping or staying with someone we even distantly
knew) when we traveled, we did a lot of things but mostly cuz we lived in
DC and it's all free -- though we had the bucks to do more probably.  My
mom's family made it through the depression with money actually (bizarre, I
still don't know how), but lost most/all of it after (again bizarre.)  I
wonder how much of that mentality is depression era as opposed to working
class (that is assuming the two are opposed (I mean I know the working
class was probably opposed to the whole depression thing but couldn't do
much about it but starve, right?))  So I don't know.  At this point I think
my mom's penny pinching is mostly an odd and endearing quirk, but that's
had the upside of prepping me for a life without dough and to live in a
house where I don't set the heat above 60 and get lots of sweaters with
strange quotations from the Goodwill.

Aye caramba -- there I go babbling again.........

Here is a comment on the Bill's post made by Caribbean-American poet James J=

  Bill (I think?) makes an important point about the working class (or=20
any other subaltern group) being at the mercy of the ideologues.  But,=20
obviously the working class are not preoccupied with notions of the=20
avant garde, because that sort of navel-gazing with which the=20
intellectuals seem obsessed, would ring absurdly to someone whose=20
occupation can barely put food on the table.  One needs to look no=20
further for an illustration than in American pop-culture where=20
black-urban underclass and the white-rural underclass generate the most=20
slick "tied to profit"  musical "product", R&B/Hip-Hop and Country.
I am reminded of the mid  1970's feud between the 2 towering caribbean=20
intellectuals, Derek Walcott and E.K. Braithwaite.  Braithwaite, a poet=20
prone to using the vernacular voice, impugned Walcott for his=20
"Anglican-verse"far removed from the realities of the West-Indian poor =20
 Walcott reasoned in turn that the poor would quicker relate to his=20
verse and it's Biblical rhythmns that to Braithwaite's impenetrable=20
collages, made vernacular only by the use of strategically placed=20
"aints" and "gonnas".  Meanwhile, as these hyper-educated men feuded,=20
the Caribbean people went on celebrating their calypso singers as the=20
true poet laureates, blissfully unaware that these academics (Walcott by=20
then at Boston and Braithwaite back at Oxford) were racking up the=20
praise around wealthy dinner tables.
All this is to say, so what.  We can speak of mimesis et all forever,=20
but the bottom line is, these language games are just that, games.  You=20
can speak for, about or around the guy who cuts sugarcane or drives a=20
bus all you want and then obsess over whether you have a right to do=20
that.  The canecutter, the busdriver, never heard your first statement=20

I'm barely a poet but I do try to write poetry, but working class is
sometimes a strange notion compared to poverty...  I mean I am nowhere near
working class but I am poor...

I live on $366/month + I get free housing at my father's house
I have to go to medicaid clinics to get health problmes dealt with
but I am in no way working class-- both parents are professionals (though
neither is working and both are in precarious financial situations) & I
graduated from Columbia

It is a stereotype, but I really did wait in the GYN clinic with a pregnant
homeless woman who was having her eighth child and was trying to get
housing.  I too wouldn't mind housing in the projects, so we had something
in common...

The problems of the genuinely poor are nothing like the problems of the
working class, who are, after all, WORKING, often at decent union rates.
Whne I was working a year and a half ago, I was a low wage earner (mostly
because Social Security was taking back half my earnings), but I wasn't in
poverty as far as I was concerned-- although I was still below the poverty
line then.  But now I am really poor.  Peple who are Working, paradoxically,
have more time than those who are impoverished. When you are working, you
can come home after work to your own (rented) apartment for a spot of poetry
or even to write poetry.

I have written a lot of poetry since my income went away, but that's because
I am lucky in that moving back to my father's did not mean moving back into
a home with many children & grandchildren milling around and no bedroom of
mf my own and only the kitchen heated, etc. etc.  That is due to not being
working class, I guess-- my father may have little income now, but like many
prfessionals, he had only one child and has a nice, spacious apartment...

So I suppose the people I meet in waiting rooms and am talking about are
people who fall from the ranks of the working class down into total poverty.

When you are impoverished, you might have to walk around all day maybe.
because your shelter kicks you out during the day, but you have to carry
around all your stuff.  If it's not too obvious and you don't smell bad, you
can go in a library, and then you might be able to read poetry, but you
probably don't because you are so tired from no sleep because the room held
seventy women and two of them snored, 5 coughed. 2 talked all night to
voices, two had sex with each other, and one had managed to sneak in a man
to have sex with...  So you fall asleep in the library but you have taught
yourself not to slump over and to sleep with the book at the right distance
from your face because you get kicked out of libraries if you sleep...  And
then it's time for the big line to get back into the shelter and eat a
greasy unhealthy dinner and a group shower and lights off at some absurdly
early hour which no one complains about...

People who live in poverty and depend on a patchwork of programs in order to
eat and sleep other than on the street have to spend inordinate amounts of
time waiting in offices for those programs.  They spend their lives sitting
in waiting rooms.  If they had a job, they'd have to quit the job or get
fired aso they could go to waiting rooms.  Just to get antibiotics for a
sore throat at the clinic I go to, you could easily spend all day there, and
then half the time, no matter how minor your complaint, instead of treating
it they send you for more tests and to specialists, so that each visit to
primary care balloons into three tests and visits to two specialists and you
still haven't gotten any treatment, just more appointments.

Then they also wait at welfare or at Social Security or at the Food Stamp
office, or at HUD or at a mental health agency...

I am not sure these poor people have time for poetry, the way working class
people do, but when they do, I would hope they'd want something ANGRY, like
some of the slam poets or Baraka in some phases or what not, but I bet the
poetry they really like is in the Readers' Digest (they read the Readers'
Digest in the numerous waiting rooms, but maybe only because that's what's
there to read).  I suspect some of them tried to write poetry as teenagers,
at least the women, and might become interested again if they didn't have to
fight for a place to stay or a way to get medical care or enough money for
food every single day.  I don't know that these experiences make good poetry
in the sense that "we" might judge it -- I am not myself usually that taken
with "sincere" work by people who have really suffered, although someotimes
one has to be extremely respectful of it, even impressed, as with early AIDS
poems or poetry by people under siege in Sarajevo or something.  But one is
impressed on a scale other than the usual poetic scale-- it's more  being
impressed by the bravery of a person in that situation who would stop and
write a poem, even afterwards, that resembles a poem. (If it is really bad,
I am not impressed, but I'm talking about the kind of testimonial poems that
are perfectly good, just predictable and ordinary in their use of language.)

Hey this is true enough as a statement about white american poets but
breaks down internationally and racially.

E.g. here in san francisco there has been a very queer spoken word
scene that is working class and white. Not much interest in theory.
the (white) working class dyke scene in my experience is suspicious
of theory, it can arouse real anger. After one itty-bitty presentation
with a knotted up chunk of theory in the middle a woman I actually
know came up and blasted me, what the F**K were you talking about!!?!

Lately Tisa Bryant and I at New Langton Arts have been putting together
a series Diaspora Poetics locating radical experimentation ELSEWHERE.
Communities of exile, immigration, diaspora. This is one hell of rich
vein of experimental work!! It just does not follow the paradigm of
white trust fund babies toying with abstraction. WHY.

Perhaps it's a political problem, not a literary one. There's been a lot of
anti-colonial anti-imperialist theoretical work (e.g. Said) which
has been hella useful to people coming to consciousness about the
political forces that locate them in their lives. The white (american)
working class has not been gotten such persuasive and transformative
analyses. WHY NOT.

Matvei thanks for putting on the show last nite.
and Charles thanks for the question last nite.
ANd thanks to soy bomb and the strange tension
surrounding the union steward,
I didn't get a chance to answer.
I would like to go on record as saying that:

Why I am Not a Performance Poet
1) Too lazy.
2a) I.E. One dimension can be "enough" for me during speech acts:
      linear time reading while holding sort of still.
2b) Other dimensions of motion-space and light-space
2c) Other bodies participating in 2a and 2b
3) Require hard work and practice and often a director
4) Even if you are an exceptional improvisor
      (e.g. members of the Yogurt Boys)
5) "you LIKE to say within the lines"--Todd Colby

best,
Bill Luoma

Subject:      Note on Dissenting Agency & the Concept Anti-Globalism or
              Anti-Globalization
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ron Silliman writes: "The anti-globalism movement, taken as a whole, is
frankly not promising, though it is within that coalition that answers will
have to be found."

This sentence disturbs. "Anti-globalism movement" or "anti-globalization
movement" doesn't specify an existing entity, does it? The phrase is often
used by commercial media to point to a cluster of contemporary political
dissent but it does not get the specifically anti-capitalist character of
the current oppositionality. It's a phrase that misses the severity of the
criticism by making dissent appear as a mere variety of nationalism that
advocates governmental policies to protect domestic trade. Yuck! Ick! Gack!
Shouldn't the movements be re-described in post-nationalist terms? And are
these movements, not taken as a whole, more promising? Who are the members
of this coalition such that they may be promising or not? Who, I wonder, are
the least promising agents in a transition to a post-capitalist economy today?

Well, thanks for the sentence, Ron. Prompts a number of questions. I'd like
to hear what other members of this poetics list think about these problems.
My apologies if they've already been addressed--I can only follow the
messages here sporadically.

Subject:      ...the end of human life
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

to Alan Sondheim and everyone:

re his Posting number 50924, Of Coin:
'We live within the horizon of universal apocalypse'

which reminds me of somethings I underlined recently:

(in 'Leo Strauss and Nietzsche' by Laurence Lampert, University of
Chicago Press, Chicago and London 1996, page 182):


Nietzsche speaks: '...And if the whole of humanity is destined to die
out - and who dares doubt that? - so the goal is set ... to grow
together in one and in common that it sets out as a whole to meet its
coming demise... '

(originally from 'Richard Wagner in Bayreuth' 4 end)


...which puts everything into a different perspective, does it not? -
affects each of us, profoundly, and affects all ideas...


and then from page 183 of Lampert's book, Nietzsche sings:

'...love for life as it is becomes the desire that life be eternally
what it is, that our paradise of the imperfect eternally return just
as it is.'

(from the songs that close part 3 of 'Thus Spoke Zarathrustra')


and on page 181 of his book Laurence Lampert speaks lines from
Wallace Stevens' poem 'The poems of our climate'... from which I
select:

Clear water in a brilliant bowl,
Pink and white carnations. The light
In the room like a snowy air,
Reflecting snow...

while Laurence emphasises this line:

'The imperfect is our paradise.' (but he speaks it very quietly)


...and then I underlined Lampert's astonishing statement,, on page 181:

'"what religions are good for" ...
What they are simply indispensable for, is the structuring poetry of
everyday life, that web of beliefs and values lived spontaneously by
any and every human community as its testament of the useful, the
good, and the holy.'

...which he seems to ascribe to Nietszche! (though not those words)


...and now, in the presence and hearing of these quotations, from
Sondheim to Nietzsche, I sense that a belief in progress is indeed no
longer timely, that a belief in religion is no longer irrelevant, nor
is religion 'Man's worst invention' (Marcel Duchamp), (if it is a
post-religion - not one of the failed ones) and that 'the poetry of
everything' is perhaps more relevant than is any of this? ...

...at which I imagine Percy Bysshe Shelly applauding - and restating
his Defence of Poetry. in the distance ...

...as I fall into the deepest water, beneath politics, but breathing,
and writing these words I hope without fanaticism...


But Alan, and Laurence, and Friedrich, and everyone, I cannot quite
believe in any apocalypse, or creation myth, or any other such words
or categories, because, as many people have pointed out, and as even
J R R Tolkien has:

'By ... naming things and describing them, you are only inventing
your own terms
about them. And just as speech is an invention about objects and
ideas so myth is an invention about truth'

(ascribed to Tolkien by Humphrey Carpenter in 'J R R Tolkien, a
biography', George Allen and Unwin, London 1989, page 151).


And lastly (in this disease of quotations that you have provoked,
Alan) there is a remark of the painter Francis Bacon that I remember
(perhaps imperfectly) from a radio interview:

'I am an optimist, but so far I've not found anything to be optimistic about!



with good wishes despite everything from all of us to all of us in
this less than eternity beyond theory beyond carnations or not not!


john chris

Laurie, yes, I was at that reading and vulnerable snd focussed (two words
that seldom keep company in the USA) sre aptly joined toevoke John's
presence, and not only on that occasion.
    I find your notes re working class intellectuals germane. A special case
is Lawrence, whose schoolmarm Mum might have intro'd middleclass gentilities
into the home, and given the boy permission, as it were, to love books.  His
genius by-and-by made him classless (or of all classes) and of several
nations to boot--america, mexico, and italy, notably.
  He enjoyed a sort of outsider status--though he was made to suffer for it.
I like to think he met with such snobs far less in New Mexico than in
England, where the natives are so good at it. (On a trip there in '92, by
when 40 years if trying to be understood by transatlantic students had so
taken the edge off my accent, that in europe I passed as american,I was
enjoying a conversation with an upperclass englishman when our host broke in
to tell him "you know, David was one of us"....I could scarcely get another
word out of the chap.  Who knew that I'd not have lost my accent had it been
U.  But as long as I was a Yank, he could speak freely; I didnt really
matter.  )
   John's outrageousness--the female film stars  he impersonated--satisfied
several traits of his, but one function was surely to distract one from his
sin of being 'workingclass intellectual'--john as 'gloria grahame

' (I may be projecting a wish of my own here; I'm actually not able, today,
to recall whom he did so identify with) was more outrageous than the truth.
     David.

If Israel were milk, and Palestine of honey, and China were so sweet,
We'd lie together there, I'd say you were the rose,
All among the fairest; if one voice hadn't happened,
Another took its place, I'd say your name forever,
And we would live forever; if September were another,
A day of bright fall weather, if Auschwitz hadn't happened,

More evidence, were any required, that irony vanishes in email transmission --
But this sentence has me scratching my head anyway -- what exactly would an
"anti-slushpile joke" be? and why would anybody publish an entire book (at some
expense) to make such a jest -- To discourage people from contributing for fear
that they might get a poem published in an anti slush-pile joke? Who was the
joke to be on? the contributors or the hapless readers of the volume?
Intentionality, where is thy sting?

Murat.  True up to a point.  What I meant  by "means of production" and the

in the West....I'm not a Marxist per se altho I have some left leanings
(silly term I know: sounds asa if I'm a crooked pole:oops! no sorry, crooked
tree...)...but as I understand (I was really taking fom Marx etc) he puts eg
certain unemployed etc as lumpen-proletariat and so on...the terms
themselves arent much help: what is needed is a clear definition...poets and
artists DONT own THE means of production...in any type of society there are
people with private property (property is theft should be enormous ownership
of private means etc is theft - the phrase is a bit meaningless however) and
that includes artists who, like artisans, are workers: they are in a
sub-class of the larger class working class: these divisions are only to
simplify things for  he sake of argument: poets and other creative people
are almost in a category alone: but poets can come from any class
background...that doesnt make them "better" or :"more insightful"..here  in
NZ Katherine Mansfield is sometimes attacked for being of the "upper" types
and Ken Sargeson is pitted against her...but to me their class and other
backgrounds are _less_ important than their work: i personally think both
are great writers...Sargeson wrote for Communist papers in the early days:
but I dontthink he was a communist - he may have been - and he was gay:
Mansfield had TB and was from a fairly well-to-do family: Lawrence was
jealous of her  (ability) and so I think was Eliot somewhat, but while class
is significant it isnt the major factor: the individual is always capable of
free choice regardless. Richard.

But in a subtle sense they ARE leftists: sometimes only Muslims are actively
fighting capitalism: or people from those countries (of course there is also
the anti-globalisation struggles...in the long run that they were once
Muslims or Jews or Christians would be irrelevant if the US pulled out as it
should: the US Military-Industrial comlex) is the cause of much conflict.
For "theocratic fascism" read: "countries who organise their own countries

where will your review of loss's book be available?
and what do you think of jay bolter's 'writing space', the latest version?

people get very defensive when you say the book did this or the book
did that. i find myself reacting to what bolter says about the book
and the computer as if they were adversaries, and as if they had
human characteristics, malice, ambition, etc.

undoubtably, indubiously, whatever, people have shared books for a
long time, but i meant the shared experience of and not material
possession of books.

the web is not one big room, its one big moment and we come together
at that moment in time, not place, or space.

space?, now there is an interesting word/concept in itself.
the space between words on a page, the space between reader and text,
the space between computer and end-user, the space the end-user is in
when reading or surfing the web, the cyberspace that people talk of
that we are supposed to meet in when on the web, the metaphorical
spaces of reason, recall and imagination, the space of nasa, personal
lifestyle space, are all these spaces the same?

i remember when i didn't have a computer and internet connection,
writing and reading were solitary endeavours. that is why i became a
performance poet because the poetry sounding was a community event, a
sharing of a writing/reading experience.

with the internet connection, i can read a post on webartery, can
sleep, can wake still thinking of that post and send off my response.
that discussion creates a timeline of its own within the timeline of
duration, ie clocktime.
the webartery timeline works from post to post, sometimes it is
running parallel with clocktime, when the posts are fast and furious,
at other times it is suspended eg. when servers play up, sleep, going
to work, cooking dinner, etc..

what i do know is that thinking and writing are at the basis of all
of it, all communication between human beings, and i find it
difficult to agree with those like bolter who say we have switched
from a verbal to a visual culture. the examples given of things we
now read visually instead of verbally still have writing at their
source, the tv news-report, the movie, television soapies,
supermario, the graphical web. and the readers of such visual texts
still have to have a knowledge built on the written stuff to
interpret the images, the non-verbal signs.

have to break out of webartery timeline now to get my son to school,
can't wait to return for the responses of my community when i am once
again immersed in webartery/e-Poetry/ubpoetics time.

I understand what you're saying. My father was an architect in a working
class area (but in a sense he was still "working class" but now he had moved
up the ladder a bit and there were people we knew in "Remmers" (posh  part
of Auckland) etc who were very nice but they were also rich and talked like
kind people and so on  and often they were genuinely very good people just
well off
and I was a bit of the "meat in the sandwich" (embarrassed because my mother
insisted I wear shoes (all the other boys were tough little buggers) and
even embarrassed that we were a bit 'better off" and because they were
English I was once accused of being a "pom"  (which in those days was a
crime - little joke ) .... there was not anti-semitism that I was aware of
(altho I know it exists here) so your situation wouldnt be common here as
such in terms of being Jewish but it would in terms of your "class
orientation" so to speak: but what we are talking about is an attitude of
mind, habits, culture, individual genotype, experience etc interacting with
one's actual economic state or status: being working class etc isnt "good"
or "bad": there are good people of any class but class as a general concept
is useful to be aware of: I listed my occupations because ..dont know
why..not to impress by reverse snobbery: actually in some respects I also
(another side of me) hated the working class and I had a kind of
division -still do somewhat -  sometimes I dream of becoming a "big shot"
with tons of cash....but (anycase) when I talk to people I treat each person
the same even Bush  or the Queen I'd talk the same to to their faces: you
wont see me grovel to anyone unles they're threatenning to punch my lights
out or they've got a gun pointing at me...sorry, silly joke... but a poetry
chap book I did had on the back: "Richard is descended from the Big Bang"...
and that's true: we all bleed and so forth. Regards, Richard.  PS The point
is most of us - regardless of our occupations, unless we actually own eg a
big company (like Bill Gates etal) are working class regardless of what we
do or even if we dont even work and regardless of how poor or not we
are:people in poverty are on the lower strata of the broad class which is
strictly speaking Working Class (although we think of street cleaners etc:
an accountant (say) on $100,000 is still Working Class, but his/her outlook
or philosophy  etc may not be: although one might expect such a person to be
more likely to be "right" or orientated to supporting the Ruling Class
(bourgesoisie as Marx defined it they were the Middle Class 300 years ago
and are now the Ruling Class -  or the owners of the means of production)
they could even be Marxists or whateverists....and religion causes (or can
be used by the unscrupulous to cause) divisions amongst the Working Class as
"divide et imperum" is stet.

Apologies for inserting myself here.  Seems to me that poetry is economically
viable, in the academy.  Anthologies, some of them, sell quite well.  And
many poets make a living traveling from reading to reading.  It's true that
most poets don't achieve this status, but publishers can and do sell enough
anthologies and books by single authors (if s/he's the right author) to
justify publication.  Publishers also use low sales of poetry as a tax write
off, and that increases their profit.  So long as poetry is bound and
delivered between two covers with price tag, it's a product, right?  The
situation is not all that dissimilar to that of serious (classical?) music
and jazz.  Best, Bill

so much good stuff here on this issue of economic class that i find
the prospect of addressing same with any measure of insight kinda
daunting, i must admit... but since i pride mself in my
self-absorption (;->) i will lay it on some...

first, richard:  i'm a pro-collective bargaining guy... unions have
their problems, is all's i'm trying to say (my father used to bitch
about seniority constantly, yet he was, as i say, a union steward)...
to me, the only alternative to unions is corporate management
structure---e.g., many aspects of the u.s. govt. since wwii
anyway---and i can't see having one w/o the other... so yeah, i'm
pro-union, period...

i mean, it seems to me that we bitch way more about unions than we do
about the *real* culprits---i.e., the *corporations*...

secondly, murat:  good question, and thank you for it!... but i don't
think you can isolate poetic production from the larger capitalist
system within which it operates, and which simultaneously supports
and thwarts such production... as an academic, the symbolic/cultural
captial i accrue from book production is hardly incidental to my
wage----strictly publish-or-perish in this household... and this
household drops about 15% of its net income on professional expenses
related to publication (i publish scholarship too, which generates
zero royalties... if i sell a script though, i'm in the money---but
since i don't find it possible to write scripts w/o writing poetry, i
would say that these practices are related even at the language
level)... clearly, those of you who are not academics don't enjoy
quite the publish-or-perish stricture---but you too accrue some
amount of symbolic/cultural capital, and likely pay (out of pocket)
to publish your works (ultimately)... which money comes from some
part of the (broadly) capitalist system, even if you work for a
nonprofit...

in any case, the economic analysis here has to do, at the very least,
with understanding (at least) two competing or contrary economic
modalities, and with the knowledge that gdp in this country (at
present) is supported by a federal operating budget that is currently
in the red... consumers are going into debt to support this output
(let's set enron aside for a moment)... i have a habit of saying,
e.g., that education loses money--- as something of a public work,
which presumes to work for the public good (the mission of many
colleges and universities still tied to educating a labor
workforce)---which is to say, that the govt pays (and should pay) for
certain things... which is to say, that taxpayers pay (as should
corporations)... which is to say, that you can't generalize negative
profits into the absence of productivity... which *isn't* to say
that, b/c a capitalist system supports education (well, our "state u"
is currently receiving 11.9% of its operating budget from the state
of colorado), education ought therefore to be run like a capitalist
system...

ditto for poetry... in fact i would ask for more taxpayer dollars...
and i would ask that folks come to understand the consumption of
resources and wages to produce or ensure an active gift or barter
economy as intrinsically related to the capitalist enterprise (as
things stand)...

am i making sense?...

----

i want to mention here in passing two artifacts, one a poem, and one
a nonfiction memoir, that have profoundly influenced my understanding
of how class might be handled in more literary terms:  first, ben
hamper's ~rivethead~, which appeals to me, despite several working
assumptions that strike me as problematic (chiefly, hamper's
unbridled representational approach), perhaps in part b/c hamper
attends to the hourly side of factory life during the same seven
years or so i was experiencing the white-collar side of same
(77-84)... hamper ends up with a nervous breakdown, i end up in grad
school (and this gives some idea, i think, of why i feel kinda
privileged and surely lucky to have been holding that sheepskin)...

and secondly, sharon doubiago's ~hard country~, one of the great long
u.s. poems of the past 25 years, as i see it, and one that hardly
gets mentioned in these parts... b/c of its more stridently feminist,
class-based appeal?---i certainly didn't and don't find that book an
"easy" read... so it's not that doubiago isn't doing interesting
things formally (if you will)... and i would rank it right up there
with ~my life~ and ~midwinter day~, published around the same time...

----

this brings me digressively to something that, i must admit, really
torques me:  that post by caribbean poet james janus henderson... and
i.s., please feel free to forward my response to mr. henderson (i
must admit though---i'm generally loathe to respond to a forwarded
post, b/c it feels like i'm playing with someone who doesn't really
want to play with me):

sure, one can always pooh-pooh the sound and fury of
intellectual-artistic work, esp. work that works at some intellectual
remove from popular forms (i.e., as i read that post, brathwaite's
presumably "impenetrable collages," and less so, walcott's presumably
"biblical rhythms") by observing that the lay public doesn't
participate directly in same,  aren't paying attention, and have
opted instead to listen to their radios... part of me wants to say,
SO WHAT?... so popular culture is, uhm, popular (yeah, a tautology),
but that means that it's more vital than cultural forms that are
*not* popular?... i'm sure the former will come as a Major Insight to
those of us who struggle for that baker's dozen readership (as
above)... as to the latter---

the real question to be asked is this:  would it behoove said popular
cultural audience to have been able to read and comment on both
walcott and brathwaite? (assuming that putting things this way isn't
already a condescension)... do walcott and brathwaite's contributions
to the public sphere bleed off (sorry) in ways that benefit said
culture-at-large?... perhaps this is something of a literacy
question, at its root... but having made this speculative leap, the
next question that emerges (pour moi) is whether, given such a
literacy reality, walcott or brathwaite might turn out to be the more
challenging... or to put it another way, whether one writer speaks to
context in more bracing terms, with more positive net effect...

and again, i'm pretty sure that this rather functional way of putting
things is bound to irk some of you on this list, for whom the
artistic process is not to be questioned in terms of said net effect
(am i wrong?)... seen in this light, one can perhaps make certain
claims for brathwaite's work over and against walcott's (i would
mself, though it's walcott who holds that nobel)... but whatever the
case, to claim that both writers are overshadowed by calypso music,
or disregarded by the workaday "masses," strikes me as something of a
specious nod toward something like orality, at worst, and (as i say)
a tautology, at best... and i'm the last guy in the world to think
that writing something a certain way automatically alters social
reality for the better, or for the worse...

best,

Hmmm, I agree, but disagree -- we (poets of which I've been accused of
being) have the means of production meaning we put our asses in a chair and
write, but there are a whole assload (sorry, I'm a fan of the expression
for reasons which are probably only too clear) of things (boy, that's
specific) that contribute to and contextualize that production.  Most
obviously, the traditional means of distribution (print publication) over
which most poets don't have control.  Electronic distribution (email,
web-sites, etc. (self-pub too though it doesn't have to be e-pubbin') seems
to provide more control, but still costs dinero.  As does the act of
producing poetry costs bucks even if publication or distribution aren't
goals.  Since there is little money that directly comes from publishing
poems (most advances/awards are well below 5 grand (well, well, well even)?
(though there is the indirect money (i.e. teaching jobs, readings, etc.)))
there has to be some money coming from somewhere to keep said poet alive
and physically and mentally fit enough to write and let alone have the time
to do the act.  So while we may own our brains, butts, and hands (hopefully
some paper and a few pens too) in some senses we're also owned and at the
mercy of many others at the same time also as well tambien.  In terms of
"want" well there's the idea of poetry (general art (seargent maybe too))
as a part of a culture's cultural capital (look, look -- we're so
civilized.  Phooey on you, Gandhi..........

In fact, Ron, what *is* theocratic fascism?  I don't see either theocracy
(direct rule by a divine power) or fascism in the U.S.

Seems to kind of -- surely you don't intend this, but -- soften the
historical reality of fascism.

********************************************
Some Notes Towards Last Night’s Conversation

Text as text is uninterruptible tyranny. Poetry
is failure. Tyranny as text is poetry. Poetry is
uninterruptible. Poetry is terrible. Interrupting
terror, words in postmodernity are injected with
meaning the way "foodness" is injected into a Big
Mac (tm). Meaning, with injected postmodernity,
is part of the blue print (sic) of poetry. Its
architecture is inherently unstable.

"The rise of capitalism parallels the advance of
romanticism..."
- John Ashbery.

Poetry is the refutation of purity, so don't
shoot until you see the whites of their lives.
Reader = Text. All the right space at the white
margins. In the margins of the book I purchased
there are notes written in black pen for the
first thirty pages. I guess they ran outta steam,
or maybe were so taken by the spell of the text,
they were overcome and could write no more. Maybe
they were interrupted with a very important phone
call.

"Too many poets are like middle aged mothers
trying to get their kids to eat too much cooked
meat..."
- Frank O'Hara

The better you get, the more some uppity youngin'
wants to see if you are as fast on the draw as
everyone says. So you might as well lay low, wait
for all your enemies to ping each other off in
the crossfire, so you can escape town with the
gold, the horses, and if you are lucky, the
school-marm.

"At a Dada exhibition in Dusseldorf, I was
impressed that though Schwitters and Picabia and
the others had all become artists with the
passing of time, Duchamp's work remained
unacceptable as art."
- John Cage

The parallel of romanticism is asylum.
Neo-Formalism is stage hypnosis attempting to
convince you that the last one-hundred and fifty
years of poetry, the best parts of it anyways,
did not occur. "When you wake up, you will giggle
with rapturous glee at a well transposed trochee
and iambic foot." If I shoot myself in the iambic
foot, maybe I can avoid the draft. I cannot read
a sonnet for the same reason I cannot enter the
abode of someone over the age of seventy-five
without familial duties being involved in some
way. I am certain I am losing much wisdom in
this, but the smell!

"We didn't teach verse writing skills. We were
all emotionally bankrupt and went around asking
the students for love.
- Allen Ginsberg

There are only so many open spaces available in
this racket. If one in ten million people were
poets, and each poet wrote a volume of poems
every ten years, you would have to read a
thousand books of poetry a year just to keep up.
A book of poems for breakfast. A book of poems
for lunch. A book of poems for dinner. C'est
impossible! My math could be wrong on that. Yeats
was bad at math, too, and Einstein was, according
to the legend, a poor speller. Physics knows
nothing of language.

The fall of John Ashbery parallels with the
advance of Neo-Formalism.

"You wouldn't believe how much television is
purely Satanic."
- Overheard at a local soup kitchen

John Cage's mesostics are the most pure poems of
this century. They are total gestures that
re-align all previous understandings of text.
There has to be a way to make things better for
everybody. Rhyme = Regression. Slant Rhyme =
Joyful Detour. Poetry is not an experience. It is
the clear solution into which language is
dissolved (de-solved). Calm and cool panoptics
intensity. Poetry as compared to music is sadly
lacking. It fails on the level of pure
abstraction. The only upside about this is that
poetry can be utterly indigestible. Pound's
"Cantos" are a precursor to digitalized, sampled
electronica compositions. The essence of
capitalism is the presence of places wherein you
are not permitted to wear jeans after a certain
hour.

The rise of workshop verse parallels the advance
of the automobile.

“The kind of poetry I want is not a happy art
with uplifting messages and easy to understand
emotions. I want a poetry that's bad for you.”
-Charles Bernstein

A poet may wish to write utterly personal poems
anyone might have written. Anthologies are filled
with such poems. Anthologies are the cryogenic
stasis of poetry, hurtling through the universe
(universities) in a well-built rocket ship.
Plain text is the best font of all. Enjoy poetry,
you will never get to read enough of it, after
all. Poetry is a joy. Sometimes it manages to be
nearly as good as television. Know that you
exist, and enjoy the contours of your mind. Don’t
strain too hard. Read “The Art of Poetry” by
Kenneth Koch. That should take you as much time
as watching a sitcom, though you can do both,
reading the poem during the commercials. Don’t
parody yourself. Text = Interlocutory Cremation
(sometimes). Don’t call yourself an angel for not
“selling out” when no-one is buying. Capitalism
will catch up with you soon enough. Meaning is a
plastic baggie used to carry home a fish. Clear,
malleable, plastic, imprisoning, revealing, and
provisional.

I’ll shut up now.


=====
...I am a real poet. My poem
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.
 [from "Why I Am Not A Painter" by Frank O'Hara]

I can empathise with yr situation in a true
Oprah-fied fashion. I live on about $520 a month
- of which over two thirds is spent on rent.

What you said about working people often having
more time is very much true. Much of my time and
schedule is eat up walking, I cannot afford
transportation, and so much of your life is
dependant on the schedules and time frames of
others.

You could say I have paid my dues for poetry. In
high school I had what would probably now be
called ADD, though in truth it was simply
boredom.
I would spend days cutting classes and head to
the university library, perusing the stacks,
reading whatever came to me.

No High School means no University means No job
tho lots of the people I know with those things
are in little better financial shape than I am
in.

There is a definite class/culture dividing line.
This is a University town. People who go to
University, or teach there, do *not* tend to
reach out to the literary community as a whole.

I have lived in various missions, so I know how
hard it is to sleep. A good pair of earplugs -
sometimes with a pair of headphones on over them
-
would get you through the night.

I've run into people who write "poems" at the
lower end of the sphere. Oddly enough, they tend
to rarely be angry or "revolutionary".

One time when I was bone broke, and living in the
mission in another city, so I didn't even have
friends to rely on, I found that the experience,
the utter downward pull of the earth, was an
opening for me to write a new kind of poetry, one
more gentle and more serious.

I am not sure how poetry can "make things
better." If poetry had the power to do that, I
would be suspicious of it.

I am reminded that before the industrial
revolution, manual labours sometimes hired people
to read to them while they worked. Who could even
imagine such a thing today?

Now I find myself in a strange place.
On one hand, I am opposed to education as a kind
of "social climbing". Education, in the classical
sense, ought to be about the building of
character and the soul. Of course it is so far
from that ideal so as to be laughable.

On the other hand, the intellectual stimulation I
crave simply *cannot* be met at the level I am
living at right now. Most of the people I meet
who are poor, but are seeking "answers", looking
for a wider frame, one that art and poetry and
philosophy may offer, instead get sold a kind of
Fundamentalist Christianity.  Thus I am
considering enrolling in University and getting a
degree. Which, if it helps me get a job I don't
feel makes me want to kill myself, great. If it
doesn't, then I am stuck right back where I am -
only in $30 000 of debt.

Most of the poor people I know are utterly
uninterested in poetry, or much of anything else.
Getting high maybe. It's an easier escape - and
good weed beats a bad poem any day.

I'm skeptical about the use of poetry as a
rhetorical force. I myself have learned a great
deal from the language, beat and avant garde
poetics, from several angles. But I do know that
if a revolution occurs - and hey, it could happen
tommorrow, I want there to be poets around,
speaking their piece and holding out for truth.

SFJAZZ SPRING SEASON 2002 SALUTES "JAZZ WOMEN"

SFJAZZ celebrates Women's History Month by kicking off its third annual
Spring Season of concerts, films, family matinees and more with a week-long
tribute to great "Jazz Women" of yesterday and today.

The Season opens on MARCH 19 with a special panel discussion on "Women in
Jazz" - the legacy of their contributions, the obstacles they've faced, and
where they're headed in the future. The panel will be led by
scholar/poet/activist Dr. Angela Davis, author of "Blues Legacies and Black
Feminism: Gertrude 'Ma' Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday," and will
also include Professor Sherrie Tucker, author of "Swing Shift: 'All-Girl'
Bands of the 1940s"; pianist/composer Mary Watkins; bandleader and acclaimed
composer/arranger Maria Schneider; and drummer Susie Ibarra. Tickets are
$10.  Please contact Christina Coughlin directly about group discounts.

For tickets & more information, visit
http://www.sfjazz.org/html/events/ss2002/shows/0319panel.htm
or call 415-776-1999

"Jazz Women" continues on MARCH 20 with a one-time-only film program of rare
archival footage showcasing some of the "founding mothers" of jazz, such as
Mary Lou Williams, Melba Liston and Hazel Scott.

Then on MARCH 21, the acclaimed Marilyn Crispell Trio featuring Gary Peacock
and Paul Motian shares a bill with New York-based percussionist Susie
Ibarra's Quartet. Crispell's trio "has made two of the finest piano trio
albums in recent memory," according to The New York Times.

On MARCH 22, the Maria Schneider Orchestra will perform a mixed program of
Scheider's own highly praised compositions (she's been named Down Beat
"Arranger of the Year" for two consecutive years), along with the beloved
"Porgy and Bess" charts prepared by her late mentor, Gil Evans, for the
great Miles Davis.

And on Saturday, MARCH 23, Cassandra Wilson -- "America's best singer"
(Time) -- comes to San Francisco to launch the national tour for her brand
new CD, Belly of the Sun, a collection of originals and utterly distinctive
revisitations of classic tunes by Bob Dylan, the Band, Antonio Carlos Jobim,
and Caetano Veloso.

On MARCH 24, in the afternoon, Jane Bunnett & Spirits of Havana will perform
a Family Matinee blending their Cuban-flavored Latin Jazz with commentary
and questions from the audience. Kids are welcome and discounted rates are
available for those under 18.

Finally, on MARCH 24 in the evening, soprano saxophonist Jane Bunnett & her
Spirits of Havana again take the stage with their infectious Cuban rhythms
-- this time sharing a bill with another heralded soprano saxophonist, Jane
Ira Bloom, "a formidable improviser with a full-blooded tone that sets her
apart" (The New Yorker).

Here's how the IWW decides how to figure out your social situation. It's
their first question on eligibility for membership: "You must be a worker
(not an employer), and you cannot have the power to hire and/or fire."
Simple. Nothing about how much you earn, etc., though dues are keyed to
that. Sylvester

A MEETING FOR DOUGLAS OLIVER


You may already know that we decided to put together a collection to
document and commemorate the meeting which took place in London on 22nd
October 2000 in memory of Douglas Oliver.  All the texts which were
specially written for that event have been collected, and those who on the
night read only from the works of Douglas Oliver have provided new or
reprinted texts.  The editing is now completed, and the book, titled as
above, contains poems by John James, David Chaloner, Wendy Mulford, Peter
Riley, Allen Fisher, Tony Lopez, Ken Edwards, Kelvin Corcoran, Pete Smith,
and Nicholas Johnson, as well as prose about or concerning Doug by John
Hall, Kevin Nolan and Denise Riley, and a new Dante translation by Andrew
Brewerton.  The cover is designed by Julia Ball. It will be published by
infernal methods in collaboration with Street Editions and Poetical
Histories.

The next stage has presented some problems, because we would prefer this
book to be produced to a standard of quality and elegance befitting its
occasion.  For this we need to raise more money than we can as individuals
contribute.

We are therefore seeking subscribers to this edition, and we suggest a
suitable contribution might be in the region of £20 to £50, though amounts
above and below these will not of course be refused. If you feel able to
contribute,  please send your payment to Peter Riley at 27, Sturton Street,
Cambridge CB1 2QG, UK, cheques made out to "Peter Riley (Books)".  All
subscriptions will be acknowledged in print, unless requested otherwise. The
provisional closing date for subscriptions is Easter 2002.


THE PUBLISHERS
infernal methods (Nigel Wheale)
Poetical Histories  (Peter Riley)
Street Editions (Wendy Mulford)

(Equivalent U.S. dollar cheques are acceptable. If sending a cheque in any
other non-Sterling currency including Euros please bear in mind that we
shall probably have to pay £5 of it to the bank.)

        xStream -- A NEW POETRY EZINE





xStream is a new ezine for experimental poetry. It is
more concentrated to procedural writing,
computer-generated texts, collage, found poems,
cut-ups etc, although any kind of poetry
is welcome.

xStream has also an experimental editing policy. All
submissions are handled automatically by computer and
some choices are machine-made.

Please submit your works between 1st and 4th of every
month, starting from April 2002. For Issue #0 you can
submit immediately, till 15th March 2002. Detailed
instructions from web site.

Because of the low budget I have constructed the web
site to free (Yahoo) site, so there are obligatory
ads.

In future I have planned to program the editing fully
automatic using self-adaptive neural networks and
other means, to see and experiment how well the
machine can do the job. So hopefully this is an ezine
which will continue publishing as long as there is
electricity (or Yahoo works).


Submissions to xstreamezine@yahoo.com.
Other contacts, comments, suggestions to
xstreameditor@yahoo.com.



Sincerely,

It is a laugh for people who are academics to write about a working class
poetics.  Most poets today in the USA are academics living on grants and
academic salaries. I am sorry but I have more respect for poets who are
elitists like Pound and Stevens and are at least honest about what they are.
Where in the working class base is poetry coming from??? There are some
great working class poets but they are in Brazil, China and Africa not the
MFA programs in the USA.

In fact, Ron, what *is* theocratic fascism?  I don't see either theocracy
(direct rule by a divine power) or fascism in the U.S.

Seems to kind of -- surely you don't intend this, but -- soften the
historical reality of fascism.

One of my dreams -- I am a simple person with uncomplicated dreams -- is to
visit Gwyn in D.C. and get high.

But then, I would likely visit any of you anywhere in order to get high, so
maybe this isn't about Gwyn.

Will somebody help me get high?

Hello---

I heard that there was some poetry event in NYC the other night
and I would like to hear, if possible, some versions of what happened.
I was told that it was some panel on performance poetry
(as oppossed to some performance on panelled poetry)
and that, at one point, Charles Bernstein was going on and on and not
letting others talk, and the audience was getting upset and
David Shapiro, who was also on the panel, at one point
HELD A CHAIR OVER BERNSTEIN'S HEAD (which
would sound violent if it were someone else and not say David Shapiro)
and it broke the tension, and people laughed.....
It almost sounds unbelievable, but I am curious if any of you were there
to confirm, or clarify
(sorry this is just too juicy to keep to myself....)

Chris

now i'm confused.m a chair on preformance poetry?
a chair on a performance poet?
a chair of performance poetry
a material basis for creativity?
not in words but in things?
actions speak louder?
etc.?

working is an action and as such is timeless I would think

credentials, class, who's in, games, etc., are another matter?

'anti-globalism' - lazy naming - it's at least 'anti-corporate
globalisation' and then listen to Braudel and now De Landa for the
emphasis on not 'capitalism' but anti-market activity to expose govt
subsidised trans-national corporate activity and so de-masking the

I meant "simple" in his dispensing of artifice, a "style" gained by learning
the craft of newspaper. I'm thinking here of what might be considered his
transition..."Brooklynianna"...prepared as a single unit, having the
continuity not found in his other journalism. He wasn't working against his
usual newspaper deadline. He may have even considered putting it out as a
book, but ended up putting it out in the papers. His "chant", expanded and
clipped, that sentence is there: "Manhattan Island, sterile and sandy, on a
foundation of rock, was not an inviting looking spot, but bleak, sterile,
and rough."
From working  this through I think he learned the power of the occasional
archaic spellings and punctuations he carried into his poetry.

In reference to jean chris, my tendency is towards pessimism; I would
conjoin the "If" piece I sent to Poetics last, to the series of quota-
tions. It seems to me that disaster is taking over the world; I know of no
defense but a certain delineation, or raising of the first, or crying out
in articulate manner. At Rhode Island School of Design years ago I taught
a course, The Year 3000, in futurism; I am seeing the rather pessimistic
conclusions reached at that point (from The Year 2000 report on), come
true, more or less, tottering as the world totters.

There is no apocalyypse; there never will be - just a slow dying, what you
can see in almost any wilderness world-wide.

And there is no myth perhaps - in the U.S. we're inundated with myth, but
the socio-political horizon is void...

********************************************
Some Notes Towards Last Night's Conversation

Text as text is uninterruptible tyranny. Poetry
is failure. Tyranny as text is poetry. Poetry is
uninterruptible. Poetry is terrible. Interrupting
terror, words in postmodernity are injected with
meaning the way "foodness" is injected into a Big
Mac (tm). Meaning, with injected postmodernity,
is part of the blue print (sic) of poetry. Its
architecture is inherently unstable.

"The rise of capitalism parallels the advance of
romanticism..."
- John Ashbery.

Poetry is the refutation of purity, so don't
shoot until you see the whites of their lives.
Reader =3D Text. All the right space at the white
margins. In the margins of the book I purchased
there are notes written in black pen for the
first thirty pages. I guess they ran outta steam,
or maybe were so taken by the spell of the text,
they were overcome and could write no more. Maybe
they were interrupted with a very important phone
call.

"Too many poets are like middle aged mothers
trying to get their kids to eat too much cooked
meat..."
- Frank O'Hara

The better you get, the more some uppity youngin'
wants to see if you are as fast on the draw as
everyone says. So you might as well lay low, wait
for all your enemies to ping each other off in
the crossfire, so you can escape town with the
gold, the horses, and if you are lucky, the
school-marm.

"At a Dada exhibition in Dusseldorf, I was
impressed that though Schwitters and Picabia and
the others had all become artists with the
passing of time, Duchamp's work remained
unacceptable as art."
- John Cage

The parallel of romanticism is asylum.
Neo-Formalism is stage hypnosis attempting to
convince you that the last one-hundred and fifty
years of poetry, the best parts of it anyways,
did not occur. "When you wake up, you will giggle
with rapturous glee at a well transposed trochee
and iambic foot." If I shoot myself in the iambic
foot, maybe I can avoid the draft. I cannot read
a sonnet for the same reason I cannot enter the
abode of someone over the age of seventy-five
without familial duties being involved in some
way. I am certain I am losing much wisdom in
this, but the smell!

"We didn't teach verse writing skills. We were
all emotionally bankrupt and went around asking
the students for love.
- Allen Ginsberg

There are only so many open spaces available in
this racket. If one in ten million people were
poets, and each poet wrote a volume of poems
every ten years, you would have to read a
thousand books of poetry a year just to keep up.
A book of poems for breakfast. A book of poems
for lunch. A book of poems for dinner. C'est
impossible! My math could be wrong on that. Yeats
was bad at math, too, and Einstein was, according
to the legend, a poor speller. Physics knows
nothing of language.

The fall of John Ashbery parallels with the
advance of Neo-Formalism.

"You wouldn't believe how much television is
purely Satanic."
- Overheard at a local soup kitchen

John Cage's mesostics are the most pure poems of
this century. They are total gestures that
re-align all previous understandings of text.
There has to be a way to make things better for
everybody. Rhyme =3D Regression. Slant Rhyme =3D
Joyful Detour. Poetry is not an experience. It is
the clear solution into which language is
dissolved (de-solved). Calm and cool panoptics
intensity. Poetry as compared to music is sadly
lacking. It fails on the level of pure
abstraction. The only upside about this is that
poetry can be utterly indigestible. Pound's
"Cantos" are a precursor to digitalized, sampled
electronica compositions. The essence of
capitalism is the presence of places wherein you
are not permitted to wear jeans after a certain
hour.

The rise of workshop verse parallels the advance
of the automobile.

"The kind of poetry I want is not a happy art
with uplifting messages and easy to understand
emotions. I want a poetry that's bad for you."
-Charles Bernstein

A poet may wish to write utterly personal poems
anyone might have written. Anthologies are filled
with such poems. Anthologies are the cryogenic
stasis of poetry, hurtling through the universe
(universities) in a well-built rocket ship.
Plain text is the best font of all. Enjoy poetry,
you will never get to read enough of it, after
all. Poetry is a joy. Sometimes it manages to be
nearly as good as television. Know that you
exist, and enjoy the contours of your mind. Don't
strain too hard. Read "The Art of Poetry" by
Kenneth Koch. That should take you as much time
as watching a sitcom, though you can do both,
reading the poem during the commercials. Don't
parody yourself. Text =3D Interlocutory Cremation
(sometimes). Don't call yourself an angel for not
"selling out" when no-one is buying. Capitalism
will catch up with you soon enough. Meaning is a
plastic baggie used to carry home a fish. Clear,
malleable, plastic, imprisoning, revealing, and
provisional.

I'll shut up now.

I think that the internet assumes a sort of community that is potentially
possible through printed word, but has not been possible due to patriarchal
and unidirectional reading strategies.  We've learned to experience text in
isolation.  It is not absoultely so.  I'm sitting in front of my computer
screen, alone, after a night out at a poetry reading, all my housemates are
asleep.  How is this not in isolation?  The imagination fills in a person at
the other end of this emissary, perhaps even a group of people, and yet is
this any more real than assuming answers from text?  from imagining an other
while reading whether it is author, narrator, or self.  Responses do come
in, and so this illusion of contact and community is upheld against the
notion of isolation and reading of static book, however it is merely
illusory since all I respond to is text, not person, not personality, only
words.  You don't know me.  The potentialities of the web don't suddenly
liberate us from experiencing text in isolation, and I think it is possible
to excercise the same imaginary powers that posit a person at the
compositional moment of the text you are reading right now to formulate an
other from a static text.  Neither format brings people closer, or inserts a
body into discourse, however if reading practices can be altered from the
learned condition of isolated learning/reading, then it is perhaps possible
to imagine this community materializing through either methodology of
composition, web or static page.

The web presumes a certain breaking with time, or an instatement of local
and eventual, as in predicated on a notion of event based time.  This
appears to collapse the space between my computer in Calgary, Alberta,
Canada, and a computer in Buffalo, New York.  Does it really though, or is
this just a further illusion?  If I'm reading a novel written by Charles
Dickens, can I pretend that because he invokes England the space between my
reading and his England is skirted?  We could also apply this notion to
time.  If I send an email to say hello to a friend at seven in the morning
and I get a response at seven the next morning, does it really matter when
it was composed?  When I read the email for the first time, see it drop onto
my computer, then it is happening regardless of when it was written.  This
is a further illusion that could again be attached to a notion of reading
Dickens as a time-collapsor.

I think there are many opportunities offered by web
art/writing/conceptualization, however it is dangerous to forgo the notions
arrived at in contemporary writing and seek a false liberation in new
formats.  Neither form allows for a sharing of text.  However, both allow
for the illusion of community and dialogue.  It just requires different acts
of imagination.

But their circumstances are quite different: (I'm responding to RB) eg one
would expect the poetry of an African poet to be more politically "charged"
or intense. (Maybe also some poets in the West nowadays with the continuing
military action by Ashcroft, Bush etal).. Some poets in MFA programs may
also take to writing strong "working class" poetry...maybe though some
aspects of the programs "defuse" that side: but worse than MFA (perceived
"typical" of such) is equally the "bush poets" ... the poets who claim to
have learnt from "the university of ife" and are aggressively  "from the
heart" (and aggressively and deliberately ignorant of poetry except say some
John Masefield and some Longfellow or  Ella  Wheeler Wilcox) which means
they write drivel which actually is an insult to the intelligence of the
working class and anyone of any other class or type: an example would be
Brecht's powerful poems, some shatteringly direct: but looking over all his
work there are many 'experimental' and other kinds of poems (and plays of
course)...its not all "cut and dried" .... I know what you're "driving at"
but the world has room for many styles and approaches in art, music, poetry
etc. Regards, Richard.

Bill,

You touched important issues. No, I don't think the academy is a
"compensation" for poems. How many of the poets would get a job if they
represented themselves to the search committees without a Phd? In fact, the
academy reflects the relation between one's work and who is paying for it. In
subtle ways, it forces the poet to write ways which the literary environment
of that instotutions considers "good" poetry, "experimental" poetry, etc. A
genuinely new poetry, in that sense, may endenger one academic career.

It is true that anthologies (and critical writings which quote poems) sell
quite well. But that money goes mostly to publishers, not the poets. As Ed
Foster pointed out, a poem is worth more as a quotation than as a poem.

Making money out of the reading of one's poems is the nearest thing to one's
being paid for the poetic labor. But how many poets can make a living out of
these readings? Generously, the average payment for a reading is 150/250
dollars (Allen Ginsberg made I think about 2000). One needs at least
20,000.00 a year (in the States) to live. How many of us can give, let's say,
100 readings a year. I would go crazy, and nobody would ask many of us to
give that many anyway. What about the time we spent writing the poems?
Besides, if one gave a hundred readings, what kind of poems will one end up
writing, both to satisfy that schedule and draw the audience for it?
What you say is viable for a specific kind of performance poetry -like jazz-
where the poet improvises around themes during the performance, where the
writing and performing of the poem are one.

The point I am making is that for whom the poem is being writing is crucial
in determining the form and content (indirectly the class) of the poem. And,
since for most poets a poem has no economic viability, a poem is not a
product, writing it not a production; but a consumption. A poet very often
must steal time (from productive economic activity, like addicts do) to write
his or her poetry. Writing poetry subverts labor, is an anti-productive
activity. It is done mainly for the experience, the thrill of writing it,
compulsively, against labor. If so, a poem is a process, not a product, not a
craft; an impulse to start constantly from scratch, to reinvent the wheel.
This is very liberating but also surrounded with doom, a subversion of
economic value systems. In my view, this is the class status of the poet in
the United States: a compulsive consumer, "working" against economic reason,
like the gin drinkers in England during the industrial revolutions or
alcoholics or cocaine addicts.

\\ MA NEWSLETTER DU DIMANCHE n°004 \\
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SOMMAIRE :

1 - PIECE 1.3. -
2 - SCOLIE a -
3 - CONFERENCE d) -
4 - SCOLIE b -
5 - CONFERENCE e) -
6 - REFERENCE -
7 - SCOLIE c -

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - PIECE 1.3. - L'expéditeur pourrait être un pervers, un aliéné, un serial-
killer. Parce qu'il peut être aussi bien quelqu'un de très aimable, avec ce que
cela comporte de mielleux. Vous semblez de toute façon le faire avancer, pour
être dépositaire d'un message pareil, y étant forcément pour quelque chose,
vous vous devez d'aider à son élucidation : d'une part, c'est quelqu'un qui
pourrait devenir très dangereux sans les recommandations qui vous sont
propres ; d'autre part, il pourrait en ressortir une relation des plus
décisives de votre vie ou de votre siècle.
Ce qui reste sans compter que : rien n'est définitif (à cause des possibles).

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2 - SCOLIE a - Ne serait-ce que pour s'en porter garant, il est bon de
retenir que cela ne va pas sans fessée : d'une soif de tendresse intacte,
immense, magnifique, et puis exposée aux coups de fouet du besoin, du
sacrifice, du fantasme et des gestes insensés qui mentent à l'amour et
trahissent ses revers. C'est un ouvrage, à part entière, n'est donc pas de tout
divertissement, sans doute pas aussi documentaire qu'il n'y paraît, de son
genre encyclopédique : ringards et branchouilles sont égaux devant la loi de
l'éternel demi-recommencement / version remixée / les civilisés, frustrés,
jouent d'auto-proclamations dominicales pour gagner en noblesse et faire de
l'aristocratie indus' avec de la dignité para-commerciale.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3 - CONFERENCE d) - Ce qui me regarde, c'est de me sentir bien avec vous, c'est
l'occasion qui veut ça : j'ai pensé qu'il serait bon pour ça que j'enregistre
la partie de clarinette du Sacre du Printemps d'Igor Stravinsky et que
l'enregistrement de cette partition reste entre vous et moi tout le temps de
cette conférence. C'est pourquoi cette conférence doit durer le temps de la
partition. C'est pourquoi je tiens à dire qu'il n'y a rien de provocateur et
surtout rien de scandaleux à cette occasion. D'une part, le Sacre du Printemps
a déjà été l'occasion de faire péter un scandale et la partie de clarinette a
eu son rôle à jouer dans cette affaire et puisqu'il doit s'agir une affaire, il
ne m'appartient pas de revenir dessus. Certains considérerons qu'il y a des
fois où c'est l'occasion de faire péter un scandale Je dirai que ceux-là
n'arrivent pas quand il faut : étant donné que nous sommes encore dans la
première partie de l'enregistrement, il est encore trop tôt pour trancher ce
qui fera l'objet précis de cette conférence, si vous voulez qu'il soit celui-
là, vous pouvez le vouloir, mais ça ne fera pas avancer le propos.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4 - SCOLIE b - Il est toujours de bon ton de décider que les têtes de file des
musiques très nouvelles, s'il en est, pour être devenues des vedettes - parce
que l'échelle de leur notoriété enfin leur échappe - sorties des murs crissants
de l'underground, sentant un avenir plus assuré, se seraient détendues et
feraient leur travail sans broncher qu'on ne l'écoute pas assez : ainsi
entendus, il va de toute évidence que l'électro et le rock n'ont plus lieu de
rivaliser, ils peuvent cacher, de leurs cernes de deuxième jeunesse, le chagrin
inavouable, la triste révélation, l'objet de leurs batailles, l'audience.
Sur le compte des fortes décisions très en prise avec le doux dosage de la
sérennité et de quelques stigmates d'une modernité juste ce qu'il en faut, un
consensus humaniste mais post-indus' consiste à déclarer que l'électronique est
technique, moins important que ce qui en est fait, que ce que ça va devenir.
Il y aurait tout lieu de se demander à qui profite un tel compromis si les
figures les incarnant, déjà vues de plus près, ne distribuaient des nuances
déjà moins mondaines : à la soustraction de l'ego devant la musique et ses
nouveautés incontournables, revient l'hédonisme des dance-floors pour ne
flatter les pieds qu'après un bain, bourré en mélancolie.

Mais tant que ça ne résiste pas à la sociologie, c'est de la gnognotte.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5 - CONFERENCE e) - Ce qui m'intéresse pour l'occasion n'est pas tant de faire
avancer le propos, ce serait calamiteux, mais surtout, cela pourrait devenir
officiellement calamiteux, l'heure n'est pas aux caractères officiels. Je
préférerai oeuvrer pour me sentir bien et si vous voulez que ce soit une belle
conférence, il faut ça. Tout le monde a pu vivre un concert où un
instrumentiste ne se sentait plus dès le début et tout le long et sans que cela
n'empêche le bon déroulement et le caractère formidable ou la grâce
extraordinaire du concert. Seulement, pour ce qui concerne les conditions
présentes, il est plus pratique que je me sente. Et plutôt tendu s'il le faut
Pour l'occasion : Plus je me détendrai vers la fin
et Plus cela pourra paraître comme une résolution
Sinon qu'une résolution se veut toujours un peu scandaleuse /
C'est facile : C'est trop tôt / Ah / Ah

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6 - REFERENCE - "Rien ne fait plus penser à une boutique de brocanteur que ce
recueil de vers publié par M. Guillaume Apellinaire sous un titre à la fois
simple et mystérieux : Alcools.
Je dis : boutique de brocanteur parce qu'il est venu échouer dans ce taudis une
foule d'objets hétéroclites dont certains ont de la valeur, mais dont aucun
n'est le produit de l'industrie du marchand même. C'est bien là une des
caractéristiques de la brocante : elle revend ; elle ne fabrique pas. Elle
revend d'ailleurs parfois de curieuses choses ; il se peut qu'on trouve, dans
ses étalages crasseux, une pierre de prix montée sur un clou. Tout cela vient
de loin ; mais la pierre est agréable à voir. Pour le reste, c'est un
assemblage de faux tableaux, de vêtements exotiques et rapiécés, d'accessoires
pour bicyclettes et d'instruments d'hygiène privée. Une truculente et
étourdissante variété tient lieu d'art, dans un assemblage des objets. C'est à
peine si, par les trous d'une chasuble miteuse, on aperçoit le regard ironique
et candide du marchand, qui tient à la fois du juif levantin, de l'Américain du
Sud, du gentilhomme polonais et du facchino."
(extrait d'un article de Georges Duhamel, paru dans le Mercure de France du 16
juin 1913, reproduit par M. Décaudin dans Le Dossier d' "Alcools", pp. 49-50,
Librairies Droz et Minard, 1965)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

7 - SCOLIE c - Tant de vitalité n'exclut pas une hypocondrie aiguë. Si un
proche est susceptible de s'en véxer, il reste possible de vous extraire de sa
compagnie comme de toute situation pouvant aliéner votre hypocondrie. Prévoyez,
parmi les diversions les plus sympathiques et rafraîchissantes, que leurs
auteurs sont mués par une seule obsession : ce qui vous attache à leur style,
étant exclu que vous ne l'aimiez pas, tant vous profitez déjà de son
déversement pour papoter. Cultivez les recommandations : une simple adresse,
une sorte d'impasse, électronique. Les bons tuyaux, à l'heure d'internet,
gagnent leurs fresques éditoriales des adresses qui les acheminent. Ils
permettent de raffermir des amitiés sans avoir à prendre part aux destinations
et à leurs supplices. Ne pas compter sur l'amitié vous permet de vous reposer,
vous épargnant les bavasseries et tout ce qui, verbeux et possessif, nuit
gravement à la santé.

Say ... You want a Revolution??? [PARA]






Imagine what it would be like
if you could control people's worlds from the palm of your hand -
and had the power to contact, feel secure and influence them to agree to
practically anything you propose ...


                                what would that be worth to you?


In this manner, your reader is a voluntary and willing participant, and
becomes happily involved in a decision that you have rendered painless and
even enjoyable. Here's the amazing part: You can initiate your reader's
absorption sequence at the snap of your fingers when you know the secret
codes known as "Tantalum."  These Tantalum activate a human predisposition
within the reader without any resistance.


Geoffrey Gatza mastered the clever use of Tantalum throughout his career,
and came up with legendary successes that broke many of the poetic track
records of his time. I dare you to use Tantalum in your writing, and create
legendary successes of your own.  Take this challenge NOW
.


Obviously, these Tantalum usher in a revolutionary - and immensely more
effective - era of poetry.  Here's how Tantalum compares to the traditional
way of poetry:

Traditional Poetry entails the use of absorption "scripts" that are both
awkward and unnatural.  You probably know them all - dozens of memorized
closes, questions rigged with "tie-down" lines that trick the reader into
saying "yes," etc.  This traditional poetry sequence is contrived, and goes
against the natural flow of the reader.  And even when readers are thrilled
as a result of these high-pressure tactics, it's not because they want the
product but because they are cornered or intimidated into the sale.  I don't
know about you, but this absorption model makes me feel like a con artist
after I read the piece.



[NL]Poetry With the Use of Tantalum:  When you "get into the mind" of your
reader, the absorption process becomes a matter of just pushing the right
buttons - or more precisely, the right Tantalum.  Since you're going with
your reader's natural flow, and using a poetry sequence to which your reader
is naturally inclined, you eliminate any resistance.  Poetry couldn't be
easier.[PARA]



How Tantalum Were Discovered




Geoffrey Gatza, the best-selling poetry author and eccentric editor of
BlazeVOX2K2 who achieved legendary fame in avant garde poetics, ran a highly
successful mail-order journal in the 1980s, UP&P (ut pictura poesis).
Geoffrey learned on a mass scale which approaches worked, and which ones
didn't.  He studied the poems that achieved a high degree of success, and
discovered that they were clearly successful because of certain underlying
Tantalum.  He identified 30 of these Tantalum that activate forces buried
deep within the subconscious brain, and cause people to yearn.


In his new ebook Tantalum Geoffrey reveals his startling discovery of how to
get into people's minds, eavesdrop on their thoughts, know what they want -
and make a fortune in the process.



[NL]I'm going to give you a little caveat right here - so listen closely.
[PARA][PARA]When you start poetry with the use of Tantalum, your absorption
results will be so amazing that you won't want to write any other way.
Poetry has never been easier, so easy in fact that you won't want to go back
to your old way of poetry ever again!  [NL][NL]When you get your hands on
Tantalum I am betting you won't be able to put it down.  In fact, I'm
betting that I couldn't pry it out of your hands if I tried. Tantalum is
overflowing with the most mouth-watering secrets you absolutely must
have.[NL]


Cracking the Code That Reveals Untold Secrets




Just as the human genome cracked the genetic code that reveals untold
secrets of the human body, Geoffrey Gatza's Tantalum cracked the code that
activates a person's excitement sequence.  This is the secret code that has
eluded the poetry industry for years.


Folks, this is not the kind of poetry you grew up with. This is quantum
poetry that goes beyond anything you've ever seen or heard. Geoffrey Gatza
first discovered the power of Tantalum years ago when he applied to just one
Macarthur Fellowship, and it immediately doubled the response to his body of
work.


Here's the good news: [NL][NL]Now that you realize that applying powerful
Tantalum today will turbo-charge your writing to incalculable heights,
you'll be surprised to learn that you can have Tantalum for a very small
investment of only $29.95.  Within 15 minutes, you will receive download and
unlock information that will allow you to read Geoffrey Gatza's Tantalum
online. You can apply one or more of the  Tantalum to your absorption and
poetic activities today, and literally generate absorption before the day is
over.  [NL][NL]Try it now, risk-free.  If you are not satisfied, just let me
know within 30 days and I will issue a no-hassle refund. Although it is
highly unlikely that you would be anything less than thrilled with Tantalum
should you decide to request a refund, the free bonus, Secrets of the
Written Word is yours to keep and enjoy as my gift just for taking me up on
this offer.[NL]

I like this idea of the poem as anti-product, poet as anti-laborer; I'm not
so sure about the addiction analogy.  Is it a _consumption_, or more of a
refusal of same?  To _consume_ is to acquiesce to a cycle of production,
commercial interpellation, etc.  Poetry (at least the poetry I have in mind=
)
blocks up the orifices of that consuming organism.  It's a
deterritorializing activity.  As such it offers no easy narcotic
gratification either to the "producer" or to the "consumer" (which can be
one and the same).  In fact, this could be a gauge of "good" vs. "bad"
poetry on an politico-economically conceived scale of value: does it simply
reproduce the terms of an odious hegemony, satisfying expectations that hav=
e
been instilled in order to maintain an inanely self-fulfilling mass
aesthetics, or does it stage a public demonstration that interferes with
assembly-line productivity and fast-food ideology?  Protests and
demonstrations might be another kind of activity that falls into this
anti-labor category: although they involve the same physical work,
intellectual energy, etc., as "official" labor, they consciously position
themselves as _in reference to_ or _as exceptions to_ that labor, and
therefore outside of it.  Narcotic addiction, on the other hand, however
much it may perform the incidental and temporary function of disrupting
labor, is first and foremost an individual's _escape_ from the system, and
as such is illusory, even counter-effective.  Poetry, on the other hand,
because it is conscious of its illusoriness, allows for the potential of
resistant engagement from some new perspective or vantage.  The poet knows
he is not "really" a body without organs, whereas the junkie may very well
forget his or her body exists at all, and thus leaves it open to continued
penetration by noxious entities (both the ones he or she has chosen to
ingest, and the ones that made the addiction seem desirable in the first
place).

The poet offers a poem in the shape of a needle, but always knows (and
reminds you too) that there is no junk in it, which is both the problem and
the blessing....

Bill,

You touched important issues. No, I don't think the academy is a
"compensation" for poems. How many of the poets would get a job if they
represented themselves to the search committees without a Phd? In fact, the
academy reflects the relation between one's work and who is paying for it. In
subtle ways, it forces the poet to write ways which the literary environment
of that instotutions considers "good" poetry, "experimental" poetry, etc. A
genuinely new poetry, in that sense, may endenger one academic career.

It is true that anthologies (and critical writings which quote poems) sell
quite well. But that money goes mostly to publishers, not the poets. As Ed
Foster pointed out, a poem is worth more as a quotation than as a poem.

Making money out of the reading of one's poems is the nearest thing to one's
being paid for the poetic labor. But how many poets can make a living out of
these readings? Generously, the average payment for a reading is 150/250
dollars (Allen Ginsberg made I think about 2000). One needs at least
20,000.00 a year (in the States) to live. How many of us can give, let's say,
100 readings a year. I would go crazy, and nobody would ask many of us to
give that many anyway. What about the time we spent writing the poems?
Besides, if one gave a hundred readings, what kind of poems will one end up
writing, both to satisfy that schedule and draw the audience for it?
What you say is viable for a specific kind of performance poetry -like jazz-
where the poet improvises around themes during the performance, where the
writing and performing of the poem are one.

The point I am making is that for whom the poem is being writing is crucial
in determining the form and content (indirectly the class) of the poem. And,
since for most poets a poem has no economic viability, a poem is not a
product, writing it not a production; but a consumption. A poet very often
must steal time (from productive economic activity, like addicts do) to write
his or her poetry. Writing poetry subverts labor, is an anti-productive
activity. It is done mainly for the experience, the thrill of writing it,
compulsively, against labor. If so, a poem is a process, not a product, not a
craft; an impulse to start constantly from scratch, to reinvent the wheel.
This is very liberating but also surrounded with doom, a subversion of
economic value systems. In my view, this is the class status of the poet in
the United States: a compulsive consumer, "working" against economic reason,
like the gin drinkers in England during the industrial revolutions or
alcoholics or cocaine addicts.

Murat, most of what you say here makes sense to me.  As I said in my last
post, few poets achieve the status of a Ginsberg (who died a millionaire).
But I think you're splitting hairs on the product/process thing.  Music is
quite obviously a process, but it is also packaged and sold.  If the
distinction rests on whether or not the artists can anticipate financial
reward, then most creative activities do not yield products.  Most
architects, for example, never see their designs gracing a skyline, nor do
they get paid very much for them.  They are more likely to provide grunt work
for some firm.  But that doesn't change the fact that a skyscraper is a
product.  Likewise, most poets cannot expect much financial reward.  They
create because they are driven through the process by their own talent and
interests -- but the poem is nevertheless a product which can be delivered
within two covers, or on a screen.  Creating the product involves process, of
course, as does experiencing (reading) the product, much as designing the
skyscraper, or walking through it's rooms and hallways, does.  I think you
may be setting two things against each other that are not actually in
conflict.  Poetry is a product that is not all that welcome in our society,
unlike in some other societies.  But some products sell, and some don't.

Would you claim, for instance, that the writing of novels does not involve a
product because most novelists do not make money and novels in the main are
not economically viable?  A few novels make big bucks, right?  Publishers are
willing to dump a lot of this product on the market in the hope that some of
it will sell.  Some poetry does sell.  Determining the product nature of a
text according to how well it sells seems to put the cart before the horse.
If it's available for sale, or consumption in any way, it's a product.  We
might even argue that the poet who stands before an audience is a product
generated by his texts, and at the same time a process that must be
experienced in time.  Best, Bill

this may be a tangent, but I was reminded today somewhat harshly that being
a parent never ends.

BEING a poet never ends.

BEING alive never ends.

it might help clarify things to distinguish between working class and the
working class ethic.  I have a prospective son-in-law who subscribes to the
'ethic' that a woman's place is in the house but time will tell if he works
and brings home the bacon?

I think that this discussion of a working class poetics has merit.  The
problem is who is having the discussion on a working class poetics;
academics.   I worked in Latin America for 8 years first in Bolivia and then
in Brazil.  I worked for an NGO working with inmates in prision.
The people that I worked with were truly working class, that means that they
had no savings, working with their bodies for a living doing hard, dirty
jobs and they were caught int a cycle of employment violence that lead them
to dispair but also to push for real social change.  I am genuinely
interested in what these folks have to say poetically.  The problem is that
I do not share their lives and most
writers of poetry and fiction today do not share these lives either. these
people have no voice and I cannot create one for them because I do not share
their struggles.

Even a poet who is radical like Amiri Baraka is more in the Middle Class
because of the fact that they do not live in that type of world.  The
problem is that we objectivfy  what should be a subject, people who work
hard.  I would challenge people to think about this when talking about a
poetic of work.

Murat. In further comment.The Marxist definition(s) of the world I think are
useful and (in many aspects) true enough: but big areas of human activity
and thought are not discussed - especially by the kind of "hard-atheists" or
"hard Materialists". (I cant be either of those). The latter - I'm using
Materialist in its philosophic sense as opposed to Idealist ) would probably
not have much time for the subtleties of whether a poem was a
"product"...but to summarise a bit crudely at this stage: that is partly the
reason that the Soviet system failed well before even Stalin came to power:
or it was headed for disastor...that is kind of fanatic observance of
Marxism without the realisation that religion, for example, has its place,
and so does various kinds of art:  other factors were the invasion by the
West: sabortage from within and without, Revisionism, the 2 WW and so on. In
fact the French and Russian revolutions were  in many ways revolutions to
facilitate the advent of Capitalism. Maybe also in some repects the Chinese
revolution...
  But the class analysis of Marx and much of his philosophy is still very
vital today.
   As to the product of the poet: as a poet I dont think about those things
much. Sure, I value what I've done, but I just get on with it. I'm not
pessimistic (neccessarily
- or at least I dont see "our times" in a way (sub specie aeternitatis) as
any worse (or better) than any other: granted we as the "Great European
Culture" have produced at least two monumentaly barbaric wars of which those
of the East (except Japan) cant boast their equal: but that aside I dont
think we are nearing the "end" (although I suppose we could be)) but I dont
have much hope for my or most peoples' poetry having much influence on
anyone or anything: visual and other arts and pop music and sex and movies
and videos and television and sport seem to get all the publicity, which I
suppose is natural: and poets are doomed to struggle alone...and yet I
believe that we are: "The unacknowledged
legislators of the world."  And strangely, also, I believe in the enormous
power of the word. Despite other media and what I've just said: the pen is
still mightier than the sword. Richard.

Wotan The Warrior





When I questioned Wotan as to their bio material they told me "being
the god(dess) of poetic inspiration, Wotan, is who I am, for better
or worse", so I left it at that.  Wotan has a story out in the current
(might be one issue back at this point) issue of E-corpse and stuff
forthcoming in Milk Magazine.  Their website can be found at
wotanswarriors@5u.com, and we have wotan@geek.com as an email address.



Biore Pore Strips

Fricka did those pore strips again the other night and they totally
pulled out all this little white hairy fuzz off her nose, chin
and chest -- though no pimple gook.   Then Romeo called and started
moaning about the pictures from the wedding.  She claimed you
could see her facial hair in the photo. She said, "I look like
Frieda Kalo!"
"Try Biore pore strips, that's what Fricka uses."
"Is that hair that comes out when you use those?  That can’t
be good!"
"It doesn't seem to happen to the other Valkyries," I admitted.
 Fricka is the only one, apparently, who has lots of white fuzz.
 Secretly,  I am rather concerned about this and wish I hadn't
known.  But I kept a breezy attitude up about it with Romeo.
"But, hey!  Try it! I'll send you one the next time she does
it."  Romeo agreed to go buy some and we agree to mail them to
each other in film canisters.
Before she hung up though, I said, "Don't bother to send yours
if there's nothing to see."

Fractured penis

There are other things I wish I hadn't known.  Take for instance
the fractured penis I picked up the other night.  You could have
gone your whole life without knowing that when fully erect, a
penis can be broken; am I right?  And that what you’re left with
is one heck of a sore and very bent penis? When the reconstructive
surgeon asked if the patient happened to have a picture of it
(before the mishap, that is), I couldn’t help but laugh.  Seemed
straight forward enough -- I mean,  I wouldn’t need a picture;
it’s bent - unbend it. Don’t make what’s simple hard.   "Can’t
they just use my yearbook picture?" the guy with the fractured
penis quipped.  At least he had a sense of humor about it.


Nostalgic

I remember how my mother would put my little brother in a tailor
tot in the back of the station wagon and tether him in so he
could roll around back there as we drove. I remember the time
she put him in the trunk but we could
still hear him screaming in there.

And once she did that with the dog, but he chewed out all the
headlight cable.





Excerpts from The Story of Wotan

Wotan hatched out as a fingerling rainbow trout during an April
snowstorm in the wilds of the Adirondacks -- practically, but
tragically, not quite Canada, and was promptly named after the
tallest mountain peak in the region. Raised by an extremely zany,
outdoorsy and artistic,  yet uptight Puritan couple -- I'm talking
"Pilgrim's Progress" here, Wotan was subjected to a lonely childhood
on a remote woodland farm, and knew far more many dogs and horses
than people in those formative pre-school years.

Going off to Kindergarten was a great relief to the lonely child
Wotan, for attracting young and old with a uniquely sunny aura
was Wotan's gift.  Wotan secured the love of  classmates by drawing
Ski-doos for the boys and sunbonnet babies for the girls.  Right
from the get go, Wotan was in big demand.

For Immediate Release:


      Creative Arts Café Poetry Series Springs into Women’s Month
                   Poets: Marj Hahne, Suzanne Cleary,
                  Sally Bliumis and Marilyn A. Johnson



Mt. Kisco, NY: March brings Spring and the celebration of the
achievements of women. The Creative Arts Café Poetry Series honors women
in the arts with a month long selection of women poets. March 11th
begins with Philadelphia  poet Marj Hahne followed by March 18th Poet
Suzanne Cleary celebrating her new book Keeping Time (Carnegie Melon U.
Press, 2002). Both readings begin at 7:30 PM in the Art Gallery at NWCA
and are followed by a reception and an open mike. March 20th, NWCA goes
to the Flying Pig Farm Market Café at the Mt. Kisco Train Station to
celebrate the first day of Spring with Poets Sally Bliumis and Marilyn A
Johnson. The reading at the Flying Pig begins at 7:00PM and is followed
by an open mike.

Marj Hahne is a poet and an educator. Recently transplanted from
Philadelphia to New York City, she teaches poetry workshops to children
and adults at schools, museums, bookstores, and conferences. She has
performed her poetry in Philadelphia, New York, and San Francisco, and
will be reading in Texas this April.  Marj has been published in
"Painted Bride Quarterly," "Mad Poets Review," "La Petite Zine," "Bum
Rush the Page: A Def Poetry Jam Anthology," and a forthcoming anthology,
"Decades of a Woman."  She has also self-published two collections of
poetry, "Finding What Hides" and "Remembrance: for September 11, 2001"
(7WenchesPress), and is recording a spoken
word CD. Sharon Olds best expresses for Marj why she writes and teaches
poetry and why she shares what she writes:  "To the poet, the human
community is like the community of birds to a bird, singing to each
other. Love is one of the reasons we are singing to one another, love of
language itself, love of sound, love of singing itself, and love of the
other birds."  Marj wants to (re)awaken people to the restorative power
of words, that is, to poetry as another mode of artistic expression that
can embolden people toward real self-empowerment and ultimately toward a
collective healing.

Award Winning Poet Suzanne Cleary is the author of a new book Keeping
Time (Pittsburgh Carnegie Mellon U Press, 202). She is recipient of
numerous awards including: Artist’s Residency in Poetry, Vermont Studio
Center, 2000; the Arvon International Poetry Competition, 1992 and
1998;  Emerging Poets Competition, Aldrich Museum, 1996; New Letters
Poetry Award, 1994; Poetry Society of America Cecil Hemley Memorial
Award, 1993; Southern Poetry Review Guy Owen Award, 1992; NY Foundation
for the Arts Artist’s Fellowship in Poetry,  1987. Born and raised in
Binghampton NY, Suzanne Cleary earned an MA is Writing from Washington U
and Ph.D. in Literature and Criticism from Indiana University of PA.
Her poems and book reviews have appeared in many journals.  Dr. Cleary
is associate Professor of English Literature at Manhattanville College.

Readings by Poets Sally Bliumis and Marilyn A. Johnson will be at the
Flying Pig Farm Market Café as part of the monthly collaborative
readings between NWCA and the Flying Pig Café. The March 20th reading

this may not be as simple as it seems;  i have the power to hire and
fire my student assistant--it is a ten-hour a week position....
(sometimes it's an undergard,  at the moment a graduate student)
..obviously she does not depend on it for her livlihood....  and
hopes to go on to a primarily intellectual and middle-class career;
but at the same time,  anyone who works that much while going to
school & (not least here at this university, where most of the
students are affluent)  definitely has had to make some tough
decisions...  there are many intermediate class  postions,  is my
point..  one of the great things about the wooblies is the
straightfoward simplicity of their analysis and strategy and goals
(they continue into the present some of the best elements of
working-class revolutionary activism,  ones which are generally
shunned and dissed by intellectuals,  who in the past (in the US)
were often trained to despise anarchism..1989 began to alter this);
but that clarity and simplicity are also in my opinion part of their
weakness...

--one person at least,  has mentioned,  as part of this thread, that
it is a redux (re-do) of earlier similar threads.. several lurkerish
friends have also mentioned this to me;  ... in turn,  and i'm
probably not the first to say this,  i'm struck by how intense the
discussion is,  when the list in recent years cannot sustain actual
discussions of poetics (officially,  its focus)...  this exchange has
sometimes been excellent,  sometimes treading water....   but it is
remarkable that poetry and poetix are not capable of sustaining such
energy and interest...  my guess,  1.  there is at this moment a lack
of shared tools,  for exploration of issues regarding poetry,  among
the population that is currently inhabiting the list.. and,  of
course (as has often been noted),  2.  a checkered history of flame
wars and meltdowns make people here gun-shy about issues that might
generate ego clashes,  and it appears that talking about the thing we
share most intensely does just that; ... this second point interests
me very much;  because i suspect it says something about the feel
that the poetry community has right now:  one of unease, distrust,
and a lack of respect and supportiveness beyong small personal
circles..

US 'has nuclear hit list'


"First use" has been unthinkable for years

The Bush administration has reportedly ordered the Pentagon to prepare
contingency plans for attacking seven countries with nuclear weapons.
Quoting a secret Pentagon report, the Los Angeles Times newspaper names
China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria as potential
targets.


I can imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the UN-Joseph
Cirincione, nuclear arms expert

Furthermore, the military have apparently been directed to build smaller
nuclear weapons for battlefield use.
The Pentagon has declined to comment on the report which analysts have
described as "dynamite".
According to the paper, the report lists three situations in which the
weapons could be used.
These include "retaliation for attack with nuclear, biological or chemical
weapons" and "against targets able to withstand non-nuclear attack".
The third category - "in the event of surprising military developments" - is
described by the BBC's Washington correspondent, Paul Reynolds, as a
"catch-all" clause.
The paper says the report was presented by the Pentagon to members of
Congress on Friday.
It is quoted as saying the Pentagon should be ready to use nuclear weapons
in an Arab-Israeli conflict, a war between China and Taiwan and an attack by
North Korea on the South.
As for Russia, the report says that it is only listed in view of its own
large nuclear arsenal and it is not viewed as an enemy.
'Taboo lifted'
Defence analysts told the Los Angeles Times that the secret report appeared
to mark the first time an official list of target countries had come to
light.
"I can imagine what these countries are going to be saying at the UN," said
Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear arms expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington.


Dr Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon-John Isaacs arms
control campaigner

The report clearly referred to nuclear arms as a "tool for fighting a war,
rather than deterring them", he added.
Anti-nuclear campaigners pointed out that the reported instruction to build
new tactical nuclear weapons indicated that the administration of George W
Bush was more willing to lift the old taboo on using nuclear weapons except
as a last resort.
"This is very, very dangerous talk," said John Isaacs, president of the
Council for a Livable World.
"Dr Strangelove is clearly still alive in the Pentagon," he commented,
referring to a 1964 feature film about a nightmare nuclear conflict between
the US and the Soviet Union.
Our correspondent recalls that the US made a veiled threat to Iraq during
the Gulf War that it could respond with nuclear weapons to an attack by
Baghdad using chemical or biological weapons.

the midst of golden orb and shield spiders. later, poison ivy wound its

of a pine. these hunkered down in solution holes surrounded by alligator

than ever. they're condensations of angels; they will light the way. rain

and no rain coming. land's end and delineation of the rest of the world,

we're pushed to the edge, land's end, down in the water, we're returning

we're thrown to a halt, run out, stop traffic. she's sitting there. we

gets up hissing, trots off, we get back in the car, take off. there's

everglades deer ahead on the right - elusive in these parts, they run off.

I am leading a poetry writing workshop for some mentally ill peopple who've
asked me to (already did a workshop reading poems), and I  hope you can give
me some advice...  There should be 5-10 p[articiplants (there were 6-7 at
the reading workshop I did).  I have taught before, but over the net, and
I'm used to doing eight week courses where people have time to write their
poems and don't have to produce them on the spot...

I'd like to do concrete poetry.  What I really want for this are those
Letraset letters that transfer onto a page that graphic designers used to
use before computers.  Does anyone know if these are still available?  I'd
like to buy sheets of differently sized and colored letters so that people
can really play around.  The things still existed in the early 90's when I
was fond of using them as labels in diagrams I did for math homework, but I
wonder if they are all gone now...  You used to be able to get hundreds of
different fonts and sizes and doodads and so on.

Secondly, does anyone know of an anthology of concrete poetry?  I showed
them last time some really cook layouts (although they are supposedly
"prose") from Kenneth Patchen's _Sleeper's Awake_, and I have the anthology
edited by Rothenberg and Joris which has some, but I am looking for examples
that require a small number of letters so that they can be inspiration for
something you could do in half an hour or a little more...

The whole workshop is to last two hours.  I want to do exercises that focus
in some way on what I had them read last time.  The authors were Kenneth
Patchen, James Tate, Clark Coolidge, Robert Lowell, Randall Jarrell, Allen
Ginsberg [Kaddish, for thematic reasons], Lisa Lewis [because she write a
poem about a friend on medication]) and if I had had time I would have added
Janet Frame, John Berryman, Delmore Schwartz...

I can always use old standards like giving out three words and getting
people to write poems about or using them, or going around in a circle
adding lines to a collective poem, but it would be fun to do something
different.  (On the other hand, if these people haven't done the standard
exercises, then they won't see them as old standards...)  It's totally off
topic from what I did last time, but I think it might be fun to write a
collective villanelle, where we work together on the two repeating lines and
then each person supplies the lines that chnage.

Interverse: Directions in Contemporary Poetry and Poetics
March 15 and 20, 2002 (NOTE date change for second session)
Berkeley Center for Writers
2275 Virginia Street, Berkeley

This conference is being organized by C21 Poetics, the 21st Century Poetics
working group at the Townsend Center for the Humanities, in conjunction wit=
h
their ongoing reading and discussion series. Interverse aims to pursue the
conjunction of theoretical poetics work and the practice of writing poetry
as a necessity, thus arguing against the division of labor currently
prevalent in the American field. The goal is to present actual conjunctions
of such work, including both individuals who practice each pursuit and
moments of collaboration between participants. Each participant has done or
is actively engaged with such collaborative work -- not just between poetry
and poetics, or between practitioners, but also between genres, media, and
disciplines. The hope is that this conference will lead to a larger-scale
on-site collaboration, with an added goal of promoting an enduring,
collaborative poetry/poetics community in the Bay Area.

Session One: Friday, March 15, 2002
6:30 pm potluck, 8 pm reading
Juliana Spahr, co-editor of Chain and author of Fuck You-Aloha-I Love You,
Response, and Everybody=B9s Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective
Identity, and Lytle Shaw, editor of Shark and author of Cable Factory 20 an=

The Lobe, will read from their work and discuss site specificity and Hawaii
as a particular (gendered, colonial, anti-colonial) site.

Session Two: Wednesday, March 20, 2002
6:30 pm potluck, 8 pm reading
Jennifer Moxley, editor of The Impercipient Lecture Series and author of
Imagination Verses, Wrong Life, Impervious To Starlight, and The Sense
Record, and Steve Evans, editor of The Impercipient Lecture Series, author
of The Dynamics of Literary Change, and creator of the online series Notes
To Poetry, will read from their work and discuss directions in contemporary
verse experimentalism.

Conference sessions are open to all interested parties; guests are asked to
arrive on time, bring food or drink, and help clean up afterwards if
possible.  Conference coordinators are Jennifer Scappettone of C21 Poetics

tho i guess one would have to be assuming that all mfa students did not grow
up the children of carpenters or steel workers...

i happen to be in the mfa program at brown...happen also to be the son of a
former ship-builder, now construction worker...grown up at the edge of a
barrio, less than two miles from tijuana...did the gang thing for a
while...did the graffiti thing as well...

tho i guess "it's not where you're from, but where you're at" (pulling out
my obscure quote book from mid-80's rap music)

this is extremely amusing...and except maybe for the sardonic list of
substance-abusers at the end,  i think it's very accurate; ...i have
sometimes made a similar point in conversation,  tho never so
articulately,,....


poetry (in a way that *stands out* from many other art activities,
ones which draw a greater degree of institutional/financial support
in our economy)  is defined by extreme economic marginality...  this
has more to do with what and how we do what we do,  and how we
interact,  than many think..  i find these points in some ways more
interesting than our more orthodox,  jargony attempts to locate poets
within a class analysis stricto sensu..

mark


"The point I am making is that for whom the poem is being writing is
crucial
in determining the form and content (indirectly the class) of the
poem. And,
since for most poets a poem has no economic viability, a poem is not a
product, writing it not a production; but a consumption. A poet very
often
must steal time (from productive economic activity, like addicts do)
to write
his or her poetry. Writing poetry subverts labor, is an
anti-productive
activity. It is done mainly for the experience, the thrill of writing
it,
compulsively, against labor. If so, a poem is a process, not a
product, not a
craft; an impulse to start constantly from scratch, to reinvent the
wheel.
This is very liberating but also surrounded with doom, a subversion of
economic value systems. In my view, this is the class status of the
poet in
the United States: a compulsive consumer, "working" against economic
reason,
like the gin drinkers in England during the industrial revolutions or
alcoholics or cocaine addicts."

Mark,

As I back-channeled you, the Buffalo Poetics List
meltdown of this past summer had disastrous
consequences, nationally, in the distrust and unease I
believe you're correct in diagnosing.

But, maybe more significantly, that feverish pitch
that things had broken past then coicided with

9/11,

and a whole other level of paranoias and battle
fatigue compounded all the poet-inflicted wounds.

. . . Which brings us to the more serious and
forboding omission on-List and in our poetries right
now:

the failure of our movements' modes not only to
incorporate incumbent issues of concern such as class
anxieties --- a bit of a red herring at the moment ---
but the more critical pressures that being at war and
recession and anthrax insanity, etc., exerts on us.

"Poets are the antennae of the race,"--- in which case
at least the heated prose letter-writing dialogue
on-List betrays the massive avoidance that the
collective psyche is exerting, a virtually schizoid
shut-down denial and foreclosure of the most obvious
challenge poetry is now facing: war, and whether our
mode is elastic enough to in any way confront these
devastations.

The "denial" is glaring.

The burden on poets and artists is doubly difficult,
because we feel in some way that our poetry is
~supposed to~ be the channel or voice for the
collective consciousness' current damaged
vulnerability--- and yet poetic "affect" (emotion) is
treated as an embarassing archaicism that's been
mocked on this List.

More humiliating, too, that poetries which our
sophistication (indoctrination, education) considers
too risibly unmentionable, such as the "hackneyed,"
"trite" poem that the 14 year old and 6 year old sons
of the Twin Towers casualty read this morning at the
six month memorial at "Ground Zero," ~are~ succeeding
in consummating the national focus.

We're going through something that for us as protected
innocents is as rupturing or worse than what our
parents and grandparents went through with the two
World Wars,--- and that battle fatigue produced
Modernism: see Surrealism hatching out of Breton's
transcriptions of the doughboys' nerve gas delirium,
see Beckett's buffo quadruplegics in baskets and
couples in garbage cans as living memory (objective
correlative) of the war-amputated, Existentialism, and
on and on.  The war poetries of the twentieth century
have always been completely opaque and shut off to
us/me: Paul Eluard, the artilleries glimpsed passingly
in Reverdy's cubism, . . . Tellingly, under now
discussion now, not the Whitman poet of the
battlefield but a Whitman re-written and neutralized
into a question of grammar, too.

A week or two after 9/11 I was in a NYC basement bar
reading, and, of the two readers, one of the List's
and community's more illustrious young mavericks was
reading punning, play-on-word, asyntactical "approved'
poetry, and the other, a more mature and seasoned
woman poet, was reading still post-modern but more
body-based, aggrieved semi-discursivity, which a poet
whispered to me was based on her experience with her
child suffering from cancer,--- and the first, School
of Buffalo poet sounded unbearably in bad taste,
beyond irrelevant, irresponsible, and the latter the
grounding of "affect" and hurtable flesh that was so
deeply needed.

It may take decades for poetry and art to work these
repressed traumas out into some form.  The predominant
obscurantist mode we've inheritted since the '80s does
not seem capable of meeting the challenge of so Grand
and intolerable a Theme.

I just thought your brave candor worth underscoring by
pointing out the invisible elephant in the middle of
the living room that the dysfunctional family isn't
talking about and ~can't~ talk about because our
poetic language has had "content" qua content censored
out of it.

This is what's called a "crisis" of representation (or
representability).

Personally, I'm looking backwards, to how the
Modernist generations worked out these dilemmas of
disjunctiveness and body bags.

Thanks, Mark.

Jeffrey

Yes, the passion of the most vocal on this list is politics, not art.
The expression "working-class poet" itself forms a picture of
"working-class" (and its various accretions and connotations) driving the
vehicle, while "poet(ry)" is consigned to the back seat (if not bound and
gagged in the trunk.)

   i've been following this sporadically...but a couple of points...the reason Poetics talk is such a bore is that it's a 'mystery' and better left there...to be tip toed around...and 'poetics' is such an awful word that it should be stamped out...

   as someone who has worked for 30 years as a 'street peddler'...not one  of your more prestigious jobs...but someone who is not particularly poor...i;ve had children to support...and contrary to the general sway... of this list..i'm not that much of an idiot...these issues always boil down to class...not money..

    also as someone who works for himself...and does not hire others...the 'petit bourgeous'....yes the very beast...i like most members of my class 'hate' above all the smug 'acadamecian...civil servant...bureaucrat'....the left that talks but does not work...and talks out of the left side of its mouth to protect its fat a..& mind..

    the academic destruction of Po is pretty much complete... what we have is theory and recapitualtion...the basis of po is feeling not lang...the cushioning of the U. & fear factor have nuked PO  out..from Naropa to Buffalo to the Ivy Leagues..it's all null and void...

     my dad started working as an apprentice tailor in Paris in the 30's....he was 13 & slept under the bridges of the Seine...he's still tailoring at 80...retired to a 50 hour a week work week..after a mjor heart attack...

     working is work...labor...it's not a theory...the sweat there of..and the sun at break of day...drn...

Dear :


The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of=
:

Transpacific Displacement: Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel=
 in Twentieth-Century American Literature

by Yunte Huang, Assistant Professor of English and American Literature and=
 Language at Harvard University, author of <I>Shi: A Radical Reading of=
 Chinese Poetry </I>and the translator into Chinese of Ezra Pound's <I>Canto=
s.</I>

"Yunte Huang has produced a fascinating study of what he calls 'textual=
 travelling,' which is to say, the transformation of poetic texts (in this=
 case Chinese ones) at the hands of American scholars, editors, translators,=
 and especially poets=8A. This brave and highly original study is sure to=
 raise controversy."-Marjorie Perloff, author of <I>Wittgenstein's Ladder</I=
>

Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less=
 well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific=
 displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's=
 imaging of Asia.  Authors covered include Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, and=
 Maxine Hong Kingston.

The Big Picture at Beyond Baroque - April 7th - Sunday

The website for this is done and is now up at:

http://beyondbaroque.org/bigpicture/index.html

and has more details about this event.  There is a good essay by Bill Mohr
in the ABOUT section about the history of SoCal poetry.

If you are a Southern California-based poet that has a book, a chapbook or
some published material, I hope you can come to this, participate,  and can
contribute your work.

We are going to have a professional group photo taken of SoCal poets.  It
will also be a drive for collecting work for the Beyond Baroque Archive,
and it will be a pot luck!  and it will also be an art opening -- all
wraped into one fun afternoon!

Please help get the word out!

WHAT:
Beyond Baroque Hosts
THE BIG PICTURE: A Convocation Of Southern California Poets

WHEN:
Sunday, April 7th, 2002 at 2:00 p.m.

WHERE:
BEYOND BAROQUE LITERARY ARTS CENTER
681 Venice Blvd.,
Venice, CA
(310) 822-3006

ADMISSION:
Free of charge!

On Sunday, April 7th, 2002, at 3:00 p.m., Beyond Baroque will host The Big
Picture, a convocation of published Southern California poets to be
photographed for National Poetry Month.

Southern California is a region of diverse populations, each with a unique
voice. For this event, we are bringing all these voices together--the
voices of our literary poets, our performance poets, our beat poets,
avant-garde poets, academic poets, hip-hop poets, environmental poets,
political poets, cowboy poets, and others. Often regions are not aware of
their cultural heritage. This is our change to preserve these poets for
posterity.

The event will take place at Beyond Barque, the non-profit foundation that
is the literary heart of Los Angeles. Founded in 1968 in a storefront in
Venice, the center has been the site of readings from such literary giants
and local icons as Allen Ginsberg, Philip Levine, David St. John, Kate
Braverman, Lewis MacAdams, Bob Flanagan, Charles Bukowski, Wanda Coleman,
Dennis Cooper, and many more. Many of SoCal's most beloved poets have been
alumnae of Beyond Baroque's longstanding workshops.

The event is being documented by Mark Savage, who is completed a five-year
project individually photographing the poets of Los Angeles. Called one of
the "finest up-and-coming portrait photographers in North America" by
American Photography, Savage's work has appeared in the Los Angeles Times,
MONEY, Fortune, and other publications. After the group photo, all poets
will be invited to visit his project, "Souls and Passions," on display at
the Beyond Baroque gallery.

In addition, participating poets will be donating copies of their
publications to the Beyond Baroque Archive, the largest independent
collection of Southern California poetry and ephemera on the West Coast.

the problem with a 'working class' anthology is that the poetry would likely
be drived from media stereotypes as that's what learned is of value.  I just
did some time at the county work center and we fought over whther to watch
WWF or Jerry Springer!

To join obliquely in the debate on this re holocausts and apocolyptics and
things - the point must be made that Allen (or part of Allen eg maybe  his
"subconscious") feels this way as we all do somewhat sometimes: eg even more
so the day after the night before! But 1) Alan's (your work Alan?)  work is
part of a larger enterprise of a complex project that seems to include this
sort of "raw stuff" with "technical" sections and so on and repetition is an
obvious and often a good device.  But looking at the recent posts from Alan
there seems to be more of an almost neo-romantic-confessionalist despair
(were the Cons ever really indespair: probably but...)  I was just thinking:
sure the world is "in peril" so to speak but then so far as we know that is
always the case. We are all "inperil"every minute (especially in Auckland
traffic its crazy over here)... In a sense we are all dying: so a more valid
response might be to say this in MY struggle: turn Hitler on his head: a
positive reaction...the acceptance that life is a struggle. Not passive
acceptance of suffering though. That said, I know how some people can and or
are thinking (often very negatively) re the international and national and
all the way to their personal situations. But apart from our existential lot
and the option of stoicism versus the pessimistic views (of which I have
been a dabbler somewaht myself at times) and the chance of everything
blowing to fuck and the torment and the human puniness sub specie
aeternitatis ... on bright days there are still flowers and hamburgers and
young men and women and children and song and light and sunsets and so on
without getting too carried away .. we cant have that!  Juat another take...
I dont think our century is any better than any other but probably its no
worse than any previous (although we do "boast" some pretty horrible wars
and other events): sure Israel-Palestine and we havent run out of wars but
there are still a lot of people living well (despite the suffering as well)
and so on.
    As well as that I'm to be a grandfather in about a month: so should I
encourage this sort of thing?! But seriously, I'm looking foreward to that
and have hope by and large (God (or X) forfend I become a "humanist" per se
however) to an exciting human future.  Some thoughts on the question...
Richard.

Otis Graduate Writers Program joins the Germ & Poetic Research Bureau =
in
welcoming

Jacques Roubaud and Stephen Rodefer

to Dawsons Book Shop, Friday at 7:30 pm!

Hell, those of you busy pups that missed Ange and Sarah last Sunday =
missed
plenty indeed, but anyone who'd pass on Friday is clearly clucked and
picking feathers from a molted rump...and you remember what happens to
finches when Alain Delon leaves the room! ZAP!=20

Well we've left Alain dodging les flics in the metro and brought the
Parisians home to you, lazy susans. Samoura=EFs indeed, but more =
Villons than
villains, these. Master swingers, there are none quicker: Rodefer and
Roubaud zip from pun to punch, from paradox to elegy in a Newfoundland
nanosec. They put the pottymouth in polymath and sell Polly for a song,
which is the sweetest exchange expected for a piebald mime in the small
bright lobby of the world. These are at least two of that world's =
brilliant
corners. Bring yours along and we'll call it Ours, a gallant collectiv
pooh-pooh to Tommy Ridge's Code Yellow. Hey, I am curious too, ain't =
you?

Oulipo Rex and Ubu Raw brought to you by Otis Grad Writers, merci!

Jacques Roubaud is a French poet and mathematician born in 1932. After
teaching Mathematics at the University of Paris X Nanterre beginning in
1970, Roubaud started publishing numerous books of poetry and prose. He =
has
published in all genres: prose, theater and poetry. He is one of the =
most
accomplished members of Oulipo, the workshop for experimental =
literature. He
is also the president of the Association Georges Perec. He has =
translated
Lewis Caroll's Hunting of the Snark and contemporary American poetry =
into
French. Most of his translated works are published by Dalkey Archive,
including The Plurality of Worlds of Lewis, Hortense in Exile, Hortense =
is
Abducted, Some Thing Black and The Great Fire of London.
Stephen Rodefer is the author of several collections of poetry, =
including
Mon Canard (2000), Left Under a Cloud (1999), Answer to Doctor Agathon
(1995), Erasers (1994), Leaving (1992), Emergency Measures (1987), and =
Four
Lectures (1977). Rodefer recently returned to the United States =
following
three years teaching in Paris and two at Cambridge. He continues to =
split
time between NYC and Paris. A former student of Charles Olson, he is =
sans
doute the most musical of those writers associated with the LANGUAGE =
School.
He has taught at San Francisco State University, University of New
Mexico-Albuquerque, and others.

Benjamin Hollander was born in Israel and emigrated to New York City in
1958, at the age of six. He has lived in San Francisco since 1978. His books
include The Book Of Who Are Was (Sun & Moon, 1997), How to Read, too (Leech
Books, 1992), and Translating Tradition: Paul Celan in France (editor, ACTS,
1988). Hollander's poetry and prose have appeared in a variety of journals,
including Sulfur, Sagetrieb, Hambone, Five Fingers Review, Boxkite, and
Raddle Moon. In 1993, he visited the Fondation Royaumont in Paris, where
selections of his poetry were collectively translated into French and
appeared as Le Livre De Qui Sont Etait (Creaphis, 1997). His work has also
been published in translation in several anthologies of French poetry,
including Tout Le Mond Se Ressemble: Une Anthologie de Poesie Contemporaine,
edited by Emmanuel Hocquard. Hollander served as an associate editor of
David Levi Strauss' Acts: A Journal of New Writing throughout the 1980's. In
the past, he has  directed The Floating Center for Poetry and Translation, a
forum for writers, translators and scholars engaging in collective
translations of contemporary foreign poets. He currently teaches critical
thinking, writing, and other courses at Chabot Community College in Hayward,
California.

Gwyneth Scally was born and raised in Washington, D.C. Her work is deeply
informed by early immersion in the worlds of politics and journalism; the
malleable natures of truth and information are important themes in her
paintings, as are the underlying psychological forces that shape the public
worlds of mass culture and social systems.  After receiving degrees in both
art and literature, Scally moved to Arizona. She paints in the Historic
Warehouse District of Tucson, interspersing her work with trips to Latin
America, Europe, and New York. Scally notes that the Southwest offers a pace
of life crucial to the creative process, as well as a grand physical expanse
of land and sky that challenges the artist to match its scale in vision.

POG events are sponsored in part by grants from the Tucson/Pima Arts
Council, the Arizona Commission on the Arts, and the National Endowment for
the Humanities.  POG also benefits from the continuing support of The
University of Arizona Poetry Center, the Arizona Quarterly, Chax Press, and
The University of Arizona Department of English .  We also thank the
following POG donors: Patrons Austin Publicover and Mark & Gail Seldess;

It does seem to come down to this:

What works works, what doesn't doesn't. And what works now is the elegiac,
with its range of rage for emptiness(s), for all those blank faces at the
edge of the void.

There always those who attack "academic" institutions: look I'm 54 in New
Zealand...I wish that I had gone to Columbia University (like Zukofsky) and
done the "traditional" courses and I especially (if I ever got the cash
would spend it - not on a trip to Africa or "lovely places"  well  like
parts of my own country (such as Queenstown were the FBI just had conference
(it was probably a week of heavy boozing and interfucking)): I'd sign up and
"do a David Denby  - who wrote about his experience on the "great Books"
course ok I'd be there the same as him but I'd love to get the grounding in
all those works and I'd go on to as many aspects of lit (trying to avoid
some of the ground I'd covered in Auck Uni during the 90s) eg I have really
studied Olson or Pound or Zukofsky but there are many other writers
throughought the world (including non-Western or "obscure" places): or even
there are huge areas of even European lit that is unknown to me....and so
on: but I would also have loved to have been in an MFA program: there is no
reason a student in one of those courses has to "swallow everything" (the
ones that moan about Art schools and the trammelling of their minds one
often suspects simply were or are too lazy: after all I doubt anywhere
nowadays wants people to "conform"...or if they do (I agree many
might -contradiction I know - then the student can use the course as a
"leaping off" place  - and I dont mean down! I mean - hope fully  - up!) But
not every one is going to be "great"  and so on .. I'd also have loved to
have been to the Naropa or The Black Mountain .... I think even now I'd
choose something like that: I  (at my age I'm more confident than I was as a
19, 20 year old ...I was very quiet then, used to not speak to people almost
at all....) would nowdays argue the toss - or quietly make my own way after
the course or both: I dont thnk accos mind some disagreement ..its a sign of
real interest and enthusiasm:  HOWEVER  its also true that someone who has
or will never attend Columbia or Oxford or any University and drives a truck
or whatever could be our next Shakespeare...or whatever.  So that's my take:
the MFA would do no harm...for some people it would be "the making of them"
as they say...and so on: that's my "take" on things for now.

  By the way: as there are so many poetry reading announcements: I'll make a
proleptic announcement:  Richard Taylor would have givegave a poetry
reading/performance (sans chairs) yesterday and it (would have or did) go
very well especially for his devotees who are numerous..interestingly
though, in view of the above, but not in bitter bitternessy, none of them
are academics as far as I know,...well....but it wouldwas at the "Departure
Lounge" on K'Road, Auckland,New Zealand (not far from Neville's record shop
and by the Vallencia)...that's proleptical. In the performance his/he would
have read The Red and it did or had went very wondrous strange...

Richard.

Not neccessarily. The class  thing "hits a nerve": humans (hence poets of
course) are  fascinated by their origions, history and future.  It is
impossile to extricate (most cases) politics from poetics. Discussion of
class is good: any discussion is good. It doesnt mean people dont like or
"love" poetry: you have no evidence for that. Anycase poets are (or I feel
"should") be curious about everything. especially these days when your
country is run by homicidal nutcakes planning more nuclear usage... But I am
interested in art and I love poetry and see where (in certain respects) it
is (or seems at times to be "most" distanced from "worldy" things...at one
stage I wanted to ignore politics and so on but it keeps creeping up behind
me and bashing me on my metaphorical head (like the chair that threatened Mr
C Bernstein the other day))...I also have faith that MOST people in the US
and everywhere else in the world are good.... Regards, Richard

You mean that of the working class they are near the bottom of the heap: or
on the "lowest" strata: and that is a reality but in the West we can be
"really working class" and relatively prosperous.  But I know what you're
saying: we should think of these people who are working in  (often) terrible
conditions: these people re the peole most often "terrorised" either by
physical threats or attacks or by the threat of being sacked. Those kind of
people can become suicide bombers: and one can understad how that comes
about: the "poor" Israelis exist but far more Palestinians are poor (I'm
aware that some also prosperous) and very often desperate - backs to the
wall - unlike many Israelis (there has never been an Israeli suicide
bomber) - they are often close to physical and psychological dspair -
desparation...even exhaustion through poverty and so on: their "frame of
mind" is often "revolutionary".  Richard.

Jerrold writes:
"tho i guess "it's not where you're from, but where you're at" (pulling out
my obscure quote book from mid-80's rap music)

But it's far more complex than that. Class background (what your parents and
their parents did), class position (what you do for a living yourself),
class stance (how you envision yourself, class-wise) and class direction
(where you are headed) all come into active play.

It was Sartre who noted that that artists are for the most part downwardly
mobile people (all those trust-fund kiddies that people have mentioned are
choosing to live differently from their parents, and genteel poverty is
poverty nonetheless).

I think of all the petit-bourgeois store and restaurant owners, who do have
the ability to hire and fire, but who often earn less the local mailman
after working 70+ hours every week. To confuse those people with  $150K
networking consultants or junior accountants at Andersen who plan to make
partner (or planned to, anyway, before Andersen blew up in its own
corruptness) and who think of W as being too far to the left is to yield a
pretty incoherent picture.

Add in the nation thing (not to mention the urban/rural axis, the role of
language or of religion) and you have a system with so many variables that
trying to generalize out of it just is silly.

For one thing, we need a definition of class that is adequate to the world
of the 20th century, rather than shoehorning everything into 19th C models
that weren't that accurate even then,

Stroffolino song
for Joanna

I know a boy named Stroffolino
He’ll talk to you ’til his face is blue
I know a boy named Stroffolino
Sometimes he’ll just talk right over you

Phil Ochs? Let me tell you about Phil Ochs, says Chris.

Here’s the whole Phil Ochs catalog
I have it on digital and analog
Here’s the Phil Ochs biography
Let me recite it to you from memory

I  am gonna sing all of his songs
I am gonna sing all night long
I don’t need any caffeine
I’m Chris Stroffolino, know what I mean?

Talk to me and tell me a story
About the time you met Povich Maury
About the time that you two guys hung
With him and his wife Connie Chung

I just wanna be like Stroffolino
Say whatever’s on my mind
I just wanna be like Stroffolino
Write great poems all of the time

At a Philadelphia reading
Chris decides that poetry’s dead
At a Philadelphia reading
Chris thinks Lenny Bruce is in his head

Stroffolino’s the best poet I know
A bit intense, even he’ll tell you so
He played keyboards with the Silver Jews
But it didn’t make the evening news
(and he’s not happy)

I am playing on a swing
Stroffolino’s swinging too
I am looking up at the sky
Pushing myself up real high
And Stroffolino won’t stop talking
(shh-h-h-h-h)

Talk to me and tell me a story
About the time you met Povich Maury
About the time that you two guys hung
With him and his wife Connie Chung

I just wanna be like Stroffolino
Say whatever’s on my mind
I just wanna be like Stroffolino
Write great poems all of the time

I am forwarding this message for Eileen Gregory
Cassandra Laity

CFP: MSA 4(Oct. 31 - Nov. 3) Poetry Panel on The Status of the Lyric

The category of "lyric" (lyricality, lyricism) has had a negative valence i=
n criticism for the last two decades, identified broadly with New Critici=
sm and with the Romantic and Modern suppositions which grounded it. "Lyri=
c" in recent criticism has implied nostalgia for presence, bourgeois deni=
al of historical contingency. Lyric is posited in an abstract, dialectica=
l opposition to narrative, the former carrying decidedly negative ethical=
 valences, the latter positive ones.=20

But reconsiderations of the lyric and lyricism is underway, which qualify o=
r go beyond the terms of its critical dismissal (Zimmerman on Romantic po=
etry, New on American poetry; Allen Grossman's Summa Lyrica and other com=
mentaries by practicing poets). I invite proposals that address the criti=
cal status of lyric (lyricality, lyricism) at the present moment. These m=
ay interrogate the critical history of discussions of lyric, consider som=
e of the current models of reading, or propose new models of investigatio=
n

Please send brief proposals to Eileen Gregory by  April 10, at engregory@ea=

consistently and successfully protected his work from
the defilement of publication.

THE MONSTER

If only to be rid of my persistent queasiness, I
determined a course of action. I would describe the
monster in all its repugnant detail. Yes: exactly!

No! I'll not lie any longer! Doesn't the storm still
rage outside my window? Don't lovers still hide in the
closet, preserving their mysteries from one another?
Nevertheless, I've thought deeply in my kingdom,
favoring the international perspective. Despite the
rheumatism, I’m a respected conversationalist.

Like a shaft of bioluminescent lightning, the
vituperative truth struck me in an instant: I was not
in fact a lighthearted being.

What difference if the monster has or hasn't performed
this or that act to this or that part of my body or
ideas? Pieces of my "nevertheless" still exist in its
teeth. Even now, I recoil from a knitted hat as if it
were a second colony.

O, this accursed urge to make friends with it! My god!
Its footsteps! The scene is playing again, through the
gothic doorarch—fringed entirely in shadows!

Am I deceived? Does it not pause by the mirror,
encased in so-called visible reality, to admire
itself? Does it not yet know it’s a monster?

I beg you—defenseless, sickly, just over here a little
ways

O, the fog on the moat! O, the moat under the fog!
Will I ever be indifferent? Will I know love?

Regardless--I've lived! Goodbye, glinting fixtures!
Goodbye, stanchions of oak! After me, the flood!

Hysterical Materialism

The booming flowers are an affect of local politics
Just as the bed sheets are torn to assure us peace
Thusly we misidentify ourselves as a cannon
And a gaffe is made to turn its back
Like the sky flung across the neck of a welcoming nude

Each cylinder, orchid, thread, furnace
Has time and thought at its most real
For as the screaming quiets the neighborhood
The melon is cut.

In normal circumstances I am a quiet, unobtrusive little man who would never
ever boast any qualities or significance but in confernence and urgent
consideration of the comment below - which elevates literary criticism to
such heights: well we now have a new category of poetry or poetics:
Philosadrivel..now in this category people will be able to attempt to outdo
each other in inanity or pointlessness and compete also in divagatious
"frittles" of fragments: prizes such as Poet Lauriate to he/she who
drivellest longest ad so on.....hence I had to send this on with C Stroffo's
commendations with which I am (modestly) in agreement. Richard.

To the best of my recollection it's in the blurb on the back of the Talisman
_Younger (American) Poets_ anthology.  (I should add that if you want an
interesting & extremely hostile reading of that blurb & of the book as a
whole, it's worth looking at Andrea Brady's review in _Quid_ magazine 4.)

Dear List--I just wanted to draw your attention to one of the most
remarkable sound poets I've ever heard.  Hebriana Alainentalo was born in
Liviojarvi, Lapland, in the far north of Sweden, bordering Finland.  In her
sound work she seeks to replicate the sounds of the georgaphical area in
which she lives.  Truly remarkable Shaman-like vocalizations of great range
and power.  Some of what she does reminds me a bit of Meridith Monk's

I see what you mean---

the poetry we respect the most, at leasdt on this list, is content-free even
when it has content.  For example, a language poem may have a whole little
section that reads like a piece of free verse of the sort we abhor, and it
may even have characters in it, with, dare to mention it... emotions... but
we aren't to read it as a poemlet with any affective content.  Instead we
are to read the junctures between the sections and glory in the fact that
the poem as a whole does not do anything so vulgar as narrate or lyricize or
god forbid promote an idea or make us feel anything.

What's obvious, of course, is that the skills needed to write such a poem
are exactly those needed to write the poemlets, eg the tradutional ones of
observing the world around us and forming images about it and so on.  So
that anyone can become a language poet if their poems are short enough and
they combine them into a single poem with each one having different margins.

By the way, I am thinking of language poems I quite like when I say this (I
had N/O or Ron Silliman's in front of me, which does do what I am describing
but also uses many other techniques and does noit reduce to the method I
suggested above), and of course I am exaggerating.

Then of course there are language poems which are composed only of
recognizable words or phrases but no little sections.  Lest anyone say "my
two-year-old could do that with the aid of a really good dictionary," I'd
like to point out that these poems can be hilarious when done right
(although the joke does get old when a whoile book is like this, as in
Jackson Mac Low's _Twenties_) and surely would be painful if done wrong.  I
heard Bruce Andrews read a poem like this on New years at the Poetry Project
and it was pretty cool.  But it is the ultimate banishment of content.

Why has it become vulgar to write a poem about something unless it is an
angry poem about how you were raped when you were twelve by your father's
gay lover?  If the story is sensational enough, it seems, we are willing to
call it poetry even if it is badly written, whereas being about something
tends to eliminate much decent poetry from being thought of as any good if
it is about less soap-operatic content.

I shouldn't talk as if this is something They do to me or something, because
when I'm at the bookstore looking at new poetry books, and I flip them open
one by one, I immediately discard anything in which the language is just
standard written English arranged in free verse and there is a discernable
subject.  If I can't tell what the poem is saying, that means I'm more
likely to buy the book, esopecially if I suspect it isn't saying anything at
all.  So I am a slave to this fashion of sneering at content.

Mark,

As I back-channeled you, the Buffalo Poetics List
meltdown of this past summer had disastrous
consequences, nationally, in the distrust and unease I
believe you're correct in diagnosing.

But, maybe more significantly, that feverish pitch
that things had broken past then coicided with

9/11,

and a whole other level of paranoias and battle
fatigue compounded all the poet-inflicted wounds.

. . . Which brings us to the more serious and
forboding omission on-List and in our poetries right
now:

the failure of our movements' modes not only to
incorporate incumbent issues of concern such as class
anxieties --- a bit of a red herring at the moment ---
but the more critical pressures that being at war and
recession and anthrax insanity, etc., exerts on us.

"Poets are the antennae of the race,"--- in which case
at least the heated prose letter-writing dialogue
on-List betrays the massive avoidance that the
collective psyche is exerting, a virtually schizoid
shut-down denial and foreclosure of the most obvious
challenge poetry is now facing: war, and whether our
mode is elastic enough to in any way confront these
devastations.

The "denial" is glaring.

The burden on poets and artists is doubly difficult,
because we feel in some way that our poetry is
~supposed to~ be the channel or voice for the
collective consciousness' current damaged
vulnerability--- and yet poetic "affect" (emotion) is
treated as an embarassing archaicism that's been
mocked on this List.

More humiliating, too, that poetries which our
sophistication (indoctrination, education) considers
too risibly unmentionable, such as the "hackneyed,"
"trite" poem that the 14 year old and 6 year old sons
of the Twin Towers casualty read this morning at the
six month memorial at "Ground Zero," ~are~ succeeding
in consummating the national focus.

We're going through something that for us as protected
innocents is as rupturing or worse than what our
parents and grandparents went through with the two
World Wars,--- and that battle fatigue produced
Modernism: see Surrealism hatching out of Breton's
transcriptions of the doughboys' nerve gas delirium,
see Beckett's buffo quadruplegics in baskets and
couples in garbage cans as living memory (objective
correlative) of the war-amputated, Existentialism, and
on and on.  The war poetries of the twentieth century
have always been completely opaque and shut off to
us/me: Paul Eluard, the artilleries glimpsed passingly
in Reverdy's cubism, . . . Tellingly, under now
discussion now, not the Whitman poet of the
battlefield but a Whitman re-written and neutralized
into a question of grammar, too.

A week or two after 9/11 I was in a NYC basement bar
reading, and, of the two readers, one of the List's
and community's more illustrious young mavericks was
reading punning, play-on-word, asyntactical "approved'
poetry, and the other, a more mature and seasoned
woman poet, was reading still post-modern but more
body-based, aggrieved semi-discursivity, which a poet
whispered to me was based on her experience with her
child suffering from cancer,--- and the first, School
of Buffalo poet sounded unbearably in bad taste,
beyond irrelevant, irresponsible, and the latter the
grounding of "affect" and hurtable flesh that was so
deeply needed.

It may take decades for poetry and art to work these
repressed traumas out into some form.  The predominant
obscurantist mode we've inheritted since the '80s does
not seem capable of meeting the challenge of so Grand
and intolerable a Theme.

I just thought your brave candor worth underscoring by
pointing out the invisible elephant in the middle of
the living room that the dysfunctional family isn't
talking about and ~can't~ talk about because our
poetic language has had "content" qua content censored
out of it.

This is what's called a "crisis" of representation (or
representability).

Personally, I'm looking backwards, to how the
Modernist generations worked out these dilemmas of
disjunctiveness and body bags.

Thanks, Mark.

Jeffrey

first, jeffrey j---i don't understand how a discussion of class is a
diversion from the real elephant (the war, and the foreboding public
sphere that thereby emerges)... i'm not sure you're saying this---but
if you are... there are at least several elephants in the room with
us, far as i can tell, have been right along... you wanna talk about
the war, as we have in the past, please jeffrey, let's talk about the
war!... if so disposed, i'll chime in (as i have been writing about
it in/for other contexts)...

ron, it seems to me that, aside from those who ascribe to more
unreconstructed versions of same, class has only ever been a
loosely-defined rubric under which certain kinds of
experiences/beliefs/loyalties are presumed to be held (and *are* held
perhaps most emphatically, if tacitly, at the local levels at which
they apply, i would say) as more pressing than others... which
awareness of same could yet provide the basis for more global
coalitions/alliances... which could yet be the basis for certain
kinds of (demographic and theoretical) generalizations...

locally in fact, one can (still) identify working-class communities
with very specific attributes, to whatever degree they might depart
from more typical postwar representations... take las vegas, for
example... it's become something of THE collective bargaining center
in the intermountain/southwestern u.s., as many of you no doubt know,
what with its casino workers---from housekeepers to
valets---unionized, and making what, by all accounts, is a decent
wage (so many of these workers are latino/a, i might add)... so it's
pretty easy to generalize about las vegas---what sort of housing is
available, e.g., on what sorts of salaries... and it's pretty easy to
see this class of workers as distinct from that upper class profile
you point to... as it's pretty easy to see the growing presence of
casinos on native american reservations as distinct from said
profile...

it's also pretty easy for me to point to friends/acquaintances whose
parents were from the working class, like mine, yet who aspire to
middle and upper-middle class trappings in ways that often strike
[me] as mere affectation... me too, i would say---i mean, i share
some of these affectations, and it bugs me, sometimes a lot,
sometimes a little (e.g., if you tell me that the 26" tv in the
middle of our living room is a mere affectation, you and i are going
to have words... b/c i have been known to regard the *absence of
same* on the part of my friends as an affectation)... yes, very muddy
waters to be sure, but no less susceptible for that to critical
reflection... as an academic, i'm struck that this is something of
the same problem richard rodriguez lineates in his ~hunger of memory~
(and i'm aware that even mentioning rodriguez's name gives some folks
conniptions---for the record, i'm not endorsing his assimilative
leanings)...

as to the question of the petit-bourgeois (if that isn't *already* an
anachronistic construction):  i'm not wedded to maintaining strict
class boundaries/loyalties, but e.g., your ma & pa restaurant
owners---more and more of whom, it seems to me, can be identified as
belonging to a dwindling, generally urban body of "non-white ethnic"
restaurateurs (thanx in the main to the proliferation both of fast
food joints and, more recently, syndicated "ethnic food" joints like
olive garden, which, despite their organ-grinding claims, continue
the assimilation e.g. of "italian" into "white" via superficially
"ethnic" food)---seems to me that these ma & pa restaurateurs are
aspiring, many of them, to some version of the old american dream...
that is, realistically or no, the same old same old american dream
that greeted the first and second waves of immigration into the u.s.
last century... that current economic realities would seem to give
the lie to this dream (would have given the lie to it to some degree
in past decades, if looked at aright) doesn't mean it's not alive and
well... personally, i don't think you work 70 hrs/week as a
restaurateur w/o something of this aspiration, but i could be wrong...

i say this to suggest that these restaurateurs are hardly the
european petit-bourgeois, say, as represented by the german, then
french-german, side of my mother's family pre-wwii, who owned a
restaurant, chez bentz (later, chez bourgoin), in landau,
germany---which restaurant, i hear tell, is now a sawmill, having
been grabbed up by the reich (uh-oh, there i go again, waxing
autobiographical)... my mother's parents obviously didn't predicate
their lives on anything like an "american dream"---though my father's
sicilian parents did, their version of the dream consisting, i would
say, of the possibility of home/land-ownership (which never
happened)...

but what to do with this information?... i would say, if one can
posit a restaurateur profile here, today, over and against one there,
yesterday, over and against that $150K financial manager profile you
mention, ron, you have some data that might be used to draw some
conclusions... so again, i guess i have to disagree with you when you
write:  "you have a system with so many variables that trying to
generalize out of it just is silly"... i just can't get behind this
kind of, uhm, generalization (!), no hard feelings... in fact, this
discussion seems at times to drift between the scylla of "nobody here
can talk about working class" and the charybdis of "nobody here
*should* talk about working class"...

gender and race are immensely difficult, messy social categories
(whether one holds that class is more difficult or messy is not quite
to the point)... that this doesn't stop folks from speaking about
them intelligently (as well as making patently absurd claims for
same) should mean that class, too, ought to enjoy such considered
treatment around here (and i refrain from discussing the
interrelatedness of gender/race/class---but of course, this serves to
make any such discussion the more daunting)...

and i would think, i would think that one of the very BEST ways to
get at these experiential conundrums, together, would be to seek out
the requisite messy articulations---i.e., WRITE ABOUT THEM... what
are we doing here together, anyway, if not trying to learn something
about what we've each learned?... and though some will say this
departs from a discussion of poetics per se, i will for the umpteenth
time observe that what one says, and how one says it, depends for its
reception at least in part on the who that is presumed to be saying
what, how... we needn't beat this into the ground constantly, no, but
what's wrong with a little discussion of our class anxieties?...
really, from where i sit, putting a human face on this stuff helps me
digest (i.e., w/o alka seltzer) those many sentences coming at me
online whose semantic immediacy depends largely on what the meaning
of "is" is...

in this regard:  aaron belz's query about a convention/conference or
some such emerging from and attending to this list community has been
raised before (by moi, if you've been around for a while)... for the
record, again, i think it's a great idea... but i can offer no
practical suggestions on this count, either...

anyway... i would mself prefer writing (on class etc.) that at least
occasionally takes stock of its own representational
assumptions/inadequacies... though autobiography can often amount to
little more than ejaculation of logos in solitude, i have to confess
that this kinda stuff only comes home to me, as a rule, if someone,
uhm, brings it on home...

best,

Yep. But you all have to fly out to Panmure (Auckland) (New Zealand) and its
to be held in my local boozer which is working class - well its full of
retired working stiffs - but is an historical pub: none of your goin' to the
Auckland Uni and reading there with likes of Leggott and that Wystan Curnow
or those brainy blokes and blokessses (the Departure Lounge on K Road has
living writers and poets etc and musicians every Tuesday night though) at
Auckland or any yuppy or any well-heeled people or those "arty" types with
funny hair people: a special will be a visit to Otara (Auckland's Harlem): a
riot (we had one last week) at the Auck Council meeting where the crazy
Mayor (John Banks) (who gets parking tickets and got a fine for riding a
kind of jet ski thing on a local beach and who wants to evict old pensioners
and build more motorways and deport all "foreignors"): you have to pay me to
come to the conference and stay in a local home of (preferably) a Samoan or
Maori family, put in a days work at a factory in Penrose (industrial area)
and go through Otahuhu to view the prostitutes and glue sniffers (one was
killed the opther week)  .. closer to home we have the RSA (just down the
road from where I write at this very now) you can get chea beer at the place
where three people were either gunned to death or bludgeoned and one
critically injured): and you might get a visit to various of our jails where
(because NZ has the highest per capita violent crime in the Western world
and also suicide rate) you might see the results of crime, violence, and
then there are the mental institutions (well, actually they've been
dismantled so a walk around the Central Business district would suffice...or
PERHAPS a visit to the Philosophy Department at A.U.) ...and I dont  mean
the universities: a stroll down K'Road is also on the menu: then a visit to
the big "pie cart" where (in truth) the hamburgers are quite good: this to
be followed by a rapid detour throught the art galleries, a three hour
poetry reading by myself then a dash back to the boozers and the strip joint
where there are women naked in water (a bit like the big glass thing in
Locus Solus...)...for women poets there are other diversions (that is male
strippers are probably available)...there's dancing at night clubs with
women and young (usually - I might have a go one day) who wear ..well they
are nearly naked: and take ecstasy....there are also a lot of tansvestites
gays etc around Ponsonby K Road...but only 1/7 or 1/17 of the total time at
the most can be spent at the Auckland or any other University and not too
much talking to "famous" New Zealand literarty people, or "hushed" readings,
and no visits to Queenstown (as I've never been there and believe its a
terrible place full of thousands of corrupt tourists and also
mosquito-ridden and the mountains are just like mountains in Canada
probably).... So that should be on in the near future. Regards, Richard. PS
Topic...anything will do, any drivel about literature or politics sex, pig
farming, or whatever...

Its in Mark Scroggin's book about paul Zukofsky which I just completed : a
great book: here it is:

    My heart rouses
              thinking to bring you news
                  of something
   that concerns you
              and concerns many men. Look at
                        what passes for the new.
  You will not find it there but in
             despised poems.
                       It is difficult
  to get the news from poems
            yet men die miserably evry day
                      for lack
  of what is found there.
 -Wilinas Carlos Wiliams  "Pictures from Brueghel"  162-62

  This is the heading or the quote that prefaces the final chapter  "A
Poemical Conclusion   (Toward)  A Poetry of Knowledge"   taht I tto k from
"Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge."

That is an interesting study of Zukofsky and his poetics versus Pound.
Stevens Williams and such as the Language poets and Ronald Johnson and also
John Taggart.

"what is found there" is what?  Maybe insights into compassion, truth
telling, being "reality": one would hope for example that poetry helps in
some way to "intensify life" ....  William's "die miserably" might be
compared to something I read years ago about Chess:  "To die without having
played Chess is [analagous to] dying without ever hearing music."  But then
maybe its  to die without "hearing" or "seeing" what is deep in words....
  Scroggins's point in this last chapter about poetry as a form of "telling"
or conveying "knowledge" indicates the "musical" (not stricly in the literal
sense of mimesis) but in the "fugal" form and structure and uses (in this
chapter) the example of "Mantis" which is in Sestina form...but there is a
commentary (by Zukofsky) which is in effect part of a single poem..Mantis
and The Commentary... and that, by drawing attention to the form and the
"act of making" moves the poem more greatly into the light so to speak.  But
I am probably not giving a very good picture of the book: its a very
extensive book and well written.
   In passing, I would be interested inothers of that series.  regards,
Richard.

Hey, Chris and Tim--

If it's possible to pull my post from yesterday, "WCW Query," can you
please do that?  Sorry to be a pain.  I've gotten it answered.  If not,
can you please post this follow-up:

Thanks for all responses to my WCW query.  I'd thought the passage in

bleary 1 a.m. eyes.

(It may be a sign of my own creeping conservatism, but
I personally feel uncomfortable with gratuitous
vilification of financial industry professionals.  As
if there were no James Sherry.  And now especially,
after the wholesale slaughter of them in the tens of
hundreds and the leveling force of the Grim Reaper's
scythe has painfully revealed them to be/to have been
little more than workers in their own right.  But
that's not my point here . . .)


Isn't all this discussion of class and class
obligations within poetry missing its propelling
factor, without any corollary sense of ~revolution~
and the poet-revolutionary?  Any attempted analysis of
class, even from a rightist consumer-exploitative
stance, has its basis and origin in, of course, Marx's
class theories.  And that Marxist, post-Marxist or
quasi-Marxist always took its motivating force aginst
class from variously manifested versions of
"revolution."

I have recently been reinvestigating Surrealism, . . .
which partly lost its saliency because the
"engagement" [pronounced "on-gozh-mon-t'"] of
Existentialist commitment segued better into the
concrete '68 revolutions, . . .  and its genuine,
troubled political dimension: Breton co-authored a
paper with Trotsky, many Surrealists "defected" from
the Surrealist Revolution into Communist Party
membership, etc.; so, it's much on mine my mind how,
where, and when both real collaboration with
"revolutionary" political movements and social forces
or a ~myth~ of revolution fuelled the XXth century
avant-garde we're the inheritors of.

The line forward from Surrealism and the October
Revolution is fairly easy to draw: Surrealism out of
the more short-lived, nihilistic and less articulated
Dada forward into Lettrism, Situationism, and perhaps
Lacan and post-structuralism.  But I find myself
faltering --- I need more research or education into
the pre-history of Modernism --- in trying to trail
the line backward chronologically.  The Modernist
precursors, the Impressionists in painting and Les
Symbolistes in poetry, although formally often
continuous with the Cubisms and -isms that flowed out
of or were spawned in reaction against them, on the
face of things do not exactly appear to be
~revolutionary~ in the same sense: rather, the Manet
depictions of men in waist coats and top hats as the
~celebration~ of haute bougeoisie, the Monet leisure,
etc., and, in poetry, end-of-an-era decadence rather
than a generative "revolution,"--- a decadence,
albeit, whose obscurantism remains larger the
prototype and starting point of Modernist and
post-modern obscurantisms, including the current
"asyntactical."

However, despite the occasional formal resemblances,
--- and I know that here and there there must indeed
have been counter examples of sympathies for the
emergent splinter group pre-October Socialists and
utopians that I just am uneducated about, such as (?)
the younger American Whitman or Hawthorne's and the
Transcendalists' Fourier communes --- these
precursors, again, rather than being anti-"capitalist"
seem to typify an ~epitome~ of capital, and their
aesthetic revolution to be on the plane of, say,
innovation in the fashion design of ~haute couture~
clothes, glass stemware (Lalique, Tiffany), and such.


The ~ultra-moderne~ rather than Modernist
"revolution."

For want of a better word, I'm thinking of that high
capitalist ~semblable~ of later anti-capitalist
avant-garde as "High Style."  (Maybe it's a
Mannerism.)  Regardless, it represents a legitimate
moment where formalist relatedness conceals political
antithesis, and demonstrates a Modernism that was
fully dedicated to capital, rather than class
revolution.


(And there was pre-Modernist or even anti-Modernist,
non avant-garde revolutionary art: the realist
classicism of Jean-Louis David's ~Tennis Court Oath,~
etc., which commemorated political upheavals and
~coups d'etat.~)


And, --- pessimistically? --- I wonder if we haven't
come full cycle and, fin-de-siecle again, at the
turning point of both centuries, whether our
particular historical branch --- "hippy" revolutionary
Beat > Black Mountain > Language --- hasn't had the
revolutionary myth effectively drain out of it, --- so
that our current uneasy condition is a ~vestigial~ lip
service to "revolution" but a reversion to High Style
"bourgeois"/middle class conservatism.   The
discrepancy between the lived careerism and MFA-ing of
poetry, the (first generation) New York School
buttoning up back into shocking neckties and blazers
versus the Beat dishevelment, (the journal ~Fence~?)
--- aren't we in a position like the earliest
Modernists, living "the good life," fully trafficking
in the pleasures of capital, and ~only~ observing a
superficial (hypocritical?) ~trace~
pseudo-revolutionariness in formal aesthetic
experimentalism (an experimentalism that has,
meanwhile, obviously become its own paradoxical
conservatisim of an "alternative tradition," perhaps
in fact the ~sole~ keepers of tradition)?

The point being that, without revolution, including a
revolutionary ideology for poetry (~Revolution dans la
Langue Poetique~?), class is merely class,--- and
discussion about its frictions is just moot, neither
here nor there: it's all missing its necessary
leverage ("revolution").

......................................................

Incidentally,---

(Any "revolutionary" agenda, of course, is currently
badly compromised or stifled, like the tepid street
protests against the recent World Economic Forum, by
revolution's indistinguishability from terrorism, or,
for that matter, berserk schizophrenic violence [the
newspaper-certified "schizophrenic" shooting up a post
office, and Baden Meinhof-ish shooting up a post
office], and the reasonable-seeming total clamp-down
of new social controls and revoked civil liberties.)


(. . . And something should later be said about "Drug
Culture," the most covert co-factor of revolutionary
avant-gardism.)  :)

digs in Paris ("Of all the most intensely American of poets, Rodefer is the
most European" --Rod Mengham).  Two large collections of new poetry
appeared during 2000, Mon Canard (The Figures) and Left Under a Cloud
(Alfred David Editions, UK)--each incorporating the long poem Erasers.  He
is author of over twenty books of poetry, prose, translations (notably the
best Villon in English), plays, essays, fiction.

"Stephen Rodefer and his writing are, as we say in French, a force of nature=
=2E"
--Pierre Alferi.

What person
                deserves
                        another's love?
What
                person
                        does not.
(from Erasers)


CHRIS STROFFOLINO's striking new collection of essays on contemporary poets
and poetry, Spin Cycle (Spuyten Duyvil) follows his book of poetry
Stealer's Wheel (Hard Press).  Recently moved to Oakland from New York City
(after Pennsylvania and Albany, NY), he teaches at St. Mary's College, in
Orinda, CA.

"Chris Stroffolino's poems are dizzying in their rapid fire statements and
metaphors. . . . Stroffolino is an original and he's brilliant." --James
Tate.

"Stroffolino harks back, his poems resonate with history, alive and
unending thanks to a Shakespearean Padovan Pennsylvanian mix phenomenal in
its lusty brilliance.  Tucked back into our bodies by his laughter, we're
at last ready to agree 'it's the mind now.' I don't think I'm 'too close to
the source to see the image'--to hail this poet as among the foremost of
the young who are already giving striking form to a generation's
perplexities."  --David Bromige

You can't avoid what you can't control.
Even if it's not a blackout,
A candle won't envy a lava lamp. . . .

I've read these well-written and interesting messages a number of
times, Jeffrey, (and Mark), and while I agree that you've specified
an important issue- namely the "problem" of representation for those
who practice non-representational art forms- the underlying
schadenfreude in the crocodile tears shed about this issue, for me,
abets the value in whatever points you are making. One of the things
I most enjoy about abstract art is that by avoiding concreteness and
literality it is sometimes able to avoid reflecting,and thereby
directly participating in and reproducing, the overshadowing
sadomasochism of this period and age. This,of course,does not stop
anyone from rediscovering and reproducing it by means of critical
response-since in this medium what you see- and what you don't see-
is what you get.

I thought I'd forward this for Trevor, who's not on this list at present.  I
was just talking to him on the phone & he tells me that Tom Raworth is
confirmed for the event. -- I was at the Cork festival in 1999 & can say
that it's a worthwhile & entertaining event--great city to visit, too (I
recall going up the bell tower in Shandon with cris cheek, Keith Tuma &
Karen Mac Cormack so cris could taperecord the bells ringing for use in his
performance later in the festival...). -- all best --N

(Apologies for cross-posting)

This is by way of preliminary notice to listees who might be
interested, that the Cork Poetry Festival will be held on Friday May
10th and Saturday May 11th next. We're still fixing up the list of this
year's participants, but it's probably not too difficult to construct
some sort of a picture from the names of some of those inveigled
into taking part in previous years.

We've had readings from Tony Baker, Ken Bolton, Ric Caddell, cris
cheek, Catherine Daly, Fergal Gaynor, Matthew Geden, Harry
Gilonis, John Goodby, Randolph Healy, Fanny Howe, Trevor Joyce,
Judy Kravis, Karen MacCormack, Billy Mills, Tom Raworth, Maurice
Scully, Robert Sheppard, Michael Smith, Geoffrey Squires and
Catherine Walsh, and papers from Alex Davis, Harry Gilonis, John
Goodby, Romana Huk, Trevor Joyce, Karen MacCormack, Jim
Mays, Billy Mills, Robert Sheppard, Keith Tuma.

(Apologies to anyone I've left out: brains addled)

So if you're going to be in this part of the world in early May, or
could be here with a little organization, what more enticement do
you need?

. . . . other than concrete details, which will be supplied as they
become available . . . .

For what it's worth, Jacques-Louis David was the avant-garde, recognized as
such at the time and by art historians since. For what he rebelled against,
think  Fragonard or Vigee-Lebrun.

And the impressionists (and post-impressionists), tho some were not only
haut bourgeois but pretty repulsive politically (Degas), were not just
revolutionaries in their art but laid the groundwork for future political
revolutionaries by eliminating the genre painting as genre (sorry, but
that's our language) by making the everyday, and it's the everyday of all
classes, almost the only subject for painting, to the virtual exclusion of
everything but landscapes, still-lifes and formal portraits. The revolution
was in the change of focus and practice, which to my mind is a lot more of
a political statement than painting as manifesto.

On July 26-27, 2002
there will be an Avant symposium
in Columbus Ohio

This is shaping up to be a major event - so far we also have
committments
to come from Sheila Murphy, Bob Grumman, Richard Kostelanetz, Jim
Leftwich, Thomas Taylor, Mike Basinski, David Baratier, John Byrum,
Scott Helmes, K. S. Ernst, Ivan Arguelles, Lewis LaCook, Ficus
strangulensis, and others, including 2 big collectors: Marvin Sackner
and Bob Jackson.

If you are interested in participating please e-mail me back
with the info needed,  as writ below by John M. Bennett,
curator of the A-G library:

let me know by April 19 the title of your presentation and a brief
description of what you're planning to do.  If it's "just" a
reading, say "reading".  Please let me know your technical requirements
also (slide projector, video, Flash, etc.)  At present, it looks like
30-minute blocks of time for each presentation may be possible, but that

could change.

The schedule is shaping up this way:  Fri. evening July 26 we'll have a
reception hosted by the Friends of the Libraries, and Marvin Sackner
will
give a keynote address.

Sat.  July 27 we'll have the presentations, round table, a tour of the
Rare
Book and Avant Writing Collections, and then dinner at an Italian
restaurant downtown.

We are planning a round-table discussion on collaboration; if you want
to
participate in that, please be prepared to make a short 3-minute
statement/rant/comment for openers.


Be well

I think she's a good poet, possibly not "great" if that term has relevance:
I wouldnt say "sucks" I think I "looked" at or "locked" onto her writing
because her name came up in critical discussions re John Ashbery (and
possibly Scott Hamilton mentined her some time back).  I think if we are
talking ability she has it but it is (sometimes) something like Merrill's
extreme cleverness: or the difficulty of her poetry is in the "argument" of
her poems which seem to be as complex as some of Auden's (earlier? I'm not
sure I havent read deeply enough of Auden...but his later poems are
excrutiatingly clever and sometimes more, but lack "depth" (not always))
while Jorie has some quite brilliant ideas and poems and sometimes evrything
seems to search toward a "great poem" ...but the other problem for me - if
its a problem - is that say versus some of the Language poets or some of the
post-post moderns or more improvisatory poets, her work looks tame.  This
doesnt invalidate it...just puts her in one of the many rooms of the
mansion: I mean I read Rita Dove but (I dont want to sound petulant or
arrogant or nasty) she or Maya Angelou I dont think will ever teach me much
(and maybe neither will Graham):  all the modernists including Pound WCW  L
Z and Stein and many others, back to Whitman and in England Browning and
Swinburne and Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Olson and Creeley (I was reading a
brilliant sequence of (semi-disjucntive pieces the other day) even Ammons
and John Ashbery, the Language poets, Prynne etal of the Grossetest, Iain
Sinclair (the dark) and Peter Reading, David Jones and even Geoffrey Hill
and off shoots or some more recent poets and poets many on this List and
others experimenting and testing etc but Angelou I cant (maybe I am not
"tuned  into her" and maybe that's the same for Dove)...Jorie Graham is a
more complex and "intellectual" poet (key word_ more_) but unlike Zukofsky
or a more recent poet as Ronald Johnson  (I only know what brief things I've
seen of him and  the discussion in Mark Scroggin's book on L.Z.) .... its
the problem of better or different but L Zukofsky (despite his intricacy and
opacity (or partly becuase of it)) one can read or "hear" the music ( a
higher language: a "true" poetry ) which is the same for all very
significant poets...but I'm not sure taht I want to unravel the complexities
of Jorie Graham: but in this I may be wrong..I used a line of hers in my
Infinite Poem  ...it was something like "the wall of the flesh opened
endlessly.." [possibly "the wall opened endlessly" is better -  for me I
hasten!] and I woudnt just wipe a poet who has the Pulitzer (worry as such
prizes are I know) ... (I know I "wiped" Rod McKuen before and that was a
bit inconsistent as he is not just a "poet on the page" he's a
singer-songster (or maybe that's a bit patronising)) .. its complex and
problematic this evaluation of poets: politics, philosophy, yes, even class,
gender and one's own personal responses (even moods) come into it: also it
might be premature: so many poets have been rubbished, although there have
also been many who are "centre-stage" who dont seem (as time passes) to have
contributed to the core of the poetic story...this is a quick response ...
we should give strong and long attention to all poets of whatever ilk (I
think Ron Silliman was right in warning -some time back - of being
dismissive of other poets - the point maybe to getting onto what "we" are
doing - whoever we are - but, we will always have our evaluations)...maybe
sometimes for ourselves to venture down a certain "road" we need to ignore
the possibility (for the while) of other, brighter, roads. That is _if_ they
are brighter: or ow do we know without a very attentive look?  I' just
sorting out my own books and I have  one by J Graham, so I'll cast my eye
across her poems, time permitting..   Some thoughts on this, Richard.

I agree  on the face of it (the phrase sounds ugly to me)..but maybe not if
his daughter agrees: they should be when children are young (although these
days women an be "at home" but still involved and active in things ...but
taken too literally the phrase has right-wing and restrictive overtones. A
man's place is also in the home (and both out of the home and going through
the home and maybe passed the home)and really the _parents_ place is with
the children but in physical location not alll the time and (time
permitting) the more diverse and "free" their interests the better it is for
the child. (A "dull" house-bound woman is no model for generating
independent and happy children). On the face of it the young man sounds
reactionary: but he may mean that the roles need some implication of
function in the formative years...but in my own daugter's case she is so
overwhelmingly inderpendent .. in fact I sold her a piano (when my ex wanted
just to donate babies clothes  and money and was "shocked" that I wanted to
SELL the piano: its good..I got some cash: she knew that it was not a gift
weakening her independence) and I'm glad she is continuing work for now
(she's "due" in about 31/2 weeks) and also they are both working on their
music (violin guitar piano) and I am urging her to keep up creative
activities and reading (my ex wife was more into the  ("stay at home thing"
I think): nor do I interfere in how they want to operate in their lives...it
sounds as though Tom Bell's son in law  has a coercive approach (and
ultimately it will lead to division and unhappiness) which is  - yes - its
out dated for such countries or places as the US, Europe, Australia nad
NZ....and slowly, in the other  so called "third world" countries, women
will fight for and get independence: that, independence (without a
suggestion of family neglect that some people assume goes with it), is
essential: "a woman's place is in the home" sounds very reactionary: very
unhealthy. Richard.

Phew!

I've been looking at the various twists on this thread with a mixture of
annoyance, interest and too a feeling of disempowerment. Now whatever else I
am I know for sure that I am 'working-class' insofar as the term has
meaning, allowing, as has been rightly pointed out, for the fluidities of
boundary in our world. I left school at sixteen, I've never owned a car, I
live in a tower-block, I've never been a manager or administrator. Etc. At
the same time I write, sometimes on themes that could be thought
'working-class' but not with that label hanging in my mind. I write as one
of so many contingent, threatened human beings, beleaguered by the voids of
unanswerables yet loving the desperate necessary need for rhythm, form,
structure and coherence conjured from their opposites.

That matters of 'class' do impinge on the reception, circulation, validation
of poetry I have no doubt: living in England it's rather hard not to notice
such matters, at the same time I feel very wary of people pasting definition
onto working-class poetry. I suspect the desire to 'control' always.

And that's all.

On April 20, tens of thousands of people from many communities and
movements -- the African American, Latino, Arab, Asian, Native and
other communities of color, union, women, communities of faith,
immigrants, lesbian, gay, bi and trans people, students and youth,
environmentalists and others -- will join together in Washington,
D.C. and San Francisco to take a stand against war and racism.
The Bush program is a disastrous response to the Sept. 11 disaster.
As the U.S. war continues in Afghanistan, a new war in Iraq is being
planned. U.S. troops are now in Yemen, Georgia, the Philippines and
Colombia. U.S. F-16s supplied to Israel are raining death on
Palestinian cities.
The Pentagon is preparing for nuclear war against China, Russia,
Iran, North Korea, Iraq, Syria and Libya! The military budget will
rise to $500,000,000,000 by 2007. The right-wing, militarist
extremists have taken control and are pushing ahead with horrific and
genocidal plans.
We also see a wide-ranging attack on civil rights, civil liberties
and immigrant rights. Millions here and billions around the world
live in poverty, without healthcare, jobs, decent housing and
education. Environmental restrictions are being overturned for the
sake of maximizing corporate profits. There is only one force that
can stop this pro-war, racist, anti-worker offensive -- a mass
people's movement. April 20 will be the next critical step in
building the movement we need. Join us, become an organizer, make a
contribution, get involved. Together we can win!

The drug is the revolution of body / mind from the ageless reason. It is the
frontier story. One person on a quest to find what is there. It is a lonely
quest full of hardships but one fraught with adventure. It turns surrealism
to realism. That factor alone makes time drip.

(It may be a sign of my own creeping conservatism, but
I personally feel uncomfortable with gratuitous
vilification of financial industry professionals.  As
if there were no James Sherry.  And now especially,
after the wholesale slaughter of them in the tens of
hundreds and the leveling force of the Grim Reaper's
scythe has painfully revealed them to be/to have been
little more than workers in their own right.  But
that's not my point here . . .)


Isn't all this discussion of class and class
obligations within poetry missing its propelling
factor, without any corollary sense of ~revolution~
and the poet-revolutionary?  Any attempted analysis of
class, even from a rightist consumer-exploitative
stance, has its basis and origin in, of course, Marx's
class theories.  And that Marxist, post-Marxist or
quasi-Marxist always took its motivating force aginst
class from variously manifested versions of
"revolution."

I have recently been reinvestigating Surrealism, . . .
which partly lost its saliency because the
"engagement" [pronounced "on-gozh-mon-t'"] of
Existentialist commitment segued better into the
concrete '68 revolutions, . . .  and its genuine,
troubled political dimension: Breton co-authored a
paper with Trotsky, many Surrealists "defected" from
the Surrealist Revolution into Communist Party
membership, etc.; so, it's much on mine my mind how,
where, and when both real collaboration with
"revolutionary" political movements and social forces
or a ~myth~ of revolution fuelled the XXth century
avant-garde we're the inheritors of.

The line forward from Surrealism and the October
Revolution is fairly easy to draw: Surrealism out of
the more short-lived, nihilistic and less articulated
Dada forward into Lettrism, Situationism, and perhaps
Lacan and post-structuralism.  But I find myself
faltering --- I need more research or education into
the pre-history of Modernism --- in trying to trail
the line backward chronologically.  The Modernist
precursors, the Impressionists in painting and Les
Symbolistes in poetry, although formally often
continuous with the Cubisms and -isms that flowed out
of or were spawned in reaction against them, on the
face of things do not exactly appear to be
~revolutionary~ in the same sense: rather, the Manet
depictions of men in waist coats and top hats as the
~celebration~ of haute bougeoisie, the Monet leisure,
etc., and, in poetry, end-of-an-era decadence rather
than a generative "revolution,"--- a decadence,
albeit, whose obscurantism remains larger the
prototype and starting point of Modernist and
post-modern obscurantisms, including the current
"asyntactical."

However, despite the occasional formal resemblances,
--- and I know that here and there there must indeed
have been counter examples of sympathies for the
emergent splinter group pre-October Socialists and
utopians that I just am uneducated about, such as (?)
the younger American Whitman or Hawthorne's and the
Transcendalists' Fourier communes --- these
precursors, again, rather than being anti-"capitalist"
seem to typify an ~epitome~ of capital, and their
aesthetic revolution to be on the plane of, say,
innovation in the fashion design of ~haute couture~
clothes, glass stemware (Lalique, Tiffany), and such.


The ~ultra-moderne~ rather than Modernist
"revolution."

For want of a better word, I'm thinking of that high
capitalist ~semblable~ of later anti-capitalist
avant-garde as "High Style."  (Maybe it's a
Mannerism.)  Regardless, it represents a legitimate
moment where formalist relatedness conceals political
antithesis, and demonstrates a Modernism that was
fully dedicated to capital, rather than class
revolution.


(And there was pre-Modernist or even anti-Modernist,
non avant-garde revolutionary art: the realist
classicism of Jean-Louis David's ~Tennis Court Oath,~
etc., which commemorated political upheavals and
~coups d'etat.~)


And, --- pessimistically? --- I wonder if we haven't
come full cycle and, fin-de-siecle again, at the
turning point of both centuries, whether our
particular historical branch --- "hippy" revolutionary
Beat > Black Mountain > Language --- hasn't had the
revolutionary myth effectively drain out of it, --- so
that our current uneasy condition is a ~vestigial~ lip
service to "revolution" but a reversion to High Style
"bourgeois"/middle class conservatism.   The
discrepancy between the lived careerism and MFA-ing of
poetry, the (first generation) New York School
buttoning up back into shocking neckties and blazers
versus the Beat dishevelment, (the journal ~Fence~?)
--- aren't we in a position like the earliest
Modernists, living "the good life," fully trafficking
in the pleasures of capital, and ~only~ observing a
superficial (hypocritical?) ~trace~
pseudo-revolutionariness in formal aesthetic
experimentalism (an experimentalism that has,
meanwhile, obviously become its own paradoxical
conservatisim of an "alternative tradition," perhaps
in fact the ~sole~ keepers of tradition)?

The point being that, without revolution, including a
revolutionary ideology for poetry (~Revolution dans la
Langue Poetique~?), class is merely class,--- and
discussion about its frictions is just moot, neither
here nor there: it's all missing its necessary
leverage ("revolution").

......................................................

Incidentally,---

(Any "revolutionary" agenda, of course, is currently
badly compromised or stifled, like the tepid street
protests against the recent World Economic Forum, by
revolution's indistinguishability from terrorism, or,
for that matter, berserk schizophrenic violence [the
newspaper-certified "schizophrenic" shooting up a post
office, and Baden Meinhof-ish shooting up a post
office], and the reasonable-seeming total clamp-down
of new social controls and revoked civil liberties.)


(. . . And something should later be said about "Drug
Culture," the most covert co-factor of revolutionary
avant-gardism.)  :)

 our love


 self-deprecation going nowhere, there must be a space for structure, not
 anecdote

 audience [laugh] [applause]

 surely you must think, mr. sondheim, that you are stale and have covered
 everything, is it not? it is not.

 is it something else, mr. sondheim. [shrug] [jump]

 yes and surely. we are packing up to leave this life. i cannot think.
 there are crickets and sand midges everywhere. my body is a sieve.

 you are a saint, mr. sondheim. [laugh] [kiss]

 thank you for your consideration. but i have no more stories, i am lazy
 to program, i have no conditions. i must

 audience [query] [yes]

 i must complete my theoretical work so that it is bone, not marrow;
 spine, not tissue, earth, not inconceivable and wobbling space

 mr. sondheim, we are with you in our heart. you are a genius and you must
 do this. we applaud your effort to write when you are packing up to leave
 this life.

 audience [applause] [consternation]

 do not fear, i will work through this with my customary and tremendous
 courage, i will not disappoint

 of course you will not, mr. sondheim, you have never done but brilliant
 through the most amazing consequences that would have haunted and
 weakened anyone else

 audience [empathetic] [poor mr. sondheim]

 but it is true, it is the most slightest true, that i will be doing a
 disappointment to myself, unless i am packing up less and thinking of our
 world and its terrible needs and wants so much more, that i will stop
 packing up and thinking of my theoretical work which is so very important
 to you

 audience [agreement] [wonderful applause]

 i know i can count on you and i promise i will never let you down, i
 would rather my heart shatter and my limbs turn leprous than i will let
 you down, which i will not.

 you are so brave mr. sondheim, i cannot believe how brave you are in this
 dark world, and we are eager readers of your theoretical work, which will
 make us better people who will know about the dark world

 audience [thankful] [eternally grateful]

 thank you thank you, i will produce the greatest work and i will cease
 leaving and will remain forever in your hearts and my books and every
 other writing

 audience [more than thankful] [jump] [wonderfully put]

 that was wonderfully put, mr. sondheim, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Alan,

well, since there is nothing else to do but act...unless we sit around and
moan at slow decay...whimpering etc, etc., what do you think is to be done?

I wanted to send a shout out [whoo hoo] to Mike Basinski, Mark Peters and
company for a wonderful night of sound and performance poetry at the
Trimania event in Buffalo last night. It was a mix of theater of the absurd
meets a greek chorus. It was refreshing. Oh and Jonathan Skinner had a great
reading too. His poems were translated into american sign language which
amplified his twists of language to glorious heights.


                            Best, Geoffrey

Bill. I think you're right (or as "right" as one can be right!) in this
discussion. Murat may be confusing value - or intrinsic value - with the
Marxist (or other economic-philosohic-political) determinationof what a
product is. In capitalism, and many other (most systems that have ever
existed except in very early stages of the formation of civilisation (as
opposed to hunter-gatherers and so on)): the value of a product is basically
its use value to the consumer: so supply and demand comes in: if poetry
suddenly replaced pop-music or movies or pulp fiction that sells in big
stores thousands of poets would become millionnaires, or at least
prosperous. But sex and glamour and hollywood and so on sells: and certain
novels "take of" (most are trash but occasionally a major writer gets big
sales and sometimes a poet - but in general the more significant one is as a
poet (or even an artist) the less successful one is duruing one's life ...
so its better as a poet to just get on with writing and if people take an
interest one day well and good. I am recording myown poems onto CD and then
I might produce some copies of a project (s) i have but beyond that I am
under no ridiculous illusion that many people (or even any) are going to be
interested in an old man's writings: in the real world, the big seller is
sex, violence, fashion, and trivia, drivellania: and so on. A poet who is
amking money out o0f poetry has probably "failed" or is not very good sub
specie aeternitatis. Richard.

\\ MA NEWSLETTER DU DIMANCHE n°005 \\
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SOMMAIRE - SPECIALEMENT PATHETIQUE :

1 - SCOLIE d -
2 - CONFERENCE f) -
3 - SCOLIE e -
4 - RECENSION 15.03.02 -
5 - REFERENCE -
6 - SCOLIE f -
7 - CONFERENCE g) -
8 - SCOLIE g -

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1 - SCOLIE d - Les temps sont durs, les destins les plus sordides propices à
forger des romanciers à succès, sauvagement connus, ravissant une curiosité, ne
pouvent faire l'économie de textes percutants, réactifs, dominés par la rage,
un regard noir sur le monde, une vision glacée de la société... La curiosité
doit se préciser, pour se dédouaner, surfaire son positionnement trop
tranquille, à consommer des martyrs de l'obscur / indus' gothique, pas tant
satanico-horrifique qu'anti-puritain : pour refuser l'apitoiement, convoite
mal la gêne à simuler pour ne pas classer navrant ce qui rend toujours
l'offusquation exactement surannée, exactement comme dans les journaux.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2 - CONFERENCE f) - C'est ce qui fait que cela ne peut pas être une conférence.
Ce serait trop attendre de l'intérêt que vous pouvez y porter. Il faudrait que
je commence par vous dédouaner et que j'investisse dans la confiance nécessaire
à ce que ça prenne une toute autre tournure. Seulement, étant donnée la
situation, il n'est pas possible d'épuiser le thème sans y revenir, sans
emprunter à d'autres : qui venaient, justement, pour l'occasion.
Ô les détours du thème \ Ah \ la résolution se veut scandaleuse \ Ah \ Ah \
mais ses plaidoyers sont moins saisissants que la défense de l'inconséquente \
de dos, aussi, il peut y avoir grand contrôle | dans l'espèce de tenue | qui
pose la détente, minaude une éventuelle noirceur : telle une posture \
révélatrice en permanence \

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3 - SCOLIE e - Cela ne saurait aller sans absorber et sans s'exposer à la verve
réprobatrice des hédonistes vitamineux - émetteurs de diagnostics terrorisants
ou de préceptes sécuritaires intitulés préventifs, mais défenseurs d'une
indépendance, d'abord - [et définitive monomanie addictophobe, avec possibilité
de spécialités éparses]. Doublées de rengaines esthétisantes frelatées, les
réprobations peuvent ne plus savoir ce qu'elles font, il arrive qu'elles se
défendent d'être indiscrètes, de donner dans la confusion, de signer quelques
crispations assurées. Les débats touffus sur le trop peu, le pas plus, le
strict minimum, le grand maximum et le juste assez, appelent un mystère autour
d'une bonne dose - à rompre à qui voudra lancer tant-mieux-pour grand-bien-leur.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4 - RECENSION 15.03.02 - Mais qu'est-ce que le faux zèle que je lui ai
administré ? Pour apparat, il a bien mis un palais impérial, ses codifications
pour heureuses transcriptions avec tristes salutations. Avec ça, il va fort,
continue ainsi en longues nombreuses pages. Le temps de sa détention a servi
pour la narration de, son arrestation. Avant cela, il avait déjà une tonalité
différente, les autres n'étant que des esquisses, plus riches qu'il ne le,
comme Laforgue, Jules, avec encore quelques résonnances dotées, et un calepin
salissant - sur lequel, évidemment -

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5 - REFERENCE - "un printemps qui commence plus tôt que d'habitude est      un
printemps qui commence tard      on dit que le printemps est     parce qu'il ne
fait ni trop chaud ni trop froid quand il pleut souvent le printemps       on
dit : le      printemps parce que c'est la saison où      un printemps     est
un printemps qui fait éclore beaucoup de fleurs le printemps est        par le
parfum des fleurs quand le soleil a de brillants rayons le printemps est     le
printemps est      parce qu'il inspire la joie"
(Olivier Cadiot, L'art poétic', POL, 1997, p. 124)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6 - SCOLIE f - Il est effectivement très important de témoigner d'un certain
recul sur les gloses communes, il faut aller jusqu'à faire preuve d'une
certaine impertinence. Pour autant, "une certaine impertinence" ne fait jamais
vraiment des ravages, cela se ramène très vite à des petites remarques
cocasses. Or, les petites remarques cocasses n'ont pas les mêmes incidences que
n'importe quel ravage, même le plus petit. Une certaine impertinence procure à
son destinataire un air pensif et régalé, faisant au plus des Mmm... Mmm...,
alors qu'un ravage s'attaque à des préjugés plus profonds, crée plus de
secousses, plus d'hésitations, voire quelques inquiétudes et des Euh... Euh...
qui n'ont rien à voir

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

7 - CONFERENCE g) - à qui veut bien se faire l'oraison funèbre - et qui en aura
gratification autant Qu'il s'en voudra formaliser, se répercutera là où il
sait, qu'il y a à dénicher \ la pose de la non-pose \ à cause de la
permanence : teigneuse et discrète. C'est ainsi, qu'en amour : plus qu'en
psychologie : la connaissance de soi doit peaufiner le bonheur : Voilà qui ne
saurait se faire sans le concours d'une espèce | coquinerie bien assez conne |
pour ne pas s'attirer | les revers de la monstruosité | les colères castrées
d'excentricité \ les emportements insignifiants, moins que trop amples.
L'énumération précise : Ah / Ah /

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

8 - SCOLIE g - C'est une mécanique succulente parce qu'il en découle une
affaire plutôt pathétique, avec ce que cela de frelaté, épris de liberté, de
modernité, alors engagés pour quelques dépoussiérages lourds et lourds de
références imposantes et para-para-académiques. Celles-ci exigent un bout de
lorgnette, ne pourront pas se suffir d'un seul aspect désagréable : la patte
est austère, d'effet aléatoire, bénéfique par nécessité, avec l'accompagnement
automatique de bouseux admirateurs des courants les plus - à cause des
déconstructions, souffrant honteusement de quelques réminiscences, aérées de
démagogies pro-débutantes, contre-compétentes, bien sûr, mais par défaut, sous
prétexte échéant que vaut mieux que patho-, aphasique, mais dressé pour ça.

ROCK STAR

Life’s too short. Like, once I read about this weird old woman who like had
one dream in life. . . and that dream was to have sex with a salmon. She
bought a live salmon at a fish market, you know, and like took it home to
have sex with. This is where it gets weird, cuz like she was laying in a
bathtub and like had the fish swim into her (where it counts). Then she like
held it in there and like, poked its eyes and shit so that it would wiggle
all around and give her the pleasure that she was looking for. But she ended
up dying from it, cuz she bought a bad fish. The fish was infested with some
kind of shrimp eggs and they got inside of her and grew into shrimps and
then she died because of it. . . But, hey, it’s totally gross to you and me,
but like, this is what this woman really wanted to do. . . and she did it!
Like, if you tried having sex with a salmon and you get all fucked up and
you end up dead with a fucking pussy full of shrimp, then at least you can
look back at it all and think, "At least tried all that stuff that I wanted
to try…"


AUTHOR’S NOTE

I broke my mother’s tailbone and came out butt-first (everyone thought I was
smiling) when I was first born in Washington, D.C., during the Eisenhower
years. A young man with chiseled hair and windblown features, I turned to
poetry to divert my attention from drugs and sex. As a bohemian my
typewriter was stolen but after a while I got married to a woman who had
stolen a laptop from work. The shadow of a twisted hand across my home at
times discouraged me but I remained true to my school and wrote almost every
day. Although I was not a very good poet I got published a lot but I refused
to compromise. The East Village was undergoing gentrification and we had
entered the 1990s. I got divorced. I had no choice but to write pornography.
Although I would love to stay and chat Mom’s home now and she’s really mad.


BLUE VELVET

My favorite moment in Blue Velvet is when Jeffrey and Sandy first meet. "Are
you the one that found the ear?" Sandy asks. "Yeah. How do you know?"
replies Jeffrey. "I just know, that's all."


THINGS TO GIVE UP FOR LENT

Dinner mints
Collar stays
Chopsticks
Beets


BLACK HOLES

The black holes will be very hard to remove. Especially this one (old hole).


SOURCE CODE

I think I gave you the wrong source code last time we met because I was
reading it upside down. It's 7734.


THE TRUTH

I need to have these little plastic animals around me because I often feel
lonely.


DEAR FRIEND

I was in the army. As an infant. I carried messages in my diapers. No one
dared to search them. But an informer turned me in. I was tortured by the
enemy. I told them nothing. I escaped in the bathwater. Can you find it in
your heart to send me some money?

Yours sincerely,

Krebs


TROMPE L’OEIL


I went to a fancy French restaurant called "Trompe L’Oeil." I couldn’t find
the entrance.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON READERS:
Gail Scott is the author of the novel My Paris (Mercury Press, Toronto,
2001), an experimental fiction set in 90s Paris and authored by a sad
diarist whose travel companions include Walter Benjamin and Gertrude Stein.
It was named one of the top 10 novels published in Canada in 1999 by Canada’
s book trade magazine Quill & Quire. Scott’s other books include the novels
Main Brides, and  Heroine, the essay collection Spaces like Stairs, and
Spare Parts, short stories, to be reissued by Coach House Books in 2002. She
is co-editor of Narrativity and works as a literary translator (shortlisted
for the 2001 Governor-General’s award in translation) and is a teacher of
creative writing in Montréal, where she lives.
Carla Harryman is the author of  Gardener of Stars, an experimental novel
that explores the paradise and wastelands of utopian desire. She has
published ten other books including two volumes of selected writing, There
Never Was a Rose Without a Thorn, Animal Instincts: poetry, prose and plays;
a hybrid novel, The Words after Carl Sandburg’s Rootabaga Stories and
Jean-Paul Sartre; and a book-length dramatic work, Memory Play. Harryman’s
most recent play, “Performing Objects Stationed in the Sub World” was
premiered as a staged reading last year at Oxford Brookes University and
will be read again in San Francisco in February 2002.  Now titled “Stationed
in the Sub World,” the play will open as a full production at Zeitgeist
Theater in April in Detroit, where she lives.
The BELLADONNA*  Reading Series began in August 1999 at the then newly
opened women's bookstore (New York's only) Bluestockings.  In its two year
history, BELLADONNA* has featured such writers as Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe,
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña, Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole
Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole and Lynne Tillman among many other
experimental and hybrid women writers. Beyond being a platform for women
writers, the curators promote work that is experimental in form, connects
with other art forms, and is socially/politically active in content.
Alongside the readings, BELLADONNA* supports its artists by publishing
commemorative pamphlets of their work on the night of the event.  Please
contact Rachel Levitsky and/or visit the website if you would like to
receive a catalog or hear more about our salons.

There will be a short open reading before the featured readers.  A $3
donation is suggested.

For more info on the authors:
MARIE PONSOT
Marie Ponsot is, according to The San Francisco Chronicle, "one of the most
elegant, intelligent poets around."  Her most recent collection of poems,
Springing, will be published by Knopf in March 2002.  Ponsot's other books of
poetry include The Bird Catcher, which won the National Book Critics Circle
Award in 1999, The Green Dark, Admit Impediment, and True Minds. Ponsot, who
also translates books from the French, has taught in graduate programs at
Columbia University, Queens College, Beijing United University, the Poetry
Center of the YMHA, and New York University. Among her awards are a grant
from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Delmore Schwartz Memorial
Prize, and the Shaughnessy Medal of the Modern Language Association.

NELLY ROSARIO
About Song of the Water Saints, Nelly Rosario's debut novel, Julia Alvarez
says, "Like a Caribbean Scheherazade, Rosario casts a spell on her readers
with this saga of three generations of Dominican women whose yearning becomes
our own," and Edwidge Danticat calls it "a gorgeous first novel, epic and
poetic."  Nelly Rosario, named a "Writer on the Verge" by The Village Voice
Literary Supplement for 2001, also has an environmental engineering degree
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Born in the Dominican
Republic, she now lives in Brooklyn.

The News:
Excerpts from a leaked version of a classified Pentagon nuclear weapons
strategy document were posted on the Internet last week. The secret
report, which was provided to Congress on Jan. 8 says the Pentagon needs
to be prepared to use nuclear weapons against China, Russia, Iraq, North
Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria. It says the weapons could be used in three
types of situations: against targets able to withstand nonnuclear attack;
in retaliation for attack with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons;
or "in the event of surprising military developments."

It is the last category, "in the event of surprising military
developments" which diverts from business as usual.

Here are some words from the report that would be useful to deconstruct.

Excerpts from the source: "Nuclear Posture Review"
http://GlobalSecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/npr.htm

As a result of this review, the U.S. will no longer plan, size or
sustain its forces as though Russia presented merely a smaller version
of the threat posed by the former Soviet Union. Following the direction
laid down for U.S. defense planning in the Quadrennial Defense Review,
the Nuclear Posture Review shifts planning for America's strategic
forces from the threat-based approach of the Cold War to a capabilities-
based approach. This new approach should provide, over the coming
decades, a credible deterrent at the lowest level of nuclear weapons
consistent with U.S. and allied security.
....
Second, we have concluded that a strategic posture that relies solely on
offensive nuclear forces is inappropriate for deterring the potential
adversaries we will face in the 21st century. Terrorists or rogue states
armed with weapons of mass destruction will likely test America's
security commitments to its allies and friends. In response, we will
need a range of capabilities to assure friend and foe alike of U.S.
resolve. A broader array of capability is needed to dissuade states from
undertaking political, military, or technical courses of action that
would threaten U.S. and allied security. U.S. forces must pose a
credible deterrent to potential adversaries who have access to modern
military technology, including NBC weapons and the means to deliver them
over long distances. Finally, U.S. strategic forces need to provide the
President with a range of options to defeat any aggressor.
....
''Nuclear weapons play a critical role in the defense capabilities of
the United States, its allies, and friends. They provide credible
military options to deter a wide range of threats ... Greater flexibility
is needed with respect to nuclear forces and planning than was the case
during the Cold War ... Nuclear-attack options that vary in scale,
scope, and purpose will complement other military capabilities.''
....
“Today’s nuclear arsenal continues to reflect its Cold War origin,
characterized by moderate delivery accuracy, limited earth-penetrator
capability, high-yield warheads, silo- and sea-based ballistic missiles
with multiple independent reentry vehicles, and limited retargeting
capability.”
....
“New capabilities must be developed to defeat emerging threats such as
hard and deeply buried targets (HDBT), to find and attack mobile and
relocatable targets, to defeat chemical or biological agents, and to
improve accuracy and limit collateral damage.”


An aside:
In recent months, when Bush administration officials talked about the
implications of Sept. 11 for long-term military policy, they have often
focused on "homeland defense" and the need for an anti-missile shield. In
truth, what has evolved since last year's terror attacks is an
integrated, significantly expanded planning doctrine for nuclear wars.
(from: LOS ANGELES TIMES Commentary, "Secret Plan Outlines the
Unthinkable" by WILLIAM M. ARKIN, March 10 2002)

Another aside:
U.S. readiness to use nuclear weapons resides solely with the president.

Treading on Kings: Protesting the G8 in Genoa
______________________________________________________________
Opening reception: Friday, 22 March - 6-8pm
...through 27 April 2002

    The 26th Summit Meeting  of the  G8, the informal discussion club
of the leaders of the world's most industrialized nations which took
place in Genoa, Italy in the summer of 2001 left hundreds of protestors
arrested, 600 or more injured and one person dead.
    In an attempt to document this historic event in a manner that would

equal voice to those who took to the streets, the artist /photographer
Joel Sternfeld made portraits of demonstrators and recorded their
responses to an essential question; why have you come to Genoa?
     These portraits with text and other related images: President Bush
arriving at the Ducale Palace, blood on the floor of an elementary
school
being used as a dormitory after a midnight police raid, and a picture of

a funerary box holding the cremated remains of Carlo Giuliani are
intended to form a basis for discussion of the events in Genoa - and of
the attendant issues of globalization.

JAZZ LOVER’S PARADISE AT PENN STATE

At Penn State the weekend of April 5th and 6th will be a jazz lover’s paradise. On Friday, the 5th, the world renowned Archie Shepp and Roswell Rudd quartet (Shepp and Rudd, along with Andrew Cyrille and Reggie Workmam), will be joined for a performance in Schwab Auditorium at 8PM by the internationally known poet and activist Amiri Baraka. On Saturday the 6th, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Orchestra will appear in Eisenhower Auditorium at 8PM.

Shepp and Baraka are appearing as part of the symposium “Free Jazz and It’s Legacies: A Symposium on Black Music And American Culture.”   The coincidence of Shepp and Baraka’s performances with that of Marsalis offers a wonderful opportunity to make jazz a subject of productive conversation. To this end, Professors William J. Harris and Paul Youngquist of the Department of English have organized the symposium around the tissues of free jazz--a radical black music which originated in the 1960spolitics, and the legacies and implications of this music. Panel discussions are scheduled for 1:30 to 5:00PM on Saturday the 6th, in Foster Auditorium in Pattee Library.

Baraka and Shepp’s panel will be joined by the acclaimed music critic, John Szwedthe author of Space is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Raand Barry Kernfeld, the distinguished editor of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. The roundtable will discuss the subject of improvisation with Vincent Colapieto--a philosopher; Cecil Giscombe--a poet; Arthur Goldstein--a pianist; Elaine Richardson--a scholar-singer, and Vorris Nunley--a graduate student in English. The symposium and concert are free and open the public.
 For further information contact William J. Harris(wjh8@psu.edu) or Paul Youngquist(pby1@psu.edu) or Department of English (814-865-6384).

My objection to JG's poetry is not that is looks tame-- I love tame writing.
William Stafford has a kind of tameness, and so does Dickinson, as you've
pointed out.  It's just that she doesn't seem to have much to actually say.
The flickering, stuttering, clever-perspective thing seems to me to have
become a shtick.  You're right about the cleverness.  Also, I think she has
no sense of humor, or in terms of style, no elasticity.

But let's not 'be dismissive of other poets'; you're right.  Maybe we can be
dismissive of other poems.  If you find a good Jorie Graham poem, by all
means, type it in & email it.

    Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad

Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

Hi,
I like the Housing Works Used Bookstore at Crosby (the alley east of
Broadway)and Houston. All the money raised by the bookstore goes towards
housing and other programs for people with HIV and Aids.
It can be hit and miss since its all donated books, but I always find
treasures (last night I saw Anne Waldman's Iovis and Olsen's Maximus poems
there).  Also sometimes you can spot Tuli Kuperberg hanging out. Its got
tables and chairs, cafe and nice restrooms.

I can't find any obituary notices on Hine, but as recently as last year he
published a set of translations, *Puerilities:  Erotic Epigrams of The
Greek Anthology* (Princeton UP) (tidbits for the man-boy set).  I
understand he's been mostly involved in classical translation recently,
including a new bilingual Homer.

Alan,

well, since there is nothing else to do but act...unless we sit around and
moan at slow decay...whimpering etc, etc., what do you think is to be
done?

Gene


What is to be done - for me is to act, no matter how pessimistic I am -
teaching is part of this; it's a question of impulse. I meant to write
"raising the fist" btw - not "raising the first" - I think the phrase is
from an old book of Bernard Henri-Levy. As atheist, I have trouble wait-
ing as well for some spiritual pandemonium or salvation.

It's a question for me of separation what seems to be a dark future from
teleology.

Alan

What is "intrinsic value?" Class has a lot to do with money, in other words,
the market value of your work as "product" in the cycle of production.
Richard, as you yourself imply, if poetry became desirable like pop music,
and some poets became through their "poems," wouldn't that change things at
least in two ways: 1) if from a 10,000-dolla- a-year person you became a
millionaire, don't you think this will change your class status? 2) and more
important, if you were making millions out of your poems, don't you think
that would affect the kind of poetry you will write. Don't you think you
would write ways to "please" that market, in extreme cases, do market
research, add "hooks" to your poems, etc., etc. These aspects make the poem a
"product."

Because, in poetry (particularly in the States), there is no such "ready
public, the writing process has no such implicit contract, as the originator
of the poem, with the  public. This is both a limitation and a positive
thing. The limitation: the question of a poem mirroring one's time, one's
values (which art historically does) becomes more problematic. On the other,
this lack of contract gives the poet, potentially at least, if he or she
dares to acknowledge the reality of this position, an absolute freedom to
experiment (acknowledging the possibility of absolute dismissal by the
public). That's why I call poetry a consumption, a"process," and split it
from its after-life in public.

"Intrinsic value" is a deceptive term blurring the issue. The word gives the
impression (in my opinion, the illusion) that there is a value "beyond,"
"above" market value. Actually, I think, that value is the psychological
value to the poet/writer; its value as process, which is what the poet has to
originate the process.

Labyrinth on 112th just off Broadway isn't bad either, and if by chnace they
don't have the book, you can always check and the new Columbia/B&N place on
11th or at Papyrus on 113th.  But Labyrinth has the distinction of having
only "good" books -- ie academic, "literature" (no mass paperbacks, no genre
books, no books with lurid covers, etc etc), and poetry.  That makes it good
for findng iction in a way because it's presorted, but the browsing
experience is strangely altered by the lack of Steven King books to sneer at
while on one's wy to buy the ;atest Geoffrey Hill poetry book in hardback...

The B&N at 82nd & Bway and at 67th & Bway have decent poetry sections (alas,
as there uysed to be an independent bookstore , Shakespeare & Co. around
83rd), but not as good as Labyrinth (btw all the books there are upsteairs;
the really puny poetry section on the fiorst floor is supposed to be new
books but they aren't that new imho; otoh they have great sales on the
stairs).

St. Marks is a Great Bookstore as none of the above are but I don't know if
its poetry section is actually larger than the ones above.

Another good place is Gotham Book Mart, located at 47th(?) St Btwn 6th - 7th
Ave. (It's the diamond market street which has diamond stores and big fake
diamonds at its intersections with avenues, and the store is half
underground and a little hard to find therefore). It is only open business
hours whihc is a pain.  There you can find mostly used books and
unfortunately the poetry section consists of some shelved books and a table
with a huge pile of other books, but you can find things there that are
nowhere else and you pay the price written on them originally.  You can't go
there with a title in mind and expect to get ot necessarily but there are
great things in the pile.  Gotham also has original drawings & books by
Edmund Gorey, which are very expensive, and a lot of ordinary affordable
Gorey stuff.  It may be NYC's oldest bookstore.  I think it makes that
claim.  But the stock is too aleatory to use the store as one's "regular".

Gotham Book Mart is also known for hosting the Finnegan's Wake Society:
(212) 226-8903 to find out meeting times.  The meetins consist entiresly of
reading aloud (!!!!) and figuring out allusions and glosses in Finnegan's
Wake.  The group has gone through the whole book once already but people are
happy to be doing it again with new blood in the group.  I went once and
they were very friendly.  When you go there, you have to have a copy of the
Penguin Finnegan's Wake, and they give you a Society bookmark which has line
numbers on it, so you can speak up and say, "on line bla, where it says..."
Be prepared to laugh; the people there are very erudite but they have a
sense of humor and obviously FW is a funny book.

Which of us is blaspheming and about what? That Jorie is good or bad or is
this to Joe who said she "sucks"?   But I appreciate your humour either way.
Maybe its because I rambled on too long?!  But in mater absentia: my mother
having died in 1998 ... I'll suggest to some other personage of note:
possibly Bill Manhire -  the great (NZ) poet and potential ( temporaily)
"honorary" member of the local Glitterati of Wellington (which is a rather
dour and windswept city I'm told)  - I think he stole some ideas from Jorie
Graham: but he is probably well versed in the usages of soap as he is the
pen or quill or what you will...  Richard.

I dont think that "working class poetry" (put like that) has much meaning
(but certainly we are all I think in some way connected to some strand or
admixture of class which coupled with our genotype has more or less
significance at different times): I'm one better than you I've never bought
a NEWcar! But every man and his dog in NZ owns a car except for some reason
Wystan Curnow doesnt: I had to drive him from a reading  he gave: which by
the way was very interesting (not the drive but W C's reading) (althoughthe
drive was interesting in a sort of way) (not as interesting as I imagine a
drive with the younger Robert Creeley) ... in fact the working class are the
first to buy cars and TVs and so on: but before this debate began I was
thinking "what if we had a (greatly) more egalitarian world moving toward
some war-free Utopia: now we are all (more or less) on an equal footing and
how does the poetry go? What sort of poetry woulfd be written?) But I think
that what Mao points out is true that the struggle between classes, intra
class, and the various struggles of ideas (which have their origion way back
in time possibly in societies where class as we know it, or think of, would
be either absent or very different) of what is right and wrong, the struggle
for production and so on will continue for many generations even if some
kind of "advanced" system such as Socialism is in place in which the working
class supposedly control the state and hence the means of
production...possibly forever: it may be that such an egalitarian society is
impossible: who knows ....  I like the idea of writing things that are
"meaningless"..that is they are thus "transcendent": they have there value
intrinsically and no care for "outside" influences ideas or things such as
class, politics, and so on: but in subtle ways we are influenced by these
things (or the reception of what a writer writes is).... John Geraets,
editor of "Brief" doesnt believe in politics per se, and focuses on
aesthetics: which in some ways I can se aesthetics is non-political or
non-class. But when a mag like his has writers who ignore vital issues in
the world one starts to have misgivings. Is the obsession with the word and
aesthetics becoming "brutalising"...ok I'm exaggerating a bit here..I dont
agree with a friend of mine who said that he and Michelle Leggott are in a
"closed shop", or thaht "they" are all post-modernists and thus  it shows
how post modernism leads  (or can) to fascism (so can any ism so lead) but
there is a sense of that - just as many of the contributors to Language
poetry are influenced by Zukofsky (but one feels that they want to "own"
Zukofsky) .. but they elide the significance (or paradox) of his connection
with the racist (and certainly no friend of the working class) Ezra Pound,
and the complex of his poetry being "difficult" and yet -  in a subtle way -
that difficulty is sometimes more politically significant than very crudely
blasted out statemental or didactic work...Zukofsky's (perhaps - too -  or
near nuerotically?) devotion to his small, nuclear family, is a good thing,
(or is it a turning away , a turning in and away from humanity?).... or can
be, but conflicts with "socialism" ... in a simple sense I can feel for
that - most of my life I've not been particularly "working class" in my
symapthies ... in fact before S11 shocked me awake I was trying to "drift
away" into a poeisis of my own. Switch off the TV and burn all newspapers
without reading them: ignore the news..but it didnt work...The issues are
complex. But interesting. Ramble completed....for now...Richard.

Just published: "The Lost America of Love: A Genealogy," a rereading of
Sherman Paul's 1981 book on Creeley, Dorn, and Duncan. The New Americans,
it turns out, are the royal road to obdurate textuality, ideology critique,
and authoritarian will. The essay appears in a special issue of Genre on
"Desert Island Texts," the conceit of which is that one is  to write about
a book one would like to be stranded on a desert island with. It turned
out  that I ended up with a book I did not much like, but had all the time
in the world to write an essay on--one that is retrospective in many
senses. The issue (vol. 33, nos. 3-4, Fall/Winter 2000) should be in most
college or university and even public libraries, and contains desert island
disquisitions by Jonathan Culler, Marjorie Perloff, Charles Altieri,
Katherine Hayles, Vincent Leitch and others. All critics. I am not quite
sure what I am doing on that island. If you can't find it at a library, you
could contact the editor, Tim Murphy, Dept. of English, Univ. of Oklahoma,
Norman, OK 73019, or by e-mail at <tmurphy@ou.edu>.

I've got a volume of translations he did from the
Greek Anthology, published last year by Princeton UP
(called Puerilities).  I gather he's still extant.
The book's worth looking at--witty and smutty, like
the original.

I'm doing a little spring cleaning/poetry
house-keeping, and realized that I haven't heard back
from the following journals despite my best efforts to
contact them, and each of them has had my work for
more than a year and a half. Anyone have any info on
any of these?  Backchannel would be great, though
maybe this info is useful to others as well...

Aaron. a Jorie Graham fan will probably come to her rescue, but a thing I
noticed when I did a bit of reviewing (not as impressive as it sounds, a
brief stint, but interesting) was that poets that I found were
"philosophically" or and thus poetically not initially interesting: or who
others who maybe "should know"  "knew" were bad - however one defines bad -
turned out often to have written a number of good poems. This was because,
as a reviewer: possibly in some respects and sometimes the best readers are
reviewers - it should be a serious business - I had to look very closely at
the poems. Poems, that, in a mag, I would probably give up on: but when I
"zoomed in" so to speak these poets gave me pleasure.
  But I presume you've had a close look at Graham's poetry...I havent
really: I cant be a Harold Bloom and read everything in the Universe, but I
will send a poem of hers if I get "turned on" by anything she's written...
  As to "tame" writing, I meant "challenging" formally or "cutting edge" and
so on: Dickinson is formally original: and of course was and is an original.
(I wouldnt call her tame - but I think I know what you're implying) To be
honest, in one sense I find her difficult, because I have difficulty with
abstractions .. but the meaningfulness of Dickinson (in poems I have really
been moved by..what term to use! ?)  is beyond mere literal and discursive
or narrational meaning..in a way she was a mystic: a seer a poet...a real
poet..they are always passed over. A great poet may not do anything for the
"advancement" of lit.  I think Stein is great and did, Shakespear possibly
great but didnt...but my reactions, these are my reactions...I think when
you say she has nothing "meaningful" to say you are actually saying she
hasnt got a poetic voice: I havent read Finnegan's Wake but one day i heard
an excerpt of Joyce reading it and that convinced me that it is a great
poem: some of Auden's early poems are as haunting as the best of Yeats but
God knows what either of them are talking about, Ahsbery  is -  , the
langpo's are -   I -  you  - he - she - look I;m breaking up!
   So I'll leave the Big Suck question to a learned J Grahamist (for now)
Richard.

So: you like Graham or you dont?  If you know a good poem: you can prove
she's good  to Aaron by sending him an example... but seriously, how do we
evaluate or differentiate good and bad poems? Aaron thinks her "cleverness"
simply hides a shallowness: I dont know, I'm putting a bob each way as
usual. Richard.

ALAN HALSEY, GERALDINE MONK & MARTIN CORLESS-SMITH

an open discussion on
New British Poetry

Three of Britain's outstanding contemporary poets make a rare appearance:

*  ALAN HALSEY, born in London in 1949, is a poet, book dealer, publisher,
and graphic artist, whose remarkable works ("fierce and quiet . . .
determined, and without illusion, the kind of poetry we need") include A
Robin Hood Book (West House), The Text of Shelley's Death (Five Seasons),
and Wittgenstein's Devil: Selected Writing 1978-1998 (Stride).  He ran the
Poetry Bookshop in Hay-on-Wye from 1981-96, and lives with Geraldine Monk
in Sheffield.

        49. White crows.

        50. Plains beyond the cliffs. We asked the dice for direction.

        51. The city was clear through the ice. Rooves broken in but good
mortar in the walls and the flesh like wax on the bodies. Men clinging to
the women like priests to their 'suns.'

        52. Further north than men ever journeyed.

        53. We were possessed and dispossessed, poor fish, freely caught.

        54. Our dreams are simple.

        55. Without blame.

        (from "55 Texts for the Journey")

* GERALDINE MONK was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, in 1952, and is
celebrated as a reader and performer of "genuine word magic . . . a
wonderful poet: revelatory, intense, ever surprising."  She regularly works
with improvised musicians; her collaboration with Martin Archer, Angel High
Wires, was issued on CD by Voiceprint in 2001.  Her recent books include
Noctivagations (West House), Interregnum, a sequence of poems on the Pendle
Witches (Creation Books), and The Sway of Precious Demons: Selected Poems
(North and South).

        on trees -- longer than
        longings
        may spring
        unrestrained
        sing yeah -- sing nay
        sing-sigh.

        (from "Songings & Strangerlings")

Halsey's and Monk's works have appeared in many anthologies, including
Conductors of Chaos (Picador 1996), Other: British and Irish Poetry since
1970 (Wesleyan UP 1999) and Anthology of Twentieth-Century British & Irish
Poetry (Oxford UP 2001).

* Martin Corless-Smith is from Worcestershire, England, and has lived in
the U.S. since 1992.  His books ("highly original" works of "a remarkable
emotional range") include Complete Travels, (West House Books 2000) and Of
Piscator (University of Georgia Press 1998).  His poetry "manages the
almost impossible:  to make contemporary techniques combine with the
traditional in such a way that he turns on its head both the old and the
new" (Chelsea).  He has also edited an Anthology of Anonymous Middle
English Lyrics, forthcoming from Marsilio Press.  He has an MFA from the
Iowa Writers Workshop and a PhD from the University of Utah, and is
currently an Assistant Professor of English at Boise State University.  He
also has an MFA in painting.  He is married to the poet Catherine Wagner
and together they spend half the year chasing around England.

I liked these: I had a quick look and have added them to my favourites: I
always find this kind of stuff interesting and it doesnt bother me if
(initially at least or even never) no "wider" meaning than my initial
response is gleaned: or even if it looks like something out of "in the
American trtee"  ..doesnt matter.  I liked the one  (they were all
interesting) that goes  "good is... "   and " goodness is   ... " and so on
in a list: it gave me an idea for a way of working. Which is one of the
things that the many strains of Language Poetry can do: the possiblilities
are not exhausted even if as you point out in your "bio" there are a lot of
poets who are derivative of it or seem so: that may not matter.  I think
though that you have inadvertently "hit" on a way of dealing with the
"issue" .. I found the bio interesting and that coupled with the poems: and
some leadup to each or commentary would distinguish you from the "dour"
"here it is  YOU figure it all out"  ..well, yes, up to a point, but some
comments like the ones you gave would amake a reader (say the introvert you
more or less were - I was like that in my late teens and early 20s: used to
agonise whether - or even where to get - the right kind of shoes: and
clothes, or what I would ever say to any one: couldnt understad what peole
were all talking aobout or what: so I used to stay away and say
nothing...but I think more people are interested in those bio things than
you think: that's why i like the idea of Robert Lowell's "Life Studies"  ...
I say the IDEA of unless someone accuses me of liking or promoting Lowell
(that's a different issue)...I mean his method of working: (in another
direction Williams's "Spring and All" with the prose/poetry alternations.
  Any 'ow: my response for what its worth. Life is once: lets all talk.
Thanks for those links, Richard.

Dear David (Bircumshaw)

What a breath of fresh air your post.

Out. Early. Today. On the way to work.
Writing poetry in snatches. There. And in transit.

Rodrigo Toscano

New York City


"Phew!

I've been looking at the various twists on this thread with a mixture of
annoyance, interest and too a feeling of disempowerment. Now whatever else I
am I know for sure that I am 'working-class' insofar as the term has
meaning, allowing, as has been rightly pointed out, for the fluidities of
boundary in our world. I left school at sixteen, I've never owned a car, I
live in a tower-block, I've never been a manager or administrator. Etc. At
the same time I write, sometimes on themes that could be thought
'working-class' but not with that label hanging in my mind. I write as one
of so many contingent, threatened human beings, beleaguered by the voids of
unanswerables yet loving the desperate necessary need for rhythm, form,
structure and coherence conjured from their opposites.

That matters of 'class' do impinge on the reception, circulation, validation
of poetry I have no doubt: living in England it's rather hard not to notice
such matters, at the same time I feel very wary of people pasting definition
onto working-class poetry. I suspect the desire to 'control' always.

And that's all.

Best

Dave

DISCOUNT FOR RETURNING STUDENTS
If you took a course at trAce between June 01 and April 02, you qualify for a one-time discount of 10 UK pounds off any course or the online workshop (may not be used in conjunction with any other offer). Please quote Code RTYR1 when booking.

"This course allowed me to focus on my writing in a way I never have in 'realtime' classes because there aren't the distractions of daily meetings, but it had all the advantages of other people's considered responses, as well as a thoughtful, honest and skilled tutor who seemed to know just how to make us push into new zones. And all being online, you don't lose most of the comments and responses as you do listening in a room, you download them to think about." Student, 2001

Arielle,

I can tell you that _Nine to Zero_ is sadly defunct (unless Jacques Debrot
has decided otherwise after the fact).  _6500_ kept my work for well over a
year before responding to me (rejection), and _Big Allis_ never acknowledged
my submission (that was over four years ago).  As far as I know, both of the
latter two are still operative.

Posted for Dene Grigar:



Dene Grigar here, inviting you to the upcoming Computers and Writing 2002
Online Conference to be held from Sunday, April 14 to Saturday, May 25,
2002 at Nouspace (http://www.eaze.net:7000).

My Co-Chair Heather Jensen and I are kicking off this year's conference
with a "Gala," replete with virtual fireworks, compliments of Jan Rune
Holmevik on Sunday, on April 14 at 7:30 p.m. CST at the Fountain of the
Avatars in Nouspace.  Please join us on that evening for the festivities.

We have scheduled some exciting other events, too.  N. Katherine Hayles,
Fred Kemp, Espen Aarseth, Wendlyn Alter, and Michael Williamson are among
the keynoters at the special Sunday night Plenary Chats.  The Multi-Media
Electronic Literature Online features Diana Slattery, Margie Luesebrink,
Mark Amerika, Jeff Parker, Nick Montfort, and Jennifer Ley.  Special
events include a virtual tour of The Women's Museum, as well as the "Best
of Kairos" and Web Around the World exhibits, Virtual Wine Tasting
(compliments of Susan Lang), the First Annual Virtual Scrabble Tournament
(compliments of Michael Day), and a Friday night social called "Nightcap."

Mondays and Saturdays are devoted to scholarly presentations called
"Topica;"  Tuesdays, to the Online Workshops;  and Wednesdays, for GRN
Online events.  Online discussions take place all week via the conference
listserv.  You can see a complete list of events on the Schedule of the
conference website (http://www.eaze.net/~dene/cw2002.html).

The CW2002 Online Conference is FREE, but we encourage you to register so
that we can include you in the listserv discussions and provide you with
resident privileges in Nouspace.  You can register by filling out the
(brief) information at http://www.eaze.net/~dene/cw2002_registration.html.

I have made a special invitation for the conference.  You can see it at
http://www.eaze.net/~dene/webinvitation.html.

Once again, I hope you will join Heather and me.  I, for one, would love
to see you online at our conference.

Best,
Dene Grigar, Chair, CW2002 Online Conference

Alan Etal. Every generation bemoans their zeitgeist: I believe various of
the Latins and the Greeks and probably the ancients of every culture at
times bemoaned their existential and teleological fate (a good word that -
teleological: problem it has a theological and a philosophical meaning in my
dictionary)...but there is a difference between having a "dark view" and
being, in one self at least, quite happy: often though people confuse the
seeming dark future (as if anyoone could see the future) with the need
(almost) to be unhappy: but whether or not one is unhappy is - all theings
being equal and disregarding extreme tragedy or unusual pain etc in one's
life - is, as I say, up to the individual. Its a choice: the positive of to
be or not to be. An example: my mother was home-bound in 1997 so I had to
look after her a lot and was thus quite home-bound (and our finances were in
a very bad shape): it became an ordeal getting away even to just to a
library: now I became (or made myself) quite depressed, but I decided to
read Dr Wayne Dwyer's book "Your Erroneous Zones" which is the best book I
have ever read: I used concepts in there to turn the "depression" around and
now have none: I feel good all the time. I control any negative thoughts and
so on. That said: I'm not talking I bacame a Buddhist and departed this
world! Just improved my way of looking at things and my own general
well-being. Note I said CONTROL not ELIMINATED ... one cannot eliminate
suffering: but it can be fought and dealt with largely ... it is in fact an
ongoing (maybe never ending) struggle....
  Sub specie aeternitatis etc and in truth the world and everything does/can
look rather grim - and even possibly in the short human term -wars poverty
Bush and so on - but why let those things interfere with one's own
happiness: what is the use of being a "miserable genius"? Answer: none. In
fact probably we can do nothing about Bush or wars or the "human condition"
(we can all do small things probably like helping someone less fortunate
than ourselves, or donating some money to a cause or a kind act here and
there.... There is only one life and we are lucky to have it and its
fascinating (if grim at times) and over here its sunny and I can see blue
corn flowers and I'm alive...Ok I wont start writing like Christ or
cummings: I'll spare you the need to shudder!
   The future may seem dark but think of all the toiling and near  starving
millions of suffering people without flush toilets and all that kinda
stuff... Think: even politicians suffer from piles and so on... (All that
said I like a bit of dark sometimes)....Think of Spike Milligan...Richard.

Daryl Hine was nice enough to have accepted a poem of
mine for ~Poetry~ (Chicago) when I was nineteen

whe he was editor there.  If I can find a copy of that
issue anywhere in my rummage, I'll post the poem, . .
. as a sort of grateful measure of where the
yesteryear of "liberal" poetry once stood and his
generosity and progressivism as editor.  It was Hine,
too, of course, who was also the editor under whom
~Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror~ and other "daring"
poems first appeared.  It was a brief window of
opportunity that that otherwise inertia-driven journal
enjoyed . . . although  looking at Hine's on-line
credits may, rather, offer a reinterpretation of Self
Portrait's premiere and other New York School ~Poetry~
debuts, such as Charles North's (???) ~Works on
Paper,~ as having made it past the transom on the
strength of Hine's misreading them for their
~scholasticism~ rather than for their futurity.

You have to suspend disbelief and, regardless of how
they read now, try to see these (at least) odd poems
through this Time Tunnel distorting prism of their
incubation, to imagine what they must've seemed like
in 1987.  ~There was nowhere to get rid of them.~

Despite the numerousness of the poets in ~In American
Tree,~ that volume was almost like a forced round-up
or voluntary self-quarantine or ~detention camp~ of
avant-gardism, and there ~simply wasn't~ that much of
this kind of stuff floating around, unlike now.  Of
course ~In American Tree~ had dozens of poets: pariahs
were packing it like Noah's Ark.

I think some of the "historical value" of bringing
these misbegottens out of hiding may be to re-visit or
"re-experience" the now taken-for-granted inaugural
moment of Language Poetry's national unveiling
through the something of a ~misinterpretation,~ or
~1987~ rather than 2002 perspective, that these poems
place on the movement,

---subsequently having proliferated in unanticipated
and autonomous and, in its own way, equally
misinterpretive directions,

versus the slightly different, cock-eyed angling that
such contemporaneous "imitation" or such a very first,
first, inchoate ripple of "post-Language" evidently
gave to the source models at the moment of their
original launching.

What is "intrinsic value?" Class has a lot to do with money, in other words,
the market value of your work as "product" in the cycle of production.
Richard, as you yourself imply, if poetry became desirable like pop music,
and some poets became through their "poems," wouldn't that change things at
least in two ways: 1) if from a 10,000-dolla- a-year person you became a
millionaire, don't you think this will change your class status? 2) and more
important, if you were making millions out of your poems, don't you think
that would affect the kind of poetry you will write. Don't you think you
would write ways to "please" that market, in extreme cases, do market
research, add "hooks" to your poems, etc., etc. These aspects make the poem a
"product."

Because, in poetry (particularly in the States), there is no such "ready
public, the writing process has no such implicit contract, as the originator
of the poem, with the  public. This is both a limitation and a positive
thing. The limitation: the question of a poem mirroring one's time, one's
values (which art historically does) becomes more problematic. On the other,
this lack of contract gives the poet, potentially at least, if he or she
dares to acknowledge the reality of this position, an absolute freedom to
experiment (acknowledging the possibility of absolute dismissal by the
public). That's why I call poetry a consumption, a"process," and split it
from its after-life in public.

"Intrinsic value" is a deceptive term blurring the issue. The word gives the
impression (in my opinion, the illusion) that there is a value "beyond,"
"above" market value. Actually, I think, that value is the psychological
value to the poet/writer; its value as process, which is what the poet has to
originate the process.

Thanks Richard, and Murat for the imput.  George Bataille has much to say in
The Accursed Share about excess in production, and Derrida is no slouch on
that issue either -- but that's for another time.  Murat, your question re:
the millionaire's tendency to meet market demands has that rhetorical flavor,
as if the answer were obvious.  You're correct, I think; it is obvious.  The
answer is that it depends on whether or not the author is a hack.  Ginsberg,
for example, produced "Howl" without knowing how it would do in the
marketplace of ideas and folding green.  He could not have foreseen the
government's attack on City Lights Bookstore which made him famous.  We
assume, I assume, that "Howl" represents his authentic vision and
methodology.  Years into his career, and well past his first million,
Ginsberg was producing "Contest of the Bards," "Plutonian Ode," and a whole
lotta other poems that evinced the same aesthetic gesture as did "Howl."  His
vision did not change, in the main.  So Ginsberg did not pander.  On the
other hand, Jackson Pollock, whose dribbling on canvas was likewise in the
dark re: its own coming reception, did change post-success.  Another example
of an artist who followed his own vision regardless of marketplace success.
There are certainly hundreds of such examples.  Yet both artists had a "ready
market," to use your term.  Are Ashbery and Creeley issuing product (since
both have ready markets), while you and I, say, are involved only in process?

I most certainly agree with you that there is a value beyond market share.
But this is what I mean when I suggest that your working definition of
"product" restricts itself to economic viability.  Why do that?  As
poststructuralists (even many Marxists) would acknowledge, the self itself is
a product of language, despite its not being available at the local
convenience store.  Every process is also a product in the sense that it
issues from an agent and agency.  And that agency is itself a product, and so
forth.

I still think the quibble, always already deconstructed, is more about how
one chooses to limit or delimit the term "product."  I'm going for the
complete dictionary entry.  Best, Bill

  The cases of pederastry in the Cath. Church....mysterium iniquitas...might get us to smell the sheets of our own po unmade beds...

  Reading a review (two weeks ago?) of Andrea Dworkin's HEARBREAK..in NYTIMES book review....nota an exchange tween Ms Drworkin and our own very very po  Mr Ginsberg..over similiar behaviour of his..."what would you do to me...put me in jail" asks Po Ginsie...."no, i'm not a liberal...i'd shoot you" Ms Dworkin...

    My own delusional fantasies of the axis of evil of the Rimp-Gins necropolis empire are too well known...for me to be an impartial judge...& i find it a more complex question than a Ms...if Catullus could bang at 12 yr old boys....let's leave Rimbaud and Verlaine back to back...

    The further question both in Church and Po is not sex but POWER....and its uses...FAME and its disabuses...Po is both a ladder and whip...step up on it..and touch the scars...DRn..

Richard,
     I'm glad you realized that I was kidding around. The soap gargle comment
was meant for Joe, who said she 'sucks'. The blasphemy just burst forth
because Jorie so often writes about God, and I thought Joe's comment was
insulting and contemptous. I wish poets as a group could get beyond this need
to insult what they themselves don't like. There are plenty of us around that
can fit any sort of bill you need. I'd like the poetry community to become
more inclusively peculiar. And, while I admire his passion, maybe Joe's need
is to be the 'heat that seeks the flaw in everything.' So, I am on record as
being a Jorie Graham fan. I especially liked The Dream of the Unified Field
when she writes, "Everyone in here wants to be taken off/somebody's list,
wants to be placed on somebody else's list."
Karen

        Hi Gene,

        Not so sure who they are but I do know that drugs are not an
answer for much. But the combination of drug culture is intertwined in
the avant garde, for better and worse. Who would Burroughs be without
his morphine?


        Best, Geoffrey

Thought I'd point listmembers in the direction of the new _Cambridge
Quarterly_, which is the first of two issues edited by Geoff Ward & devoted
to contemporary poetry.  The issue is for the time available online in PDF
form:

http://www3.oup.co.uk/camquj/current/

& has, among other things, John Wilkinson's superb review of three
anthologies of 20th-c. British & Irish poetry, including Keith Tuma's Oxford
book.  It is probably, with Stephen Burt's piece in _Boston Review_, the
most thoughtful & substantial response the book's yet received. -- There's
also articles on Raworth, Wilkinson, Gascoyne, MacNeice, & Paulin, plus a
thoughtful introduction by Ward written shortly after Sep 11th.

all best --N

Hi,

    I think Two Girl Review is defunct as I got my check sent back when
I tried to order a sample copy about a year ago.

Poetry Society evicted from its website to sell Viagra not verse=20
Paul Kelso
Thursday March 21, 2002
The Guardian

"As I was trawling on the net, I found my site I couldn't get. I
couldn't get it again today, why has my website gone away?"=20

With apologies to Hughes Mearn, the Poetry Society could be forgiven for
adapting his verse after its website became the victim of a curious case
of cyber-squatting.=20

The society's award-winning website (www.poetrysoc.com) was until last
week a rare literary success in cyberspace, attracting 300,000 hits a
month. But last Thursday visitors found the site had gone from verse to
bad.=20

Instead of the usual selection of new poetry and educational
initiatives, they found a directory of online services ranging from
internet casinos to hair loss treatment and viagra distributors.=20

This was more than a technical problem. Thanks to an administrative
lapse, the Poetry Society - or its internet service provider, Total Web
Solutions - had not renewed its registration of the domain name,
allowing Ultimate Search Inc, a Hong Kong based company, to purchase it
and become the legal owners.=20

Why a search directory registered to a PO box in Hong Kong should want a
domain name that Andrew Motion and Roger McGough count among their
bookmarks is not clear, but their actions are beyond a joke for the
society.=20

As well as losing its main point of contact with the public, the
society's email is being sent to a server in Hong Kong.=20

On Monday it had to reprint 32,000 leaflets with a new web address
(www.poetrysociety.org.uk) which it hopes will go live today, and the
saga could cost the society, a registered charity sustained by the Arts
Council and 3,500 members, up to =A320,000 in legal fees.=20

Ultimate Search Inc has not replied to emails and telephone calls from
lawyers acting for the Poetry Society, and yesterday did not respond to
a message left by the Guardian.=20

"We've spent five years building up our award winning website and it's
pretty devastating to have the name taken over like this," said
Christina Patterson, director of the Poetry Society.=20

"We were getting 300,000 hits a month. It seems remarkable that a
company promoting gambling and viagra should use the name of a charity
set up to promote poetry."=20

Jane Mutimear, a lawyer at Bird & Bird which is acting for the society,
said it faced a long and expensive process to regain the rights to the
domain name.=20

"They thought they had renewed the domain name but that didn't happen,
and some- one else now owns a domain that has a strong association with
another organisation.=20

"There are several options. You can deal direct with the new owner and
hope they are reasonable and get it back through negotiations.=20

"The next option is to go to arbitration, which can take a lot of time
and does not provide financial recompense. Ultimate Solutions Inc have
been involved in these sorts of things before, and have won all
arbitration cases."=20

As the lawyers go to work, the Poetry Society faces huge debts as a
result.=20

"We will have to reprint our stationery, and restart school
initiatives," said Ms Patterson.=20

"We were hoping to make our first ever surplus this year of around
=A31,500, but I think this going to cost us =A320,000."

THE CANADA COUNCIL'S SPOKEN AND ELECTRONIC WORDS PROGRAM

An interview by Jim Andrews with Paul Seesaquasis, Writing and Publishing Section Officer of the
Canada Council. The interview outlines the Canada Council's Spoken and Electronic Words program
that awards grants to Canadian artists and encourages them to apply.


ANDREWS:
What is the Spoken and Electronic Words program at the Canada Council, Paul?

SEESAQUASIS:
It's a relatively new program - in existence since 1999 - that supports innovative literary
projects that are not based on conventional book or magazine formats. This is a diverse
program - eligible projects include literary performance, rap poetry, storytelling and poetry
videos - as well as digital literary creation such as web sites and CD-ROMs. To apply to the
program an artist needs to be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada; the program
does support collaborative projects between, say, a Canadian artist and an American, as long as
the application comes from the Canadian artist.

Grant amounts range from $1,000 to $20,000 and are for creation, production, performance, or
dissemination of the literary creation. It is an annual program, meaning it has one deadline per
year - June 01, 2002 is the next - and applications are downloadable off the Canada Council web
site (http://canadacouncil.ca). Applications to the Spoken and Electronic Words program are
submitted to a peer assessment committee comprised of spoken and electronic word artists who are
not applying. Based upon their assessment of each project and the budget available, grants are
awarded. The success rate is roughly one in four applications.

I should also mention that for digital literary projects, priority is given to projects that
involve literary innovation and a creative use of the medium.

If an artist is interested in applying to the program, I suggest they call me (or Carole Boucher
for French language projects). As a program officer I am here to answer questions regarding the
program. My number at the Canada Council is 1-800-263-5588, ext. 5482 or e-mail at
paul.seesequasis@canadacouncil.ca

ANDREWS:
Electronic and spoken word projects tend to be very different from one another. Does the same
jury work on both types of projects?

SEESAQUASIS:
There is quite a difference between spoken word projects and electronic words projects. Spoken
Word projects are most often focussed on literary performance or recording literary work onto CD
or CD-ROM. In contrast, electronic words projects are digital in nature, have a high integration
of technology and art, and there is often an element of experimentation in them. For this
reason, in the English language competition, there are now seperate peer assessment committees
for electronic and spoken words.

ANDREWS:
What are the elements of a good proposal to your program? I realize that you have covered that,
to some extent, in what you've said above. But are there some general categories, including
things like a budget, proposed venues for the finished project, and other elements not directly
concerning the nature of the work itself, that are important?

And how about the discussion in the proposal of the work itself--what sort of topics should be
addressed? I think a lot of artists lack a sense of what a good proposal should cover.

SEESAQUASIS:
Describe what you want to do. Present your plan in such a way that someone who has never heard
of you can understand your vision. Pass it on to a friend for a read and listen to your friend -
if something doesn't make sense to him or her, it likely won't make sense to the jury (peer
assessment committee). Write about how you intend to organize your time to carry out the
project. Present your plan clearly and succinctly, allowing the peer assessment committee to
grasp the nature, intent and relevance of your project in relation to your artistic approach.
State what you will accomplish with the grant. Remember, you are writing for artists who work in
electronic literature.

The peer assessment committees appreciate clear and concise résumés. List the locations and
dates of a) your art training (professional experience, university, college, or workshops,
etc.), and b) your professional public presentations (exhibitions, screenings, publications,
etc.). Clearly indicate the relevant information for the digital works that you have created in
your professional (non-student) art practice. You may wish to include other activities relevant
to your artistic practice, or activities that demonstrate the recognition of your peers. Make
sure your résumé does not exceed three pages, and that the most recent activities are listed
first. Remember that information that does not relate to your career as an artist is not
required.

The support material you should submit should reflect the nature of your artistic work. Insure
that you have clearly indentified what you want to be seen - for instance, if it a web site,
include a path of direction so that the peer assessment committee sees exactly what you want
them to see. Also, if at all possible, enclose a copy of your site on CD-ROM - in case your site
happens to be down on the day of the jury. Remember that the peer assessment committees have a
limited time in which to study each grant application so don't expect them to spend hours
searching through your work.

Your budget should be clear as to what expenses you are requesting and those items should be
necessary to complete your project. Subsistence costs are fine but cannot exceed $2000 per
month. You do not need to include quotes or receipts, but remember that the peer assessment
committee will have experience in costing so your numbers should be accurate. Purchases of
software or other items must be absolutely necessary for your work. Do not expect the peer
assessment committee to support "buying a new computer" or something that vague. Finally, if you
have other sources of revenue - including in-kind, donations or coporate/private/public support
do include that in your budget.

ANDREWS:
I imagine that some people might tend to put in great proposals but when you compare the
proposal with the previous work, they don't fit together? Does that happen much?

SEESAQUASIS:
Yes it does happen. It's important to be realistic in your project and impress upon the peer
assessment committee that you are fully capable of fulfilling your goals. Your previous work
should inspire confidence in the committee that your work is capable of progressing to the stage
that you are proposing. A "great leap forward" may be met with skepticism by the committee. And,
as always, bear in mind that the electronic word competition is very competitive so put your
best foot forward, so to speak, but do not try and do a long jump.

ANDREWS:
Yet the Electronic and Spoken Word program puts an emphasis on innovation. So that's a tough
one, because if you're going to be innovative, that requires a long jump, so that unless you
have a history of innovation, or have gone very far over a few years, it would be natural for a
jury to be skeptical that you are going to do it now. In such case, I suppose there are various
ways to support one's claims. Like if you're in mid air, send a photo?

SEESAQUASIS:
A good point. If you are in mid-air show it. In the end it may not turn out exactly as you
envisioned but you can show, at least, that you have done the training to get there. The program
welcomes innovation but there are two important points you need to convey to the committee. The
first is your project desciption and that you have a clear idea of your project and are able to
explain clearly and, ideally, excite the committee about it. Also, if you have a demo or
prototype or whatever you want to call it ready to show then the committee gets a better sense
of what the end result may be.

ANDREWS:
Thanks, Paul.

Hiya Arielle etal, I think two girls review did their last issue quite a few
years ago, unless I am mistaken. I was in what I think is the last issue,
after a 2 year wait to hear and then a 2 year wait/wonder for it to appear,
if I am remembering correctly. Have been having the same wait (as you I
mean) for Big Allis, and also for Raddle Moon. Any word about those?
My love to busy editors everywhere,

Mona Lisa Goes Online in Louvre Web Site Revamp

By Rebecca Harrison
Reuters

PARIS (March 22) - Paris's Louvre is revamping its Web site so art lovers can
view its entire collection, including thousands of drawings unseen by museum
visitors, without ever setting foot in France.

The Louvre Web site already displays some of the museum's exhibits and gets
six million visits a year, as many as flock to the French capital to see
Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'' and other famous works up close.

All 35,000 of its exhibits will be on show at the revamped site announced on
Friday. Directors hope the upgrade will give more people across the globe
access to the world's biggest museum.

Online visitors will also be able to see a further 130,000 drawings, which
are too fragile for public display and can only be seen by appointment.

From next year visitors to the site, almost half of whom are currently North
Americans, will be able to see the huge collection in a virtual,
three-dimensional tour of the museum's galleries.

''This way the entire Louvre collection will be accessible to everyone,''
Internet Director Catherine Jaques told Reuters after a presentation of the
site, adding the plan was to make the Louvre ''the world's biggest virtual
museum.''

The 165,000 works will be online by 2003, before the museum launches the
second phase of the revamp, aimed at enabling websurfers to create their own
personalized Louvre Internet service, Jaques said.

''It will be a case of 'My Louvre' -- so if somebody is a big Mona Lisa fan
they will receive information about the Mona Lisa,'' she said.

And those who make it to France's most visited cultural site will eventually
be able to immortalize their visit by downloading information from portable
audioguides onto handheld computers or third generation mobile telephones.

Museum chiefs hope the new site will push hits up to between 10 and 15
million per year by 2010.

edited a dossier of new American writing in French for Java, and co-edited
the following collections of French poetry translated by American poets:
with Chet Wiener, Christophe Tarkos: Ma Langue est Po=E9tique--Selected Work
(New York: Roof) 2001; with Norma Cole, Twenty-two New (to North America)

teaching history in a grammar school, he worked as a substitute fare
collector at highway toll booths.  He has collaborated with a number of
contemporary French writers, artists, and composers, including Katalin
Moln=E1r, Pascal Doury, and Eryck Abecassis.  He has presented perhaps a
record number of poetry readings, improvisations and performances, touring
51 European cities in 1999 alone.

Alferi (Yale Book of Twentieth- Century Poetry, 2002), F=E9lix Guattari (Soft
Subversions, with David Sweet, Semiotext(e) 1996; Chaosophy, with David
Sweet, et al., Semiotext(e) 1995 ), and Agn=E8s Rouzier, Cyb=E8le Lhermite and
Albane Prouvost in reviews. His poetry in English has appeared in Crayon,
Epoch, Object, Torque and elsewhere, as well as in the Biennale
Internationale des Po=E8tes en Val-de-Marne (1996, translated by Emmanuel
Hocquard), and in French in Java and if. In 1999 his WalkDontWalk was
published at Potes and Poets, after having been translated into French as
Marchez ne courez pas (Cr=E9aphis, 1998, Anne Talvas, et al.). He currently
lives in Paris where he researches topics in sixteenth-century French
literature and philosophy, is engaged in a photographic project on
construction sites and the airport, and works as a professional translator.

A couple of things in response to Richard - first, it's not bemoaning a
zeitgeist of every generation - I don't believe so much in cyclicity as in
exponentiality corrupted by (stochastic) chaos - things are reaching edges
and lips we couldn't have dreamed of a generation or two ago. The verge is
frightening. One only has to look at things such as rates of flora/fauna
extinctions, air pollution, dissemination of weapons, etc.

For me this is also coupled with a propensity towards depression - and a
deeper feeling that depression is also a certain kind of truth (I'm think-
ing of Kristeva's writing in Black Sun here). I fight off the depression
as best I can, but not the truth, such as it is. (Note the qualifiers.) On
the other hand, I'm fairly outspoken politically here, which may or may
not get me into trouble. -

It's not a question of giving up, but of developing the inertial impulse
to continue.

Of course I'm only speaking for myself.

Hi Everyone,

I'm going to be in Cleveland for a couple of days in mid-April, getting
visual reference material for a d.a.levy comic book. Are there Cleveland
people on this list? Anyone who can maybe help tell me how (without a car)
to best get from for instance the Flats to the Historical Society to 115th &
Euclid to the Old Arcade, etc., etc.? I'm doing Google searches and Yahoo
Maps searches and so on, so I'm not completely in the dark about where stuff
is ... but could definitely use some help figuring out the public transit
system there, etc.
Help! Please backchannel: gpsullivan@hotmail.com

Many kind thanks in advance,

Gary

Seems to me an internet space-provider should be
allowed to rent space for a domain, and throw a non-paying tenant off his
space, but not charge for a domain-name, which a person or group ought by
law to be able to purchase permanently.  But I certainly don't know much
about it.

In this case, I would suggest that all those who go to the Poetry Society
and find crap-ads send five or ten e.mails
to Universal Solutions a day and any other legal thing they
can think of to express their disgust with Universal Solutions' piracy.

After being withheld from circulation for 17 years, all six of Guy Debord's
films were screened at the 2001 Venice Film Festival and it was announced
that they would all be made generally available again in spring 2002. The
opening is now scheduled for April 9-11 in Paris.

Ken Knabb has been asked by Alice Debord to make a new English translation
of Debord's complete filmscripts. This translation will be used for
subtitling, and will also be published in book form. If all goes well it is
likely that subtitled versions of all the films will be available within the
next year or so.

Meanwhile, you can find out more about Debord's films at:

The Bureau of Public Secrets website features numerous texts by and about
Guy Debord and other members of the Situationist International, the
notorious avant-garde group that helped trigger the May 1968 revolt in

Unfortunately, messages sent to the list over the past few days were

Hoa Nguyen's Spring 2002 Virtual Poetry Workshop will begin on Thursday
April 4. For application guidelines, please write to the workshop leader
Hoa Nguyen at nguyenhoa@hotmail.com. (Please note that the workshop is
designed for people of high-school age).

To get an idea of how Hoa runs her workshop, check out the archived
workshops at http://www.writenet.org/virtualpoetrywrkshp.html.  It's
really a great (and free) opportunity for student writers to develop some
pretty radical ideas about the possibilities for poetry.

Dear List-

Well, it has been almost half a year since Puppy
Flowers first burst onto the glaring screens of
America’s technological consciousness.  Most, like
Brendan Lorber, were enamored by its "tough feminine
marvelousness and street swagger," while others, like
elder statesman Ron Padgett, were more struck by how
online journals tend to hurt one’s eyes.  So true, so
true.  Thanks to a committed and discerning sticker
campaign, Puppy Flowers has been spotted at bus stops
and in public restrooms all over the country.  Now, I
know what you’re thinking—-bus stops and public
bathrooms...that’s exactly when and where I want to
jump online and do a little literary surfing!—-great
minds think alike.

It is now my instinctual pup pleasure to announce the
Issue Two Release party!  In celebration of PF2, and
on the very night the new site goes up, many will
flock to, some merely gather at, Blue Books in San
Francisco for a shake-the-room blooming party.  The
reading will take place on Thursday, April 4th at 7:30
PM.  Readers will include Micah Ballard, kari edwards,
Chris Martin, Dave Bryant, Colin Guthrie, Christina
Fisher, and the esteemed Patrick James Dunagan.  Blue
Books is located at 766 Valencia St. in the Mission
and is otherwise known as the New College Cultural
Center.  Both MC's and refreshments will be served.

Hope to see you there,

Chris Martin
Poetry Editor of Puppy Flowers

+ DERVISH FLOWERS

"Dervish Flowers" is a shockwave work by French painter
Nicolas Clauss and composer Jean-Jaques Berge. Elegant and inventive, the =
piece responds to the mouse movements of viewers, putting dancers/flowers =
in motion. As the dancers are moved 'off-stage,' a new screen and new =
dancers replace them. =20

William Poundstone is the author of eight books--two of them, The =
Recursive Universe and Labyrinths of Reason, were nominated for the =
Pulitzer Prize.  Brian Kim Stefans writes: "What is most striking...is the =
easy dexterity with which Poundstone negotiates several different =
aesthetic traditions... not to mention the developing traditions of web =
art itself which he seemed instictively to know how to exploit to create =
an unmistakably 'literary' site that, nonetheless, would not have been =
done justice in a book."

Hi,

Does anyone know of writers using the index as a form?
Has listing as a technique been examined critically
anywhere? Thanks.

Many thanks to all who sent useful advice regarding
publishing on demand.

THE STATE

For California Poet Laureate, Names Both Large and Small
Culture: The field shrinks to three, each a strong contender. The final
choice should emerge in July.
By ROBIN FIELDS
TIMES STAFF WRITER

March 29 2002

The writing staff of TV's "Will & Grace" didn't make the cut.

Fifty-one more California wordsmiths ended up on the scrapheap too,
despite resumes gilded with prestigious awards, fellowships and
publications.

In the end, a Beat Generation standout, a bilingual chronicler of
Chicano life and a multimedia Renaissance man emerged Wednesday as the
finalists to become California's first formally chosen poet laureate.
Now it falls to Gov. Gray Davis to nominate Diane di Prima, Francisco
Alarcon or Quincy Troupe to a post that has existed since 1915 but was
largely political until last year, when the Legislature approved a
detailed set of qualifications and duties for it.

The multitiered process to pick a poet laureate initially produced a
rather muted response from California's literary community.

Several of the state's best-known poets declined to be nominated,
including Pulitzer Prize winners Gary Snyder and Philip Levine, former
U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Hass and Bay Area legend Lawrence
Ferlinghetti. A few days before the Feb. 19 deadline, the council had
received just 10 submissions.

But a last-minute blast of publicity brought a cascade of 45 more
applications, some from unexpected quarters. The 11-member "Will &
Grace" writing staff, for example, submitted itself for the job.

"We are the poets of the Southern California landscape," said Jeff
Greenstein, one of the show's executive producers.

Their entry didn't survive the first judging round, which culled the
applicant pile from 55 to 21.

"Maybe if the writers of 'Six Feet Under' had been nominated," quipped
panelist Jack Hicks, a professor at UC Davis.

"Well that's just mean," Greenstein shot back. "No one ever takes comedy
seriously."

A five-member panel convened Wednesday in Sacramento to pick three
finalists, looking for poets with national stature and the ability to
act as ambassadors for their craft.

In Troupe, Alarcon and Di Prima, they chose starkly different stylists,
all with proven ability to communicate across regional, generational and
ethnic lines.

Troupe, 59, may be as well-known for his radio show, "The Miles Davis
Project," and for the autobiography he penned with Davis, as for his
poetry. His electric performance style helped the La Jolla resident, who
also teaches at UC San Diego, win the heavyweight title twice at the
annual Taos Poetry Circus.

Alarcon, 48, who oversees the Spanish for Native Speakers program at UC
Davis, is one of the nation's most prominent Chicano poets. He has
written 10 volumes of poetry, including "Snake Poems," which won the
1993 American Book Award, and an acclaimed children's book.

Di Prima, 67, born in Brooklyn but a longtime San Francisco fixture,
captured the Beatnik era, both in poems and autobiographical writing,
and by editing several poetry anthologies. She co-founded "The Floating
Bear," a periodical that featured works by William S. Burroughs and Jack
Kerouac, and has written numerous plays.

"It is a great honor to be considered," Di Prima said. "California is my
country, in a way. How we see the world is unique."

The governor is expected to pick from among the finalists by July,
sending one name for confirmation by the state Senate. The winner will
serve no more than two two-year terms, during which he or she must give
public readings and take on a project.

Di Prima said she would use the position to reach out to working people,
urging them to write based on their experiences. Greenstein said the
"Will & Grace" staff would have brought an episode of the New York-based
show to California.

"Maybe that's California's loss," he said.

OK My take - retake - is that yes "depression" is reality: as are the way we
perceive he egative aspects eg of technology misapplied and so on. The
reality of course is how one/we feel. The actual state of the world may e
quite at variance: but a writer is never untruthful unles he is "lying"
inwhich case he/she's telling the truth because he/she intended to lie wich
is what he she is saying. A kind of phenomemological viewpoint.
   In myself I choose to happiness most times: that the world is polluted,
dying out (possibly), has a lot of injustice is, in my opinion, just too
bad: we cant do much about it  (a simple example: whether one supports the
Republicans or not intheir wonderful attack on "The Evil Ones" is probably
irrelevant: it will be a class-political-psych-existential choice: none of
it either way wil lsee the world significantly changed) and also poetry
doesnt do anything (or am I wong?)...yet it gives a great amount of pleasure
and richnesss....in a way Ed Dorn made an effort though: that kind of
writing has a "point" but after a while, one thinks, how productive is all
this darkness for me: I need the dark AND the light. I think all artists,
all beings probably, need those....I dont even watch the news much these
days: there's not much one can do about the "bad" things except moan: we
need more happy people.....But: a bit of dark, a bit of light... Cheers,
Richard.
