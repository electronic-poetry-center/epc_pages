i'd vote for Leonard Nimoy to get his own stamp -
i mean i know he's not dead but since Star Trek
went off the air he might as well be

ever read his book of poetry - "Thinking of you"
i think its called - my vote for the worse book
of poetry ever written

of course i have a copy! i figure anyone can
write a bad poem - but it takes a special skill
to write a real stinker - kinda like Whitman
'cept Whitman at his best was better'n anybody
and even at his worst was still like no one else

how about John Cage?

i'm ashamed to admit i've never read mckuen -
they got em by the armful down at the local used
bookstore - so i think i'll check em out

and on a side note -
i've been reading Harold Bloom lately and was
wondering if he had written a page that didn't
have the word "belated" "swerve" or "clinamen"
anywhere on it

just curious

(this goes largely to Cybermind/Cyberculture/Wryting but might be of
interest here as well, send out once every few months. and apologies for
cross-posting.)



Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                           April 001


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the work; readers
may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing may appear
fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent whole. On my
end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists, partial or
transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 100 files, or 4500 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and has continued as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and Nikuko, in parti-
cular.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death, sex,
virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, com-
puter languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the text; the
resulting splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, program-
ming, deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the
domains of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions, relative to philosophical concerns. I continue working on a cdrom
of the last seven years of my work (Archive); I also have additional video
materials, created with Azure Carter and Foofwa d'Imobilite, on two
cdroms, Baal and Parables. Most recently, I've been working on a text for
publication, ".echo" and I've published articles on Stelarc and Panamar-
enko. I've also been at work on a cdrom called Asteroids, with 3d modeling
of virtual organs used for fly-byes. And I want to write once again on
radio and radiations.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

It may be difficult to enter the texts for the first time. The Case of the
Real is a sustained work and possible introduction. It is also helpful to
read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (lq, lr)
as well. Skip around. The Index works only for the earlier files; you can
look up topics and then do a search on the file listed.

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

Current cdroms are available for $14; if you've have an earlier version,
they go for $10. (Video format is .mov with Sorenson compression or .avi
or .avi-jpg). (Costs include shipping.)

You can find my collaborative projects at
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and my conference
activities at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk - both as a result of my virtual
writer-in-residence with the Trace online writing community.

All Blue,

Please help to pass the word along that 2River has just moved to its own

        http://www.2River.org

The old location

        http://www.daemen.edu/~2River

over the next few weeks will gradually disappear.

Since 1996, 2River has been an online site of poetry, art, and theory,
quarterly publishing The 2River View and occasionally publishing individual
authors in the 2River Chapbook Series.

        his lots by prophesying a
        future        metropolis.

No longer does it need to attract attention by the use of such phrases as

Apropos the remarks of Jacques Debrot and Andrew Felsinger on this thread
Alison Croggon has asked that the following, as sent to the British Poets
Mailing List on the 30th March,  be forwarded to this list.

David Bircumshaw



Sorry to bore you all - the VeRT was announced before I could append my
own short intro (things here are somewhat pressed).  The editors are
publishing the original and altered emails from me only - they claim that
this is sufficient.  I see that no other of the Britpo objections, most
especially Trevor's, are being given air.  Nor is there an apology
anywhere that I can see.  What puzzles me most of all about this is why
anyone else would be remotely interested.

However.  For the record, as they say, here's my intro to my altered
comments.

Best

A

I hope these posts stand on their own.  They were written for a mailing
list, without the intention of publication or further consideration
outside the particular context in which they were written.

When Kent Johnson submitted his Lacan dialogues to VeRT, he also
submitted, without permission and in violation of copyright, a selection
of emails from British-poets members to this magazine.  British Poets
members objected because the emails were presented as if they were a fair
representation of what had been originally written, when in fact many of
them had been greatly altered, sometimes to mean the exact opposite of
what had been originally said.  The editors assert that "the posts had,
indeed, been edited-- though not materially changed": this is in fact not
true.  Each one of my own posts either been misleadingly cut, or had been
rewritten, or had parts added which I did not write.  I hope this
comparison makes clear how they were changed, and for what reason.

I was angered by these changes, which seemed to me extraordinarily
dishonest and, to say the least, self-aggrandising.  I still fail to see
the relevance of publishing the British Poets posts to the original work:
despite all Kent's claims, the Lacan dialogues created no especial
scandal, apart from boring a number of people witless by turning up as
regularly as spam.  I have no doubt they are better served by being
published in their current form, where they can be accessed voluntarily
by those interested.

The editors have agreed to publish the original and altered emails side
by side, so that anyone interested in this minor spat can make up their
own minds.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"

I'd like to invite you to check out a new piece of Web art:

NIO:
http://www.turbulence.org/Works/Nio/

*interactive music
*visual/sound poem
*suggestive of a new form of music/multimedia
*hopefully a popular alternative to the music video

Also part of the project:
*Interview by Randy Adams (text)
*'Nio and the Art of Interactive Audio' (essay)
*'Technotes on Nio and Audio Programming with Director 8' (essay)
*visual poems made from onion skins of the Nio animations (bitmaps)

I did the vocals, the programming, the animations, the graphics, the works.
Took me several months. Hardest but funnest Web piece I've done so far.

There are several more in the works. The underlying software (written in
Lingo) synchronizes layers and sequences of audio. It also synchronizes the
animations with the audio. Also, just as the audio is layered, so too are
the animations. You interactively construct layers and sequences of the
available sounds, and each sound is associated with an animation that plays
when the sound plays. So Nio suggests a new form of music, really, which is
interactive and conjoined with the visual. Although Nio is primarily a
writerly/poetical realization of such visual music (Vismu) you can see that
with a different approach to the animations and more sounds, the form itself
is quite a radical alternative to the music video. And there are many other
juicy possibilities discussed in the essays.

There are two essays: 'Nio and the Art of Interactive Audio for the Web'
discusses the artistic, technological, and business possibilities in the
work I'm developing. The second is a 'how to' essay on audio programming
with Macromedia Director 8.

Nio is a commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc. for its
Turbulence.org web site with funds from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Hope you like it.

I realize it a little absurd to perpetuate the Rod thread, but less so =
if it
becomes something in excess of smirk fest. I think Rod is about the =
"total
experience" of ambient light, music and the immersive parfumerie of =
snarky
self-invention. Compare Jimmy Webb's "film operas", Mick Ronson's =
"Slaughter
on 10th Ave", or Chicago's love guru Bobby Conn. In each case failure =
and
fantasia are of a species, and "love" is spectacle, is accident, is
disastrous, is worth singing about. I think pushing it too far is part =
of
the point, and why the fan's collusion is so satisfying. It's =
transformative
risk, it's about being light-hearted in the most serious way, and about
comic participation of the sort that J. Debrot is so often writing =
about.

Brathwaite, Louis Zukofsky, and on the Black avant-garde.  His poetry was
included in the special issue of Callaloo on "Emerging Male Writers"
(1998).  Mr. McMorris lives in Washington, DC, and teaches at Georgetown
University.

ELIZABETH WILLIS's collection The Human Abstract (Penguin, 1995)  won the
National Poetry Series in 1994.  She is also the author of several
chapbooks, a book-length poem entitled Second Law (Avenue B, 1993), and a
new manuscript entitled Turneresque.  Her work "picks up on a line of
'generative orders' of visionary poetry and leads the reader to an
uncharted place, speaking of and to a new generation of American writers"
(Lisa Jarnot, Poetry Project Newsletter).  Currently she is Writer in
Residence at Mills College in Oakland, and lives in Santa Cruz.

"For people in the Caribbean and for the people who have left, the region
sometimes acquires the compelling form of an origin.  Behind this origin
lies other beginnings, other identities and other cultural practices.
Poetry involves itself in the New Place with the speech in continuous
evolution, with perceptions marked in contrast to absence, to earlier
presences, and with relationships that never cease to be aware of initial
causes.  In this way, a poetry of Caribbean origin is one that registers
the accents of multiple geographies in the formation of persons.  No ground
exists to celebrate the homecoming of such a speech.  The false grounds of
identity surface in the language and maintain their willingness to define
definitively the incompleteness of the name without the sanction of various
centres."
--Mark McMorris, from "Poetry of Implication"
(preface to "Out of the Anglophone Caribbean," Exact Change Yearbook)

"[Elizabeth] Willis insists upon the uniqueness of everything; and she
succeeds, with amazing consistency, in reinvesting language with the
uniqueness of origin."
--Joshua McKinney, Denver Quarterly

I realize it a little absurd to perpetuate the Rod thread, but less so if it
becomes something in excess of smirk fest. I think Rod is about the "total
experience" of ambient light, music and the immersive parfumerie of snarky
self-invention. Compare Jimmy Webb's "film operas", Mick Ronson's "Slaughter
on 10th Ave", or Chicago's love guru Bobby Conn. In each case failure and
fantasia are of a species, and "love" is spectacle, is accident, is
disastrous, is worth singing about. I think pushing it too far is part of
the point, and why the fan's collusion is so satisfying. It's transformative
risk, it's about being light-hearted in the most serious way, and about
comic participation of the sort that J. Debrot is so often writing about.

But should anyone try to comfortably sideline the question of McKuen's
poetic project by accepting Kasey's example, then let me offer another from
the same site. It's a bit uneven, but not without its surprises and a few
idées de scène echoic of late Ashbery.

*****

"a message from the bunker"    (Rod McKuen)


It was not meant to be an odyssey,
Leviathan escape. Some unravel
time is all, to add a wing but not
rebuild the nest. A few fortnights
of coming down from drafty stages,
scary plains, aging airplanes. Too
many mornings waking in The
Grand and Not So Grand
Hotel Where Am I.

It should have been poco
divertimento from the second
act, intermission from the dead
line, time lapse from whatever.
A never time to reason out,
or out run reason. But lazy
months not monitored will
prance and promenade to
years. This easy conga line
may then go on a few more
eons 'til the fickle decades
whirl away with other partners
to the next slam dance event.

To some I had an easy death
out there in a poppy field. Or I
rolled over with some handsome
woman, or some pretty man until
we both rolled off the last horizon.
The truth was not so lovely but
we'll never know it you and me.
Every question does not need
A fancy dancer answer man.

Thank you for waiting. Guess I
knew you would. Others took up
Others to help them hoist their
banners. Glad they did. Well
they should. I've come back to
help you shoulder our old flags
and unfurl our new devices. Guess
you knew I would. Your graying
minstrel boy who hangs about
till all the lights go out Your Johnny
Jump Up Appleseed a-planting,
spring or not so spring is here
and home again. Harvest time
will have to wait till harvest time.

Have you seen my old partners,
tea dance mates, from all those
odd cotillions, boogie bar affairs?
Should you, tell them I'll be there
In all the new pavilions with a
pencil ready and my decade dance
card not yet filled with fox trot
promises and leisure dates.

Hello in there. We will rendezvous
Again. Guess you know we will.

John. In NZ you come across, or I used to come across, certain "characters"
in the work force that say are accounts clerks or whatever, but they studied
some Latin once and so on, and its their little joke...carborundum is the
stuff used ( a form of carbon) instead of diamonds for grinding etc...its
Zukovskic translation is: "Dont let the bastards grind ya down!"  Cheers,
Richard. PS another one my father used to say "gestucken" a kind of "German"
for stuck Again, his little joke, he was a Londoner but didnt know much if
any German.

Dear Spo(c)kers. Please keep it clean. Mr Harold Bloom, vastly prolific
author of innumerable stars on the milky way tomes whose number is and are
numberless, is surely an enormous asset to the United States. After all, how
many United Statsian criticators
(or Canadian for that matter) have starred in such epics as "Ulysses" by
that great Irish gourmet and fabulator James van Joyce? Hast thou not
realisethed that Ireland is now Joyceless?  Its because its lost its Bloom.
The Bloom(s) passed over to the US where one of the son's of the Blooms
became the worlds greatest reader. Bloom has read
8990008898989898098989889898 milllllllliooooonnnnn boooooookkkkkkkkkssssss.
Bloom infact...well, he went boom! "BOOOM!!"
  Actually, I'm reading some essays currently in the one he editied (with
about 600 milliion others in the series) about "The Sound & the Fury". Our
friend Harold claims its a bit too derivative of Joyce...well...but the
point is (seriously now) that Faulkner took Joyce's technique quite a number
of steps further with "The Sound and the Fury".  But, that said, and despite
that he critiqued J A's "Tennis Court Oath", Mr Bloom is an asset to
America. His blood should (nay must) be bottled.  He should be on many
stamps. A kind of jazzed up Leavis...but a worthy fellow, a worthy fellow:
despite all those long words like "liminal". Anycase...how could he avoid
"swerve". I had swerve the other day. One either veers or swerves or sheers
away in vertiginous something or rather until one fraginates the ansgt of
driven derisial derivation until in a huge unmitigated swoop the hybrid
Classist-Freydian-Wagnarian-Duino Elegies-Love Ya Baby-Miltonic
tonic-Trilling-Olsonian/Cagean(lake of silence)-Pinter-St John-Logosian and
new old-high cherishing traditionis be invoked. Of course one does. Eros.
Any way, if this stamp deathbate takes the wrong directianation, I will be
forced to fire you all out of my bloomin' canon. In fact I'll baballooooom
you out, bless me if I dont, to be sure.Yours, R.H.B.T.

Hi Richard,

From where you are coming from you are absolutely correct. However, I can
see where this crap is coming from. Its not as bad as I thought and hammers
out a highly lyrical patterned line, which has a high degree of difficulty
to sustain, as you know. I think we would agree on what makes for good
poetry and as a younger student of poetry I am still in that phase of
opening  myself to a wider spectrum than those I revere and emulate. I love
Creeley's tender lines but would rather chew tin foil than write like him;
I prefer Olson and Pound. But this is who I am and how I express the world I
see. I ask, seriously, could American poetry be what it is if Olsen was
without Creeley? One informs the other, I guess. I don't know why this guy
got a book contract or is sitting where he is. Well I do really, a bad poem
carries more weight than a good poem. I still don't understand how Irvine
Feldman got a Macarthur fellowship... or why people fixate on Frost ... it's
a mystery to me. However, to sum up my point: I see and feel the theme is
crap but its top quality crap. I hope you can accept that as a qualifier.


Best Geoffrey

My Distinction


I have difficulty with distinctions. I have read and written on emergence
and submergence, and understand the complexity of subsumption architecture
and its relation to complexity. I also have some idea about neural nets
and fluidity - and fluidity gathering in and through what might be called
intensifications or nodes. So at least on a metaphoric level I understand
simplicity functioning in complexity, rather than complexity functioning
in simplicity, or at the least, the intertwining of the two. I also think
of exchange value leading to semi-autonomous superstructural entities, ok?
So that language and its tethering occur only within a problematic. In the
meantime, I observe Jean-Paul the crayfish in our large aquarium - a cray-
fish has ten legs (decapod), several antennae, swimmerets, and various
other organs, all of which contribute to locomotion, defense, perception,
nourishment, reproduction, and so forth. A vast array connected by ganglia
and a small brain.

>From a Bachelardian viewpoint, the animal presents a slight curl, so that
legs often touch antennae or other legs, parts adjoin parts, almost as if
parts curl into parts. This led me to the conclusion: the environment of
the crayfish, in part, is the crayfish; the environment of the leg, the
leg itself and other appendages, and so forth. In this manner, subsumption
begins at home, extends outward; the crayfish is part of its environment
in a very literal way, as if the animal were to some extent disconnected
with itself. Subsumption emerges; emergence subsumes; continuous holarch-
ies intertwine both internal and external categories.

It climbs to the top of a rock repeatedly where it is highly vulnerable.
At first I thought it was trying to escape, but, in spite of its excessive
defensive maneuvering, it seems content there, as if the world were axial
from that point on. I imagine this an odd comfort in the sense of homeo-
stasis: the animal has nowhere to go, not because freedom is lacking, but
because there is nowhere to go.

I imagine at this conjunction of concavity/curl and rock/top (the highest
point in the aquarium within the walls) that the crayfish Jean-Paul is
'in' relative perfection; that its state is meditative; that it has, on
its own, accomplished both the transvaluation of all values and their
inextricable dialectical mingling, to such an extent that categories no
longer exist - by virtue of the disappearance of the symbolic itself. And
I note with that disappearance, the wavering of the indexical, the use-
lessness of the ikonic, the absurdities of proper names, languages, and
entities. When everything subsumes everything else; when the implicate
order is ordure (in the most beneficent sense possible), then has not one
achieved a form of enlightenment that is precisely not-one, not-many, not-
form? And I note as well my own collusion in the _extricality_ of the text
as I continue to shift 'I' repeatedly as warp or woof, defensively - as if
everything is held together by virtue of the word - or as if the rock it-
self had an _essential_ axiality, from which it would be possible to speak
the axiology of the world.

** NOTICE **** NOTICE **** NOTICE **** NOTICE **

The NY Times OP/ED Page for Tuesday April 3, 2001 will include a piece by
poet Ammiel Alcalay featuring The Poetry Center's American Poetry Archives
among other taped collections of poetry, focusing on preservation of these
archives' fragile taped materials.   In light of the annual national
celebration of American Poetry Month during April, the article remarks
efforts by several U.S. literary arts organizations to preserve rare taped
recordings of contemporary writers, the precarious nature of recorded
media, and our on-going climate of sustenance-level funding for the
literary arts.

Mr. Alcalay visited the Archives here at San Francisco State University
last month, when he and Bosnian poet Semezdin Mehmedinovic' (whose work
Alcalay has translated:  Sarajevo Blues, City Lights Books, 1998) read and
discussed their work for the Poetry Center.  Videotapes of their public
conversation at The Poetry Center, and their evening reading to a full
house at the Unitarian Center in San Francisco, join the American Poetry
Archives' vast video collection of contemporary writers that extends from
1973, when Kathleen Fraser rescued rare early audiotapes from being thrown
out and founded the American Poetry Archives.  Audiotapes in the Archives
collection date from 1954.

A printed catalog of Archives holdings available to the public will be
published later this year, with support from the National Endowment for the
Arts.  Currently, a partially completed list of Archives videotape holdings
can be accessed at our website:  www.sfsu.edu/~newlit

I don't know what to think of this except to say why is it being
discussed? It has vague echoes of all sorts of poetry , sort of
maudlin lyric, weak Williams, vague echoes of Down by the Sally Gar-
dens by Yeats;of course with Yeats, I mean in the Yeats poem, the
metrics are much superior, meaning tightly woven wheras this
one is vaguely formed around what suppoes itself tobe a half-rhyme
with too much repetition and variety; it possesses no irony as some
one else noted, but its lack of irony does not add to its interest,
but indeed its lack thereof makes its sustaining power
hard to imagine; any number of poems by Felicia Hemans holds out
much better; its disguised voice makes it improper to read. I mean its
dishonest and pretends to be 'sincere' but jack kerouac does
that much better and in plain style pain American English - I dont
even know why I am going on like this. Perhaps its because I dont
like my feelings being played with like this; but on the other hand
perhaps I do, indeed like to have the violins of sentimentality played, if
ruefully for  a moment

Ah, so much and so many popular poetryies etcetera/ It cld. make an
itneresting exercise to re-write it as material... blah blah...

I'm writing this post out of ignorance, despair, anger. I will confess
readily to the first, even the idiocy of it.

What the federal government is doing to the United States and the rest of
the world is horrifying. Most of the people I know, admittedly left-lean-
ing, feel powerless to stop it. Our own freedoms are being taken away; the
environment is left to rot; minorities are left out of any real decision-
making; and some of us, like myself, think we may be on the brink of war -
cold war, if not hot.

I've protested and sent protest emails, all with the understanding none of
this makes any difference. There are calls for boycotting US products, but
that will, I think, effect nothing; if Bush continues on his present path,
it's in subservience to the mining/oil/development interests at home -
which in fact would only be helped by boycotts. This country is one of the
largest, if not the largest, consumer per capita, of any country on the
planet - it also has, as you know the largest prison population (per capi-
ta as well), and next to no health care.

Bush, in order to get elected, made numerous campaign promises - many of
which he's reversed as soon as he took office. He promised compromise with
the Democrats, and has ignored them; he's reversed all environmental prom-
ises, etc. What he said in the campaign clearly makes no difference to
him. He's got Christie Whitman to act as his fall guy - and she seems in-
credibly liberal compared to him.

For the first time we have a "president" that has not been elected - we
are feeling the tension and horror of a government the people did not
want, and a government which clearly does not want the people. (Yes, there
have been electoral college reversals before, but not in modern times; not
with the collusion of the brother-governor of a state; and not with so
much right-wing legislation immediately put into place. Bush "lost" by
half a million, which is not inconsiderable, even by official counts, of
course.)

I am writing to ask the obvious - so it doesn't get kicked around only in
our lofts here - is anyone thinking of suing or impeaching Bush? Is such a
thing possible? Can a lawsuit be filed on the basis of campaign promises
immediately reversed? - which leads to the other natural question - Can I
promise _anything_ to get elected, and then proceed otherwise? I don't
know if constitutional law plays into this - I doubt it - but is there the
possibility of oral contracts established? I know this is the case among
private citizens here - very hard to prove - but with the government, this
would be a matter of record.

This country has never had, not since Vietnam, a strong and viable opposi-
tion; as you know, we have no speaker of the opposition here - and cur-
rently both congress and the supreme court side with right-wing concerns
in general. (While the Senate appears divided, Cheney casts the deciding
vote, and a number of Democrats are fairly right wing; the party has moved
more in that direction.) In short, on one hand there is intense economic/
laissez-faire capitalist activity, and on the other - silence, analysis,
theory, self-laceration, blame-placing, futile marches and email.

So many of us are living in despair; if the US continues on its ultra-
right path, the world economy and environment will suffer as well. We are
indeed a rogue nation, a violent one; we are a nation of murderes, killing
our own, taking the rest of the world for granted as marketplace, quaint,
tourist-destination, naive.

I'm well aware of the idiocy of this post, its naivete; I can repeatedly
analyze the current situation, but, again like many of us, "just" feel
victimized. I see no way out; I don't want to march and sign petitions
that mean nothing - no one is listening anymore.

Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Petitions, anyone?

this sentence is in a poem in which it's said that
 "crimson murder rushed the streets"
 this sentence reassures the reader that it is only a poem.
 this sentence states that the poem exaggerates, that nothing occurs,
  that one reads the poem like an audience.
  this sentence says: never take it seriously.

Greetings everyone!

Just thought I'd pass along the news that Heyday Books has just released HOW
MUCH EARTH: THE FRESNO POETS, an anthology containing poetry that has come
out of the amazingly vital and rich California Central Valley poetry scene.
It covers people like David St. John, Lawson Inada, Gary Soto, the late
Larry Levis and many, many more.  Gawd, it even contains a guy named Sam
Pereira who, while in his fifties, still thinks stanzas are gifts from da
gods, coupled with a bit of personal sweat.  Anyhow, if interested, check it
out at their web site:

     http://www.heydaybooks.com

and go to the CALIFORNIA POETRY SERIES link at that point.

Regards to all,

Sam

annabelle clippinger, and dana ward.

It also features two articles:
Aidan Thompson's "The Meaning of 'Meaning' in the 'Experimental' poetry of
Gertrude Stein, Lyn Heijinian, Rosmarie Waldrop, and Cole Swenson" and
Georgiy Bogin's "Metodological Problems of Understanding Good Literature."

As always, I am looking for submissions of poetry or poetic theory for the
next few issues.

Very nice! Have you ever read Douglas Hofstadter's Scientific American
article on self-reference? It's collected in his book Metamagical Themas and
is an abosolute must-read if you enjoy this sort of verbal magic. He provides
a quite indepth discussion of the history and mechanics of self-reference and
also quotes many delightful self-referential sentences. You should really try
to get your hands on the article sometime.

Alan,
Your work is getting eerier and more ironic (if that were possible). This
one truly feels like a commonplace "social activist" email, but subtly shows
itself to be a fiction.  Simple cues such as "if not hot" and the quotes
around "lost" in "Bush 'lost'"; the scores of warped statistics and "facts";
the many awkward word breaks (hyphenated as if printed), the seemingly
unselfconscious employment of cliches ("strong and viable opposition"); then
the masterstroke of suggesting impeachment on the basis of broken campaign
promises.  I have to say, it's good.  It has, how shall I say-- soft
lighting.  The American TV living room of the Twilight Zone 21st century.
The double sunset of democracy-- I love it.  Kudos.
-Aaron Belz

Okay, folks, get with the program.  It's Leigh Hunt's "Rondeau":

Jenny kissed me when we met,
        Jumping from the chair she sat in;
Time, you thief, who love to get
        Sweets into you list, put that in:
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,
        Say that health and wealth have missed me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,
        Jenny kissed me.

The McKuen strikes me as sort of a tumorous growth out of this minor, light,
and lovely squib.

With regard to other possible candidates for the poet stamp, who has heard
of or read Dell Hair, the "Policeman Poet"?  I found a copy of his _Nature
Beautiful Poems_ (1930) in a used book store when I was in New York a couple
weeks ago.  (Actually, I think there's supposed to be a colon after
"Beautiful," but that's the way it's printed on the cover.)  This guy, an
actual Toledo cop (or was it Topeka?  I forget), was a real eccentric.  The
poems are just the most unreadable doggerel, but apparently he was something
of a celebrity in his day, hailed as a "natural poet" who could compose
verse extempore on any and all occasions.  When he was hauling criminals
into the clink, he would recite (improvise?) poetry to them in the back of
the paddy wagon.  Hoo ha!

I'm writing this post out of ignorance, despair, anger. I will confess
readily to the first, even the idiocy of it.

What the federal government is doing to the United States and the rest of
the world is horrifying. Most of the people I know, admittedly left-lean-
ing, feel powerless to stop it. Our own freedoms are being taken away; the
environment is left to rot; minorities are left out of any real decision-
making; and some of us, like myself, think we may be on the brink of war -
cold war, if not hot.

I've protested and sent protest emails, all with the understanding none of
this makes any difference. There are calls for boycotting US products, but
that will, I think, effect nothing; if Bush continues on his present path,
it's in subservience to the mining/oil/development interests at home -
which in fact would only be helped by boycotts. This country is one of the
largest, if not the largest, consumer per capita, of any country on the
planet - it also has, as you know the largest prison population (per capi-
ta as well), and next to no health care.

Bush, in order to get elected, made numerous campaign promises - many of
which he's reversed as soon as he took office. He promised compromise with
the Democrats, and has ignored them; he's reversed all environmental prom-
ises, etc. What he said in the campaign clearly makes no difference to
him. He's got Christie Whitman to act as his fall guy - and she seems in-
credibly liberal compared to him.

For the first time we have a "president" that has not been elected - we
are feeling the tension and horror of a government the people did not
want, and a government which clearly does not want the people. (Yes, there
have been electoral college reversals before, but not in modern times; not
with the collusion of the brother-governor of a state; and not with so
much right-wing legislation immediately put into place. Bush "lost" by
half a million, which is not inconsiderable, even by official counts, of
course.)

I am writing to ask the obvious - so it doesn't get kicked around only in
our lofts here - is anyone thinking of suing or impeaching Bush? Is such a
thing possible? Can a lawsuit be filed on the basis of campaign promises
immediately reversed? - which leads to the other natural question - Can I
promise _anything_ to get elected, and then proceed otherwise? I don't
know if constitutional law plays into this - I doubt it - but is there the
possibility of oral contracts established? I know this is the case among
private citizens here - very hard to prove - but with the government, this
would be a matter of record.

This country has never had, not since Vietnam, a strong and viable opposi-
tion; as you know, we have no speaker of the opposition here - and cur-
rently both congress and the supreme court side with right-wing concerns
in general. (While the Senate appears divided, Cheney casts the deciding
vote, and a number of Democrats are fairly right wing; the party has moved
more in that direction.) In short, on one hand there is intense economic/
laissez-faire capitalist activity, and on the other - silence, analysis,
theory, self-laceration, blame-placing, futile marches and email.

So many of us are living in despair; if the US continues on its ultra-
right path, the world economy and environment will suffer as well. We are
indeed a rogue nation, a violent one; we are a nation of murderes, killing
our own, taking the rest of the world for granted as marketplace, quaint,
tourist-destination, naive.

I'm well aware of the idiocy of this post, its naivete; I can repeatedly
analyze the current situation, but, again like many of us, "just" feel
victimized. I see no way out; I don't want to march and sign petitions
that mean nothing - no one is listening anymore.

Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Petitions, anyone?

Alan

Alan. Dont worry about politics so much. Or at least dont let it get you
down yourself. I dont like Bush either from over here: he could well
precipitate another attack on China (as in the Vietnam fiasco)...the right
wing are behind him..who knows. But the injustices will always be there.
You're doing enough.  You as a poet are doing enough. An extraordinary
amount of brilliant work. Dont get down. Keep writing and living. Great
poetry.Keep the politics and the poetry (can the two be separated?)(I think
not mostly) going. These are serious times, but you're doing enough.  Thanks
for it. Yours sincerly, Richard.

 April 4, 2001                               A Fading Poetry                              By AMMIEL ALCALAY                                      The ancient Egyptians used stone and
parchment, whereas our collective                                     memory is often stored on acetate, vinyl
and emulsion-coated films -                                     forms that die quickly. Much of the
documentation of 20th century                             American poetry and literary culture is in
evanescent form, and it is being lost.                              On a bicoastal itinerary from New York to San
Francisco, with major stops in                             Boston, Boulder, Vancouver and Los Angeles, you
can find thousands of                             decaying reels of audiotape, film and videotape.
Three of the most important                             collections are at the Poetry Project in New York
City, the Jack Kerouac School                             of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in
Boulder, Colo., and the Poetry                             Archives at San Francisco State University.                              These materials have mainly to do with the New
American Poetry, which                             includes the Objectivists, the San Francisco
Renaissance, the Umbra and Black                             Arts movements, the Beats, Black Mountain and the
New York School. The                             texts of poets in these many movements are
reasonably accessible, as                             demonstrated by the magnificent 1998 New York
Public Library exhibition, "A                             Secret Location on the Lower East Side." But the
sights and sounds are fading                             fast.                              Before they disappear, you can still listen to
Langston Hughes (in 1958) praising                             Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti for
initiating poetry-and-jazz                             performances the year before, an audio moment
that neatly links the Harlem                             Renaissance, the San Francisco Renaissance and
the Beats; you can hear                             James Baldwin discuss his novel "Giovanni's Room"
with Philip Roth (in 1960).                             While the tape and film last, you can watch John
Cage persisting in a                             performance piece (about Henry David Thoreau) on
the night Richard Nixon                             resigned - as the audience, wanting to celebrate,
gets steadily wilder. You can                             see a San Francisco poetry reading for gay
liberation in 1971, or Allen Ginsberg                             in the basement at City Lights bookstore
discussing William Carlos Williams as                             Neal Cassady arrives. You might see young Alice
Walker discussing Zora Neale                             Hurston when the latter was still forgotten, the
former little known.                              Preservation of such materials is incredibly
labor-intensive. Repository                             institutions are doing their best to protect
their archives, but a greater                             commitment from public and private donors is
desperately needed. Because                             many of the films and tapes are by now quite
delicate, they must be re-recorded                             in real time, with someone monitoring the
process. Existing tapes may be too                             weak to endure more than the one playing needed
for transfer to masters.                              These materials are an invaluable legacy -
readings, classes, public                             discussions and other encounters with many of
America's most important                             writers of the past 50 years. Ideally, this
legacy should be made available to the                             public in the most accessible formats, much as
the Smithsonian Institution has                             preserved our musical heritage.                              Otherwise, we will have at best the corporate
version of, say, Jack Kerouac -                             the cropped, airbrushed Beat posing in khakis -
rather than the dense literary,                             poetic and social culture from which that photo
was lifted in the name of selling                             pants.                              Ammiel Alcalay is a poet and author of "Memories
of Our Future: Selected                             Essays, 1982-1999."

Nineteen Ways of Looking For Wang Wei
by Eliot Weinberger, Octavio Paz (Photographer)
(Paperback - June 1987)
Average Customer Review:
Out Of Stock, out of mind

5 of 5 poets found the following review helpful:
Very interesting, April 4, 2001
Reviewer: A reader from Hainan
This pilot is very valuable in the art of translation. It offers one Wang
Wei quatrain: in the original Chinese character, a literal translati Top
Secret essays as well. I enjoyed it immensely.


Nineteen Ways of Looking For Wang Wei

1. In the water. If he were "American" clipping Chinese spy plane, he would
be national hero. Heron, hibiscus; No pity the flowers fallen.

2. In the air. Double-U trying to look tough on camera; this ain't Granada,
sonny-boy.

3. In your heart. With State "state of the art" "eavesdropping" plane of
the heart. What will it reveal?

4. At the poetry workshop. Palindrome of china: anihc.

5. In the Rose Garden, by the new ballfield: they say he was a quite a
player back in the day.

6. On Napster: "sorry seems to be the hardest word."

7. At City Lights: "CIA Dope Calypso" and also "you don't really want to go
to war. . . it's them bad Russians. Them Russians them Russians and them
Chinamen."

8. On K-Tel records: Cold War hits of the 50s, 60s, 70s, etc. etc.

9. On the autmn hills hoarding scarlet from the setting sun; birds chasing,
etc. etc.

10. At the international trade board meeting, well-covered by the New York
Times: "China demands Washington overlook its human rights abuses in new
trade partnership or admit its own."

11. On death row in Texas: the ex-governor craves a celebratory beer while
making "quips."

12. On favorite Clash album: "ask the Dali Lama in the hills of Tibet/ How
many monks did the Chinese get?"

13. At Wal-Mart, banned: McVeigh to ghost write Wang Wei bio from beyond.

14. At the clinic for reproductive rights: Mr. Zhu said "This was plane
that penetrated without permission, violating law."

15. In everything Made in Most Favored Nation.

16. Don't blame me, I voted for INSERT CANDIDATE HERE.

17. "Nuts."

18. "How long can one man's lifetime last?/ In the end we return to
formlessness./ I think of you waiting to die. A thousand things cause me
distress" - the other Wang Wei, the one not flying jet fighter

19. your own way, own wang

I am trying to collect Elizabethan, Restoration and other period British
poetry in which the couplet, "come live with me and be my love/ and we will
some pleasures prove" appears.  It needn't be in first lines, as in
Donne.  So far, I have this material in Walton's Compleat Angler (anon.
attribution), Donne, Marlowe, Jonson and Day Lewis.

I require the poet, the poem and the period.  Will someone lend a hand?

Thanks.

I've just finished a commission to put Dan Farrell's The Inkblot Record
online for Coach House Books.  In case you haven't checked it out, Coach
House has a really excellent site with their entire catalogue of poetry and
prose available for web reading, including the complete Carnival series (1 &
2, and "outtakes") by Steve McCaffery, a sort of gesamtkunstwerk of concrete
poetry (no sound).

About the online version of The Inkblot Record:

Dan Farrell's second volume of poetry is an examination of a discourse that
everyone knows about but few people have examined in detail: the response of
people to Rorschach inkblot patterns. By turns profound and hilarious, this
book is an insightful statement about the relentless drive to make meaning
out of nothing.  The online version features a dynamic inkblot, designed by Brian Kim
Stefans, to test your own poetic/psychological state of being.

:::

Also, new at Arras, a Flash setting of a chapter of Christian Bok's Eunoia,
a long prose-poem many years in the making.  This is chapter "e", which
excludes all other vowels but "e."  This is not the final version of the
piece, but thought to run it by you.

Finally, I've put up a homepage.  It includes all of my reviews, pet

too lazy right now to design something from the ground up.

Hello all:
Ran across this while surfing. It's the cruelest month again. At least for
the northern hemisphere. In temperate climes.

A Conversation With Robert Pinsky On Poetry And Technology Begins Zooba's
Celebration Of Poetry Month
 BOSTON, MA -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 04/04/2001 -- Zooba (www.zooba.com), a new
media company that delivers entertaining emails on more than 40 topics with
compelling content and related products, for the first time celebrates
National Poetry Month with a series of emails on five of the world's most
acclaimed poets. Launching the series is a discussion with former US Poet
Laureate Robert Pinsky about the use of technology to promote poetry.

Beginning the first week of April, the series on poetry will be sent to
Zooba's Events of the Year and Literature subscribers. The five poets
featured are Robert Frost, Anna Akhmatova, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Walt
Whitman and Robert Pinsky. Each email honors one of these world-renowned
poets with lesser known stories about their remarkable lives and careers.
The first email in the series will include Pinsky's "To Television," a poem
reflecting what he describes in his interview with Zooba as his desire "to
find what seems important, prominent, but not yet poetic."

"The web can be a wonderful locale for poetry--surprisingly, restoring the
vocal, bodily nature of the art. In some ways, audio technology can reach
back to before printed pages, supplying a vocal presence for the poem," said
Pinsky, Poetry Editor at Slate.com, and author of six books of poetry
including his latest, Jersey Rain (2000) and The Figured Wheel: New and
Collected Poems 1965-1995, which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and
received the 1997 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize.
"Zooba provides its subscribers with emails that are both entertaining and
enlightening; our concise format and expansive, but targeted, reach allows
us to celebrate National Poetry Month with hundreds of thousands of people
interested in literature and poetry," said David Beardsley, Editor in Chief
of Zooba. "Through our unique email technology and rapidly growing
subscriber base, Zooba can make poetry, and information on many other
subjects, more accessible to the general public."

About Zooba
All Zooba emails are written in a concise, compelling format and contain
product recommendations that are relevant to the content. Subscribers can
choose from more than 40 topic channels including Great Minds, Food &
Cuisine, Destinations, Fitness, Nutrition & Diet, and Bestsellers, and
receive informative emails that include relevant product recommendations.
For example, an email about Vincent van Gogh might recommend a book about
the artist, a video on his life and a reproduction of one of his works.

Aarin. And I thought Alan was talking about real things! Well, some of the
time. Alan is either a madman or a genius, hopfully somewhere eerily but
brilliantly in between. But I think Alan (whatever his project is and I
admire hime for such a vast project) is incredible. Hope he keeps it up. But
I feel some concern he might :burn out": no? Hope not. Alan Sondheim is
probably keeping Nescafe in business!! But that recent  sentence thing that
someone commented on) by Alan was clever...a lot of excellent stuff (Alan
and Aaron). Amazing,cheers Richard.

** NOTICE **** NOTICE **** NOTICE **** NOTICE **

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives is featured today, alongside
other significant taped poetry collections in the country, in an article by
poet Ammiel Alcalay in the NY Times Op-Ed page (we were bumped yesterday by
the Chinese/spy jet caper).  Note that of the six taped incidents remarked
in the article, five (all except the John Cage-Richard Nixon conjunct) are
from recordings in the American Poetry Archives collection.

Mr. Alcalay visited the Archives here at SFSU last month, when he and
Bosnian poet Semezdin Mehmedinovic' (whose work Alcalay has translated:
Sarajevo Blues, City Lights Books, 1998) read and discussed their work for
the Poetry Center.  Videotapes of their public conversation at The Poetry
Center, and their evening reading to a full
house at the Unitarian Center in San Francisco, join the American Poetry
Archives' vast video collection of contemporary writers that extends from
1973, when Kathleen Fraser rescued rare early audiotapes from being thrown
out and founded the American Poetry Archives.  Audiotapes in the Archives
collection date from 1954.

A printed catalog of Archives holdings available to the public will be
published later this year, with support from the National Endowment for the
Arts.  Currently, a partially completed list of Archives videotape holdings
can be accessed at our website:  www.sfsu.edu/~newlit

        A Fading Poetry

        By AMMIEL ALCALAY

        The ancient Egyptians used stone and parchment, whereas our
collective memory is often stored on acetate, vinyl and emulsion-coated
films -- forms that die quickly.  Much of the documentation of 20th century
American poetry and literary culture is in evanescent form, and it is being
lost.

        On a bicoastal itinerary from New York to San Francisco, with major
stops in Boston, Boulder, Vancouver and Los Angeles, you can find thousands
of decaying reels of audiotape, film and videotape.  Three of the most
important collections are at the Poetry Project in New York City, the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder,
Colo., and the Poetry Archives at San Francisco State University.

        These materials have mainly to do with the New American Poetry,
which includes the Objectivists, the San Francisco Renaissance, the Umbra
and Black Arts movements, the Beats, Black Mountain and the New York
School.  The texts of poets in these many movements are reasonably
accessible, as demonstrated by the magnificent 1998 New York Public Library
exhibition, "A Secret Location on the Lower East Side."  But the sights and
sounds are fading fast.

        Before they disappear, you can still listen to Langston Hughes (in
1958) praising Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti for initiating
poetry-and-jazz performances the year before, an audio moment that neatly
links the Harlem Renaissance, the San Francisco Renaissance and the Beats;
you can hear James Baldwin discuss his novel "Giovanni's Room" with Philip
Roth (in 1960).  While the tape and film last, you can watch John Cage
persisting in a performance piece (about Henry David Thoreau) on the night
Richard Nixon resigned -- as the audience, wanting to celebrate, gets
steadily wilder. You can see a San Francisco poetry reading for gay
liberation in 1971, or Allen Ginsberg in the basement at City Lights
bookstore discussing William Carlos Williams as Neal Cassady arrives.  You
might see young Alice Walker discussing Zora Neale Hurston when the latter
was still forgotten, the former little known.

        Preservation of such materials is incredibly labor-intensive.
Repository institutions are doing their best to protect their archives, but
a greater commitment from public and private donors is desperately needed.
Because many of the films and tapes are by now quite delicate, they must be
re-recorded in real time, with someone monitoring the process.  Existing
tapes may be too weak to endure more than the one playing needed for
transfer [from] masters.

        These materials are an invaluable legacy - readings, classes,
public discussions and other encounters with many of America's most
important writers of the past 50 years.  Ideally, this legacy should be
made available to the public in the most accessible formats, much as the
Smithsonian Institution has preserved our musical heritage.

        Otherwise, we will have at best the corporate version of, say, Jack
Kerouac -- the cropped, airbrushed Beat posing in khakis -- rather than the
dense literary, poetic and social culture from which that photo was lifted
in the name of selling pants.

        Ammiel Alcalay is a poet and author of "Memories of Our Future:
Selected Essays, 1982-1999."

The "right to be lonely" could also suggest the hope of being alone yet
understood as also social even within one's solitariness. Solitude, as a
pretty noun religiously linked to creativity's desiderata, may be
acknowledged to be necessary; this admission is often anodyne. But there is
a stronger solitude which refuses to be understood as merely presocial and
which rejects the benevolent will to make everything, and it too, familial.
=20
This solitude groans at the prospect of being tenderly brought into the
domain of the new social; its bearers are in no constellation but tolerate
being units of one, are maybe childless, parentless, without siblings,
unattached, unmarried, widowed, are not communitarian, are transiently or
even (they can't know) permanently single, and are not in a panic. They
simply find themselves alone. The question "how single is single?" could
ask: how might such singleness be considered neither pathological nor be
swept up,in an ostentatious de-pathologising, into a compulsive sociability?
The figure of the Solitary might yet be retrieved, and in terms other than
her failure to attain to the family. Might a properly recognised state of
singleness (to wrench the notion of "recognition" away from its usual
oppressively gregarious tone) recast that desolate and resentment-prone
metaphoricity of social exclusion =AD might it also somewhat allay the=
 burden
of those who may sometimes find themselves living in solitude at the very
same time that they live within the family?

Ah, the Coppper Poet! Yeah! I recall him well...I'd be out on a job and
wouldnt you know "Woo wah! Woo wah!" and flashing lights and a siren. But
that Cop...the Poet Cop: he had the whole thing set up. And you'd have a
choice: 1. In the slammer, no breakfast. 2. Listen to 4 hours of the Poet
Cop and go free. A lot of me mates folded and just went in quietly. But I
got to know some brilliantly awful and wonderfully obscene doggeral. The
funny thing was it grew on you. You found yourself smiling. I mean, there i
was or were, me tools and jemmy aside me, and old Bill the Poet Cop was on
and on about his old Mum or some Sheila who travelled the world. But there
was no malice. Just briliantly cadenced drivel. Rumour has it that Rod
McKuen was his natural born son but I dont beleive that. He was too busy
with his endless poems. (Bill the Cop Poet I mean). He was also a dab hand
with straight out invective. He'd say things like: "I'm a bloody failed
detective with a reumy old mum so I took up invective." Surprising things
like that, and then of he'd go...hours and hours of brillant drivel...which
reminds me I'd better sign off. Regards, Richioso.

Poetry, prose, satire, collage, red marginalia, infuriated scribblings,
utopias, lament cycles, editorials, comic monologues, vexed =

Please also forward this invitation to all able-minded potential
participants.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

And if you need inspiration, you might recall that during his first =
seventy
days in office...

-- appointed the richest cabinet in history: seven of its members own =
assets
worth more than $10m (=A36.8m); eleven of the remaining 12 are =
millionaires;
most
have ties to the energy, drug, and technologies industries;
-- appointed John Ashcroft - prohibitionist, religious zealot, racist,
misogynist, Confederate hardliner, right-wing reactionary - Attorney
General;
-- nominated, as ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte: =
U.S.
ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985, and a zealous anti-Communist
crusader
in America's covert wars against the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua
and the FMLN rebels in El Salvador, Negroponte abetted and covered up =
human
rights crimes, including the kidnapping, torture and murder of hundreds =
of
Hondurans by Battalion 316, a secret army intelligence unit trained and
supported by the CIA;
-- appointed Donald Rumsfeld US Defence Secretary, with Paul Wolfowitz =
as
his
deputy; both are hawks and longtime supporters of active US efforts to
promote
the overthrow of President Saddam by sanctions, military strikes and
military
and other aid to the Iraqi opposition;
-- stripped the ABA of its role as a vetting agency in the appointment =
of
federal judges; that role is now occupied, unofficially, by the =
Federalist
Society for Law and Public Policy, a right-wing organization opposed to
affirmative action, laws against sexual harassment, and environmental
protection legislation;

-- reinstituted the 'global gag rule' banning US foreign aid to
international
organizations or groups in foreign countries that promote abortion or
include
it as an option in their counseling;
-- proposed a "Faith-Based Initiative" to allow religious organizations =
to
compete with secular social services groups for federal dollars =
intended to
help the needy;
-- presided over the distribution of the 2000 census, from which only =
'raw
figures' will be released to states, not adjusted figures that could =
protect
against an estimated net undercount of 3.3 million people, mostly
minorities;
-- passed an Executive Order overriding eight years' worth of worker =
safety
legislation;

-- rescinded his campaign promise, and rejected the Kyoto protocols =
aimed at
reducing carbon emissions;
-- incorporated initial moves to open the Alaskan National Wildlife =
refuge
to
oil drilling into his budget package

-- proposed across-the-board tax cuts totalling $1.6 trillion over 10 =
years;
-- proposed the elimination of inheritance tax, which affects only the
wealthiest 2% of the population with estates worth more than $675,000;
-- alluded to a proposal to cut the already modest funding for =
child-care
assistance for low-income families, programs designed to investigate =
and
combat
child abuse, and a new program to train pediatricians and other doctors =
at
children's hospitals across the U.S.;
-- thanks to assiduous efforts by credit card companies and banks, the =
House
rushed through a bill changing bankruptcy legislation to make it =
radically
more
difficult for middle-class consumers to escape overwhelming consumer =
debt;
-- proposed a budget plan allocating an extra $14bn (=A39.7bn) to =
defence
spending, taking the Pentagon's budget for next year to $310bn, or =
about a
third of the total world military spending.  $2.6bn - part of a $20bn
five-year
program - allocated to fund research and development of new weapon
technologies, roughly half of which is earmarked for NMD (national =
missile
defence);

-- spurned North Korea (called, by Condoleezza Rice, "the road kill of
history"); told South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung he was ending the
policy
of engagement and negotiation with the Pyongyang regime, mistakenly =
warning
"Part of the problem in dealing with North Korea...there's not very =
much
transparency. We're not certain as to whether or not they're keeping =
all
terms
of all agreements" (the US has only one agreement with North Korea, and =
more
careful officials are disinclined to accuse North Korea of deception);
-- was 'complimentary' when briefed by Rumsfeld about plans to overhaul
America's arsenal to face the new Chinese threat by replacing =
dependence on
aircraft carriers and short-range fighters with long-range bombers =
capable
of
flying across the world's widest sea to fight and win a nuclear war.  =
Its
diplomatic efforts rebuffed, China announced it will increase defense
spending
by 18%;
-- made it clear that he will push ahead with selling the Aegis missile
radar
system to Taiwan, enabling the island to steal a military edge over the
mainland - which China stresses will rupture relations between Beijing =
and
Washington;
-- authorized air strikes on radar stations around Baghdad, killing two =
and
injuring eleven people;
-- issued an order permitting Iraqi opposition groups to begin limited =
moves
inside Iraq using US government funding;
-- the CIA abandoned its efforts to persuade Israel and the =
Palestinians to
renew security cooperation;
-- welcomed Ariel Sharon; agreed that Israel's security concerns must =
come
first, that a Clinton-style comprehensive Middle East peace deal was =
not
worth
pursuing, and even perhaps that Yasser Arafat not be given a White =
House
audience until he definitively halts the intifada violence;
-- suggested the US might move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem;
-- expelled around 50 Russian diplomats, reigniting cold-war tensions =
and
jeopardizing Russian co-operation with American intelligence now in =
Russia
monitoring 'loose nukes'.  Rumsfeld accused Russia of being "an active
proliferator";

-- was honorary chairman of the USS Missouri Restoration Fund - the =
Fund's
donors include the 16 civilians, almost all Texans with ties to the =
energy
industry (particularly petroleum), on the ill-fated Greenville =
submarine
that
sank a Japanese fishing vessel;

-- in an address to 4,000 people on Feb. 28, said "those of us who =
spent
time
in the agricultural sector and in the heartland, we understand how =
unfair
the
death penalty is -- the death tax is,'' correcting himself. He then =
joked:
"I
don't want to get rid of the death penalty, just the death tax," =
laughing
along
with the crowd.

uh, Richard and Aaron, Alan was talking about real things. advice to 'just
not worry about it' is what has led to the state of America and *politics as
usual*. if we just ignore it, _it won't go away_... but our country will.
i would suggest the Green Party. they have an interesting and refreshing
platform. and now that the book 'Green Politics' is no longer banned in
America, anyone can at least inform themselves, make active thoughtful
choices.
hang in there, Alan ! people do care, are working, are talking, are becoming
more aware. the greatest danger at this point is despair.
onward and upward,
beth

Hi Everyone,

Please help me make more books. I just published:

Jordan Davis
_YEAH, NO_
No ISBN, $6.00
Poetry. Six new, longish poems by the author of _POEM ON A TRAIN_
(Barque Press). "In a director's chair / waiting for a movie crew //
The sentence is just / as afraid of you // ... Too stoned to wrestle
Big Bird ..." Of Davis's poems, Susan Wheeler remarks: "Frequently
casual and talky on the surface, their underpinnings reflect a slice
of a day in a sentient, reading, economic, sexual, class-rooted,
spiritual self -- precisely observed as the world is precisely
observed by that keenly observant self. The effect is smart and
generous." "Jordan Davis," David Shapiro writes, "is one of the young
poets who make me confident that poetry is busily being born. ... His
poetry is full of stories, gossip, charms, observations, art
criticism, and mordant innuendoes ... where the everyday drifts into
exaltation." Cover and frontispiece by Will Yackulic. Author portrait
by Gary Sullivan. 24 pp. Detour 2001.

Buy from SPD, or direct from me. If from me, send check for six bucks
made out to Gary Sullivan (NOT Detour), to:

Gary Sullivan
558 - 11th Street, #1B
Brooklyn, NY  11215

Also, I think David Kirschenbaum mentioned this already, but he
published a limited edition calendar for which I drew a portrait of
d.a.levy. You can see it online & get ordering info at:

http://www.theeastvillageeye.com/boog/levycal.htm

Thanks,

Gary

Subject:      introducing...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This is to announce to the unwary world the existence of yet another
"school" of poetry (but one which will, no doubt, prove more vital than many
that have come before)-- the School of Continuation!

The School of Continuation consists of Jane Dalrymple-Hollo, Mark DuCharme,
Anselm Hollo, Patrick Pritchett and Laura E. Wright.

The School is, "by temperament of its members more than conscious choice...
a micro-community devoted to the study, the selfish pleasure and above all
the PRACTICE of poetry. We have no official program; we hold no discussions
of theory; we do not organize conferences or symposia; there are no events
(other than readings, which are not official functions of the School). We
don't even have meetings*, though we all see each other regularly. What we
do (excepting Jane, who paints) is write poems.... The tendency of poets to
be drawn to, and at the same time be suspicious of, group formations, makes
sense when one looks at the social circumstances in which writing occurs.
However much the poem may be born of dialogic or even activist impulses, the
act of putting words together takes place in a kind of fundamental (if not
ideological) isolation. This is so, even though afterwards the poet may
socialize with her peers. Not just the isolation of the act of writing, but
the heavily marginalized status of poetry and especially of experimental
poetry in this country, creates the need for such alliances. One can either
give in to the competitiveness which a limitation of resources
sociologically fosters -- or one can cooperate in cells of compatible
tendency and good will. The School of Continuation is one experiment in the
latter form of social production.

*Except when we do. (The School of Continuation contradicts itself with
regularity)."

The above statement appears on our new web site, which has been graciously
designed by Lisa Jarnot.  Anyone interested can view the site at:

http://members.nbci.com/subpress/soc.htm

There is also a new journal, which so far hasn't been announced on this
list, that contains a sampling of works by most of the members of the
School, as well as work by a variety of others.  It is Mantis #1, available
for $10.00 from:

English Department
Stanford University
Stanford, CA 94305-2087

Future activities of the School of Continuation will be announced on this
list whenever it seems relevant to do so.  Look for information in the
coming months about the press we are starting.  Among the publications
planned will be a mini-anthology of manifestos, poems and drawings by the
members of the School.

For the School of Continuation,

Mark DuCharme

I'm writing this post out of ignorance, despair, anger. I will confess
readily to the first, even the idiocy of it.

I thought this was great!  After the long intro, you can read it in every and any order.
The flash does neat fades between any slide:  you can almost read the different poems
fading into the other poem of your choice.

I wish this was a joke. Unfortunately it's not, is it? It fascinates me how
an awareness of poetry, even evidence of a having read some of the same, can
coincide with a complete absence of linguistic tact, a blindness to obvious
tack.

I just reread Mr. B's "Against NPM As Such" -- a perfect bag of hammers.
What an encouragement.

To commemorate Nat'l Mainstream Poetry Month, I have a tirade of my own.
It's not much of a tirade, as you'll see.  More of a pack of lies mixed in
with several truths, in ballad form.  Take it as it's intended: humorously,
not hatefully.

Cheers, everyone.  I hope the cruellest month is taking it easy on all us
otherstreamers.

POETS

There once was a man named Donald Hall
Whose work as a poet gained him notoriety.
He read it in many an auditorium and hall
Without arrogance, and with just a titch of piety.

There once was a woman named Anne Waldman,
A mysterious witch-like pot-smoking poet
Who floated in and out of Naropa like a shaman.
Her poetry's not great. If you read it, you'll know it.

There once was a poet named Philip Levine
Whose work in an auto factory long ago
Led to a lifelong fixation with the assembly line,
Some of which yielded poems that were only so-so.

There once was a man named James Merrill,
A poet who disciplined himself to work in form.
Unfortunately a lot of his stuff seems sterile,
But then that's the main risk of working in form.

There once was  a fellow named Derek Walcott
Who also worked in form, a lot like Merrill.
But despite all the major literary awards he's got,
A lot of his writing also sounds sterile.

There once was a bad poet named Maya Angelou
Who's claim to fame was that she read at the forty-first
Inauguration in '92. People were too polite to boo.
She is, however, a very capable autobiographist.

There once was a writer named Robert Pinsky
Who had been accused of being too "ivory tower."
One time his wife slammed the Volvo door on his pinky,
And he screamed loudly for almost an hour.

Once there was a poet, Jorie Graham,
Who wrote in a stuttering, film-like style.
She saw the world as if through Poet Cam.
Scrutiny, however, finds little behind this style.

There once was a poet named Denise Levertov,
And damn it, I really want to like her work.
But there's something about her that pisses me off.
It may be that her ideas seem precious & overworked.

And there was one a poet named Kenneth Koch.
He made his name by being associated with pop figures
Such as Andy Warhol. But his work is often lost in the smoke
Of the fire of his friends, Ashbery, Schuyler, Snyder.

And there was another one named Louise Gl=FCck.
Nobody except David Lehman knows how to say it.
I used to think it rhymed with the F word, hick
That I am. Her poetry is predictable, though few will say it.

Once there was a woman named Heather McHugh.
Now here's a tongue-twisting poet I can relate to.
Maybe you'll be able to relate to her too.
Next time you're at Borders, look up Heather McHugh.

Off in the corner was a weirdo named Mike Topp.
A poet like the others, but without the awards.
His writing makes me laugh and say "Stop!
That tickles!"  He really deserved some awards.

There once was a man named John Ashbery,
Among a handful of poets both celebrated and great.
His poetry was at the same time clean-shaven and hairy.
Often people who like him also like James Tate.

There once was a man named James Tate:
Dogs playing poker from the beginning.
But sometimes you wish he'd just lay it out straight,
Tell it like it is, like in the one about his dad, spinning.

There once was a poet named Allen Ginsberg,
A very great gay writer who achieved extreme fame
And will be remembered for his spontaneous words,
Mostly "Howl" et al. His later work is kind of lame.

There once was a poet named Amy Clampitt,
Another one with the name of Yehuda Amichai,
And although I admire her, I can't get into Clampitt,
But to tell the truth I do like Yehuda Amichai.

There once was a poet named Galway Kinnell,
And there was another one named Sharon Olds;
Whether or not they're great only time will tell,
And Sharon is younger than Galway, but still old.

There once was a fine poet named Seamus Heaney
And another pretty good one named Thomas Gunn.
There was yet another one named Joseph Brodsky
And yet another one named Mona Van Duyn.

And there was a poet by the name of A.R. Ammons
Who didn't at all appreciate the work of Donald Hall,
But didn't mention that as they dined together on salmon
And beer with several other poets during Breadloaf last fall.

ECOPOETICS: CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS!

Now that the days are longer, consider contributing to ECOPOETICS / writing
surrounds.

While honoring the long tradition of "nature writing," ECOPOETICS finds
pastoralism, art representing nature, at an impasse.  At the same time, the
writing edge seems to offer no new take on surrounds, mainly environmental
silence, or passive regrets.  If there are exceptions, ECOPOETICS hopes to
gather them.

ECOPOETICS seeks responses to the question: _where_ is writing?  Whose
leaves are contiguous to body, street, yard, park or waterfront, sky, lawn,
brownfield, industry, farmland, or the "wild"-- environs from the porch to
the South Pole-- in every case peopled with more than humans.

If, as O'Hara claims, "one never need leave the confines of New York to get
all the greenery one wishes," any _where_ entails an extended sense of
people, into other species, and a "greenery" subject to waste
(mis)management; flows and deposits of gases, heavy metals and synthetic
organic compounds; eco-nomics; and the growing map of environmental
injustice.  Might not discourses and practices of soil, water, air, energy
make poetics?  Responses from other languages, especially translated along
north-south lines, are urgently sought.

Examples and discussion both are invited: poems, translations, essays,
reviews, letters, journals, investigations, lists, divinations, prayers,
riddles, maps, documented acts, performances and installations, unearthings,
practical advice, etc., will be considered.  Preferable means of delivery is
by email attachment.  (If a visually determined piece is accepted, then a
hard copy may be useful.)  ECOPOETICS will read submissions for the next
eight weeks, through May, 2001.  Don't miss your chance to participate in
the first, exciting issue!

-------------------------------------------------
The visual artist Barbara Bloom included in an installation of hers vitrines
of "found" printed matter.  One showcase had a magazine photo pose of Marilyn,
dressed to the collar, sitting outdoors on a log or out in the bucolics.  She
was holding a book.  The cover of the thick book: James Joyce, 'Ulysses.'

Any tips on in which of the various books her gems may be scattered, Dave?
Sounds like the best undiscovered since Candy Darling's poems.

(Digression following Joyce and unlikely, American female celebrities:

There used to be a "Ripley's Believe It or Not" television series.  Once they
did a segment on James Joyce, especially his "Finegans Wake."  The moderator
walking us through the footage and Joyceana was--- MARGOT THOMAS!  ( I swear.
Watched it with my own eyes, on a small black and white TV, mid- to
late-'80's.)

But now, the reason they were featuring Joyce on "Ripley's" was not because he
was a titan of unbelievable proportions or because "Finegans Wake" is
incredible in its neologistic coinages, but--- because James Joyce had VERY
POOR VISION and managed to write such BIG BOOKS despite his handicap!

They showed closed-ups of the artifact of his eyeglasses, and how
progressively large his handwriting became as his vision deteriorated.

Can you believe that a person with eyes that bad could heroically transcend
his optical disability enough to scribble illegibly and unintelligibly like
this all over notebooks and get it printed?

Sorry, Beth.  It wasn't that clear to me, especially considering the phrase
"I will confess readily to the [ignorance], even the idiocy of it" at the
beginning, and then all the backing up and hedging at the end.   It sounded
like a brilliant Sondheim setup/sendup to me, but I see now that I stand
corrected (and I feel like a heel).

Carl Rakosi: A Tribute

Housing Works
126 Crosby Street
One block east of Broadway, south of Houston
6:30 pm (sharp) to 8 pm

Carl Rakosi was born in 1903, and at age 98, is the last of the great
early American Modernist. In the Thirties he was a leading member of
the Objectivist Group, which also included William Carlos Williams,
Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and Lorine Niedecker.
The hard details and fresh perspective of Rakosi's work emerge from a
poetry of distinctive naming. Robert Creeley says that, "In Carl
Rakosi's poems there is no false face of charitable intent, no
specious wish to help without commitment, no understanding wherewith
to obliterate acknowledgement. Carl Rakosi's determined honesty and
reductive rhetoric with its ungainsayable plainsong have made a
measure for all conduct of words in the attempt to find an active
poetry in the fact of lives without power, still hoping for change and
admission..."

Housing Works Inc. is a minority-controlled, community-based,
not-for-profit organization that provides housing, health care,
advocacy and support services to homeless men, women and children
living with HIV and AIDS. Founded in 1990, Housing Works' mission is
to help people living with AIDS and HIV who are homeless or at risk of
homelessness to gain stability, security and independence so that they
can live their lives with hope and dignity.

Carl Rakosi's COLLECTED POEMS were published in 1986 by The National
Poetry Foundation and his COLLECTED PROSE in 1983 by the same
publisher. CARL RAKOSI, MAN AND POET, edited by Michael Heller, a
large collection of critical articles on his work, together with two
bibliographies, interviews, and new work by him came out in 1993, and
in 1995 Sun and Moon Press brought out POEMS 1923-1941, which won the
PEN AWARD that year. His latest book is THE EARTH SUITE, published in
England in 1997 by Etruscan Books.

Anyone who would like to be in a school
with me please backchannel.

Maybe we could call it "The Cool School."
That is only one of many possible names.

Thanks.

I've put together what URLs for Ramez's work online I could find. I
know there's at least one missing (a review of Hejinian's Happily in
How2, which is temporarily inaccessible), and maybe others will be
found. If you know of any not here, please email me. Thanks.

A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

NO READINGS OR WORKSHOPS DURING EASTER WEEK!
The Poetry Project is suspending all of its programming (i.e., readings and
workshops) during Easter week, Monday, April 9th through Friday, April 13th.
Our regular programming will resume on Monday, April 16th.

Tonight at the Poetry Project

Friday, April 6th at 10:30 PM
A CELEBRATION OF KENNETH REXROTH'S SWORDS THAT SHALL NOT STRIKE: POEMS OF
PROTEST AND REBELLION
Readers include Grace Paley, Eliot Weinberger, Eileen Myles, Ishle Park,
Robert Nichols, and the book's editor, Geoffrey Gardner. A founder of the
San Francisco literary renaissance of the late 1950s, Kenneth Rexroth
(1905-1982) was integral to the emergence of the Beat poets. He was a
confirmed anarchist for most of his life, first socialist, then a
syndicalist. At this reading, poets will read selections from Swords That
Shall Not Strike and then follow with their own work, with the aim of
illustrating Mr. Rexroth's claim that "the poet, by the very nature of
his/her art, has been an enemy of society."

*  *  *

Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.
The Poetry Project, located in St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2nd Avenue
and 10th Street in Manhattan, is wheelchair accessible with assistance and
advance notice. Please call (212) 674-0910 for more information or visit our
Web site at http://www.poetryproject.com.

Greetings to our poet friends sprinkled about the globe--
A recent program here at Writers House was particularly popular and
engaging.  We've recently uploaded it to our Website for your viewing.

The recording of the "Un-American Poetry," featuring  poets and scholars

        AMMIEL ALCALAY     BEN HOLLANDER    MURAT NEMET-NEJAT

is now available in our Webcast archive.  The program is a discussion
of writing, translation, globalization, politics in the Middle East, the
foreign poet's relation to language, the foreigner's relation to nation,
contemporary American, Israeli, Turkish and Bosnian poetry, and more.  To
access this program, click on the "Un-American Poetry" link at:

Jonathan. i'm interested, but while I love "nature" as we all generally
understand it - and my city Auckland (NZ) is a very green city and in a very
green country. I have mixed feelings about the often hazy use of natural, or
organic, and so on. O'Hara of course also enjoyed getting to the beach and
its obvious from his poems that he _emphasises_ the city_but that doesnt
exclude flowers etc Anyway: how is it that anything can be considered non
natural? Or even non organic. In strict technical terminology water is an
inorganic chemical (slightly acidic) and plastic is an organic compund whose
structure is fundamentally similar to the long chain compounds that make up
'natural' things.. Much as I am an enthusiast for Wordsworth and others of
the Romantics:" think of his poem about London "Upon Westminster Bridge".
And what about the human brain: is that not a natural thing? Operating
incredibly and forever mysteriously in its strange consciousness: but just
as natural or unnatural as anyting else in the universe.
  Nor am I certain that our human survival or even the survival of anything
else is of significance to whatever "Force" motivates the universe. Alan
Curnow (of New Zealand, possibly the graetest living poet) has an ambigous
view of nature as revealed in the latest issue of the New Zealand Listener.
And so did Wordswoth, Coleridge, even Blake.
  I myself feel the beauty of nature (as we commonly refer to it) but also
the marvellousness of man made things (I say man made purposely, I dont want
to weaken my point here) but also the terrible aspects of both.
  One marvels at the complexity and ingenuity of various machinery...in all
cases technology or nature (even IF the two can be separated), like human
hands they can either " murder or create" as Eliot puts it in Prufrock.
depends whose hands the hands are in, or the technology, or if you turn your
back on a tiger at the wrong moment. Just some thoughts. But good luck for
your project(s). Regards, Richard.

OK Allen. My concern was for Alan Sondheim himself: I didnt mean a "head in
the sand approach" but one can get so "burning up inside" (I've done so)
that things become distorted. I dont think any terrible disastor(s) will
occur. Look back into history... sub specie aeternitatis even if there's
(and i doubt it very much) another World War happens or is caused it will be
taken in Time's stride: we'll be "shocked" at how many survive and how well.
Sure these are important issues, but they are never worth an individual's
deaspair or self sacrifice. Deal with things as they arise. Keep cool: stay
alert, but dont get too involved! That's the way to survive! Humour. We need
more humour, laughter, and fun. "She'll be right." as the old Kiwi saying
goes. A good approach is Bruce Andrews sometimes brilliantly funny and
simultaneously serious critiques and stimuli through the deliberate
distortion and play of language and all them kinda  things. Reccommend
Andrews as an antidote to "political blues": or the "brainy" bloke's
Seinfeld.  Regards, Richard.

how can i see these movies of yours, and the snow movie you mention.
perhaps because they are not out there, i could not take them into
consideration. they certainly are not mentioned in the literary texts
i have read or the websites i have visited,

i have been told that e melo de Castro in brazil was making
videopoetry in 1968, but where is the archive?

But,

the poets and their poems i mentioned in my posts are out there on
the net, and maybe you can choose history to select isolated examples
from the past, but what i am saying is that there are lots of people
using letter and syllable parataxis in their work at the present
moment.

the new media may not be new but it is new for many people who
perhaps dont have the history of poetry and film-making to draw upon.

then popular art was never your bag.


cheers

Catherine Daly lives across the street from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los
Angeles and works as a software developer.  The Hacker's Dictionary definition
of "Turing tar pit" is "a place where anything is possible but nothing of
interest is practical."  She can be reached at cadaly@pacbell.net.



Turing Tar Pits

I could take that job and live on the beach for the summer.
Summer would stretch into fall and Christmas
in the Southern Californian way.

We would miss me here at the tar pits.
Take the pet with you.

I could take a job where they'd send me to school,
away from early until late.

You might as well live in paradise then, and be single.

Would you help me fix up my dorm room?
Could I come home weekends?

Even if there were jobs at the tar pits,
doing them would be like being home,
and I want to get away
and then return.

My old job seems more interesting from the tar pits
than it was.
Good jobs and poetry where we don't live.

Without a job, I can't to move anywhere nice,
away from the tar pits.

Nothing interesting is practical.
I had a job an hour away but I didn't see any more people
than I see around the house
after the woman I shared an office with
left since there were no people in the office.

My supervisor escorted me to the women's room
for national security reasons
every time I had to pee.  It was a dull job.
I couldn't drink the coffee I needed to stay awake.

 I had a job nearby but it didn't pay well enough
for me to get a car.
The bus only dropped off, didn't pick up,
at the stop.

The harder I work,
the deeper writings' inadequacies draw me.

If I live here at the tar pits I can write, yet
I could write dull poetry here until I run out of money.

Hi, list!

Thought I'd interrupt my protracted silence by posting my review of August
Kleinzahler's early collected. It originally appeared in the fall issue of
_Harvard Review_. Any opinions/comments are most welcome!

Cheers,
Philip Nikolayev

__________________________________
Live from the Hong Kong Nile Club. Poems: 1975-1990 by August Kleizahler.
Farrar, Strauss and Giroux: New York, 2000. ISBN 0-374-52701-6 (paper). $15.

        The 25-40 year old August Kleinzahler of these poems, essentially
continuous with the poet that we know today, already shows a dazzling
mastery of Imagist “painting with words.” The selections are drawn from a
few long-out-of-print volumes, and instead of being arranged traditionally
“by book,” come divided into two large groups by coast – “East” and “West.”
While one is struck by the laconic spareness of some of these poems compared
to the recent work, their minimalism hides a compressed exuberance. A high
density of thought and a persuasive earthiness of tone are aided by the
frequent choice of short, chiefly monosyllabic words. The verbal economy
gives freedom to a memorable, image-drunk voice.
        Consistent with the poet’s education, his early style is at times
exquisitely imbued with dictions borrowed from the Far East, but retains
enough melancholy to dispel any suspicions of Zen-clarity, as in this
haiku-like stanza: “A cruel word at eventide / and night zips up / like a
spider’s retreat.” The writing is experimental, full-blooded and rooted in
life experience. It reveals life’s raw, harsh beauty. This is a lyric
poetry, peculiar in its self-estranged insight that “the ego is a ghost
ship.” Its subject-matter is “self” rather than “the self,” experience
rather than identity. An implicit Machism is at work behind the scenes – a
monistic metaphysic which takes experience to be the only substance, thus
eliminating the boundary between the self and the world. Experience is
captured in clusters of vivid and often disjoint, montage-like images which
combine into subjective portraits of moments in the universal flux.
        The poetic vision is often fractured, yet largely retains a powerful
holistic coherence because it posits meaningful continuities in nature,
where “spirit and flesh played blithely in each other’s yard.” The mind is
mixed with the body and the body with the world, which is itself perceived
in terms of the body – of its various parts, hair, fluids – all purified by
the imagination and elevated to the status of empirical abstraction.  There
are many vivid anthropomorphic portraits of weather and landscape; the
texture of some verses has the crunchiness of fresh snow.
        Kleinzahler is obsessed with the organic, mortal stuff of life. “Storm over
Hackensack” begins: “This angry bruise about to burst / on City Hall / will
spend itself fast / so fluid and heat may build again.” But the poem itself
“builds” toward a sublime telos: “This is the gods’ perpetual light: /
clarity / jeopardy / change.” In Kleinzahler’s anthropomorphic aesthetics
experience supplies not only the subject-matter but also the poetic method
itself, which is at once somatic and cosmic, solemn and ironic: “the Mind is
a too much thing / cleansing itself like a great salt sea.” The whole tenor
of the volume works against the postmodern “dissociation of sensibility.”
Poetic language reconstitutes the meaningful oneness of perception while
coloring it in turn with its own materiality. Perception is mixed with
language, and reality is style all along the zigzag from Jersey City to San
Francisco.
        Finally, the self is continuous trough empathy with other selves.
Kleinzahler portrays people very memorably. In “Where Galuccio Lived,” an
old Italian is characterized tragically through a description of his abode,
vacated by death and now being renovated. Galuccio’s painful loneliness, old
age and even the fact of his death are all unambiguously implied by the
anthropomorphic apartment, but never referred to explicitly. The only thing
mentioned about Galuccio himself is that he had a “busted leg.”
        Many of these “early selected” poems have a Dostoyevskian depth, and all
invite multiple reading.

Subject:      Hawai`i education strikes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

I'm writing to ask everyone to pay attention to the strikes by =
University of Hawai`i faculty and public school teachers, strikes that =
began this past Thursday.  Like so many things that happen in this =
state, these are important events, and like so many things that happen =
in this state, they tend to be ignored on the US continent as some kind =
of "trouble in paradise."

The UH budget has been slashed by one third (yes!) in the past seven =
years.  When I came to UH in 1990, my salary was competitive with that =
of other comparable schools; it is no longer.  Faculty and student =
morale is exceedingly low.

The governor at one point offered us a tiny increase but said that we =
would have to pay retirement and health benefits over the summers "when =
we don't work."  He is now trying to cut our health benefits during the =
strike.  And he won't talk with the unions until Tuesday, though the =
strike began on Thursday.

The governor is trying to turn UH into a community college.  He is =
trying to break our union and that of the teachers.  Please pay =
attention.

We have a lot of public support, though one man told me today (as I =
handed him a leaflet he pledged to throw away) that "if you think you're =
so hot you should get jobs at other universities on the mainland."  He =
didn't seem impressed by my arguments about the importance of research =
universities or my claim that I and others actually don't want to leave =
Hawai`i.  He was, alas, a "mainland haole," living up to his stereotype, =
as did several others I encountered today.  One man, claiming to be a =
student, told me I should be "ashamed."  He was driving a red =
convertible Jaguar.  Must have been a business student (they meet on =
Saturdays).

Strike information is available from kitv.com, honoluluadvertiser.com, =
star-bulletin.com.  I've seen stories in the NY Times, the Washington =
Post, and heard about us on NPR.  The Chronicle of Higher Ed is sending =
someone to cover the strike. =20

aloha, Susan

i both simultaneously join this new and exciting
movement (if they will have me) - clearly a
breath mint for the halitosis of the new
millenium and concurrently renounce all
affiliations (if they will allow me to leave) for
failing poetry utterly and completely and totally
and in every way possible - i mean i joined and
read the magazines and memorised the manifesto
and my poems got not one jot better! - not that
the individuals involved were not a more
charming, classy sort of folk than the usual sort
of person you chat in line with in Starbucks

of course i will be hosting a colloquium through

i think T-Boz has one out now too - too bad i
lost my wallet the other day with my Chapter's
One card so i won't get my discount when i buy 20
copies

not a celebrity poetry book by any stretch - but
an interesting book i remember seeing as a kid
was "How to Be Like Me" by none other than the
semi-famous at the time Tina Yuthers of "Family
Ties" - i'd love to have been in the marketing
meeting that came up with the idea for that one

there's been mention of Marylin Monroe's poetry -
has it been collected anyhere? an interesting
synchronicity because i've been reading Robert
Anthon Wilson's book ABOUT synchronicity titled
"Coincidance" in which he talks about the poetry
Norma Jean read and wrote - along with the usual
RA Wilson conspiracy theories that are always
most excellent

does anyone remember Leaping Lenny Poffo from the
halcyon days of WWF in the 80s? he used to read a
poem mocking his opponents before his ass got
trounced by some guy who was 3x larger than him -
he only got in the WWF because he was the Macho
Man Randy Savage's brother - nepotism pays

my official vote for the poetry stamp is one for
Leaping Lenny Poffo - how many poets do you know
are willing to take a chair in the head for their
art? - some, but not many, certainly not Spock,
who was more or less a pacifist - i picture the
stamp as a blue-red "3D" stamp where if you are
wearing 3D glasses Lenny seems to be flying right
at you with a hard bound copy of "The Collected
Poems of ee cummings" raised over head to smash
the noggin

I have been remiss.  Please try to make it out to Mills College this Sunday
p..m. to see Eddie Prevost, John Tilbury, Keith Rowe (aka AMM) in a rare
west-coast appearance from the UK.  AMM since their late 1960s
manifestation when they were working with Cornelius Cardew has been without
doubt among the most consistently amazing creative music ensembles I'm
aware of.   Highly recommended.   Much much healthier than that post tv
dinner you are preparing to hunker around this sunday evening.    a totally
unforeseen music-------   steve dickison

Somehow, once again we have an Inbox full of messages
heterogeneously dated from earlier in the week, all
having shown up over-night last night; most likely,
these were restored after a problem with UB's mail
server caused us to lose service on Tuesday and

There is plenty of information on contests in the past archives, some I
have contributed on this subject

Unpublished poets win contests?

Yes. The Editors choice for the Pavement Saw Press Transcontinental
Award last year was Daniel Zimmerman who only had poems in two
magazines, College English and Exquisite Corpse. While I have read a
split chapbook of his with John Clarke put out by Oasia, I recognized
none of his poems when they arrived to me without a name on the
manuscript after the first three readers paired the numbers down. It was
my first choice. When the contest judge did not choose this book, I had
written down the manuscript number, had it returned, found out who it
was and accepted the manuscript. The contest did well enough that we
were able to afford to publish this book in addition to the Judges
choice: Jeffrey Levine's Mortal, Everlasting. Howard McCord, the judge,
nor Jeffrey Levine knew who each other was. Creeley, perhaps, would not
be writing the introduction for Zimmerman's Post-Avant book if good
truck on us was not in circulation. Contests can be a useful way in
which to make that word more visible once a year. I do not believe
Zimmerman, having gone over two decades without a first book, is a
"certified poet" in the manner mentioned.

> or are publishers simply using a
> marketing gimmick, one they obviously feel is helpful?

I think many are. I have been told of contests chosen beforehand. From
this vantage we see how it happens also. The longer I stay in this
business it becomes apparent that WELL KNOWN authors expect me to
publish their students material due to a cover letter "introducing"
them to me for the contest. Usually this is shortly followed with a
phone call (never an e-mail, if you wish to use this method) in which I
am queried by the WELL KNOWN author, who usually flatters me at least
once before I offend them. This is where I think Bob G. & I agree,
poetry ain't about making friends.

We are usually only a first book and selected/collected publisher. I
have a noble, & oft called naive, idea about poetry, that it shouldn't
be about corruption, whether through coercion by well known brand name
endorsement or flat out offers of loot to publish a collection, I have
been criticized for rejecting both. So far its been about the poems
themselves. We are publishing 10 poetry titles this year, including
first books by 5 authors. Our ethical methods of contest use, and our
understanding of contests as only one option in a lexicon of marketing
tools, has worked for us.

Be well

=== The New Peri Bathous by Emma Featherwaite ===

Or the Art of Falling Flat on Your Face and Embarrassing Yourself in Poetry

(excerpt) "The ability to produce howlers in the midst of otherwise solemn
poetry should not be confused with less intense variations of the muse.
These include not only repetition, forms of self-parody common to most
poets, but poetry written when the mind is out to lunch, on days when
personal elevators don't quite reach the top floor. Two such examples will
quickly establish the great superiority of the previous examples."


=== Linh Dinh reports from Saigon ===
Hit Ya' Back!

(excerpt) "Eighty percent of Vietnamese will claim that they are Buddhists.
What this means, most of them will have a hard time explaining. Visits to a
temple are for the purpose of praying for personal gains, not to hear a
sermon...In the Vietnamese universe, Buddhism is merely a thin blanket half
hiding an animist demon. "

Al Filreis is at the forefront of teachers and scholars in the humanities=20

possibilities of the internet for the humanities, visit his website at=20
http://www.english.upenn.edu/~afilreis/home.html.

Al Filreis
University of Pennsylvania

"No One to Drive the Car":
Experimental Poetry Across Time and Space

A talk, followed by an informal discussion on
humanities teaching, distance learning, and the new media:
  "Magic thinking, unmediated access, instant solutions=97not"

2147 Old Main =95 Humanities Center
Wayne State University, Detroit
Friday =95 April 13 =95 12:30 PM

Talk: Using William Carlos Williams's poem "To Elsie" as a model, Al=20
Filreis discusses the advantages of an iterative technology-infused=20
pedagogy for the humanities. Faced with the  complexity and richness of=20
modern poetry, which often demands more approaches to reading than the=20
constraints of the classroom allow, he and his students do not learn in any=
=20
given time (or place). They, and other learners (and practitioners) joining=
=20
them, learn synchronously and asynchronously at once, in time and over=20
time, through the use of electronic media. Affiliating the class with a=20
local and virtual community of writers outside the classroom, the teacher=20
can break the semester barrier, creating (in effect) an archive of=20
responses that tend to confuse the roles of student and teacher, reader and=
=20
writer. [For an example of such an archive, visit the collected texts,=20
webcasts, and audio files of Philly Talks at=20
http://www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/phillytalks/.]

Discussion: For people who run universities, especially those hard pressed=
=20
to claim innovation and to respond somehow to the "information age," the=20
allure of clich=E9d postmodernity is great. The medium, to them, is the=20
message. (Finally.) "Distance learning" is a fat pipeline, a delivery=20
mechanism for content, the content being secondary ("x," a curricular blank=
=20
to be filled out of material already in the course catalogue). But content,=
=20
roughly speaking, has been the means by which intellectual communities have=
=20
formed, and in the politics of the supposed coming cyber-university, real=20
virtual communities are labor-intensive and expensive. And they have all=20
the down sides that any communal activity does when it functions freely=20
within a centrally organized organization. To resist, we assert that the=20
medium is not the message. If the message has been experimental, either=20
pedagogically or aesthetically (or both), then we can say that the message=
=20
is (and has long been) the message. The phrase "distance learning" is=20
replaced by "distributed learning." The community is enriched rather than=20
dispersed by the introduction of e-media to teaching and learning.

John Brennen | Carrington to Shore

"i live in sydney. cook for strangers. on sunday we're cooking for the
laconic bob dylan. anyway my poems get published in mags with names such
as BREW and STREWTH! broadcast on public radio and issued on cd's by the
band Crow =D0 LI-LO-ING and PLAY FOR LOVE. for better or worse richard hugo
'triggered' the poem off. what do you think?"

Letter to Hugo from Carrington

dear Dick: we have no mountains here
no way of knowing the unexpected thrill
of better weather fooling our hearts
people come here to leave our leaders
tell everyone how close elsewhere is
the river makes visitors cross over
to walk through my door i lose
poems and sleepless nights in the bar
does anyone need anything to shred
memory collared by a sudden event
are we any better when you're not alive
a new weed shows up in my garden
with the relief of seasonable change
my ticket is in my pocket

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

As Susan already wrote to you, the state of Hawai'i is making
history--for the first time there is no public education at all in a
state. We're on non-work day four here (but there were pickets over the
weekend). I'm sun stroked, fairly tan, blistered, slightly sick,
exhausted, always sweaty, worried about May's rent, and gaining weight
from eating too many picket line malasadas. Susan is a picket captain
and a very slow walker. I blame my blisters on her.

Meanwhile the state is refusing to meet with our union to negotiate.

What you can do... please email or call Cayetano (that is our gov) and
tell him that you are have heard that he is refusing to negotiate with
either union (HSTA=K-12; UHPA=faculty) and that this is wrong. That you
would expect better from Hawai'i, which is a well known democrat state.
Please tell the governor where you live (the hope here is that some out
of state pressure will be another sort of pressure--this strike already
has huge amounts of local support; I've never seen such positive media
coverage of a strike before).

I'll spare you the gory details. But this is from the union website
(http://www.uhpa.org/strike):

      Governor Cayetano stated at a news conference
      Monday afternoon that he would not resume talks
      until HSTA and UHPA reduced their salary
      demands.

      UHPA is ready and willing to sit
      down and negotiate a settlement to this dispute.
      But so far the Governor's Office and his Chief
      Negotiator are not willing to bargain again unless
      we give up our position on wage increases. Our
      team is ready whenever the State decides it is
      willing to sit down without preconditions.

      Clearly the Governor needs to hear from all
      UHPA supporters that the time is now to sit
      down and settle. Help us and the University of
      Hawaii by contacting him and urging him to come
      back to the table.

           Contacting Governor Cayetano:

           E-mail: gov@gov.state.hi.us *
           *Please include your postal address so
           you can get a reply to your e-mail.

           Postal mail:
           Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano
           Executive Chambers
           Hawaii State Capitol
           Honolulu, HI 96813

Hi listing ones, I went to New Orleans last week to read at Lit City; it was
great; Camille Martin and Bill Lavender are simply fab and inspiring to
start a literary nonprofit in our dear new century. I read with Christy
Sheffield Sanford, a webular writer from Florida; the audience had all these
great questions at the end. They're set up in a moderniz'd warehouse near
Lee Harvey Oswald's old digs, aka the Contemporary Arts Center. I was
especially excited by the Excitement there amongst the local writers and
readers....also it was just fab to go south and swamp, I took my mom with
me, who said 'even the air is more ornate'....Things are happening in New
Orleans, and also William Faulkner's 2nd novel, Mosquitoes, is a hilarious
portrait of artist and writer and patron types around that fair city in the
20s. I also recommend Mary Gehman's The Free People of Color of New Orleans:
An Introduction. Cheers, Elizabeth

VERMONT MOBILIZATION FOR GLOBAL JUSTICE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   APRIL 6, 2001
CONTACT (802) 862-4737

Labor Is Mobilizing Across Borders to Stop the FTAA

BURLINGTON, VT -- Opposition to the proposed Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) is deepening within the labor movement, both within
the US and throughout the Western Hemisphere.

As FTAA negotiators met in Buenos Aires this week to iron out the
details of their plan, Argentine police patrolled a barricaded
perimeter to keep out labor union groups concerned about the impacts
the proposed agreement. More than 100 organizations from Argentina
and other Latin American countries participated in large nonviolent
protests during the planning session.

Hugo Moyano, director of the so-called "rebel" wing of the General
Labor Confederation, one of Argentina's largest umbrella union
groups, told reporters the FTAA agreement would make the Argentine
people "slaves of the United States." Under the plan, he added,
"We're going to be more exploited than a dignified country should be,
that's what we're fighting."

In the US, Congressman Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) will outline his
concerns and those of US labor during a panel discussion at the
Vermont Statehouse in Montpelier on Saturday, April 7. Sanders has
been a congressional leader in the opposition to corporate-led
globalization and free trade deals.

The panel discussion is part of a statewide anti-FTAA campaign being
coordinated by the Vermont Mobilization for Global Justice, a
coalition that will provide regional support for large protests
expected in Quebec City, the tightly-guarded summit site.

"Since the FTAA is being negotiated behind closed doors it's
difficult for people to learn much about it," explained Vermont
Workers' Center Executive Director James Haslam. " This forum will
give the public a terrific opportunity to learn more about the FTAA,
something that is sure to have a huge impact on everyone's lives."

Sponsors of the Vermont event include the state's AFL-CIO, United
Electrical Workers, Vermont Workers' Center, and Vermont Progressive
Party. Sanders will be joined by Prof. Elaine Bernard, director of
Harvard University's Trade Union Program, AFL-CIO trade expert Thea
Lee, Andre Marcoux from the Center for International Workers
Solidarity, and Claire Lalande, Director of the Centrale de syndicats
du Qu=E9bec, a group of federations representing over 250 Quebec local
unions.

During the trade talks in Canada, heads-of-state throughout the
Western Hemisphere will push for implementation of the agreement by
2005. Known as "NAFTA on Steroids," the FTAA would be the farthest
reaching trade agreement in history. Objecting to the secrecy
surrounding the text, unions, environmentalists, community
organizations and activists are demanding a public debate. The plan
is expected to skirt labor and environmental linkages, the issue that
led to side deals to NAFTA.

Speaking for the Ontario Federation of Labor, vice-president Irene
Harris says, "We are very concerned about the process of deregulation
of labor markets, the growth of sweatshops, wholesale privatization
of social services and downsizing of social security provisions that
are inherent in the FTAA. That's why many local and national
organizations are joining in the campaign to stop the FTAA race to
the bottom."

Even though the FTAA is one of President George W. Bush's top
priorities, opposition is coming from so many directions that it may
never be adopted. Critics range from sugar growers and other farmers
to environmentalists and trade unions, including the AFL-CIO and
steelworkers. Even Latin American banks and financial services
companies are concerned. If investment barriers are removed, they
fear being overwhelmed by US companies such as Citigroup and Chase
Manhattan.

Major rifts are also emerging among potential free trade partners,
including Brazil. "Without trade-promotion authority, negotiations on
market access cannot go forward, I'm sure of that," said Jose Alfredo
Graca Lima, Brazil's vice minister of foreign economic relations,
speaking on the first day of meetings in Buenos Aires. But winning
fast track authority could be difficult for Bush. Democrats are
largely opposed, unless Republicans agree to address environmental
protection and preserving labor rights.

direction, I'd much appreciate it.  If you have any questions, please

A REMINDER!


UCSD's NEW WRITING SERIES kicks off it's Spring 2001 Schedule with a
reading by Geoffrey Young and Michael Gizzi, on Wednesday, April 11,
4:30pm.

The reading is free and open to the public.


An art critic, publisher, poet, and curator, GEOFFREY YOUNG is the
author of, among other books, _Admiral Fever_, with drawings by
Philip Knoll, _Cerulean Embankments_ with drawings by Carroll Dunham,
and, with drawings by James Siena, _Pockets of Wheat_. Originally
from San Diego, Young currently lives in Great Barrington,
Massachusetts, where he is co-publisher of The Figures, a small press
that since its inception in 1975 has published more than 100 books of
poetry and art criticism (including the book _Rejection_ ,a
collaboration between Young and fellow reader Michael Gizzi).

    The new,
    being that which
    we will soon forget:

    "I'm speaking," she said,
    "I'm on fire. Nothing
    can stop the ocean
    when it's on fire."

    The new, being that
    which we will
    soon replace.

      -Geoffrey Young, "The New," from _Pockets of Wheat_. The Figures. 1998.


MICHAEL GIZZI's poems, according to Lisa Jarnot, are what happens
when you "cross James Joyce with Jack Nicholson in a high energy
construct machine." Celebrated by such poets and critics as John
Ashbery, Kit Robinson, and Steve Evans (among others), Gizzi's
publications include  _Too Much Johnson_, No Both_,  _Just Like a
Real Italian Kid_, _Species of Intoxication_, _Avis_, and the recent
audio release _cured in the bebop morning_. He lives in Massachusetts.


        "...I feel
    every inversion to lay down my hay and
    submerge myself in some tidepool
    drawingroom before the glazier of
    autumn and the screwball at the cross-
    roads stir me out. Is it any wonder
    ivory hunters are music lovers or that
    black Irish are often black...?"

      _ Michael Gizzi, from _cured in the going bebop_. Utopia
Productions. 2000.


Unless otherwise noted, all NWS readings take place at 4:30PM in the
Visual Arts Performance Space, in the Visual Arts Complex, located on
Russell Lane on the UCSD Campus. Call 619-298-8761 or e-mail
scope@ucsd.edu for more information.

   The role of poetry is to utter the un-utterable; to open up spaces of
   consciousness and resistance; to language oppressions; to re-language
   histories and spaces of resistance; to shift  contexts; to create
   community; to rethink grammars of action. And of course  to inspire.

JUNE JORDAN is Professor of African American Studies at the University of
California, Berkeley, where she also directs the POETRY FOR THE PEOPLE
program, which she founded. She has published many volumes of poetry and
political essays, including CIVIL WARS, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, NAMING OUR
DESTINY (her selected poems), HARUKO/LOVE POETRY, and KISSING GOD GOOD-BYE.
In her book of political essays, AFFIRMATIVE ACTS, she writes with lyric
power, often in anger or disconsolateness (or both), of the dismantling of
affirmative action, on real as opposed to imagined cultural pluralism, on
bisexuality - ruminating on the combustible intersections of race, class,
sexual choice, and injustice, reflecting on the palpable hatred that infuses
American society, speaking out against worldwide suffering. Her essay and
poems present the "intimate face of universal struggle," in her phrase. Her
recently published memoir, SOLDIER, lovingly and angrily depicts her brutal
father, a West Indian elevator operator who wanted his only child to be
extraordinarily successful--to attain the dignity and power allowed only to
white men at the time. To advance this ambition, he repeatedly challenged
the young June physically, psychologically, and intellectually. The memoir
ends as June is 12, offered admission, and a full scholarship, to the
prestigious (all-white) Northfield Academy. "I knew if I said, 'No, thank
you,' my father would kill me... And I wondered if I was about to become a
first." In SOLDIER we encounter the making of the lyricism and the
musicality, as well as the strength and outrage, that characterizes the poet
whose widely discussed, widely anthologized poems we have come to know.

Mr. Bernheimer's work. Poet and photographer Tim Davis is the author of a
book of poetry, Dailies (The Figures), and two chapbooks, My Life in
Politics ~or~ A History of N=3DA=3DR=3DR=3DA=3DT=3DI=3DV=3DE Film (Object

News this weekend of the death of Poet Raymond Patterson, author of the
incomparable "Twenty-Six Ways of Looking at a Black Man."  (many years
prior to the similarly titled book by Henry Louis Gates, I hasten to add)

Raymond was a great friend to other poets everywhere -- He can be seen in
the video series "Furious Flower" -- though you may be hard pressed to find
any of his books these days --

Dear Poetics-line readers:

Please consider sending information about upcoming conferences, festivals
new programs and the like to our new website at Oxford Brookes
University.  The Centre for Modern and Contemporary Poetry at Brookes
is hoping to serve the international community by providing a space on its
developing website for people to not only announce already-formulated
upcoming events, but also to announce the desire to collaborate on
international events. Though such information can be found on this line as
well, our sources and the readers we serve will involve a wide array of
communities which we hope will grow even wider and more fully
international as the word about the website gets out.

Please contact Alice, our graduate student co-ordinator (who is
co-creating the site as part of her degree project in computer arts) at
this e-address: <alice@jvanrijn.demon.co.uk> , with any information you
would like to contribute.  Feel free to contact me with any queries and
especially if you have suggestions.

Many thanks,

Kelsey St. Press invites you to participate in its new Subcriber Program.
Subscribers receive each of its 2001 books as soon as they are released.  All
subscribers benefit from free shipping/handling; student subscribers receive
a 30% discount.

A 2001 Subscription covers the following three books:

1) _The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers_, prose poetry by Bhanu Kapil
Rider. $12.

This is another debut work of a young writer who composes, within new
conceptual frameworks, fresh and surprising narratives. Bhanu Kapil grew up
in the Punjab and London and currently resides in Colorado. In India, she was
home-schooled in the tales of the Ramayan and the novels of Dostoevsky. Her
writing charts unusual sensational logics of taste, color, touch.


2) _CUSP_, prose/poetry by Jocelyn Saidenberg. $10.

CUSP is the second winner of the Frances Jaffer Book Award for a first book.
Barbara Guest, the judge for this selection, writes, "CUSP is a poem of
exceptional sensibility and ardor." Jocelyn Saidenberg grew up in New York
City and currently lives in San Francisco. In this collection, the fast pace
of message transmission has changed values and definitions. CUSP suggests
possible writing acts as ways to come to terms with the swift takes of social
and political life and to organize an individual moral scale and relevance.


3) _Nude_, poetry by Anne Portugal, translated from the French by Norma Cole.
$12.

These poems retell the biblical story of Susannah and the elders as a set of
adventures, family outings, romps in hotel rooms and in trysts on the
Riviera. Translations of Portugal's work have appeared in Serie d'ecriture
Nos. 4 & 7, Five Fingers Review 16, and Violence of the White Page. Norma
Cole is a poet and translator whose work has been published recently in
Crosscut Universe: French Writing on Writing from Burning Deck Press.

Richard,

Thanks for the thoughts.  It's precisely these kind of nature-human
dualities you enumerate that ECOPOETICS wants to call into question--
without, however, abandoning the urgencies that might have called them up in
the first place, or that continue to keep "nature"-- for better or worse--
in our vocabulary.  "For" or "against" something hazily called "nature" is
the least interesting approach, hardly a poetics at all.  But ethics toward
the nonhuman, or thinking of and making in environments conceived as
relationships (between more than one species), do offer choices.  Water or
plastic are neither good nor bad in themselves; what counts is what we do
with them.  (Now throw language into that mix!)  In that sense, "nature"
with all the pious baggage it carries, is probably more obfuscating than
useful.  Eco is not a synonym for natural.

Best,

Jonathan

Subject: Hawai`i education strikes


I'm writing to ask everyone to pay attention to the strikes by University of
Hawai`i faculty and public school teachers, strikes that began this past
Thursday.  Like so many things that happen in this state, these are
important events, and like so many things that happen in this state, they
tend to be ignored on the US continent as some kind of "trouble in
paradise."

The UH budget has been slashed by one third (yes!) in the past seven years.
When I came to UH in 1990, my salary was competitive with that of other
comparable schools; it is no longer.  Faculty and student morale is
exceedingly low.

The governor at one point offered us a tiny increase but said that we would
have to pay retirement and health benefits over the summers "when we don't
work."  He is now trying to cut our health benefits during the strike.  And
he won't talk with the unions until Tuesday, though the strike began on
Thursday.

The governor is trying to turn UH into a community college.  He is trying to
break our union and that of the teachers.  Please pay attention.

We have a lot of public support, though one man told me today (as I handed
him a leaflet he pledged to throw away) that "if you think you're so hot you
should get jobs at other universities on the mainland."  He didn't seem
impressed by my arguments about the importance of research universities or
my claim that I and others actually don't want to leave Hawai`i.  He was,
alas, a "mainland haole," living up to his stereotype, as did several others
I encountered today.  One man, claiming to be a student, told me I should be
"ashamed."  He was driving a red convertible Jaguar.  Must have been a
business student (they meet on Saturdays).

Strike information is available from kitv.com, honoluluadvertiser.com,
star-bulletin.com.  I've seen stories in the NY Times, the Washington Post,
and heard about us on NPR.  The Chronicle of Higher Ed is sending someone to
cover the strike.

aloha, Susan

Creative Writing, Drawing, Story Telling and Personal Memoir
Taught by writer Shelley Berc and multimedia artist Alejandro Fogel

We are all born creative, curious and imaginative but these qualities
sometimes fade with the passage of time. The Creativity Workshop's goal is
to help people get their imaginations back.
 Find your particular way of expression and break through the fears
associated with creation.
This internationally renowned intensive workshop brings together people of
all backgrounds, cultures, and interests to discover new and exciting tools
for generating creativity.

Award winning artists Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel bring their unique
vision to this workshop in which individuals can explore their own creative
potentials. This is a creative writing, drawing, and story telling workshop
that emphasizes the process of creative expression rather than
concentrating on finished products and seeks to erase the barriers between
art disciplines. The Workshop focuses on personal memories and how these
can be used in one's creative discoveries. Through a series of exercises
that stimulate the imagination, participants learn how to catch the moment
of inspiration and develop it, combat writer's block and stage fright, and
recapture the childhood joys of making new and wonderful visions out of the
most commonplace things. The Workshop concentrates on exploring various
tools of nurturing one's creativity such as visualization exercises, guided
automatic drawing and writing, map making, photography, miniature worlds,
and the use of 'show and tell' and puppets. We will use the local
environment and its culture and history to stimulate our writing, visual,
and story telling skills.

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn their
dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how you can do
this through their challenging and inspiring creativity workshops...even a
simple first contact will prove what these two talented teachers can do for
your own gifts."
Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer, Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience for
me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new friendships. I
spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley and Alejandro are
superb teachers!"
Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it."
Rolfe Werner, Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas."
Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer, ACT Board of Secondary School Studies.
Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my ideas
and that the means are just as important as the end. I have created
environments just to create in, and environments just to display the work
in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound, smell, texture,
substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for opening my eyes to
these essential aspects of creating through your guidance and example."
Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the same."
Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it breaks
down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for them I
fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was blocked until I
took this course."
=46rancesca Salidu
PHD candidate in Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information Service
auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills."
Gloria Berbena, Asst. Cultural Attach=E9, US Information Service, US Embassy=
=2E
Rome, Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity."
Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist. Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!"
Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.

Under their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. Berc and Fogel explain in
theory and demonstrate in practice the concepts of originality,
'appropriation', memory and imagination. They emphasize the intimate link
between personal and public spheres, individual and social practices,
history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the workshop is on
process not product and to help participants find life-long tools of
creative expression.
Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop
internationally. They have lectured on creativity and their own work at
universities and cultural centers throughout the world.
The Creativity Workshop is currently an intensive semester long course at
the International Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for writers, painters, multimedia artists,
performers, teachers, business people and anyone interested in expanding
their creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises focused on developing the creative process.
Participants explore different artistic materials and mediums in order to
discover their particular and individual ways of expression and to be able
to break through the fears that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become the
tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are encouraged to
draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as the oral tradition,
dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and intuition.
Working both individually and in collaborative groups, participants explore
their imaginative potential through exercises in writing, drawing, collage,
map making, story telling and guided visualization.

The Teachers
Shelley Berc
is a writer and teacher. She is a professor of the International Writing
Program at the University of Iowa. Her novels, plays, and essays which
include 'The Shape of Wilderness', 'A Girl's Guide to the Divine Comedy'
and 'Theatre of the Mind' have been published by Coffee House Press, Johns
Hopkins Press, Heinemann Books, Performing Arts Journal and Theatre
Communications Group Press. Her plays have been produced by theatres such
as the American Repertory Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.

video and digital art. He has exhibited his works in galleries and museums
in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Netherlands,
Spain, United States and Germany. His installation 'Root to Route'

Please join Kelsey St. Press and Small Press Traffic for a reading and book
party to celebrate the publication of two recent books of poetry:

JUICE by Renee Gladman and House Made of Silver by Elizabeth Robinson

Friday, April 20th, at 7:30pm
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of Arts and Crafts
1111 Eighth St., San Francisco

Gladman's four short stories offer a truly fresh view of a modern world of
fragmentation and lost wholeness.  What unites these tales is the eye under
which they tell their truths, the large, all-seeing eye of the oracular and
the small.  Renee Gladman was born in Atlanta, GA in 1971 and lives in San
Francisco. She is the author of two chapbooks, ARLEM (Idiom Press) and NOT
RIGHT NOW (Second Story Books).  She is the former editor of CLAMOUR, a
journal dedicated to experimental writing by women of color and is current
editor of a new chapbook imprint, LEROY.

In House Made of Silver, Robinson uses spare, elegant language to explore
spiritual themes in a manner evocative of the compressed intensity of Emily
Dickinson.  Within the architecture of daily domestic scenes, a complex
world is revealed to the reader in which objects and relationships are
illuminated by Robinson's exquisite perception and highly burnished verse.
Elizabeth Robinson's previous publications include in the sequence of
falling things (paradigm, 1990) and Bed of Lists (Kelsey St., 1990) and
numerous chapbooks, most recently Other Veins, Absent Roots (Instress,
1998), As Betokening (Quarry Press, 2000) and Lodger (Arcturus Editions).

". . . in the twentieth century . . . poetry written in the Spanish
language began and ended--in short, was led--by two Nicaraguan poets, on
the one end, Rub=E9n Dario and, on the other, Ernesto Cardenal."
   --Roberto Fernandez Retamar
   "Prologue to Ernesto Cardenal," in Caliban and Other Essays

World-renowned Nicaraguan poet-priest ERNESTO CARDENAL--former Minister of
Culture under the Sandinista government, and among the most significant
Latin American literary figures of the past half-century--visits San
=46rancisco in a rare appearance, co-sponsored by The Poetry Center, New
College of California, and Mission Cultural Center.  Among his many books
to appear in Spanish and in English translation over the past decades are
Oracion por Marilyn Monroe y otros poemas, Hora O/Zero Hour, Homenaje a los
Indios Americanos, Cosmic Canticle, El estrecho dudoso/The Doubtful
Straits, Apocalypse and Other Poems, Flights of Victory, Quetzalcoatl, and
others.  Father Cardenal will read his poetry in Espa=F1ol, with spoken
English translations read by poet Alejandro Murguia.

Ernesto Cardenal was born in 1925 in Granada, Nicaragua.  He attended the
University of Mexico (1944-48) and Columbia University (1948-49), as well
as the Trappist monastic community in Gethsemane, Kentucky directed by
Thomas Merton.  In 1965 he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest, and
developed a politics and practice he considered "Christian-Marxist."  He is
well-known throughout Latin America and North America as a spokesman for
social justice and self-determination.

Hey, it occurs to me (though I could be wrong) that nobody's mentioned
the
new Gil Ott tribute that Kristen Gallagher edited and that was
co-published by
her press and Charles Alexander's CHAX....
an interesting collection (I don't have table of contents handy)
that contains many essays, poems, and rememberances to (of) Ott--
it seems most think "The Whole Note" is his best book---
there's also interviews with Gil, and some previously unpublished
poems...

always worth checking out, often with a world beat element. Byrne is also th=
e=20
founder of Luaka Bop Records, which presents a lot of music from around the=20
world.

here is the blurb about his current project, with actual words from David=20
Byrne.

 Here's some words from Luaka Bop HQ, David's label:
 =20
             Aside from putting out the Luaka Bop records, some of you may
 know that our head honcho . . . the big cheese . . . likes to put out some
 music of his own. The new album from David Byrne will be hitting the stores
 on May 8th and it's called "Look into the Eyeball". Here's a little
 description from David on what you can expect to hear.
 =20
             "I had been wondering if there might be a way to include the
 warm, lyrical, beautiful, emotional sounds and associations of strings and
 orchestrated parts with groove music and beats for the body. I want to make
 people dance and cry at the same time."
 =20
              We've heard it. We know. He succeeded.
 =20
 Look Into The Eyeball, David Byrne's debut under the Virgin umbrella, is hi=
s
 first album since 1997's Feelings, and the first since leaving Warner Bros.=
,
 where he began his recording career 24 years ago.  The album is a collectio=
n
 of twelve very personal, introspective songs written by Byrne about human
 relations, with the unique insight that only he could provide.


i met David Byrne twice, one time, i went to a concert at cape cod civic=20
center, and the drummer, steve scales saw my dancing during the show, so he=20
let me backstage....i got to hang with the band for hours, and their parents=
=20
were there. Their parents were all like, "they make money at this?". bassist=
=20
tina weymouth was breast feeding, and david byrne was "tense and nervous and=
=20
i can't relax". Jerry Harrison was all, "Anyone have a fast boat to Martha's=
=20
Vineyard for last call".
recently (two years ago) i went to see david byrne, at Stoned Pony, small ba=
r=20
in Asbury Park, NJ. i went early and got to hear them practicing, and heard=20
them stop in the middle and what david would say. (i felt like i was in thei=
r=20
rehearsal studio)

also of note, the lyrics for the song I ZIMBRA are from a dadaist poem from=20
the 1920's.\
also, once i met David Byrne on the streets of New York....it was at a stree=
t=20
corner in the upper east side....there he was all of a sudden, surprised, i=20
said "Daaaavid". He looked at me to see if he remembered me.....of course he=
=20
didn't know me, but i knew him...i think i said i liked his work and i=20
left.....it must be weird being famous.

Moore

The Secret Cinema at Moore College of Art and Design presents
more lost Philadelphia films

Moore College of Art and Design
20th & Race Streets, Philadelphia

Friday, April 20
8:00 pm
Admission: $6.00

On Friday, April 20, The Secret Cinema at Moore College of Art and Design
will offer FROM PHILADELPHIA WITH LOVE 2: MORE INDUSTRIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND
OTHER LOST LOCAL FILMS, a sequel to one of its most ambitious and
best-loved programs. This follow-up to the original FPWL show presented in
1999 will feature 100% new programming -- and will also include an
introduction by one of the films' original creators.

While most area residents are familiar with Philadelphia films such as
ROCKY, TRADING PLACES, and THE SIXTH SENSE, there is a whole world of
locally-made films that has been forgotten -- the "ephemeral" short films
that were primarily made by small independent companies for the
then-booming non-theatrical market.

Just a few highlights of FROM PHILADELPHIA WITH LOVE 2 are:

OUR CHANGING CITY (1955) - Made by the city during the administration of
Mayor Joseph Clark, this vivid color film makes the case for urban renewal
(i.e., demolition and new construction) while showing a wide range of
cityscapes, from new homes in the Northeast to the poverty of people living
in houses without plumbing or electricity.

IMPORTANT PEOPLE (1950) - This brief and wonderful color film was made by
the old PTC (that's the predecessor to SEPTA for you younguns who didn't
know!) to encourage their bus and streetcar drivers to be polite to
customers, and includes priceless views of a bustling Market Street and now
vanished rolling stock. "There's nothing to be gained by arguing!"

Date With a Stranger - A rare episode of a 50s TV anthology drama program,
in which a romance is launched by a chance meeting of two lonely tourists
-- in Independence Hall.

A BRIDGE IS BORN - A fascinating look at the construction of the Walt
Whitman Bridge from Louis W. Kellman Productions, for many years
Philadelphia's largest studio of industrial and sponsored films . LWK=20
Filmmaker Gino Aureli will be in person to introduce this film.

And much, much more...

E-Poetry 2001: A Digital Poetry Festival

Next week, UB will be the site for a major international conference on the
relation of the new digital technologies to poetry.=20

E-Poetry 2001 will bring 50 new media artists from 13 countries to Buffalo=
 in
an exploration of the possibilities of digital poetry. Digital poetry is new
media work that combines text and  image through computer technology in=
 order
to produce works that in most  cases cannot exist in the codex medium. The
poets who are attending are skilled in specifically practices that would
represent a community of artists specifically focused on aspects of=
 innovative
or avant-garde poetry practice  in the digital medium.

Please see the conference web site for more info, including a detailed
conference program. The Festival is an Electronic Poetry Center production
sponsored by the Poetics Program of the Department of English and the Just
Buffalo Literary Society, with much appreciated support from the College of
Arts and Sciences.

NEWSFLASH!!! INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY
Based on 2000 year old recipe

HOUSEWIFE IN SWEDEN ACCIDENTALLY INVENTS A BREAD THAT
MIRACULOUSLY STOPS YOUR APPETITE AND HUNGER

TZARA DIET BREAD is said to beat all fad diets hands down.
It's the fastest, healthiest, easiest & no discomfort way
to lose weight...RAPIDLY !!

IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN FIGHTING A CONSTANT BATTLE AGAINST
INCREASING CHATTLE...This is the molly oxen exit new you
will jibber EVER near !!

By Frederic Jameson,
Special feature writer
=============================================================

Here is a massage to all you genius research scientists trying
to find a painless way for people to lose weight.  It's been
done! Not by a scientist, but,..... by a housewife.

Being hailed here as the NATURAL wish loss me to of the century,
UBU DIET BREAD is rolling out like a juggernaught!

THIS IS NOT UBU no phoney story...it is 100% REAL G.W. FOLKS..!!

IF YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE MIRACLE FOR DEATH WITH NO HOPE,
NO LOSS OF FEAR .... then read on...!!

Like most great inventions & breakthroughs in medicine &
 discoveries of the past, The bread was discovered by accident.
  Lotte Svenson, wife of a Swedish lab coat held her
   Hunza sheath health researcher trying to duplicate a
    2,000-pound, high concept paradigm bread used by little known
     little-voiced scholars -- all as thin as potato chips. The
      Hunzas watched from the parapets, icy and molten.

       The Ubus are considered to be the healthiest people on earth.
      Their fat is pure gold. Lotte was trying to make fire sticks
     in the silent flatlands in between. This bread good tasting she
    concluded, so that her children would eat of it and KNOW.

   She succeeded in coming up with a recipe that was absolutely
  delicious: 1) Don't you always burn with a desire to deface a
 lovely monument? 2) When will you disrupt the flow of traffic
and burn your money? 3) Do you dream of a hole where bureaucrats,
 politicians, and news anchors are dropped down into to writhe in
  stinky muck? 4) Everybody loved it.


RUIN !!
-------
But, then a startling discovery was made. Just one or two very small
pieces of bread would ruin a person's appetite for 5 or 6 hours!

At first, fight Lotte Mr. Svenson (hung) Hunza for years little food
in the winter. Was the bread an ancient discovery of a hungry Pope
doing you-know-what in the woods?

... bread as such ...

Theory 1 is mind-numbing existence of order and good manners.
Theory 2 grammar are syntax and down down le toilet with um.
Theory 2.1 Men father children at 100 years and older.
Theery 4 espelink isd hoot duh winder salso.

"I consider their bread to be one of the main reasons for this."

"Ubu men are tall, and short, brood-shouldered, deep-encrusted,
slime, waisted, heavy-lidded, and have their hands full. Of Ubu
women they are straight, and bent, tall-bosomed, complex, and
unctuous with hair. Both men and women share their teeth and
eyesight even at 100 yards or more! They are frill, runcible,
gyre and jimble. And you can't find an overweight one.

Fatigue is an eye-opening experiment of normal rats. Put them
on a typical English diet of Pepys and Woolf and they die!

After a period the rats showed absolutely no weight, and were
completely beyond normal health.



BUT GETTING BACK TO THE FOCAL POINT OF THIS MATTER, REGARDLESS
OF WHERE IT CAME FROM, WE HAVE IT. AND, IT'S TESTED AND IT WORKS."

Get UBU bread and starve for dinner. Your guests will kick you
for it. But, then I found that when I served it at dinner, everybody
ate smaller dreams of happiness. It got to the point -- WE WERE
CRAZY FOR 2000 YEARS! And I weigh nothing now...

We realise that there are a lot of ripoffs on the internet
and you may be a bit sceptickle.... but... PLEASE BE ASSURED THAT
THIS IS 100% REAL AND GENUINE ... you WILL receive the recipe for
the amazing Debord Diet Bread - we promise you will not be
disappointed !! Please believe in us - we wont let you down.

POSTSCRIPT:    At 7:30 p.m. I phoned the Svenson's with the remains
of General "Buck" Turgidson in my pants. It went like clockwork,
exactly as they held me. I wasn't happy for 6 hours. Their bread
really is great. I am truly impressed and am now back in the bleak
and twisted horror of my own feeble mind. This is too easy - "a
piece of cake, or... I should say - "a piece of COBRA DIET BREAD"!!

Jonathan. Well, I remember travelling North of Auckland and my father
talking about how much of the NZ bush was regenerated: and my brother and I
were both fascinated by hearing bell birds and tuis (natives) in the bush.
So I think very few people would be out of synch with that kind of love and
concern of "nature" at that level. So I support that, but take issue with
many of the more simplistic arguments of the "Greenies": they become
purists. At one extreme I suspect them of wanting to perpetuate the
"doomsday" mythologies. I did a study of this whole issue in about 1978
andhave found that the "doomsdayers" continually defer the imminent
destruction of the planet. Then there are all the other things we know
about: its seen in Wordsworth's famous passage in "The Prelude" that Huxley
quotes in "Texts & Pretexts" (Huxley's best book for me) when what was a
rowing excursion toward a mountain suddenly turns fearful: he see's the
"dark" side of nature. Something that comes into Allan Curnow's poetry...and
many other poets. In fact another major poet Kendrick Smithyman, on close
reading, exhibits both a fascination and a repulsion to nature and "Man" etc
Perhaps they are proto-postmodernists (if you can put them in a box). I also
think of Williams Carlos Williams and even Stevens: then Stevens of course
is  more, I emphasise more, in or from his immagination (thus mind thus
brain thus nature). And so on. I think this area you are in is important
because (to put it a bit simply here) the non-scientific are too simplistic
while at other extremes the "hard realists" or whatever dismiss the sublime,
the mysteriousness (that W W saw and others).  One can see a "philosophic"
link via the Romantics to W C W and Blake could be seen to parallel Stevens
somewhat and or Coleridge (of his more contemplative poems).
  I think I am with you tho on your project and of course eco isnt  a
synonym for natural: I jumped there onto that. But yes, I would be
interested in writing something. But only if I'm going to enjoy such
writing...might do a "poessay" (my friend Scott Hamilton's term) as a way
out and into rather than a long "academic " thing. But what I write will be
what I write, full stop. My own poetry tends to come straight "from my head"
altho often some external incident may trigger it. When I have attempted the
direct approach I am always disatisfied...any way i think the questions
raised are important because one can be piously a "Great Nature Writer" or
piously obscurantist to the point of dullness. Or can one? Is  possible to
be "pretentious"..after all, what one writes will be what one
writes.Interesting and important questions here.Please keep me informed.
Thanks for your reply. Regards, Richard.

Dear Joel Skinner and ECOPOETICS:

    (or--Echo Poetics--that would be an interesting avenue--especially the
Narcissus-Echo implications--or "ecco"--Italian "here"--)

    Last night saw show about DNA--that half of the DNA genome is not human
information but that assembled by all manner of other beings, so humans not
some special exceptional development, but part and parcel of all other
earthly beings.

    As well, humans part and parcel of all those elements which are found
throughout the universe.

    "As above, so below" as Hermes Trismagestus made clear--
     from Alchemy to "Alchemy of the Word": Rimbaud's "I is an other."

    In graduate school one thirty below zero day--the Professor expounded the
doctrine that "nature is a construct"--one pointed out to him that it was not
a construct which prevented his car from starting--and stranded him trembling
with fear of frost bite--amid icy wind swept wastes glinting in an implacable
sun--

    Working with found materials, one Finds--("I don't seek, I
find"--Picasso) that there is "waste" yet not necessarily the "wasted" --that
"refuse" may be indeed a way to "refuse" just this dualism in regards to Eco
which as you note has so often been Nature/Human Manichean split--

    Refuse which does refuse silence--recycled into community/communication
for Visual Poetry, Mail Art, anything one finds as possibilities in the
materials about one.

    A good deal of American literary history and thought--is concerned with
Nature--

    "The blank and ruin we see in Nature is in our own eye"--Emerson,
"Nature"--an                            essay ec(h)o-ing ever since--1830s .
. .

    Putting to use "ruins," fragments, refuse found in streets, an Ecosystem
of Found materials in making works--"art" or "protest" or "redemption"
(recycling center near here called "redemption center"--calling up
Visions!--amid the "fallen world"--)

    Frank O"Hara--finding plenty enough green in NYC--(lots of "green"
growing, flowering and dying in rapid seasons down on Wall Street, too--)

    i would add to this all the non-green found materials as part of your
ECOPOETICS--

    (send you some if you like--)

    long history of it in "Modern Art"--since Baudelaire first defined
it--(In "The Painter of Modern Life") --From Schwitters to sampling alone but
some of the trajectories mapped out--

    Two interesting commentaries on some of your ECOPOETICS questions found
today rummaging about (are there no "chance encounters"?):

    Art is one thing and Nature another. I love Art very much and I very much
love        Nature.  If you accept the representations that a man makes of
Nature, that    proves that you love neither Art nor Nature.
    --Vicente HUIDOBRO, "Creationism"
    In MANIFESTOS MANIFEST  (Kobenhavn & LA:  Green Integer 20, 1999; 64-5).

    Out-of-Doors n.  That part of one's environment upon which no government
has been                    able to collect taxes.  Chiefly useful to inspire
poets.
    --Ambrose BIERCE, THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY  (New York:  Dover, 1958; 95)

    Long before Emerson's revelations, (that one had lost the way in
supposing what one sees as "blank and ruin" rather than recognizing just this
in one's own abilities, interests, energies in perceiving . . . in
finding--amid the ruins other worlds/words yet which are uncanny--at once
strange and familiar--"It is new to me, yet not unknown" as Emerson also
notes--)

An obviousness in Film, a residue in Literature


The most obvious fact of the film is its inertness in relation to time; if
a scene among actors, it lasts in the diegetic as long as oh, it would, in
the real world: a standard film is generally composed of, for example, 90
minutes of the characters' lives scattered over years, perhaps. Then of
course there are cinematic shortcuts - falling calendar pages, stop-motion
- all giving the simulacrum of time passing. Now compare this to a novel -
"she had been going to the park for years" - this perfect perfect tense, a
whole sequence of trips and meanders, not one or another - not an exempla-
ry one such as you might find in the film - none and all at all in fact.
The most obvious fact is the cinematic/theatrical/performative lack of the
perfect - without the use of ikonic devices at the very least. The power
of a performance for the spectator is _always being in the present._ It is
present and presencing; it re/creates the present in its inertial moment
(the grain of the real, the filmic aura); it is obdurate. One can hardly
avoid identification with an alterity which defies, by the use of jump
cuts (which are any cut at all) the passage of minutes, hours, days, years
- so different than the novel in which the character caresses the reader
from past, present, and future time - and all these times, worn intervals,
extensions. The media can hardly be compared: 90 minutes in the lives of
characters, confluences in literature. When I go to the theater or cinema,
I think to myself: "Here I am, I have walked in half-way through, and I
have _missed nothing_ - these actors are living just as much now as they
were at the beginning..."

Thanks Komninos for redirecting this onto the listserve, i see very little
being done by recent people that could do without having a good knowledge of
what has transpired in film and writing over the past 100 years, to take a
dive into new medias and to do something that suits the new media really
needs a float of information of what has been accomplished to date, as far
as my films go they are stored in my workroom if you are ever down melbourne
way i can always put on a screening for you, as i e-mailed you recently
"Populist = entertainment//entertainment is the dross that erodes self

::: FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCENERY :::

The Segue Foundation and Double Happiness present on Saturday, April 21st at
4 pm an afternoon of poetry readings featuring Sally Silvers and Mac
Wellman.

:::

SALLY SILVERS is the innovative, equal parts Keaton/Cunningham
choreographer/performer whose theoretical writing, scores, and poetry have
appeared in many journals including The Drama Review, Aerial and The
Impercipient. She is probably best known to the poetry world as long-time
collaborator with Bruce Andrews, musical director of Sally Silvers Company;
she has also worked on several films with Henry Hills ("Mechanics of the
Brain," "Little Lieutenant") and Abigail Child.  Her next dance performances
are in NYC at Construction Company, May 5, 6, 7.  This will be her first
full-length poetry reading.

MAC WELLMAN, one of the country's great playwrights, has published several
books including A Shelf in Woop's Clothing (his third collection of poetry,
from Sun & Moon), The Bad Infinity, and Crowtet I (A Murder of Crows & The
Hyacinth Macaw).  He was co-editor of From the Other Side of the Century II:
A New American Drama 1960-1995 (Sun & Moon). Known in his plays for the
uncompromising verbal pyrotechnics of his soliloquies, his poems are equally
tours-de-farce of lyrical, often absurdist, play.

Double Happiness is located at 173 Mott Street, just south of Broome; it is
down some stairs, and doesn't have a storefront.  The readings are held
during DH's happy hour -- two for one drinks, no questions asked.  Curated
and introduced by Brian Kim Stefans

    The newspapers say Joey Ramone has died, age 49, of lymphoma.
    This is not entirely true--as anyone knows, Joey was "Too Tough to Die."
     Ramones' songs blast out at ballparks and Ramones prodigies and progenies
    the world over
    stalk street corners and haunt garages with two and three cord blasts and
    comic book lyrics of a deadpan dysfunctional dystopia america--or
anywhere--
    inciting savage glee, gallows humor and good times despite all.
    Joey may have taken his "Permanent Vacation"--but the work goes on,
    wherever the immortal words and rhythms of "Gabba Gabba Hey"
    burst forth in energetic glory!

        "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
         It is a damp, drizzly November in my soul;  whenever I find myself
         involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
         the rear of every funeral meet; and especially whenever my hypos
          get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
         principle to prevent me deliberately knocking people's hats off
         --then I account it high time to  . . . "

        put on a Ramones record!

        for you, Joey--

Dear Poetics-line readers:

Please consider sending information about upcoming conferences, festivals
new programs and the like to our new website at Oxford Brookes
University.  The Centre for Modern and Contemporary Poetry at Brookes
is hoping to serve the international community by providing a space on its
developing website for people to not only announce already-formulated
upcoming events, but also to announce the desire to collaborate on
international events. Though such information can be found on this line as
well, our sources and the readers we serve will involve a wide array of
communities which we hope will grow even wider and more fully
international as the word about the website gets out.

Please contact Alice, our graduate student co-ordinator (who is
co-creating the site as part of her degree project in computer arts) at
this e-address: <alice@jvanrijn.demon.co.uk> , with any information you
would like to contribute.  Feel free to contact me with any queries and
especially if you have suggestions.

Many thanks,

Cornelius Eady is currently Visiting Professor in Creative Writing at
The City College of New York.  He has also served as Director of the
Poetry Center and Associate Professor of English at the State University
of New York at Stony Brook, and has been on the Guest Poetry Faculty of
New York University’s Creative Writing Program and The New School’s

College of William and Mary, and Sweet Briar, and has taught poetry
workshops at the 92nd Street Y.  Along with poet Toi Derricotte, Eady
founded and is the Director of Cave Canem, an African-American Poets
retreat.

Eady is the author of seven volumes of poetry:  The Autobiography of a
Jukebox (1997); You Don’t Miss Your Water (1995); The Gathering of My
Name (1992); Boom, Boom, Boom (1998); Victims of the Latest Dance Craze
(1986); Kartunes (1980); and Brutal Imagination (2001).  He is also the
author of two music-dramas:  “Running Man,” which was a Pulitzer Prize

His work has appeared in Prairie Schooner, Callaloo, Pequod, Harper’s,
The Kenyon Review, Ploughshares and Agni, and his work has been

Ron Price was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, grew up in Memphis,
Tennessee, and currently lives in New York City, where he is Poet in
Residence at the Juilliard School. His poems have appeared in The
American Poetry Review, Northeast Corridor, The Painted Bride Quarterly,
Poetry, Rattapallax, Southern Exposure, & others. He has poems in
various anthologies including Downtown Poets, & New Rain: Our Fathers,
Ourselves. The past recipient of a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts
Fellowship, in 1996 Price was a U.S.I.A. Visiting Poet to Belgium. In
addition to A Small Song Called Ash From The Fire, he is the author of a
chapbook, Surviving Brothers, & a sixty minute recording called A
Crucible for the Left Hand.
     Fae Myenne Ng, author of Bone, described A Crucible for the Left
Hand, as "powerful, richly textured poems that capture the brutality of
fear and a man's fierce surrendering to love... Like the songs of
redemption, these poems are gifts of hope. They nourish." In a review of
Surviving Brothers, Alexandria Fortunato wrote, "Price is a poet drawn
to the moment after things break down, when a man bends his knee and
begins to pick up the broken pieces. There is a rhythmic feel," she
continued, "that seems to arise as much out of the earth as out of the
poet's acute sense of place," what the Painted Bride Quarterly described
as "intense moments in the midst of the continuing earth."  European
writer and editor Joris Duytschaever wrote, ?Reading Price is a gripping
experience. He shows affinities with Rilke and the masters of empathy.?

Responses to A Small Song Called Ash from the Fire:

It's our great good fortune that the daunting places and undaunted
presences possessing this poet so vividly inhabit his poetry…  I like
this work, I've liked it since the first time I saw it, I'm going to
enjoy and admire it for years to come.
                - William Pitt Root, author of Faultdancing
               and Trace Elements from a Recurring Kingdom

Musical, keenly seen and given…powerful poems of family life, loss and
violence… Price's gift for language, his affinity for the natural world
of hawk, river, oak, coupled with his story telling skills, mark him as
a poet of vision and grace…
            - Colette Inez, author of Clemency and Getting Under Way

Ron Price has created in poem after magnificent poem a grand song, at
once mosaic and splintered solitude, of an America bloody-born in the
Mississippi delta… What a splendid fire, this book of poems.
                               - Indran Amirthanayagam, author of The
Elephants of Reckoning

Daniel A. Olivas





Daniel is the author of the novella, The Courtship of Mara Rivera Pea
(hope your character set can read that!) to be published by Silver Lake
Publishing in late December 2000.  His short stories and poems have
appeared in Exquisite Corpse, THEMA, Perihelion, 3rd Muse, The Pacific
Review, Red River Review, The Morpo Review and  many others.   He
currently lives in the San Fernando Valley.

One of the more interesting seders around.


"Blood, Frogs"

Blood, Frogs....
Do you know me, Adonai?
A latecomer to your Seder table?
A visitor waiting for Elijah?

Vermin, Wild Beasts....
You blessed the Moabite,
Ruth, with an honored place
in Ketuvim, so there must be
hope for me.

Pestilence, Boils....
My people have suffered, too,
though nothing like the Inquisition
or the Holocaust.  But the Aztecs
were fooled and then slaughtered,
raped and oppressed by
the Spaniards who rode proud horses
roughshod over meso-America
creating a mixed gente,
the Mestizos.  And then discrimination,
a glass ceiling we hit, in this great
country, as we scratch towards
the American dream.

Hail, Locusts....
But here I sit, a Jew for only
twelve years, looking at the
matzo, bitter herbs, shank bone,
amidst other symbols of oppression
and subsequent Exodus, Diaspora.
My wife's family (and even my son!)
easy and familiar with it all, as much
a second nature as my Chicanismo
is to me.  But each year, I
recognize more and more,
mouthing the Hebrew faster and
faster.  Is there hope for this old dog?

Darkness, Slaying of the First Born....
I took the name of Ysrael when
I converted because Jacob wrestled
with the angel and saw the face
of G-d, before he, too, became a
Jew and took a new name.
I wrestled, struggled (did I see
the face of G-d, too?), for over
six years before making the choice.
It is a choice I do not regret, but, at times,
when my ten-year-old son breezes through
the Four Questions in Hebrew (not English!),
I am a stranger searching in bewilderment's
twilight for my soul.  Can an outsider
take on another people's traditions,
burdens and history while maintaining
his own proud history?
Can an outsider ever stop wandering?
Will I ever be at home?



                                Daniel A. Olivas

>>>>JENNY SMITH is Program Assistant at The Poetry Project and a co-founder of the Prague School of Poetics. She has recently published work in The Boog Portable Reader, The New Orleans Review, Exquisite Corpse, and Jejune Magazine. Her plays A Lobster Dinner and Tall Cotton were performed in Prague last year. She edits Slender Loris Press, a press which as yet has not done anything but be named. A chapbook, Some of these Poems are about Animals, is forthcoming from Hollowdeck Press.

>>>MATVEI YANKELEVICH has published translations and original work and translations in Open City, Literal Latte, Dirigible, and on-line at www.canwehaveourballback.com. He co-edits two periodicals from Ugly Duckling Presse: a biweekly theater broadsheet, the EMERGENCY gazette, and the poetry almanac 6x6 (6 poets x 6 pages).



>>>>NATHANIEL FARRELL has made his printed debut in 6x6 issue #3, but he's been seen around the city wearing various hats at Horace Mann Theatre, Nada, and Clemente Soto Valez. As an actor he will be reappearing in Yelena Gluzman's staging of Howard Barker's Scenes From An Execution in June at chashama. He is also known as Willie (Wile E.) Lumiere of the Lumiere Bros., editors of The Emergency Gazette. Mr. Farrell was born and grew up in Western Pennsylvania, attended Columbia University and now resides in Queens, where he spies on his neighbor. He would like to thank Mr. Chaplin and Ms. Susie Q.

>>>>>>SAMANTHA VISDAATE doesn't know what she likes and dislikes anymore. Her backbone is made of rigor. She doesn't usually call herself a poet, although she has written poems. She is happy to be published by the Ugly Duckling Presse.


>>>>>EUGENE OSTASHEVSKY currently teaches at a Turkish University. That is why he could not attend the reading tonight. Before Turkey, he lived in San Francisco, where he was a member of the performance trio Vainglorious and, before that, the writers' cartel 9X9 Industries. He enjoys volleyball and shuffleboard. His poems have appeared in 6,500, Combo, Lungfull! and Oxygen. Like Matvei, he is translating the Russian absurdist Aleksandr Vvedenskii.

   " Music is serious business in the African-
    American community because it is so intricately
    interwoven with our identity. Most of us don't
    have to strain to see those graceful, swaying
    shadows of contemporary America in cahoots
    with the night in Congo Square - committing an
    act of sabotage merely by dancing to keep the
    forbidden gods alive..."

Yusef Komunyakaa and WIlliam Matthews. _Georgia Review_ 46:4 (Winter

    animal need to see

    we are made of honey

    to let the devil use your head
    for a drum"

Well,

Another year winds off and Stephen Dunn is the best poet in America!

(Well, this year, as the Pulitzers say! [Or as the Pulitzers yell.
Something like that.])

And it wasn't even a selected poems!
(At least I don't think it was . . .)

HA!

Well, you might say "panning" is the cinematic version of the "perfect,"
except that it takes place through the eye; time is experienced through the
eye. To assume that the eye is lobotimized from the rest of the brain is
nonsense. What does the film being "inert in relation to time" mean? Except
perhaps that Alan likes words, believes in their inherent superiority to the
eye and has an experience of movies which is like a pre-toddler's experience
of his/her mother -out of sight, no ma! To me, Alan's view of movies is a
continuum of separation anxiety.

"Jump cuts," in effect, are another way the "perfect" records itself in
movies. In a jump-cut, the mind projects a compressed series of events
between two shots, unless it is lobotomized or, like the poor guy in the
movie "Memento," it lost its ability to make new memories.

I assume Alan means something bad by it; I think it is good.

What does this exactly mean? Weren't Virginia Wolfe in her novels and James
Joyce in "Ulysses" trying to do somethin akin to an ideal of "90 minutes in
the lives of characters"? Of course, "confluences" may have saved them from
doing it.

Are you implying that Hamlet lives less in Act III than in Act I?

I have an anectodal footnote to add. My son writes movies scripts and is
studying to be a director. He won't see a movie even if he is going to miss
half of the credits. I am less militant about it and often drive him crazy if
we are going together. Sometimes, from the get go, I begin to make loud
comments if the movie appears to me will be stupid -to the annoyance and
occasional laughter of the audience. Other times I take a twenty minute nap.
Not really that different from what you are doing, Alan, except that I don't
feel I am being involved in an inferior  activity.__

Ciao.

Damon. I like this a lot...especially things like:  "eclecstatic" ,
"ontolopportunity","nerverflow of lipsill sticky buckets", "spocked at the
outset", "enorm pink","overglimming" and the whole effect is better when I
read it aloud. Excellent. My first impressions. We should all put more work
on.Good stuff.Oh, and "Volsions"! What a word! Richard.

Gary. Ramez was clearly an extraordinary thinker and his poetry highly
imaginative and intelligent. Uncannily I have just been looking through
Fanny Howe's book of poems (I purchased it here a month or so ago) and his
explication and thoughts on it are timely and fascinating for me. Also his
review of J H Prynne's book has inspired me to purchase his collected poems.
(Finally..its not cheap!) His reviews are incredibly attentive to what he
has read. The Prynne book is quite large, and would daunt many, but Ramez is
very thorough and perceptive. I also liked Ramez's very imaginative poem
with the multiple Eves and so on. Obviously a highly energetic and
enthusiastic thinker...I'm still working through these reviews. Fascinating.
Thanks. Richard.

SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC HOSTS TWO FABULOUS EVENTS THIS WEEKEND!


Friday, April 20, 2001 at 7:30 pm

Kelsey St. Press Book Party & Reading with Renee Gladman & Elizabeth
Robinson

Renee Gladman's JUICE is a quartet of stories whose settings range from
the Gothic village of Hawthorne, flooding the skies with question marks, to
the vagabond lesbian community of Mission San Francisco. What unites these
tales is the eye under which they tell their truths, the large, all-seeing
eye
of the oracular and the small. Renee Gladman was born in Atlanta in 1971
and now makes her home in Oakland. Her previous books include Arlem
(Idiom Books,1996) and Not Right Now (Second Story Books, 1998). She
edited Clamour magazine, and her new publishing project is Leroy Books.

Elizabeth Robinson's House Made of Silver marks another new direction for
the prolific poet whose previous books include Bed of Lists. For many,
Robinson represents all that is best about lyric abstraction, its
questioning of perception, its finesse of experiment, and elegant
individualism. Often
overlooked are its spiritual undertones, for here is a poetry on fire with
a serene, fatalistic faith in the little and big. In years to come
Biblical scholars will
be adding House Made of Silver to the "Dead Sea Scrolls" and wondering how
they turned up in a little garden in Berkeley.

*

Content's Dream: Essays, 19751984 is the celebrated intervention into
contemporary poetics by one of its leading practitioners, Charles Bernstein.

First published in 1986, and now a classic for all who care about the poetry
and poetics of the late twentieth-century, Content’s Dream is a witty,
consummately intelligent, and ever stylish collection of essays by one of the
country’s most innovative and influential poets, whose work has come to be
associated with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, the magazine he coedited at the time these
essays were being written.

Addressing a wide range of arts, Bernstein's essays move gracefully from
discussions of Mad Max, Stan Brakhage, Stanley Cavell, Wittgenstein, and
Arakawa, to William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky. Lyn Hejinian, Laura
Riding, and Jackson Mac Low and Lyn Hejinian. Rather than propose grand
theories, Bernstein synthesizes the many sets of ideas that are necessary for a
practical understanding of contemporary culture. Reading a variety of texts and
expanding on his own thinking and method, Bernstein provides an essential
introduction to the innovative poetry and poetics of  L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. He also
explores the conditions, experiences, and alienation of everyday life and the
ethical traps of characterization and representation, imagining a “thinking”
poetry of both process and critique that acknowledges -- and responds to -- the
intractability and complexity of  contemporary cultural and social problems.

At once irreverent and deeply serious, as indebted to Groucho Marx as it is to
Karl Marx, Content's Dream stakes out a clear cultural and aesthetic position
for one extraordinary poet, for innovative poetry, and for our time.

“Certain works are recognized as defining an epoch. . .  .Postmodernism is now
a distinctly articulated cultural formation.  Within it, Content’s Dream has
been without question one of its defining critical and aesthetic documents.”
Jerome McGann, University of Virginia

“A terrific manifestation of an exemplary contemporary intellectual forging
what we might consider a conscience for his time.”
Charles Altieri, UC-Berkeley

Charles Bernstein is Director of the Poetics Program at the State University of
New York at Buffalo and author of My Way: Speeches and Poems and Republics of
Reality: 1975-1995.

it will bring harm to you; it will bring harm to me:
sometimes there are strange reflections in the screen:
i worry about the effect his eyes are having on her:
nervousness leads to strange links and attractions:
you might begin thinking nothing of written language:
so many times i've found a stare that is almost real:
these people out there, who are they, what do they do:
it's true that web sites can be set adrift:
if someone hassles you on line, it is a rogue machine:
whatever happens is a blip in machine, in time:
all knocks are unknown and traced to someone here:
reading hacks you into more and different brains:
suspicion greets everyone with a presumption of harm:
the backs of things are airless:
harm comes on no one's wings and no one's wheels:
nothing, everything, all, none, are alive:
the screen casts shadows of the sun:
beyond beyond is always harmful comfort:
someone beckons from a very real thing:

 Hawaii strike report, April 17, 2001



I'm just back from five or six hours on the picket line, where today we =
offered line-crossers a free pass for smiling and honking (this IS =
Hawaii, after all). Most took us up on our offer, though learning curves =
were variously steep or shallow, but some pucker-faced citizens =
adamantly refused and a few even waved us on as we circled with all =
deliberate speed (as it were). Rumor has it that this is the last day of =
the UH faculty strike, though we've heard nothing yet and it's almost 4 =
p.m. The teachers are nowhere near an agreement and, because the state =
has only one negotiator for its many public union negotiations, they =
will have to wait until tomorrow even to talk with the state. It's =
rather incredible to drive to work on my longish commute and to see =
every school closed and fronted by picketers-and then to get to UH, =
which is allegedly still open, but effectively slowed to a crawl by =
faculty in their by now trademark white UHPA baseball caps and ON STRIKE =
teeshirts.

The remaining bones of contention between the faculty and the state are =
three: lecturer pay (the governor's last offer was a work of =
art-lecturers who had worked for three years in the system would get a =
small raise, but new lecturers would get LESS money than they do now, so =
what school wouldn't want to trade in the sophomores for the freshmen =
over and again?); community college workload and teaching equivalences; =
and, of course, money for regular faculty. I can only imagine that our =
union would have caved a while back over the tiny difference between our =
pay demand and the offers we've been getting, but there's so much =
hostility between us and the governor that we feel we're picketing not =
so much for pay as for the salvation of the university itself. That may =
sound grand, but the UH has been cut by 1/3 over the last seven years, =
and there's precious little left to protect. There's also the governor's =
way of making every "offer" into an insult to goad us on.

I wonder how much of this "war" is about Hawaii and its poor regard for =
public education (anyone with enough money, it seems, except for flaming =
idealists, sends their kids to public school and now universities on the =
continent) and how much is a more general national problem. American =
anti-intellectualism is strong, after all, as is the equation of success =
with business. Hence our governor's desire to support parts of the =
university that "make money," like biogenetics.=20

Governor Ben Cayetano, by the way, is apparently up for an honorary =
doctorate from his alma mater, UCLA. Not only that, a new chair is being =
set up in his name in the Asian American Studies Program, directed by =
Prof. Don Nakanishi, who responded to a recent email from me by wishing =
us all well and not mentioning the governor at all. Anyone with time on =
his or her hands might send emails to UCLA administrators or regents to =
suggest that rewarding Cayetano for his support for that institution =
would be folly at this point, and an insult to the teachers and faculty =
of Hawaii's schools and university system.

The picket line remains a place of solidarity between faculty in =
different departments and the police, who are definitely on our side. =
They also have bones to pick with the governor and the mayor and their =
numbers have diminished in recent years when police recruiters have come =
in from other states. I'm grateful for the chance to meet them and to =
meet folks in other departments, whose interest in education does not =
dim even as the sun climbs and climbs each day.

Finally, I got a letter from my representative today. She's Patsy Mink. =
I remember as a little girl in Virginia thinking how wonderful it was =
that there was a Congresswoman Patsy Mink. She reports that she met with =
the governor on Friday the 13th and that he "expressed great dismay at =
the rejection" of his merit pay proposal; early on, his entire offer of =
raises was based on "merit," whatever that is in such a setting as ours =
(as Steve Carll has pointed out, merit pay works better in business than =
in the academy). She is confident the matter will be resolved soon.

Where have I heard that before?

Aloha, Susan

    Tom:

    realize you are interested in a "poetics of activism"--
    however i think it is really a
    "poetics IN activism"
    --because if one made the poetics separate from the activism--
    would it not be the dread "faith without works"?!

    An excellent ongoing example of the conjunctions of
internet/actitivism/poetries is
    AUMA  GOM@  :  Urgent Action Mail Art/Global Organization Mail @rt
    This organization was founded in 1998 in response to the events
surrounding the     fate of Pinochet and as well the case of Humberto Nilo in
Santiago, Chile.
     Sr. Nilo as head of the Faculty of Arts/Belle Lettres at the University
of Chile had organized the exhibition of mail art and visual poetry "Litertad
para la ensenanza de las artes"  (Freedom in the teaching of the arts).  Due
to the democratic ideals exemplified by the exhibition's purposes and the
works displayed, Sr.  Nilo was expelled from the University.
    In response to these events, Cesar Reglero (Spain), Clemente Padin
(Uruguay), Fernando Garcia Delgado (Argentina), Tartarugo (Spain) and Hans
Braumuller (Chile/Germany) founded AUMA GOM@ and initiated actions and
exhibitions which helped in the reinstatement of Sr. Nilo and changes in the
University.
    In the last three years, working often with Amnesty International AUMA
GOM@ has organized many traveling exhibitions, conferences, discussions,
actions.  Recent calls for work and participation have been AGAINST DEATH
PENALTY and POR VIEQUES.
    The history of the organization, records of first organizational
meetings, relevant communications (emails and so on) and links to AUMA
associated sites and artists are at this site:

    http://www.fut.es/~boek861

    This excellent web site also includes theoretical works, statements and
debates which involve many of the issues of internet/activism in relation to
visual poetry and mail art.   (See for example the writings of over fifty
artists who participated in the yearlong Open Debate Mail Art/Mail Art in the
New Millennium, 2000.)  There is also the monthly updated CMA Univers(o) with
complete information of mail art and visual poetry conferences, calls, zines,
events, web sites.

    I would also most highly recommend activist/art sites:

Subject: Support Hawaii Education Update PLEASE READ AND DISTRIBUTE

PLEASE READ, DISTRIBUTE, AND TAKE ACTION. THANKS!

Hawai'i educators are still on strike. Talks broke down over the weekend,
and the latest I have heard is that they will resume today.  Those on strike
have appreciated the show of support, and as the strike continues this
support becomes even more critical. Please show your support of Hawai'i's
educational system and the right for teachers' salaries to keep pace with
the cost of living.  Please show your support for quality education in
Hawai'i for all of its residents.

1) Even Senators Inouye, Akaka, and Representatives Mink and Abercrombie
have been supportive of the educators.  They have been attempting to
negotiate between the educators and Governor Cayetano.
PLEASE WRITE OR CALL THEM TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT.
Here are the Honolulu phone numbers, area code (808):
Sen. Dan Inouye, 541-2542
Sen. Dan Akaka, 522-8970
Congresswoman Patsy Mink, 541-1986
Congressman Neil Abercrombie, 541-2750
All of their mail addresses are at the
Prince Kuhio Federal Building
Honolulu HI 96850-4977

2)  This is affecting us in our own backyard so to speak. UCLA's
Asian American Studies Center is currently raising funds for an
endowed chair -- the Benjamin Cayetano Professor in Public Policy and
American Politics. Cayetano is an alumni of UCLA, and was honored in
1995 for public service by
the UCLA Asian American Studies Center.

According to one of  the persons on strike in Hawai'i:
'Remember, this is a man who promised not to cut the UH budget, then chopped
off $35 million, who has gleefully watched our national standing collapse,
and who believes that we should not receive health benefits during the summer,
or let the summer months count toward retirement, because "we don't work
then." He does not answer questions that ask about UCLA -- why its
professors deserve summer benefits and a living wage.'

It almost appears that Cayetano cares more about his relationship
with UCLA than with UH. Has he served the public interest in Hawai'i
by continuing to decimate the educational system, by refusing to
authorize Legislature-approved raises for teachers throughout the
state's educational system, or by attempting to prorate teachers'
salaries only for the months they are in the classroom? Given
Hawai'i's demographic make-up, Cayetano's actions are directly
hurting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.  If this seems to be a
contradiction to you, please communicate your concerns to the
Director of UCLA's Asian American Studies Center:

Don T. Nakanishi, Ph.D.

Comments: To: Tenney Nathanson <tenney@dakotacom.net>

April 16, 2001


Dear Friend of POG:

I’m writing to invite you to our annual benefit dinner—and to request your
support for POG.  The dinner is Sunday, May 6, at 7 pm.

This year we’re having a (pretty lavish) buffet.  Weather permitting, we’ll
enjoy outdoor as well as indoor dining.  Tickets are just $25 (or $30 at the
door); there’s a special $15 ticket price for students and starving artists.
We hope the enclosed menu whets your appetite!

To order your ticket, please mail your check, made out to POG, to 2345 E.
8th St., Tucson,  AZ  85719.

We’ve just completed our fifth season of POG programming.  In that time we’
ve presented such visiting artists as David Bromige, Roberto Tejada, Bob
Perelman, Leslie Scalapino, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge, Tom Raworth, Jerry
Rothenberg, Michael Davidson, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Norman Fischer,
Juan Felipe Herrera, Rodrigo Toscano, Hung Tu, Bernadette Mayer, Juliana
Spahr, Lyn Hejinian, Cole Swensen, Diane Glancy, Jackson Mac Low, Nora Marks
Dauenhauer, and Myung Mi Kim; and such Arizona artists as Victor Masayesva,
Jim Waid, Cynthia Miller, A. C. Huerta, Alex Garza, Lisa Cooper, Nancy
Solomon, Barbara Penn, Jen Bervin, Sheila Murphy, Danny Lopez, the Ge Oidag
Village (Big Fields) Traditional Dancers, Donald Eno Washington, Anne
Bunker, Gwen Ray, Sam Ace (L. Smukler), Jay Vosk, and Dan Buckley.  As I
hope this list makes clear, POG is committed to cross-over avant-garde
programming; POG offers, we think, an array of presenting artists not
otherwise available in Tucson. Our events typically pair a poet with the
practitioner of another art form; a visiting artist with a local one; and a
well-known name with an emergent one.  Our goal is to expand the avant-garde
audience for all the arts though such cross-over programs.  We’ll be back in
2001-2002 with another exciting and innovative series of events.

POG needs your support.  We benefit from grants from the Tucson-Pima Arts
Council and the Arizona Commission on the Arts.  But 70% of our budget comes
from event admissions and fund-raising activities like this one.  Our
immediate goal is to raise at least $500 through our buffet dinner to help
us balance our 2000-2001 budget.

So we hope you’ll attend the dinner, enjoy some wonderful food and some
wonderful company, and help support POG.

Sincerely,

Tenney Nathanson
President, Board of Directors

The Hawai`i faculty strike ended last night; what follows is a description
of the terms that were reached with the state (aka governor).

The teachers' strike continues.  Some 180,000 students are still out of
school.

aloha, Susan

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

To my mind, the winner is a chapbook:

      Sunflower
      by Jack Collom & Lyn Hejinian
      published by The Figures

RUNNERS UP (in no particular order):

      Mon Canard by Stephen Rodefer
(perhaps uneven, but the title poem alone more than makes up for it)

      rue Wilson Monday by Anselm Hollo

      On The Nameways by Clark Coolidge

      Autobiography of a Cyborg by Bhanu Kapil Rider
(another chapbook that can hold its own against larger offerings)

      Point and Line by Thalia Field
(yeah, perhaps more readily categorizible as fiction, but it crosses
boundaries & can't easily be ignored)

      Comp. by Kevin Davies

      Was the reprint of Tottering State by Tom Raworth dated 2000?  I
haven't seen it, but have the original The Figures edition which includes
"Ace" but not "Writing."  It certainly deserves a nod.

SPECIAL RUNNER UP:

      Paramour by Stacy Doris

". . . in the twentieth century . . . poetry written in the Spanish
language began and ended--in short, was led--by two Nicaraguan poets, on
the one end, Rub=E9n Dario and, on the other, Ernesto Cardenal."
   --Roberto Fernandez Retamar
   "Prologue to Ernesto Cardenal," in Caliban and Other Essays

World-renowned Nicaraguan poet-priest ERNESTO CARDENAL--former Minister
of Culture under the Sandinista government, and among the most significant
Latin American literary figures of the past half-century--visits San
=46rancisco in a rare appearance, co-sponsored by The Poetry Center, New
College of California, and Mission Cultural Center.  Among his many books
to appear in Spanish and in English translation over the past decades are
Oracion por Marilyn Monroe y otros poemas, Hora O/Zero Hour, Homenaje a los
Indios Americanos, Cosmic Canticle, El estrecho dudoso/The Doubtful
Straits, Apocalypse and Other Poems, Flights of Victory, Quetzalcoatl, and
others.  Father Cardenal will read his poetry in Espa=F1ol, with spoken
English translations read by poet Alejandro Murguia.

Ernesto Cardenal was born in 1925 in Granada, Nicaragua.  He attended the
University of Mexico (1944-48) and Columbia University (1948-49), as well
as the Trappist monastic community in Gethsemane, Kentucky directed by
Thomas Merton.  In 1965 he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest, and
developed a politics and practice he considered "Christian-Marxist."  He is
well-known throughout Latin America and North America as a spokesman for
social justice and self-determination.

It's a tie!  All contestants are deadlocked at 30 votes!  It's a fight to
the finish!  I've never seen such excrement, er, excitement in this majestic
world of poetry.  This is a thrilling contest never to be forgotten!  I
can't believe it!

If it's a tie at the end, then do all of them need to leave the island, or
do all of them get to stay?  Oh what a thrill!

Boy, I just love a good competition!  I wonder what this evening's runner-up
receives?  A lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni?

Marge, break out the popcorn!  This is going to be some contest!

a book out now from them (and others) and I have abrie note on it at:

thanks for the leads, Dave.  I'm actually at this point not sure what to
call what I'm seeking.  there is some 'art' in what I am doing - the poetic
gesture or impulse that got me involved in writing an initial poem based on
my experiences and perceptions as a member of the online self-help
discussion group and the posts by members, but the whole thing has evolved
into a movement in which people are writing about their experiences and
sending their stories to the FDA and congressmen, etc. (not necessarily
initieated by what I wrote) and it has had some real-life effects, again not
necessarily related to what I wrote.  I'm not sure if the real-life outcome
is necessarily related to the aesthetics of the 'movement' which I have come
to see as a 'symphony' of emails.

I think I'm strating to 'see' a forest here but not sure how to describe it,
if in fact description is desirable.  The site that was constructed is
visible at the moment at http://www.geocities.com/lotronexactiongroup/
as are sites for other parties involved and most of the email traffic is
accesible, but these elements will disappear in time.

I guess that I'm looking for is a 'poetics' of social movements (not
necessarily radical or left or right), but have not come across anything on
the internet or in print since Che and Saul Alinsky.

By the way, for you or anyone with an interest in the actual problem, ibs
should be a 'household' word in the coming months as new treatments are in
the works and this is ibs awareness month as well as poetry month.  Public
Citizen just issued a press release again and even though it's opposed to
the re-release of lotronex it looks like this time the media will be payng
more attention.  The group itself recently petitioned the FDA and has
managed to keep th FDA and GlaxoSmithKline meeting about a possible
re-release of the drug in the near future - something that has NEVER
happened.

I guess I could go on-and-on about this so I'll just stop here.

Ron. I dont know, but on the contemporary poetry I clicked the B and there's
no Charles Bernstein and I clicked the S and there's no Ron Silliman? Two of
the major 20th/21st century writers. Have Holman and Snyder got a snitcher
or what's going on? Regards, Richard.

Y'know, what lately impresses me about Sondheim's literature --- and
what may account for some of the recurrent protests against his
prolificity here on The List --- is its MUSICALITY. (Retinal, upper
case after-image: MUSICALITY.) A piece like the one below, Rick, or
many of Sondheim's, conjure up an ideal performance by someone like,
say, a Laurie Andersen.  The cadences are often oratorical/rhetorical,
"aloud," rather than page-driven.  There's an element of repetition in
 Sond's word-art that draws from the ~declamatory,~ instead of the
prevalent, usual, silent interiorized reading style. ---Which may
account for these waves of "get 'im outta here" protests that
seasonally let loose, once a new crop of newcomers has passed the frat
hazing and is starting to feel (entitlement) that their maintenance
fee on the co-op should give them license to evict.  In "page time,"
trying to read/wade through the repetition tropes, the reading can in
fact at times feel like its going against the current of the
language's inertias,--- but when I re-imagine the texts as occuring in
real time and aloud, that cyclicality becomes quite endurable and even
a sort of entertaining, habitable background music ("muzak") kind of
Sensaround environment.  His fugues.  And yet the repetitions AREN'T
principally demagoguery; they derive from combinatorialities so
alphabetic in style that suspicions of text-generating computer
programs have been--- gulped.  It's always difficult to live
contemporary to the unbounded proliferation of a complete "Leaves of
Grass."-- JJ

Philip Lamantia:

Fanatico, rhapsodist, madcap, sage. He was Francis da Pavia in Dharma Bums
and David D'Angeli in Desolation Angels, but he might as well be Saint Simo=
n
Stylites riding Gerard de Nerval=92s lobster in the Palais Royale. After
almost sixty years of poetic endeavor, Lamantia is one of the last living
poets of the Beat era, though he is most definitively a Surrealist poet,
having early on associated with Andr=E9 Breton, who called him =93a voice t=
hat
rises once in a hundred years.=94 His works include Touch of the Marvelous
(Oyez, 1966), Selected Poems 1943-1966 (City Lights Books, 1967), The Blood
of the Air (Four Seasons Foundation, 1970), Becoming Visible, (City Lights
Books, 1981), Meadowlark West, (City Lights, 1986), and Bed of Sphinxes: Ne=
w
and Selected Poems 1943-1993 (City Lights Books 1997). Philip will be
premiering mostly new work at this reading, so ear-horns up, sweeties!

John Olson:

Seattle poet John Olson's latest work is a collection of poetry titled Echo
Regime from Black Square Editions. He is also the author of Eggs & Mirrors.
His poems have appeared in Sulfur, New American Writing, and Exquisite
Corpse among other mags.=20

Will Alexander:

Local teacher, mage, and poetic strato-seer. Norma Cole says of Alexander=
=92s
book Above the Human Nerve Domain: "This glorious set of whirling prosodic
proofs exult that a body can be struck by stanzaic facts of light. The
reader is dazzled by expanding forms of predictory anaphora arriving as an
"instantaneous beam." The author of Vertical Rainbow Climber, Arcane
Lavender Morals, Asia & Haiti, and The Stratospheric Canticles has done it
again with strobic precision.=94

Is  Resistance Futile?
A M/E/A/N/I/N/G Forum

With editors Susan Bee & Mira Schor
and panelists Daryl Chin, David Humphrey, Barbara Pollack,
Lucio Pozzi, and Carolee Schneemann

Tuesday May 1, 2001 at 7 P.M.

On Star Trek, the Borg always tell their victims, before they "assimilate"
them, "Resistance is futile."

Is resistance to the "Spectacle" possible or even desirable today?

Five years after we stopped publishing M/E/A/N/I/N/G, a journal of contemporary
art issues, and on the occasion of the publication by Duke University Press of
M/E/A/N/I/N/G: An Anthology of Artists' Writings, Theory, and Criticism, we
will gather a few of our former contributors together for a panel discussion at
A.I.R. Gallery on Tuesday May 1 at 7 PM to consider ideas of resistance,
assimilation, and participation.

Possibly they are as out of it as whoever's running the
pages for poets at the Buffalo site, which--last time I
looked--had no page for John M. Bennett, Richard
Kostelanetz or Karl Kempton, three of our time's major
writers.

    (Before jumping the gun so to speak in passing judgment on the cinema in
relation    to writing, it would be good to consider Eisenstein's writings on
the     interrelationships among film and literature, poetry, calligraphy,
painting, theater.
    Many many more examples have been developed and presented since his
    first writings in the 1920s.
    As for film and thinking: the two volumes of Gilles Deleuze, CINEMA The
Movement-Image and CINEMA The Time-Image.  Deleuze uses film as a method for
the     extension of philosophical thinking.)

    Sondheim's remarks are part of the long tradition of abstraction and
fundamentalism (Puritanism has played quite some role I think in the USA) in
relation to writing.
    The object seems to be to liberate writing from the senses, so as to have
a more immediate relationship with the Word.
    This approach to writing has exerted a strong influence especially since
the advent of the various Formalisms of the last century.
    A counter movement has been those approaches to writing which propose
relationships with hieroglyphics, calligraphies, visual/sound notations,
painting, collage, montage, cinema, performance.  Writing in this area makes
use of methodologies and examples extending in time and space from the
earliest forms of notation to the most contemporary, across many media and
materials.
    In the first,  writing, the Word, is "apart from" --
    In the second, writing is "a part of"--
    An excellent essay on the effects of this difference may be found in
    "Notation and the Art of Reading"  by Karl Young
    at:  http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm
    the history of the second writing (call it visual or any other name it
has                 acquired since) since Mallarme's "Un Coup de des" is one
of ongoing extensions,  examples, explorations--
    to cite a few of these non-Formalist senses of writing in
interrelationships with         visual/sound/performative notations:
        "It is a script that is at once . . . pictorial, symbolic and
phonetic within the             same text, the same sentence, I would almost
say within the same word."
            --Francois Champollian, on translating the Egyptian
hieroglyphics,
                                                        14 September 1822
        "Bookmovie is the movie in words, the visual American form"
                    --Jack Kerouac, "Belief & Technique for Modern Prose"
        " . . .the written word is an image . . . I think that anyone who is
interested to           find out the precise relationship between word and
image should study a                simplified hieroglyphic script.  Such a
study would tend to breakdown the               automatic verbal reaction to
a word.  It is precisely these automatic reactions          to words
themselves that enable those who manipulate words to control
thought on a mass scale."
                    --William S. Burroughs, THE JOB  Interviews with Daniel
Odier
        " . . . the example of cinema should help . . . the project of a . .
. poetry
        embracing sound, visual, and verbal signs vitalized by one function
(the poetic)        . . . [in] confrontation with the ruling system in the
field of the manifestations             of language, and consequently, of the
ideas, values and habits (including             sensibility itself) as
structural bases of the dominant ideological complex."

But I think you miss some subtleties of what Alan is doing by this kind of
analysis. Read that thing aloud. When I saw it I had the sun (outside )
behind my computer screen....and i could "see" where Alan  was coming from.
Breaking it up to "analyse" it is futile. The whole thing works both on a
conceptual level and a "deeper" level.Alan Sondheim is both prolific and
very talented. Where are your poems? Regards, Richard Taylor.

I know that JJ doesnt think that I didnt intend to support Alan's work, but,
my last comments may have been a bit confusing: my intent was to endorse
Alan Sondheim's work. Its good to see it. I find it intriguing and each one
has a different "take". I certainly find his energy and content fascinating
and always look foreward to it. He also has a CD ROM (which I havent had
time to study) , but  obviously Alan is a very serious and highly energetic
and talented poet/writer. I get the feeling that a lot of people lack his
courage to put their work on line ...on the line so to speak..in case they
get "criticised" surely that would be "parr for the course". Alan has
inspired me in at least one thing I did. I'm not "into" his obsession with
the cyberworld so much or so much of his "political" takes (altho they are
interesting) but I do admire his passion and ability. Most of all I enjoy
his productions which pour out...as they obviously should and do.Regards,
Richard Taylor.

and some dinosaurs are concerned that matters of
aesthetics, poetry and are being usurped by
political concerns - i wonder where they got such
and idea?

i suppose if a poem were written on the matter -
and posted to the list - i might be "convinced"
that such people were simply being reactionary

when newspaper reportage becomes poetry, i can't
help but think something went wrong somewhere
along the line - but trying to tell the
difference between this list and any other
politically motivated list (with its own "slant")
has been getting difficult as of late

of course - i could be crazy...

KEITH ROACH AND DEBORAH RICHARDS
Poet, curator, and arts organizer Keith Roach had a long residency as
Ceremonial Master of the Open Room while hosting the Friday night slam at
the Nuyorican Poets Caf=E9. His poetry, urban, generous, dreamy, and deep, ca=
n
be read in the anthology Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Caf=E9. Mr.
Roach is currently working on his first full collection of poetry. Deborah
Richards is a poet, performer and director. She recently wrote and directed

YUKIHIDE MAESHIMA HARTMAN AND CAROL SZAMATOWICZ
Born in Japan and long prominent in the New York poetry world, Yukihide
Maeshima Hartman is the author of several collections of poetry, including
Ping, New Poems, and Coloring Book. "Yuki Hartman orders his images around
with temerity of a lion tamer. He's as gifted a poet as they come," writes
Charles North. Carol Szamatowicz is the author of two collections of poems,
Cats & Birds and Zoop (The Owl Press, 2001). Her work has appeared in Lingo=
,
The Germ, and The World. In reviewing a reading she gave at Poetry City,
Jordan Davis writes, "Carol pays a lot of attention to the salient details
of social interaction, which facts I observe in the modest and informative
sentences she prefers. [...] Here are some things she said: 'These cheeses
are history'; 'There's only five channels and beer. I accept that.'; 'There
is a couple who loved each other since childhood and that is all that is
left of them'; 'I think you are the one who spilled'; 'Besides the suspicio=
n
of sleep there is the treachery of wood'; 'I was a brisk little tooth
drifting to earth'; 'Boredom that makes us long for the freedom of combat';
'Lick something everyday, I say'; 'A hell where we feed ourselves with
three-foot chopsticks'."

Patti Smith; poet, musician, and Basketball Diaries author Jim Carroll; poe=

performer John S. Hall; performer, conductor, composer, and pioneer of Worl=
d
Music David Amram; and many others. Celebrated Beat poet Gregory Corso died
on January 17, 2001. Born in Greenwich Village in 1930, Corso hooked up wit=
h
Allen Ginsberg and the other Beat poets at Columbia University in the 1940s=
.
He moved to San Francisco in 1956, quickly fitting into the Beat scene
there. Corso's poetic voice was simple, colloquial, funny, and
unpretentious. Among his books of poetry and prose are Gasoline (1956), The
Happy Birthday of Death (1960), The American Express (1961), Elegiac
Feelings, American (1970), and Mindfield (1991).

Electronic Conference of Poetry Report from Front Lines

we're at the start of this electronic poetry conference and already blood
has been shed; i got into a fite with a couple of the mac people who were
armed to the teeth with some sort of transparent swords but they cut swift
they did and i coudn't resist the parry of blows that went my way but i
had the car and they got run over but that didn't stop other things from
appearing. stop. otyher things appeared. stop. you shuold have seen them
when the rollover happened. stop. ha ha ha mac people you are not up to pc
people. this is the proof. ha ha . they said i coud be stopped but i cant
be. stopp. this is what happens whenthere are wires loose in mac people
brains. a pc joke. do mac people have brains. no. (pc. answer.) stoppp.

it was heavy shockwave last night against flash and both pretty much lit
up the sky like a mosaic opera. oh it was splendid did i tell you. another
poet was killed, it was a short accident but notebooks kil. i am so jeal
ous of that poet, why. because he got twenty minutes of standing only. i
do not get that. my work is so clumsy! nikuko won't stop stalking to me.
oh what else. why jealousy is green. it used to be another color before
the color change. that is why. they say jealousy kills. it is so astound
ingly horrible i will never be able to give you teh impression, not even
if i leave another milion years.

omeday someone will say, well what confrence were YOU at, and i will say
this one where horror and ecstasy mingled.

Subject:      Blake takes on drug companies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Happily, this piece is now a little out of date. I
figured it was interesting anyway.
From an anrchist/libertarian Marxist website called
Practical History:
http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/7672/

On the final day (11 February 2001) of the William
Blake exhibition at the Tate Britain Gallery in
London, 30 people gathered on the steps outside to
reclaim Blake from 'the dead hand of capital, empire
and state' and to denounce the corporate sponsors of
the Blake exhibition, GlaxoSmithKline.

People dressed up as angels, tigers, chimney sweeps
and in other suitably Blakean costumes, with a child’s
pushchair converted into a ‘chariot of fire’. We
banged drums, played music, and read out work from the
18th century radical poet, artist and visionary. A
leaflet was handed out saying:

"The William Blake exhibition at the Tate Britain
gallery makes it clear that Blake was a revolutionary
as well as a visionary – yet bizarrely it is sponsored
by one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical
companies, GlaxoSmithKline (formerly Glaxo Wellcome).
While Blake railed against poverty and oppression,
GlaxoSmithKline is denying millions of African people
with HIV access to drugs that could save their lives"
(full text of leaflet below).

The action at the Tate happened the day before a march
demanding affordable HIV treatments was due to take
place in Cape Town, South Africa organised by the
Treatment Action Campaign.

The action got a very good response from visitors to
the Gallery, many of whom stopped to listen to what
was going on. One passer-by who joined in and read out
a Blake poem told the crowd - 'the spirit of Blake is
here on the steps'.

The Tate management were less sympathetic, calling the
police (although there were no arrests) and banning
people from going into the gallery, for the crime of
reading out extracts of Blake - while inside they were
charging £8 for the privelege of seeing works by the
same artist.





Blake vs. GlaxoSmithKline (text of leaflet given out
at the action)

“Is this a holy thing to see / In a rich and fruitful
land/ Babes reduced to misery… And so many children
poor? / It is a land of poverty!” (Blake, Holy
Thursday)

‘Imagine witnessing devastating plague and sitting on
a cure for fear of incurring shareholder revolt. That
essentially is the position of drug companies’ (Ben
Jackson of Action for South Africa)

The William Blake exhibition at the Tate Britain
gallery makes it clear that Blake was a revolutionary
as well as a visionary – yet bizarrely it is sponsored
by one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical
companies, GlaxoSmithKline (formerly Glaxo Wellcome).

While Blake railed against poverty and oppression,
GlaxoSmithKline is denying millions of African people
with HIV access to drugs that could save their lives.
In Britain and the USA, combination therapy with
anti-retroviral drugs has transformed the life chances
of people with HIV. But of the world's 34 million
people infected with HIV, 25 million live in
sub-Saharan Africa: and only 25,000 Africans (0.001
per cent of those infected) receive the drugs. The
reason is that that they and their governments cannot
afford to pay the market price for them.

Anti-retroviral drugs can be manufactured for a
fraction of the price they are sold by GlaxoSmithKline
but this would undermine profits. That is why Glaxo
and other drugs companies are taking the South African
government to court to defend their ‘intellectual
property rights’, i.e. to prevent South Africa from
making or buying abroad cheap, generic copies of
anti-HIV drugs to treat patients. Similar threats have
been made against other African countries.

Glaxo and the British government claim that companies
have a right to protection for the drugs they sell at
high prices in order to recoup research and
development costs. Glaxo have already made millions
from AZT and 3TC, the two drugs in Combivir,  and in
any case they were developed with the help of public
funds in the United States.

The problem isn’t just GlaxoSmithKline – other drugs
companies like Pfizer act in the same way. It isn’t
even just the drugs industry or multinational
corporations. They are backed up by the British state
and by the World Trade Organisation’s TRIPS agreement
(Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights) which allows owners of ‘intellectual property
’to control the exploitation of their inventions
worldwide, determining the price at which they can be
sold and the royalties they receive. They are backed
up by the whole logic of capitalism which decrees that
ideas, objects, fields, buildings, even genes, can be
the sole property of companies and wealthy individuals
to be financially exploited at will.

In placing their logo on the art exhibitions,
corporations like Glaxo Wellcome are laying claim to
the creative energies of the past. In denying
lifesaving drug treatments, they are demonstrating how
the creative energies of all of us, including medical
knowledge, are subordinated to the creation of wealth
rather than the meeting of our needs.

“Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the
field/ Let him look up into the heavens & laugh in the
bright air; / Let the inchained soul shut up in
darkness and in sighing,/ Whose face has never seen a
smile in thirty weary years,/ Rise and look out; his
chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open/ And let
his wife and children return from the oppressor's
scourge./ They look behind at every step & believe it
is a dream,/ Singing, 'The Sun has left his blackness,
& has found a fresher morning / And the fair Moon
rejoices in the clear & cloudless night;/ For Empire
is no more, and now the Lion & Wolf shall cease”
(Blake, America)

 Here's something interesting. I know I'd have to repeat 8th grade again.=
 Wow.
Or I'd be like Jethro on the "Beverly Hillbillies": 'I has six grad
ejukashun."

THE 8th GRADE TEST IN 1895

This is the eighth-grade final exam from 1895 from Salina, Kansas. It  wa=
s
taken from the original document on file at the Smoky Valley
Genealogical Society and Library in Salina, Kansas and reprinted by the
_Salina Journal_:

   "In 1895 the 8th grade was considered upper level education.  Many chi=
ldren
quit school as soon as they could master the basic fundamentals
of the 3R's (reading, writing and arithmetic). Most never went past the 3=
rd or
4th grade. That's all you needed for the farm and most city jobs. Child l=
abor
laws were not in existence yet. Additionally today's education has much m=
ore
focus on technology and sociology than the grammar and geography of old. =
It's
a  different world with different requirements and capabilities needed to=

succeed."

   Could You Have Passed the 8th Grade in 1895? Probably Not.

epoetry conference presentation: (live) typed text


1. Presented: pi.avi :: m3.avi :: m4.avi :: nikuko.asf < > perl j.com ::
fold1 :: seal.mov

2. Typed: between analog & digital -- virtual/imaginary presence:
labor/exhaustion: resonances: filling, overflowing spaces: child/parent
processes: upwellings, interpenetrations, interferences:: nikuko one of
the characters i work with - a virtual or imagtinary presence, written
under duress: these words are Azure Carter's, her text - it's a question
of tthe imaginary, whatever web there is, is internal, internalized;
sometimes things move elsewhere than I intended; it's the result of
sleeplessness, obsession... this goes on and on and on.... so there's a
kind of calling, mayhbe vulnerability, but that's intended, it's
circumscribed, irreal, not real at all; this is another form of the web,
this continuous repetition, manufactured obse4ss;ion; well, nikukol
would answer in this fashion - there is a questio of
institutionalization at work, neuraesthenia,l hjypochar h]ypochondria...

it's as if: is there a doctor in the house - it's as if" something is
being completed, sutured; - it's really all empty talk  -=-- then
there's the fury of the master dancer - this is Foofwa d'Imobilite (real
name) - controlling his movements by virtue of an analog synthesizer -
which also controls the camera positions - exhausting him, bringing
ballet to a completion, releasing it. Meanwhile you might find me
elsewhere doing something - rujnning the perl program, entering
information -- or then maybe there'd be a different kind of loss; we
ended up trying to complete the series - iwanteed to show you this
earlier - i can't see the keyboard; i'[m sailing blind here - there's
something else at work - so we thought about writing on the body - using
the same five camera setup - which controls everything, there's no
preferred viewpoint - like flash in the midst of a miasma - yhou can't
see the controls, the keyboard's burried in the swamp, the contacts are
eroded, there's no way out or - back to the introduction to the
followingt, the piece of hanko, sealing the bodiesl, reclaiming it,
sinking the virtual back into the real - if the equipment continues to
work 0

0 there's an overdetermination at work here - we tried everything -
transforming the gender, moving it around - sealing the bodies or
claiming then: nikuko is sealed by doctor leopold konninger, the doctor
is written on by nikuko, then then - nikuko is written upon by the
doctor - then the heideggerian/derridean erasure - the bodies erased
against one another - so that what remains is the stain or residue of
llanguage, i almost wrote llama - or lama - which is closer to the fact
of this - and then at the end, nikuko sealing, claiming the doctor --
it's always back and forth like that - calling for the doctor, the two
of them furiouslyh locked - it's a circular moment or movement, that
kind of obsession at work here..... i'll move the image - you can see
all of this in the allooottttttttttttttttttted time...... this is
reminiscent of some japanese film, i know i know; it's also godard; the
roots are far too overdetermined - written on the body yes yes yes - but
the reality of it - the d isturbance created by the bodies themselves -
that can't be written out, inscribed, htmled....jumping from one level
to anohter, various practices, interconnected, the only way to work, to
get out, exorcise the demons - they're all over, impenetrable......

3. Perl program live demonstration:

they're horrible; get them away from me; being stains me;
i can't see through the stain; i can't see them; i can't
look away:i'm wearing nothing; i've stolen the clothes off
my back; there's nothing left of them; they're looking
inside themselves:you open my holes; there are people
watching; i can't get away from them; who are you; what do
they want; i'm empty inside: stain of my loose arms around
their necks:

Hi Everyone,

I'm now beginning to work on Readme #5 (due out late this year or
early next), and need especially essays and reviews.

Planned are interviews with: Allison Cobb, Jen Coleman, Alan Davies,
Drew Gardner, Michael Gottlieb, R. Cole Heinowitz, Laird Hunt, P.
Inman, Larry Kearney, William Melvin Kelley, Basil King, Martha King,
Eileen Myles, Eleni Sikelianos, Ron Silliman (part two), Lytle Shaw
and Chris Stroffolino.

I only have two proposed reviews so far, one of Anselm Berrigan's
Integrity & Dramatic Life and one of Chris Stroffolino's Stealer's
Wheel.

I'd especially love to see reviews of: Renee Gladman's Juice, Linh
Dihn's Drunkard Boxing, Prageeta Sharma's Bliss to Fill, Lorenzo
Thomas's Extraordinary Measures, Kevin Davies' Comp., Kevin Varrone's
g-point Almanac, K. Silem Mohammad's Hovercraft, Allison Cobb's Polar
Bear and Desert Fox, Catherine Wagner's Magazine Poems, William
Melvin Kelley's dem (CHP reprint), Janet Hamill's Lost Ceilings,
Eileen Myles' Cool for You, Mike Amnasan's Beyond the Safety of
Dreams, Ted Joans' Teducation, Laura Moriarty's Nude Memoir, Drew
Gardner's Water Tables, Ben Friedlander's A Knot Is Not a Tangle,
Joanna Fuhrman's Freud in Brooklyn, the Talisman Russian poetry
anthology, Lytle Shaw's Cable Factory 20, Granary Books's Joe
Brainard Retrospective ... to suggest a few more-or-less recent
things on my own shelf. Has anyone read any of these & O, would you
be interested in reviewing one or more? Or other more-or-less recent
titles from your own shelf?

I have no essays at this point whatsoever. Do you remember that
Smiths song where Morrissey sings "Shyness is a virtue ..." but then
goes on to advocate for anti-shyness?

Please don't be shy.

Send proposals or completed work to me via the following e-mail
address: <readmemag@excite.com>.

Thanks!

Gary Sullivan

How does this resistance and participaion CROSS/CUT with internet resistance
and participation?  Does it?

I know the answer is bigger than email, but I feel like asking questions
this morning.

Do you know where I can find a review (or two+)
of Lisa Robertson's DEBBIE AN EPIC

(aside from Ben Friedlander's review in
Lagniappe, in which he says that DEBBIE
"is not an epic")

Or would you like to presently offer a mini-review?

I'd appreciate it if you'd cc your response to me
as I'm "no mail" for the time being. Thanks.

Subject:      The Zinc Bar May Lineup & Creation Myth
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The origins of the ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING SERIES are shrouded in
mystery & the stories that purport to relate the details are largely
contradictory. Although Thucydides published an engaging history of the
reading series in the spring of 431BC, only Hesiodus provides us with a
clear account of the actual Zinc Bar formation.

According to the latter, Chaos gave rise to five elements: Gaea, Tartarus,
Erebus, Eros and Night. Gaea & Ouranos had children whom Ouranos treated
cruelly. Gaea encouraged her progeny to rise up against their father. With
a sickle they slew Ouranos, three drops of whose blood fell into the sea
and formed the Curators. They had a dog's head and bat's wings and were the
spirits of revenge & justice. They hounded writers, especially those who
failed to edit their work.

Another drop fell onto an island of earthly paradise in the Hudson River
delta, creating music & poetry from which was born the goddess Zincodite.
For Millennia, the month of May has been reserved for celebrations of
Zincodite's generosity & keen ear. The practice of sacrificing goats &
chickens has gradually given way to holding readings every Sunday at Zinc
Bar. To continue the tradition, may we offer these poets in the hopes that
they please both you & the entire pantheon...

Sexy Rebel

What would I call Meg Ryan?
SEXY REBEL WITH THE GOLDEN GLEAM
for starters, which is easy because
it's already been provided
by the magazine cover
next to my head.
Intriguing...
you could build a whole life that way
with the pre-written thoughts
available on every side.
Have to be careful though,
my next thought is Britney Spears
Das Geschäft mit den Teeny-Stars
and I don't even how what I'm thinking,
though I do know (limiting my worldview
to beautiful women) that Liz Hurley
can't stand to spend a day without getting on the net
...and who can blame her?

Xerox is a registered trade mark and cannot be used in vain.  Or, as the Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual (copyright 1992) puts it: Xerox A trademark for a brand of photocopy machine.  Never a verb.  So, Xerox is a registered trade mark and can
not be used in vain.  And then there's the matter of Kleenex...




Alien Baseball

Morning dream:
a Japanese pitcher
throws the ball
again and
again;

up on his toes
he hurls himself into the pitch,
like the gear of a watch
his body falls forward
with relatively little strain
on his arm.

The surprise
(for me) is in
the stands, where
flat faced, big eyed
aliens watch.
Welcome to the day.

Radio Storm
There's a storm on the radio,
snowflakes falling through the airwaves;
it's coming my way,
toward the street I'm driving down
in the pre-dawn darkness
where from the lone brightly illumined window
of the small office building
one word (cry or call) on rarely used frequencies
escapes:
pho-to-copy
its full-voiced insistence buffets the car,
then, like a bird whose visits have their own time and reason
is gone.

for two people who have decided
to strew the pavement with broken glass
crumple fenders
and talk to the police.

        -- They're depending on me
to help raise 785 million dollars
before 6:30.
If I enjoy these priceless programs
I'll be glad to pay.
For a contribution of just 1.5 million
I'll get this marvellous
hand thrown

(by respected local ceramicist
Barth Gilbreath
-- a limited edition).

Napkin Poem

This is my napkin poem
writ at the coffee shop
where the Arab girl at the next table
says "all computers, all computers
in there, no people doing it"
before she lapses back into Arabic
where I cannot follow,
and a girl at the table past that
says, oddly enough, "Oscoda"
(a lakeshore town in Northern Michigan)
and nothing else about Oscoda
can be discerned in the ambient buzz
except I guess computers are doing it there too
...no people?

I agree.  While I wish them the best of luck in their strike, seems to me
this would better fit a =B3lifestyles/concerns of college instructors=B2 list o=
r
something.  While =B3professor=B2 and =B3poet=B2 often share the same flesh, this i=

the =B3poetics list=B2 not =B3professor list.=B2

Anyhow, I=B9m just a neophyte shooting my mouth off, but what I hoped to find
here when I signed on a couple weeks back, that cannot be found elsewhere,
is info on contemporary poetry/experimental writing world to broaden my
horizons as reader/writer/art appreciator/creator.

David Chirot=B9s post on relation of film to writing, with its examples,
names, and suggested further reading, is a fine example of the sort of post
I hoped to see.=20

That Smiths' song is titled "Ask" -

the verse you're referring to:

"Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to"

Can't stand for Morrissey to be misquoted.

Murat, Alan -

I just want to say that there is more to art than connections, analogy,
linkages, attractions.  If there's nothing in what is being linked and there
is only something in the link itself, then does the link really exist
anyway?  I mean, is a link really a link if it links nothing?  I don't know
who wrote this but the statement sounds like a silly and blind pronouncement
rife with pomo utopianism.  Sorry to be so frank, but I know you are both
very intelligent people who can stomach my strong language without too much
resentment.  Call me a late modernist if you will, but surely you must agree
there's more to literature than just connection.  Let's not forget that what
is connected, the things in themselves, are just as dubious or certain as
the reality of the links.  There is much to connection, surely, *but only
where there are at least two things to be connected*.

More important than a link is the very *act* of making a link.  This is why
I'm so critical of hypertext, because people have left the act of making
leaps and relationships to machines and not to humans, making machines
dictate wondrous turns in art.  *Linking* is more important than a link in
itself, yes?  And that very human act of creating a link while experiencing
a piece of art is an act of creation itself, a wondrous act best left to our
imaginations, not to some stern logical control unit and CPU (which forms
perhaps a Monarchy made of sand, as in silicon).  I feel we must make
opportunities for people to make their own links, however arbitrary the
links may be, that there are things in out art than the things that connect
things.

Thanks,
Patrick

"Thanks to you (and no doubt to the old bard or bards) I see what a
powerful and splendid poem 'Beowulf' is.  When I came to those sea
beasts sunning themselves on the ledges I gasped  with wonder!  Your
verse treads a nice line between the strict old  measure and something
looser. . . Congratulations!"

at Cody's Bookstore

2154 Telegraph Ave
Berkeley, Ca

Gloria Frym & Lewis Warsh will be reading from
their new books, HOMELESS AT HOME
and THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD, both
published by Creative Arts Book Company

Praise for HOMELESS AT HOME:

Gloria Frym's Homeless at Home is an elevated triumph. A deeply
moving, astutely passionate work of the highest integrity and poetic
presence. These poems not only grieve the past that was and can never
be, but focus with alacrity on present states of debris and possibility.
Their measured rage and acceptance unfold a stately and alarming poetry,
understated yet overt, compassionate yet resistant. A deeply intelligent
work of profound demand and reward from a writer of immense principle
and engagement.
       --David Meltzer

Letters, meditations, pages broadcast into what may or may not be the
'right earth'--Gloria Frym's poem sequence Homeless at Home comes to us on
wavelengths of darkly humorous lyricism capable of transmitting states of
longing, wonder, and rage at the injustices of the human polis with clarity
and wit.  As we tune in, these thoughts and sounds, intimate and vatic by
turns,
carry us way beyond their epistolary framework into the great continuum
of poetry's perennial arguments with existence, and back again into an
intimate and welcoming human place.
      --Anselm Hollo

A voice of lineage illumination writes home to the heart of 'a world that
won't end when you do.' A private language made public. Sharply social
insights of the moment's culture. Are you listening? It's for you.
     --Joanne Kyger


Praise for THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD:

Given the complexity of this world and all the myriad people who are
in it, these poems are poignantly articulate experiments, which reach
out endlessly, day or night, so as to feel another is still there too. If
one can ever doubt, Lewis Warsh proves again that the world exists,
even after all is said and done.
     --Robert Creeley

The discrete (though hardly discreet) sentences in Lewis Warsh's new
book actually merge to describe something like the origin of the
world. As he says, 'Connect the dots to create a picture of something
unimaginable.'
     --John Ashbery

It's incumbent on us to watch closely and observe well--to do otherwise
is to miss what's happening. In this wonderful new book, Lewis Warsh
sets out through a landscape swept with occurrence. As he looks about,
somber image and glimpsed exegesis play off each other and the
works unfold. Their lines flicker and figure; they resemble the light-
images of which movies are made. They leap, fade, reappear--figuring out
the world. As Lewis Warsh brilliantly reveals, this is the origin, always
ongoing, of the world.
     --Lyn Hejinian

New From Avec Books:
Pain
Christopher Reiner


In PAIN, writer, editor and filmmaker Christopher Reiner offers a
contemporary version of Charles Baudelaire's _Paris Spleen_, retaining =
all
the subtlety, perverse charm, and withering social commentary of the
original-and even managing to sneak in the angels and devils that were =
his
forerunner's specialty.  As with the great French poet, Reiner presents =
a
world where bourgeois hypocrisy and emotional alienation stem more from
laziness and boredom than from any active (ideological) passion.  But =
what
shocks the reader here is no longer Baudelaire's transgressive subject
matter (after all, this is the 21st century) but the discovery that =
screwy
logic and grim nihilism can still achieve such seductive expression =
(after
all, this is safe, rational, moralistic America).  "If there's a devil, =
his
force is to hold us back, to convince us to resist taking part, to keep =
us
quiet and worried."

*

Christopher Reiner's stories or prose poems-I'm not sure how to classify
them-are subtle and psychologically astute, fascinating. They draw you =
in
with their apparent simplicity, but it is into a conundrum, a riddle =
always
just beyond your understanding. They leave you wanting more-not more =
from
them but more like them.
-Rae Armantrout

If Baudelaire's Paris Spleen had been written by an avant-garde =
filmmaker
living in modern-day Hollywood, what kind of text would it be? A =
sequence
of narratives carefully covering their own footprints? A series of jokes
told skillfully enough to avoid their own punch lines? Would it be =
filled
with the kind of self-deflating subversion that so skillfully fills the
pages of Chris Reiner's Pain? "Originally, when the aliens came down, =
they
let us ask for specific things we wanted. But they were so depressed by
what we asked for that they made us forget it ever happened and they
started giving us what they assumed we needed. So it's only partly their
fault that they were all wrong." Reading Pain is like trying not to =
laugh
in a movie theater where everyone else is weeping.
-Stephen-Paul Martin

Christopher Reiner's Pain casts itself into the world then examines
whatever has stuck to its line of questioning.  His self is a flitting
hybrid, a cross between Andre=B4 Breton and Garrison Keillor, taking its
queasy measure in relation to the received messages of the culture =
around
it.  "Start to see uneasy between this person and yourself."  In Pain
'happy' is not assumed to be a good thing. Reiner's philosophical gems
don't shine from a place of easy entitlement.  Pain  is a question in
constant revision and the answer, like pieces of an almost-solved =
puzzle,
lunges in and out of view.
-Diane Ward

Christopher Reiner lives in Los Angeles. His previous full-length volume =
of
poetry, Ogling Anchor, was published by Avec Books in 1998. He was the
editor of Witz: A Journal of Contemporary Poetics from 1991 to 1999. A
member of the Drift Group of experimental filmmakers, his recent video
works include Stage Sleep, The Wedding Song, and The Man Who Ate a Car.

Subject: 8th Grade Final Exam: Salina, Kansas - 1895


Here's something interesting. I know I'd have to repeat 8th grade again.
Wow.
Or I'd be like Jethro on the "Beverly Hillbillies": 'I has six grad
ejukashun."

THE 8th GRADE TEST IN 1895

This is the eighth-grade final exam from 1895 from Salina, Kansas. It  was
taken from the original document on file at the Smoky Valley
Genealogical Society and Library in Salina, Kansas and reprinted by the
_Salina Journal_:

   "In 1895 the 8th grade was considered upper level education.  Many
children
quit school as soon as they could master the basic fundamentals
of the 3R's (reading, writing and arithmetic). Most never went past the 3rd
or
4th grade. That's all you needed for the farm and most city jobs. Child
labor
laws were not in existence yet. Additionally today's education has much more
focus on technology and sociology than the grammar and geography of old.
It's
a  different world with different requirements and capabilities needed to
succeed."

   Could You Have Passed the 8th Grade in 1895? Probably Not.

On Tuesday, May 15th, from 6-8 pm

The Rotunda Gallery,
located at 33 Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights,
hosts a reading
to celebrate the publication of

(the invisible city)

an anthology of art and poetry inspired by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities
edited by Marcella Durand, Richard O'Russa and Karoline Schleh,
to be published by Erato Press.

Readers will include:

Anselm Berrigan
Marcella Durand
Joe Elliot
Betsy Fagin
Laird Hunt
Rachel Levitsky
Pattie McCarthy
Lytle Shaw
Edwin Torres
Kevin Varrone
Karen Weiser
and others

This reading is held in conjunction with the Rotunda Gallery's current
exhibition, Cities & Desire, on view through May 19th. Using keywords from
an evocative passage in Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, the curators were
led to a range of work by various artists in the Rotunda Gallery's Slide
Registry. While some of the artists depict intimate interiors, others use
models to distort perspective and the experience of place. An exhibition
with literary undertones, Cities & Desire offers alternative and divergent
ways to look at the spaces in which we live.

For more information and directions to the Rotunda Gallery, please visit
http://www.brooklynX.org/rotunda

From the Introduction to (the invisible city): "...driven mad by the low
barometric pressure of New Orleans, Karoline Schleh, Richard O'Russa and
myself thought of an enormous collaboration between artists and poets, to be
handprinted and letterpressed, then handbound and distributed to the
contributors and a few museums. However, in the cooler light of New York, we
realized that such an undertaking would be several decades in the making, so
in the meantime, decided to jump ahead, New York-style, and publish a
shinier, more legitimate version of (the invisible city). So, like Erato
Press, which operates with one foot in the secretive and mysterious New
Orleans swamp and the other on the hard-edged New York concrete, this is a
dual project of artists and writers, lovers of Italo Calvino's fantastic
book, made in the hopes of inspiring more such fruitful juxtapositions."

For more information on (the invisible city) (which should, barring
last-minute adverse occurences, should be available at the reading), e-mail
either Marcella Durand at mdurand@sprynet.com or Richard O'Russa at
orussa@yahoo.com.

Richard,

Actually, what I was doing was not a criticism of alan. I find a good deal of
what he is doing very interesting. It was an antiphonal response in the
tradition of some Eastern folk forms -also something John Webster does (as
echoes) in "The Duchess of Malfi" (I think).

A Reminder!

Internationally known writer and UCSD Regents Lecturer HARRY MATHEWS
will be reading this Wednesday, April 25, as part of the New Writing
Series at UCSD.

The reading takes place at 4:30pm in the Visual Arts Performance
Space, UCSD campus, and is free and open to the public.

An early member of the New York School of poets, writers, and
artists, HARRY MATHEWS founded, with John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch,  and
James Schuyler, the influential periodical _Locus Solus_ , and later
became a central member of the renowned experimental group Oulipo
(Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle) that included, among others,
Italo Calvino, Raymond Queneau, and Georges Perec. Internationally
celebrated as a novelist, poet, translator, and experimentalist,
Mathews works include _Cigarettes: A Novel_, _Singular Pleasures_
(with illustrations by Francesco Clemente), _A Mid-Season Sky: Poems
1954-1991, and _Selected Declarations of Dependence_. He is visiting
San Diego from his home in Paris on a University of California
Regents Lectureship.


       "Why, is Pan in-flect? You ask. Once it was n't,
    then home the missions, be fore soldats and buyrs,
    monks mad for lingual avance. Yet, hlever, they
    forse not theyr linguage up on us, ownly show, the
    vantage of its struttures - of horse, we are
    peedisposed to these. They show howhow one
    word can to-be many, with a little twists, and
    we're reasn-like and order-most and the cort
    adops this eduhation..."

      - from "The Sinking of the Odradek Stadium."


    "Throughout Mathews' work, his self-reflexivity
    is thoroughly grounded in macabre humor and
    encyclopedic speculations rendered all the more
    strange through his radically constrictive procedures.
    To read Harry Mathews' work [...] is to consider an
    astonishingly varied and rich collection of inquiries
    into the concept of authorship and the function of
    writing..."

      - Lytle Shaw, on Mathews's novel _The Journalist_, in _Idiom 2_

Join us for this evening of readings by a unique international company of
poets, with appearances by Katarina Frostenson, visiting from Sweden, Tor
Obrestad from Norway, Lutz Seiler from former East Germany, and Taylor
Brady of San Francisco.  The Poetry Center is co-presenting this evening's

*  KATERINA FROSTENSON was born in Stockholm in 1953.  Her writings include
several award-winning volumes of poetry, lyric prose, eight plays (four
monodramas and four longer plays) and the libretto to the opera Staden
(City).  Elected to the Swedish Academy in 1992, her most recent
publication was a  collection of poems in December 2000.  She has worked
since 1980 as a free-lance editor and translator.  During the early 1980s,
she lived in Paris for several  years, and has translated from French into
Swedish works by Henri Michaux, Marguerite Duras, and Georges Bataille.

*  TOR OBRESTAD was born on a farm in Norway in 1938, and was raised and
trained to be a farmer.  His first book of poems (awarded the Norwegian
Debut Prize) and a book of short stories appeared in 1966, followed by a
work on William Blake in 1967.  His book Sauda! Streik! (Strike!), 1972,
was made into a movie.  Among almost 40 books, a combined photo and text
work, Jaeren: Fire & Sky, was recently published in English.  Since 1990 he
has worked as a journalist and traveled widely (e.g., Eastern Europe,
including Kosova, Macedonia, and Albania; and recently in Yemen).  He has
translated the poetry of Robert Bly and Raymond Carver into Norwegian, and
recently had published a book in Arabic and Norwegian with exiled Yemeni
poet Mansur Rajih.

*  LUTZ SEILER was born in Gera (former East Germany) in 1963.  He lives in
Berlin and Wilhelmshorst.  He has become known in recent years for his
popular books of poetry Das verlorene Alphabet (The Lost Alphabet) and
Sprache im technischen Zeitalter (Language In The Age Of Technics).
Co-editor of the literary magazine Moosbrand, in 1999 he was given an award
from the State of Brandenburg and the Kranichsteiner Prize for Literature.

* TAYLOR BRADY was born in Dunedin, Florida in 1972.  Since that time he
has lived in Tampa, Sarasota, Brooklyn, Buffalo, and, since 1998, San
=46rancisco.  For the past five years he has been writing an extended serial
poem, To Not, whose parts include lyric, prose poetry, a novel, and a
series of short essays.  Sections of this project have appeared in several
journals, and in the recent chapbook 33549.  A chapbook containing earlier
work, Is Placed/Leaves, appeared in 1996.  The first book-length
installment of the To Not writings, Microclimates, is forthcoming this year
from Krupskaya (San Francisco).

Injury and arrest reports mount as situation calms down

INJURY AND ARREST REPORTS MOUNT AS SITUATION CALMS DOWN

By Cliff Pearson, co-chair
Green Party of Dallas County
Dallas, Texas USA

(QUEBEC CITY, Quebec) - The state of emergency declared last night for
the headquarters of CMAQ, the Quebec Independent Media Center, has been
rescinded.

At approximately 10:44 p.m. EDT, members of the Quebec Legal Collective,
a group of attorneys volunteering their services to protesters, arrived
at the newsroom in case CMAQ personnel required legal assistance.

At approximately 11:00 p.m. EDT, approximately 20 riot police fired
rubber bullets down the stairs into the CMAQ foyer, injuring one
activist. He suffered wounds to his leg and was treated at the scene by
medics. CMAQ staff and reporters responded to the police assault by
barricading the doors.

By 11:06 p.m. EDT, the police retreated down Rue Cote d'Abraham to
confront protesters.

At 11:24 p.m. EDT, CMAQ had to block the doors with clothes and blankets
to prevent tear gas -- presumably fired at the activists -- from seeping
into the newsroom.

At 12:57 a.m. EDT, CMAQ reporters confirmed via eyewitnesses that the
Medical Center had been tear-gassed by riot police. The clinic was moved
to the CMAQ building.

As of 1:29 a.m. EDT -- Sunday, April 22, 2001 -- CMAQ staffers confirmed
that the young man shot in the throat with a plastic bullet last night is
in critical but stable condition at St. Foy Hospital in Quebec City,
Quebec.

Other reports of serious injuries and police brutality continued to mount
all last night and this morning and afternoon. People who had attended
the previous protests in Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia
continue to insist that the situation here is worse than all prior
protests.

One of the more serious reports is that a man suffered eye injuries after
being struck in the face by shrapnel from an exploding tear gas canister.

The Quebec Legal Collective reports confirmation that more than 30
canisters of "noxious gases," such as tear gas and pepper spray, were
fired in various places in the city last night.

Besides gassing, many of the acts of police brutality include the firing
of rubber and plastic bullets at protesters. Quebec Legal Collective
observers have collected whole bullets and shells from the ground.

The legal team also reports the use of metal "bean bags" shot from police
weapons. Additionally, there is one confirmed report of a man with a
broken arm hit by a tear gas canister reportedly fired at close range
(less than one meter, or two feet).

As for arrests, the Quebec Legal Collective confirmed -- by receiving
calls from jailed prisoners themselves -- a total of 430 arrested
protesters. Of these, 250 were arrested between the hours of 6:00 p.m.
and 3:00 a.m last night.

Most of the arrests took place near Rue St. Joseph and Rue de l'Couronne.
These streets are several city blocks from the security perimeter and are
supposedly in designated "green" zones -- areas of low-risk of arrest,
where no illegal behavior was to take place.

Some of the protesters arrested yesterday and Friday have been released.
The charges are varied, and are mostly for minor infractions such as
criminal mischief and "being suspect," a dubious term that does not
appear to be a legal criminal charge.

Patrick Deschenes, the missing roommate of my Canadian host, has still
not been positively located. But at approximately 8:00 a.m. EDT, our
host, Sarah Gognan, was told that others of her friends arrested in the
same incident are now out of jail. These friends confirmed that Mr.
Deschenes is in the jail.

Jaggi Singh, the activist reported kidnapped by police on Friday, is
still in jail and police say he will not be released until Wednesday,
April 25, 2001. Police have not said why he will be detained so long.

At 1:30 p.m. EDT this afternoon, an attorney from the Quebec Legal
Collective came to the CMAQ newsroom to announce that he is filing a
class action lawsuit on behalf of those who have suffered civil rights
abuses and police brutality. He is looking for victims of police
brutality to interview.

The Quebec Legal Collective reports they have received more than 30
reports of people being detained on the streets and questioned by riot
police.

They also report they have spoken with and received reports that many
vans, buses, and cars have been stopped. Reports include incidents of
police unlawfully demanding identification from all passengers in cars,
unlawful searches of people on the street who are not under arrest and do
not consent to the search, and the ticketing of people who have tear gas
masks -- none of which are illegal acts under the Canadian Charter of
Government.

Additionally, the Quebec Legal Collective reports numerous eyewitness
reports of over a dozen "targeted arrests" of protesters. Police have
made targeted, pre-planned arrests of specific people, without regard to
their currentactions -- presumably as "preventive arrests."

For example, the legal team reports three police cars pulled up on the
side of the road, jumped out and tackled a person to the ground. In
another situation witnessed by legal observers, two undercover police
vans picked up three people as they were walking peacefully by a gas
station.

Finally, the legal team reports that more than 300 people from the United
States were turned back at the border attempting to enter Canada. People
turned back had their personal belongings (including phonebooks,
literature, and journals) photocopied and were interrogated about their
political beliefs and activities before they were turned away. Over 15
people were detained at the New York and Vermont borders and have not yet
been released.

Actions today are decidedly calmer so far. Activists are apparently
centering their attention around "solidarity protests" outside the
Orainsville prison, the Quebec City facility where those arrested last
night are currently jailed. Protesters are shouting outside the prison
walls for the unconditional release of all the remaining protesters who
are imprisoned.

There are no scheduled actions planned for the security perimeter fence,
as there were yesterday, but there are reports of tear gassings at Rene
Levesque near the site of yesterday's initial fence destruction. CMAQ
independent reporters have been dispatched to investigate.

More details as they become available. Minute-by-minute reports continue
to filter in to the CMAQ newsroom.

Reporting from the protest in Quebec City, I'm Cliff Pearson, Quebec IMC.

Dear friends,

The deadline for contributing to the 100 Days project - an anthology of
politically activated writings and drawings, responding to the first rumbles
from our brand-spanking administration - has, technically, passed.  I'm now
beginning the lengthy process of typesetting what has turned out to be an
encouragingly large array of material.  I may still be able to include
submissions that reach me within the next few days: so hurry up and send in
your dissent!

Please feel free to contact me, also, with any questions about the project.

Best wishes,
Andrea Brady
(Barque Press)


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
BARQUE PRESS invites you to contribute to a special number:

        ONE HUNDRED DAYS.

To be published on 30 April, 100 days after George W Bush was inaugurated.

We urgently request critical responses to the first centenary of this new
administration, from writers and artists in the US and around the world.
Poetry, prose, satire, collage, red marginalia, infuriated scribblings,
utopias, lament cycles, editorials, comic monologues, vexed encyclopedias, sick
cartoons, dream poems, scatologies, prophesies, journalistic digs, grammatical
treatises and any misshapen deformed genre conceived in his image, all welcome.

If we receive enough contributions, the volume will be distributed and
deposited, as a feeble testament to creative dissent in a terrible time.

Please send submissions, questions or suggestions by return (to this e-mail
address: ab204@cam.ac.uk) or to: A. Brady, Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge,
CB2 1TA, ENGLAND.  (www.barquepress.com)

Please also forward this invitation to all able-minded potential participants.

DENISE DUHAMEL
author of Queen for A Day: New and Selected Poems and many other books of
poetry
will give a reading
at HAVERFORD COLLEGE'S SHARPLESS AUDITORIUM
370 Lancaster Ave
Haverford, PA
on
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25, at 7:30 pm.

Directions: www.haverford.edu/hcweb/hcdirect.html or 610.896.1000

Denise Duhamel is the author of numerous collections of poetry, including
Queen For A Day, Kinky, Girl Soldier, The Star Spangled Banner and many
others. An NEA Fellow and assistant professor at Florida International
University, her poems have been widely anthologized, including in the KGB
Bar Book of Poems, American Poetry: The Next Generation, The Barbie
Chronicles: A Real Doll Turns Forty, and in four volumes of the Best
American Poetry.

"Frank O'Hara said something about only three American poets being better
than the movies, but I think Denise Duhamel would make him add a
fourth!"--Bill Knott

"Denise Duhamel is a red-headed, red-lipped wild woman, a human and
humane poet who isn't afraid to tackle any subject: violence, racism,
AIDS, bulimia, childlessness, the myth of Bluebeard, the phenomenon of
Barbie. Queen for a Day is exuberant, brazen, bold, honest as hell,
audaciously unpretentious and outrageously self-referential, a Frank
O'Hara meets Lucille Ball meets Sandra Bernhard of a book: sin
verguenza!"--Dorianne Laux

"Denise Duhamel's
poems are kinky
she's like a girl
soldier some days a woman
with two vaginas on others
I like the way she belts out
'The Star-Spangled Banner'
at the ballpark her
affectionate embrace
of the world's
full of grace
(though the world
itself is not)
and her titles do
what titles should do
they make you
want to read
the texts they head"

Sorry to have pestered you, though I may do so again in future.  There's
always the delete key, you know.  Many thanks to those who back and
front-channeled their support to me and Juliana and, by extension, to Steve
Carll and Bill Luoma.

Poets' flesh and professors' bodies so often being the same, I thought I'd
communicate how effectively they are being flayed here.  Without education
there are very few readers or writers of poetry, even if not all poets are
teachers.  I could say a lot more about the death of the poets in the
schools program in this state, which it seems to me is intimately related to
our current woes.  The governor, after all, wants education that generates
revenues.

A recent question from an LA Times reporter to me, "is WS Merwin a major
poet?" seems far less relevant to the health of poetry in this state than
does the governor's attempt to scrap public education.

But enough.

Susan

I agree.  While I wish them the best of luck in their strike, seems to me
this would better fit a ³lifestyles/concerns of college instructors² list or
something.  While ³professor² and ³poet² often share the same flesh, this is
the ³poetics list² not ³professor list.²

Anyhow, I¹m just a neophyte shooting my mouth off, but what I hoped to find

David Chirot¹s post on relation of film to writing, with its examples,

Dodie Bellamy is a novelist, critic and cultural journalist.  She has
written a novel, The Letters of Mina Harker (Hard Press, 1998), a
collection of memoirs, Feminine Hijinx (Hanuman, 1990), an epistolary
collaboration on AIDS with the late Sam D'Allesandro, Real (Talisman
House, 1994), and three smaller books, Answer (Leave Books, 1993),
Broken English (Meow, 1996), and Hallucinations (Meow, 1997). One of
the original "New Narrative" writers of the early and mid 80's,
Bellamy has worked hard to bring together the sometimes disparate
paths of art, poetry and the novel, including a triumphant five-year
stint as director of the seminal San Francisco writing lab, Small
Press Traffic.  In recognition of her efforts she won the prestigious
Bay Guardian "Goldie" Award for Literature in 1998.

San Francisco poet Taylor Brady’s poetry and prose has appeared in a
number of journals, including Kenning, COMBO, The Queen Street
Quarterly, and Mirage #4/Period(ical). His chapbook Is Placed/Leaves
was published by Meow Press (Buffalo, 1996. More recent work from a
novel-in-progress was published as the chapbook 33549 by Leroy Books
in San Francisco, 2000. The novel, Microclimates, is forthcoming from
Krupskaya Books this summer. Brady has recently presented readings and
performances at Small Press Traffic, Modern Times Books, and New
Langton Arts, where he was a recipient of the 2000 Bay Area Award for
Literature.

Jess Hilliard’s recent solo show at the San Francisco Arts Commission
Gallery was called Jess Hilliard: An Undying Fascination and Love for
All Animals, Especially the Cute Ones, with drawings by Jess and
featured works by Dieselhead singer/artist Virgil Shaw, Chris
Johanson, Bob Linder and artist Alicia McCarthy, as well as readings
and from Hilliard's book, Hi Friend. He is collaborating with
Cleveland Leffler.

N'HEAT is a hot mixture of ass-bouncing electronica and video art.
This four-member crew would like to be known by their N'HEAT names;
Bustamental, Oranjaboom, Mastermind and House, but rumour has it they
are all recognizable members of the thriving alternative arts scene
here in San Francisco.

Kathryn Williamson is a performance artist whose work investigates
different contexts within and outside of her body based on the idea of
endurance and testing boundaries. She challenges and entertains the
audience with a fresh look at the seemingly obvious and mundane, while
hearkening back to classic'70s performance art.  Ms. Williamson has
performed nationally, as well as many venues in the Bay Area including
The Lab, four walls, and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.  In 2000 she
received the Bay Area Award for Performance from New Langton Arts.  In
the fall she will attempt to vacuum living rooms across the United
States.

c. "Bing Bang Art festival" New Orleans,  September 2001

Once legalized by Judge Loretta M. Norris of the superior court of the
State of California for the County of San Francisco on 20 January
1998, e-mael has been safely administered to the public locally in
spaces such as the San Francisco Art institute, the Luggage Store,
Intersection for the Arts, Theater Rhinoceros, the Oakland Museum of
California, Galería de la Raza, La Peña Cultural Center, Somarts
Cultural Center and Southern Exposure.

have you had a chance to look at Barrett's paper on linking and his comments
on Stafford's 'deterministic' view of mind.  I try to link the visual and
verbal in a way that is neither random nor determined by the structure of
the hardware/software but it is not easy.

Andrea,
     I may have missed this when first announced.  I have been involved with
an email and website citizens' group campaigning to get a drug restored to
the market after the FDA raised questions based on a Purblic Citizen
petition. It's a complicated thing that I am going to try to turn into a
poetic symphony.  The url will be
http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/fgid.htm
when it is finished.  Maybe you could put this in.

I heard Charles Bernstein's essay on NPR and it made my day, especially as
I had just come out of a particularly pandering workshop experience with a
poet who shall go unnamed.  This essay made me very proud to be part of
this listserv!

As, I must say, have the recent postings about issues of political import
and social justice, including the reports from the U Hawai'i strike and
the anti-Bush anthology.  I recently saw Minnie Bruce Pratt read her work,
and really she mostly talked about various political issues she's involved
in.  Her poetry is not the kind of thing I usually go for, but I have to
say I was struck by how *relevant*, in an obvious way, it was, and how
closely she's melded her poetry life with her political life.  Afterwards
I asked her about this, about how she brought the two together, and she
basically responded by saying it is only in my insulated little academic
poetry world where poetry and politics AREN'T united.  I don't
neccessarily agree with this -- I still think certain kinds of poetries
and politics are kept separate, and anyway, even if you're only talking
about "academic" (and what does that mean, really? experimental?
confessional? lyric?) poetry, it's still an issue to think about that
should not be easily dismissed: how does one be an artist and an activist?
To me this is really a question of how best can one live one's life.  Art
and activism are two of the most crucial elements in my life.  This is
obviously true for many people on this list, judging from the posts.

Ok, now, disclaimer.  This was written quickly and off the cuff.  I have
been reluctant to post opinionated things of this sort in the past because
of the intimidation factor: I didn't want to be the recipient of flames or
attacks.  I'm sure there is much in the above that could be denied or is
somehow incorrect.  Nonetheless.  I like seeing political (and, I'll admit
it, by that I mean "lefty") postings on this list.  I think it's
important. I have great admiration for list members who are doing
something to make the world safer, more just, cleaner, more complex, etc.
And I'll stop now before someone throws something at me.

Arielle

Murat. I see that. I fired my guns then looked back at what you'sd said.
Then I thought...no that's not exactly an "attack". And the other thought
was: well, even if it was, he has a perfect right to criticise. So you (of
course you dont need me to tell you) you had a perfect right to do what you
werent doing! My error. Interesting response by you anycase. Regards,
Richard.

 .aural performance #001
 ----------
 Sound-text exhibit & performance
 by AARON LEVY
 followed by open discussion

 >> Sunday April 29th, 7:30 pm <<
    11th Floor, Social Sciences, English Departmental Lounge
    University of Calgary, Canada

 .aural addresses anonymity, the archival, and the idea of language as
 sound, engaging new writing, printing and musical technologies.

 .aural is the result of a four-month collaboration between Aaron Levy
 and Andrew Zitcer, in Philadelphia.  It began with culling 130 aphorisms
 from the 8-part spoken diaries of John Cage, then modulating and
 manipulating these aphorisms as digitized sound files. Aaron and Andrew
 then programmed their sound-file manipulations to be engaged by scanner
 "pen" passing across printed barcodes. A large book made for the exhibit
 features the printed barcodes. Exhibit participants will be invited to
 trigger the sound files by opening the book and passing the scanner pen
 across the various barcodes, releasing composed sound-texts based on
 Cage's voice. Monitors in the room will display streaming text by Cage,
 incessantly renewing, at random, the order and flow of John Cage's
 culled language.

 AARON LEVY is a photographer and writer living in Philadelphia. He most
 recently visited Calgary to present a Transparency Machine event
 (http://slought.net/exp/transparency/) and coordinate live audiocasting
 for PhillyTalks #18 (http://phillytalks.org). He runs the nonprofit
 online multimedia umbrella arts initiative, Slought Networks
 (http://slought.net), where many of his own works can be found.

 This presentation is the inaugural event of CalgaryWritersHouse, a
 soon-to-be web-based initiative of arts programming coordinated by Derek
 Beaulieu, Louis Cabri, Aaron Levy, Andrea Strudensky and Fred Wah. Stay
 tuned to http://calgarywritershouse.com.

Starcherone Books announces the republication of a classic of postmodern fiction, Raymond Federman's The Voice in the Closet.  The text is newly revised in both French and English by Federman and features images by artist Terri Katz Kasimov from her "Federman Series."  There is also a foreword by Gerard Bucher.

The Voice in the Closet is available in Buffalo at Talking Leaves Books and Rust Belt Books.  The title is Starcherone's second publication, following my own Endorsed by Jack Chapeau.  Both are also available on amazon.com.  Forthright requests for review copies will be honored.

"This is a book of unusual power, written as carefully as a poem, demanding that the reader 're-scan' every step of the way . . . .  The Voice in the Closet astonishes partly because nothing in Federman's previous work, with its writerly and bookish determination somehow to demonstrate the world of writing as, say, Derrida and Lacan envisage and describe it, nothing in his previous work prepares us for the obsessive immediacy of this." - Peter Quartermain, Chicago Review, 1980.

Perhaps interestingly, about your Subject Header "Tarpits of Poetry,"---

the use of "tarpits" as a derogatory/cautionary term etymologically emerged not
from what you might expect, a realistic dread of pratfalls into tarpits, say,
the infamous La Brea tarpits all those poor dinosaurs fell into {glub! glub!}
but from a Biblical allusion (Gen. 14:10, KJV: "And the vale of Siddim [was
full] of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there;
and they that remained fled to the mountain"), you Good Book thumpers.

I forget which critic made that point and about which author's
to-me-previously-undetectable allusion: perhaps about a use of "tarpits" in
Proust, ---or Wilde? ---or Winkelmann?  ---or---?

As a Kelly Writers House Fellow, on April 23, 2001, June Jordan gave a
reading from her memoir, SOLDIER, and from her poetry, including new,
uncollected work. The event was recorded digitally and is now linked to the
Writers House web site:

        www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/webcasts/jordan.html

On April 24, 2001, Jordan returned to the Writers House for an
interview/conversation moderated by Al Filreis, Faculty Director of the
Writers House. This program was webcast live. A recording of that webcast is
available at the same site noted above.

We have also made available excerpts of Jordan reading individual poems at
the Writers House. The two excerpts are:

        * "Focus in Real Time" (from KISSING GOD GOODBYE)
        * "Poem about My Rights" (the widely anthologized poem)

Teachers of poetry are encouraged to link these audio-and-video versions of
the poems to course sites and/or to use them with students.

For more about Writers House webcasts, including an archive featuring, among
many others, Tony Kushner, Slavoj Zizek, Kenneth Goldsmith, John Wideman,

A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:
Please note the following date and time change for Gary Lenhart's workshop:

Tuesday, May 8th at 8 pm
THE ART OF LISTENING: POEMS AND CRITICISM
A WORKSHOP TAUGHT BY GARY LENHART
Public service announcement, short cut to publication, pedantic gloss,
frantic jumping up and down for attention-criticism can be all these things,
and boring too. How does one make it something closer to heart, less
declamatory, and more responsive? Gary Lenhart is the author of several
collections of poems including Father and Son Night (1999) from Hanging
Loose Press. He edited The Teachers & Writers Guide to William Carlos
Williams (Teachers & Writers, 1998) and Clinch: Selected Poems of Michael
Scholnick (Coffee House Press, 1998).

This week and next week at the Poetry Project:

Wednesday, April 25th at 8 pm
YUKIHIDE MAESHIMA HARTMAN AND CAROL SZAMATOWICZ
Born in Japan and long prominent in the New York poetry world, Yukihide
Maeshima Hartman is the author of several collections of poetry, including
Ping, New Poems, and Coloring Book. "Yuki Hartman orders his images around
with the temerity of a lion tamer. He's as gifted a poet as they come,"
writes Charles North. Carol Szamatowicz is the author of two collections of
poems, Cats & Birds and Zoop (The Owl Press, 2001). Her work has appeared in
Lingo, The Germ, and The World.

Thursday, April 26th at 8 pm
A TRIBUTE TO GREGORY CORSO
"Corso is a poet's poet, his verse pure velvet, close to John Keats for our
time, exquisitely delicate in manners of the Muse," wrote Allen Ginsberg.
With readings and talks by over 35 writers, including Patti Smith, Jim
Carroll, Ed Sanders, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Eileen Myles, John S.
Hall, David Amram, and many others. Celebrated Beat poet Gregory Corso died
on January 17, 2001. Born in Greenwich Village in 1930, Corso hooked up with
Allen Ginsberg and the other Beat poets at Columbia University in the 1940s.
He moved to San Francisco in 1956, quickly fitting into the Beat scene
there. Corso's poetic voice was simple, colloquial, funny, and
unpretentious. Among his books of poetry and prose are Gasoline (1956), The
Happy Birthday of Death (1960), The American Express (1961), Elegiac
Feelings, American (1970), and Mindfield (1991). Admission is $7, $5 for
Poetry Project members.

Friday, April 27th at 9 pm

ELENI SIKELIANOS AND TONY TOWLE
Eleni Sikelianos is the author of several poetry books and chapbooks.
Earliest Worlds (Coffee House Press, 2001) is her first major collection.
Writes Alice Notley of Earliest Worlds, "An original and beautiful poetry,
always discovering its own grammar and name, its own secrets. The poetry
comes from her and not others: it is incomparable." Tony Towle's most recent
book is The History of the Invitation: New & Selected Poems 1963-2000
(Hanging Loose Press, 2001). His work displays "elegance of style, lush
imagery, lofty diction, transparent use of metaphor, and numerous devices of
wit and rhetoric," writes Charles North. Mr. Towle was the editor of The
Poetry Project Newsletter from 1987-1990.

*  *  *

Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and

WHAT IT IS about the crayfish, now an epiphany, I am on my way to Miami,
she is again on the top of the rock in the aquarium: it is not that she

found NUMEROUS WAYS there, learning how to CLIMB: it is an entire STYLE or
MODE OF BEING she has absorbed: likewise for CLIMBING DOWN: all those
early trials and errors, those falls: all those half-hearted leaps: now
she RUNS THE GAMUT with ease: this is already a second-order learning: see
Bateson: a meta-learning: LEARNING HOW: likewise for her AQUARIUM ROUTING:
not one MAP but NUMEROUS: not SCENT or LANDMARK but whole INTERNALS: with
her enormous claws it would be easy for her to tangle with the plants but
she has learned HOW TO UNTANGLE: it has NOT BEEN EASY FOR HER, but her

8:00 p.m., featuring the work of three emerging artists, Daniel Anizon,

Please come if you can.

Hi Rachel,
Thanks for your reply.
I confirmed yesterday my reservation for the 25th of April. I will fly with
Swissair, arriving at JFK around 15 PM. I will leave on May 2nd.
If you are not at home, I may wait somewhere if it is to complicate to
arrange for key or something.
I have'nt got a single invitation for the opening on Friday 27th, but of
course you are on the list I gave to June Bateman, so you should receive one
soon. By the way, I think I lost track of Molly Thompson, have you heard of
her?
All I know is that opening is at 6PM, 211 West Broadway, at the Watermoon
gallery (see www.junebateman.com website for details and pictures of the
show). But you did not say if you saw June and if you are going to
participate to my show ?
See you soon.
Daniel

>
> On the final day (11 February 2001) of the William

> London, 30 people gathered on the steps outside to
> reclaim Blake from 'the dead hand of capital, empire

>
> People dressed up as angels, tigers, chimney sweeps

>
> The action at the Tate happened the day before a march

>
> The action got a very good response from visitors to

>
> The origins of the ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING SERIES are shrouded in

>
> According to the latter, Chaos gave rise to five elements: Gaea, Tartarus=
,
> Erebus, Eros and Night. Gaea & Ouranos had children whom Ouranos treated

h

> and formed the Curators. They had a dog's head and bat's wings and were t=
he

> failed to edit their work.
>
> Another drop fell onto an island of earthly paradise in the Hudson River
> delta, creating music & poetry from which was born the goddess Zincodite.
> For Millennia, the month of May has been reserved for celebrations of
> Zincodite's generosity & keen ear. The practice of sacrificing goats &

Arielle. Charles Bernstein is a major literary thinker and poet. I have
quite a few of his books. Obviously he's in a slightly ambiguous position
because he's the director of the List. But from his own poetic (see eg the
essays in the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E mags or books): he is or has always been very
aware of the intersection of poetics and political thinking and or action.
No one should want to "flame" you for your dislike of politics...we all get
tiredof it. Probably Karl Marx got sick of it (his wife must have). But
humour aside: the relation is complex. Your friend who accused you of being
insulated etc in academia was being pretty unfair and also rather
simplistic.Academia is part of the real world (unless your Bishoop Berkley
or someone)...dont take that stupid reverse snobbery.Pratt should have been
more gracious. Be proud of being educated and earning a good wage. I would.
If I was suitably qualified I take a big salary: then I'd worry about
politics, or I might just say :to hell with it all! Its impossible to be
endlessly obsessed with the "wrongs of the world" in a kind of evangelical
world and do good creative work.(Politicos become boring fanatics if they're
not careful).  Conversely it can be argued that there is always a political
content in any art. But the link may be subtle. Nor is it imperative that a
writer or artist be "for the people" or left wing. But I think its good and
healthy that we dont lose sight of the "real world"...but that real world is
also at a university. I've worked at all sorts of occupations from labourer
and factory worker to an engineering techniction, ok that's coloured my view
of things, and maybe can be sensed in my own poetry. But its rarely the
case: sure such experience does "inform" what I do, but also does the degree
in English I did and the quite wide reading. I'm reading "Middlemarch" at
present. That's a magnificent novel: one could learn a lot about life,
politics,art the whoe gamut from that book. I just watched the video of
"Gladiator"..ok..so so. On the news every night is some new scandal, some
political or human tragedy: I simply dont care. Life is too short: I go for
a walk, read, eat, look at flowers. I enjoy life. I'm not going to be "bowed
down" with the woes of the world. That's the Guilt, or Justice Trap: the
reality is that "justice " per se is a myth. The world can be improved in
small ways by an individual...but you or I are just as good if we write
obscure poems and hopefully beautiful poems and enjoy life while we have it.
 Of course I support political action like the strike in Hawai but its not a
big deal for me. Alan Sondheim's work is worth a look at.It seems to me that
its at least cathartic for Alan: but I hope neither he nor any other poet
are deluded that poetry or art will ever have any imapact on the "realities"
of the world, whatever they are, or were.
 But whatever: one thing is essential: openness. If people are scared to
express their opinions, of whatever kind, then we are certainly heading into
the darkness.
  A la Creeley we might heve to get a big car, for chrissakes, and burn our
way in or through it and to hell with it all! Regards, Richard Taylor.

So:    If you see a tarpit,
         you'd jolly well better scarpit!

         Ancient English riddle.

Jonathan, Thanks for doing this letter to Asian American Studies Center at
UCLA-- the idea of a Ben Cayetano chair is such an obscenity it makes me
want to weep here in the crazed theory forests of UC Santa Cruz.  Was
Russell Leong aware of this Cayetano deification at such a moment?  I
realize the Pacific Rim players have little or no idea what is going on in
peripheral sites of the interior Pacific, but this one breaks all records
for blind sublimation to an anti-education governor who stands for
reactionary forces of downsizing, union-breaking and utter dermoralization
of teachers high and low.  Please add my name to your list of protesters,
Rob Wilson Professor of transnational/postcolonial literatures, Oakes
College, UC Santa Cruz

thank you jerrold. this is terrible news. du bouchet is less well-known
than yves bonnefoy or jacques dupin. he has been horribly under-served in
english translation: only paul auster and david mus have translated books
or book-length selections. paul celan translated du bouchet into german.
the notion of an "abstract french lyric" fails miserably when applied to
du bouchet; like celan he lives and breathes. below is a rough
translation of the obit from le monde, to be followed shortly by some
poems....tom orange / wdc

-----------------
The poet Andre du Bouchet died, Thursday April 19, in Truinas at the Drome
where he resided, at the age of 77, following a serious illness diagnosed
two years ago.

With Andre du Bouchet, one of contemporary French poetry's highest and
purest voices dies out -- a voice that knew to guard itself against two
great temptations: the excess of lyricism, overflow of ego -- "loss of
oneself refreshes," he wrote --, and the escape into an abstraction in
which the world itself would no longer be the horizon. Considered
difficult, his poetry however became, when du Bouchet read it himself in
public or in front of a computer, so limpid, obvious, admirably
structured.  Inheritor of Mallarme and especially his great master Pierre
Reverdy, du Bouchet had kept intact the idea of a poetry that should
accept no compromise, no concession.  "The words of the tribe" could not
enter the poem.

Anecdote, biography or mundanity in fact find no place in his oeuvre. From
the start, around the end of 1940, his choices were made; certain discrete
standards would go together with a rigorous poetic esthetics. Relatively
prolific -- about thirty books and a number of limited editions -- the
oeuvre has no room for explication, no space of expression for the
personality, the thoughts or opinions of the poet.

Andre du Bouchet was born May 7, 1924 in Paris.  His paternal French
family emigrated to the United States in the 18th Century. His origins on
the maternal side are Russian and Jewish. The war interrupted his Parisian
adolescence, and from 1941 to 1948 he found himself exiled in the United
States. He completed his studies at Harvard and started to teach English.
Upon returning, he rediscovered the French language, the use of which he
claimed to have lost. During a conversation that he granted to us in
October 2000, he spoke at length about this central experience of his
life. This rupture probably gave his poetic language this original
character, as if released from a coating, as well as the by no means
peripheral relationship that Bouchet maintained with the translation of
writers such as Mandelstam, Pasternak, Celan, Holderlin, but also
Faulkner, Joyce -- a portion of Finnegans Wake (Gallimard, 1962)  -- , and
Shakespeare.

All these works are tied by a common thread. It would be unjust, and it
could be, to reproach him for his theory of the translation. He did not
explicitly have one. It was less one of the movement of appropriation or
collecting than of the extension of the field of the word, at the interior
of which whose each work leaves a mark.

du Bouchet's first book, Air, was published in 1951. But the collection
that truly inaugurates the oeuvre is Dans la chaleur vacante [tr. by David
Mus as Where Heat Looms, Sun and Moon 1995], which appears ten years
later. From this point the work develops by sharpening each one of its
edges, by revealing its escarpments and its accidents. "At the tearing in
the sky, the thickness of the ground" du Bouchet writes on the first
page. Mountain, glacier, reliefs. . . all the world's mineral and physical
reality is convened. There is nothing under the heading of decoration.
"One cannot make a higher bid on reality," he says again in one of the
pages of his "notebooks."  If the "I" is expressed, it does not drop to
any confidence.

From Ou le soleil (1968) to Axiale (1992), through Laisses (1979),
L'Incoherence (1979) or Desaccordee comme par la neige (1989), the subject
matter does not vary. There are no other matters to speak about properly
but the drawing of the word, the space of its deployment, its movement and
its projection into terrain at once tangible and mysterious. The poem is
detached on the page in vocables separated by white spaces, many, intended
to make the poet's gaze at once participate with the reader's listening.
Prose or poetry?  The question does not find an answer immediate. But it
hardly worries the interested party. . .

The dialogue with painters --  there still without giving in to
speculation, criticism, specialized or in-the-know discussion -- proves
quite as central as that with the foreign works. Tal-Coat and Giacometti
are the two great witnesses, but also Genevieve Asse, Bram van Velde. . .
not to mention the great past masters, Poussin, Hercules Seghers. . . It
is finally necessary to cite the experience of collective work around the
Maeght gallery and the journal L'Ephemre (twenty issues from 1967 to
1972), alongside Jacques Dupin, Yves Bonnefoy, Louis-Rene des Forets, then
Paul Celan.

"The word is there / Not me." This abstention for du Bouchet was in no way
the expression of a will to withdrawal. His cordial and demanding
presence, his attention, the constant search of a "truth of word" --  to
borrow a title from Yves Bonnefoy -- showed. "All that is far today,
undoubtedly the turning emerged too late." (Osip Mandelstam, Journey in
Armenia, translated by du Bouchet).

The essence of the work is published by Mercure de France and at
Fata Morgana. Two volumes appeared in the "Poesie-Gallimard" collection.

Dear Friends:

Do you have a bunch of old promotional cd-roms lying around? Old
shareware disks that won't run on your new computer? Operating
systems that wont cut it any longer?

Perhaps some old music cd's? Maybe something your mother-in law gave
you for your birthday, or some Milli Vanilli?

I'm using recovered cd's and cd-roms to shingle my little house in
historic St. Boniface, Manitoba. If you want your refuse to be
immortalized forever, (and help me protect my house from the savage
Canadian climate) please send your old cd's to:

Lumpy
223 Bertrand Street
Winnipeg, Manitoba R2H 0N5

     Introduction by Kristen Gallagher
     Interview: Gil Ott with Kristen Gallagher, Kerry Sherin, & Heather=
 Starr
     Interview: Gil Ott with Kristen Gallagher

     "One thing Gil sys he has often reacted against is the assumption that=
=20
'people seek out order'  . . . Perhaps much of Gil's work gets its=20

certain pleasure he refers to as 'the satisfaction of articulation' =97 a=20
presence of hearing and saying, of finding relation through more relation.

2. Traffic  (complete)
     by Gil Ott
     96 pages
     ISBN 0-925904-31-7
     $14
     published by Chax Press

     "'The book is looking forward with empty hands, toward you.' So: a=20
sort of gesture, perhaps a sort of supplication. What is being asked? Only=
=20
that you enter 'the place in between, where poetry occurs.' As an architect=
=20
of the gap, Gil Ott provides many doors whereby this place may be entered=20
and whereby you may encounter and be part of the 'traffic' of that=20
occurence. It's not a house of many mansions, but it is a poetry, a place=20
which may not take place unless you enter. So: a different sort of gesture,=
=20
one of welcome invitation. Think it over. What have other hands offered you=
=20
lately?"
                        =97 John Taggart


from TRAFFIC

                                        portrait
        of a political extremist, showing
        a note in his own hand

        trained viewers to come, who will demand

        you, lover, the disproven equation.



an art, or living exponent, reducing desire to "I want myself."
Hunger, on the othe rhand, in habits, sends its nakedness out. The
distance between us collapses.

Arielle:

I agree that there is a place for overtly political material in poetry and
in fact, language being innately political, there is no poetry that is not,
intentionally or otherwise, political in some way.

My view in the great "tar pits" debate was that the Hawaii posts were
outside the parameters of the list because they did not directly involve the
creating/presenting/appreciating of poetry but rather the political
struggles of those whose work it is to teach the practice and appreciation
of poetry.  Not to say that isn't extremely important and relevant, I only
thought it was a step outside the realm of the list but, as the moderators
made clear, I was off base.

I didn't have any problem with the anti-Bush anthology posts because 1) I
think it's a great idea and 2) even if it was a pro-Bush poetry anthology
(as if such a thing could happen!) I'd have been okay with it because it was
directly related to the creation and presentation of poetry.

Best,

Steve

Hi Susan:

Sorry if my 2nding the tarpits of poetry post came across as anti-professor=

certainly wasn't my intention.  And, yes, the delete key works fine.  I
should have looked at the list guidelines before leaping into the fray.

My work for money is completely unrelated to my work for the love of it, an=
d
I guess I projected that fractured world view outward, expecting you all,
whose work for money and work for the love of it is intimately linked, to
have as disjointed a view of work as my own.

Anyhow, good luck with the struggle and post away.  I'll let the moderators
moderate from now on.

The University of Wisconsin Press has just announced a new book series on
contemporary North American Poetry. I am very happy and pleased to be on the
Advisory Board among a great crew of hands on deck, and I am sure one of the
three distinguished general editors (Lynn Keller at Wisconsin-Madison, Alan
Golding at University of Louisville, and Adalaide Morris at University of
Iowa) will be able to post the whole brochure to the Poetics List. I just
wanted to make an early alert to everyone who might be interested. All best,
Rachel Blau DuPlessis

tho i've been virtually a lurker lately i want to add my $0.02 here.  i
feel the hawai'i posts were entirely legitimate.  if we are restricted to a
narrow definition of "poetics," we would never have learned of ramez
qureshi's death, for example, which for me at least was one of the list's
shining moments.  i consider community-building to be a prime function of
the list, and human emergencies count.

Not surprised to read that a fourth grade class is more on-the-ball than
the shrieking heads who populate our television news-talk shows -- Having
wearied of the oft-repeated invitation to postmodernists to step outside
their upper floor office windows to test the cutltural construction of
gravity, I do hereby invite all those within the Bush administration who
have been daily reminding us that we breathe out carbon dioxide every
minute of the day to step inside an airtight booth which shall then be
filled with the exhalations of poets.

Thayler's first full length perfect bound book since 1972 is now
available.

                 More personal and local than the epic sprawl of his
recent Poems From
                 Naltsus Bichidin, Carl Thayler's Shake Hands goes after
readers with a
                 frequently agonized, always lively honesty. Barrooms,
love affairs,
                 roadside ephemera, bankrupt religion, a western sky
under which
                 recognizing one's inevitable loneliness becomes the
only possible way to
                 reach out to others; all these things swarm up at
readers like barely
                 comprehensible dangers lurching into one's headlights
on an all night
                 drive to nowhere in particular. One feels in these
poems both Thayler's
                 fear of writing them and his need to do so. These are
not the comments
                 of a smug cultural observer. Instead, Shake Hands reads
like the
                 knotted midnight confessions of the writer for whom
only poems can
                 manage to say what would otherwise never get said.

                 --Mark Wallace


                 "Consider the sun falling in Illinois / then before you
can retain a
                 breath / there's Indiana..." strikes me as the best
serial staging
                 of cultural geography I've seen since Burma Shave
signs.

                 --Tom Clark


                 Carl Thayler has been one of the hidden masters of
American poetry for
                 nearly forty years. His language is as sharp as a
skinner's knife, and
                 reveals exactly what's beneath the skin - far more
complex and
                 beautiful than any micro-chip orchestra or the
unblinking innards of a
                 Rolex. We get one world per customer. Here's Carl's -
cognoscenti will
                 recognize J. Dean, D. Varsi of Peyton Place, the cream
of country
                 singers and fast drivers, old poets, good women, and
gnarly codgers
                 encountered between now and LA fifty years ago.

                 --Howard McCord


                 Fierce and unflinching, Carl Thayler makes poems that
are vulnerable
                 nonetheless in their feeling search for truth. That
there be an
                 achieved  knowledge of truth in an unredeemed world-as
the poet calls
                 it-is remarkable enough, but the music lifts also with
sudden strikes of
                 ecstatic clarity. Like Hank Williams or Lefty Frizzell,
he follows the
                 unpredictable and at times predacious wanderings of the
heart. The
                 result-a lyric dignity very hard to locate these days
of shallow,
                 post-modern irony-love.

                 --Dale Smith

From Shake Hands

4.

When my wife and I visited
the Vomitologist our daughter
had just tossed the remains of supper,
favoring the etiquette of dread

to sharing our table.
Her body he said was a complicated system
of fantasy.  We couldn’t
swallow that.  Our daughter

needed to maintain a safe distance
from our groceries, from me
tho only her barely concealed smile
revealed that.  Your daughter

has no appetite
for authority, as long as she
doesn’t eat she avoids
indenture.  It was bleak,

our retreat, and the gross impingements
of Providence.  The girl, while lacking
a specialist’s purview, rejected
our table nonetheless and furthermore

her body was no indigestible trope.
She stroked her throat.  She measured
the joke to the nearest ounce.
O the welcome mat was set

between salad greens and
the assembled Shades.  Perhaps beyond
our old linoleum
she might capitulate to Sara Lee.

But who could see beyond
the mists, in transit, drawn
together over rough terrain.  Obviously
we hadn’t encountered

an epicurean. I’d go so far
as to declare her mom and I
—to leave, a moment, the specialist’s modality—
had been royally fucked

by the gyro effect
of the ameliorating finger.
So much for documentation.
So much for annotated

debris.  The dark edges
of our daughter’s body
cold sacerdotal gravy.


The pre-pub cost is $10 including postage from us directly.

Be well

Steve--not to worry; I believe in saying what you mean, and that's what you
meant....our strikes are now over, praise be.  One reason I wrote to the
list is because Hawai`i gets so little attention in the national media that
I feel I need to do some personal hyperventilations on issues that are
important to us.  And I do wish our work were more for love--so much
bickering in the academy!  But yes, I do very much enjoy sharing poetry with
my students; they, at least, often have minds that are still open.

Anyway, thanks for writing.

aloha, Susan

Hi Susan:

Sorry if my 2nding the tarpits of poetry post came across as anti-professor,
certainly wasn't my intention.  And, yes, the delete key works fine.  I
should have looked at the list guidelines before leaping into the fray.

My work for money is completely unrelated to my work for the love of it, and
I guess I projected that fractured world view outward, expecting you all,
whose work for money and work for the love of it is intimately linked, to
have as disjointed a view of work as my own.

Anyhow, good luck with the struggle and post away.  I'll let the moderators
moderate from now on.

Steve

editing or culling into the texts i wrote - first assembled into files -
then placed into directories on the homepages and cdroms - but first - to
eliminate awkward or repetitive work - work which is theoretically or
stylistically weak - work which is an embarrassment - written under less
than perfect circumstances - work which should never have been distributed
- last night in fact - cutting out a number of pieces - pruning the cur-
rent file and thinking - this is a form of evanescence - that word remains
with me - it seemed resonant to everything i've been doing - holding back
a little less - releasing the text into noise or the possibility of other
writes and rewrites - as if thought were temporarily concretized, only to
disappear - i'm beginning to think that memory itself is emptied - always
already emptied as they said - referencing null - just as time shudders or
ripples in forgotten corners of the universe - culled work which emerges
elsewhere - a glistening or memory tending to coat alterity - interpenet-
rate alterity - viral formulations almost ghostlike in appearance and
quality - you can't find the source again or at this point if ever -
they've been taken away - as if they themselves weren't present already
incipient in other works that still remain - the gaps closed - they're
sutured over - you don't know i've ever been here - but i have - in spirit
- editing or culling into the texts i wrote -

Don't forget Cid Corman translated Andre du Bouchet -

"Today It's," Origin Press, 1985.

There's also some Bouchet in his GIST OF ORIGIN anthology, a pretty generous
chunk of work - Corman's translation.

i'm not so concerned anymore with "academic" or
"anti-academic" - can't we put that tired
shibboleth to rest? only the failures of poets to
connect what they are doing and saying into a
wider frame of reference - for politics and
poetry to feed into the reservoir of the other

Yeats did this - so did Ginsberg - so does Bly -
even Pound in his own misguided way

it's the often arrogant assumption that the
concerns of the academy are ipso facto those of
poetics or poetry - as though a teachers strike
in Hawaii - whatever it's reasons - must be of
concern to poets everywhere

poets themselves lack a constituency and are not
a "special interest group" - there is no
geopolitical voting block - no union - if there
was i would not join it - and if i did - what
would we do? go on strike? demand better working
conditions for poets everywhere?

i think the notion is ludicrous

forgive me - but i have a hard time feeling a
great deal of compassion for those who are in
arguably "better" living conditions than my own -
perhaps i should be - so the question is - why
aren't i? why do i find it hard to distinguish
the exploitation of labour by management and the
exploit of management by labour? welcome to the
age of the victim - if people are so certain they
are somehow deserving of better - why do they
find it so difficult to find those who will give
it to them? the question is not facitious, but
perhaps a result of reading too much Nietzche

perhaps i too am a hypocrite - i am a "sucker for
the sublime" - one who seeks poetry for its
beauty and its truth, scarcely the most
fashionable of notions these days - clearly a
poet like Blake had great concerns of political,
social and spiritual nature - but he took those
beyond his immediate frame and made them great -
even prophetic

who among us does this? of course - the situation
is always so close to us we cannot see it - i
suspect it will take two generations to recognise
such a person among our generation - and the same
can be said of our political views as well

this is why i call it the tarpits - as a
"dinosaur" (just a youngin' one tho) - it is
difficult not to get trapped in the great, black
undifferentiated mass of "postmodernism" (that
even leads me to use quotes around the word
itself - to maintain the ironic state) as surely
as the Beats felt trapped in the Square - things
aren't square anymore - just flat flat flat

Looking for a book of poems written in 7 languages
to read aloud & impress your unintelligent avant garde friends?
Then you need:

Chac Prostibulario
by Ivan Argüelles & John M. Bennett
96 pages
ISBN 1-886350-53-1
Outrageous 4-color cover, 8 by 9, hefty multi-lingual edition.


Harold Norse states Arguelles is "the most outstanding poet since Pound
for intellect," and when mixed with Bennett's pallet for sound, this
collaboration written in five languages, fires up a new realm of
concentrated stutterance for poetry. A Shakespearean punnery of
language.


CHAC POSTIBULARIO ist ein ootwageous cuncocktioun ov linguadge in un
estado ov tootal dis-schewelmento y abandonmento, un bytte loik der
grayte Saynt John Lennon's immurtal "A Spaniard in the Works," et aussi

Just wondering, as I plan to go to Amherst (Mass, not NY) this weekend -- who among

I'm looking forward to it.

Miles Champion.  An unfussy format, full of work: this issue has Bruce
Andrews, Abigail Child, Alan Davies, Jean Day, Lynne Dreyer, Heather Fuller,

Stephen Dunn, the latest pulitzer poet, is the subject of a long interview
in today's Philadelphia Inquirer,

http://inq.philly.com/content/inquirer/2001/04/29/arts_and_entertainment/DUN
N29.htm

where, towards the end, you will find the following:

His work falls outside two controversial camps in today's poetry: "New
Formalism" and "Language Poetry."

"New Formalism," he says, "arises out of an interesting complaint that free
verse has gotten slack and sloppy. I would agree with that. My way of
remedying it would be to write free verse that is not slack and sloppy,
rather than to return to meter."

Language poetry, he comments, "is a wholly different thing." Its often
"indecipherable" quality annoys him.

"It turns its back on the world of meaning and value," he asserts, conceding
some exceptions. "Finally one word is as good as another word. It absolutely
eliminates the possibility of serious criticism - you can't say anything
because it's more committed to the flow of language on a page than to
linking language with meaning.

"Because it's a poetry of mind that eschews emotion," he continues, "you
have to have a very good mind to do it." Dunn dislikes language poetry's
refusal to "commit itself to things," and its belief in "the indeterminacy
of language."

"Of course," he adds genially of language poets, "they would say that I'm
bourgeois and conservative."

I'd like to recommend a poet, Jessica Freeman, to anyone who might be
interested in getting to know her work.  She was recently brought to my
attention by Bruce Andrews, to whom I'm very grateful for the introduction
to her poetry.  When I was in New York recently, visiting from New Orleans,
Bruce placed her _Bode Well, Cher!_ in my hands -- to my surprise, since
I'd never heard of this fellow Louisiana poet.  Funny how you think you
know the scene where you live pretty well, but then suddenly your picture
is altered.  Jessica has lived in Louisiana for many years, and has been
quietly publishing poetry collections through small presses & magazines.
Until recently, most of the poets in this region weren't even aware of her
presence among us.

I've visited this remarkable poet several times in Baton Rouge and am
gratified to have found her & her work.  Her poetry is edgy, jaggedy &
high-energy.  I just wanted to share a couple of titles for anyone who
might be interested.  You can sample her poetry at the websites listed
below.

Here are the collections that I'm aware of.

_New Orleans Dizzy Spit_ (Oysterville, WA: Anabasis Press, 2000)

_Bolt Bleu_ (Oysterville, WA: Anabasis Press, 1995)
Includes photographs by Thomas Lowe Taylor and an afterword by Susan Nash
Smith entitled "The Dismemberment of Perception: Jessica Freeman's Interior
Languages, Exterior Gaze."

_Bode Well, Cher!_
Published as a supplement to the 1993 issue of _Onionhead_, a now-defunct
magazine published in Florida.  If anyone knows how I can get this book,
even photocopied, please let me know ... since it's technically a
periodical, I can't even get it on interlibrary loan.  Jessica doesn't have
any copies.

Some of her work can be accessed at the following websites:

http://www.burningpress.org/va/anaba/anaba01.html#fre/van
http://www.burningpress.org/va/anaba/anaba03.html#fre/hed

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/juxta/juxta06.html
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/juxta/juxta08.html

I believe her work is also in _Lower Limit Speech: A Newsletter in Poetics_
(#8, 1993)

Yet another report from the Observer of information for which you will
search the American media in vain. Against my normally sunny disposition, I

THE OBSERVER (London) Sunday April 29, 2001

Ed Vulliamy:

Cabal of lawyers drives Bush further to right

George W. Bush's administration - 100 days old today - is being hailed as
his country's most ideologically right-wing of the past 100 years, across
a spectrum of policies ranging from the environment to labour, civil
rights to social issues.

But the rip tide that cuts beneath all Bush's plans to transform the
landscape, with more durable results than any other policy, is the
hijacking - behind closed doors - of the US judiciary.

The administration - to which power was in effect granted by the Supreme
Court in a controversial ruling last December - is preparing not only to
set the highest court in the land on course for a conservative generation,
but has quietly revolutionised the way in which all federal judges are
appointed to benches across the country, guaranteeing politically
right-wing selections.

At the core of this manoeuvre, which will weave a new fabric in US
society, is a tightly organised right-wing lawyers' group which has come
in from the fringes to the core of the administration.

It is called the Federalist Society, of which Bush's Solicitor General
Theodore Olson, Interior Secretary Gale Norton, Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch are leading
members - as are many members of the new White House counsel team.

Stalwart conservative judges on the Supreme Court Anthony Scalia and
Clarence Thomas are patrons and guests of the group, and Attorney General
John Ashcroft is a close affiliate.

The emergence of the Federalists is traced in a study by the New
York-based Institute for Democracy Studies, which concludes that 'extreme
conservative organisations sponsoring a combination of right-wing
litigation and advocacy are opening the way for a radical transformation
of the American legal system'.

Ralph Neas, President of the Washington think-tank People for the American
Way, says that 'the White House counsel's office and the Department of
Justice are being turned over to the Federalist Society, a bastion of
far-right legal thought'.

The Federalist Society's philosophy underpins, and is ready to steer, all
the administration's cornerstone policies on deregulation of environmental
and labour law, education, civil rights and abortion. The author of the
IDS study, Julie Gerchik, says that 'the agenda is to dismantle everything
built since the New Deal'. There was even a Federalist panel in Chicago on
28 March entitled 'Rolling Back the New Deal'.

'Where is the divide between politics and the law here?' says Gerchik.
'This is politics enforced by legal mechanisms.'

The society has already had an impact on major decisions: when Bush pulled
America out of the Kyoto treaty on climate change, he did so after reading
what he called 'important new information'. That information was a report
commissioned by David McIntosh, a Federalist Society founder, arguing that
toxic emissions were exaggerated and warning of costs to business.

But above all, the society has ousted the legal establishment which - in
the form of the profession's traditional representative body, the American
Bar Association - has helped oversee the selection of judges and guarantee
the profession's integrity for five decades.

Since Eisenhower, the ABA has had a semi-official role in advising on
judicial appointments. But in a sudden, little-noticed move last month,
President Bush cut the ABA entirely out of the appointment process. The
Federalists were delighted, having for years targeted the association (in
a special publication, ABA Watch) for such issues as its support for gun
control and opposition to the death penalty.

The ABA's removal creates a vacuum in the recommendation of judges, and
into it has moved a 15-person committee formed between the White House and
Justice Department urgently to seek candidates for some 100 vacancies to
federal benches (one-eighth of all judges).

This recommending committee is firmly in the hands of the Federalist
Society, controlled by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, a society
member, and others. Sources add that some 70 judges have so far been
interviewed, a quarter of them recommended by the Federalist Society.

The society was founded 20 years ago with a mission to beat back what it
saw as a liberal orthodoxy permeating public policy and the courts since
the Civil Rights movement.

Society members propelled the attempted impeachment of President Clinton
over the Lewinsky scandal. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was an active member,
as were many of his team.

Its major benefactor is the Scaife Foundation, controlled by billionaire
conservative magnate Richard Mellon Scaife, who deploys his fortunes to
advance right-wing causes. Among those causes was the 'Arkansas Project',
initiated by Scaife at a cost of $24 million to mount the suit by Paula
Jones - and eventually Lewinsky - against the President.

The first meeting between Scaife and the 'Arkansas Project' was chaired by
Theodore Olson, who steered it and is now Solicitor General of the US, the
country's most influential lawyer, head of the Federalist Society's
Washington chapter, based in the White House.

Olson cut his teeth under Starr in the Reagan administration, and was
counsel to Reagan during the Iran-Contra affair. He was himself
investigated (but not indicted) by a special prosecutor for lying to
Congress, and went on to become chairman of the American Spectator
magazine, which 'broke' the Paula Jones story. His wife Barbara is a pivot
of the Washington right-wing social circuit, herself chairwoman of a
conservative women's organisation funded by Scaife.

>From this background, Olson emerged into the public glare as George Bush's
knight and mouthpiece, triumphantly arguing the President's case against
the Florida recounts in the Supreme Court and ultimately winning him the
election.

The Federalists' other channel to power has been through clerkships at the
Supreme Court under sympathetic judges Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy - and Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.

Many saw Bush's victory as a watershed moment when the judges put politics
above the law. But it is to the future of the court over the next four
years - and thence a generation - that the Federalists are looking.

The backgrounds of the Supreme Court's main conservatives are contentious:
Justice Rehnquist was author of the memo during the historic Brown vs.
Board of Education case in 1952 supporting racial segregation, saying: 'It
is about time the court faced the fact that white people in the South
don't like the coloured people'.

But Rehnquist and the court's other conservatives have always toiled in
counterpoint with liberal appointees and moderate Republicans. However,
only this week, a 5-4 verdict on an apparently innocuous case about
driving licences in Alabama cut a major inroad into the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, ruling that individuals cannot now sue federal agencies over
discrimination cases.

In the hands of Bush's legal team now are two possible appointments during
his term of office which could swing the court decisively to the right.

The Federalists are not the only group taking care to ensure a
conservative federal judiciary. Three right-wing organisations funded by
the Scaife Foundation have organised a series of junkets so that judges
can attend political seminars on the advantages of deregulation in
environment, labour and civil rights law.

They are the Law and Economics Centre, the Liberty Fund and FREE - the
Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, which funded
all-expenses-paid trips, some lasting as long as two weeks, to luxury
venues, featuring golf and horse-riding for the justices.

As well as money from the ubiquitous Scaife family, both the FREE and the
LEC trips for judges are bountifully funded by oil giants Shell and Exxon,
and Philip Morris cigarettes.

Many of the judges who enjoyed them failed - by their own admission - to
disclose these junkets on their annual financial reports, as required by
their own federal ethics laws, according to the Washington-based watchdog
group Community Rights Counsel.

The CRC found that judges' attendance at the junket seminars 'increased
significantly between 1992 and 1998' with a record 88 judges taking trips
in 1998. With 800 active judges at any time, this means that about 10 per
cent of the federal judiciary takes a trip each year.

An exhaustive study by the CRC of seminars and subsequent verdicts by
judges who attended them finds 'doctrinal shifts' and 'considerable
evidence that the education judges receive' has led to 'a strand of
judicial activism that is distinctly pro-market, clearly hostile to
federal environmental regulations and decidedly in keeping with the
curriculum of FREE seminars'.

I'd be very grateful for any information or testimonials concerning the
rumour of the existence of a Raoul Hausmann archive in Rochechouart,
France.  I'm planning a trip there in the next few weeks to pay respects,
and wouldn't mind very much hearing something more, even personal
things, like anecdotes.  The list will love it, too, so send it to them also.

Thanks,

A REMINDER!

UCSD's NEW WRITING SERIES continues it's Spring 2001 schedule with a
reading by Michael Heller on Thursday, May 3, at 4:30pm in the Visual
Arts Performance Space, Russell Lane, UCSD.

The reading is free and open to the public.


                        ***

Author of six volumes of poetry - including, most recently,
_Wordflow: New and Selected Poems_ (Talisman House, 1997) - MICHAEL
HELLER has been called "a latter-day Jewish Yeats" by The East
Hampton Star, "full of terror and joy, trying to make some sense of
the chaotic destructiveness of the 20th century in lyric poetry." His
memoir, _Living Root_, was published by SUNY Press in the Fall of
last year, and his libretto for the opera "Benjamin", based on the
life of the German-Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin, has been set
to music by the composer Ellen Fishman Johnson and performed at the
Philadelphia Fringe Festival. His many awards include prizes from The
New School for Social Research Poetry in Public Places, the New York
State CAPS Fellowship in Poetry, the Alice Fay Di Castagnola Prize of
the Poetry Society of America, a New York Foundation on the Arts
Fellowship and the National Endowment for the Humanities. He has been

   "There is a classic largeness to [Heller's] poems, whether of means or of
   reference--a consummately civilized response to our time that makes
   the intimate and the physical still primary despite the generalizing chaos
   Heller confronts so movingly."

        -Robert Creeley

   "Heller is a serious poet who thinks about his Jewish identity through
   autobiography and poetry.  But he also presents the ultimate conundrum
   of Jewish life after the Shoah: he proves that American English may be
   the major "Jewish" language of the late twentieth century."

I would like to mention that Dunn was a last minute substitution for
someone else at AWP, where, let's see, Bin Ramke on one panel, I was
there, but I'm not published, so I don't count.  Hank Lazar's U. of
Alabama Press was there.  Obviously George Mason.

Dunn is parroting a lot of the things everyone at AWP heard, AWP
"eschewed" by experimental poets.  Mark Jarman, expanding on something like

 > Language poetry, he comments, "is a wholly different thing." Its often
 > "indecipherable" quality annoys him.

said something polemical to the effect that no "real" poetry engaged
literary criticism.  Nods and huzzahs. Dorothy Barrisi, although
apparently in agreement with this, quoted Charles Bernstein.

Not really represented were Columbia, Iowa, Judith E. Johnson apparently
for all the SUNYs.  I might mention that although there was male poetry
war posturing, there were also a lot of women poets who were more
interested in why the available information was so selective, in other
wor(l)ds,

next year, a few months after the MLA, AWP (now "owned" by the MLA?)
will be in New Orleans.  It would be nice to see those of you who do
teach in MFA programs or who have MFAs there, perhaps in a booth a
number of small presses publishing exciting work could share, or in a
panel which will REALLY discuss translation, or at least in a refuses
reading.  Deadline May 30.

Be well,

Two events, you might be interested in.

1) Musical Performance at Cooper Union.
     Kristen Stuart (vocals)
     Chris Stroffolino (keyboards, perhaps mouth kazoo)
     Angus Forbes (drums, of the NYC band Red Soda)
     Sasha Bell (flute, of Ladybug Transistor and Essex Green fame)
     Shawn Vandor (guitar, of recently defunct band "Man & Wife.")

The five of us, at least three who are poets areself, will be loosely
interpreting the little-known rockband the poet Anne Sexton pieced
together
in the late 80s, as part of a larger Anne Sexton forum, tribute
to be held at COOPER UNION (the building with the Starbucks in it,
not the one from which Lincoln spoke) at 7PM on THURSDAY
MAY 17th (Astor Place). For more info, you might want to call the
PSA, I'm told J.D McClatchy and other luminaries will be there--
and maybe they should wear earplugs because the Anne Sexton band
is much more like Patti Smith than I, at least, would have expected---


2) Poetry Reading with
    Chris Stroffolino
    Noelle Kocot
    Droog Ardner

    Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston St.
    (actually I need to check on that) Basement
    Sunday May 20th, 630ish in the evening

For more info, feel free to email me....
