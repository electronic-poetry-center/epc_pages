                             'bridle'


           First off I Trash myself  -  before some Other does
                            the same.
              Regardless of the dark
                it seems the lights keep coming
                                          on and
          On. Lured out, then abandoned into a deadly, sickening animal
                fear.
                           Until there's no skin to speak of

                    Recognition branding pain and frustration
                        with displacement
                        given on a whiplash tongue to a child.
                        The bitter teachings of distance and misappropriation.

                    Re-cognitive maps of will ways despised
                   by those who seek to foster reductive  -

                             person think something
                       "you piece of kit!"
                        that sells their stuff

                           to factor in
                       the morality of exporting
                            what it's all about

                       the public demand (or 'perceived need')
                                    for sacrificial
                         niche identities.

                            A sound of sense coming
                   to be in a world. Were shafts awkwardly
               work at a flickering consciousness in tendered servant
                     hothouses of idling memories
                       curdled by ignorance.

                                -      and lives wiped out
                                       and houses shut up
             without cause      -

                               The plain of knowing
                             being flood.

              Pitching to foil a perk, scribbled with loss.
     And other such dung - holed evasions of purpose. Each market
forbidding engagement. A peak
          to be severed from hope. That chart-topping
                       heartstopping moment. Behind a bleak

             and carping register of modal verbs
          traced against peeping through ever more
                      grotesque zooms. A boggered nostril
               caught in the planed light of beams from painted cradles.

                   Fishing stagnant waters to dish up stagnant melodies.
              And to suppress a rising mange of panic. The respondent

            Planting weary hands in beds of freezing mortar.
                  To reach in a blaze for the parched meal of splinters
               and of back teeth ground beyond dust by impoverished logic.
            Or a metaphoric birth dote racked by incident detours.

But here' the translation that I have:

Release me from my cruel anxiety

To Aphordite

Aphordite on your intricate throne, immortal, daughter of Zues, weaver of
plots, I beg you, do not tame me with pain or my heart with anguish

but come here, as once before when I asked you, you heard my words from
afar and listened, and left your father's golden house and came

you yoked your chariot, and lovely swift sparrows brought you, fast
whirling over dark earth from heavan through the midst of the bright air

and soon arrived. And you, O blessed goddess, smiled with your immortal
face and asked what was wrong with me, and why did I call now,

and what did I most want in my maddened heart to have for myself. 'Whom
now am I to persuade to your love, who Sappho, has done you wrong? For if
she flees, soon she'll pursue you, and if she won't take gifts, soon
she'll give them, and if she won't love, soon she will love you, even if
she doesn't want to.'

Come to me now again, release me from my cruel anxiety, accomplish all
that my heart wants accomplished.  You, join my battle.


                                Sappho

Not knowing how to read Greek how do I know who has the better or more
accurate translation?

Dear Lintz:

I've just read your message and I knew I was getting into trouble when I
started that 1st paragraph but I just let it go. Actually, when I was
writing that, I was thinking of a painting by Goya called *3 May 1808*
and a painting inspired by Goya's, by Manet, called *Execution of
Emperor Maximilian, 1867*. You see I can appreciate what is happening in
these paintings and I am moved by them. But I believe I am moved because of the
person who painted them more than by the historical facts. In the same vein
there have been photographs in the New York Times that blew me away they
were so powerful. It is true the subject matter may have been dramatic,
but the skill and sensitivity that went into them, has much to do with my
reaction. What I am saying, and I would like to pick this up later (I
have to meet someone in 10 minutes) is that politics alone will never
make art even if that is the premise on which it is or was created.
Finally we are left with something more, what I call the residue.

Actually that is more or less the way I feel about art and life. The art
I make, if in fact I make any, is really the left over energy from
living, the residue. What's left at the end of the day. That may seem
terrible to you but it is what I feel in these times.

POETICS READING LIST FOR MARCH 1995

Here's a first attempt at establishing a community reading list resource.
Thanks for the many responses. I will try to post an updated list monthly
and this will depend on your participation. Please feel free to post what
you're reading or what you're currently obsessed with and I will collect
'em as they come in. (Or, if you don't want to junk up the list with info
that will be posted later, email me privately kgolds@panix.com).

--Kenneth Goldsmith

------------------------------


From:    Gary Sullivan <gpsj@PRIMENET.COM>
Subject: Re: Goldsmith's Top 10 request

     1. Aristotle's _On the Art of Poetry_. Section 20, focussing on
linguistic definitions.

     2. Charles Lamb's _Selected Prose_. As Adam Phillips notes in the
Introduction: "[for Lamb] great art was unfinished in the sense that it
relied on the imaginative involvement of the audience to complete it. It
was not something that by virtue of its perfection diminished its
audience. It was not an idol but an invitation." From Lamb's essay on
Hogarth: "*imaginary work*, where the spectator must meet the artist in
his conceptions half way; and it is peculiar to the confidence of high
genius alone to trust so much to spectators or readers." (cf.
"reader-response writing.")
     Lamb's essay "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare" is the first instance
of someone suggesting a preference for *reading* Shakespeare over viewing
the plays performed. An excellent, intelligently stated argument, with all
the panache (& thrice the wit) of Grenier's "I HATE SPEECH." (You'll have
to read Lamb's essay to see whether or not you agree--and to what
extent--Lamb's & Grenier's concerns are related.)

     3. Gertrude Stein. No need to explicate. Richard Bridgman's _Gertrude
Stein in Pieces_ includes a (complete?) bibliography, with actual &
well-guestimated dates for each work, if you want to read her
chronologically.

     4. Samuel Beckett, esp. _How It Is_, _Stories and Texts for Nothing_,
_Fizzles_, _Ill Seen Ill Said_, _Worstward Ho_, _More Pricks than Kicks_,
_Company_ and _Stirring Still_. A big influence on Coolidge, who seems a
big influence on lang pos.

     5. Jack Spicer, _Language_. (cf. Silliman on this in _New Sentence_.)

     6. Clark Coolidge, esp. _Space_, from 1970. The spine of this book
claims it was published by "Harper & Row"; I think they did that with
mirrors.

     7. J.G. Ballard, _The Atrocity Exhibition_. Originally published in
1972 by Panther; reissued (expanded edition?) recently by Re/Search. His
notorious "Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan" (there's an Andrews title for
you) orig. appeared in 1968 in _Ronald Reagan, The Magazine of Poetry_,
edited by John Sladek and Pamela Zoline. (Includes groovy, Brainardesque
line-drawings by Zoline.) Andrews is funnier, but Ballard stays with you
longer. (Well, okay, "has stayed with *me* longer.")

     8. Ad Reinhardt. It's been too long since I've read him to explicate,
but I remember, first coming across journals like _Ottotole_ and _Poetics
Journal_, that the Ad-man'd covered some of that conceptual ground with
respect to the visual arts. His art-world satire collages (including a
horse-racing form with the names of various abstract expressionists
substituted for horses) are not to be missed. He may or may not prove
relevant.

     9. The Firesign Theater, _Don't Crush that Dwarf, Hand Me the
Pliers_. If anything can be said to've prepared me to read (& appreciate)
Bernstein, it was this record. I'm constantly amazed by the lack of
(serious) critical attention these guys have received. One of the members,
David Ossman, did the interviews of New American Poets published in _The
Sullen Art_. (Corinth published that, I think.) There are several e-space
"whatchyoucallems" devoted to the F.T. I've discovered using Gopher.
Can't remember where they are, how I got there. At least one site
includes the F.T. "lexicon," which might be valuable for the un- or
recently initiated.

     10. Alan Davies, "Peer Pleasure," just published in _Cyanosis_ #2
(e-mail cyanosis@slip.net for info). Any serious study of a movement, group,
clique or tendency might include a well-stated, serious critique. "Peer
Pleasure" is an example.

Rather than just list what I've been reading lately (which consists of
relatively little beyond  recent books in the mail, such as Spencer
Selby's, Snow Crash by Neil Stephanson and Watten's Under Erasure [which
I read and reread the way Libyans read Khadafi's Little Green Book], then
massive numbers of Information Week, CIO, PC Week, Byte and the like for
work), I've been mulling over, rereading a series of "Lost Classics" that
I wish were still in print. I've gone so far as to think about trying to
package a series for a publisher.

By and large, these are longpoems, mostly from the 1960s, that I think
everybody should have and read because they're so wonderful:

A particular example of this genre would be Robert Kelly's Axon Dendron
Tree (which, with Finding the Measure & 20 Songs will always be the key
Kelly books for me because they arrived at just the right time to help me
with my own development as a poet, so that I have that deep love for them
that goes beyond articulation). Another is Ron Johnson's two Norton
books, Book of the Green Man and Valley of the Many Colored Grasses.
Another is Frank Stanford's battlefield where the moon said i love you
(writing from the job, so may have botched that title some). That may
still exist, tho would be hard to find, as would be the case I should
think with Grenier's Sentences (a "Chinese box" of 500 4x6 cards, the
sort of impossible project that extends Jonathon Brannen's insights sort
of toward a limit), a collection that I think all 1,000 subscribers to
the T-AMLIT list should read. Not to mention everybody here.

I think somebody could make the argument that the ideas in my own The
Alphabet are a direct (if transformed) descendant of the conception of
form implicit in Axon Dendron Tree and it still reads wonderfully today.

Anyhow, this after that's what seems powerful & moving and worth
mentioning

the now sadly defunkt "Opera Fanatic" show on WKCR, 89.9 NYC, for 4 hours

Subject: More Sixties Gold

Thinking further of great books from the 1950s and '60s that definitely
deserve to be preserved and put forward.

When the Sun Tries to Go On by Kenneth Koch. This 113 page poem is one
of the founding documents of the New York School. It was published in a
little magazine called Hasty Papers and then released as a book by Black
Sparrow in 1969 with a cover and 5 collages by Larry Rivers in an
edition of 1500. It's never been republished and Koch chose not to
excerpt from the poem in his Selected Poems in hopes of eventually
having the whole again in print. It's the most spontaneous and surreal
work of Koch's.

Poem of the Cid, translated by Paul Blackburn. The goofiest publication
of a major poem during that entire decade and maybe ever this appeared
as a "Study Master Publication" in 1966, a competitor with Cliff Notes.
It's an infinitely better poem in English than the Merwin (as anything
by Blackburn is, even tho I admit that I admire some of Merwin's work.
This was the source for Dorn's Gunslinger epic. 151 pages sans Spanish
in the original.

Others that come to mind include John Weiners' Hotel Wently Poems (the
impact of that book, with the Robert LaVigne illustrations, gets lost in
a larger gathering, as does Spicer s Language, for example; my copy of
the Weiners originally belonged to Bill Bathurst during his heavy
recreational pharmaceuticals period, bleary pen doodles everywhere;
Keith Abbott tells me he s cleaned his act up and is now serving as a
consultant to one of the  post-communist  countries in Eastern Europe),
Joanne Kyger s The Tapestry and the Web, Phil Whalen's On Bear's Head
(Norman Fischer is working on this as we speak), Kathleen Fraser's What
I Want, Curtis Faville's Stanzas for an Evening Out, and possibly Tom
Clark's Neil Young. There are some critical texts that also would
warrant rescuing: David Ossman's The Sullen Art, the original
Olson/Creeley Mayan Letters.

Subject: Re: Bedside Books

Books I'm either reading or about to that I forgot because I was
scribbling my email at work (avoiding the completion of a white paper on
"What is PC Asset Management?"):

Culture on the Brink: Ideologies of Technology, edited by Gretchen
Bender & Timothy Druckrey (Bay Press' DIA series), with pieces by
Stanley Aronowitz, Paula Treichler (Cary Nelson's SO) on AIDS and
Identity, Langdon Winner, Laurie Anderson, Avital Ronell, and Andrew
Ross. Anderson is the only one I didn't actively solicit for work when I
edited Socialist Review. These other folks are all terrific, but I will
be very curious to see if they actually understand what they're talking
about in this terrain. If I had a dime for every bad piece of writing on
technology meets culture, I'd never work again.

New Left Review 209 (Jameson on Derrida & Marx, Stuart Hall on Carribean
identity, Geras on Rorty, some other excellent looking pieces [meaning I
haven't read them yet]). Looks like the best issue of NLR in about 5
years.

Made to Seem, Rae Armantrout's new book from Sun & Moon. This is
rereading really, since I see most of these poems in manuscript first
(often in ten or twelve different versions with just one word or a line
break altered). Seeing them in a book is always a curious experience for
me since it means that they have now been "pinned down" in a way they
seldom seem to be "in life." Here's my favorite this week:

MY PROBLEM

It is my responsibility
to squeeze
the present from the past
by demanding particulars.

When the dog is used
to represent the inner
man, I need to ask,
"What kind of dog is it?"

If a parasitic
metaphor grows all
throughout--good!
Why stop with a barnacle?

A honeysuckle,
thrown like an arm,
around a chain-link fence,
would be far more

articulated,
more precisely repetitive,
giving me the feeling
that I can go on like this

while the woman
at the next table says,
"You smell pretty,"

and sends her small daughter's
laugh, a sputtery orgasm,
into my ear--

though this may not have been
what you intended.

It may not be a problem
when I notice
the way the person shifts.

Rae's poems often have the hallucinated clarity of a dream state (maybe
in this case, with the decidedly incestuous undertone of the mother
initiating the daughter's "orgasm," one of the dwarf dreams out of Twin
Peaks). Behind that lucidity the "narrative frame" is often either
unclear or unimportant compared with the rhetoric or structure of the
argument at the surface (a particularly Lacanian view of content I
suppose). I can't tell if the Bromige allusion in the title is intended
or not.

There's also a lengthy piece on Armantrout (the first that I'm aware of)
by Jeffrey Peterson in the new Sagetrieb. I continue to be amazed that
Rae hasn't been the "crossover" success of LangPo & G1 generally, but
where some fall back on beauty, humor, or anger posed as satire, Rae
never pulls punches in her work. The largest book to date is a selected
published in France in French. Amazing!

Balance Sheet (Roof, 1994) and various books of poems by Emily Dickinson
(I seem to do that periodically). I'm looking at Keith Smith's
Non-Adhesive Binding, which gives fantastic ideas & instruction for real

Wow, which is very silly, but refreshes me on the need to be creative in
managing & directing an organization and the people who work with me
there. I'm also reading manuscripts by Anne Tardos and
typesetting/designing manuscripts/books by Mary Margaret Sloan and Myung

Subject: Groovy Books

An extension of the "Sixties Gold/Classic O.P." discussion:

                          TEN GROOVY BOOKS

     KEY: Groove Factor 1-3 = "Groovy"
          Groove Factor 4-6 = "Very Groovy"
          Groove Factor 7-9 = "Totally Groovy"
          Groove Factor 10 = "Oh My Fucking God That Is Like
                              Totally *Beyond* Groovy"

     Call me a fetishist, but what *I* like are "groovy" books.
     "What the hell does that mean?"
     "By what measure--'grooviness'?"
     "Does the work *in* the book have to be 'good' for a book to be
considered groovy?"
     "Can a 'fine print' edition of something be 'groovy'?"
     Hey, thanks for asking. Well, first of all, *obviously* everyone's
going to have different ideas as to what's "groovy."  For me, "groovy's
measure" is something I feel first in my gut then, later, spend hours on
the phone with friends, "verifying."  I'll describe the book, after which
point I'll ask, "So, is this groovy, or what?" A "yes" answer from more
than 1/2 of all queried friends "verifies" grooviness. Level of
queried-friend enthusiasm determines Groove Factor. A "no" answer from
more than 1/2 can either (a) lower Groove Factor, or (b) annul said book's
"groovy" status. (Book becomes "just-a-book.") No, the work
doesn't *necessarily* have to be any good. But, it helps. Lastly,
"groovy," like "campy," is a value attributed more by audience
member, than maker. Most "fine print" editions--lovely though they
might be--are not "groovy." (It's a distinction that admittedly still
needs work.) (Chris Stroffolino, as someone in academia who's also
interested in contemporary rock music, you might be the perfect person
to--perhaps as a thesis?--hammer out the above admittedly "foggy notion"s
of "grooviness" into a "sharp" essay.)
     So, in no particular order, here are 10 randomly chosen "groovy"
books ...
     Alfred Tennyson, _Lover's Tale_, Walton Press, no copyright date.
This hardcover (library binding?) of Tennyson's poem includes three
"found" photos by Bern Porter. I gave this book 1 Groove Unit for each
photo. Three photos x 1 Groove Unit ea. = GROOVE FACTOR 3.
     Chris Mason, _Click Poems_, Shabby Editions, 1982. "The Click Poems
were inspired by and are dedicated to the click language of the Bushmen in
South Africa, and the Ameslan sign language of the deaf community of the
United States." A beautiful mini-chap w/extraordinary work (can't
reproduce here; poems use "fermatas", illustrations of lips &etc.,
scribbled out text) found used in MPLS. GROOVE FACTOR: 5. Hey, wait! The
address says "c/o Cris Cheek"! And Cris is on this list! I've "talked to"
Cris! GROOVE FACTOR: 7.
     Jack Spicer, _After Lorca_, (picture of cone = press name?), 1974. A
reprint (pirated?). Blue ink. The verso of the title page says: "This book
has been typed on an IBM Selectric blah, blah, blah, by Robin Cones and
printed by Marco Polio for the Government, with a cover from a photo by
blah, blah, blah, in March, 1974." Anyone know who made this book?
Delicious! GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     Patti Smith, _Seventh Heaven_, Telegraph Books, 1972.  Patti's first
book, I think. GREAT cover photo: looks like Patti hasn't bathed since
1966, struggling to keep eyes open.  Dedication: "this book is dedicated
to/ Mickey Spillane/ and/ Anita Pallenberg." How groovy? GROOVE FACTOR 8.
     James Sherry, _In Case_, Sun & Moon Press, 1981. Great lurid pulp
cover, text pages printed on *pulp stock paper*. Jonathan Brannen (a
frequent Groove Consultant) mentioned that he'd seen a review of this book
that actually *criticized* the book for having been printed on such
"cheap" paper. (Critic obviously didn't "get" it.) GROOVE FACTOR
(including Brannen's anecdote):  6.
     Maxine Chernoff, _A Vegetable Emergency_, Beyond Baroque Foundation,
1977. This 8-1/2" x 11" printed on cheap stock was published in an edition
of EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED copies.  *Tell* me that's not groovy. Bonus
Groove Unit as I got it signed by Chernoff in '93, who explained the high
press run: "Yeah, they, um, they printed an awful lot of these." GROOVE
FACTOR: 6.
     James Haining (editor), _Salt Lick_ Vol. 2, Nos. 1-2, 1972.  Every
issue of _Salt Lick_ is groovy, but this one particularly so. Includes
Gerald Burns' _Boccherini's Minuet_ as a make-it- yourself chapbook insert
(!); also includes poems by Robert Slater, Robert Trammell's "George
Washington Trammell," poems by Ann Darr, Stephen Leggett, Bruce Andrews'
"Getting Ready To Be Frightened" ("go Gandhi go"), poems by James Haining,
drawings by Wilton David, and essays & reviews by Burns, Michael Lally, Al
Drake, Andrews, Victor Contoski, Darr, Ron Silliman, Daniel Castelaz, and
Haining. Reading this, you get the sense that, in 1972, anything might've
happened. Incredible list of Books & Mags received. GROOVE FACTOR: 10.
     J H Prynne, _Kitchen Poems_, Grossman/Cape Goliard, 1968.  Top o' the
line poetry, *beautiful* edition (great two-page "trig" drawing in red on
title & facing pages). GROOVE FACTOR 9.  (Docked one point from perfect
score only because I found two copies in the same used bookstore.) (Groove
"aura" loss.)
     Robert Gluck, _Marsha Poems_, Hoddypoll Press, 1973. Instead of
stapling this 8-1/2" x 11", the publisher bound it with red string. Also,
"Marsha"--the cartoon woman on the cover--has red flowers felt-tip penned
onto her dress. GROOVE FACTOR: 5.
     Tom Weatherly, _Maumau American Cantos_, Corinth Books, 1970. The
title? *Way* "seventies." Includes subtitles like: "roi rogers and the
warlocks of space." You know what I'm thinkin'?  I'm thinkin': GROOVE
FACTOR 8.
     That's ten. Groovy.
     Yours,
     Gary

An adage from the sixties: the only way out is through.  Let me suggest some
texts that might be useful as ways to fight back--to critique the academic
folkways that oppress us:

Charles Bernstein, "What's Art Got to Do With It . . ." , etc.

John Dewey, _Art as Experience_

Larry Hickman, _John Dewey's Pragmatic Technology_

Ronald deSouza, _The Rationality of Emotion_

Mark Johnson, _The Body in the Mind_ (for the basic idea, not the
interminable
                                        Kant-quibbling)

Peter Sloterdijk, _Critique of Cynical Reason_

Bruno Latour, _We Have Never Been Modern_

Jacques Derrida, _Specters of Marx_

. . . many of whom, of copurse, contradict one another completerly . . .

(Sorry these are all boys. I wish I had a good explanation for that. I'd add
Donna Haraway to this list except I have some fundamental objections I'm
still
trying to work through.  I doubt it's accidental that my favorite women
writers
are all poets!)

are stacked up, and I'm waiting for the new books by Rae Armentrout
and Carla Harryman (mentioned here w/in the last week; but I'm not
near my booklist and alas can't remember the names) as well as
Jessica Grim's Locale. Also eagerly awaiting the new (18th)
volume in Patrick O'Brian's ongoing series of novels about
his twin characters Aubrey/Maturin and their lives and adventures
in the British navy during the Napoleonic wars. Again, I ccan't
recall the name of this not-yet-here volume.

Dear Lindz:

Sorry about that message earlier today, I spelt your name wrong. I guess I
was rushing off and so went the message. I am trying to remember what I
said to you and I have a feeling my last comment may have been beside the
point.

I think there was *one* point I wanted to make! Of course words are words
and by the way they don't have to be poetry to have meaning. And yes of
course we are all tied to the time in which we live. And it is true that
Western art is not universal, although we have made a pretty good stab at
making American culture universal. One could make a similar case for
the English language but I won't because I know what you mean. And yes,
it would seem that art is not eternal. That was a bad choice of words.

In a world where the transcendental has almost been abandoned, art might be,
for some people, a route of return. It sounds corny I guess, but sometimes
when I see primitive art like those wonderful totem poles in BC or art by the
Shakers, it makes me realize that people made these things with a belief
system in tact. These were not objects as much as they were a physical
manifestation of a belief. Now I am perfectly aware that there is a
strong current out there that says this type of thinking is impossible
today. That if anything, art has been reduced to the fringes of society,
artists are marginalized (so what else is new) and the best one can do is
parody and more specifically parody the media. Nietzsche said as much one
hundred years ago or thereabouts and it looks like his prophecy holds water.

So where does that leave me in terms of a response to you. Only that I am
very much in favour of reality and getting a grip on it. And whether I
like it or not I was born in the twentieth century and am a product of
it. I try to work with what I've got. I try to speak to my time,
otherwise I have nothing to say.

When I think of Lincoln's speech at Gettysburg I think of poetry.
It is extremely powerful today. In the hands of a lesser person the
speech would not have been remembered, as indeed Lincoln believed it
would not. Yes I guess we do remember the men that died on that battlefield
and yes we would know of this battle even if there had been no Gettysburg
Address, but America would be a far poorer nation without those words,
than it is with them. And I would venture to say that for me, not being
an American, the history of the civil war may only be interesting
because of the Gettysburg Address.(And books like Gone With The Wind!)

Best to you.

Blair Seagram, in talking about the possibility or impossibility of art
as a return, perhaps to the transcendental, you referred to a belief many
people hold -- "Now I am perfectly aware that there is a
strong current out there that says this type of thinking is impossible
today. That if anything, art has been reduced to the fringes of society,
artists are marginalized (so what else is new) and the best one can do is
parody and more specifically parody the media. Nietzsche said as much one
hundred years ago or thereabouts and it looks like his prophecy holds water."

While I sometimes find myself working within the trappings of this sort
of thinking, I also wonder what such thoughts have to do with artists
working from and sometimes within such cultures as the Hopi and Zuni, or
hundreds of cultures throughout the world (and by no means are all the
practices of such artists "traditional" in senses understood by their
culture or this generalized Western one) whose practices deserve to be
considered as legitimate or central as any other, including the one in
which we hold ourselves up to Nietzschean prophecies.

I know that nothing you say argues against my thinking on this, but I
just wanted to respond with something of what our cultural limitations
provoke in my own thinking.

Blair,
I was following your discussion with Lindz and was intrigued by
your comments on Lincoln.  Given what you said about the necessity
of his "words", would you go so far as to say that poetry (words)
makes things happen?  This has been on my tongue lately.  Because
if poetry does make things happen, what happens when you write
against poetry, try to resist language?

I also agree with your comments that this is an age abandoning the
transcendental.  But if you write in resistance to language, widening
its holes, flirting with contradictions or the its take upon
"reality", is this not a transcendental pursuit?  Perhaps it's
just mask in place stuff.  (looking forward to your reading
next Wedn. Lindz)

Ryan

     My boat leaves for America tomorrow
     I thrust my tongue out at the waves
     From lips stirring the silent water
     Of my mouth. Great ships drag love-
     Less shadows across the earthly tug

     Of you my love, my earth. I'm lost:
     My heart, mirror of earth, is brok-
     En. I no longer know anything, only
     Love; condemn me to die, for I love
     No one. This day the sun sprawls a-

     Cross the sky, & the streets are a-
     Wash with fresh rain. Slowly I make
     My way, brow clouded with fire, sad
     Since everything is ours loved mad-
     Ly away. & now, my boat floats pale

     In solid space. It passes you by as

     Will announce my arrival in America
     To know & at last be devoured there
     Where I'll live on beneath Hawthorn

     Flowers, lakes & light. Never shall
     I return, but in new clothes wander
     Hat in hand and striding right foot
     First in all directions drag myself
     Beneath the streets beneath earth I

     Once loved. My boat trembles on the
     Horizon, all black, & vanquished by
     The clatter of brick waves, blacker
     Than these hands folded together, O
     Our clustered senses woven in light

  It's great to see the word transcendental pop up again...this time it
  seems people are giving it a little more breathing room...there are these
  half-hearted admissions of eating it on the sly as if it were junk food,
  or worse, health food which is politically irresponsible these days...
  But seriously--I guess I'm thinking about "if we make a revolution make
  it for fun" from D.H.L. and wondering if the infantilization of the tran-
  scendental Derrida flaunted, and the politicization of it Perelman wavers

  "makes new advances" on the transcendental which is probably a style
  before it's anything else...and what of the idea that the transcendental
  is an feeling of scope that includes, potential, all others--that allows
  access to what could defeat it if you couldn't keep up the illusion of
  returning to it, which may be an illusion because of course silly you're
  really there all the time--- etc.........  chris s.

Hi Gary, feeling ravished by your response. Bright sunshine here, buds
opening, a snow-gum eucalyptus swaying in the garden. Fascinating the
gradual process by which the whip of the sapling begins to take the more
solid core forms of the 'mature' tree.

I wish I could write that simply and develop forms that cleanly. Takes my
breath away. When I try that it quickly gets messy. Maybe it's the
difference between the grid development of the U.S. city as opposed to the
organic internal logic of the sprawl that is London. The weighted
influences of the horizontal and the vertical.

It prompts a discussion about look (poem shape - focus) and control,
roughness and smoothness of tone and texture. Out of a brief exchange I was
having with Chris Stoffolino re 'philosophical irony'. I multiple mailed it
by mistake. But now I'm glad I did.

Thanks,

Hi Tony, curious to hear of your driving / improvising / recording around
Auckland.
I've been using a dictaphone extensively for about 4 years. Take it almost
everywhere and continually engage with recording language materials, notes,
phrases, snippets of conversation (usually not overheard). Both 'outdoors
and indoors' the whispering cusps between 'public and private'. Sounds kind
of creepy (and can attract funny looks) but I take care not to be intrusive
and sometimes repress the impulse altogether. It's intriguing how 'place',
particularly ambience, effects the committing of the work. I asked Ginsberg
specifically to talk about the compositional process of 'Wichita Vortex
Sutra' and although I've never actually transcribed what was a lengthy
interview the gist of his reply was to do with his process of transcription
(the laborious bit) and his use of blue pencil to more shape the poem. I
submit my transcriptions to several other stages of process. But I can
recommend the dictaphone if you're into a rough edged collocation of time
and space. I record in very short phrases (mostly) and run on day after day
into night. Worked on and off with a cumbersome tape machine both in the
car and sat out on the street before that. But I find the dictaphone
terrific. The tapes last for ages (you begin to enjoy accidental windows
from one take into another as practiced more assiduously through cut-up by
Burroughs). Not everything I write is involved with this process by any
means but it's currently a persistent interest.

regards
cris

It's extremely useful to be able to browse these suggestions!

Especially since the NY Times Book Review, etc., doesn't seem to

Bravo Kenneth!

PS. I'll be posting this on the EPC. It might also be useful for

Dear George,  Thanks for post.  Protocols in history,philosophy etc
are interestingly controlled.  There is abook somewhere 1980's called
The Poetics of Philosophy.  Paul Barolsky used the phrase the peotics
of art history in the early 90's and I am aiming at something along
those lines -- have been talking abt a poetics of art history for
quite a while.  Substitute for poetics: "erotics" and you'd have the
philosophers and others really worried.  My feeling is that it might
be easier to work thru anything but professional history mags and go
for poetical marginal ones.

Jonathan's distaste for Hallmark verse is something I'm afraid I share,
although I've learned a bit from its contextual and social discussion here.

But for another take on pop culture, albeit a ways from Hallmark, I've
just finished reading REVOLUTION IN THE HEAD: THE BEATLES' RECORDS AND
THE SIXTIES, by Ian MacDonald, pub. Henry Holt & Co, 1994, which I'd
recommend. It's contentious & sometimes misguided & extremely critical of
aleatoric methods of making art, but it's provoking in its attempt to see
that body of music, recording by recording, as linked to, embedded within,
and in some cases, leading, the events of its times. And somehow reading
a book which is composed of the brief bursts, going single song by song,
is, in its dispersal of energy (although definitely not in its sense of
language possibilities or accomplishment), is something like reading a
collection of poems.

Subject:      Recent & Forthcoming books from O Books and Kelsey St. Press

        The forthcoming O Books (5729 Clover Drive, Oakland, CA 94618 - FAX
510.601.9588; and Small Press Distribution, 1814 San Pablo Ave. Berkeley,
CA 94702): P. Inman's VEL($8.00); Alice Notley's CLOSE TO ME AND CLOSER ...
(THE LANGUAGE OF HEAVEN) and DESAMERE, TWO BOOKS ($10.50); John Crouse's
LAPSES ($8.00) - are available in June 1995.
        Another recent O Book: Camille Roy's COLD HEAVEN is two plays which
are poems - Eileen Myles describes: "Not a play, but an exploding poem for
two bodies." Carla Harryman says: "Roy's second play is a fascinating read
into an imaginary realm that thrives on a distorted association between
life and death."

        Camille Roy has another book now out from Kelsey St. Press. Here
are some Kelsey St. books (2718 Ninth St., Berkeley, CA 94710 - FAX:
510.548.9185; also distributed by Small Press Distribution):
        THE ROSY MEDALLIONS, SELECTED WORK, Camille Roy (72 pp, $10, ISBN
0-932716-35-0): the second collection of writing by lesbian author and
performance artist Camille Roy. These startling witty pieces combine a
playwright's keen ear for vernacular speech with a poet's compression.
Every line has its physical punch.
        "Camille Roy's skittish, predatory language stalks inexplicable,
then pounces. Her nasty luscious stories and poems make up a dyke
coming-of-age novel; set not in the American family, but in our traveling
explosion of body-race-class-gender ...(Robert Gluck)
        "Camille Roy's a pioneer in the new literature which used to be
called autobiography, poetry, theater, prose or even the essay." Eileen
Myles)

        DISTANCE WITHOUT DISTANCE, Barbara Einzig (Kelsey St. Press 136 pp,
$10, ISBN 0-32716-34-2): Einzig's collection of short fictions continues
the author's project of fiction as poem, her unique way of investigating
the life of the hero as a creature of habit. The subject of her stories is
an axis running through sensual perception, language and landscape.
        "How to let things simply happen, wander onto the page and find
their true place ... How to integrate the miracle of wing and tense, the
color of secrets and the market at Cumana and all the contents of
consciousness, seems to me the impressive and ambitious undertaking in
Barbara Einzig's DISTANCE WITHOUT DISTANCE..." (Carole Maso)

        SPHERICITY, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, poems; Richard Tuttle, drawings
(Kelsey St. Press, 48 pp. 7 drawings, $14, ISBN 0-932716-30-X): SPHERICITY
is the first collection of poems by Mei-mei Berssenbrugge in several years.
In this new edition light continues as the medium of small shocks of
perception and revelation which boundaries only partly contain.
        "In SPHERICITY, when a point is silent, it's not a vantage point.
Really there's no vantage point, and the instant of apprehension is solely.
The event horizon is so loaded, the horizon's everywhere: 'the seam, my
experience of your experience, a horizon at dawn, is the instant of
apprehension.' ... Berssenbrugge subjects 'seeing' an event to language.
Comparison itself (of Tuttle's vision and Berssenbrugge's writing) is
Berssenbrugge's long line of the poems which as a measure/shape that
extends throughout the text, is as if there were one infinite line of
'relation' that constitutes the 'event horizon' of SPHERICITY."

        OTHER BOOKS. From Roof Books (Segue Foundation, 303 East 8th St.,
N.Y. N.Y. 10009; also distributed by Small Press Distribution): OBJECTS IN
THE TERRIFYING TENSE / LONGING FROM TAKING PLACE, Leslie Scalapino, $9.95,
ISBN 0-937804-54-1. Has essays on Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Carla Harryman,
Lyn Hejinian, Robert Creeley, and others.
        Joan Retallack writes about OBJECTS: "We value Scalapino's act of
writing for taking us to the rim of a textual eros full of mystery and
lucidity at one but not the same time. These essays evoke multiple senses
of time - a long history of con/texts, a recent past full of local excess
and global abuse, and a present surface tension brimming with developing
meaning. Here is ... a writer who acts on her knowledge that 'we don't have
words at all;' but also that 'the text is erotic not simply by
withholding,' but in so far as it touches 'the rim of occurring....'"

Subject:      Re: Desire

I was really interested to see Dodie Bellamy's two succinct messages about
being "surprised to find such a sexy message on the poetics listserve"
(& also to note, Dodie, your subtle qualification "I wasn't talking of
the individuals--just the discourse"). Dodie's remarks were touchstones
for my own reservations about the Poetics list and recent discussions. I
absolutely do not want to offer the following remarks as an *interpretation*
of Dodie's remarks, but it's interesting that I can better explain myself
by citing Mirage Periodical, which Dodie edits with Kevin Killian.

        "Sexy" is a very interesting word. There hasn't been on the list
much examination/deconstruction of any specifics of sex, and yet there
are many references related to sex, that make sense by drawing on
experiences other list-members have had or know about; sometimes to me,
as a near macrobiotic (a la John Cage) non-druggy person, these

discussions of sex feel as excluding as discussions about good grades
of drug between users. I'm sure, I know, that sex can be (spoken about
as, anyway) refined (as in white sugar and bread) into a blissful high,
and dispensed, dealt, consumed; but it isn't like that for me. Nor is
it the shared riff of coupledom, like the hits you play night after night

on tour to a fanbase that is two people - not even the couple themselves,
but the two personae they are bringing out of each other. For me sex is
part of a life I'm leading of *connection* with people; it is one of
the *many* equally intense collaborations I can have with people, not just
collaborations, sometimes a finding of a higher joint being one has to
surrender oneself to that week. How could I explain to a monogamous sexual
partner the level of incomparable closeness between myself and my fellow
songwriter, that no sexual partner and I could ever reach? I don't write

songs with my songwriter all the time; I could imagine making love with
someone similarly not all the time, cohabiting with a friend who is not
a sexual partner, fostering and adopting a child. If anyone thinks I am
espousing hippydom/free love, let me point out the usually feminist
historical studies of whose freedom there was in free love; it seems little
wonder that people like me would have been reluctant to stand up for the
principles when the right attacked the practioners, when many practioners
don't stand up for the real principle of either freedom or love. I hate
Ginsberg, I hate the prominence of a certain kind of sexy, an unthinking
automatism-sexy, like Grenier hated speech. Hitting on young men? Yes,
AG hits on some other things that need hitting on, but he also hits on
the young, and that isn't an easily laughed off flaw; it isn't like the
flaws I have, and it isn't like the flaws that others would have who would
be as capable as Ginsberg of hitting on the other things that need hitting
on. Alright, he's an old man, now, and the young are warned; but let's
call an end to the continuance of this kind of practice, let's not excuse
it. It is not just the "sexiness" of fame that goes on when Ginsberg hits
on the young; it may be, and more commonly is in my experience, the desire
by a young poet (like all young poets estranged) seeking company and
encouragement; the exploitation of that, the weedling out of sex in return
for attention, is despicable; I can think of one soi-disant language poet
who does this all the time to young female undergraduates, on his
worldwide itinerary of writer-in-residency, and it is just as bad. Just
because the young male has rewards/is accepted for becoming a loveless-sex
junkie, and so seems to have less "innocence" to lose, it is just as cruel
a loss of a potential fine poet to have them made cynical in this way.

For all of the above reasons, it doesn't surprise me that a sex-stupid
dominant culture sees Ginsberg as an icon; it just isn't avant-garde
to be a sex junkie like that. That's them, all of them, this is me,
Ira

I'd thought we'd gotten beyond all that!

Seriously, though; I'm no longer sure I recognize the transcendent being
discussed here (but never having seen it, how should I describe that bear
I would have seen).

Jews, Christians, Moslems and my mother all believe not only that there
is a transcendent realm of apriori truth, but that the transcendent has
manifested itself within human writing (bible, koran, etc.)  The problem
with this is, of course, that the non-believer has only their word for
it.  If we could step "outside" together, we might be able to settle this
problem, but we can, which is why these are called transcendent arguments
("I have before me phenomenon X, which leadse me to believe that it
_must_ have been preceded by phenomenon V).  I've been down that path before.
\
Much mischief has been done by that mistranslation of Derrida (see
Berube's _Public Access_ on this) -- My own account of that notorious
quip is that Derrida was answering the question, "Where is nothing?"
answer -- "Outside the text."

I am I because my audience knows me.

I have a friend who thinks he's a hypochonriac, but he isn't really.  I
tired to get a Hallmark card of the get well/get over it variety, but
that had nothing that suited, so I gave him Thoreau's _Cape Cod_ as an
antidote.

An uncorrectlable line above should read "But we can't."  Next posting
will be from my own computer, upon which I can administer corrections to
myself -- I am self-correcting.  My epistemology, unfortunately, is not.

In short, we can all agree that there really is an outside outside, but
we will do this agreeing in language.  We can't really write against the
language, only against the language as we found it.

In a Hopicentric world, the artist would be the envy of all nostalgiac
non-Hopi writers.

I am I because my little dog passed through the mirror stage of production.
Oh where, oh where can he be.  How much is that basket in the window?

Really, Ira, my intention with my original message was simply to be
playful--I thought.  But maybe it was a passive-agressive impulse to be
provocative.  But, thanks for responding.

I feel strange writing anything on this listserve at all, since I'm not a
member of it--Kevin is.  This is no accident, I think.  I could have easily
had my name included.  I think it is indicative of how I position myself as
an outsider to this community.  If I may be so bold as to offer what I
imagine your reservations about Poetics list are about--I think, as far as
the issue of sexuality goes--this is basically a heterosexual space, and
there isn't the vocabulary for dealing with the sexual-beingness of the
individuals involved like there is in a gay community.  Kevin and I both
live in two worlds that only occasionally overlap--Norma Cole, for instance
has been joining us in that overlapping--a gay, mostly art and fiction
world--and the basically heterosexual poetics community.  In the gay world
the individuals involved are seen as actively sexual beings and it's no big
deal.  In the heterosexual poetics world I get the sense that the sexuality
of the members is treated some kind of secret--a "behind closed doors" type
of thing.  Some younger poets from the East Coast are a big exception to
this massive, and I'm sure faulty, generalization of mine.  Whenever I'm
involved in the poetics community I try to act as neuter as possible, but I
always feel I'm never neuter enough.

I recently read Catherine Clement's Syncope: The Philosophy of Rapture, a
book I cannot go into enough raptures about.  It knocked my socks off.  It
is a book about rupture:  religious ecstacy, passionate falling in love,
orgasm, sneezing, swooning, depression, the dip in the Tango.  If you think
of sex in terms of rupture, it would certainly seem to be an important
point in a discussion of poetics.

The collected edition of Joe Brainard's *I Remember* has just been
republished---by Penguin Books, of all people.

   I remember get-rich-quick schemes of selling hand-painted bridge
   tallies, inventing an umbrella hat, and renting myself out as an
   artist by the hour.

   I remember my high school art teacher's rather dubious theory that
   the way to tell if a painting is any good or not is to turn it upside
   down.

   I remember picture windows with not much view except other picture
   windows.

   I remember the rather severe angles of ``Oriental'' lamp shades.

   I remember, up high, wallpaper borders.

Dear Ira:
     Wow! That absolutely captures exactly my own thoughts & anger
w/respect to Ginsberg--& others--'s ABUSE OF POWER. ABUSE is what it is,
people; we might have the guts, finally, to call it that. I know the
soi-dissant lang po you're speaking of--hell, what younger poet doesn't?
He won this year's "BUTTUFUOCO" Award in _Exile_ (another nominee being
Ginsberg himself).
     A 20-something friend of mine here in St. Paul was absolutely POUNCED
UPON by yet-another drunken, salivating, power-seeking CREEP (a "recently
estranged" lang po) who wouldn't stop harrassing her *all night* DESPITE
PROTESTS, after a reading a few years ago in Tucson (she used to work at
the Poetry Center there; he was the visiting reader). Of course, NO ONE
would help her out, pry the DIRTBAG off of her; that wouldn't have been
"respectful" of the older, "accomplished" poet.  My friend received a
package from this slimeball--an "apology"--a month later, which INCLUDED
COPIES OF SEVERAL OF HIS BOOKS. (!?!)
     Sickening, absolutely sickening. You're right to point out, Ira, that
"hitting on" is rarely just that, & has as much to do with sex (or love)
as rape. It's absolutely about POWER, its ABUSE.
     Thank you, Ira, for calling a spade a spade. The rest of you;  you
might bother lifting a finger the next time you see someone-- ALWAYS
younger, "green"--being hurt like this. It's almost always done in
public--as if, to paraphrase G. Bowering, that makes it "okey-dokey."
     Any of you think this is merely griping or (worse?) mud- slinging,
YOU sit there all evening trying to dislodge some 40-, 50- or 60-year
old's hand from YOUR pants, THEN you tell us we're overreacting.
     Thanks, again, Ira, for giving me the courage to say this.
     Yours,
     Gary

Dear Chris (we met long ago in Philadelphia through Gil Ott at Painted
Bride, nice to talk with you)

The Ian MacDonald who wrote the book about the Beatles is described on
the book jacket as follows:
"Formerly deputy editor of New Musical Express, which has long been at
the forefront of reporting on popular music, Ian MacDonald is also an
accomplished musician and composer. He is the author of The New
Shostakovich, the widely acclaimed, definitive biography of the
twentieth-century Russian composer. He lives in London."

That's all I know about him except that he's a very confused & sometimes
political thinker, often annoying, yet very perceptive about music, and
provoking about its connections to politics & history. My guess is he's
not one of the MacDonalds you mention.

BACK FROM THE INTERMISSION

This *Freely Espousing* update, the first one since 7 March, is organized
primarily in calendar form and is meant to supplement previous Updates (in
a few particulars) as well as to circulate information about developments
in the last month.

From our perspective, the struggle to preserve federal arts funding is now
at a strange juncture.  Key figures from the corporate media and the
ideological right (cf. the John Silber editorial reproduced here from the
Congressional Record, below) have recently come out in favor of preserving
the NEA in some form and the question appears to be shifting from one of
brute survival to what kind of "re-organization" arts funding will undergo.
For instance, single author grants look to be a major casualty in the
latest battles (cf. Ralph Regular's remarks on 16 March, also below).  This
means more power to the managers, and less to the makers, of culture.
Imaginative long-term alternatives to preserving the bureacrats while
eliminating the artists are still urgently needed!

As always, corrections, additions, and further speculations are welcome.
Sentimental though it may sound, we hate nothing more than uni-directional
information flows.

POETRY FLASH

*Poetry Flash* 259 (March 1995) contains a brief report on Freely Espousing
under the somewhat inexplicable title "Flashback."  The account is on the
inside back cover (p.39) and aside from the title and an intro graph that
locates us in "Provincetown, Rhode Island," it ran pretty much as we had
(hurriedly) written it in the week following 28 January.  Unfortunately,
Flash editors decided not to run an account Kevin Magee and Myung Mi Kim
had put together about a Bay area event on 27 January.

=====A CALENDAR OF INFORMATION=====

6 FEBRUARY: CLINTON BUDGET
Under Clinton's proposed budget, the NEA would be funded at $172.4m, the
NEH at $182m, and the IMS for $29.8m.  These figures represent a 3%
increase over current funding levels.

28 FEBRUARY: NY ARTISTS OPPOSE CONTRACT
<cf. Espousing 2/17 for press-release; Brenda Coultas of the Poetry Project
reports that the event, while raising only a modest sum of money for
LitNet, did achieve its principle goal of building solidarity among NYC
artists and writers.  Look for further events.>

1 MARCH:  MICHAEL GREENE ON GRAMMY AWARDS
Michael Greene, CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences,
delivers a pro-NEA speech (and provides the advocacy 1-800 number) in the
opening moments of the Grammy broadcast.  Usage of the advoacy number
spikes tremendously.

14 MARCH: NATIONAL ADVOCACY DAY
From reading the papers, one knows only that Garth Brooks, Michael Bolton,
and Kenny G. urged Congress to maintain federal funding for the arts
(Brooks meets with Newt Gingrich, etc.  We're working on getting a
de-celebritized account of the day, but since follow-up rarely matches
build-up this may take some digging.  If anyone receiving this Update
participated in the days events, e-mail us your impressions.
        Further Note: In a Sunday New York Times op-ed piece (19 Mar 1995:
E15), Frank Rich describes the impact of this intervention as follows: "For
the first time in the culture war of '95, the anti-N.E.A. forces were
thrown on the defensive." Rich attributes the development to Michael
Greene's assumption leadership in pro-N.E.A camp:  "A Georgian who
overlapped with Mr. Gingrich at West Georgia College, Mr. Greene first took
command at the Grammy Awards on March 1, when, in defiance of CBS dictums,
he gave an endowment-advocacy speech with an 800 number (651-1575)."

16 MARCH: HOUSE RESCISSIONS PROCESS [FY 1995]
By a vote of 260 to 168, Florida Republican Cliff Stearns's amendment to
the House rescission package--tripling the cut to unobligated NEA funds for
95--was defeated.  A spokesperson for the National Assembly of Local Arts
Agency characterized this as "a clear victory" in that seventy-five House
Republicans crossed party lines to defeat the Stearns Amendment and keep
the rescission figure at its original $5m.
        From Stearns's remarks introducing the Amendment:
"My colleagues, remember, this has to go to the conference committee.
Traditionally, historically, when it goes to the conference committee, they
cut it even further down. So I say to my friends here in the House, let's
make at least a modicum of a cut, 9 percent total, so if it goes to
conference and it comes back, we will not be left like we did last year
with a 2.5 percent reduction after we labored for hours on the House floor
to get just a mere 5 percent" (*Congressional Record* H3290-93).
        From Ralph Regula's remarks:
        "I just want to advise Members of the situation. In the
subcommittee, we took out $5 million from NEA, remembering last year we cut
it 2 percent on the floor and sustained that in the conference. That $5
million comes out of individual grants. There will be no money left in the
NEA for individual grants which have been the problem. None. Zero.
        If this amendment is passed, this will have to come out of the
grants all over the United States to small communities with symphonies,
ballet, and museums. It will mean the concert on the mall on the Fourth of
July and Memorial Day, I hope many Members have seen it on C-SPAN, it is a
great thing. Basically, if you vote for this amendment, you are voting
against those small amounts that reach out across the United States for
educational programs, for the small groups within the communities, for the
grants to the State arts commissions. You are not voting against individual
grants. We have already eliminated all the money for the individual grants
in the subcommittee which was ratified by the full Committee on
Appropriations.
        The Committee on Educational and Economic Opportunities will have
to hear the question of reauthorizing the NEA, so that is the place to deal
with the problem. If we do not want NEA, we do not have to reauthorize it
for fiscal year 1996 and prospectively. But let us not cut out that little
bit of money that is being spread across the United States to many of the
things that you cherish in each of your respective communities"
(*Congressional Record* 3290-93).
        Further Note: As of the 15th, there had been six NEA-related
Amendments allowed.  Only the Stearns Amendment (tripling the rescission
cut) was actually introduced.  A breakdown of the six may be of interest
with respect to FY 96 budget struggles, so here it is:
        *three were by Phil Crane (R-IN): one to rescind all unobligated
funds; one     to rescind $15m; one to rescind $10m.
        * Bob Barr (R-GA) offered an amendment virtually identical to
Stearns's.
        * Finally, Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) planned to offer an amendment to
restore the $5m rescission cut to the NEA.

16 MARCH:
John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee,
presented an illustrative list of spending cuts (to make up for the
proposed Republican tax bill) that included elimination of the NEA and NEA.


23 MARCH:  COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT OF 1995
The Senate Commerce Committee passed telecom legislation that included an
amended version of the Communications Decency Act of 1995, commonly known
as "the Exon Amendment." This draft was introduced by Sen. Slade Gorton
(R-VT).

24 MARCH: SENATE RESCISSIONS PROCESS [FY 1995]
The Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator Mark
Hatfield (R-OR), met to consider the FY 95 rescission package.
        Note: This was a somewhat disappointing development; if the
consideration of rescissions had been postponed until after the upcoming
recess the NEA/NEH could have proceeded with scheduled awards.
        Further Note:  The Comittee recommended a $5m cut in FY 95
unobligated funds for NEA.  While the figure is the same as it was in the
House, the Senate Committee's recommendation did not stipulate that
individual grants be targetted.

27 MARCH: OSCAR AWARDS
Although less focused than the Grammies, the broadcast did include pro-NEA
speeches by the President of the Academy and Lifetime Achievement honoree
Quincy Jones
(and Jamie Lee Curtis was wearing her postage stamps).  The publicity also
occasioned some backlash; in the Providence Journal an op-ed pounced on the
contradiction of a profit-driven medium like Hollywood cinema pleading for
public monies for preservation.

29 MARCH:  STUDENTS ACT AGAINST CONTRACT WITH AMERICA
"Students at universities around the country held rallies, marches,
teach-ins and vigils today to protest both proposed Federal cuts in
education and the Republicans' Contract With America, which they said was
responsible" ("Students Protest Education Cuts at Rallies Around US" by
Peter Applebombe, NYTimes 30 March 1995).
        For information, contact: the Campus Activists' Network (CANET),
which hosts the CAN-ER mailing list, a forum for campus activists working
to stop cuts in government support for higher education.  The list is
facilitated by Sarah Lund of Student Action Coalition at Kent State, who
will try to keep discussion focused on activism around  tuition and student
aid cuts.  For more information on CANET, send any message to:
canet-info@pencil.cs.missouri.edu.

29 MARCH
Senate (floor) consideration of FY 95 rescission package results in
proposed $5m cut to NEA, and $5m to NEH.

5 APRIL: HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS [FY 1996]
The House Committee on Interior Appropriations (chair, Ralph Regula) will
hold a meeting to consider 1996 funding for the NEA at 10:00 AM in Rayburn
B308.  Jane Alexander is scheduled to testify.

JOHN SILBER ON THE ARTS IN AMERICA (Senate - March 30, 1995)
>
>                              [Page: S4840]
>
> Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a thoughtful article in the Boston
> Globe entitled `Funding the Arts Enriches the Nation,' John Silber,
> president of Boston University, provides an eloquent reminder of the
> importance of the arts to the spirit of our Nation. President Silber
> effectively rebuts the negative myths about the National Endowment for
> the Arts and states the necessity and desirability of continued
> funding of the arts . NEA represents only one-half of 1 percent of the
> Federal budget. The program it funds and disseminates to neighborhoods
> and communities across America are eminently deserving of this
> moderate level of Federal support.
>
> I commend this article to my colleagues and I ask unanimous consent
> that it may be printed at this point in the Record.
>
> There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the
> Record, as follows:
>
> From the Boston Globe, Mar. 20, 1995
>
> Funding the Arts Enriches the Nation
>
> (By John Silber)
>
> The 104th Congress has brought with it an open season on federal
> support for culture. Members of the congressional leadership have
> proposed defunding public broadcasting, and two former heads of the
> National Endowment for the Humanities testified that it ought to be
> terminated and advised the same fate for the National Endowment for
> the Arts .
>
> The most common charge made against public broadcasting is bias toward
> the left, and those who would impose a death sentence on two
> endowments continually trot out the same horror stories.
>
> With regard to the NEA, the cases in point are some items in an
> exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, an alleged work of art
> called `Piss Christ' by Andres Serrano and a piece of blood-spattered
> performance art by Ron Athey.
>
> The NEH has subsidized a ludicrously tendentious set of standards for
> the teaching of history and has funded the Modern Language
> Association, the professional association of literary scholars, as it
> deconstructs into vulgarity and irrevelence.
>
> These genuine horror stories are not so much the doing of the
> endowments as irrepressible eruptions of contemporary culture. It is
> very likely they would have occurred without government subsidy. We
> live, after all, in an age when John Cage was taken seriously as a
> composer.
>
> But these are only the horror stories. The solid achievements of the
> endowments are ignored in favor of their few sensational mistakes.
>
> The NEA has provided startup funds for a vigorous movement of regional
> theaters and enriched the musical life in the nation through the support of
> orchestras and other
> performance groups. The NEH has, among other activities, supported
> some of the most distinguished programs on public television, such as
> `Masterpiece Theatre' and `The Civil War.'
>
> Such successes have enriched the intellectual and artistic life of
> millions of Americans, and they have been far more influential than
> the comparatively few failures.
>
> Nor is it true that PBS is, as a whole, a liberal enclave. There are,
> of course programs on PBS made from a liberal perspective and
> sometimes this perspective amounts to a bias that distorts reality.
> But PBS is also studded with programs produced from a conservative
> perspective.
>
> And the great majority of PBS programs are about as free of ideology
> as is humanely possible. Consider one recent case, a history of the
> Cold War called `Messengers from Moscow.' The final episode of the
> series was made up largely of interviews with Soviet politicians,
> bureaucrats and generals. Most of them agreed that the Soviet Union
> had been a fraud, and that the US challenge, orchestrated largely by
> Ronald Reagan, had brought the Soviet system down and made them see
> reality.
>
> Jimmy Carter appeared as the man who first terrified the Soviets by
> considering the neutron bomb, and then was snookered into abandoning
> it by a massive propaganda assault. A Russian general explained that
> had the neutron bomb been deployed, the Soviet strategy of
> overwhelming NATO with tanks would have been rendered useless.
>
> This politically incorrect program was produced by a PBS station with
> major funding from the NEH. It is representative of federally
> subsidized culture at its objective best, and it is impossible to
> imagine it on commercial television.
>
> If we extended the standard of perfection now being applied to PBS and
> the endowments to other institutions, we should have long ago
> terminated the Congress, the State Department, the presidency and
> every known agency of government. In addition we should have
> eliminated all hospitals, schools, colleges and universities and dealt
> with all churches as Henry VIII dealt with the monasteries of England.
>
> The NEA has frequently endorsed the notion that the sole duty of art

>
> Public broadcasting and the Endowments consume only 1/50 th of 1

I just received word that the brilliant alto sax player and composer
Julius Hemphill died yesterday, at 57.  If you've listened to early World
Saxophone Quartet, you know his work.  If you have never heard him, get a
copy of _Dogon A.D._ and listen carefully.  Julius was a great friend to
poets and often worked with poets' texts in his compositions. Since his
illness began to make it difficult to perform, his compositions have been
presented in public frequently by the Julius Hemphill Sextet.

If we could only listen to each other as attentively and inventively as
Julius listened to the other musicians in his bands . . .

Hi everyone,

I did want to say publically to Gary, thanks really deeply for your response
to my mail, it put a lot of the verve in that I was too reasonably avoiding.
        Also, Dodie, thanks too for your response; I'm sorry I didn't make
it utterly clear that I really enjoyed the pleasantry of your original message,
that I wasn't offering a reading of it, but moved, laterally, to touchstone
off it.
        A lot of what you say brilliantly contextualises what I was trying
to say; one of the things I love about Mirage is the fact that writing about
sex is so common and happy in it, that all sorts of things come out into the
open. One is that its writers clearly are also readers of Mirage, and realize
that to write about sex for it is not to be unusual per se; and this in turn
creates a creative impetus to present sex differently, not simply as a given
or a rebus (I'm almost certainly using this word wrongly) but as a genre, to
be added to in detail, questioned, opened up, written about thoroughly; as a
result, a lot of the issues I was describing in my post have room to breathe,
and do come out.
        I agree with you absolutely that the avant-garde space is so often
heterosexual; one rarely sees the same deliberate care over always writing
the reader as s/he or she, when discussing desire, longing, fantasy; such
that these things become conventional, channeled, rather than free, open.
A lot of my own politics come from active participation in the bi movement
where, I often think for the spurious slightly numbnut reason that people
think being bi is about never being fulfilled in one's lust for a whole
gender by one partner of that gender, non-monogamy is the key discussion and
workshop issue. Polygamy is a very different thing from promiscuity, is the
one thought I have to say nearly every day versus unthinking prejudice. But
an issue I haven't got onto the agenda as much as I'd like it got there is:
as I was saying in my message, that the intense heart also makes me
polygamous, with collaborators, lovers and friends "competing" (hopefully not,
in fact). There is, of course, the most common point made in polygamy
workshops, that lovers in more than one sexual relationship often envy their
lover's *friendships* more than other *sexual* relationships - but that's
not fully what I mean, as I'm talking about *art* relationships, *perception*
relationships.
        You're absolutely right, Dodie, in my experience that these are
commonly discussed, non-feared, maturely-discussed issues outside usual
heterosexual space, and thanks entirely for your posting.

Ira

Hi, this is really from Kevin and not from Dodie.  Dear Gary Sullivan, I
can't decide how disingenuous you're being when, in describing the horror
of sexual harassment, you ask us how would you like it if some 40, 50, 60
year old guy had his hands down your pants, as though the increasing
decades made the horror more exponential.  As though if the guy was 30 it
wouldn't be so bad and 20 maybe actually okay or groovy.

Please clarify on this important point.  Otherwise you're summoning up some
hypothetical bogeyman to scare young poets & playing into a social
construction of a predator (the predator is incredibly old, ancient, even
tho' he may try to look young) (age itself is horror) (the older one gets,
the more vampiric the sexual predator becomes as he needs the young blood
of poets) (the prey, finally, ages much more slowly than the old, 40, 50,
60- year old predator?)

Yours-Kevin Killian, aet 42

Greetings to all friends and acquaintances on the list, which I have
recently joined (and thanks to "cb," who, incidentally, has the same
initials as I do).  I have been enjoying many of the discussions on the
list, especially those on "close reading" and "hallmark cards." Thanks,
Maria, for your insightful comments.  Also thanks to Ken for the compiled
list of fascinating things people are reading.  I wish I had half the
time it would take to look into all of them.

My one observation about the list so far (and this is based only on about
a month-long perusal of its contents) is that a lot of the postings seem
to be more like "private" conversations between two individuals than
information or discussion that would be useful to the community as a
whole.  Is this a fair statement, or am I missing something?  Often these
messages seem like they could just as easily be sent to one person than
to 200.  I'm not trying to "restrict" anyone's use of the list, but it
seems like with the ever-growing numbers of messages that come in
(sometimes nearly 30 a day) some consideration could be given to how
interesting/relevant things are going to be for everyone (and how
much time it takes to go thru and digest all the messages.  There was also a
question recently about dividing the list into more specific interests.
What is the status, or history, of this idea?  How would it work?
Anyway, thank you all for your knowledge, wisdom, and sense of play (free
or otherwise).

Chris

Please excuse me if I modestly remove my name from this byline. I sent my
post about Gary and Dodie's before receiving Kevin's. I think, as ever
Kevin, you raise vital points about what slips through and into Gary (and
my own) fierce remonstrances about sexual violence. Absolutely, agism is
terrible, and is going on under cover of this debate, which is really
about power and responsibility. I can think of a lot of visual artists who
can get a lot of power when very young and misuse it, which *would* be
yucky if it followed the lines of the abuse of a fan who wanted to get some
encouragement as a *person* and *artist*, as Gary and I have been saying.
There remains, however, the issue of seniority, taking on the trappings of
respect as a senior and distinguished (Ginsberg) or political and radical
(the unnamed soi-disant langauge poet), but not buying the whole package,
which is one's own responsibilites to behave ethically if one is selling
oneself/agreeing to be sold as a political or senior figure. And, even if
not for that, it's yucky to not take no for an answer, and yucky, as Gary
says, for everyone to stand back and let the powerful (let's not say older)
visiting artist harass someone who has said no.
        Of course, yourself, the delightful Kevin, who was such a courteous
and generous (intellectually and hospitably) person when I visited San
Fransisco last year, and who remains an open, utterly non-harassing and
non-violent, friendly face and person, are utterly right to refuse this
agist stereotyping. But I know so many who fit it; nevertheless, let us keep
the discussion precisely focussed, and talk about *power* not *age*.

Whose freedom was there in free love? For as the Customs Man would have said:
'everyone there is in chains". Out of the verifiable mouths of babes and
lionesses comes the plaintive singing 'b-o-r-e-d   f-r-e-e; free as the win
. .'

It is the poet who has nothing left to contribute who trades off their
previous 'success' by abusing and exploiting the image of the romantic -
bohemian (often under the cloak of rinks and rugs (sic)) thereby projecting
back onto society the stereotypical image of the poet which 'society' still
projects onto them because of their predictable revelling (o rage rage
against the dying of delight) in modish vacant husks  -  like the cynical
vacuity of empires trading on and off their former 'pomp and glory'.

You're right, Ira, sex is more than churning bodyparts.  We don't have to
read Lacan to know that.

Per Christopher Beach's suggestions about overloading the list with
personal converstions, I'll write to you personally about your lifestyle
choices.

Soon,

Responding to Blair, but not wanting to aleinate anyone else,

        Word of advice do not leave this thing on over the weekend, what
a nightmare.  Forgive me if my train of thought is jumbled but I just
scanned through 60 messages.  Transidental erotica seems to be the hot
topic now, so let see what I can say.
        Reply to Blair's getting a grip on reality, I fully comprehend.
We can not afford to live outside of our era, or generation.  Images can
stand the test of time, see life magazine for evidence of that.  One of
my favorite collections of poetic interpretation of canvas is  Stephen
Dobyns' collection the Balthus poems(1982), especially "Getting Up".
Everyone should check it out.
        Along the same lines he his collection Body Traffic(1990) has
some delightful( I can't believe i used delightful, more like toe
curling) works on desire, particularily "The Body's Curse", "Desire" and
"The Body's Hope".

        i've been thinking about the somewhat erotic aspect of this list
as someone just pointed out there are a series of personal converations
going on and we are all voyuers looking in, salvating for the next witty
line.  And now we can't hold off sex must be discussed.  Which I was lying
in waiting for(actually I wondered if it was forbidden) , but being a new
comer I didn't want to seem too eager in corrupting the system.  sex and
poetry are the two most absorbing aspects of my life and I find Ryan's
idea of writing away from language intriguing if I could combine it with
writing away from sex ( lust, desire, emotion and gender).  The subjective
is what I need to turn away from, but I find that emensely difficult as i

Hey don't you be calling totem poles primitive, native maybe but not
primitive.  And yes they are wonderful.  I often go out to the museum of
Anthropology to sit and read under them, I live close enough to campus
that i venture out there often to lay in the grass and watch the
descendents of Bill Reid( famous Haida Artist) carve away in the long

Dear Charles: Regarding the part of your message that reads:

"While I sometimes find myself working within the trappings of this sort
of thinking, I also wonder what such thoughts have to do with artists
working from and sometimes within such cultures as the Hopi and Zuni, or
hundreds of cultures throughout the world (and by no means are all the
practices of such artists "traditional" in senses understood by their
culture or this generalized Western one) whose practices deserve to be
considered as legitimate or central as any other, including the one in
which we hold ourselves up to Nietzschean prophecies."

I admit I am ignorant of what the Hopi are up to today and have no
knowledge of the Zuni. That these voices may be drowned by so much noise
is no ones fault but my own. If one is enriched by these cultures so much
the better. If cultures like these can proceed without interference from
us (what shall we call ouselves, western, developed, imperial?) they have
a chance to maintain their dignity. If we interfere with their lifestyles
we commit a most obvious act of aggression.

Being a product of western culture, it seems natural to try to grasp
the course of events that have lead us to our present circumstances. If
we can see cultures like the Hopi as something to be understood and learned
from rather than conquered then we have at least begun the relationship
on a footing of respect.

This is so easy to say in the abstact, but with regard to the North
American Indian, it becomes more personal. One cannot deny the damage
that has been done. But in a way, I resent the fact that many people today
are being held responsible for a charter that was made two hundred years ago
between the government of Canada and the Indians. And part of the reason
I resent it is because I see people who have owned a piece of land for
three or four generations, now under attack by any one who has an ounce of
Indian blood in them, claiming that the land is theirs. How does one
begin to right all the wrongs? How do you turn back time? I know this is
slightly off the topic, and I only lay myself open to criticism. But as I
glibly acknowlegde the validity of other cultures in a totally different
mind set, I am acutely aware of the difficulty of settling the
differences that are result of western civilization and its desire to
conquer.

Dear Ryan:
In resonse to your remark

"I also agree with your comments that this is an age abandoning the
transcendental.  But if you write in resistance to language, widening
its holes, flirting with contradictions or the its take upon
"reality", is this not a transcendental pursuit?  Perhaps it's
just mask in place stuff.  (looking forward to your reading
next Wedn. Lindz)"

Several years ago I read a book called "Literature Against Itself" by
Gerald Graff and I think it spoke to this issue. To answer your question,
yes, I think literature can go against itself in order to make a point.
In fact that may be the only way to do it. But I think there is a
qualifer, namely, that you go against something with a purpose. You go
against it to show its fallacy. To resist for resistance sake leads
nowhere and is destructive. To resist with a purpose is a way to move
beyond and that is positive. I don't think of Nietzsche as negative for
the sake of negativity. He saw a truth, in fact he saw several truths,
and expressed them. So if he we can get his drift, that may help us to see
things more clearly. I have read art critics who blame the state of
current affairs in the art world on Nietzsche and while I may agree with
the state of affairs, I would hardly blame them on Nietzsche.

In a way, I see Nietzsche as purely positive. I read somewhere that
Emerson was the only philosopher that Nietzsche did not dismiss or
criticize.

Best wishes

Blair

This Stevens poem is a wonderful appropriation of the feminine; I've
always thought it a wonderful performance of drag: the male poet using
feminine space to reinsert male privilege.  Sort of a confused
Whitmanianism; confused because it tries to reconcile its opposite in the
guise of the male....

Kidding.  Not really.  See Frank Lentricchia's book Ariel and the Police,

I like the proliferation. . . and the conversations, as multiple and
elliptical as they are, with their blend and blur of publicandprivate. .
. . Let desire multiple, it will not be contained by the Law of/or by the
Father (even if he is bored) and the blankety-blank will be the sign of
what remains just out of reach . . . and for good reason. . . .
Laughter. . . .  again, always....

Hi Rae

I don't know about this Powerful or Famous poet
thing either.  I do know that I'm a male who's
been affected by exercises of power and that this
enters my writing and my person.

Power often prefers small spaces, and I think a
poet can use it as brutally as anyone. More,
because we/he/she/they claim licence. Poetry wants
no a priori accountability.

So often Poetry seems to want to align itself with the
good. Aesthetics as a story of high moral endeavour.
The moral claim of poetry seems to me another
power ploy/play. Aberrations like fame are a spin-off.

That said, I wouldn't want someone's fame rubbed off on me.

Dear Gary,
         What appalling parties you have in St. Paul! I know, and Ira's told
you how totally corrupt it all is out here in NZ, but to be utterly frank
with you I have never witnessed anything remotely like what you describe.I.
Is it something to do with the provinces?  I guess you get a steady stream
of scumbaggers from the big cities, do you? We get hardly any 'cos we're so
remote. Lyn Hejinian, who's in her 50s and pretty famous as far as we're
concerned, has just been here; she certainly kept her hands to herself, and
everyone did adore her. Maybe its different in Wellington--Ira can tell you.
We used to have pub readings in Auckland but since sometime in the 80s when
clubs and cafes took over they lost what cool they had.It's so important to
set the right ambiance for readings, don't you think? People are more likely
to behave properly then. I launched my last book in a dealer gallery, got
someone in to do the flowers and had the food catered. Get away from that
Boho atmosphere you know?

Gary,

What I don't get is the point of identifying your out-of-control poet by
an aesthetic? Over the years, I've seen this sort of behavior from
virtually every tendency within the New American Poetry and its heirs
and my friends who studied with Richard Hugo tell me life is no prettier
out in that pasture neither.

Rae is right about poets and power, but often younger writers project a
kind of power on their elders. Look at how worshipful the hangers on at
the Factory were towards Warhol. Did Gerard Malanga acquire power? Look
at the sainthood that Coolidge projects onto Kerouac in his big review
in VLS.

At the Berkeley Poetry Conference in 1965, the young (teenagers and just
past) gay poets I knew worked hard to try and bag a Ginsberg for their
trophy wall. From a distance, star fucking always looks pathetic. And
when it gets turned around (the older more "famous" or "powerful"
chasing after the younger more vulnerable) it looks even worse. When a
beat generation novelist puts a gun to the head of a young grad student
in order to get some gratification--this does seem to have happened--or
if people have their clothes ripped off by the Vajra guard, then it
seems just fine to me if the cops get brought in. Ginsberg's mistake, I
think, isn't in hitting on 16 year olds, but rather in serving as a
cover for a group that acts as if power is not an issue and it's okay to
do the same with 8 year olds.

this issue of fame/power and such butts right up against the sex. harassment
controversies continuing to reverb. through academe and institutional settings
in general... there are times, as ron indicates, when the cops should be
brought in... there are times when appeals should be made to rules explicitly
designated for such abuses... and there is also a more diffuse, equally
problematic and less generally acknowledged eros attendant to such---shall we
say?---transactions...

in the most recent *utne reader*---with the cover story (worth catching too)
"cyberhood vs. neighborhood"---there's an excerpt on p. 37 with the byline
"in praise of student/teacher romances:  notes on the subversive power of
passion"... it's by bell hooks (excerpted from *shambhala sun*)... while
i have local reservations, as i typically do with hooks' stuff, i nevertheless
found assertions such as the following provocative, and perhaps pertinent to
opening up *this* discussion some:

"Throughout my years as a student, I was always mindful of the way in which
devotion to a teacher within a learning community, whether in a classroom
setting or in a religious context, can arouse erotic longings. Passionate
pedagogy in any context is likely to spark erotic feeling.  I have known such
feeling as a student and experienced it as a teacher."

hooks goes on to admit to sexual relations with "older male professors," and
with a student re which "the unequal power relations between us were a source
of tension and conflict we did not resolve"...

Keats were the more 'serious' poet, opened up and jettisoned into the arena
by a 'highbrow' playwright prominent in 'the National Theatre'  -  thus
setting the 'high' 'low' cultural ideologies into play) is often used to
demean and deny new work. Controlling an agenda by controlling the spheres
and terms of reference is an old ploy  -  one of the most effective. A
limited mapping of territories for discourse can be seen as either
'focussed' or 'blinkered', dependent on your points of view.

     In humane interactions one of the most dangerous of all tendencies is
to enforce a belief that something once explored and seemingly
comprehensively dismissed is therefore consigned off limits as being for
all time past its sell by date. Having said which the work of others past
and present is of course there to be learned from  -  and challenged.

Ron,

I absolutely agree with you that Ginsberg's support of the North American
Man Boy Love Association is very nasty.

But I don't why the hell everyone is trying to redefine who the 16 and
18 year olds are, and never once accept that there *are* young men, as
young women, who may be very promising poets and also in their personal
life very vulnerable and isolated - not only because being interested
in difficult poetry does isolate and alienate you, but also because there
may be personal factors. Anybody remotely queer (and I include people
who sleep with the opposite gender) is likely to get a lot of routine
verbal abuse, and feel the presence of hatred for all same-sex behaviour
and/or effeminacy (I certainly don't equate the two), which frankly
fucks your confidence and affects your self-worth sexually, which is
exactly what a lecher can take advantage of. And, to take up further the
Nambla link with Ginsberg, anyone who has been molested in any way as a
child is similarly very vulnerable to being leched by someone offering sex
in the name of love.

This isn't just an issue for poets' power, it's an issue for anyone's
power, so by all means I'll agree that poets don't have power in the
sense of *superpower* like Spiderman or Catwoman, but they do have power
that anyone has over someone vulnerable - and thanks to Nambla, Ginsberg
or any of us has 3 groups likely to attend poetry readings who are
vulnerable, as I've described. It remains, Ron, an issue connected with
avant-garde poetics and not just all poets, not because it's isn't common
to all poets, but because the degree of isolation I'm describing in one
of my groups is greater the more difficult and avant-garde the poet is
himself/herself or is the group he/she sells himself/herself on. I could
find many devoted Thom Gunn fans to talk over my passion with, only a
handful of Ron Silliman fans, or Carla Harryman fans. I just think of
how Ezra Pound always shared out any prize money he got with younger
poets, and think that's how you do it if you believe in art.

   Well, I know it's a complex issue. I just wanted to point out that the
level of power this mysterious Old poet has is not a very great one. In fact,
it's mostly in the mind of the beholder. What negative consequences is he
really holding over the head of the mystery Young lady?. I hope I don't get
confused with Camille Paglia here, but I'm just saying that the less famous
person has some responsibility here too. If she/he really lets some creep paw
her for hours in public just because she thinks he's somehow eminent, then
what does that say about her? The young woman in Gary's post was portrayed in
oddly Victorian terms, almost as a damsel in need of rescue. She is portrayed
as essentially powerless. I guess I found that troubling.
Enough said?

There is no normative sexuality is there? There is not two sexes, or four
sexes or six sexes but at the least a sex for every act imaginable and
at most a sex for every sex thought thought in every sexed body?
     And doesn't this relate to poetry (funny how folks got a sexuality
and a literature around the same historical moment or maybe not so
considering hist. rise of the bourg.) in that there is no normative poetry?
No normative for reading/writing/sexing poetry? And if it is true as I
think is clear that poetry is in some sense always already a seduction, then
may it follow that poetry being a consensual sexual event between multiple
readers/writers across the body of a sexed text is as much about sexpower as
any sexual event (and in this way I try to braid the various threads of recent
posts)?
     Therefore everything goes, in sex and poetry, except of course that
everything cannot go because everything comes from a context of powersex
relations. Our sexed bodies, whether textual or tactile, in some sense
imaginative constructions/fictions, but isn't this where the fun comes in?
All of us drag queens, butches,femmes, acting out a fantasy of historically
determined sex and finally I think this where sexpoetry can go from here
which is to penetrate/be penetrated into/by the fictions of our sex? Woops,
am I talking about narrative?
     Thanks, Eric.

Subject:      Re: Desire, responsibility, etc.

Kevin, Ed, & others, I really regret my agist remark, feel awful having
made it. A very stupid, cruel and thoughtless thing to have said. I take
full responsibility for it, apologize, and hope you can forgive me. It
doesn't, of course, matter how old someone is if s/he's harassing someone
else. I was overreacting to something George had said re Ginsberg: "Do you
expect him to hit on other older poets?" That made me very angry, and I
didn't think well enough through my response. I was speaking of instances
where someone had said--repeatedly--"no"--& where that "no" was not taken
seriously. Ed, I'd hope you'd know me well enough to know I'm not an
advocate of either censorship or repression. I feel terrible not only that
my post was agist, but that it seems to have lead you to believe I *am*
advocating these things.
     Wystan, Ron, how did you manage to transpose St. Paul, Minnesota for
Tucson, Arizona? The woman who related the events that occurred in Tucson
is now in St. Paul, but the events, again, took place in Tucson.
     Ron, this all originally came up in a discussion about Ginsberg, & in
that discussion I thought I made clear the relationship between
aesthetics/behavior in that instance. You're right, though, to point out
that harassment itself has nothing to do with aesthetics; I do think, at
least in Ginsberg's case, his aesthetics get used by others when
"apologizing" for some of his behavior.
     I don't "get" Rae's post, Ron, or your reading of it. I don't follow
how you can say that Rae is "right about poets and power" (she seems to be
denying they have any--am I misreading that?) and then, "Ginsberg's
mistake [is] in serving as a cover for a group that acts as if power is
not an issue..." Could you clarify this apparent contradiction?
     Rae, everyone--including poets--has power. It hardly matters whether
or not they seek it out or even want it. My wife Marta, when she was
sixteen, told her mother that her (Marta's) stepfather had been sexually
abusing her--this was while Marta & her mother were in the car, and her
mother's response to this, either not wanting to believe that her second
husband was capable of doing that or not wanting to deal with the
responsibility of that knowledge, ordered Marta out of the car. They were
somewhere in the middle of Stockton. Marta got out, has been home only
once--with me, many years later & while her stepfather was away on
business--since. I think Marta's mother was in a position of (admittedly
unasked-for) power, and--through denial--misused it.  There's nothing
wrong with power. It's the abuse or misuse of it (& denial of power can
easily lead to abuse or misuse) that Ira and I are talking about.
     This relates to the "responsibility" dialogue. Ed, I'm surprised that
you think so poorly of the word, considering that you seem like one of the
most responsible editors in the U.S.  Like Kevin & Dodie's _Mirage_, your
_Talisman_ is one of few magazines that feels, to me, like the product of
"responsible"  editing. Not simply that it comes out regularly, but that
it doesn't feel--in comparison to _Sulfur_ or _Conjunctions_--like a
closed, "tenure-based," arena. _Talisman_ and _Mirage_ are two places
where I'm always delighted to find work, & a lot of it, by people I'd
never heard of before. (_Mirage_ provided me with the first opportunity to
read Ira Lightman's work--though some was also printed in _lyric&_,
another personal fave.) I may well be projecting or otherwise misreading
by seeing that as "responsible" editing, and my notion of "responsibility"
might be silly, reductive and/or irrelevant--and if so, please don't
hesitate to tell me, & to do that en length. While I appreciate Colleen's
enthusiasm for the economy of epigram, I usually get more--here,
anyway--out of somewhat lengthier, detailed statements/arguments/points of
view.
     Finally, I'm constantly surprised reading responses to
posts that take statements made out of what seem to me to be genuine
concern or a particular way of thinking, feeling or "being," and flatten
them to "strategy." Am I naive in believing that a good portion of the
posts I've read (in the 2 months I've been reading them) might actually be
representative of how people think, or feel? If they're not, or if someone
feels they're nothing more than canon- or tenure- or cred-pitching, it's
beyond me why anyone who felt that way would waste their time reading them.
     Yours,
     Gary

Dear Rae:

A longer post about this is bouncing around in e-space, will probably
show up after this one. Wanted to address your "Victorian." Yes, the
young woman had responsibility. Unfortunately, in this situation, she had
at least two competing responsibilities. She was the person in charge of
reading-coordinations. She was new to the job. It was her responsibility
to make arrangements for the readers, and also, simply, to "be there,"
for the reading, & so on. She was not powerless, but her newness to the
situation, her wanting to "do a good job" probably played somewhat into
her "allowing" (assuming saying no, but not leaving her job-post, is
"allowing") what transpired to transpire. She had a number of things
going against her: Newness to the job, youth (i.e., less
"life-experience" than someone older would've had), and a non-supportive
environment. There's a reason why more rapes or acts of sexual
harassment don't get reported than do. Another issue you're not
considering is shame, that the victim of sexual abuse of any kind often
-- despite whatever the events -- tend to blame themselves and/or
experience an enormous amount of shame. More people that I
know *have* been sexually abused, harassed and/or raped than not -- and
in all of these instances the person on the receiving end is in conflict
w/respect to their own "participation." It's a very complex issue, and
not fully understood by "it takes two to tango"-type dismissals.
        Yours,
        Gary

I'm surprised by the backlash against Gary Sullivan's condemnation
of sexual harassment.  A "liberal" attitude toward the problem can
only serve to reinforce the inequities of the status quo, it seems
to me.  Dear Ed Foster, would you defend Clarence Thomas by saying
that Anita Hill "wasn't exactly in nursery school"?  Rae Armantrout's
question on whether poets really have any power strikes me as a bit
disingenuous.  If someone is a poet, is that person therefore incapable
of sexually oppressing others?  How can anyone deny that academic &
literary settings are rife with status and power games, including
sexual ones?  It may be "un-cosmopolitan" to denounce that situation,
but the first task of activism is to vanquish cynicism.

The following is a letter I wrote on Tuesday at home.  I have tried
unsuccessfully to get it out as an attachment to a post.  It is a
reply, in part, to a back channel post from John Geraets.  I'd like
to share it with the net, though.
[I should add the following annotations: James Baxter, NZ poet,
 collected by Oxford U.P., Colin, is his friend Colin McCahon, NZ painter,
 who painted series of paintings of the Statins of the Cross as a memorial
 for Baxter in 1973; Stefan is my son, 11 years old, approaching 12, Sean
Hoppe is a rugby league player, a fine winger, playing for the Auckland
Warriors.]

A LETTER ON THE NET FOR JOHN GERAETS

Dear John,

  Do you regard me as a rival or as
a collaborator? You are much mor likely
to end up as a boxed set of CDROM-multimedia
poetry than I am. I lack the will.

My effort is elsewise but would like to find
common ground.  The electronic forum gets to be
really interesting when it is used for intimate
correspondence, done

in a public space.  The questions you ask me had
me feeling like an ikon for an uncomfortable while.
I decided I didn't want to be *groovy*.  The public
status too easily forces a simplification that

is traductive rather than reductive. {traduire/
trahir} Translation is always a betrayal as it lays
one idiom over another, stifling the one beneath. It
can breathe life into a corpse. Also.

But what I wanted to say was:

I've always wanted to do something famous, be in the
Encyclopaedia of World Fame. (It will be mine! as Wayne
says in Wayne's World -- a White Stratocaster.) I'm really
taken with Baxter's "Jerusalem Sonnets" 39 poems (Steps, Steppes)

dedicated to Colin.  Thinking how dear old Colin returned the
compliment.  Poetry is a good genre for stating that which
one would like to be permanent, memorable, marmoreal (rather
than hyperreal -- here today gone tomorrow --). This is the

consequential chain of thought regarding being an ikon.  I want
to be an ikon in another category, maybe superstar, maybe saint,
very unlikely.  How abt poet? Hmm, good one, nice call...but
that's not what I reckon I do best. What I do reckon on is to do

with pictures, and on that one I feel like he who cracked the genetic
code or something Nobel.  My mother would be glad, though would have
no idea what it was all about, and would continue to regard me as a
nice enough person, but one who had not at all succeeded as intended.

But I don't reckon being an ikon would be really any good for what I
am
doing.  It would be a serious distraction to have press at the door.
I observe Rugby League squeezed dry for its investment potential by
TV Moguls.  All the money at the top drains it away from the
amusement seekers who like to play football at weekends {Just for the
kicks}. Eventually the pool of talent empties.  It is just like the
use of Natural Resources.  Whatever happened to Golden Roughies
after=

|||||Sean Hoppe lives up the top of the drive, just moved in, with an
SZ numberplate red Celica. Stefan took him a number of articles of
clothing for him to autograph last night, even tho the Warriors have
lost four in a row.  They'll probably end up in Murdoch's Super
League.||||

its feeding ground was discovered? Here Local Body politicians are
taking over the management of the Auckland Institute's Museum, by Act
of Parliament, removing the scientists and scholars of the Institute
from control, and therefore effectively putting freedom of speech
on issues such as race relations of said scholars and scientists
under direct political supervision. {{Did something like that happen
at the Bishop Museum, Hawaii?}} New Vice-Chancellor Carson, in
Auckland's University is talking
about precisely the same issue when he
sees the Government preparing to change
the composition of the governing Council
of the University

so that the majority would be government appointees.
Academic friends who think I am just paranoid may well find
themselves wishing they had acted sooner.  The present initiative
recognises that money will talk loudest in the end and that

the University like the Museum could be forced to agree because
Government holds the purse-strings.....

 But in a way, I resent the fact that many people today
are being held responsible for a charter that was made two hundred years ago
between the government of Canada and the Indians. And part of the reason
I resent it is because I see people who have owned a piece of land for
three or four generations, now under attack by any one who has an ounce of
Indian blood in them, claiming that the land is theirs. How does one
begin to right all the wrongs? How do you turn back time? I know this is
slightly off the topic, and I only lay myself open to criticism. But as I
glibly acknowlegde the validity of other cultures in a totally different
mind set, I am acutely aware of the difficulty of settling the
differences that are result of western civilization and its desire to
conquer.

In response to this, a quote from Guy Davenport:

"But of course, this is not so.  The Indians are probably more numerous now
than at the time of Columbus's discovery.  They are a vigorous people.
After four hundred years of stubborn refusal to accept the gift of Europe,
which we have by now corrupted out of all resemblance to anything like
a civilization, they should be brought to the council tables with
all the old treaties in their hands.  The idea that time cannot be reversed
is mere Enlightenment dogma, liberal twaddle.  And the sovereignity of
the State is a totalitarian idea useful only to collect taxes.  Let
the Indian nations exist again within our borders."

Davenport is right, particularily about the myth of irreversible time; We
(meaning us children of Old Europa) trot out this facile little truism
whenever faced with rectifying some particularily painful historical error
(painful to us, that is). We enslave one race, try to massacre another,
and when that doesn't work, we desperately try to subsume their cultural
identities in whatever fictive set of social norms we've fabricated for
ourselves.  When that turns out to be unsuccessful, we comfort ourselves
(and throw off that strange Eurocentric feeling: historical guilt) by
throwing up our hands and saying: "so sorry for your pain, but that was
on our ancestors'(read: backwards, unsophisticated, and therefore innocent
of malice) heads, not ours." Which is, of course, bullshit.  Where it not so,
I doubt that such historical actions as the creation of Israel, Zimbabwe,
the reformation of a Sovereign Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania would (or
should) ever had occured.  Truth is, we took Native American land, killed
off as many as we could, then threw the rest on whatever spare acreage we
didn't have a use for (at least until such time as we needed the oil or
uranium deposits).

Which brings me to point two: why does a farm family have more of a right
to a certain piece of land than a Native American tribe? Answer: because
they are European and because the dominant culture claims to operate under
European customs and laws.  A farmer owns his land precisely because the
State says he owns it.  The whole argument you posit concerning the relative
rights to the land is based on this Eurocentric fallacy, and by expressing
ambivalence towards the processes that led to the current situation even
while tacitly accepting that situation, you end up coming down on the
European side.  Which to my mind, makes whatever ambivalence one might feel
somewhat facile and ultimately self-serving.

Sorry if this post is somewhat strident (no personal offense is intended),
but this is a subject about which I feel particularily strongly, and which
all too often lends itself to a type of liberal hand-wringing do-nothingness
that I find particularily offensive.

This list went 'desire' as CAP-L (which I must admit bores the whole out of

with 'beauty and politics' and ht-lit swerved into 'digital salivation'.

Transcendence or co-incidence? To finish off my little session I can't

              <anielsen@SPARTA.SJSU.EDU>

Thanks to Aldon Nielson for the news of Julius Hemphill's passing. I'd feared
as much, given that his last recording ("Five Chord Stud" on Black Saint) featu
red "The Julius Hemphill Sextet" without JH himself playing, though as conducto
r/composer his presence was indelible as ever. He was playing on the sextet's
previous "Fat Man and the Hard Blues." He seems to have had a special knack for
reaching inside other people's playing. Uncanny. I caught the World Saxophone
Quartet many times over the years and, while he clearly didn't have the energy
toward the end, he still somehow summoned everything around him, like Stevens'
jar in Tennessee.
                  Aldon, is "Dogon A.D." available on cd? It was a cutout on lp
for many years, & probably still possible to skim up in vinyl bins. It's got a
dirtgrit undertone to it that most jazz producers shy away from, as does its
companion album, "Coon Bidness." Pieces from both these discs were done in an
inspired concert at Willisau in '84 by Hemphill's "JAH band"--issued as "Georgi
a Blue" (Minor Music). The LA poet K. Curtis Lyle's poem "Drunk on God" is feat
ured on Hemphill's only large ensemble recording, "Julius Hemphill Big Band"
(Elektra) & well worth scouting down. There are another half dozen of his, but
I should mention the stunning homage by Tim Berne that came out last year:
"Diminutive Mysteries" (JMT), featuring compositions written by JH for the
project, along with a 21 minute Dedalian twist by Berne that will pry your ears
all the way back to the fur.

Dear Gary,
         I am sorry I confused St Paul and Tucson, lack of close reading on
my part. You can tell me if they are very different--one's a colder place
than the otherI guess and I'm sure they both in songs, but in different
songs?

I forgive you for your agism, you'll be glad to know I was not deeply
wounded by it. What did interest me about your post, and here I will be a
bit personal when it is precisely the personal in all this which is a worry,
what did interest me is that having begged forgiveness for your sins you
wanted then to end your post with what I took to be an accusation of a sort.
It was as though you were balancing the books in some fashion.

  There you make this contrast, and it is a heavy moral one, between
expressions of heartfelt concerns and flattening comments reducing such
expressions to those of "strategy". What I want to ask is this: wasn't the
shift you effected in the discussion of Ginsberg's aesthetics to the
personal and thence to the moral the deploying of a strategy, and was it not
reductive of the issues, ie. flattening? I don't mind that the discussion
changed direction--sidetracking keeps the net active.I also consider the
person-to-person character of much posting on the net is one of its pluses.
But that isn't to say I have to accept, let alone applaud, its claims to
transparence.
             Best wishes,
                    Wystan.

Dear Wystan,

Nothing changed because no one did what I asked. Seriously, I agree with
Ira, Gary and Andrew--to say that poets can't/don't have power is
ridiculous. As Ira preceptively points out, the problem of poets' power
is greater in the avant garde world because that world is smaller and
sort of isolated.

In a situation where poets are, for the most part, their own audience,
critics and publishers, having some stature, clout or influence can be a
pretty big deal. Most poets behave as if they're only too aware of this,
whether they admit it or not.

Subject:      Power

I've been surprised at how reified and mystified the term *power* seems
to be in these discussions. There are of course all kinds of power, an
infinite variety of shadings and nuances. To collapse them into a
does/does not binary system seems not of great value.

Most of the power that poets have (and this may be true of large
portions of what old Althusser used to call ideological state
appartatuses) seems specifically conferred by readers and other writers.
Almost a "consent of the governed."

I doubt that there can be many/any of us on this list who have not seen
the underbelly of power at its most horrific at one point or other, and
who have not sworn to ourselves in private (and often enough to others
in public) not to allow that to happen (to us or others) and never if
possible to be the origin of such abuse. Having been raised by a
psychotic who chased me around the house with knives, I can sympathize
with Marta and do. But it doesn't simplify the state of the world much
to know that. When Gary extends the argument to rope in Sulfur &
Conjunctions as tenure driven academic mags, I get lost. Whatever their
faults (and each mag is radically different), neither gives a hoot about
that system of academic power. What we get is not a critique so much as
resentment over imagined exclusion.

(Althusser himself being a pretty good example of how power shoud not be
used....)

My gut agrees when you say 'in poetry, the private is public, completely'
Ed. But something else that wants to qualify is nagging. I'd go for an
embracing 'and between' position  -  that poetry negotiates the public and
private at all stages of its processes of 'production' and 'consumption'.
The interpenetration of consciousnesses. Yuk  -  so much prevaricating

I'm not convinced that's what you meant.

Combining textual and tactile elements in poetry or sex poetry is an
interesting fusion of sense and emotion, (sense in the logical and
physical realm).  I started thinking about what Ryan had said about
writing into and away from the langauge, then combining it with writing
into and away from my sex and my desires.
        I've been readiing Ovid and I like the way he made love poetry
his full time job.  he did not deal strictly with his emotional reaction
to his love of the moment but infused cultural and social implications
into his poetry and the relationship.  He used a narrative voice but
it lacks the  pathetic dribble of "Why so pale and wan fond lover" in the
narrative.  He is erotic and sensual and yet there is some form of
objectivity in his subject matter.  However his objectivity may come from
the basis that he was not monogamous.

Subject:      Consent of the governing

Ron, I guess I didn't explain myself well enough. I put quotes around the
word "tenure" w/respect to _Sulfur_ and _Conjunctions_, hoping that would
encourage a looser reading of that word.
     I'm not talking about academic tenure. I'm talking about "poetry
world" tenure--admittedly more tenuous than academic tenure, though both
are based on seniority and/or politics. I know a number of people in
academia, and though they are all very different people, ranging from
their 20s to their 50s, some with tenure, some at the graduate student
level, all of them complain of, or at the very least freely acknowledge,
academic politics, the role it plays with respect to receiving (official)
tenure or not, the role it plays simply in terms of whether or not you get
a job in the first place. People in offices I've worked freely admit,
whatever their situation (manager or data-entry person), "office
politics." Same for every restaurant, retail, book-review, stand-up comedy
gig I've had. (I've had more than 20 different jobs in my lifetime, and
only a handful of those weren't gotten because I was a friend of someone
who already worked there. In most other cases, I was hired on after having
worked through a temp agency.) The only place in my limited experience
where terms like "politics,"  "tenure," "seniority," "favor-exchanging," &
so on are denied is in the poetry world. We'd like to think we're "above"
all that. I don't think we are. We're human beings, after all.
     There is such a thing as literary politics, as well as literary
"tenure." You, Ron, I consider tenured. You may be uncomfortable with
that, may feel it's "all in the mind," but I think it does have
consequences--good ones--for you, & for others associated w/you. You write
a book, it gets published. A publisher (Drogue) who is denied access to
SPD gains access after accepting your work for publication. (I happened to
tell someone, several months ago, at SPD that Drogue was publishing _(R)_,
to which said person at SPD said, "Oh, we'd rejected them before; but, now
that they're publishing Silliman, we'll have to sign them up.") You submit
to _Sulfur_, the work will at the very least get read.  Please, please
don't try to kid me or anyone else into believing my work (or theirs,
assuming they don't have a book or two out) is going to even be *read* by
_Sulfur_ or _Conjunctions_ editors when we both know very well it probably
isn't--at least, not unless it gets submitted by someone with "pull," or
"tenure." They're *very* exclusionary magazines, at least compared to
journals like _Mirage_ and _Talisman_.
     Ed Foster, what you say about "desire" and "responsibility" I find
very agreeable. Ron, I think Ed and Kevin & Dodie publish work out of a
sense of "desire"--they genuinely *like* that work; I think Eshleman and
Morrow publish based on seniority & politics, first, everything else,
second.
     I don't resent at all that _Sulfur_ and _Conjunctions_ wouldn't, if I
bothered to submit work, read it; I feel as ambivalent toward them as you
do to coverage or not in the _Times_.  I've never submitted to them
because I'm simply not thrilled with a lot of the work they publish.
     Neither do I resent your tenure, Ron; I'm happy for you that your
work gets consistently published in book form; I'm happy for myself, too,
because otherwise I'd have to pester you (as I do with a lot of people) to
send me your work in manuscript.
     But, really, Ron: "Consent of the governed"? Consent of the
governing is what matters. If it were really up to us governeds, our
books would be published, & once published, carried by SPD, and once
carried by SPD, reviewed in magazines, etc. When looking around at all
the books in print, names in big magazines, etc., in 1972, did you feel
you & your collegues had any say in that? Your wonderful piece, "The Soft
Hello" in _Salt Lick_ from that year, I have the sense you were very
dissatisfied with what you saw. Was that resentment of imagined
exclusion?  I don't get that sense at all, Ron. I think you cared, very
much, about these issues. If I'm putting words in your mouth, misreading
you, let me know. Even your "New Hope for the Disappeared," written some
20 years later, has you addressing--less emphatically, but no less
convincingly--these very same issues.
     Yours,
     Gary

other hand, I can see what Ron is saying in a more general sense. I see
all the time how poets encourage and flatter the egos of those they
admire or look up to. Quite often this kind of consent is actually one of
the classic power-seeking (and sometimes protecting) behaviors, known in
the vernacular as butt-kissing. It would be great if this behavior never
paid off, but such is not the case, in either the literary world or the
corporate.

Not having met you, Wystan, nor having ever been to Tucson, I would

In the sense that thinking about something, and then saying it, is
"strategizing"--yes. I gave very little consideration to the shift, which
is not to say that the shift itself didn't occur. I was arguing/engaging
in a dialogue about Ginsberg w/you and others. I said what I thought to
be relevant. You don't, of course have to agree w/me that it *was* indeed
relevant. But I did think it was, which was why I brought it up.

We agree with the first two statements. I have a problem with the words
"applaud" and "claim" in the last sentence. You're implying I was asking
you to applaud something. I didn't go that far. I did suggest we might
accept that people here--forget me in this--other people here are saying
things that they really do believe and/or care about. If I thought genuine
expression of belief or feelings was impossible in this space, I'd leave.
It's bad enough people read subtexts into everything. I understand how
easily that happens, since we're all readers of poetry, almost "expect"
subtext. But it has seemed to make communication here much more difficult
than it might otherwise be. I'm trying to express certain opinions,
ideas, emotions, as well as impart information and sell a few copies
of a book or two--and I think that's what
everyone else here is trying to do too. Sure, there are things going on
under and over the surface of some of this--including in things I've posted.
But everything? I tend to be a somewhat cynical person, but certainly not
wholly suspicious of others, even those with whom--like you, on this--I
disagree.

I wonder, Wystan--are your worries about "the personal" and your disbelief
at the sincerity of anything said here related? Do you think "the
personal" should be kept out of all of this? Would you rather it all be
abstract? Comfortable? Living is not always either.

Yours,

Gary

Subject:      Viktor Sosnora

April 6, Dear Ron, Could you do me the favor of forwarding the following
message to the poetics list and/or whatever other recipients you think
might receive it appropriately and with kindness. Ilya sent it to me (in
Russian) and what I am sending is my translation -- slightly emended for
U.S. readers. Thanks. Much love, Lyn

Dear Friends, The Russian poet Viktor Sosnora is threatened with the
complete loss of his sight. Because Sosnora, who is 60 years old, has
already entirely lost his hearing, blindness would bring about his
complete isolation, cutting him off from life and from his work.
        Sosnora is one of the greatest of living Russian poets. Though
associated with such wellknown figures as Bella Akhmadulina and Andrei
Vosnesensky and other poets of the "60s generation," Sosnora's writing
was for many years banned in the Soviet Union, and it was a Russian
language publisher in the U.S., Ardis, that brought out his COLLECTED
WORKS (1988).
        Over the past six years, Sosnora has undergone three eye
operations in Russia, but his vision has continued to deteriorate. At
the moment, another operation, using advanced techniques, is urgently
needed.
        We have arranged for Viktor Sosnora to enter Johns Hopkins
Medical Center in Baltimore, where the most advanced surgical
procedures appropriate to his condition are available. May 10 is already
fixed as the date of his surgery. Everything now depends on money.
        The complete medical examination and surgery will coast a
minimum
of $10,000. In addition to this, approximately $1000 is needed to cover
the cost of airfare between St Petersburg and the U.S., and a futher
$1000 will be required to allow Sosnora to spend a month after surgery
in the U.S., to allow for medical follow-up and recuperation.
Altogether, then, $12,000 is needed, and most of that must be raised by
early May.
        We are appealing to everyone who is able to do so to contribute
to the fund for Viktor Sosnora. Checks may be made out to "LITFUND (for
Viktor Sosnora)" and mailed to LITFUND, c/o Novoye Russkoye Slovo,
111 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10003.
        Thank you.
        Signed: Joseph Brodsky, Allen Ginsberg, Ilya Kutik, Mikhail

  Dear gary (sullivan)--I just wanted to say one thing about SULFUR...Though
  I have been rejected by SULFUR far more than I've been accepted (I was

  "working class" "beatnik" kind of mag...in terms of 'avant-garde' I had
  only been published in New American Writing and had an essay appear on Kit

  did...furthermore, this was AFTER it had rejected my work with some "pretty
  nasty" words.Though I certainly don't consider it an IDEAL magazine, I respect
  this. Chris Stroffolino

Oh, posh, Gary,

I haven't appeared in Sulfur in years and Clayton rejected the last
piece or two I sent him (with angry notes about how I wasn't reading him
seriously enough).

Sulfur has always published a few younger poets (and Caterpillar before
that, which is how I first met Clayton in the late '60s through d
alexander, long dead I've heard, a college buddy of Eshleman's who
published a great little mag called Odda Tala and who brought me his
address book when I first started Tottel's so that I could write to
Blackburn and Schwerner). Personally, I've always thought Clayton had
dreadful taste in younger poets, even when I was one of them. He's been
much better at older, neglected poets. He was one of the first to really
push the work of Gustaf Sobin in the US, one of the first to print
Dennis Phillips beyond the LA city limits, did really a major job in
getting George Stanley's work out many many moons ago. He's totally
responsible for whatever audience Gerrit Lansing has in the US (and that
alone is a major accomplishment). But most of the younger poets that
Clayton publishes you don't remember. The others--the so-called
tenured--he prints (myself included whenever that happened) are part of
an argument he is making about how poetry in the US should look and be
read. When Adrienne Rich abandoned her old formalist modes in the 1960s
to take a feminist stance, it was Clayton who published her -- not, say,
Anthony Hecht.

But I've never had a small press publisher with even halfway decent
distribution, never had a book of my own poems with more 1,000 copies
(except for Tjanting, which has had a second edition of 600 to add to
the first of 1,000), hardly ever had the same publisher two books in a
row, don't get my books reviewed in any general publication, never had a
tenure track teaching job (tho admittedly I've turned down a couple that
paid less money than I live in), always -- always! --held 40+ hour per
week jobs while I wrote, edited, curated reading and talk series "on the
side." I've gotten exactly one NEA grant (16 years ago), which I used to
fix my teeth, a couple of part time teaching jobs that reminded me of
what poor working conditions teachers have and my home town library
doesn't even carry my books. In 1986, when two members of the Guggenheim
literary panel told me that I had been their "first choice," the
oversight committee scratched my name right off the list -- now that's
tenure!

And, guess what? I have no real complaints. My publishers have virtually
all been wonderful people who were enormously attentive to the inner
dynamics of the work itself, who were passionate in their commitment to
poetry and to their readers. My books have been great experiences for
me. People come up to me on the street and tell me how this or that
passage had some moving impact on their lives (one opera composer once
showed up at my door to tell me that he hadn't written any music in 3
years until he read Paradise and suddenly had a complete score in his
head). I've met many of the most wonderful people on the planet -- more
than a few of whom are on this list -- from Nanjing to Vilnius to the
Canary Islands to Tuscaloosa, and have had the opportunity to give
readings at some amazing places, like a 12th century chapel under a full
moon at midnight in the south of France in a howling mistral. Or the
maximum security library at Folsom prison. Or a used book store on
Maui. These are experiences and friendships I wouldn't trade for
anything.

The life and work of Leland Hickman has always been a great inspiration
to me. Lee showed that you could shape the course of writing in this
society with just ten issues of a magazine if your sense of what you
were doing was strong enough and sensible enough. In his own town, he
was never taken nearly seriously enough and I suppose he may have been a
"difficult" person as so many of us poets are. The only mistake Lee
made was to exclude his own poetry from Temblor. (His _Great Slave
Lake Suite_ is a wonderful book, major in every sense that any poem
would ever want to achieve. Had Lee hung out with the beats in SF in
the 50s or hung with the Rolling Renaissance in the 60s, he'd've been
one of the "household name" poets of his generation.) But the idea that
Lee or I or anyone else you might think of got where they are through a
process of confered seniority bestowed by our seniors is just bunk.
Clayton scratched and clawed his little space of the public sphere out
of a completely indifferent world. One of the real lessons of life is
that audiences are not passed on or down. You build them one reader at a
time.

Besides, more people read my work in Stifled Yawn than they do when it
appears in Conjunctions. (This is not an exaggeration -- journals like
Margin #4/Period(ical) or lyric& or the Impercipient are read
passionately and completely by their readers where Conjunctions is
skimmed and treated far differently -- I always hear back far more from
readers when I publish in smaller mags than when I show up in perfect
binding.)

Gary.
Yes poets are humans and subject to all the political and personal
manipulations of such beings, which certainly influences who publishes
who, when, etc.

and yes the avant-garde is isolated and magnifies, within itself, such
power relations.

But do any of us operate solely within this avant-garde world? My other
work, which has me working much more widely within an arts & education &
philanthropic community, makes me both more aware of the power moves
among various communities, while at the same time less worried about such
moves -- how important are they, anyway? Yes, on a personal level, and
concerning issues of actual abuse, they are crucial and can be
devastating? But on the level of who gets published in Sulfur or by
Drogue or Chax or Detour, are we only aware of how important that is in
the so-called avant-garde community? When we place such importance on who
gets distributed by SPD, what are we saying? Yes, maybe 100 to 500 more
copies of a book get distributed, but maybe not? More people see your
words on this poetics list than buy a good many of the books carried by
SPD. Your generosity in spreading the fine works of Detour Press may
ultimately be more important than distribution by SPD. None of us are
selling thousands of books to Barnes & Noble -- but would that be such a
grand goal, either?

As to Sulfur & Conjunctions, I can't agree with you. I certainly have
some major arguments with both, but I also feel that both have read my
work carefully, including at times before I had published books. Sulfur
has published one piece, an essay on Nichol & McCaffrey which began with
a poem of mine. That was a piece I didn't expect them to be interested
in, and they surprised me, even including an inventive and funny visual
piece from Rational Geomancy. I think the editors of those magazines may
have formed their likes & dislikes before you or I began writing, and
their openness is certainly limited. But I think they publish works they
sincerely admire (no matter how much I disagree with some of those works,
or with the overall sense of the mags). I do not believe their first
thoughts are the reputations of the writers. Still, I don't particularly
like defending them here, when I'd rather speak up for such editors as
you and Juliana Spahr and Spencer Selby and others whose work I currently
attend to with more desire (that word, that passion, again).

I am apalled at the Tucson story. It's such a small world there that I'm
surprised I had never heard that story, despite living there at the time.
But there, in a context often seemingly ruled by the academic poetry
scene, I existed and paid attention mostly outside that Poetry Center
setting, sometimes ignoring it for months and months in a row, thereby
somehow personally denying it its power, or perhaps only deluding myself.

        all best,
        charles alexander

Dear Tony thanks for the letter which made me
feel a bit curly and famous my name on top in
CAPS and all.

Strange how and where things stir responses. My
response here was at the weird way in which
Public Private are construed - maybe especially
on this List, especially lately.  Instance, I
invite you in Public about your margin/mainstream
experience, we talk Private (Backchannel), you
reply Public citing my/our Private (Backchannel)
exchange.  Now I'll send this Public but at the
same time send something Private..dunno why.

Mostly we're pretty affable on the List, elbows
spread, kind smiling.  I like that.  Same time, I
feel that in this medium bot Public and Private
utterances are, as elsewhere, formalized. To me
this suggests that the only Private we have is
Public.  So when I see (in myself, too) the final
appeal being a kind of personal indisputable
integrity ie.  when I claim personal honestly or
feeling or integrity or wholeness - it seems to me
its not open to challenge, dispute.  Our last
recourse.

I like what Marcel Broodthaers was doing with his
conjectural art museum and his poetry books set in
white plaster.

I'm sure confused a bit on this one but I guess in
this talk of power and things the one really
unassailable one is that of personal integrity.

That's what you got me thinking Tony - not your
responsibility for sure, but thanks for your
serious fun letter too. I'm very abstract.

(ps as they used to point out in reviews in nz
literature, I think Jim Baxter had Colin Durning
his Dunedin dentist mate, in mind in Jerusalem writing)

you're absolutely right, gary; there are politics and "tenure" even in poetry, but it's there mostly for those who seek out big publishers and get the jobs, grant, tenure, but the really great poets (bronk, spicer) survive outside. so there's that.

an outsider's comment:  i'm finding the public-izing of what i would have
taken to be (formerly) private spaces to be fascinating... gary and ron:
in your exchange, you each reveal a good deal about your own publishing
experiences, the sorts of things that don't get a lot of air play (i mean,
we're talking an audience here of 200 or so), though precisely the sorts
of things that are typically discussed twixt practitioners... and this
has drawn out commentary by charles a., chris s., etc., along precisely
such lines---who publishes whom, what this signifies, etc...

now the point here for me has less to do with the personalities involved
(or the journals cited) than with the sort of knowledge thus constituted
(apologies for making this a remotely 'theoretical' concern)... this sort
of talk has to do with the nuts & bolts of the marketplace of poetry,
hence i feel it fair to observe that an entirely individualistic reading
of same (ron, you tend in your remarks toward the individual-communal,
insofar as 'success' is concerned) or the more power-oriented discourse
(gary, you seem to me to tilt in such directions) represent in fact
complementary views of how publishing decisions are made, books get
printed, etc... that is, a sort of micro/macro split may be seen to
inhere across your exchange, and i'm not really quite certain (pardon
my beak) that you're really so "opposed" to each other... it's more like
you each seem to be emphasizing a different aspect of the same apparatus
(without wishing to deny actual differences between you)...

just an observation, if you will, perhaps entirely beside the point... i
have absolutely NO experience with any of the journals/editors/poets
you mention other than a few, near-anonymous rejections (as i recall)
from some years ago, so i really can't add a helluva lot to the discussion,
hence, again, my "outsider" status, and my fascination attending thereto...

Jed -- Thanks for word of that tribute piece -- I hadn't heard of it.
I don't think _Dogon A.D._ or _Coon Bidness_ have been reissued yet -- I
thought they were available because the LP I got from a cut-out bin was
an Arista reissue of the original, and I expected it was still part of
the catalogue after Arista re-aligned with Columbia years ago.  Maybe it
will reappear one of these days.

Several years ago, Hemphill did a residency in D.C. with District
Curators, culmianting in a free outdoor performance of his compositions
by a huge gathering of talented volunteer instrumentalists. (culminating,
too -- I'm back on that uncorrectable keyboard again)--

I've been collecting recordings of jazz with poetry, and a chapter on the
subject will be in a book I'm doing with Cambridge.  I love the Hemphill
Big Band sessions, though I'm not thrilled by the poem by my neighbor K.
Curtis.  I'm told the new Henry Threadgill recording has a poem on it.
Have you heard that one yet?  Would be interested in hearing from anyone
who knows of lesser-known recordings of jazz with text.  An old one I
stumbles across recently is a setting of an Elouise Loftin poem by
Andreww Cyrille.

"I stumbles?"  "I" stumbles?  This machine draws my attention to the
oddities of my own language -- BUT

RE _Sulfur_ etc. --  My understanding, gathered from the few newer poets
(which is not to say younger) I know who have been published in _Sulfur_
is that most of them got in by way of one of the contributing editors --
Those who had sent poems directly to Clayton generally received
intemperate replies, though, as some have pointed out here, he
occasionally takes a liking to something in the unsolicited pile & runs
with it, about once a year by my estimation.

It's about as silly to expect him to act differently as it is to tell
writers not to take note of the fact.  The point is to do something
otherwise, which many on this list are doing.

The Beats, the Language Poets, Black Mountain, all knew that they had
little to expect from any of the journals on the scene when they began
(including the more self-avowedly "open") -- and so began many of their
own publishing organs  (& now that they're old and powerful, I read here,
they publish their organs) --\

When I started _lower   limit   speech_ I quoted what I had once heard
Baraka reply to a young writer who asked what advice he had for young
writers.  Baraka told the fellow, "Get a copying machine and start a mag."
I knew that there were many remarkable writers around the country who had
the same difficulties publishing that I had encountered.  The obvious
answer was to try, in no matter how small a way, to get their work into
circulation.

None of this, though, means that we should stifle our criticism of those
who have grown comfortable and resistant.  We are to afflict the
comfortable --  (odd grammar that)

Example, Weinberger's self-righteous intro. to his special issue of
_Sulfur_ wherein he claims that the younger generation just isn't
interested in histroy & offers as proof the fact that he got so few
responses to his open call for the issue, a call that went only to
readers of _Sulfur_.  History, that is, and translation.  It;s easy, if
you don't read or correspond with younger poets who are avid students of
history and frequent translators of poetry, to argue that they're a
pathetic group of ahistorical monolinguists.  (I exaggerate Eliot's case
slightly, but if you've read his frequent intros & essays you know what I
refer to ((he seems to use the words "never" and "only" far more than any
other critic I know))  I suppose it might be hard in a footnote to make
an offer of proof that something "never" happens, probably why most of us
are a bit more cautious.

So, Ron gets published in print runs that are considerably smaller than
those of, say, Sharon Olds, and that are considerably larger, and more
frequent than those of, say, ME.  On the other hand, Ron is a writer of
continuing importance to my reading in ways that Olds clearly is not, and
Ron, unlike Clayton, seems to take every opportunity that affords to
bring to the attenbtion of whatever public he can get to the names and
works of interesting pots who don't have even his limited access to
publishing opportunities.

As to tenure, in all senses, etc.  I find it fascinating, in the H. Ross
Perot usage, that the Language Poets were already accused of being in the
game of trying to get cushy academic posts long before any of them had
gotten hired by a university in a permanent position.  Last time I
checked into this, most of those who had gotten university jobs were
_not_ hired to teach in the creative writing programs.  I took a
different route, and became an Assistant Prof. at a low=rent school
(after 17 years and 17 non-teaching jobs) completely apart from my work
_as_ a poet (I was hired as a critic and lit. historian) --  Ron & I both
have jobs, at least, and can make time to write.  Most of us on this list
are in one way or another involved with the creation and development of
self-governing, consensual postics networks,,,, and that is where we
should look for the new -- I read, and fulminate at, _Sulfur_ , but
that's not where I look to find new poets -- _Here_ is the place for the
new writings to get mentioned, circulated, reviewed, denounced, praised,
re-engendered

power is powerful only within certain contexts, & then only when persons pay
attention (grant power).

When power is ignored, is the center (person) of that ignoring then outside
that "powerful" context (with the result of seeming "powerless"), or perhaps
asserting power in a different sphere?  (perhaps often in a "personal" sphere
only.)

So, can one ignore power in one area in order to open a space for one's
"personal" empowerment, perhaps simply in order to produce something?  And
then to who or what does that production speak?

Follow the power, deepthrought said.  Maybe we should just think & talk about
stuff.  Power is illusory (ill storied).

"Surely, Kelly's affirmation that 'we cherish the poem as a life-
sustaining force' was intended to mean more than tenure. But does it?"
     --Ron Silliman, "The Soft Hello," _Salt Lick_ vol. 2, nos 1-2.

     Ron, Joe Amato may be right when he suggests that you & I are --
despite my "don't tell me" and your "oh, posh" -- not, finally, in
complete disagreement.
     You say that people really *read* the photocopieds more often than
the printeds. Isn't that what I've been saying? Only, you seemed to have
misread that (beginning w/the usage of the word, "tenure") and came to the
conclusion I was suffering from acute "resentment of imagined exclusion."
Are the other people who prefer _Mirage_ to _Sulfur_ suffering the same?
Why *don't* they more than skim mags like _Conjunctions_ or _Sulfur_?
     You say: "Clayton scratched and clawed his little space of the public
sphere out of a completely indifferent world." Of course he did. How else
would he ever have come to our attention? (Ed cites Spicer and Bronk, and
here I'd mention the people who scratched & clawed on their work's
behalf.) If one must "scratch" and "claw" their way to readers, does that
seem more to suggest a generally "open" or generally "closed" system?
     All I was saying, in my initial post, was that the journals that are
more open to newer writers (to more than one or two a year) are more
interesting to me. For that, you call me deluded and spiteful. Then, a
post later, agree with me. Tough love?
     You claim no tenure, and say, in support of that, you've not had many
publishers publish more than one book by you, as though having a dozen
presses ready, willing & able to publish your work is somehow a "minus."
     You're tenured, Ron; accept it. I'm not calling you a dirty name by
calling you tenured; I'm merely pointing out a blessing.  Your resistance
to this has been surprising; it really isn't that big a deal, & I never
intended to make it one. I was, last post, simply bringing you up as an
example of someone whose work will be read at _Sulfur_ or _Conjunctions_.
They are both different magazines, but they are both, *relatively*
speaking, closed doors to work by newer writers. As work by newer writers
is one of my primary obsessions, I'm less interested in them than in
magazines that publish a lot of the stuff. For my purposes, I don't need
_Sulfur_ or _Conjunctions_. Most of the work in them will be in book form
not long after publication in the mags, anyway, so why should I pay twice?
     Marta & I just saw _Hoop Dreams_ tonight. Anyone who thinks poets
have it tough ought to see what these kids go through, are put through, in
pursuit of *their* goals. Incredible.

     Gary

Dear Ron,

Excuse me for jumping in again, but I am so surprised at what you are
saying. Do you think yr name, yr reputation, yr cred, yr body of
published work don't count, and count for a lot at this stage? Do you
think that the only thing publishers consider when you send them a ms. is
the actual writing on its pages?

In yr most recent post you paint this picture of yourself with
some details that might seem to disprove the idea that you have in some
way established yourself. Why else say that you are never published by the
same publisher twice or that yr books never are printed in runs of over
1000? All this means is that you're still operating in the avant garde
poetry world (where print runs are never more than 1000 and where repeat
publishers may not even be preferable). It does not mean that you don't
have a very large rep in that world and that you don't get a big benefit
from that rep. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've had more
substantial books published in this world in the last 15 or so years than
anyone else. I would think this would be a more pertinent fact than yr
points about print runs and not being published by the same publisher twice.

Please don't misunderstand me. I very much respect you and yr work. And
I'm not saying that that work has nothing to do with yr standing. However, I
think it's wrong for you to deny that standing--for the sake of an
argument or for whatever reasons you may have.

Another thing that puzzles me is yr point about Sulfur (a mag that I too
appreciate, along with Talisman, Mirage and others). Yr reasoning there
doesn't seem right, since some friction is a part of Clayton's
relationship with many people that are still within what might be called
his sphere of mutual appreciation and support. For the record, I would
consider myself within that sphere, though of course I cannot speak for
Clayton, and I do not know if he would agree with this assessment.

Lastly, I would like to thank you for bringing up the memory of Lee
Hickman. Lee was indeed extraordinary, and Temblor truly did make a mark.
It's just my opinion, but I believe the big reason for this was Lee's
heroic integrity. He took his job as editor/publisher so seriously, and
he gave incredible attention to virtually all the work that was sent to
him while Temblor was going. Lee's commitment to poetry was definitely
above and beyond the call, and everyone today could benefit from
remembering what he did and how he touched so many.

Yrs, Spencer

Lawdie Lawd, Gary, why split so many hairs & get your knickers in an
either/or twist. I want there to be, so that I may read them, Sulfur
AND Talisman AND Conjunctions AND every small magazine that is being
put out. They obviously have different functions, different aims,
different possibilities. They also have different dross. I read maybe
1/5 of any given issue of Conjunctions, & the same holds true for most
small new mags (though it's easier to read all or most of them because
they tend tyo be much smaller...). Since the invention of the
mimeograph there has been no reason to bitch at whatever you can't
control or have access to. Just cranck that handle.

As sweet as it is to read such things, the operative phrase in your
argument, Spencer, is "I think...." Obviously Eliot Weinberger doesn't
agree with you and I doubt Gertrude Schnackenberg or Amiri Baraka would
and there's no particular reason to think that even a handful of people
on this list would agree.

This isn't to "deny that standing" but rather to be specific about what
that standing is. My work plays a particular role in a subjective map
you have of recent poetry (and I'm flattered by that role, I admit), but
there's nothing objective about that map. There are literally thousands
of alternative maps floating in the heads of other readers. One reader,
one map is the ratio I see and I certainly know that it's possible to
hold somewhat different maps at different times of day, different days,
different months. One thing I do know is that my work doesn't play any
role even remotely like the one you pose in your map within my own
map(s). [I've been living in the Age of Watten myself, but that's
another story....]

When several readers hold maps with significant amounts of overlap,
communities of reading can form and build on these foundations one way
or another. But there's still nothing particularly objective about it
and positing it as such I think sets in motion exactly the sort of
reified literary surface that causes somebody like Gary to feel that
it's a (hostile) solid object and impenetrable. In reality, it's much
more like an ever shifting dream state.

And we've all seen just how invested in creating such sorts of solid
objects the likes of a Helen Vendler or Harold Bloom or Hilton Kramer
can be. That's all nonsense, but when institutions and money get
involved it can become quite sinister. (And what Deep Throat said was
not "follow the power" but "follow the money".)

My point in my previous post was to distinguish (however poorly) between
editors (like Clayton & Brad) who are driven by individual/private
motives and those institutions (like the Guggenheim, most academic
teaching jobs, trade and university presses, and a broader circle of
wannabe institutions, like Poetry Flash) that are INSTITUTIONALLY &
BUREAUCRATICALLY DRIVEN and every bit as much of a closed world as any
posed by the limits on reading of a given editor.

I think (to use that operative verb phrase) that you make a real mistake
when you confuse the engines of your subjective map with those
institutional engines of economic power. Hank Lazer has written some
extraordinary pieces on how those engines function in poetry today and
Jed Rasula has done likewise (and even published them in Sulfur).

Whatever substance there may be in my books or in anybody's books who
works through what you call "the avant garde," it is not the substance
of economic institutions. So that when a Joe Brainard gets picked up by
a trade publisher, there is a meta event occuring as the work takes on a
new life very different from that which the author envisioned during the
writing process. (And it's a damn shame that Joe did not live to see
this.)

I've been wondering about the stratification of institutionality that
has been posited in these postings by Gary and some others. I think that
what Brad and Clayton are doing is much closer to the impulses of Kevin
Killian/Dodie Bellamy and Gary Sullivan than they are to the impulses
that drive the Yale Younger Poets or Iowa Writers Workshop or the
Pulitzer nominations committee. When I grew up as a young poet, there
were fewer layers to sort through, but that doesn't mean that we should
collapse them into the same old boring Them & Us. We're all Us (and,
conversely, we're all Them too).

Love,
Ron

It would seem from reading this last weeks posts that power and denial are
directly linked. Ron and Rae who are more in the position than others in the
discussion are most denying of it! What is the old "s/he who protests too
loudly" quote?

Having worked for Pacific Bell in a variety of management positions for
fifteen years now, I see little difference in the power "games" of our little
poetry world - it used to shock me, but not any longer.  Both worlds assume
that if you are not "playing the game" of political power and influence (it
doesn't matter what that means in terms of the larger outside world - PB
managers have no real effect outside of their power spheres either) you are
either stupid or weak or rebellious -  none of which are the earmarks of
success. It must be a great help not to know you are playing!

For those of us who are neither emotionally nor idealogically equipped to
"play" we learn our own ways, which sometimes are successful, but more often
not nearly as advantageous in terms of the reward system.  - Colleen

We could all benefit from remembering that these two great angels of poetry
died from AIDS.  I know we're all AIDS'd out in many ways but the word
itself only gains in potency from not being mentioned.

We could also admit that we are living in the age of HIV and that all our
writing is AIDS writing whether we know it or not.  I know this is my own
particular King Charles' head but here I go again.  I'll paraphrase myself
(and Sarah Schulman) again when I add that history will judge us not by our
publication record in Conjunctions or anywhere else, nor if we ever publish
another poem again, but on how we responded to this plague in our own terms
in our own lives.  Can I recommend to you all Aaron Shurin's work on a
poetics of AIDS which has been appearing here & there, most notably in the
latest issue of Apex of the M, edited by Lew Daly, Alan Gilbert, Kristin
Prevallet and Pam Rehm?

Later.  I sound like an old nag here but, that's Cassandra speaking through
me, not the "real" Kevin Killian.  I'm interested in the debate about power
(standing, sexuality, harassment, desire) & please let it continue swirling
around me.

1)Chris -- Actually, I think there is a lot of Lacan in my last posting,
but a Lacan deliberately misread by feminists and others interested in
gender. This is a Lacan I am particularly interested in. As for the
phallus, I am much more interested in what he says about the object of
desire when he says WOman does not exist, which we must recognize from
a male heterosexist pov, in that the object of desire as fantasized by
those who have the phallus, ie, the person who desires, does not exist as
fantasy. But of course this assumes that the object of desire is always
feminine and the desirer always masculine. Can we assume that now?
2) Ed: What does it mean to know Poe? Does it mean like, Hey Eddy,
saw yourRaven thing last week. You must have been high when you wrote
that! Which is unfortunately about as far as you get with some critics.
Lacan's reading is only as valuable as it is a use. But can you think
of any reading that is not a use? And isn't the point of Lacan in that
particular essay that use always has a position? My thought would be
that one must always take responsibilty for their position,for their
use. This is not, I must say, Lacan's point.
3) Lindz: I am gratefull to you if only because you focused in on what I
had to say about poetry. I would emphasize though that I am not advocating
a path away from the merely personal, but simply to say that such a thing is
not possible. There is no merely personal.
     I am interested in the sexing of poetry. Remember that WIttig says that
language is gender neutral, but immediately says that to say that is
relatively meaningless because we are gendered and thus gender everything else.
I am interested in this proccess of gendering, and how it is essentially about
fictions, it seems to me. This I think has enormous implications for how we
read and how we write. Implications that have not been explored in poetry.
     Thanks, Eric.

Ron,

I can't speak for Kevin (is that clear to everybody--my opinions in no way
necessarily reflect Kevin's opinions) but I think the openness and
beneficience that drives Mirage's editorial policy (which is mostly Kevin's
doing, I'm rather lazy in my input) is anything like Sulfur and
Conjunctions.  Both magazines, by the way, rejected me (that is, I think I
was rejected by Conjunctions--no one ever bothered to write back to me) so
I'm certainly not objective about them.  I'd heard of Clayton's long
"thoughtful" resonses to work, but to my piece he jotted a note saying he
liked parts but it just went on and on.  I guess I chatter away too much in
my work.  You, know, Ron, women have a history of rambling on and on about
silly things.  But, I know you don't feel that way.  I think you're a great
guy.

Many years ago, I read a poem by Neruda in translation. It was about
how different animals would prefer to be different creatures. It also
contained phrases like 'unlikely skin of the crocodile' and 'volcanic
frauds of the earth.'  If you know which poem this is, I would be most
grateful if you would let me know.

So, how about a story, everybody.  Well, several years ago there was this
graduate creative writing student at SF State who had never been published.
He was ten years younger than me and really eager.  Anyway, he showed me a
poem he had written about having sex with a woman during her period, with
dark lurid descriptions of her menstrual blood.  Not for the squeamish.
Now, Clayton E. happened to have read here in SF at Intersection not long
before this--and I noticed in CE's work a certain fondness for menstrual
blood.  So I told my young friend to submit his poem to Sulfur--and guess
what, it was snapped up immediately!  Coincidence?

You tell me.  Maybe you guys should reconsider what you're submitting.

    Jayne Cortez and the Firespitters (featuring
Denardo Coleman, Al McDowell, Charles
Moffett Jr. and Bern Nix) was released in Eurpoe
by Radio Bremen in 1994 (and subsequently put
out by Tradition & Moderne and Indigo Records,
all, I think, in Eurpoe).

    Joseph Jarman's 'Song For' (on Delmark,
1991) features his reading of 'Non-Cognitive
Aspects of the City' (with Thurman Barker,
among others).

   George Lewis also did that disc for New World

+ HANCOCK OF MISSOURI & BACKLASH AGAINST OSCAR SPEECHES

<from Congressional Record H3855>

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman
from Missouri [Mr.Hancock] is recognized for 5 minutes.

Mr. HANCOCK. Mr. Speaker, Last night multimillionaire Hollywood actors,
actresses, and producers--one after another--got up to accept their Oscar
during the Academy Awards and ranted on national television about the need
to preserve Federal taxpayer funding for the National Endowment for the
Arts.

For most people these petty little tirades about the NEA were probably just
annoying. But I got angry. Think about those spoiled rich elitists
preaching to hard-working, middle-class Americans that America's families
should make more sacrifices to fund a Federal Arts bureaucracy in
Washington.

Nearly all the people in that room were multimillonaire entertainers. God
bless them for being successful. I don't begrudge them their success. But
if they really believe the work of the NEA is so important, they should
start up
a foundation and put their own money where their mouth is.

Steven Spielberg and Quincy Jones could personally fund the Endowment at
its present funding levels with a portion of their annual incomes. Half of
the proceeds from the movie Forrest Gump could fund the Endowment. I didn't
hear any such offers from any celebrities. It is an outrage to have these
people tell viewers across America who are making $5 and $6 an hour or
$20,000 and $30,000 a year that they should be making more sacrifices as
taxpayers so we can have money for the NEA.

I have nothing against the arts . I have personally contributed to the arts
in my community. We need symphonies, community theatres, and local museums.
Unlike the Hollywood hypocrites I have put my money where my mouth is.

But I am definitely opposed to further taxpayer funding of the arts. There
are other priorities in the Federal budget that are just more important,
especially when the arts can and should be supported privately by those
with the means to do so.

The other problem with a government-funded arts program are the bizarre
things that get funded when you trust bureaucrats with taxpayer dollars. I
am not talking about the morally obscene grants, like the pornographic
Mapplethorpe photos and the Annie Sprinkle nudie show--although those are
definitely outrageous examples of abuse. I am talking about more mundane
examples of waste and abuse.

Let me give you an example of a typical NEA grant. My hometown newspaper,
the Springfield News-Leader, did a story on March 20 on a constituent of
mine who recently received a $20,000 NEA grant to aid him in his work as a
poet. A lot of people contacted my office and talked to me personally about
this article.

I will call this individual Mr. Grantee which is not his name.

Mr. Grantee of Willard, MO is a creative writing professor at Southwest
Missouri State University making $42,000 a year-- a salary funded by the
taxpayers. His wife works on the government payroll as a nurse for the
public school system. He says his $20,000 NEA grant will supplement his
income so he won't have to teach
summer school, allowing him to concentrate on his poetry.

Mr. Grantee says: `I will have less stress. I have a clearer creative
mind.' A $20,000 government grant would relieve a lot of stress for a lot
of people, including those who don't already draw a government-paid family
income of $60,000 or more a year.

Mr. Grantee, a very honest fellow, says he has already incorporated the
money into his family budget. He says he used some of the funds to buy a
dishwasher and an airline ticket to a conference. He also says he plans to
buy a personal computer. I can think of a lot of Americans who wouldn't
mind the government buying them appliances or paying for their personal
travel.

We are promised by Mr. Grantee in the article that he will produce at least
one book of poetry and that he will even begin work on a second before the
grant money runs out--books he intends to commercially publish, no doubt,
and for which he will receive royalties.

I have nothing against Mr. Grantee personally, and I regret the need to use
him as an example. But this sort of routine grant is exactly what is wrong
with the NEA. When there are so many competing budget priorities, when
hard-working taxpayers are already so burdened, I just cannot justify
taking money from families--many of them making less than Mr. Grantee--to
buy college professors dishwashers and supplement their Government salaries
to relieve them from the stress of paying bills.

Frankly, it is an outrage. While the flaky, politically correct Hollywierd
crowd on the West Coast may look down on my unsophisticated concern for the
average taxpayer, the time has come to defund the National Endowment for
the Arts and get the Government out of the art business once and for all.

Worthy art--whether it is Mr. Grantees poetry or the local symphony--can
survive with private support. Those who are spending so much energy and
effort now to reserve taxpayer funding can and should turn their energy and
effort toward private fundraising. That includes our self-righteous friends
in Hollywood.

If the public will not support certain artistic endeavors through their
voluntary contributions, I hardly see why I, as their elected
representative, should force them to spend their tax dollars on them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PEOPLE!YES PETITION DRIVE

On 5 April, the People for the American Way launched "The People!Yes
Project"--a nation-wide petition drive to save the NEA,CPB and NEH.
According to their press release, the PAW seeks to "deliver 100,000
signatures bound in books to all 535 members of the House and Senate.
These books will be delivered by a delegation of artists and citizens in
May, before the crucial debates about Arts funding, debates that will be
life and death for the arts institutions and community media that have
proliferated since the genesis of these programs.  We hope to debunk the
elitist myths surround arts funding: American wants funding for the Arts!"

The text of the petition is to read as follows:

"We, the people, petition the Congress of the United States on behalf of
the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowments for the
Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  At little cost to
taxpayers, these institutions have played a vital role in establishing a
vibrant, inclusive, and informative cultural life in America.  We must
protect their survival and reaafirm our guarantee that they can continue to
work free of political interference and threats.  We reason and resolve, we
oppose efforts to 'defund' or further marginalize the NEA, NEH, and CPB."

The drive is scheduled to last from 5 April to 17 April.  If you would like
to participate, contact Gail Melhado or Andy Stettner at People for the
American Way in New York: 1-212-944-5820.

CLINTON'S REMARKS UPON TRANSMITTING NEA 1993 ANNUAL REPORT TO SENATE

<Congressional Record S5401>

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the
President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which
was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.

To the Congress of the United States:

It is my special pleasure to transmit herewith the Annual Report of the
National Endowment for the Arts for the fiscal year 1993.

The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded over 100,000 grants since
1965 for arts projects that touch every community in the Nation. Through
its grants to individual artists, the agency has helped to launch and
sustain the voice and grace of a generation--such as the brilliance of Rita
Dove, now the U.S. Poet Laureate, or the daring of dancer Arthur Mitchell.
Through its grants to art organizations, it has helped invigorate community
arts centers and museums, preserve our folk heritage, and advance the
performing, literary, and
visual arts .

Since its inception, the Arts Endowment has believed that all children
should have an education in the arts. Over the past few years, the agency
has worked hard to include the arts in our national education reform
movement. Today, the arts are helping to lead the way in renewing American
schools.

I have seen first-hand the success story of this small agency. In my home
State of Arkansas, the National Endowment for the Arts worked in
partnership with the State arts agency and the private sector to bring
artists into our schools, to help cities revive downtown centers, and to
support opera and jazz, literature and music. All across the United States,
the Endowment invests in our cultural institutions and artists. People in
communities small and large in every State have greater opportunities to
participate and enjoy the arts . We all benefit from this increased arts
presence, and yet the cost is just 65 cents per American. The payback in
economic terms has always been several-fold. The payback in human benefit
is incalculable.

The White House, April 6, 1995.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE PERCENT FOR CULTURE ACT

On 7 April, the Associated Press reported that Representative Pat Williams
(D-Montana) intends to propose a "1 Percent for Culture Act" that would
effectively establish the NEA/NEH/IMS as true endowments, operating on the
interest accrued annually on the $12 billion Williams proposes to set aside
in FY 1996.  The congressman seeks to establish an "American Cultural
Trust" (which would also provide funding for the CPB) on the basis of a
single appropriation of 1% of the $1.2 trillion federal budget.

The AP story quotes Williams as acknowledging that "[t]his Congress is not
going to appropriate $12 billion in one swoop....  But my first purpose is
to jump-start the reauthorization process. The opponents of NEA have a
strategy of killing it through a simple lack of action in the House."



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24 MARCH--UPDATE ON CPB

The Senate Appropriations Committee voted to freeze Corporation for Public
Broadcasting (CPB) funding for FY 1996 and 1997 at the FY 1995 level of
$285.64 million. This represents a reduction of 8.7% and 9.5% respectively
for '96 and 97. No amendments were offered to CPB in mark-up. Proposed
House cuts for CPB were for 15% and 30% for FY96 and 97. The Senate did not
rescind any funds from Ready to Learn television or Mathline, whereas the
House has proposed
to eliminate both programs. The Senate did rescind $5 million from both
Star Schools and Education Technology, leaving them with $25 million each
for FY 1995. The House had eliminated Education Technology, and moved
two-thirds of the Star Schools program to the Fund for Improvement of
Education, rescinding the final third.  <REPORT FROM ARTSWIRE *HOTWIRE*

Dear Kevin:

Could you say more about Aaron's piece? Also, have you seen Susan Smith
Nash's pieces (in _Talisman_ and _Taproot_) on AIDS and the avant-garde?
A few issues ago in _Talisman_, Aaron wrote a response to a piece Susan
had done on the subject, in which he felt Susan had misread Aaron's
work--I think he said that he hadn't (at that time) been writing about
AIDS, not ready at that point to deal with it in his writing, though it
was something he was (then) beginning to work towards.

Also (this is a lot of alsos, I guess), I was very surprised, reading
Steve Abbott's book, _The Lizard Club_ (which I *loved*), that--because
it seemed so "autobiographical"--there was very little mention of
HIV/AIDS there. It was very odd reading that book, knowing that he had
AIDS and had died not long after completing it, that HIV/AIDS seemed, if
not wholly missing, not addressed very much directly (as he addressed,
his interest in "Hippie" lineage, his day-job, his hangouts, etc.).
When reading _The Lizard Club_ I sort of half-assumed that AIDS & HIV
were somehow being addressed obliquely--felt, in places--but was
never completely sure how much I was reading into that.

Thanks.

Yours,

Gary

Subject:      Digression from the theme of poetry/power/publishing

     I've been following the discussion on poets' power with interest
as it turns towards issues of publication, the economics of poetry--or,
as in Ron's explicit reminder: 'follow the money.'  The distribution of poetry,
highly renumerative as it is (Mr. NEA Grantee living off a handout and
handsome Penguin USA Royalties) has been on my mind as I think
about and begin to work out some of the possibilites of electronic
publishing.
     I've gained from the comments of some POETICS people in other, less
textual spaces, lately; but I wonder if other participants in this space
have also been thinking about writing and reading poetry online.

Wittgenstein writes:

      I should like to say: when I read I feel a kind of influence of
      the letters working on me. . . . In particular, this
      interpretation appeals to us especially when we make a
      point of reading slowly--perhaps in order to see what does
      happen when we read.  When we, so to speak, quite
      intentionally let ourselves be guided by the letters. . . .(PI
      #169/ pp. 69e)

A slightly different take on the 'power' implicit in poetry, in even
the (often more prosaic) language on this list.  Most of us probably
spend hours each week allowing ourselves to be guided by glowing
letters upon VGA screens.
        I hope it doesn't seem too cute/self-reflexive, but
I'd be interested in hearing how some of these questions
of power/publishing (and also engaging poetry) come to bear,
not in_Conjunctions_, _Sulfur_, _Talisman_ etc.--only one of which I've
bothered to be rejected from thus far--but in this space.
        A number of the participants on POETICS have in one manner
or another published writing on the Internet (in addition to the
publication/quasi-publication of posting to lists such as this).
Does this shift the 'power'/lack-thereof/attendant-responsibilites
of poetry/poets?  Is online poetry technologically hyped up
'distribution' or something more complicated?  Does anyone find
different aesthetic/political implications in online writing/reading?

Or, as Ludwig Grenier was heard to ask: "Would it make sense to say,
in these circumstances, 'I HATE PRINT'?  And when I imagine this, can
I then picture a poem in its place?"

In-Reply-To:  <199504081442.HAA18511@>

Dear Ron,

I'm sorry, but yr post is seemingly based on misunderstanding the meaning
of a single word in mine. When I said, "I think you've had more
substantial books published," I did not mean this as a value judgment of
yr work. I was following yr comments regarding yr publishing history. I
was trying to say that I think you've had more full size or perfectbound
books published in this avant garde realm in the last 15 or so years than
anyone else. If true, this is a fact; there's nothing subjective about it.

Everything we've been discussing does not reduce to subjective maps, as
you imply. Poets have power, which is not all traceable to the power of
their writing. Of course that power is relative and of course you can
talk about all kinds of other mostly bigger spheres which make that power
seem minor by comparison. But within the spheres where you and I and Gary
and others have our primary literary activity and audiences, you have a
significant amount of power which is connected to a standing and rep and
cred that you also definitely have.

With All Respect,
Spencer

Subject:      poetry and power

To link two threads, the earlier thread on what poetry does and the
current thread on the power of poets -- if the only power that poetry
yields is personal power of some poets over others, this ain't saying
much.  Political scientists speak in terms of instrumental, structural,
and symbolic power (I would add transformational), and power in its
potential and actual states (I would add virtual).  All we're talking
about here is  the simplest form of instrumental power.  Not a very large
ambition.....

Thank you, Sandra, for your comments on the limits of power, and the
limits as to ambition, in finding small powers so important.

I remember Robert Duncan saying in conversation once that he felt it was
important to write as though the poems had the ability to effect the
world, even change it, even if one knew, more pragmatically, that such
power was either nonexistent or severely limited. Still, such a
conception offers perhaps a more broad discussion of the power of
poets/poetry than the one of tenured versus novice or non-tenured.

I think it might be more compelling to discuss the power of poems or of
language than the power of poets.

Loss,,

Jackson's Cd is _Open Secrets_, has 8 pieces on it,
produced 1993 by Experimental Intermedia foundation
224 Centre St. NY NY 10013. If you want to buy it,
go thru Jackson himself who seels them for $13
(this is what he said to tell others). It's a
great cd, featuring music & many voices, btw, &
useful liner notes.

Jackson will have a number of digitized recordings
on the cd-rom version of _the little mag_ which may
be out as soon as june or july. dig it.

Subject:      Re: Consent of the governing

Ron's response on the subject of "power", tenure, whatever, in wch
he details his own experience, seems definitive. Truly, I hope
this subject will go away, as it is boring beyond bearing.

A measure of worthwhile subject surely must be the difference
which may be made by one response or another. Why, in that case,
does this list produce the opposite when it is composed of
intelligent and passionate people committed to the baseline
language art?

I had a (seeming) endless correspondence more or less onthis
subject in the late 80's or very early 90's with Spencer
Selby who at that time maintained as he seems to wish to continue
to maintain that the poetry world is nominalist; i.e. people
build magazines, booklists, reading series, etc. around
names rather than works. And that this translates into a
kind of power and status which is not an exact mathematical
function of the value of the work currently streaming
(dribbling?) from that source.

So? Yes, this is true. For one thing, most judgments about
current work have little value in relation to any long-term
assessment. The Cambridge Platonists were the hottest thing
going hundreds of years ago, rather in the way that "theory"
functions now. Read'em lately? For another, it's useless to
think about poets in so immediate a manner. Your work is a
lifelong arc (well, a much more complex shape than that);
its weaknesses, lapses, gaps may contribute to strength.

Neglect, lack of official endorsement, surely these are
relative; surely too they are a just reward for the restless
and radical desire to write. To imagine that there is a locus
of power relevant to writing that exists outside the authority
of that desire, which is self-permitted and demanded, is
a foolish illusion. Knock long enough at the door of the
one place which you imagine it matters to be published
(i.e. Conjunctions, Sulfur) and no doubt you will be
let in and learn that the place and object associated with
idea and work are strictly irrelevant. Must it not be the
case that the energy invested in imagining the opposite
cd be better invested in re-imagining one's work? Isn't there,
for every one of us, someone who imagines that we have more
power than they? Someone I think is powerful, another who
thinks me so; someone Gary Sullivan imagines to have
more power than he and than is just (I pick Gary as a
random example, not singling him out), and another who
thinks that publisher-poet GS is a figure of the power
position that this other has not attained?

I studied for years with Hannah Arendt; the two most important
things she taught me were 1) a social/political issue must
not be confused with one that is individual -- one's own
sense of marginality is irrelevant to the issue of how an
institution like poetry marginalizes its participants.
The other... well, this has been a bit stentorious, so I'll
reveal the third thing Hannah Arendt taught me, and this
involves a story.

For a quarter a small group of students did an intense reading
course with Arendt on 2 works of Marx and Hegel. We worked very
hard, and apparently we were good students, as she said near
the end of the course that she wanted to reward our work by
taking us out to lunch at the Quadrangle club, the faculty
club at the U. of Chicago. It seemed to us, none of whom
had been in this sanctum sanctorum (save, perhaps, one or 2
of us who bused tables there -- as I did with Paul Butterfield,
but that's another story), that this must signal our
true arrival as intellectuals.

The day arrived for our lunch, and we sat at an oblong table;
Hannah was at one end, and I had grabbed the other. "Miss
Arendt, Miss Arendt," I cried out -- earnest young intellect
looking for arrival and power that I was -- "let me order
the wine; I've been reading some books about wine."

Hannah dissolved in laughter; "Tzome tzings (one wd have to
have heard her rolling guttural penetrating voice to
appreciate this I fear), Tohm, tzome tzing we do not learn
from books!"

That was the most important lesson she taught me. The same
to you.

and of course there are programs such as eudora (that i once had access to,
alas) that enable offline composition and reading, if by offline one means
not 'connected to' a mainframe (again, via modem or local wiring etc)...

so to begin a discussion of online writing (poetry or otherwise) one almost
must of necessity pull out (if you will) the distinction between the screen
(your local system, mac, pc, what have you) and its connection to (or
disconnection from) other such entities (through mainframes of one sort or
another)...

this said:  i understand *you* to mean by online NOT the simple presence of
an active stand-alone computer, but the merging of that computer with other
such computers... which would NOT, again, for those using something like
eudora for mail, constitute much in the way of online-ness save for that
brief spell during which eudora dials in, sends out mail, checks and downloads
mail to one's terminal... that is, email in itself may represent nary a whisper
of the sort of online dynamics i'm certain you're alluding to... and if this
is the case, if sending a poem, for example, to a list can represent a more
thoroughly online activity for some than for others (given disparities in
technologies) then we're all not starting from the same assumptions as to
what it is that we take to be an online experience in the first place...

sorry for going on so, i think you understand why i've had to... it's a messier
topic than it appears at first glance...

Dear Aldon Neilsen:

I've heard the Steve Lacey Nine recordings of Bob Creeley's poems.
They're wonderful. The recording is called "Futurities". I don't know
the label as I only have a taped copy that Bob gave me years ago, but
it's well worth tracking down.

Do you know "New Music--New Poetry" with Amiri Baraka, David Murray,
and Steve McCall? It came out in 1981 from something called India
Navigation Comany. A very powerful performance (speaking of power)
(what kind of power would that be?)

Also, slightly more oblique is Marilyn Crispell's "The Kitchen
Concert" where she plays a composition called "What of It I Refuse
Awakens the Wide-Eyed Stone" which, though there are no lyrics, is
based on the poem of that name by Nathaniel Mackey.

I also have heard that Don Byrd is putting together a CD that will
include work by John Clarke and Charles Keil from their Bard Song
performances. Those are truly awesome.

Best,
Mike

The Label is Hat Hut with which Lacy has made a number of recordings.
It first came out on vinyl[hat art 2022] (I preferred that one because
it had my liner notes) & was recently reissued on cd.[hat ART cd 6032]

Check also CLANGS by Lacy's Double Sextet. It includes poems by
Appolinaire, Gaston Chaisac, Mario Merz,Kurt Scwitters & Wassily
Kandinsky.[hat ART CD 6116]. His MOMENTUM [on NOVUS cd, # 3021-2-N]
has songs with poems by Brion Gysin, Abu Nuwas, Herman Melville &
Guilia Niccolai!

On LIVE AT SWEET BASIL [Novus 63128-2] you can hear PROSSPECTUS, one
of the trademark songs of the sextet, with a poem by Blaise Cendrars
as well as MORNING JOY, with text by Bob Kaufman.


Lacy has written hundred of songs -- in fact I have heard the rumor of
2000! --with poems as lyrics.This is just what comes to hand at the
moment.

Dear John,
         I'm happy to backchannel too.  I thought what we were
talking about backchannel was pertinent to discussions going on
elsewhere on the List about private and personal and also what Wystan
sd abt Ginsberg's performance of dis-embarrassments.  I was following
suit there.  Why can't you be a person, as "famous" or not as anyone
else on the list, as if you don't do a good job on the page and also
as a reader?  Maybe that got swamped by considerations about
Ginsberg's morals.  I couldn't get too excited: the British press has
better sex scandals.  20 politicians have resigned in three years
there.  That's a different scale of Power from entertainers and poets
visiting (Joyce Carol Oates did that scene over, or do I remember
wrong) and finding or expecting groupies.  Hell, this isn't 1960's
anymore (or 70's), morality has changed a lot.

      Do you NOT listen to
yr old Chuck Berry records, or NOT
read Ezra Pound?  I couldn't make
it out AT ALL.  How about you?

Lacy's group has done quite a number of text-based performances over th years,
but none (that I've heard--but he's recorded so much!) spookier and livelier
than Irene Aebi's rendering of Melville's very late poem "Art" (on Lacy's RCA
disc "Momentum" from 1987).
                            A few others: Henry Dumas's poem "Black Paladins"
on the lp of that title by Art Ensemblists Joseph Jarman & Don Moye, with the
late great South Africa bassist Johnny Dyani sitting in; Sonia Sanchez's "A
Blk Woman Speaks" on Fred Houn's Afro-Asian Music Ensemble suite "Tomorrow is
Now!" (Soul Note, 1985); and I'd add John Carter's final installment of his
Roots and Folklore series, "Shadows on a Wall" (Gramavision, 1989) [J.C. also
among the greats passed on in recent years--I saw him play many times in L.A.
, sometimes in the most casual circumstances, like loft parties, but he was
always immensly calm & *on*]. The pieces in "Shadows" are all compositions by
Carter himself, & seem to me better integrated with the music than most texts.
Sometimes musicians are too disposed to honor the poem by fizzing & hissing
sub-sonically in the background, then letting loose when the words are done.
That's *not* the case in the new Threadgill Aldon mentioned (was it Aldon?),
but that one is so superbly engineered by Bill Lasswell you can practically
hear everything, no matter how deeply recessed amidst the 2 tubas, 2 guitars,
& 2 drummers.

& speaking of words & music: don't forget Cecil Taylor, about whom Chris
Funkhouser should have something to add...

Given recent discussions, I must quote the following from Ron's _N/O_:

perfect for tenure
is the night


Since it's night out here, and I'm tenured, let's set this to music and,
as Tom Mandel suggests, put the subject to bed.

Thanks to everybody for the lists of jazz & text recordings, and please
keep them coming.  I only knew of about 1/2 of those mentioned so far.
Steve Lacy seems to have done more than anybody else on my lists -- He
must be even more of a reader than Archie Shepp.  Eric Dolphy did an
early Town Hall concert with poetry, but I've never seen any ref. to any
recording of the evening having been made.  If anybody knows anything
further about this, let me hear from you.

Ron's Friday post may be various things, but "definitive" is not
one of them. I don't believe Ron was even trying to be definitive, which
is to his credit.

Tom likes to characterize what I am saying, then attack this
characterization. "Nominalist" is such a characterization. It only
signifies one aspect my concern (an aspect I may have stressed a bit more
in the past than I do today).

The exchange I had with Tom took place from June '89 to January '90, and
it involved approximately ten letters from each of us. This was when Tom
lived in San Francisco and when he still referred to me as "Spencer."
Needless to say, Tom was not an unwilling participant in this exchange. As
I recall, Tom's main frustration was that he couldn't get me to agree with
him enough.

Tom says the power issue is boring and I say that it is tremendously
important. What is boring to me is how averse people are to discussing
something that motivates so much of their behavior.

This is not about individuals. I never said or implied that it was. Nor am
I speaking from books, nor am I speaking out of frustration for myself (I
am doing just fine) or some sense of my own marginality.  There is no
confusion of issues; the issue *is* social/political and that has always
been the drift and focus of my concerns.

To imagine that the only power relevant to the writing is the power which
exists inside the authority of that desire is definitely an illusion. I
passionately wish that it was not. I wish that the work was as primary as
people want to believe or say it is. I wish that literary politics, who
you are and who you know and who you like and who you don't and who likes
you and who doesn't, didn't matter so much.

To say the reverse, to say that only the power of writing matters, is to
say the problem has already been solved, or that it never existed in the
first place. Saying this is the best way to make sure that the problem
never gets addressed. Saying this is the best way to make sure that a very
serious problem only gets worse.

Good Morning and Good Night,
Spencer Selby

well i'll be damned... i like the quote aldon nielsen cites from ron's work,
and in fact i appreciate the drift of tom's response to spencer to the extent
he's exhibiting frustration with a frustrating topic...

but something's bugging me about this, folks...

aldon, never having made your acquaintance save through your fine book on
'reading race,' something about you're being tenured, and posting it so, has
an unfortunate ring of dismissiveness to it (similar to ron's (imho) poor
choice of salutations, "posh")...

i'm not playing sides here (and i'm not tenured, and i haven't lost my sense
of humor), but why is it i'm finding myself cringing at the *tone* of several
of these posts?... it's highly unlikely that a topic will 'go away' simply
because some folks voice 'boredom' with it... voicing such boredom will in all
likelihood sustain the thread (i thought most of you would have understood
that by now---and yeah, i'll risk coming off in this assertion as just a wee
bit certain in such knowledge)...

i don't believe spencer is whining, either... because each post on this topic
of 'power' has had the effect of progressively unearthing more information
(such as the exchange twixt tom and spencer) that i, and no doubt many others,
have not been privy too, it strikes me that there are personal histories and
motivations at stake in the convictions being voiced that probably 'explain'
the more dismissive gestures...

BUT this isn't a justification for same... so why not drop the attitude as much
as this is possible? (i'm talking to everybody)... it doesn't help things, esp.
because a good portion of the studio audience really is interested in better
understanding how these spaces may be used to cultivate a more polysemous poeticsensibility, both personally & politically...

By way of a too quick response to Ken's question/topic concerning reading and

 I love the freedom of THIS medium.  Seems weightless, so accessible.  Yet
there's this little bit of mourning as I remember ahead to a time when paper

Joe, you have reminded me of what an uncomfortable topic power can be, and of
the way that words can really front for other words we'd just as soon blot
out.  I don't exempt myself from these tendencies, not at all.  You just hit
home with what you say, and I appreciate it.

Subject:      Re: Consent of the governing

Went to a reading/publishing party for a good new little magazine called
Antenym on Sat. and was struck by what the editor Steve Carl had to say in
his statement of introduction called "Humanity and Politics":

"No longer merely mediating, politics determines how people will stand with
regard to each other.

Today, politics governs more and more the relations between people, as more
and more people become afraid to commit themselves to the attempt at genuine
communication, concern and compassion, which all involve listening. To listen
is to stand within another's speaking, to move one's viewpoint into the
perspective of another, to share experiences. Instead politics provides an
easy interpretive grid that allows us to get a handle on people, to identify
"where someone is coming from" without having to actually deal with the
reality s/he experiences, without having to engage that person's speaking,
without having to "expend" or "invest" one's energy actually communicating
without the incentive of gain.

As politics (which involves the communication of only power relationships
between people) holds more sway, humanity is more and more buried by
reductive modes of relating, with it buried, politics becomes more and more
mean-spirited, if indeed spirit of any kind can be said to be involved."

This is taken from the middle of a three page essay, but the point is that
others in the poetics field find the power and politics discussion a fertile
field - why the impulse to suppress it on this list? Colleen

Ed sed:

Yes - yes the poetry is different from the power games and the rhetoric -
thank goddess - or we'd all be in deeper than we are now! I don't mistake the
poetry for the poet or the rhetoric - as Charles A. said quoting Duncan
"important to write as though the poems had the ability to effect the world,
even change it, even if one knew, more pragmatically, that such power was
either nonexistent or severely limited." somehow I just think if we want our
poems to effect the world it would be nice if our behaviours were influenced
by that ideal.

Mike and others:
                The Lacy/Creeley CDs are on Hat Art (6031 and 6032) and are
available from Cadence, Redwood, NY 13679, (315) 287-2852, along with all the
other wonderful material from Hat Art, fmp, etc.  Cadence, incidentally, is
well worth the subscription if you're at all interested in "creative
improvised music," as they call it.  Also Cage, Feldman, Scelsi, etc.
      I heard the Julius Hemphill saxophone sextet (actually a septet, with
Julius soloing occasionally from his wheelchair) last fall.  The first set
was one of the most thrilling sets I've ever heard, and the second damn
near as good.  And I still recall just how astonished I was when I first
heard "The Hard Blues" on the Coon Bidness LP back in the 70s, that mix of
Texas "gutbucket" blues and a smart "avant-garde" edge.  So sad to know
there'll be no more such news, that we've lost that intelligence....
      To whoever (sorry to have forgotten) was interested in jazz/poetry
mixes:  I believe Cecil Taylor and Clark Coolidge performed together a while
back in NYC.  I heard Coolidge read the piece later, but without, alas,
Cecil.  Perhaps it's on tape?--in which case I'd love to get a copy.

Hope this proves useful.

P.S.:  Cadence is much cheaper than buying from Tower, etc.  And a "good cause"
as well.

Poetry & jazz has become almost a "canonical" synthesis, still a potent

poems set to music other than jazz?  I've come across a single speciman,
on Crammed Discs, a Belgian label specializing in new music/ambient/neo-

Celan, Apollinaire, Gottfried Benn, Paul Eluard, Delmore Schwartz, and
Bob Kaufman, and music by Samy Birnbaum & Benjamin Lew. I'd be interested
to learn of other recordings of extra-jazz poetry.

To Aaron Joron--Here are just a few perhaps evident examples of poetry
set to music other than jazz.  There's Elliot Carter's setting of
Ashbery's "Syringa" (along with 3 poems by Frost) on Bridge Records;
Philip Glass's "Hydrogen Jukebox," with Ginsberg reading and others
singing (thankfully!) on Elektra Nonesuch; Oliver Knussen's setting of
Rilke (and Winnie the Pooh) on Virgin; a two cd tribute to John Cage,
which includes work by Jackson MacLow and Anne Tardos, as well as Frank
Zappa's rendition of 4'33" (with photo of the performer and appropriately
no bio); John Cale's "Fragments of a Rainy Season," with its use of Dylan
Thomas; and "The Subject" and "Blind Witness News," operas by Ben
Yarmolinsky with librettos by Charles Bernstein.  I believe I passed up a
Lou Harrison cd that's relevant to your interests, but can't recall.

We're off the Hallmark trail, but I must report how horrified I was today
as I looked to buy a card for a former colleague (in his early 40s) who's
been institutionalized for early onset Alzheimers.  The two genres seemed
to be jokes to the effect that "you're losing your mental faculties,
aren't you?" or "life gets better with age."  Cruel.

Subject:      Re: sexual harassment

Phew, I've just been away in London for the weekend, primarily to attend
a meeting of the two rival camps in avant-garde British poetry, the London
school and the Cambridge school. There were ten readers, eight of whom
were men doing second hand Zukofsky (Londoners) or second-hand J.H.Prynne
(the Cambridge people), two women, one a brilliant formalist who can only
continue to get bookings if she does erotica, and one very bathetic and
confessional. One of the Cambridge people got up to read "parodies of
Language Poetry" which were quite simply pathetic, and rhythmically and
grammatically much closer to Prynne, not remotely knowledgeable about LangPo;
I felt like they must have felt thirty years ago if they'd attended an
avant-garde meeting where someone did pathetic parodies of Olson and Ashbery,
and then did stale Eliotisms themselves!
        There was no active sexual harassment, just an absolutely stifling
dominating maleness, no attempt to engage or involve the small handful of
women who'd come, nearly all as friends of readers; and plenty of young
male bards in their twenties happy to sell you their work or magazines full
of yet more Prynne and Zukofsky. I agree with the many on this list who've
said "well, start up your own movement, readings, presses", but problems
abound, as the history of this very list will show. How do you advertise
without getting lots of people who just want to be at the event to sneer
at post-structuralism and post-modernism and accuse you of not giving a damn
about race, sex, politics or indeed AIDS (thanks, Kevin, for your great
posting on this subject), and then won't listen when you say you've cared
about these things all along. The thing is, surely, that people, certainly
in this country, fall into avant-garde poetry, usually through liking someone's
style who's into it (and bell hooks may want to think of this as sexual,
but there's a buzz out of friendship, laughter, fun, too) - or, even, through
seeing, a la Platonism, the possibilities of perfect avant-garde poerty
through the flawed manifestation of the very well-read interesting lecher
who teaches the poetry course at college, or runs the local gallery, or
sells you software. That's the fact, on the ground-level, of how people get
into avant-garde poetry. Then there is a responsibility, before God if you
like, to educate and above all *free* that newcomer to become the best
avant-gardist they can be, not what you can channel them into. Of course,
I would prefer to go to the US and hang out with Juliana Spahr and Kevin
and Dodie and Gary Sullivan, but while I'm stuck in the UK on work commitments,
I experience what I'm describing, and get angry and want (reasonable) reforms.

So just a few marginalia:

Ron, I really like you defense of the experiences you've got, the places
you've read, by staying to your thing.

Ed, I loved what you said about Lacan; Poe seems a better judge of human
nature, and the subtleties of real detection work, than Lacan. But, Ed,
I hated your talk show crack against Andrew, it just seemed really
patronising because, Andrew, you made some great points.

I really liked everything, Colleen, you've been posting. I think this
generalising, sometimes waffling, offshoot discussion about power in general
has produced redeeming moments (I love the idea of writing poetry *as if*
it was powerful, it's why I think "talk show" idealising is great and vital)
but you, Colleen, and you, Gary, have continually brought us back to te
the very real power exercised that intimidates and sometimes abuses those
moving in these circles,

Ira

Subject:      Knowledge & empowerment (long)

Dear Joe:
     Thank you for that post; you're right about tone, and I think I've
been as bad as anyone else in that respect, maybe worse. I'll try to "tone
it down" as they say.
     When you're young &/or are new to something, you tend to have a lot
of illusions about things. Spencer doesn't sugar-coat anything, doesn't
deny his own standing, doesn't tell younger poets it's beneath the lofty
goal of "Poet" to want their work published.  (If he did tell us that,
it'd be like lecturing a bunch of kids at a busstop out his car window on
how much better it was for the environment, as well as for their
character, that they were taking public transportation.) He's not unique
in this respect, but he's rare enough. In my experience, he has been one
of few older poets who has consistently made time for me -- not to
mention every other younger poet (there are a lot of them) who shows up at
his door, or write him.
     I used to believe that if you knocked on doors long enough, you'd
eventually be let in. More often, I've found, the door is never answered.
No big deal, but to know that in advance -- and to have some understanding
of why this is the case -- may save the newbie a lot of unnecessary
heartache. It helps, I think, for younger publishers to know just what is
required to be carried by SPD, and I don't think it's beneath anyone
interested in poetry to want their new press carried by SPD. You have to
know someone there, and they have to like you. If you don't, or they
don't, you'll have to be publishing at least two perfectbound books a
year. (Their "written" policy.) Even that's no guarantee -- they have
limited shelf space, after all. A real guarantee would be to publish
someone of the standing of Susan Howe, Alice Notley, or Ron Silliman. I
don't know if Rochelle Owens is someone "of the standing" to guarantee SPD
access -- after all, Susan Smith Nash's Texture Press published a
"selected" of Owens' poetry, and I don't think that press has still
managed to get in through the door. (I think the people at SPD have to
either believe the books will sell, or one of them has to be a fan of at
least one of the people you're publishing, or you have to have someone on
your side like Charles Bernstein or Kathleen Fraser, someone with "pull"
there, talking them into taking you on; otherwise, don't get your hopes
up.)
     That's probably boring to most of us on this list -- or maybe even
inflammatory to some -- but potentially useful information for those
people who don't have it.
     Perhaps equally boring, equally inflammatory, but also equally
useful, is understanding how books get published in the U.S. The younger
poet can forget presses the size of Coffee House Press. I worked there for
a few months and their poetry list is filled until 1998, and there isn't
anyone included on that list you haven't heard of. Things won't change in
1998 -- when they'll be booked until 2002 with similar things.
     Like the lobbying that goes on on Capitol Hill, such a thing as
grant-lobbying in the U.S. exists. Because Charles Alexander was nice
enough to extend an invite to Marta and myself, we got to attend (more
observe) a dinner sponsored by the billionaire Cowles family and the
largest nonprofit literary organizations in Minnesota. Marta and my press,
Detour, was not represented; neither was Charles Alexander's Chax Press.
(Charles was there under the auspices of the Minnesota Center for Book
Arts, where he is Executive Director, and we were there as guests of the
MCBA. I don't know how Charles feels, but Marta & I felt that, had it not
been for Charles, we wouldn't have been allowed by these people to
"exist," at least not in that instance.) The dinner was for Gigi Bradford,
the Head or whatever of the NEA's Literature Program. The reason for this
dinner was two-fold: Gigi was there to both warn and "pump up" the various
nonprofits & their boards with respect to impending cuts. The
organizations were there, mostly, to ask that their funding not get cut,
that cuts be made w/respect to smaller organizations and individuals. (Or,
so I was told by Allan Kornblum, Coffee House's editor.)
     As funding dries up in this country, it will be individual
poets/writers and the smaller small presses who will lose most.  This has,
and will continue, to happen. Consequently, it is the emerging writers who
are, ultimately, cut off from funding. Younger poets and publishers, as
this happens, please try not to take too seriously people who tell you
it's beneath your calling as "Poet"  or "Poetry publisher" to be concerned
about this, if it indeed concerns you. (I've seen no similar chastising of
the NEA-watch material on this list -- which seems very odd to me. Why
single newbies out for tsk-tsking & you-should-be-above-that?)
     So. Most smaller presses won't be able to publish your work, either.
Potes & Poets has already closed its doors to younger writers; Peter
Ganick wants to be able to sell what books he does publish. Ed's Talisman
Books, unlike his _Talisman_ magazine, is similarly not open to younger
poets, and for the very same reason.  (Since Ed doesn't apply for grants,
he has to be more concerned about sales.) Neither Ed nor Peter, nor me for
that matter, can publish everything we like. We can't even publish *most*
of what we like. Consequently, it is more often than not the younger or
unestablished poets who lose out.
     Some poets learn that the surest way to get your book published is to
help pay for part or all of the production costs.  This is, I would
imagine, how at least 1/3rd to 1/2 of all poetry books in the U.S. get
published. I base that only on the kinds of cover letters I receive, and
from talking to various poets who have paid to have their books published,
and talking to various publishers who have accepted money from poets to
help pay for books. There is nothing wrong with this, and I don't bring it
up to make anyone feel bad. (I think the general stigma attached to self-
publishing is short-sighted.) It's information. Use it, those of you who
can.
     Well, there is something wrong with it, actually, though it isn't
anyone's fault. What happens, I think -- and this is why this discussion
is about much more than personalities -- what happens is that the poets
who do not have any money simply do not have any choice, here. This is an
issue that concerns me because if books = access to readers (& they, of
course, do) a socio-economic class in the U.S. is systematically being
underrepresented. I joke with friends about the proliferation of what I
call "homeowner-class"  poetry. It's a silly joke, it's a silly (not
terribly accurate) definition. But there are reasons why we see a lot of
certain kinds of writing, and not so much of a somewhat different kind of
writing. We don't see much of Daniel Davidson's writing, not in book form,
anyway, because he's on SSI/Medical Assistance, can't afford to "chip in"
for his next book; can't afford to make 100 copies of his own work, even
if he wanted to. (Dan was one of the last people to get a book published
through Zasterle before Manuel Brito began telling people he could no
longer afford to publish w/out author subsidy, a very lucky break for
Dan.) Dan happens to be someone who, because of his economic situation,
sees "class background" as "landscape." (There are people who don't.) Ira,
you and others on this list know that he's neither reductive nor soapboxy
about that, at least not in his poetry -- it's not merely a "poetry of
complaint." But, it does come out of a very different set of concerns, &
from a very different point-of-view, than the work of, say, Charles
Bernstein, or for that matter, Spencer Selby.  One of the reasons we don't
see much poetry like Dan's might be -- and this is just a guess made from
having considered how poetry books get printed in this country -- because
the people writing most of it simply do not have access to various presses
because they don't have, simply put, any money. Douglas Messerli's comment
in the intro to his Sun & Moon Anthology, that he "decided against"
poetry with more political/social concerns in favor of poetry more
concerned with issues of aesthetics and technique (to paraphrase),
reflects the current situation in the U.S., at least among "avant- garde"
or "experimental" or "exploratory" publishers, with this type of writing.
Now, obviously, very reductive political/social- concern writing will get
published, because it's a frequent "grant"  winner. Grant agencies love
that stuff, but it has to hit 'em over the head. Meaning, it can't be that
*and* aesthetically challenging, too. What the largest nonprofits give us
on this level is, to cite a recent example, Coffee House Press's _Atomic
Ghost_.  (Thumb through it; it's in stores.)
     As a reader, *I* am denied access to material like Dan's, except in
cases where I happen to know the poet, and can request a manuscript, or in
those very rare cases when their work does happen to get published. I'm
sure there's a lot else out there I haven't seen. I doubt I'll live to see
much of it, even though I make it my business to hunt it out. Kevin's
concern that there hasn't been any discussion of AIDS or HIV on this list,
Mark Nowak's and others' concerns that there has been little discussion of
nonwhite traditions, these are not merely complaints, but recognitions of
what (very easily) is allowed to slip through the cracks when people don't
concern themselves much with the WHY. That's my opinion, anyway.
     So, what happens? I think that by ignoring all of the above, one can
very easily fall into the illusion that what is being published is not
only "the best" or "most relevant" of what's being written today, but even
eventually believe that there isn't anything else out there. Certainly
most academics -- and you in academia have a better sense whether this is
true or not -- don't have or take the time to really do more than explore
what is readily available, already "talked up," almost always published,
"professionally," when making assessments of contemporary writing.  Some
do, but not most. Consequently, college students get a skewed idea of
what's being done today, what's *really* possible. I know, from having
gone to college, that I had, then, a really bogus sense of not only what
contemporary writing was, but even what it might be. (I don't have a
complete sense today, of course, but I have a much better sense.)
According to my college education, gay men & women didn't really exist,
were sort of overall unimportant, & the same was not only true of nonwhite
cultures & traditions, but of the lower classes as well. Pretty much only
straight, white, educated-class, mostly males, were -- so one would assume
from the types of books we were given to read -- the only people in the
world who put two or more thoughts together. That didn't "just happen." I
hear things are changing in colleges since I've been there; good.
     Joe, & others, I don't know if any of the info or opinions above will
prove useful to you. It's just one person's experience & opinions, after
all. I hope you and others do, and continue to, look beyond pre-existing
channels for new writing -- including (obviously) within yourselves.
     Knowledge & information is power. Everyone's entitled to it.  It's
not beneath you.
     Yours,
     Gary

Subject:      Jack Spicer

Perhaps one way into some issues around sex, privacy and also power, is
a few observations on Spicer. Ed has quoted him a few times, and Ron's
essay on him in the New Sentence was one utterly marvellous thing to thank
the limited publicity there is around Ron's name for; it certainly sent me
away to read Spicer for the first time (even though he was one of the few
interesting poets who had been on my university library shelves all along).
I adore Spicer's rhythm, and his mordant wit, and, actually, his Romanticism.
        Anyway, there was a short article on "San Fransisco Poetry" last year
in an academic periodical (I've spent my lunch hour trying to find it, but
I couldn't), which I remember reading; and it literally believed it was
dealing with the whole topic of its title, by quoting a famous incident
where Spicer read his poem "for Joe" at a public reading, and incensed
Denise Levertov (have I remembered this right, anyone?) with his line about
"the female genital organ is hideous", so that Levertov wrote a response
poem, which the article published, and for the reviewer that about wrapped
it up for San Fransisco, dumb town, end of story. The Spicer poem begins
with the hardly self-flattering language "People who don't like the smell
of faggot vomit / Will never understand why men don't like women". There
is such formality, like a syllogism, about this opening, a little Socratic
hint (since some men *do* like women) that Spicer is operating a ferocious/
ruthless speculation on an outrageous/offensive proposition; it seems
perfectly possible to reverse the terms and write "people who like the
female genital organ / will not agree"; it just doesn't seem a totalising
proposition "all people agree with me", but, precisely, anti-totalising.
        But that doesn't explain away the offensiveness, for the collaboration
with stereotypes of stigmatising the female body and encouraging/going alonf
g with violence against women. Certainly, there is mock violence against
fellow gay men, by using the word "faggot", and one could let Spicer have
argued that this thus makes the violence against women mock violence. But
as the article argued well, the way that Spicer read this poem, encouraging
the laughter of a predominantly gay male audience (but, Kevin Killian,
esteemed biographer of Spicer, please set me right if this is wrong), and
not noticing (or noticing and enjoying) the way this aggravated the discomfort
that the visitor Levertov was experiencing. This incident (unless the article
got it wrong) does bring up some themes for me. Was there a way, any way, for
Levertov to have entered into this moment, since the self-deprecating by
Spicer was offset by the clear solidarity in the room, and the misognyist
deprecating amplified by the room? Could she have found a poem to write that
would have mocked the room right back at them, and thus endeared all to all?
I'd really love anyone's ideas, and historical back-up, on this: are there
examples of female artists being able/allowed to tease such a circle and
maybe even sober them a little; or does one see instead outsiders, or a new
generation, of female and gay male writers co-founding a new circle, in
which such "fish" jokes are not the norm, and cannot be so comfortably made,
as in the Spicer anecdote.
        I raise all this because I also want to think about public and
private. I have had a lot of discussions with fellow bisexuals where, in
one case by a friend in front of her male partner, the person will offer
humour-intending caricatures of the bodies of a (usually the more socially
expected) gender they don't currently fancy, compared to the bodies of a
gender they currently do. In fact, using very similar terms to Spicer's
poem: as if there were, which there sometimes is, a slight pull towards
one gender which is so much accentuated by desire for conformity/easy life
that you need to counter it in order to give both genders a fair chance.
But then again there's plenty of people who categorically desire only one
gender; who, to quote the great Craig Owens (also lost to AIDS), take
great offense at being told, a la Freud, that homophobia is an expression
always of repressed homosexual desire, as if the common experience wasn't
in fact unphobic, unheldback, unabashed homosexual desire.
        To explain then: I guiltily, and harmlessly I think, enjoy this
private attempts at humour by unfair caricature; but I hate all the public
exclusions at readings and in workplaces etc. I think of Spicer as private
to me, because so few read him here, and because I discovered him through
Language Poetry, which seems hidden and private in British poetry culture
(also, of course, caricatured and found hideous by those who don't like
the smell of it, to allude back to the Spicer poem). I almost want Spicer
to stay private, not often read (or as Ron says in his essay, appropriated
by many who don't seem to actually enjoy his words/poetic at all, so I have
a kind of private "genuine" worship as compared to mere fans).

        I think all these things need more spelling out. I'm partly writing
this in order to respond, Ed, to your justifiable "if this is a heterosexual
space then I'm a talking mule" one-liner. As I said to Kevin before, I
try not to catch up things I don't want to say in my rhetoric; what I and
Gary have been saying is not essential (part of the DNA) of either age
or heterosexuality, and I'd prefer, if it weren't so eyecatching, to talk
about power not terms like "heterosexual space". But, then again, as soon
as we've all started talking just about "power", we're no longer talking
about abusive and excluding unethical behaviour by poets and circles, which
was the topic I used my eyecatching language to bring up, and at least it
*got* a little brought up that way, which it isn't doing talking about
power per se. It remains the case that only parts of poetic culture talk
about sex in detail and with scrutiny of issues of power of the sorts Gary
and Colleen and I have been raising; and Mirage Periodical, a gay and lesbian
periodical, tends to go for the detail and scrutiny I want, in the ways I've
described. I realize you're a very busy and valuably productive man, Ed,
as Gary has been saying, but I'd love to see you write something long taking
on some of these points more; I think I know, like my reading of Spicer,
how to take your wit and not assume you're Clarence Thomas; but, in this#
context, it feels un-nerving, rather than thought-provoking (although I've
let this effort at least be provoked),

In-Reply-To:  <9504111425.AB18541@isc.sjsu.edu>

OK, so my pun was worse than Ron's;  My ref. to putting the "subject" to
bed was meant to be a bad joke in response to Tom's response to Spencer's
response to Ron, etc.  As my earlier posts indicate, I do not in fact
believe there's much, if any, point in trying to tell people they
shouldn't care about the issues Spencer and others have raised.  My last
(not in the sense of terminal, I trust) post was intended to underscore
what others have said about those with some modicum of power desiring to
change the subject when that form of power is under discussion.  As
someone who is "tenured" in the usual sense, it would be stupid of me to
pretend this makes no difference to the way that I participate in the
discussion.  Indeed, one of the benefits of tenure is that I am now much
more vocal in my opposition to the exploitation of nontenured faculty
than I was when I had to worry about my opposition possibly endangering
my own job (a form of cowardice probably familiar to many).

In my messages this past week, I've been trying to register a mild
irritation at the use of the academic metaphor in this context.  Ron, of
course, is not tenured anywhere and was right to point out that fact.  On
the other hand, those of us who have never had a perfect-bound book of
poems published by any press may find the remarks about never being
published twice in succession by the same press to be something of an
evasion.

Spencer is clearly right about one thing; having a "name" opens doors,
though they may not be the most inviting doors to pass through.  I've
told my students for years that the single best way to get your work
published (other than going through an MFA program & joining the tenured)
is to become a publisher.  This fact, once known, will cause other
editors to read your work more closely than they had before.  I know of
at least ten poets who have attested to this phenomenon.

As someone who has published books of criticism, I am now able to get a
hearing at academic presses.  However, that carries no weight whatsoever
with poetry publishers.  Likewise, though I'm tenured and published, I
work at one of the last universities in the country that still has a four
course per semester teaching load, and have only once in my career been
invited to speak at a conference.  As someone once remarked to me,
teaching at a "non-research" university means that you don't exist for
those in the more prestigious colleges.  This is not entirely true, but
it feels true to most of my colleagues.  This parallels the situation we
see in the past week's discussion in an odd way.  My friends in the UC
system don't like to think that they have any power; my friends in the
CSU system think the UC people have all the power.

I'm wandering, but here's the point I want to get to.  When Foucault says
that power is everywhere, he does not seem to imply that power is always
and everywhere the same.  We all have power, and we are all subjected
to/by power.  Our analyses should be directed toward specific
descriptions of the forms of power we exercise and experience, and how
they can be altered.  That discussion is the one I'd rather be having, as
opposed to a back and forth about whether or not poet X or poet Y is more
powerful/publishable/willing to acknowledge power.

I'll try to get back with something more coherent when I'm not running to
class.

     I am interested in the sexing of poetry. Remember that WIttig says that
language is gender neutral, but immediately says that to say that is
relatively meaningless because we are gendered and thus gender everything
else.
I am interested in this proccess of gendering, and how it is essentially
about
fictions, it seems to me. This I think has enormous implications for how we
read and how we write. Implications that have not been explored in poetry.
     Thanks, Eric.


Gendering of langauge, especially english isn't totally visible when you
right from a male view point.  We have been trained to accept the first
person male narrative as the norm.  POst modernism is breaking this down
but the gender bias is still there.
        Eventhough English is supposively a neuter langauge the Proto
Indo European roots of its nature are not.  The gender difference has
been ingrained.  I find it most obvious in cultural distinction of what
are considered male dialogue words and accepted words for female female
conversation.  Similar occurrances appear in poetry as the reader tries
to identify voice.  Words are accepted when used by one sex, but taken in
offense when use by the other. i find this intriguiging if langauge is to be
nuetral.
        I have to go but I have  more to say,

not all want to kill their father
half as much as I do,
roseanne arnold effaces freud

around a small pantheon of names

a long poem.

1.

How far did we travel?
Till heart dried up.
Where did we start from?
A plan.
Where are we now?
Morningside. Aix. Mona.
What can words do that we haven't done?
Make a place. Then we can stop.
What is this place, if not a place to stop?
The yard is a loom; we begin with it.
To return? To begin again?
The model makes room for a setting out.
Why did we set out?
To get to a dialect.
Will there be one?
We know, after going through it, that there is.
Who else comes with us?
The yard is common: slave, poet, black.
And things? Do things go with us?
Bowl, fountain, vase, bird call, mirror, pigeon, cello, gravel, bed.
How did we choose what to take?
The yard gave them when we set out.
And people?
There are two of us on the trip.
Who is the slave?
A poet.
Who is the poet?
A black.
Who is the black?

The building I stay in, for example, invents its eastern face and wes=

Brisk travel to approximate a scurrilous text

Time expressed visually as numerous available routes

aldon, your point about foucault hits home with me... for years i've been
(in my occasionally angry way) trying to get folks to see that issues of
class (and academe is real good at avoiding or obscuring honest talk about
this subject) have not necessarily to do with how little money one has in
one's bank account, but with how much and what sorts of access one is granted
in institutional terms... i know a number of grad. students (i was one too)
who seem to think that privation toward a phud constitutes a class distinction..... but what i learned growing up for a good portion of my life on the wrong
side of the tracks is that theres a number of things that go along with lower
economic status that, though emerging from a lack of the almighty buck, have
in fact to do with entry into a specific social sector (or inability to enter),
with an emotionally damaging sense of alienation, with wholesale exclusion
from entire networks of taste (what's perceived as good in normative terms)
AS WELL AS, say, health care... which leads to an impoverishment of aspiration
AS WELL AS an empty stomach, neither of which is offered to one as a choice...

looking forward to your further thoughts///

Hi Ira,

well it had lit nit picking salon toadied all over it.
The CCCP charity ball for poverty fond raising versers the rest. That's
also the pervasive cynicism of London and of Cambridge over the past few
years. One reason for my 'getting out'.

That game simply isn't worth the bothering. If it patently wasn't true in
my case I'd say "I've been to the top and there's nothing there!".

Somehow something of what I'm saying is pertinent to this discussion of
power and politics in poetry circles. The front game is a lit career game
if you look carefully. Simply refuse to play. That doesn't in any way
excuse those who abuse such situations. But don't give credence to the
fawning crap shoot and confer or confirm power by even giving your
attentive presence. Let the inflated egos blow away on their own copious
and stale hot air. Pastiche and parody of now is the festering pits.

Subject:      my correspondence with Spencer, and the power of poets

Well, by referring to you as Spencer Selby in my post, Spencer,
I didn't mean to turn my back on our relationship but rather
to indicate exactly with whom I'd had the correspondence. I
greatly enjoy my friendship with you. Your intransigence
(what you refer to as my inability to get you to agree with
me) is one of the attractions of the friendship, not a negative
at all. "Opposition is true friendship" (for $50 and a chance
at the weekend cruise, identify that quotation).

I think my calling your position nominalist is fair as well; again
I don't mean to reduce it in any way. Nor, really, do I think I
said that you are wrong. It's hard to crack the crowd as a newcomer
in poetry as in most other such little worlds. Further, it's hard
to have shifts in your position accepted or appreciated as you
go along in your career - a related matter which you don't treat.
Many are those who, comfortable with the poet of _EncY_ - my
first book - are a good deal less comfortable with the one who
wrote _Letters of the Law_ my most recent. A personal example
but hardly an exclusive one. The world trades on recognizability,
it's not surprising.

When I say that the authority of writing as an activity is what
matters, I sure don't mean it's all that matters to editors or
even to readers. It's to writers that it's all that ought to
matter. In any case, if we understand anything from a century
of philosophical analysis whose sole aim sometimes seems to
show it, it is that "matters" only parses as "matters to X."
Intentionality is of the essence of mind.

Thus, when I say that the issue of power as you raise it
bores me, I mean just that. Not at all to make it more
difficult to "solve" this "problem," but to recognize that
it won't be "solved" because it is not a "problem" but a
condition. In a way I like it. I like the agon, and I like
knowing that I can turn away from the agon. Often, I find,
I am satisified with the difficulty of life. I don't wish
for a world in which the minute you wrote something
wonderful, huzzahs wd rise from all corners - a universal
egalitarian response to new and anonymous brilliance
(altho there is no greater pleasure I don't think than
to experience the same: the first time I heard Lee Ann
Brown's writing or Melanie Nielsen's or Jessica Grim's,
for example).

What about the value of struggle, anybody have a yen for
that? I do decidedly.

Finally, I well remember the first time I ran a reading
series; it was with Ron Silliman, at the Grand Piano in
SF in 1977. Immediately, people began bugging us to give
them readings, and we did put a lot of people on (two a
week for a long time). At the same time, we commanded no
authority whatever, who were we? We just had a coffee
house space. Anyone else cd have had a coffee house
space too, and put on readings. Yet, we were treated as
if we possessed some power and territory, and folks
wanted a peace of it.

The theory of poetic space behind this is that of a closed
and finite space with operators in place; that's your
theory too, I conclude, Spencer. But I think poetic
space is like an extensible puzzle. It exists and has
a set of features at its edges, and you hew something
new to extend that space while relating to it. At the
same time, you create a new space for that space to
occupy too. You, for example, started Sink magazine.
You will remember that my first advice to you when
you showed me issue one, was that you should publish
new writers, rather than making a new venue for all
of us. I don't think I am convictable on your charges,
in other words. It's boring to talk about the
problems of breaking in or of making something genuinely
new, but not boring to do so, nor boring to call it
out when you see it and to publish it.

"As politics (which involves the communication of only power relationships

reductive modes of relating, with it buried, politics becomes more and more

mean-spirited, if indeed spirit of any kind can be said to be involved."

Without exactly agreeing with the "terms" of this statement (terms
which in a sense dictate its conclusions), I am all the same in
sympathy with it. But, to me, it is precisely this concern with
who is getting published or famous and why who has what power where,
this it is which is "mean-spirited," that's why I said I found it
boring and wished it would go away (a statement hardly
synonymous, btw, with an "impulse to suppress it" - and this last
remark is aimed at Joe Amato too).

In reference to Lightman's almost wishing that Spicer were still
almost unknown in various places, etc. Well, we should remember and
take seriously Spicer's sense of writing for a community largely in
the Bay Area (though later we would see that there were more copies
of the +Collected Books_ sold in Vancouver than anywjhere else). That
he couldnt care less whether there were any copies sold and bought in
New York or Philadelphia. One should remember something of that while
reading the poems; it gives them some of their force. The intimate
urge of the voice, the confidence in the Spicer SENTENCE in those
poems. What Jack thought about the fate of the poems these 30 years
later, I dont know. But his sense of still writing TO people he knew
is part of what makes the poems so damned wonderfulo.

I imagine there are a lot of people on this list who have jazz/poetry
tapes of their own work. It may be with local (various localities) &
regional & lesser-known national performers, but I imagine lots of us
have done various kinds of collaborations. I know I have, with Steve
Nelson-Raney and with Thomas Gaudynski, with Chuck Koesters & Carlos
Nakai, and others (not all jazz, but some); I know Sheila Murphy has
collaborated with various performers. I'd be interested to know how much
this is a living part of various people's work, and particularly how such
work informs the ear, the sounding, of poets.

        thanks,

"     Joe, & others, I don't know if any of the info or opinions above will
prove useful to you. It's just one person's experience & opinions, after

is an extraordinary and useful characterization of real struggle and
real condition in a social world I recognize and recognize myself
co-inhabiting with him, and with others - "others" to include
Spencer Selby and to include Ron Silliman. Every poetic act is,
I hope an oppositional act of witness, a realist act. The most
minimal act of extension, of giving your work to someone to read,
is the first and best act of publishing. The problem of samizdat
in the Soviet Union, for example, was not that poets couldn't find
publishers because publishers were prevented (by active and
passive means) from publishing these poets, but of a world
organized to erase that oppositional witness, the acts of poets
and, if I may oldfashiondlly so characterize it, of the poetic
soul. The soul that believes that expression changes the world.
There is no doubt that the veryb best way to see the struggle
to get young or unknown or changing poets published is to see
that struggle as against this closing of the world. To that
degree, in that sense, to that end, I concur. Only this is
not an issue of which poet has power and which does not; that
is, it is a realer issue than that.

Gary, your long post on knowledge & empowerment is most welcome. You're
probably right about the presence at the Cowles dinner for Gigi Bradford.
Chax or Detour would  not have been invited because they don't have the
right community presence, boards with clout of various kinds, etc. At
more recent meetings of the six largest literary organizations in Twin
Cities I have been lobbying to include other (not the largest)
organizations, and it looks like that will happen in September, but I had
to argue against the idea that the larger organizations ought to set the
agenda first and then open the floor to smaller organizations. Makes me
wonder if I ought to be lobbying for more openness or if I ought to just
be running for the door as fast as I can.

I'm not so certain about the effect of cutting NEA. Sometimes I think the
larger presses with more money from NEA will be hurt more than the
smallest presses who will find ways to survive without such money, as
they find ways now to survive without such money. But these are complex
matters, as de-funding NEA, if that happens or if drastic cuts happen,
will have ripples and waves throughout the philanthropic world.

I think your post should be read by Gigi Bradford
at the NEA. I can probably find that e-mail address for you if you want it.

        all best,
        charles

Everyone is getting so touchy lately and I'm not quite sure what t o think
of it.  Spring in the Northern hemisphere is obviously  putting us all
in a tizzy.  I like it, I think we all need a good bout of defensive
cynicism.

In reply to Blair's rant and have to somewhat agree just jumping of a
bridge would make things simpler, but then what would the after life be
like with all those quitters.  It all comes down to guilt, which is
bloody well boring and I don't think we need to play the apology game any
more.  The PC movement has shown us all what a nightmare that can be.
It's just another form of generic classification that by breaking down
one stereo type and constructing another that masks as unoffensive.  This
fabricated NewSpeak is a false liberation.  Not that I want to preach,
but i don't fear those who offend me  but those who seek to shield me
from vulgarity.

And to Eric, sorry (fuck me I didn't want to apologize, I recant) if I
crossed genres but the way I view myself is a writer, not an author, not
a poet.  i look at all forms of writing for incite.  Most of my favorite
poets I admire for their ability to tell story. likewise I admire
novelist who use their poetic license

There's still little of Taylor's poetry in print, a few as liner notes
and a large chunk in Nate Mackey & Art Lange's <Moment's Notice> are all
I can recall offhand.  But there is a _very_ good recording of Taylor's
poetry on Leo, originally an lp and now, I'm pretty sure, available on
CD.  It's called <Chinampas> and it's just Taylor reciting and playing
(mostly percussion instruments).

Less jazz-related but mostly not chamber music either are these other new
music/new writing collaborations: Morton Feldman's <Three Voices> - an
hour-long piece using about two and a half lines of Frank O'Hara in the
midst of mostly vocalise; Feldman's opera <Neither> on a text written for
him by Samuel Beckett; I've heard a tape of Steve Benson improvising with
the Splatter Trio (did they really collaborate with Nate Mackey?); The Hub
(an interactive live computer music group) performed <Hub Renga> live on a
Pacifica station in the Bay area with poets sending in texts digitally via
the Well (a bit of this is on the second Hub CD);  Larry Polansky
collaborated with Australian poet Chris Mann on a piece called <Simple
Actions/Rules of Compossibility>; and, I haven't heard it but Nicolas
Collins used some texts of Diane Ward's that were subsequently published
in <Writing> for a composition or installation or something.

poetry may not have anything to do with Politics (though that's
debatable), but it sure as hell has it's _own_ politics, which is what
this thread has been all about.  The fact that the thread has run as long
as it has is a sign that there are indeed politics right here on this

I share Charles Alexander's interest in hearing about other people's
collaborations involving words and music.  Just this past week, I
collaborated in a performance of my poems performed as a sonata (that is,
equal voicing, rather than accompanied) with Megha Morganfield, gifted
performer on Celtic harp.  We've now been working together for two years,
following a program we gave at a gallery here in Phoenix.  We did a cassette
tape called "The Weight and Feel of Harps" a while back, and it's been well
received.  (Can be ordered through me if anyone is interested)

The tone matching we magically discovered between the instrument and my
speaking voice has proved a catalyst for making certain types of work
together.  We're considering at present a collaborative composition relating
to particular types of landscape within Arizona..
In performance, the harp sound (plucky rather than swishing, so more
lutelike) pacifies and stimulates the senses in an audience, so people seem
better prepared to receive the words.  It's a lovely phenomenon that I'd
prefer not to consider negatively, as I'm grateful for any entry point at
all.  It's been exciting for me, rewarding on that front.

Most of all, the seemingly infinite capacity for variation that Megha
possesses (as a trained flutist, I know what to look for, and I LOVE what she
does) helps me want to do more in the written work.  It brings out a
particular attunement to the geography here.  (Mostly a point of personal
association)

I consider collaboration of any kind one of the most enriching experiences of
my life.  This, of course, includes the constant collaborating that I do with
John Bennett through the mails (and I'm not even close to the only one--many
on this list work with him, too).  I know I've referenced this before.

Thanks for bringing this up, Charles.

Gary, you put this really well in your post about empowerment.  I recognize
that in the relatively more limited sphere involving publication of
innovative work, the struggles and the processes are blurred.  You cut
through this and get to the heart of the matter.  Some of the points you make
are easier to see in the large press world, which is not to say we're
uninfected within this one (by the limitations that hurt everyone).  For some
time, I've been struck by what's in airport bookshops.  People who don't take
pains to go looking for good books (probably most people) have access to this
tiny little row of tiny-minded little books that seem to me barely
recreational, and miles from good (the gospel according to SEM).  So they buy
what's there (if they buy a book at all) and in many cases, I am told, don't
really read them, just carry them around, whatever.  Whatever they do with
the books is really not my concern.  But the limitations, the measley little
rows we see and see and see in airports (I tend to buy a legal pad if I find
myself without a stash of stuff to read), is a self-perpetuating phenomenon.


And it all comes from tacit consent.  Not speaking up ultimately yields this
kind of limitation.

I raise this common sense, less intellectually-oriented example if only to
underscore the direction that this process takes, using one scabby little
example.  For the record.

The exchanges on (of?) poetry & power are really
interesting.

I'd be very interested to see a concurrent discussion
get going on the compensations involved in our

For such a politically disempowered group to be so
beset with issues of power, there have got to be
pretty decent compensations, the 'pleasures'.

Is this vehicle designed to please?

Subject:      Death of Andy Cole

Have received word, from Nemi Frost and Larry Kearney, of the death earlier
this year in Marin County (Northern California) of Andy Cole, aged 52.
When he arrived in San Francisco in 1964 from Binghampton and Brooklyn,
Andy Cole was 21.  He and his friends were promptly dubbed the "Jesuits" by
Jack Spicer and his circle at Gino & Carlo's, the North Beach bar/site of
the poetic activity surrounding "Open Space" and Spicer's penultimate book
"Language."  In "Language" these Brooklyn Catholic boys flicker in and out
of vision, flames casting shadows, forever young, scared, near death,
untouchable.  Like his great friends Spicer and Richard Brautigan, Andy
Cole died "essentially of alcoholism." (LK)

Of some dark forest where we wander amazed at the selves of ourselves.
Stumbling.  Roots
Stay.  You cannot lose your innocence, Andy
Nor could Alice.  Nor could anyone
Given the right woods"

Dear Cris and Ira,
         It's not worth the carriage, is it? But it is interesting
that it can carry the prestige still in Britain.  I don't know if
this particular phenomenon happens elsewhere. I relish the recording
of what is not the true scene it believes it is.  However much it
happens it is not something to be angry about.  I'm sure you're
right, Cris, walk away from it, Ira, but quickly.  It's a bit like the Royal
Academy, never too far from fox-hunting in the past (and the
present?), the establishment's version of culture.

Thanks for the Spice of Spicer's commentary on what, in retrospect
even on a day approaching May, seems Ginsberg's silly identity politics
of flowers and fantasy.
Just a note, I took it that the comment about books at airports also
had a larger application.  If "privatizing" airports, along with all
the other things on the Tory lists yields a book on Stein for
a transatlantic flight, has the world improved or poetry become (less)
political?   Problem, or part of it, is that no one can get outside
the transnational flow, net, order of capital.  It might be that,
like the trogs on the bridge in Gibson's novel *Virtual Light* one
can engage in the trade of unnoticed beauties and unadopted changes,
but Ecco, Stein, and Gibson are surely pocketed in that net.  Politics,
in any case, happens at various levels and in many places.  AND,as
Spicer's manifold irony echoes, "People are starving"--

how poets who have found their 'voice' are presumed to continue to articulate

is generally viewed with some suspicion... it seems to me this is the case
both within more avant garde circles and within the more orthodox poetry

Yay! we're on Spicer again!  First, kudos to Edward Foster for
his monograph on Spicer and Ron Silliman for both the New Sentence
article and his piece in Perelman's *Writing/Talks*.

If we are going to talk about power and analogize it to shit,
Spicer had much to say on the subject:
                For you I would build a whole new universe around myself.
                        This isn't shit it is poetry. Shit
                Enters into it only as an image.

Dear Kenneth:

In response to your post about SPD, I think it would be helpful for those
without SPD access to note that, if Detour wasn't carried by them, we
wouldn't have been able to afford to publish Johanna Drucker's _Dark
Decade_. 1/2 the money for that book we made by typesetting the
soon-to-appear next issue of _Central Park_; 1/4th of the money we made
pre-selling books through the mail to Johanna's fans (mostly people
interested in "book art" items); and 1/4th of the money was from sales of
previous of our books carried by SPD. As neither Marta nor I work
full-time, we can't pay for the things ourselves, and do rely on sales to
be able to continue publishing. You're right -- we too have boxes of
books here in our closets -- but equally true is that our own access to
SPD has allowed us to continue publishing. They're not Consortium (who
agressively sell many, many books for small/literary publishers), but
they do keep some of us in business. Our press, anyway.

Yours,

Gary

Dear Charles:

I'm glad you've been lobbying for everyone; you weren't here prior to
working at the MCBA, but you should know that before you started
work there, it was a very different, much more closed, organization. My
friend Michael Kronebusch said that the event you curated (I think it was
"The Boundless Book") was the first time that bookmakers from out of the
upper midwest region had been invited there, would have been unheard of
prior to your getting there. So, many thanks from all of us here.

Feel free Charles (or anyone) to forward that post to Gigi. I deleted it to
keep my e-mail file more manageable.

As far as the NEA cutbacks hurting larger organizations more, I
understand your logic. It's like this cartoon I just saw: A cat in a suit
standing in front of a desk, behind which sits a dog in a suit. The dog
says to the cat: "I'm not worried about you, Henley. You'll land on your
feet."

More to say about & around that, mostly things I want to post from Jack
Smith's book, _Historical Treasures_. More about that (& Jack Smith)
later this evening or tomorrow.

Yours,

Edward, But I would contend that these "texts" _will_ be able to be read
years hence. Electronic poetry magazines and books are archived at the
Electronic Poetry Center; the transactions of this list are also
archived (and, indeed, can also be keyword searched). So that the
material is _there_. In fact, one might argue that it will be _more_
possible to read an early issue of RIF/T or diu or TREE years hence
than it is for many people unable to track down c or caterpillar...

I recently changed my relationship to poetics server by subscribing in
Digest mode because I couldn't keep up with all the messages. And it is a
shock to me how much my feelings about the listserv have changed:

I am no longer following the arguments. I often delete the entire
message. When I read the message, the individual messages don't stand out
as they used to. The sense of community seems to have been fostered by
the volume in individual messages. I still get from one to five personal
messages a day and value them immensely, but the listserv seems not to be
a community in "Digest mode". It is the other who is not me.

Maybe I am alone in this, but I wonder if anyone else has similar or
different responses to the new mode. Can "Digest" really digest the
material and does that mean it re-morphs the material into an
indistinguishable mass of components?

James,

The "digest" mode repackages the list events in an arbitrary "order."
I think your sense that there is less vitality is a fair call. This is
a machine sense of increment, 24 hours or whatever it is, when from a
human point of view some exchanges expire within hours (some of the
volleys, perhaps) or luxuriate across days sometimes naturally
spreading into related and maybe even more interesting stretches of
conversation (e.g., jazz and poetry).

"Digest," coming from any usual sense of the word, is not accurate, of
course, because there is no summation or other thoughtful order made;
only a lump sum of the day's events.

The other side is to be somewhat chained to the sometimes rapid-fire
onslaught of messages that can accumulate like snow (metaphor at least
applies to certain of our climates). I also enjoy, however, the sense
of _pace_. E.g., sometimes around midnight the messages come in one
after another; at other times there are long stretches where everyone
must be reading or have attention wandering elsewhere.

So neither option is ideal. It is the immediacy of postings that I
find most interesting, though, so I opt for the message by message
version of the exchange, as I have responded to this instantly as it
came across my screen...

opportunities for self-difference, but certainly the best-known
poets of the past maintained distinctive voices (as obvious as
Dickinson, Whitman, eg).  & human nature: we want to know what
to expect; & we think that those who are touched by the fire
will know always how to speak, so that if they change their
manner they must not be sure that what they did before was
'right', & if they don't know how to decide to speak then how
can we know how to decide to listen?  self-difference is
interesting, but it is not comfortable, & it is not the
language of certainty.

i do not want to write different poems in the same ways, but i
understand that readers -- myself reading others, too -- have a
hard time with the anti-expected in the historically
single-voiced realm of poetry.

but, like you, i write different poems in different ways,
regardless.

I've set up a poetry reading for Ted Enslin and John Taggart to take place
here in Charlottesville on Monday April 17th at 8 p.m. (in Minor Hall, room
125, on the grounds of the University of Virginia).  I know there are
several people on the list who are interested in attending; my apologies to
the rest of you for the extra scrolling...

If anyone needs directions or further details you can contact me at

Ira,
Cris has given me this oppurtunity to reply to your--sadly, quite
accurate--piece about the recent "poetry party" in London. Your description
of the evening as "a meeting of the two rival camps in avant-garde poetry"
is every bit as distasteful as the--yes, pathetic--parodies of Language
poetry which were read by one of the Cambridge poets (Peter Riley, pop
pickers!). Perhaps a bit of background information may be useful here: the
evening was a party (with readings) to raise money for the Cambridge
Conference of Contemporary Poetry, an annual event which has received less
Arts Council funding this year. (To their credit, the organisers do put on
people from outside either the London or Cambridge "schools"--Barbara
Guest, Ann Portugal, Steve Benson, for example.)
    You correctly state that there were ten readers at the party. You also
correctly state that eight of these readers were men, and two of them
women. What you disingenuously neglect to mention is that you were one of
the eight men (and you also fail to categorise your work as being either
second-hand Zukofsky or second-hand Prynne, the two options which seem to
be available depending on one's choice of geographical affiliation). I feel
that the fact that you chose to travel to London (poems safely in your bag)
and participate in the reading--with the rest of "us"--denies you access to
the morally superior tone you adopt in your role as correspondent and
critic of the UK "scene", such as it is. But anyway, this is by the by.
    More important than the above is your correct identification of the
"stifling dominant maleness" that pervades readings in London. And, yes,
you're right, there was no attempt made to engage or involve the small
number of women--yes, mostly friends of readers, including me--who'd come.
Most of my friends have stopped coming to readings now, as they're not made
welcome--it's amazing to see just how many heads turn when someone "new"
walks into a reading--a mistake, surely? what are THEY doing here? So, OK.
Let's pretend that one of the regulars does make an effort to engage one of
the neophytes in conversation. Here's how it might go: "Do you write
poetry?" "No." "Oh." If the neophyte is lucky, "conversation" stops here,
but here's a possible reply, once the neophyte's non-poetry-writer status
has been confirmed: "Actually, no one here really likes my work..."
Sometimes--although this happens rarely--a neutral, but serious, ground for
conversation is discovered. This is usually jazz. Although London poetry,
in particular, is an almost exclusively male domain, it is also closed off
to interference, to noise from outside, on a scale that extends far beyond
issues of gender. (So it seems to me, as a London resident for three
years.) There are also many instances of hostility toward poetry from the
"outside"--especially the U.S. (I know that you know this, Ira, I just
mention it as a general point.) (Oh, last year I heard an American
poet--female--preface a poem with "This one's for all you pregnant mothers
out there." The audience was exclusively male.)
    Finally, on the subject of Friday's party, I'd just like to say that
there was a reading, it was in London, I was asked to read at it, and I
read. If this identifies me as a member of the "London school" then I am
deeply saddened. Surely one can live in London because there are lots of
cinemas, restaurants, etc., and not because one finds Prynne's work "ugly"
and "cluttered" (just two of the criticisms I've heard since living here).
(Incidentally, after more than two years of living in London, the first
complimentary words about Prynne I heard came from an American on holiday,
Peter Gizzi!)
    I'm appealing to you, Ira, because, apart from anything else, we share
a common interest in poets who live beyond these shores. The shallow
typifications and vapid generalisations in your piece can only make matters
worse, and, as you know, they're quite bad enough as it is.

When I got home tonight & read the mail I found that my "hello" had
apparently gotten lost in the aether.  Sorry if I seemed to be barging in
with the other day's postings.

I'm probably an oddity on the list.  I've been a reader of new poetry in
whatever you want to call the area this list is about forever, but I'm
not a poet or an academic.  I'm that general reader that likes to read
new work.  I probably should have written "one of those general
readers," 'cause we are out here, you know.

Anyway, I'm also an oddity in being from Seattle, the only person I've
noticed from the Pacific Northwest (though I've obviously noted several
people posting from Canada's "Southwest").

I've spent a lot of the past twenty years presenting new music concerts,
doing radio, and generally working in the non-profit arts world.

And I'll probably remember more examples of new music/new writing
collaborations every time I post.  Today I thought of the ongoing, though
often low-key, collaboration between composer Alvin Curran and Clark
Coolidge, who have known each other since they were kids in Rhode
Island.  And there are a couple of song settings of Charles Olson texts
by Pauline Oliveros that I've seen listed, but I've never heard.

Oh yeah, that Diane Ward collaboration was with David Weinstein, not
Nicolas Collins.

Now I'll go read that long list of mail.

Subject:      Jack Smith

     The following excerpts are from _Historical Treasures_, a collection
of essays and pieces by Jack Smith, published by Hanuman in 1990, a year
after the performance-artist/filmmaker died of AIDS. Never having seen
Smith perform, nor his movie _Flaming Creatures_, I can't really say
anything about his creative work (though a friend recently gave me some
wonderful second-hand accounts of it); but, after reading my daily mail
from poeticslist, I found this book in a store, and was surprised by
the amount of overlay.
     Smith seems to have made very few compromises. His work -- which he
ultimately considered to be "baroque" -- took, by his own account,
enormous effort to create; though, he didn't take equal pains to preserve
it. From J. Hoberman's Introduction: "Once [Smith] withdrew _Flaming
Creatures_ from Anthology Film Archives, his art was untainted by any
institutional endorsement -- an astonishing fact in this cruddy age ..."

     From Smith's essay, "Remarks on Art and the Theater":

     "It's the only American response to real art: they become criminal.
They don't think about supporting it. Instead they'll give you a hard time
that they won't give to somebody making schlock. You know, they just threw
money at Andy Warhol because he conformed exactly to what Americans want.
You see. I don't think any of you realize sufficiently what you're up
against. These people, the foundations, the curators, they're not there to
help you; they are there to feed you into the commercial industry.  That's
what's being pushed in the schools: Vampirism. Art is not being taught in
the schools, how to make it. The way it's being taught, some really
powerful personage or work with a lot of essence is being dangled in front
of them. Then they're fertilized by this, the myth of being really
fertilized. And then they can make art. This is fraudulent. It saves them
a lot of time by not teaching what ought to be going on. They're not
showing you, molecule by molecule, how to make art. They're substituting
the system by exposing them to some artist, and the more soaked in tragedy
and failure that person is whose art they're dangling in front of you, the
better, because then it increases the thrill of vampirism. ... And they
still can't make art, and they don't want to face the fact they're going
to have to become an apprentice.  They paid a lot of money not to know
that. ...
     "About a year and a half ago I just suddenly realized I had all this
work to squeeze out, and the theater wasn't going to pay me. I said to
them: 'You have to pay me a good amount of money. I'm not going to stand
on this stage in front of all those healthy yuppies, all of them with
teeth, and I have to entertain them, and I'm the only one in the room
without teeth.' I said, 'You've got to pay me two thousand dollars.' And
that is not much. ... He couldn't do it because he had this image of the
crazy baby poopoo who lays the golden egg, and you don't have to pay them
and you can save a nickel on them.
     "In this country we still don't know what we're up against.  There's
a profound hatred of art, and that's where all these troubles are coming
from. Everyone believes they adore art, that they want to support it,
throwing money at it and so forth. But if it is real art they cannot help
it; it must get mutilated. ...
     "European art teachers never came here. Why on earth should they?
They'd have to be insane to leave a cultural paradise and come here.
European artists did work that Americans were very pleased to think was
American art. It wasn't. It was one-hundred percent European. Americans
never made art. The aesthetic part of something is ultimately the most
functional part. Manufacturing and making art are two opposite ways of
thinking. They don't agree at any point. Have you ever driven through the
German countryside?  It's art. There are rows of crops in stripes, winding
gently around the curves of the hills. In stripes! You've got to have an
aesthetic sense, which the Germans are usually not credited for.  They're
making art when they don't know it, because they want strength: they want
something that's going to last. That's art.  Farming is very close to
making art. It's much closer than a lot of other things. We don't have
that. We want to get rid of it, stamp it out, rape it. Just like we have
raped this country. You can't indulge in behavior like that and say it
isn't hatred. And I've lived through it, too. I was knocking myself out to
make this stuff. And I always assumed that people would see this and have
pity on me and give me at least the support of not stealing from me. They
didn't."

                                * * *

     I feel bad excerpting -- like taking fertile soil from a perfectly
beautiful patch of earth & using it to pot houseplants -- but thought the
above might add to, expand & expose the underbellies of some of the posts
I've been reading (especially Tom Mandel's recent one on "the general
condition," much of which I agreed with) as well as posting.

Perfect bound, the market commodity, easily digestible, commonplace. Oh,
the history of the book is groaning. A thousand years ago it was carvings
on stone or clay, six or seven hundred years ago it was illuminations and
writing by hand on various surfaces, including vellum and parchment and
papyrus, four hundred years ago it was metal impressing ink on paper
(which lasted quite some time, with various changes in structure &
binding), and even 25 years ago the sewn, case-bound book was the
pinnacle. Now it's perfect binding & imprinted bar code. Before long it
will be digitalized, retrievable, electronic information. And someone
will probably find a way to bar code that as well.

        Dear Tom,
        It's nice to hear that we're still friends. If "opposition is true
friendship," then I guess we are now being true friends. Excuse me,
however, if I question yr explanation for referring to me as Spencer
Selby. I'm pretty sure that I'm the only Spencer on here, certainly the
only one that's doing any talking. And I'm pretty sure that everyone knows
that (if they are listening at all), including you.
        If you say a subject is "boring almost beyond bearing," then that
means you want it to go away, and yr Sunday post was as much an attempt to
suppress further discussion on this subject as you, who do not have
control over what gets posted on this list, could possibly have mounted.
So my question is, do you really believe that people can see yr
distinction between wishing so vocally and aggressively that a subject
will go away and an impulse to suppress it?
        I don't think "nominalist" is a fair or accurate label because it
implies that standing is the only goal and source of this negative power.
Standing may be a measure of how much one benefits but it is not
necessarily a measure of how much one encourages the influence of this
power on the scene. One may benefit a lot from "playing the power game"
without ever becoming a name, or one may encourage the power influence
tremendously without benefitting that much.
        Perhaps more important, yr nominalist label does not hint at how
far-ranging the negative effects of the power game are. These effects run
the gamut from pressures on writers to behave and write in certain ways to
misuses of theoretical discourse to confusion of poetic value with a whole
range of factors that have little or nothing to do with such value.  Power
may not be the sole cause or explanation of these and other problems, but
it definitely helps to keep them all going, it definitely influences
writers in ways that make it very difficult (increasingly difficult) for
them to cut through the shit.
        To say that the issue for Gary or Colleen or me is "which poet has
power and which does not" is completely wrong. This is not the big issue
for any of us. If there was a way to talk about the power problem without
ever naming names, I would do it. (I try to avoid naming names as much as
possible. I think if you went back and looked at all my posts on the
subject you would see that I almost never bring up names myself.) But
that's not possible in the face of so much denial that is supposedly
backed up by people's personal experiences, stories, anecdotes, lots of
names and specifics.
        I couldn't agree more that "intentionality is of the
essence of mind."  But this is not a reason to ignore specific
intentionalities, it is a reason to acknowledge and interrogate
them--especially when they have such negative effects, effects that
subvert the best that we are and try to be.
        If by saying the need for power is a condition rather than a
problem, you mean that our condition here today (or in the past, for that
matter) is inevitable, then I must strongly disagree. Our condition is not
inevitable, which is why we can and must struggle to improve it. The need
for power may never go away, but that's no reason not to fight the ways it
specifically manifests itself in our lives.
        Talking about power is not the only way to fight its negative
effects. I never said it was. On the contrary, I have always supported the
scene in a variety of ways, outside of doing and circulating my own work.
In fact, I think I've done more in these terms than many of the people who
like to bring this up as an argument against my belief that power should
be more openly discussed.
        Lastly, another variation on yr own words: the problem of young
poets today is not that they can't publish their own work or find others
to bring out their work in obscure, inexpensively produced editions or
mags, the problem is that of a literary world increasingly organized to
erase this oppositional witness. An important part of this organization is
the built-in denial which comes roaring out with a vengeance if anyone
tries to point it out or talk about it.
        Yrs, Spencer

To Lisa Samuels & Joe Amato -

Consider what a poet's voice might be, though.  It doesn't have to be a
consistent tone of voice or some kind of standardized characterization.  It
can be more like, you know, a voice.

This was said much better in a poem by, I think Ntozake Shange, years ago
(for which I don't have the reference at hand).  Her take was you can
_always_ tell Al Green or Marvin Gaye's voices no matter what they are
singing about.  Charlie Parker or Ornette Coleman always sound like
themselves whether they're playing a slow ballad or a fast blues.  Amiri
Baraka's essay "How You Sound" has some relevance here too.

Don't let the workshop's sense of "poetic voice" take away the range of
your own voice.

i did not mean to say any shop had robbed me of voice, but
rather to respond to joe amato's question about Why this idea
of poetic consistency was around.  yes, inhabiting written
language with the inflections of one's spoken voice has got to
be desirable.  & happens whether we will or no, i should think.

Wrong, Ed, all poetry has politics, none moreso than the poetry that
claims it has none.

Hell, even birds and bees have politics. (In Hawaii, the dominant
ecological niches are fairly unstable. The dominant urban burb of the
1950s, the bulbul, is not that of the late '80s, the mynah. One sees the

Notice how much momentum can build here about power, politics, money,

After rereading Faust (Mephistopheles tells Faust he has to say "come in"

religion.

Ron,

"Jerusalem" is full of ruminations on friendship especially deceitful
friendship and "half" friendship. Maybe that was Duncan's source?

Otherwise, I like (without the word "friendship" though):

"The duty of Opposition is to turn out the government." (John
Diefenbaker)

or

"There is nothing more dreadful to an author than neglect, compared
with which reproach, hatred and opposition are names of happiness."

Not to invalidate Sheila's observation about airport bookstores, since overall
it seems right on, but to offer an odd twist to it: the equal-best bookstore
(along with one other) for poetry in Louisville is, strangely enough, at the
Louisville airport. It's a Waterstone's, which I think is originally a British
chain. It's the only airport bookstore where I've ever even seen poetry, and
they actually have real, legitimate shelves of it with a diverse range of real
books(i.e., not just rod McKuen or bowdlerized Dickinson).

Ron Silliman, one of my old friends and someone I love deeply,

        I don't know how to respond to most of what you cover

If you can use this set of related topics productively in your

trying to downplay the element of what I called agon in the
rleation any poet sustains to what we seem to want to call the
poetic community. I just pointed out that there is a vector of
utility there also, something to push against which one
can always count on being there to push against. Perhaps
foolishly, I accept, even cherish the sense of exile that
attaches to my sense of what it means that I Tom Mandel

        That said, I can't question the accuracy of your
analysis as you draw out the manifold dishonesties and
confusions attaching to this same world which I am saying
I do not wish to change. That is, it is not this effect
on the world which in my work I pose, in the sense that
Duncan has been quoted here, as the ideal of poetry's
power, and strive so to realize.

Forgive me for being shocked, but "PC Movement"??? come on --
Did I miss something -- Has the U.S. government actually recorded an
apology to the Indians (as they did belatedly to the interned
Japanese-Americans)?  Are we all apologized out?

I just had this same discussion with somebody on my campus, somebody who
is violently opposed to affirmative action, who asked me how long we had
to pay for the sins of the past.  Looked to me that the action was pretty
much the other way -- that is, 250 years of several million Africans
working for no pay + all former Indian lands producing capital for
non-Indians = one hell of a lot of money that has gone into the economies
in which we breathe, and to the republic for which we stand --

Now, I don't see much point or humor in the suggestion that all
putatively white people jump off a bridge (which one? London in the
desert?) -- nor do I think we should each run out into the street (or
into our poems) shouting apologies -- nor do I know of any Indian who
wants us to --

But, and here's what I find so troubling, what a transformation from the
attitude expressed by one fairly good writer some years back:

"Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away; yet if it be God's will that it continue until
the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of
unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three
thousand years ago, so still must it be said that the judgements of the
Lord are true and righteous altogether."

This from someone so PC in his attitudes that he once supported the
export of all black people from the US, Abraham Lincon (not the most
progressive in his attitudes towards American Indians either).

A good read, for those interested, is Gerald Vizenor's _Manifest Manners:
Postindian Warriors of Survivance_ -- (read his wild novel _The Heirs of
Columbus_ while you're at it; you'll be glad you did.)

Meanwhile, let's shoot a few flaming arrows into all these straw men that
keep popping up --(or is that virtual straw persons?  the market near my
office now sells tubs of yellowish substance advertised as "Real
Margarine") --

lisa & herb, one reason i bring up the question of 'voice' as such is
that it would seem to (stubbornly) persist despite all sorts of discourses
as to the self's 'fragmented' or multiplicitous state... that is, there
is on the one hand a tendency to celebrate our more schizoid impulses
(and this is an absurdly terse way of intimating deleuze & guattari as
well as work in cognitive science that predicates a more fluid, if you
will, neural substrate) and on the other a reluctance on the part of poets
(in general now) to give up on 'voice' as a category that reveals some
(essential?) quality (of presence, what have you)...

i often wonder whether the 'me' that surfaces through, say, thirty odd
poetic artifacts would so surface had i appended a different name to each...
as so many have demonstrated, name alone is a powerful incitement to read
accordingly...

but also this sense of voice, as you indicate lisa, seems to find its origin
in a more primal urge to identify (i think this is what you're saying anyway)...and if on the one hand (this remark is BOUND to conflate threads) we've given
up, some of us, on a crudely conceived identity politics, on the other we've
NOT given up (institutionally speaking, that is) on attempting to cull some
sense of authorial identity from the work, however aesthetically or personally
conceived... or so it seems...

as a corollary there's also this question of ownership of the poem (a question
that itself is problematized with the advent of things and practices electronic)and whether and to what extent 'voice' of the individual couldn't be predicated
along more social, shared coordinates, as a form of social contract, if you
will, a set of conventions shared uniquely yet in pre-meditated ways...

i ramble... but just so////

Dear Tom:

It's "Enion's Complaint" from _The Four Zoas_. Here's the passage
starting with "What is the price of Experience?":

     "What is the price of Experience? do men buy it for a song?
     Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No, it is bought with
          the price
     Of all that a man hath, his house, his wife, his children.
     Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to
          buy,
     And in the wither'd field where the farmer plows for bread
          in vain.

     "It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun
     And in the vintage & to sing on the waggon loaded with corn.
     It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted,
     To speak the laws of prudence to the houseless wanderer,
     To listen to the hungry raven's cry in wintry season
     When the red blood is fill'd with wine & with the marrow of
          lambs.

     "It is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements,
     To hear the dog howl at the wintry door, the ox in the
          slaughter house moan;
     To see a god on every wind & a blessing on every blast;
     To hear sound of love in the thunder storm that destroys our
          enemies' house;
     To rejoice in the blight that covers his field, & the
          sickness that cuts off his children,
     While our olive & vine sing & laugh round our door, & our

Subject:      Voice mail without the voice (was Digest)

 Dear James,

 I switched to digest literally moments after you scorched (me &) the
 easily restorable anti-hegemony project a few weeks back.

 I find it preferable reading through POETICS once a day, in the
 morning -- part extension of citrus & zazen ritual, part socio-artistic
 research -- rather than throughout all hours. The around-the-clock
 version became too twiggy & psychically draining. What it might be
 like if we were all locked in a Wojnarowiczian warehouse all day
 with each other!? I'm neither more or less inclined to print out or
 respond to what goes on around here as a digester. Though that's
 probably more a function that my main areas of interest / research /
 concern have yet to acheive much, if any, sustained inquiry over the
 past 2 years in this space. Though your question "Can digest really
 digest the material & does that mean it re-morphs the material into
 an indistinguishable mass of components" touches on something I've
 been considering --

 D. N. Rodowick's essay "Audiovisual Culture and Interdisciplinary
 Knowledge," in _New Literary History_ (1995, 26:  111-121)
 describes ours as an "audiovisual culture," "a distinct era driven by
 innovations in telecommunications technology that is promoting the
 convergence of previously distinct media and forms of data
 transmission." "Convergence" is one of the most definitive & emphatic
 buzzwords going, an academically sanctioned phrase, even, at Brown
 U. Rodowick's essay discusses how our formally organic public space
 (warehouse, salon, happening, cafe &c.) is becoming increasingly
 serialized and dispersed in space. So, yeah, the digest -- & to be clear,
 the medium -- certainly reduces our chances of instantaneous rapid
 fire cranial exchange. But it doesn't necessarily seem that these texts
 are made up of / by "indistinguishable mass of components," or are
 virtually re-morphed (?) material. Our letters, words, are leveled to
 the algorithmic manipulation of binary code, and have become "an
 abstract computational space." (Rodowick) But in our familiarities
 with people on the list, can't we say expressivity, if not personality,
 seems to come through in postings? People are relatively consistent
 in tone (or drone, you pick), so it doesn't seem as if the components
 are completely indistiguishable, but maybe. Whatever I am saying, it
 does *seem* like a "space" of some sort, &, given what my sense of
 the Electronic Poetry Center is, are *working* within.

 POETICS seems intrinsically transversal, a hybridization of talking,
 typewriter, telephone (attitude, & other things). We only know of
 each other's readings by either public or private response. Let's
 acknowledge an abyss. It's an undefined and barely definable, highly
 contestable "space", and maybe we could chat about it until we are as
 blue in the face as in dream. As far as such engagement goes,
 amongst poets, who wants to discuss and contest what it is, or isn't?
 Speak and you shall be read in this space! (Not only that, your ideas
 will be archived and quoted.) Most non-elite poets are resistant to, if
 not violently against, technology (contributing somewhat to their
 own self-isolation) in sometimes connected yet always fragmentary
 cults around the world. We have it and (dare I say) should be talking
 about it.

 It's an easily erasable slate, yes, but digest, for me, presents
 materials in a healthy way, given the medium. I was writing about
 the Sun Ra listserv, Saturn, last month, whose work I've been most
 impressed by as it serves to preserve and provide a continuum for
 an entire language and subculture. Some of what appeals to me about
 that particular list (which I also take as digest):

        There are quiet, resting periods on Saturn, spans of days at a
        time where there is no talk at all. This attribute testifies to the >
        sanity of the list, whereby the persons involved also take time
        away from it for other satisfying and nurturing creative
        activities. It is non-obsessive and progressive, "inexplicable
        presence - Warm, intuitive/Rare vital - Essence energy" as Sun
        Ra says in the poem "Essence Energy". (Extensions Out, 16)

        Sun Ra compared words to magic substances:  they are
        combined and a reaction takes place. Words can change things.
        Such a concept is comparable with the living word, the
        "nommo" of the West African Dogon tribe where "The word is
        for all in this world; it must be exchanged, so that it goes and
        comes, for it is good to give and to receive the forces of life."
        (Jahn 124) In our unliberated present, in our non-oppositional
        tone on Saturn, we find not a dialectic as much as what Kamau
        Brathwaite calls a "tidalectic," a flow, and ebbing and flooding,
        erasure, coverage, interrelation, "like the movement of the
        ocean, coming from one continent, touching another, and then
        receding from the islands into echoes." (Brathwaite 9). Such a
        poetics sees expression as a journey setting out from a
        continent to a set of islands which is barely coming to be
        understood by its inhabitants.

Can I use this discussion of jazz and poetry to ask whether anyone
out there can tell ne something I have been wondering about for a
long time?

Last I heard of Albert Ayler, he was found in the East River. Is that
right? But I want to know the latest on Don Ayler. When Albert died,
Don was reportedly in some house for the criminally insane or
something. Can anyone tell me more about the story of these two great
musicians I was lucky enough to hear live and up close?

"M.L. Liebler writes with passion and an intense understanding of his
subject matter. He wants his poems to catch fire in his audience's heart and
burn down the apathy, ignorance, and hatred planted there and nurtured by
not taking responsibility for one's own action. Liebler is primarily a
performance poet, his poetry meant for the physical act of speaking out and
talking back."
    --Faye Kicknowsway

"M.L. Liebler is on that great stream of the American Bard. His poems are a
mix of advanced politics, lyrics of a tightly woven family, and the hunger
to perform poetry and to perform it well. He is searching admist the throbs
of the consonant and the flights of the vowel for a new and better life for
all."
    --Ed Sanders

"M.L. Liebler is a tremendous source of poetry energy in The Motor City and
beyond."
    --John Sinclair

"M.L. Liebler is a complex mix of poet, university professor, performance
poet, Lollapalooza performer and Christian writer... he has played a vital
role in keeping the poetry scene alive during its dark days of the 70s and 80s."
    --_The Detroit News_

"Liebler writes close clipped verse of a political bent that reflects his
anger and angst over the aftermath of the Vietnam War. He plumbs his soul,
searching ut a distinctive voice that reflects his Michigan homeland and
extends the legacy of noted Midwestern poet James Wright."

This brings up an interesting point. First, not to overlook the
richness of one's library. A constant source of encouragement. But the
scene is changing. And poetry people might wish to take note. I still
insist that an early issue of _C_ is hardly available to most. But
think of this... big libraries, for example, U of Mich and U of CA
Berkeley, are putting tremendous efforts into _converting_ past issues
of magazines to digital format. What do they choose? You guessed it,
the 100 most used mags from Readers Guide or whatever. Like there
aren't enough copies of _Time_ or even academic journals around. UC
Berkeley just announced a project like this to the tune of $4 million,
$1 million per year over four years...

So where does that leave us?

We must see that _our_ backlist makes it into this digital source of
available info. That is why I've been so enthusiastic about the
cataloging project at hand. And I've had some offers from some good
publishers about putting back issues up. (_Witz_ for one, is very
active in this regard. And Luigi Bob Drake is working assiduously with
TREE.)

So really, though I _adore_ my copies of C, of which I have a couple
and read with great relish, I cannot resist reflecting on my poetic
upbringing and the comments like "when Duncan wrote ... in
_Caterpillar_ and though I wanted to know, it was out of reach. Hence,
Duncan was removed from a genuine interest...

All to say, a recognition of the prospects at hand. I again encourage
magazine publishers to think in such a way that will land this
material into hands of interested readers. I urge those of you out
there who are publishing think about this; let's act. I've secured
computer resources and this is an opportunity not to extend production
but to move these words to people who may very well be receptive...

Aldon,
        I just don't see how apologies really make anything better.  I was
just downtown and the Hudson's bay Company was advertising its 325
birthday, boasting of 325 years of service and excellence- or as I view it
300 years of rape and pillage, but that doesn't mean I'm going to feel
guilty about the bikini I bought.  Just as how my Japanese friends feel
nothing for the documents that the Canadian gov't released concerning the
Japanese redress mov't.  How does sorry and $500 compensate for the
destruction of a family.  I acknowledge the shit in my ancestor's history
and believe that it should never be forgotten, but I will not kiss anymore
ass to compensate for being born white.

        Nor do i think relabeling people and cultures is going to
eliminate racism and that's where the PC mov't drives me nuts.  The
Canadian gov't has recently put a lot of investment in the ministry of
Ethnic Affairs, and is now shocked that they are receiving bad press for
reverse discrimination.  The word ethnic is now assumed to mean anything
non-white. Shouldn't I be offended that my Norwegian, Scottish, German,
Newfie background is considered non ethnic. Likewise would you want to be
published just because you were considered to be an ethnic writer, not
necessarily talented?

I'm surprised to hear that NYC doesn't have good bookstores.  Living in a
place that really doesn't have good bookstores, Sheboygan Wisconsin, I was
looking forward to my NEH Summer Sem this June & July in NYC to catch up on
the new books I hear everyone on the list talking about.  Imagine my surprise
upon hearing that the Big Apple is so bereft of good books!

I would extend what Sheila says out from airports to almost all bookstores --
Waldenbooks, Little Professor (those the chains we have here), etc, as well
as most of the respectable coffee-house types.  But there is at least one
good bookstore in the state of Wisconsin that I know of, and another that's
passable, so I would assume there's at least one or two in NY.

In anticipation of my summer there, could I hear from anyone who wants to
contest Kenneth Goldsmith's sad assessment of NY's finest (bookstores, that
is)?  I don't expect to be able to find everything in SPD, but find it hard
to believe I won't be able to find any of it there.  And there's no Fodor's
radical poetries guidebook, unfortunately.

Subject:      Re: digest

For me with digest it's changed space that's at issue.  I did it (set digest
option) to save space, so my files weren't enormous lists and so I could just
zip through quickly.  But a corresponding inattentiveness has come along with
it.  I spend less time, but/so I spend less time, if you see what I mean.
 And it's easier to let things back up.  My silence for about the past month
has been due to starting to let my digest messages back up to the point where
there were five, then ten, then more and it didn't look like much so I wasn't
so alarmed at first.  Then I realized the work in store for me catching up
and let it go even longer.  Now I'm getting back to it, but had to decide
whether to catch up or start again with the current messages.  If I read
something that I wanted to respond to but was posted 2 weeks ago, I couldn't
respond, really, and I did, and didn't.  So I'm doing both at once: reading
messages 2-3 weeks old that I can't talk to (Hallmark and Why Teach, for
instance) and current messages I can.  It's strangely like literature:
reading the past that's alluded to in current conversation as well as who's
doing what now.  I didn't like digest at first, but now I'm getting into it.
 I never used to read everything, but selected things by subject when I
didn't have time.  Now I at least skim everything and the "community" is
there, even if it is arbitrarily selected as Loss suggests.  It isn't as easy
to save particular entries anymore either, nor is it as easy to find things
in my own archives.  There's good and bad, again as Loss tells us.

As for another subject Loss raises, that all this is saved, I wonder if it
ever will be read.  At first I was unnerved by the fact that these messages
were all saved and that this thus constituted "publication" in a sense -- I'm
so horrified by most of what I write that most of it gets thrown out.  About
half the time I write messages I erase them before sending them out, and
that's just because I don't even want them read once, let alone them being
electronicly stored forever (or at least until SUNY goes bankrupt).  But with
a medium that produces so much language that we have trouble keeping up with
it in our own time, I wonder what the chances are of these things ever being
read.  It reminds me of a desire a pop-culture scholar expressed to me a few
years ago: that every moment of television broadcasting, commercials and all,
on all channels and cables stations, should be recorded somewhere and
preserved, to be a record of this medium, its expressions, just as they
happen.  What would result (and perhaps already is resulting if someone
somewhere is already doing this, which wouldn't surprise me) is an amount of
stored information far in excess of what could actually be experienced: one
can't nearly watch everything that is happening right now, much less
everything that was broadcast at some time in the past (now, from some future
vantage point).  OK, I'm sure _someone_ will delve into this stuff ("Hi,
future!  Have you cured AIDS yet?") but its enormity seems so unmanageable to
me that my hat is off to that future scholar.  But then I haven't gone into
these archives myself.  Loss, how is it organized?  Could you look for a
specific post, or sender?  I suppose I'm thinking of future digest
recipients, as it were, reading a past as if a present (although
technological innovations will of course one day make all this stuff we're so
enamored of resemble 8-track tape or hieroglyphed papyrus).  Could I just
pick out posts by, say, Jim Pangborn (hi, Jim!), and skip all the other
stuff?  I suppose that which is saved can always be indexed, later if not
now.  But think of it accumulating, day after day, year after year, in many
more forums that we aren't even aware of now.  Will there come a point when
we decide "Fuck the present, there's far too much past to deal with"?  I
think the tendency will always be (and increasingly?) more toward "Fuck the
past, I have too much present to deal with".

Ted,

My thought is that it's always easy, if you live in New York, to say
there are no good bookstores. True, I'll go into _any_ bookstore, even
the most commercial in hopes of finding _something_ but I can't
believe there isn't fun to be had...

For one thing, there's an online list of nyc bookstores. If you use
gopher and therefore veronica and can do a search like bookstores and
new york, you'll get a guide.

I always like the French bookstore over (where?) is it Rodkefeller
Center (the big Christmas tree) where there's lot's of stuff in
foreign languages.

There's the "wise men fish here" place. What's the name of that?
Mid-town.

And of course the Strand. What - Broadway, up from G Village.

And there's one place I haven't found since Ted Joans took me there
years ago. In the Village, what West Village. Not far from one of
those city playgrounds where people play outdoor chess at the same
table for years. I wish I could remember the name. It had a store
front window and inside, you know the first edition thing, signed
copies, etc., but what an incredible place. If anyone on the list
could identify this. I'd be grateful.

Of course once or twice I've been lucky when in NYC that my visit
coincided with the Small Press Expo or whatever it's called, the full
range of Hanuman titles, lots of other stuff.

But I'd also be interested in hearing about the out of the way place,
for the next voyage out from Buffalo. (Not that Buffalo could
complain, with Talking Leaves, yet the smaller used places (like I've
found in Chicago and New Orleans) are always the charm.

There is even a used place across the street from Columbia, no (to the
east)? Though I don't think I got anything there that changed my life.

But I'd be interested in hearing some names/address of places...

All best,
Loss

Ted,

I went ahead and go the online list for you. If anyone on the list has
comments about any of these - or can identify that spot in the
village, I'd be grateful.

(Oh yes, Shakespeare and St. Mark's also good for new books...)

Working south through Manhattan:
==========UPTOWN=============
NRS Books (used) (118th & Amsterdam, across from Columbia U)
        Cavernous, twisty store; small but often interesting.  Mixed
        salespeople--some very good.  A gamble.  Identify the
        mystery quote of the day and get an additional 20% off your
        purchase.  Paul, the owner, used to have a weakness for
        complete sets--old encyclopedias, bound collections of
        American Heritage, and so on.
        Extensive humanities and soc. sci. sections, very
        reasonable prices, and lots of gems.

??? Used Books (115th & Amsterdam, above the post office)
        I've never been there--I think they have a lot of used
        course books.

Columbia Univ. Bookstore (Barnes & Noble) (Broadway and 115th)
        The usual Barnes & Noble selection as well as textbooks for
        courses at Columbia.  Higher prices than many other stores,
        but a very large selection, even for B&N.  The downtown store
        has textbooks for NYU.

Barnard Bookforum (Broadway and 115th)
        A very good bookstore with many of Barnard's textbooks, plus a
        generally strong selection and helpful staff.  Surprising
        Russian-language section in the back.

Papyrus (Broadway & 114th)
        A fairly large collection of left-wing books and magazines
        (on film, literature, etc., as well as politics).
        "I'm not sure if they're worth a special trip, but check
        them out if you're in the neighborhood."

Pomander Books (955 West End Avenue--also described as Broadway at
        107th, on the SW corner, down the stairs) (212-866-1777).
        A good used-book store. This is the same bookstore that was next
        to the Thalia.  Lots of art books, some hard to find.  If it
        matters, West End runs into Broadway just north of there, which
        is why the address is misleading.

Paperback Discounter (west side of Broadway just south of 94th Street).
        There are lots of used and otherwise discounted paperbacks, but
        the collection, which is eclectic and interesting, is--by those
        very attributes--not very reliable.  (They also rent videotapes,
        and if you look mainly at the signs in the window you'll notice an
        ad for VCR repair that might distract you from the display of
        paperbacks in the window.)

Black Books Plus (Amsterdam and 94th)
        Specialty is Black interest and Third World concerns.

Funny Business (northwest corner of Amsterdam and 93rd)
        A comic book store of unknown quality.

The Military Bookman (29 East 93rd) (212-348-1280)
        Specializing in used military books.  Their selection is
        excellent, but they are usually a bit pricey.  It's the
        sort of place that military buffs all know about, but
        call only as a last resort.  They issue a catalog (about
        3 times a year), and otherwise engage in mail order.
        (One poster reports that they contacted him recently about
        a book he had told them he was looking for at least three
        years ago, so they keep track of these things.)
        No credit card/phone orders.

Kitchen Arts & Letters, Inc. (1435 Lexington Ave at 93rd)
        (212-876-5550).  Quoting from their brochure: "the country's
        largest store devoted completely to books on food and wine.
        With well over 7000 cooking titles and access to thousands of
        out-of-print titles through our free search service..."
        From a reader: "While the sale prices at Jessica's Biscuit beat
        these peoples' full-list prices, this probably is a good place to
        keep in mind for unusual and hard to find cookery books.  Sounds
        like a fun place to browse, in any case..."  Does credit card and
        phone orders.  (Mon 1-6, Tue-Fri 10-6:30, Sat 11-6.  Summer hours
        less regular; mostly closed Saturdays in July and open only 2-3
        days per week in August.)

The Corner Bookstore (Madison at 93rd)
        They specialize in children's books and travel books, but
        they also have a film connection: not only is this the bookstore
        where Nick Nolte found the "Renata Halpern" children's book in
        THE PRINCE OF TIDES, it's also just one block south of
        the red brick fortress/castle facade featured in THE FISHER KING.

Murder Ink (Broadway btwn 92nd and 93rd)
        As you might suspect, it specializes in mysteries and had a
        very good collection (as did The Mysterious Bookstore).

Barnes & Noble Books (Lexington north of 86th) (also downtown)
        New "super-store" (opened 6/26/92).  "The old 86th St. Barnes &
        Noble has moved around the corner and has expanded into what is
        certainly one of the finest bookstores in the city.  A huge
        bookstore with a lovely decor, desks for reading, a knowledgeable
        staff, and a well-stocked (and well-laid-out) selection, this new
        store is an absolute pleasure.  Kudos to B&N on this one."

East West Books (Columbus north of 86th) (also downtown)
        Stocks books on Buddhism, Taoism, Sufism, Indian Religions also
        New Age, self-improvement, health and healing.  Cards, jewelry,
        audio tapes, incense.  Good sized stock.

Met Museum Store (5th Avenue & 82nd)
        They have neat art books, posters, engagement calendars,
        videos etc.

Shakespeare & Co. (81st & Broadway) (also downtown) (212-580-7800)
        A good, large selection, they're good about getting in the new
        stuff quickly.  One person said, "Much like Coliseum, but closes
        earlier," but now it has expanded its hours until 11:30 (12:30
        on Friday and Saturday nights).  It also expanded upstairs a few
        years ago.

Endicott Books (81st & Columbus)
        A very good selection, with salespeople who like to
        read (really--this isn't all that common).  A good
        store.  Sometimes they sponsor readings by authors.

Burlington Books (81st & Madison)
        Lots of current titles, art books, as well as used books.  They'll
        special order anything, and will do active searches for out-of-print
        titles.  They often buy out estates, so you're almost always bound
        to find something new each time you go in.  Just a block away from
        the Metropolitan Museum.  Definitely worth stopping into.

Gryphon Bookshop (2246 Broadway btwn 80th & 81st)
        They have a nice selection, and will do active searches for
        one.
        OK, but too expensive. They have an Annex around the corner
        (at 246 W 80th off Broadway away from Amsterdam, on the
        south side of the street, one flight up) that sells everything
        at 50% off the listed price. That makes it reasonable (in most
        cases). Enormous lit & history sections.
        Gryphon has charm and has recently expanded.  The new store
        is on Broadway and is new and shiny, but the old store is
        around the corner and is dark and twisty and has a
        mysterious locked closet which contains a vast trove of old
        L. Frank Baum hardcovers (another poster says these bookcases are
        in the new store).  The Gryphon is probably one of the world
        centers for Wizard of Oz books.  They also do searches.

Eeyore's (83rd off Broadway)
        Children's books; Sunday readings and other activities for
        kids.  Excellent, with a friendly, knowledgeable staff.

Storyland (3rd Avenue at 78th)

Museum of Natural History Book Store (in the Museum; 77th at CPW)
        No guarantees, but they used to have an interesting
        selection of books on nature and natural history.

Books & Co (Madison at 74th)
        Art, literature etc.  Wonderful feeling, nice place to shop.
        Another good literate person's bookstore, reminiscent of
        Endicott.  I've seen celebs shopping there, too (David
        Byrne; Kathleen Turner)
        List priced new books, but very eclectic with a philosophy
        bent.

Barnes & Noble (Broadway and 74th)

Courtly Music (2067 Broadway btwn 71st and 72nd, suite 27 (on
        the second floor--not well-labeled on the door)).  Hours are
        9:45-5:45 Tuesday to Saturday and they also have an 800 number
        (2-RICHIE).  "The focus is on early music, and they have books,
        instruments, tapes (I don't recall if they have LPs or CDs),
        instruction tapes and books, and give lessons.  I saw someone
        behind the desk wrapping something, so it looks like they will
        do mail order.  The staff seemed knowledgeable, and xeroxed off
        a sheet for my friend of local branches of the American Recorder
        Society for him to contact.  All in all a nice shop."

Applause Books (211 W. 71st west of Broadway) (212-496-7511)
        They specialize in film and theatre; some books that can
        be found nowhere else.

Civilized Traveler (Broadway between 66th and 72nd).  Opened spring of
        '92, it's an upscale travel store with guidebooks and maps as
        well as suitcases and a variety of gadgets and conveniences
        for travelers.  "Their collection isn't vast, but I'm hoping it
        will build."

==========MIDTOWN=============
Argosy (59th btwn Park & Lexington)
        They are very strong in used hardcover fiction (no sf
        though), particularly older things from say circa 1920,
        like James Branch Cabell.  They also sell old prints and
        Americana.
        Antique and used books, maps, and prints.
        Some beautiful books, but the owners are major goniffs
        (thieves) so you'll have to hunt for bargains.
        It is about five stories high and is one of those
        books-stacked-up-the-walls-to-the-ceiling places; dim,
        musty, dense, mysterious.  You get the feeling that you
        could find anything at all there if you only looked long
        enough.

Barnes & Noble (6th Avenue and 57th)

Books Nippon (57th btwn 5th & 6th Avenues)
        Books, cards, magazines in Japanese and English.  Fair-sized
        collection of English language books on a variety of
        Japanese-related topics, including a large number of art
        books.  Also a large supply of Japanese language books and
        periodicals.

J. N. Bartfield Fine Books (30 W 57th (3rd floor) btwn 5th & 6th Avenues)
        This is a gallery-like place that carries mostly bound sets of
        literature.  Much of what they carry looks like old versions of
        the fancy-book-of-the-month club-featuring-the-great-works-of-
        literature-in-genuine-hand-tooled-leather offers that are
        available these days.  I am not, however, an old book expert so
        I am not sure if that is a bad thing.  I saw an old Vergil
        edition for $495; this place ain't cheap but may be worth a
        visit.

Rizzoli's (57th btwn 5th & 6th Avenues)
        Probably the premier art book store in the city.  Lots of
        fun stuff, also foreign books + periodicals
        A classy place, strong on art books.
        Opulent bookstore specializing in art/architecture/design
        books.
        Italian Bookstore chain.  Excellent art, design, and
        architecture sections.  New books at list prices.
        If you like glossy art books at full price try Rizzoli's.
        (Also has a downtown and a WTC store)

Hacker Art Books (4 West 57th Street) (212-688-7600)

Coliseum Books (57th & Broadway Avenue)
        A good stock of new books, and open until eleven or
        midnight.  An independent.
        "Coliseum is vast and carries everything that is in
        somebody's mainstream; it is the only place I know, for
        example, to purchase a copy of QUOTATIONS OF CHAIRMAN
        MAO off the shelf."  (But see below for a bookstore in
        Chinatown that also has it.)
        "Coliseum is large, and has a wide selection.  I have not
        found the staff to be very helpful.  I wanted to special
        order a book, and was told I could only do it Mon-Fri
        during daytime hours.  Looking through the literature
        section, I found that they had nearly every single Martin
        Amis book, but none by Kingsley Amis -- Not even LUCKY
        JIM.  They have a terrific poetry section."

Forbidden Planet (228 East 59th btwn 2nd & 3rd Avenues)
        The store on 12th street is better, IMHO.

The Mysterious Book Shop (129 W. 56th)
        Mystery books and so on.  It also has its own publishing company
        so they also have the latest copies of their own line
        of mysteries.  Book-signings by authors.

Patelson's  (56th & 6th Ave, just behind Carnegie Hall)
        The best place in NYC for books about music.  A huge selection
        covering all genres.  They also are NYC's most-popular source
        for classical music scores.  They can special-order *anything*
        music-related and will ship.

Doubleday (5th Ave & 53rd) -- like Dalton's...
        They have access to everything, and order what's good, not
        just what sells.  Good store, decent selection, often good
        salespeople.  One of the best mystery book selections in the
        city outside of the mystery specialty stores.  Book-signings.
        At the front of the store is a bookcase of signed books at
        regular prices.

MOMA Bookstore (in the Museum) (53rd btwn 5th & 6th Avenues)
        Good selection of books on art, and art books; great poster
        section; you *don't* have to pay admission to get in.
        At Christmas they expand across the street, or used to.
        More neat stuff.

B. Dalton (5th Avenue & 53nd)
        Granddaddy B. Dalton which is worth stopping into if you're
        in the neighborhood.  It is a lot better than the usual
        run-of-the-mill mall rat B. Daltons and is well-stocked,
        especially if you are looking for recent releases.
        Also one on 8th and 6th Avenue.

Rand McNally  (52nd btwn Lexington & 3rd Avenue)
        Lots of national and international maps, guide books, globes.

Sky Books International Inc (48 E. 50th)
        Look carefully since this is a small place on the second floor.
        Their specialty is in military and aviation books and magazines
        of which they have a good selection.  In addition to hardcover
        and paperback fiction, they have a good deal of stuff on tactics,
        uniforms, history, aircraft, weapons, etc.  They carry a number
        of magazines which will be of interest to the plane freak and/or
        model builder.  Prices are reasonable but not really bargains.
        They have a good bulletin board for those interested in buying
        and selling military paraphernalia.

Librarie De France (Rockefeller Center, a small storefront on the Promenade
        (near the skating rink, opposite the Teuscher's Chocolate shop :-)
        The Promenade is located off of 5th Avenue, between 49th and 50th
        streets) (212-581-8810)
        Run by the same people as the French-Spanish Bookstore, a slightly
        bigger store downtown on 5th at 19th street, which has many, many
        more dictionaries.  At first, the store appears to be very small,
        but there is a downstairs section whith about five or six times the
        space as the upstairs.  I had been in the store several times before
        I discovered the downstairs section.  A very large selection of
        French novels, short stories, non-fiction, etc.  Some newspapers,
        magazines, and records.  They also have a reasonably large selection
        of dictionaries and instruction books for other languages.  Prices
        tend to be high.  Staff is usually fluent in French.

Kinokuniya Bookstore (49th btwn 5th & 6th Avenues)
        Japanese books, origami paper, etc.  Very large and
        usually very busy.  Japanese tour buses stop here
        because of its proximity to Rockefeller Center.  A bit
        expensive but much better than any other Japanese
        bookstore in New York.

Drama Book Shop (723 7th Avenue at 48th) (212-944-0595)

McGraw-Hill Book Store (48th & 6th Avenue in the basement of the
        McGraw-Hill building.)
        Best bet for technical books in the city.
        An excellent selection for technical books, especially
        computer books.  Their mathematics section is also good,
        as is their finance section.  All publishers.

Shinbato (McGraw Hill Bldg)
        Specializes in Japanese books and books pertaining to the
        Japanese.

Gotham Book Mart  (47th btwn 5th & 6th)
        Excellent poetry, literature, philosophy etc.  Practically
        unique in the world.

United Nations Bookshop (General Assembly Building, E 45 St & First Ave)
        (212-963-7680)
        Has international affairs books, and UN publications.

Urban Center Books (457 Madison Ave) (212-935-3592)
        Great place for Architecture/Planning/Urban Design Books

Travel Bookstore (199 Madison at 35th)
        Important collection of maps, guides and books.  Very
        knowledgeable staff composed largely of travel-addicts, as
        opposed to the younger Rand-McNally staff.  Many more travel
        commentary books than strict guide books.

Macy's (34th & 7th Avenue)
        Surprisingly good!

Pak Books (27th btwn 3rd & Lexington)
        Books on Middle Eastern culture, philosophy, etc.


==========DOWNTOWN/VILLAGE=============
Samuel French bookstore and reading room (45 W 25th) (212-206-8990)
        Open 9-5 M-Fri; their ad says "1000's of play titles; out of
        print archives for Samual French plays; bookstore & reading
        room open to the public".  I've never been there; caveat
        tourist.

Victor Kamk(a)in (149 5th Avenue south of 22nd) (212-677-0776).
        Russian Language bookstore.  It's said to be good.  ("That 'a'
        appears in the Yellow Pages but not in the White Pages.  No,
        I'm really not that compulsive, I just tripped over the
        discrepancy once.")

The French-Spanish Bookstore (5th Avenue and 19th)
        A very large selection of French and Spanish novels, short stories,
        non-fiction, etc.  Some newspapers, magazines, and records.  They
        also have a reasonably large selection of dictionaries and
        instruction books for other languages.  Prices tend to be high.
        They have a slightly smaller store uptown in Rockefeller Center.
        Staff is usually fluent in French or Spanish.

Academy Bookstore (18th btwn 5th and 6th Avenues)
        Small, well-kept.
        Has strong humanities and soc.sci. section.  Also a large
        supply of used CDs, especially classical and opera!

Skyline Bookstore (13 18th btwn 5th and 6th Avenues)
        Across the street from Academy and apparently owned by the same
        person.  This one has a slightly different focus than Academy.

Book-Friends Cafe (18th btwn 5th and 6th Avenues)
        The store is run by Elizabeth Cymmerman.  It specializes in works
        between 1890 and 1940 and, in addition, serves food and drink.
        There is also a list of scheduled readings posted on the door.
        The collection is small but the place seems inviting.  The
        concentration is on biography, hardback fiction, and gracious living.

Barnes & Noble (18th & 5th Avenue)
        The sales annex, which is largely remaindered,
        used, and discontinued books, and so on, is big.
        A whole store for half-price stuff and another whole store
        for textbooks.  I think it is less well laid out than
        Coliseum, but it is also better-stocked on some recent
        things and is often cheaper.
        The retail store across 5th Avenue is also huge,
        with a great reference section.

Brunner/Mazel (19 Union Square West, 8th Floor) (212-924-3344)
        Mostly psychology.

? (14th btwn 6th and 7th Avenues)
        Spanish-language bookstore.  Big selection.  Staff speaks
        Spanish and English.

East West Books (5th Avenue btwn 13th and 14th) (also uptown)
        Stocks books on Buddhism, Taoism, Sufism, Indian Religions also
        New Age, self-improvement, health and healing.  Cards, jewelry,
        audio tapes, incense.  Good sized stock.

Books of Wonder (17th & 7th Avenue)
        Heavenly gift to adults who like children's books.  Everything
        from first editions to the latest paperbacks.  They do readings
        periodically.  Periodic newsletter they'll send to customers
        announcing new books.

Revolution Books (16th btwn 5th Ave & Union Square)
        Huge Marxist & otherwise left wing inventory.

Book Scientific (16th btwn 5th Avenue & Union Square)
        Scientific and technical books; good selection, 10% discount
        to faculty or university researchers.  They'll order books, and
        ship them.  With university ID, there are often extra discounts.
        Best stock in the city of scientific books, and they offer
        a 5% discount to students.  It's hard to find on its own, being on
        the 2nd floor with a tiny sign, but it's directly across from the
        large red "Revolution Books" banner.

Book Source (16th btwn 5th Avenue & Union Square)
        Large used- and rare-book store, on the same floor as Book
        Scientific.  "Nice collection of plays, but I don't remember much
        else about it."

Different Light (Hudson near 14th)
        Gay and lesbian bookstore.

Biography Bookshop (Bleecker & 12th)
        One poster says, "Nice store, but try the Strand first -- this
        place is way overpriced."  (Editorial note: this probably just
        means that new books are in general over-priced.)

Mysterious Bookstore (Foul Play) (8th Avenue & 12th)
        Mysteries & horror.

Strand Books (828 Broadway & 12th) (212-473-1452 or 800-366-3664)
        This place is huge.  They specialize in reviewers'
        copies for half-price, used books, and the out of print.
        "The Strand is one of the world's largest bookstores, and
        yet the employees there, unlike those in many smaller
        bookstores, really do know what is on the shelves and can
        tell you immediately whether or not they have what you are
        looking for:
            'Do you have "The Complete Encyclopedia of Illustration,"
                by...'
            'By Heck.  No, sorry; we don't.'
        is a much better answer than :
            'Uh, gee, I dunno...look around on the shelves.'"
        Open Mon-Sat 9:30 AM-9:30 PM, Sun 11 AM-9:30 PM.
        There's a much smaller branch at the South Street Seaport,
        and I've seen a mini-branch of a few portable bookracks on
        Fifth Avenue along Central Park.  The Strand has a separate
        store for antiquarian books next to the main store (not at
        ground level), accessible by escort or appointment. This store
        has a good selection of original editions and valuable books.

Forbidden Planet (12th & Broadway)
        "The Science Fiction and Fantasy Flea Market."  Books, comic
        books, posters, magazines--if you're at all into this stuff,
        it's worth it.  (Editorial note: I prefer the Science Fiction
        Shop--it has a *much* better selection of books, while FP seems
        too involved in marketing peripheral stuff.)

Three Lives Book Store (154 W 10th east of 7th Ave.)
        A wide variety of subject matter, but seeming to concentrate on
        women authors, reissues of 1920s and 1930s books.  Very
        interesting place to browse.

Judith's Room (Washington btwn Charles & 10th)
        "I found this when I was hunting for a copy of Christine de
        Pisan's 'Book of the City of Women' to use in a medieval philosophy
        class.  Not available in any university bookstore I searched, nor in
        B&N or Strand.  Not only did Judith's Room have the book, but the
        saleswoman had read it and could discuss it, and recommend other
        books by Christine, and other women of that period."  It's also the
        only feminist bookstore in the city.  They sponsor readings.

Oscar Wilde Bookstore (Christopher btwn Gay and Greenwich Ave.)
        Gay and lesbian books.  This is a much older store than A
        Different Light, and was probably the first such in the city.
        (And, yes, it really is near Gay St!)

Pageant, 109 E 9th, off 4th Avenue
        Woody Allen shot one of the scenes in HANNAH AND HER
        SISTERS here.  Offbeat -- a peculiar mishmash of unexpected
        gems buried in the dreck. I recently got an absolutely mint
        first edition of William Gaddis' JR here for $5 -- not the
        first time I've found a terrific book in this place for
        next to nothing.
        Probably some real finds in the incredibly disordered
        upstairs -- I've never had the patience....

St. Marks Bookshop (St. Mark's Place (8th St) btwn 2nd & 3rd Avenues)
        "A GREAT bookstore.  Excellent selection of books for the
        downtown intellectual." Though they had some financial
        difficulties in the past, they are now in the black again.
        Open fairly late.  Smart, sometimes helpful, staff.

B. Dalton (8th & 6th Avenue)
        Worth stopping into if you're in the neighborhood.
        Well-stocked, especially if you are looking for recent
        releases.  Also one on 5th Avenue & 53nd.

Esoterica (61 4th Avenue just north of Astor Place)
        Large stock of books on Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, occult
        and New Age.  Incense, jewelry, audio tapes.

Cooper Square Books (21 Astor Place) (212-533-2595)
        Very large selection, non-existent staff.  Better prices at Tower
        Books, slightly better staff at St. Mark's Books.

??? (7th btwn 1st Avenue & Avenue A)
        There is a bookstore (a slight walkdown from the street) on
        the south side of the street, that has some great stuff and
        the prices are very good. I don't know its name, or even if
        it has one, but the owner is a older woman who has been in
        the neighborhood a long time. She's slightly nutty, but you
        can always play tourist and avoid confrontation.

Shakespeare & Co. (Broadway just north of 4th ) (also uptown)
        A good, large selection, they're good about getting in the
        new stuff quickly.

Tower Books (Lafayette & 4th)
        Good selection, open late, reasonable prices, eclectic
        selection of magazines and out-of-town newspapers.
        Pretty good discounts for hardbacks and best sellers.

Art Bookstore? (Broadway and Bond)
        An excellent art bookstore.

The Art of Reading (Mercer and Bleeker)
        Piles of used books, and (for a change) strong sections in
        math & science. They also have loads of used textbooks.

Science Fiction Shop (Bleeker west of Thompson)
        Moved from their old Eighth Avenue location.  This one *does*
        have enough room to swing a (small) cat in; it also shares
        the second floor with a comics store that is quite good.

Rizzoli's (454? W Broadway around Prince)
        Italian Bookstore chain.  Excellent art, design, and architecture
        sections; probably the premier art book store in the city.  New
        books at list prices.  Lots of fun stuff, also foreign books and
        periodicals.  "A classy place, strong on art books."  "Opulent
        bookstore specializing in art/architecture/design books."  Has
        an espresso bar.  (Also has an uptown and a WTC store) (For
        out-of-towners, note that W Broadway is an entirely separate
        street from Broadway, running parallel to it and about four blocks
        west.)

Guggenheim Soho Museum (Broadway and Prince)
        A good art bookstore (big surprise, right?).  There's absolutely
        no reason to visit Rizzoli's and not here, or vice versa.  (For
        out-of-towners, note that W Broadway is an entirely separate
        street from Broadway, running parallel to it and about four blocks
        west.)

Untitled Cards (159 Prince)
        Before art postcard shops became something to franchise,
        there were cramped stores like this jammed with an
        exquisite selection of cards.  Another branch on W. Broadway
        is more spacious and has an extensive art book selection,
        but lacks the down-home feel of the original.

Spring Street Books (169 Spring near Thompson)
        Another great collection.  It is not a large place, but it is
        filled with wonderful books.  The poetry section is quite good,
        for such a small store.  They also have a nice selection of
        magazines.  The recent fiction section is arranged alphabetically
        by title, rather than by author.

Soho Books (351 W Broadway, 1/2 block below Broome) (212-226-3395).
        Opened May '92.  Good assortment of used books in a wide variety of
        subject areas; biography section seemed especially diverse.  Worth
        dropping into on your way to buy new books at Spring St. Books and
        Rizzoli.

Oriental Culture Enterprises Co, Inc (13-17 Elizabeth,212-226-8461),
        second floor.  Open Friday-Wednesday, 10 am to 7 pm.
        "I got my five-volume SELECTIONS FROM MAO ZEDONG there.
        (They have it in English, too, by the way, along with Lenin,
        Marx, and others.  But finding the books in English is not easy,
        particularly if you don't speak Chinese.)  A great selection of
        books, most of which are in Chinese.  They also sell things needed
        for Chinese calligraphy, Chinese musical instruments, recordings of
        Chinese music, Chinese-language periodicals, and many other
        things Chinese.  An attached art gallery sells paintings.
        While browsing through the books, sit down and enjoy a cup of
        tea free of charge.  Well worth a visit.  Two complaints: it's
        more expensive than it should be, and too many of the books
        are damaged (by careless customers, or by thoughtless staff?).
        Unquestionably the best bookstore in all of Chinatown."

Irish Books and Graphics (90 W Broadway near Chambers)
        New and used books mostly related to Irish history and culture.
        Selection of Irish language (Irish Gaelic) books and periodicals.
        Very pleasant place.

A Remainder & Used bookstore (Chambers btwn Broadway & 8th)
        Called Harry's or Barney's or something similar. Prices are
        great but ratio of remainders to used books is very high.
        Lots of used paperbacks, if that's a lure.
        Note: this might actually be the following:

Ruby's Book Sale (119 Chambers)
        Really BARGAIN prices for books; many, many, NEW books in
        the $40-$100 range can be had here for $15-$25; one book
        I bought for my daughter was $47.95 NEW at Miller's (a
        riding shop) and was purchased at Ruby's for $12!

Science Fiction, Mysteries, and More (140 Chambers west of W Broadway)
        Opened June '92.  It will have readings and signings.  Details to
        follow as I get them.

Computer Book Works (25 Warren between Church and Broadway, 212-385-1616).
        They also run a BBS which you can access by dialing 212-385-2891
        with your modem.

Strand Books (South Street Seaport, 212-809-0875)
        Nowhere near as large as the one on Broadway.  Open seven days a
        week 10 AM-10 PM.

Isaac Mendoza's (used) (2nd floor loft above Ann near City Hall)
        They have the best selection of used hardcover science
        fiction in town, by far.  They are also strong in a number
        of other categories and their prices are reasonable -- I
        saw a copy of THE ICEMAN COMETH inscribed by Eugene O'Neill
        there once, for $25.

Rizzoli's (World Financial Center) (212-385-1400)
        Probably the premier art book store in the city.  Lots of
        fun stuff, also foreign books + periodicals
        A classy place, strong on art books.
        Opulent bookstore specializing in art/architecture/design
        books.
        Italian Bookstore chain.  Excellent art, design, and
        architecture sections.  New books at list prices.
        If you like glossy art books at full price try Rizzoli's.
        (Also has an uptown and downtown store, and they have opened
        up a branch in Bloomingdale's 59th & Lexington Avinue.  They
        also have stores in Boston, Chicago, Costa Mesa and
        Williamsburg.

Waldenbooks (59 Broadway south of Wall St.)
        Very strong on finance.  Reasonably strong on everything else.

Also, there are lots of specialty bookstores, usually around each of
the colleges and universities in the area (Columbia, NYU, St. Johns,
CUNY, and so on).

There used to be "The Bookstore Book" (subtitled "A Guide to Manhattan
Booksellers") by Robert Egan, published by Avon.  It listed over 750
bookstores, categorized by type of store and subject area, with several
useful indexes.  Unfortunately it was published in 1979, and is probably
somehwat out-of-date.

Of course, were it not for history, Tom Mandel's name would be Oscar
Pullerman. And my grandfather's name was changed at his adoption from
Emerald Ambrose McMahon to Emerald Ambrose Silliman (he never much cared
for the Emerald Ambrose part either, signed his initials and called
himself "Bud"). And two of my favorite poets in the world are Carolyn
Hall Ochs and Mary Korkegian.

Ah yes, but you gotta think that it's the way "culture" is going,
i.e., at one point in time, I'm always amazed to read, someone who
graduated from a University had mastered a "controlled" universe of
texts, the classical texts in the original, texts of the national
literature, a consisten range of "major" philosophical works.

Of course, we don't have this any more.

And as you point out, the texts have spread beyond grasp. Nonetheless,
these _are_ texts and I can think of exapmles where I've cited the
list or Susan Herring's incredible work on gender-based list
discuorse. (See EPC documents/conversatiosn for this paper.) But the
fact that they have spread doesn't mean they don't have spirit!


Let's work on a million words...

It has nothing to do with the French (unless we're specifically talking
about French politics), but everything to do with daily life. One major
reason that Russian poetry has continued to hold its strong connection
to an oral tradition (Ilya Kutik and Ivan Zhdanov rhyme more often than
not, and Zhdanov can recite his poems with his eyes closed for an hour
at a time without pausing) is, as Ilya points out, because in their
history and context "paper is very expensive."

The idea (popular on the CAP-L list I believe) that American poetry is a
tributary of British literary history -- rather than, say, that British
literature is just one of many wonderful roots in the thick stew of our
literary origins -- is a complex and specific history of political
domination made tangible even in the tongues we speak.

I admit to being shocked at the neo-Luddite position. There certainly is
an approach to politics that can be a mystification, as there can be to
poetry (viz. so many of Susan Howe's readers or the worrying over
skipped anapests among the new formalists, or -- I fear, not having seen
the film yet -- the recent deification of Jim Carroll).

The history of the 20th century teaches perhaps only one lesson and that
is that to ignore one's sense of history and politics at any given
moment is to surrender one's life -- too often literally -- to the
politics of another. From Armenia to Auschwitz to Kampuchea to Bihac to
Rwanda. Dubravka Djuric is half serb and half croat. She writes for an
identity and people that cannot now logically exist. Can you tell me
that that tragedy is not real and that it does not affect poetry?

Or consider how the history of homophobia informs every word, every line
of Jack Spicer's poetry. Or even O'Hara's. Or how the distinction
between the two can be organized around their relative class stances.

What you been smokin', Ed?

Despite the long list of bookstores, I tend to agree that there are few
who would have the books talked about on this list, or a large selection
of books carried by SPD. St. Mark's, yes. A severe loss was when The
Bridge moved away several years ago, and now it's owner, David Abel, is
in Albuquerque with a new & fine book store, Passages.

One important treasure in New York left off the long list was Printed
Matter, carrying visual books, artists' books, and more (not much poetry
within that, but some, and some experimental music). It's in SOHO, but I
don't have the address at hand. Worth a visit.

to speak in defense of lowtech librarianship--one of my prized
possesions is a complete set of Duncan's HD Book, assembled w/
the help of Cleveland State (hardly a major research library)
and interlibrary loan--the hardest part of assembling it, several
years ago, was finding the references.

convert paper into bytes (personal attestament).  which why am

Dear Anyone in NYC,

   I'd like to do a bit of personal whining in regards to bookstores in NYC.
I've recently been told by Elanine Equi that my new book - published by Sun
and Moon and therefore distributed by Consortium, out since mid-February -
has not appeared at St. Mark's or any bookstore she knows of downtown. Books
and Co. uptown supposedly has it, but...really. So either having this
slightly more prominent publisher/distributor on your side doesn't really
help much or , well, maybe it's just me. What can I say? Life's a big
disappointment.

Yours,

Lindz Williamson recently wrote: "I acknowledge the shit in my ancestor's
history
and believe that it should never be forgotten, but I will not kiss anymore
ass to compensate for being born white."

Canada is a very different place than the U.S., I have a feeling, and there
are also many different places within the U.S.  But off of University
campuses in the U.S. and outside of large liberal-leaning U.S. cities, there
is nothing like a "PC movement" going on.  What there is is a fear that PC is
coming from these "horrible" places (as reported in the mainstream press to
all of the country) to take over all of our lives.  "Acknowledging the shit
in our history", for most U. S. Americans, is seen as the equivalent of
"kissing ass."  Resurrecting old biases is confused with strength.  One
representation of this is how the several announced Republican challengers
for the Presidency are not being referred to in diminutive forms, as were the
Democratic (problematic, but more sensitive) challengers four years ago:
remember the media characterization of "the seven dwarfs"?  The rhetoric of
not kissing any more ass is what fires the campaigns and the coffers of the
major conservative candidates, gives them strength and stature.  We beat
those Indians in a war, didn't we, so why are we cowering now?  Another
manifestation of this is that I'm at a small college where the Dean is openly
opposing the starting of an interdisciplinary Ethnic and Gender Studies
program (we have no Woman's Studies, African-American Studies, Native
American Studies, Asian-American Studies, nor does hardly any college in the
state of Wisconsin outside the major UW campuses), saying that we're
preaching "pluribus without the unum."  The plain assumption is that once we
had traditions which made fair and honest judgments and that revisionists are
perverting these.  A history that doesn't support this comfortable version of
the past is called, again our Dean's word, "divisive."  We mustn't ruffle the
egos of our male business students.

Things might be different in Canada.  Here in the states, we're moving
quickly back toward the right and backlash against the characterization of PC
hegemony is much stronger than any real addressing of the problems of social
inequity/inequality.  And come on, LindZ, has your Scotch etc. ancestry ever
prevented you from getting a cab at night, or a bank loan?  I'm Irish-German
with a tiny part Jew (baptised Presbyterian, practicing atheist) and I when I
entered my thirties (and started a full-time job) all of a sudden everyone
was treating me exactly how I heard white men were always treated and had
doubted when I was in grad school and feeling disenfranchised: with an
uncomfortable amount of deference.  Bankers are smiling at me like I'm their
friend, knowing absolutely nothing about me, just by looking at me!  (A
revulsed shudder runs through me.) It's another aspect of racism, to my mind:
I'm being judged not by who I am, but by what I look like, who others picture
me as according to surface characteristics.  This is the very same lesson,
ultimately, as is seen in Ralph Ellison's _Invisible Man_ (recommended by
Kali Tal on this list long ago): we are all still judged by such visible
characteristics.  Or as W.E.B. DuBois wrote a century ago, the glare that
people of color get walking through middle America remains the same, a stare
which asks, "How does it feel to be a problem?"

In a time when there's shrinking opportunities (like the fact that I will
never have the cushy jobs my grad school profs did), it's comfortable to say
that past inequities have been addressed, if only because we've all been
lowered to the worst possible level.  But I have a student (black) who ALMOST
escaped the worst projects in Chicago, started a class with me this semester
and is now sitting in jail (and because of overcrowding is in with some of
the worst prisoners in the state).  He's no saint, but I've known or seen
white students who've done just about every illegal thing in the book and not
ended up in jail.  His speech is black, his dress is black, his circumstances
are black -- these signs all help put him in a Wisconsin jail.

No one's asking you to feel guilty.  I don't feel guilty.  But if I haven't
had advantages, I haven't had disadvantages either.  Where does this feeling
you've been "kissing ass" come from?  Could you give examples of how you've
had to kiss ass?  It sounds to me like the same rhetoric I hear from my
thoughtless rural white freshman students who don't want to be bothered with
anything that will stand in between them and their (economic) goals,
including concern for the less advantaged or a history that doesn't conform
to their images of themselves.  I'm not asking you to feel guilty, I'm just
wondering where this feeling that you're being threatened comes from, if it
isn't a dominant cultural position you feel is under attack, even if you're
not yet acknowledging it to yourself.

In-Reply-To:  <199504131747.KAA28594@>

        Dear Tom,
        To accept the world is to change it.
        In other words, I don't believe it's a question of acceptance or
change. You can emphasize one or the other in yr discourse. But you're not
going to have that much of either in life if you don't opt for both.
        By the same token, I'd say I'm arguing for acceptance as much as
change in this little discussion we're having. I'd say that the pervasive
denial one encounters regarding the power issue is a refusal to accept the
way things are, a refusal to face reality.
        When there's less denying and more facing up to the reality we
live in, then people will talk about these things more and other things
will happen (some of which we can't imagine or predict) that will lead to
significant change. In the meantime, we don't really have acceptance or
change. Not enough to satisfy me, and it shouldn't be enough to satisfy
you either.
        Don't know what else to say, except that you can address me as you
wish, whatever you're in the mood for is fine with me. (Never meant to
imply otherwise.)
        Yrs, Spencer

Folks,

   An essential component in racist discourse
is the 'ethinic' absence 'whiteness.' The multi-
cultural map - the PC map - is all too often plotted
without accounting for 'white ethnicity' (James
Clifford's term, in Sulfur 32). The result is an
implicit designation of 'whiteness' as the norm -
as that which need not be accounted for, or for
that metter, need not be held accountable (for itself,
it's own constructions, the way 'ethnic' identities are)
either.


   Ron's assertion that homophobia invariably
informs the poetics of Spicer and O'Hara (think also
of Duncan), addresses the matter in terms of sexuality,
implying, as it does,  that heterosexuality informs
the poetry of, for instance, an Olson or Creeely (as it
so obviously, and insistently, does). The problem is that
where O'Hara is a homosexual poet (or Lorde is an African -
American poet, Brathwaite a Carribean poet, Alarcon a
Chicano poet, etc.), Creeley is just a poet. The discrepenmcy
is elementary.

   I remember Rachel Blau Du Plessis posting a call
for papers on this list re: a panel on constructions of
whiteness (at the MLA, was it?), and would be interested
in hearing about what people are coming up with. Around here-
aside from James Clifford - Andrew Maxwell does a radio
program that features 'Whiteness On the Installment Plan,'
a quite poetic (and often comic) commentary/ critique that
catechristaiclly uses the trope(s) of whiteness in a very
successful, explorative way. A related piece by a psuedonymed
Maxwell was published electronically in DIU a few issues ago.

   Anybody else trying this one on?

not in any way to defend corporate bookstores or the massmarket/
lowest-common-denominator culture they reflect & perpetuate...

nor to deny the frustration of trying to work w/in that system...

but it _do_ reinforce the importance of networks of individuals
(ov which this list maybe is a piece) that can pick up the slack.
seems i saw yr book (_Made To Seem_, $9.95 frm Sun & Moon, 6026
Wilshire Blvd., LA CA 90036--maybe one of you newyorkers will
order it thru one of the offending bookstores?) on the list of
several folk's "bedside readings" a few weeks ago--better to be
read by an appreciative folks than picked blind by some bookbuyer
on the basis of who-knows-what?

to use yr own (frm ibid):

      SIT-CALM

   In the excitement phase
   we think we want something
   we're made up to seem
   exaggeratedly unfit for,
   say, touch.

   This is the funny part
   but also the dangerous
   moment.  Right away
   we're talked out of it--
   no harm done--
   by a band of wise-acre friends

  "I don't know
   what I'm thinking," we say,
   to a spike of merriment.
   Here is the warm
   human part
   which dissipates tension


we _aren't_ unfit for touch, our books _aren't_ unfit reading;
but if commercial success is the measure, we _think_ that's what we want.
and i count myself a wise-acre, trying to talk us out of
using their yardstick, substituting instead the warm human part
that is community... for the situation comedy/commodity

If I understand the sense of the term "voice" you're using, it seems like
you're conflating "content" and "form" in there.  (Sorry to use such
old fashioned terms in response to a posting quoting Deleuze &
Guattari.)  & I still think that you can use your "voice" to talk about
anything, using a variety of structures.

Yes, there is a tendency for readers to presume that a poet or any kind of
artist will pretty much continue in the same vein.  And, yes, it's hard
for a writer (or etc.) to fight this prejudice on the part of readers.

Still, thinking back over the range of poets who get name-checked on this
list, there's a hell of a lot of this kind of shifting that's gone on and
been more or less accepted.

I've known Larry Ochs (who for those on the list who don't know, is the
"O" of the ROVA Saxophone Quartet & a very good musician and composer) for
about twelve years and I'd be pretty surprised if he were in fact related
to Phil Ochs.  It's not something I'd even thought to ask, so I could be
wrong, but Phil seemed a little too WASPy (to tie this in to the white
ethnicity thread) for this to be the case.

&, Speaking of which, Good Yom Tov (which I've never typed before and
just realized is a bit redundant though idiomatically correct) for those of
you who live where the sun has already gone down.

I think I saw an article in Coda (you know, Canada's jazz magazine, not

For that matter, I think Bill Smith, one of the editors of Coda, moved to

Subject:      Mail before Malls!

Half of all the books in the US are bought through the mails. A lot of
that includes professional books (and a book of poems is, I would argue,
a curious category of the professional book, as are all those tomes on
how to study for your real estate exam).

Forty percent of all books sold in the US are romance novels.

What's the difference between an airport bookstore and a Dalton's? (Some
airports, like Portland's, have consciously modeled their commercial
spaces after the territorial impulses of the mall and done a pretty good
job mimic-ing the form. I can imagine locals going there to shop.)

SPD in Berkeley (one block from my house) is not so much a bookstore as
a distribution warehouse that uses its front nominally as a bookstore as
a conscious (and money-losing) service to local readers. The real
business is the catalog.

East of SPD, the only poetry bookstore that I've ever been in that I
would call great is Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee -- easily the best
poetry bookstore as bookstore in the USA. Anne Kingsbury and Karl
Gartung and their friends have done an amazing job in a city that people
do not automatically think of as one of the major writing centers. But
if you want to see what a good poetry collection might look like, that's
the model I'd recommend.

Then there are bookstores like Black Oak Books in Berkeley, which
militantly refuse to carry language poets on the grounds that "language
poetry is puke."

Subject:      The Impulse to Stock Things

Rae's post about bookstores, noted in reference to her new book (which I
really loved, by the way!) brings to mind a general complaint--perhaps a
seconding of what she says ('though not, I realize, intended as a motion!).

There seems, even among our fine independent bookstores in these parts (SW
US) a disinclination to go after new poetry books or  books on poetics, even
those with Small Press Distribution.  The whose issue seems to have a big
vacancy sign posted before it.
Certain standard, known commodities, are customarily planted onthe shelves,
typically the books being taught in some class at the University.  No harm in
that except the exclusivity.

One store here has elected to go with a section of Arizona poets (of which
there are many), but the contact person informs me that it's "Tough to get
the books," (mine and everybody else's) even when they are supposedly
available through SPD.

I have no idea as to the accuracy of the alleged difficulty. And I'm not
picking on SPD.  My message is that there seems no point of origin in any
potential transaction.  Bookstores here and other places do nott routinely
seek to order what I would consider pretty vital offerings (Rae's book, say,
for one).  There's a sort of lethargy.  More and more, it's a matter of
merely ordering the sure things.

In my own case, I've found it somewhat disconcerting when asked by friends
who live not primarily in any literary realm, but people who have an interest
in, say, just strolling in to Border's or Changing Hands and picking up a
book of mine.  They ask, logically enough, "Where can I get your books?"
 Well, I have to do this shuffle. I may say "Border's SHOULD have
them...maybe Changing Hands does.  I'm sure that either place will special
order if they're out."   Let's just say that  I'd like to be sure!

I've never had the intention of running a bookstore out of my office or
house.  Naturally, I take books along to readings.  But there's nothing very
easy or natural about the commerce of the everyday in this.

I use myself as an example.  But putting me in the place of the customer, I
have to go through many hoops, as do most people on this list, I suspect,
just to get hold of something that interests me.  It's as though it is a
treasure hunt to find some books.  The treasure part is nice. The hunt is not
my preference!

I tend to order from someplace that distributes, or from presses directly.
 But it would be great to walk into a place, and equally to the point, to
have people who don't already know some of this stuff, to walk into a place
and have access to what we're doing.  Too much explanation, too much
shuffling, has to precede a simple question.

A frustration, not one that can't be solved, I'm sure.  I've done SOME work
on it, but have had to place a higher priority on making a living and
creating works.

geezus, herb, i hope to hell i haven't been conflating form/content, esp.

look:  by 'voice' i'm referring to a set of rhetorical conventions, accepted

from folks regarding how/why a move away from identity politics isn't
in so many ways (or is it?) reflected in a move away from 'voice' as such...
now this consistency that is taken to be 'voice' can take different *forms*...
but i'm interested esp. in the construct, not the specific form (and by "form"
here i mean nothing like the form/content split to which you refer)...

i learned just yesterday, after posting this question to the list, that this

portland oregon (earlier this week)... in terms of more avant garde practices,
one might have thought this had died with the new left... but not so---i yet

Rae and others,

Rae, you are not alone in your unavailability in NYC. I have done the
covers for Bruce Andrews' last two "perfect bound" books--_Tizzy Boost_
(The Figures, 1993) and _Divesture-A_ (Drogue, 1994). Bruce and I
constantly lament the fact that these books are nowhere available
commercially in _our_ home town. Both  are "distributed" by SPD. We often
think how nice it would be for one of our friends to walk in to a NYC
bookstore and just happen upon our work. Instead, they (as we all do)
receive them through the mail gratis--which is nice, if you're on the
right mailing list...

Someone brought up the idea of compensation for our work. Rae, if you
wanted better distribution, would it kill you (i.e. any of us on the
list) financially to send a text file of your *latest*  and make it
available to all via EPC? I mean, let's face it, has anyone ever really
made money on publishing their latest book of poetry?


Peace,

yes. i wrote something on Bob Kaufman's "Bagel Shop Jazz" that talks about the
golden triangle of outsiders the poem portrays --women, Jews and Blacks --part
of my paper treats, following David Roediger's arguments in The Wages of
Whiteness and The Abolition of Whiteness, that ethnic immigrant groups had to
become white when they arrived, in order to have access to privileges such as
civil rights, state protection, etc.  So that, for instance, Jack Kerouac and
Allen Ginsberg are "white," but their parents or their parents' parents had had
to become white.  (part of roediger's thesis --he'a a labor historian --is that
when immigrants arrived they were given whiteness to compensate for their
extreme poverty-level jobs).  there's no such given as whiteness, though white
people often take their privilege for granted, not recognizing it as such.  see
also ruth frankenberg's White Women, Race Matters (U of Minnesota Press, 1993).

Thanks Ted. I was wondering when someone would make your very neccessary point.
     That this is still a contested postion in the States is revealed by
Limbaugh, who said something to the effect that there is no record of genocide
in the U.S. and as proof suggested we look at census reports. Pretend this
is a Where's Waldo sort of exercise: how many logical fallacies can you find
in that?
     Another thing, it is not liberal handwringing to notice.

Poetry may contain or be conditioned by numerous factors like
politics, sexuality, nationality, etc. but what "saves" any
given poem *as a poem* is not reducible to any one factor,
or ensemble of factors. The argument becomes one against
reductionism.

Subject:      The Impulse to Stock Things (longish)

Seems as if we in England share your distribution problem. Approximately 15
years ago the number of bookshops prepared to stock little or small press
books (particularly if not perfect bound) dramatically declined. The
financial imperative as described re SPD dominated the market dry.

The problems of product placement  --  if and under what circumstances at
all  -- sale or return  --  deteriorating or damaged goods -- sliverish
profit margins -- shrinking risk  --  author-subsidized publishing --
threshholds of marketability ossifying into unfortunate and ultimatetly
divisive 'star' status if not outright hierarchies of self-perpetuating
(sometimes at the least colluded in) hit names of given generations or
'movements' -- regressive cultural 'cold war' hegemonies freezing out the
awkward -- and more, have all been discussed or somehow raised over the
past few weeks.

The situation impinged so drastically onto poetry publishing here that the
number of active book series and small magazines collapsed. Books were
being produced, often although not exclusively, in tiny xerox editions
(50-100) circulated directly amongst friends and peers as social gifts.

One result has been to render much of the most interesting writing done
here in the past fifteen years all but invisible. The New Curious (not
necessarily but often young) find it close to impossible to get hold of any
of the work. Even libraries and archives must have a strange shelf reading
'vacant pending' for British poetries circa 1979-93 (these dates are by no
means brittle). That situation is only recently beginning to change. By the
same token how many US poets have been published much here in that time
frame and vice versa compared to in the previous decade and a half.

There is one shop (Compendium) in London with a very small selection of
contemporary poetry of any significance. Current US writers are represented
by a nominal 'hard-core' who sell.

A recent overview article on English poetry by Charles Bernstein in Sulfur
attests to the 'power' of the published book as being seen to signify
presence and activity for a poet. An interesting enough provocative
criteria. You might be reading and performing widely for example and yet
not considered  -  unless a published artefact identifiable as being
authored by you could be objectified. Now I find this very intriguing.
Especially in the light of Rae's recent post about the unavailibility of
her most recent book, especially when that book is a Sun & Moon / SPD
distributed product. (yes I've noticed the doubts cast onto those
validations too).

There is a need to break out of the reductive cycles and circumstances into
which we continue to buy. As several have suggested right here.

Ron is right when he says that direct mail works. It does so primarily for
those with the money to pursue their interest and/or for they who know what
they want and pretty much know what they're going to get. Sheila's also
right when she wants the possibility, at least, of someone who doesn't
already know what they're looking for to just pick up her book or Rae's or
anybody's on this list and others beyond in a bookstore - be excited or
intrigued enough to buy it and the rest, as is said, is herstory.

I don't have any answers but I do have a simple suggestion which this list
can further facilitate. Books are already advertised for direct purchase on
the list and the work quoted from here (yes I know it's rudimentary and
unsatisfying for a lot of work for many reasons but we should stick with it
and work on making the environment here as flexible and accessible as
possible (I'm just as  e-literate as many others here I would guess and I'd
love to learn quickly or have someone else do the slog for me but  -  I had
to learn to write and here I go again). Books are already archived in the
EPC (as offered) and the relevant order information can be appended. It's
my sense that a constructive inter-relationship is to be encouraged between
electronic publishing and printed matter.

Given all of that how about product exchange? Now I realise right away that
this only makes any kind of sense when distances between presses and / or
distribution 'territores' are large. On suitable negotiated bases both
books and CDs, at least, could be simply SWAPPED to equivalent value.
Instead of me selling 300 copies of a chap I'd sell 200 and then swap 100
for chaps by others and sell those. (amounts could be small - like anything
from 3 - 25 copies). I know many will throw up their hands in horror (but
then how will they catch them when they drop) seriously -

Advantages:

-   each our books are made available / accessible to a wider audience
-   sometimes it's easier to push someone else's book than your own
-   the range of books on a stall at a reading / performance series (or
whatever) can feel very much like a celebration of strength and depth
without competition (solidarity) and dare I say (sorry Lisa) more 'groovy'
-   problem of buying sight unseen via direct mail is obviated, people can
see the poems
-   we several all have a wider stock
-   reactivates those attic box fulls.
and others I haven't time to articulate right now.

I'm naive enough to feel that a small version of such a scheme is worth trying.
I'm also experienced enough to know that this way pratfalls lurch BUT -
It's how the Recommended network of record labels operated for best part of
10 years in western europe. I know because I helped out. Such schemes are
bound to have a life length appropriate to their usefulness.

Or to translate Spencer:

To accept the world is to be changed and to thereby change the world.
This process is a generative discourse.
Exchange at all levels and for all purposes is part of this process.

any thoughts? yours  -  the space cadet for tonight
and before everyone reaches for their hot response key / I'm aware that
much of these issues skirt into some of the questions being raised re -
this space and it's potential and how each reads here and so on and I'm
going to try to post something on that tomorrow

Subject:      Dissemination (long)

Dear Cris:
     Many, many thanks for your informative "history chunklette" of
English distribution/poetry dissemination. Want to point out something:
Sun & Moon's primary distributor isn't actually SPD, but Consortium, here
in St. Paul. It's an important distinction because the failure of
Consortium to get (say) Rae's new Sun & Moon book into NYC bookstores is
much more eyebrow-raising than would be SPD's. SPD doesn't have any "field
reps," though Steve Dickison maybe visits a few stores a year and pitches
a couple of tiles. SPD isn't technically a distributor: they're a
"warehouser," meaning, you go to them first, not the other way around.
Consortium, however, which carries only some 2 dozen presses (those the
size of Sun & Moon, Coffee House, & Serpent's Tail/High Risk), has at
least 15 "field reps" scattered throughout the country. Twice a year
Consortium holds a "sales meeting." Someone from Sun & Moon, Coffee House,
Serpent's Tail, etc. comes out with their list for the next "season," and
pitches their list to the reps, who in turn pitch the books to various
bookstores, often using the publisher's original pitch.
     I sat in on one of the "Consortium prep" marketing meetings at Coffee
House and I'm here to tell you: Ain't no way to pitch a book of poetry to
Consortium unless (a) it's an anthology of some sort, especially if it has
a topical "theme"; (b) the book is by one of the "currently hot" ethnic
groups (books by Asian and African Americans are "currently hot"--meaning,
the two ethnic groups general readers are currently buying a good number
of books by-- don't mean to offend anyone; if the "currently hot" ethnic
groups were Irish and German American, I'd use the same terms); (c) "sex,
anyone?" (including anything involving some or several issue(s) of
"gender"); or (d) "Didn't you used to president, Mr. Carter?"  (famous
people who decide to "give poetry a go"--double entendre definitely
intended.)
     A Consortium rep has 30 seconds (I swear I was given precisely that
figure) to pitch a book, any book, to Mr. or Ms. Bookstore Stocker, and
while *no* book--in my opinion--can be pitched (or dismissed) in that
amount of time, that's what most books get today. (Fun, isn't this?) Oh!
Here's a Fun Anecdote for Rae: The book Coffee House was having trouble at
that time coming up with a pitch for was Elaine Equi's _Decoy_, for which
Rae wrote a quite- readable-in-30-seconds blurb. As nice as your blurb
was, Rae, it was apparently not "pitchable" by Coffee House/Consortium
standards. "Well," someone at the meeting said, "Elaine's going to be *at*
this meeting, so we can't give Consortium our usual 'It's poetry; do what
you can' speech." (Poets, go back over that sentence again.) "We'll have
to come up with something." They didn't come up with anything while I was
around, so I can't tell you what they wound up saying.
     If Rae's book is not in stores in NYC, I assume it's because the
person pitching Rae's book for Consortium didn't have anything to say
about the book (in 30 seconds or less) to suggest it would sell very well
("Rae Armantrout used to be Quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys!")
Sure, *we* like Rae's work (I just finished _Extremities_,
Rae--wonderful!--I know it's "old," but wonderful all the same) but, if
you're like me--and I know *I* am-- you don't work for Consortium.
     Bookselling in this country is too depressing to think about, except
that we *have* to think about it, because that's what some of us do. Not
only that, but it's not just about selling books, it's about disseminating
information, ideas, points-of-view, ways of experiencing (knowing) the
world (or "the word"). One reason my eyebrows don't "do-the-wiggly"
reading about censorship-advocates like [insert name of backwater GOP
running for congress next election year] is because the truth is: The
"market" has and will continue to be the Primary Censorship Agency in this
country. Not the *only* one, mind you. But, sort of the "Elvis-elect" of
censoring bodies, if you will. ("Elect" 'cause we "asked" for this-
-consent of the governed, & all that.)
     Consortium exists by virtue of Bookslinger, the latter of which used
to be in Minneapolis, & was every bit as big, carried as many titles &
presses, as SPD. (I know, I used to frequent both.) Consortium, in fact,
is in good part responsible for Bookslinger's demise in 1993. Bookslinger
had a lot of problems, but some of its biggest problems were the people
who started Consortium AND DID SO IN THE OFFICES OF BOOKSLINGER. The
Consortium people used to WORK AT Bookslinger. Then, they thought:  "Say,
what if we took a dozen of them best-selling ding-dang presses, and
started a NEW distributing company to FOCUS ON THEM?"  They did that,
using Bookslinger's office space, computer, paper, supplies--AND PAID FOR
NONE OF IT. Then, when things "got rolling"  they moved out into their own
office and started a new policy: ALL OTHER DISTRIBUTORS WANTING BOOKS ON
PRESSES WE CARRY HAVE TO GET THEM FROM *US* AND *NOT* THE PRESS ITSELF.
AND THEY HAVE TO *PAY* FOR IT, TOO.
     In other words, gang, Consortium ultimately wound up TAKING AWAY
Bookslinger's biggest accounts, AND THEN MADE THEM PAY FOR IT!  Ask SPD,
anyone, where they get their Sun & Moon books, their Coffee House Press
books--from Sun & Moon? From Coffee House? No, no, no. You're not thinking
"mafia." You're not thinking "extortion." You're thinking "consent of the
governed." Think, for a moment, "Hegemony." Now, care to wage a few bucks
on it? Well, you're "right on the money" if you said, "Gary, I'll wager
they get them darn books from the friendly PIRATES at CONSORTIUM, and they
PAY A LITTLE 'SERVICE CHARGE' FOR 'EM, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.") DING!
DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!
     (Excuse that outburst. I read a lot of Lester Bangs as a teen.)
     Bookslinger had a lot of problems. They never established nonprofit
status, had to rely on a "fiscal receiver" for what grants they did get, a
fiscal receiver in fact that didn't-- reportedly--"like" "them" "very"
"much." Consequently, they (sit down for this one people) *had* *to*
*rely* *on* *book* *sales* *to* *keep* *in* *business*. (My apologies for
those of you w/weak hearts.) They were also horribly, horribly
disorganized. (Walking into their offices, I always assumed I was back in
the Bay Area, & there had been a massive quake.) But, Consortium put the
final nail into Bookslinger's coffin. Or, that's one opium-eating, lake-
staring-at, frail & timid, longhaired, velvet-suit-wearing poet's opinion,
anyway.
     So. Cris, your idea of exchanging a number of books w/a number of
other publishers is not *only* a good one, it's one Marta & I've been
practicing now for a while, first with Karl Roessler & his Trip Street
Press (two lovely books available; I'll plug them later in a separate
post) and, just recently, with Spencer Selby & his SINK Press (who, if

Coincidentally rec'd in the mail yesterday a tape from
a comrade in england, it's
david henderson singing, circa 1975, "Love In Outer Space"
accompanied by Sun Ra arkestra. What an incredibly smooth voice!
Really, one of the lovliest singing voices I've heard in
a long time, 'specially from a dude. I wonder what he'd have
to say about being left out of most a dem antologies...

The other side of the tape is Baraka & Arkestra, performing
Baraka's righteously afrocentric "A Black Mass", which is published
in one of the collections of his dramatic works. The recording
is from nineteen sixty eight and it is eentense. jacoub!


Bob Kaufman, "the best poet," wore khakis too



Stroffolino probably wore khakis.

speaking of whom, Chris, Sonny Ochs, Phil's brother, is an
elementary school teacher somewhere up here near Albany. She co-hosts
the "Mostly Folk" radio program on WRPI late sunday afternoon/
early evening. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but Larry Ochs
(who played on that splendid Camper Van Chadbourne lp, _the eddie
chattebox double trio love album_, i think) has roots in the
Ochs family at the New York Times.


why does it fascinate me that Lyn & Rae have more than one name?

        I thank you for your response and agree that things in canada and
the Us are ertremmly different.  My father's side of the family is based
in Oregon, making in me painfully aware of the world of differencein
attitudes.  As well being on the west coast there isnot a large black
population.  Most of the friends that I have that are black are refugees
from Ethiopia and they do not contian the America Black attitude that is
defined as a "black thing" (meaning language, dress,, music).  Mostlikely
this is why they have escaped the discrimination that Afro-American often
receive.
        However, being on the west coast brings up a another issue
of discrimination from the  Asian population.  But being Asian typically
carries the stereotype of being less "agressive" and "twice as intelligent" as
say the Afro'Americans, therefore they would not face the same sort
discrimination.
        And what I mean by not kissing ass any more refers to Canadian
history, not American.  I'm talking about instances such as the Japanese
internment, Chinese head taxes, refusal to admit Jewish war refugees in
WWII while German war criminals hide out in Toronto and Vancouver, banning
of the potlatch, and so forth.  All these things were in my history texts
and acknowledged as crimes against humantity, so there is no need for me
to feel guilty ( although it does pain to walk to Pigeon park on Welfare
wednesday and see Indians shooting up on junk, and I can't help but think
this in not natural, not the way things are supposed be), I can't apologize.
I will wear my heart on my sleeve and put forth extra effort to clean up
the mess that has been created for me and my generation, but saying sorry
does not help anyone.

I have conflicting ideas on the issues of the availability of books in
bookstores in NYC and elsewhere. Chax books are also distributed by SPD,
and one, by Kathleen Fraser, was reviewed by NY Times Book Review,
Village Voice, & elsewhere, and was still, according to reports I got,
largely unavailable in NY. So, yes, it hurts. On the other hand, I hate
to defend the market economy, but I do recognize that it exists, and part
of me wonders why so many people even expect bookstores to be
intellectual service organizations, rather than businesses. The exception
Ron Silliman pointed to, Woodland Pattern, is organized as a nonprofit
organization and is, in some ways, explicitly an intellectual service
center, and they could not possibly exist without individual, foundation,
corporate, and government contributions. That goes some way to explain
why they are the most fantastic poetry bookstore on the continent.

Stephen Cope mentioned that while O'Hara is a "homosexual" poet,
Creeley is just a poet. I dunno. I know people who thibnk of Creeley
as an American poet. I myself always think of him as a one-eyed poet.

But seriously, I do remember that about 20 years ago Ginsberg
descriobed my and Victor Coleman as good heterosexual poets. As it
was the first time anyone had called me that I was a little tripped,
and then I liked it. But I havent, I think, been called that by a
hetero-breeder poet, that I know of.

Still, I have heard O'Hara called a NY poet 200 times for every time
I have heard him called a gay poet. And Jack? Well, Jack is Jack. I
hold his imaginary hand.

Yes, Kenny, there is no distribution. Volume constraints on distribution
have increased over the past 15 years tothe point where some distributors
will not handle a book that has a print run of less than 5000 copies.
This institutionalization is recognized by everyone, but no one seems to
be willing or able to do anything about it.

I sent a long letter to several people involved with distribution, attempting
to suggest alternatives to the current system and no one was able to reply
with any support although all recognized that the current system of bookstores
and distributors does not service the literature only volume sales. For
example, The Nation magazine attempted to get Consortium to distribute 3000
copies of an anthology of articles from the Nation on race dating back to 1865,
a guaranteed seller. The Nation didn't have the captial to fund more than a
short run and Consortium turned them down saying they had to have 5000
copies to distribute.

This is obviously an absurd example of bad business
on the part of Consortium, but even SPD has a mandate as a wholesaler and
not a true distributor. SPD does not have sales reps that go to stores
and as a result their scope is limited. They do a good job in California
and some other places, but not in NY or other places where one needs a
rep to continuously barrage to stores. But the bookstores in NY are a
joke as well. They have no interest in anything but what they can sell to
unsuspecting college students. Even some of the "better" stores complain
they can't get service from smaller distributors. In fact the entire
distribution network has become so computerized and dependent on volume
for success that I have decided to try to sell texts on the net. But let
me ask a broacast question?

HOW MANY READERS OF THIS LIST WOULD ORDER A BOOK THROUGH THE MAIL?
HOW MANY WOULD ACCEPT AN ASCII FILE FOR 1/4 the price of a book?

I wonder. I have mailed many mailers to the Segue mailing list. MOst of
the people on this list are on the Segue list, but only 20 or tops 50
respond to a direct mail piece of a book they can't get in the stores. I
think our buying habits are sadly what determine our taste and are
conditioned by habit and consensus. I offered a list of the Segue catalog
to all these people for free, but only four were interested enough to request
it. (Oh and folks you will be getting it soon.)

We can blame the bookstores or blame computerization or blame THEM, but
in fact how many people will go one step out of their normal patterns to
get a book? A study of book buying indicates that some huge portion of
all books, 60%, purchased by a small portion, 10%, of buyers.

Anyway if there ever is an NEA again or any funding or private capital
for books, I hope small publishers get some relief on the market side.

Hank, I only caught your absolutely correct response of

and "In opposition is true friendship" is exact (tho,
for that matter, so is "opposition is true friendship").

As you know, the cruise has already been awarded. But, I

awarded it to him; I'm in a bind. Perhaps Gary would
be willing to share this historic vehicle.

I realize that I could also cut it in two lengthwise,
providing one of you with the driver's experience and
the other with that of a passenger. This would
accomplish the further goal of enriching retrospectively
the meaning of the phrase "split-window coupe."

What color would you like?

I don't know how you do it Gary. Informative and amazingly entertaining
post.
     We should perhaps add the problems of distributing not only books of
poetry but any marginalized cultural product. For instance, the late '80s
were an absolute renaissance for indy comics such as Love and Rockets,
Yummy Fur, and Jim, etc, but those of us that are interested are just now
beginning to get a sense of what all was available because most were
distributed to only two or three commix stores throughout the country.
We can get them now only because art spiegelman stirred up enough
interest with Maus that major commix pubs had to notice and in effect
bought out the indies. Now, they are available as back catalog items.
     Unfortunately, under current economic conditions, this seems to
be the only way to win the game of notice, but unfortunately it at the
same time kills the quality. The freedom that obscurity bought for the
indy comics guy is now gone and what is done now is hardly of the same
quality. Its a game that can't be won, unless, and this is the point of
my post, we develop our own distribution networks.
     The best of all possible worlds would be to combine Ron's and Rae's
concerns. Where those who know the stuff could direct mail and those who
don't can happen upon it. The only way I can see this happening is on the
net. Various catalogs could be made available and one could order stuff
while logged on (as you can do now on Prodigy, etc.) This network could be
placed on various gopher/www lists (like jewels) and in this way practically
anyone that has access to the net (admittedly a small group now but getting
larger) can have access to the books. This would then complement the
availability of e-books, which could in fact assist sales.
     A bit of wishful thinking, prob, but is anyone interested? Thanks, Eric.

What is politics? I remember one poet, after one of these many wrestling
matches about the issue, said in exasperation, "isn't what we are talking
about as politics your moral center?" Certainly we can argue over what
is moral, and why a center (snore), but I think she had something
important there. Something more than just         what happens when more
then two people get together, although this idea aknowledges politics as
taking place between the reader and the writer, as it should.
     The thing is that Republicans know art is political and that's why
they try to kill it. Only us and the Democratic party defend art
because they think it somehow above the political.
     Ultimately, if art is what some of us are saying: non-political,
amusement, transcendence, etc, then it is hard to justify. If art is this,
it deserves to be killed. I don't happen to think it is.
     Thanks ,Eric.

Curiously, at least to me, whiteness has, in America, been defined
negatively on most occasions; for example, when the Supreme Court has
found itself called upon to issue a definition of the white race, it has
generally chosen instead to explain why the person before them at the
time is non-white.  Look at Eric Sundquist's discussion of Plessy v
Ferguson, in which the novelist & lawyer Albion Tourgee argued that
Plessy had been unlawfully deprived of property, that property being his
reputation for being a white person (the courst agreed that Homer was not
white).

I sometimes have students who gripe that there isn't a white history
month or other such celebration of whiteness (though I don't get much of
this since the majority of students on my campus are legally defined as
non-white) -- It's not that old complaint that interests me; it's their
response when I treat the complaint seriously and ask them what the
contents of this whiteness might be.  Then it quickly becomes evident
that they want to have their whiteness and deny it at the same time.
That is, they insist, also, that they don't see things racially, that it
is all the non-whites who insist on continuing diviseness by forcing the
white students to view the world racially -- That they would point to any
number of cultural phenomena they believe the white race to have invented
(such as, the claim goes, the very idea of racial tolerance) but they at
the same time insist that none of these phenomena are constructed
"whitely" -- This _is_ indeed confusing,  What it amounts to is that
these students are angry that everyone is raced & ethnic but, supposedly,
themselves; but they insist that they don't see themselves as white
people;  I think that _is_ the remanant of white skin privilege in the
U.S. -- the right to decide when & where to become white.

Maria's work in this area, by the way, is well worth reading if you don't
already know it.  Also, & I may mangle the title here, Allen's _The
Invention of the White Race Vol. 1_.

A mag. with a title I detest, _Race Traitor_, sometimes has interesting
pieces on this topic, though its overall tone of "I'm more
counterhegemonic than you" is hard to take.

I've taught Frank O'Hara in my Ethnicity in Lit. class, and have even
floated a poem by my friend Spencer (Selby) in front of my students just
to trouble the waters --

Don't we all have more than two names??????  Even Sappho?????

before rusting &, besides, the Plymouth looks like an FBI vehicle. You do
the kinds of drugs necessary to "keep on top of" today's hip-now-with-it-
a-go-go music scene in a 'Vette, you're just asking for a tedious (&
need I mention recreational-drugless?) stay in Stillwater Prison.

But, seriously, give the 'Vette to Lazer. I'd just sell the the thing for
cigarettes, anyway...

   Dear Aldon--It's funny I saw a St. Patrick's day here in Albany and
   was kinda surprised how in 1995 there is still so much "ethnic pride"
   amongst whites...Like when I lived in philadelphia and shared an office
   space with a girl/woman (kinda transitional) who lived with her parents
   in South Phila. (highly ethnic italian and catholic and MUMMERS--do you
   know what MUMMERS are??????) and never left until she got married...and
   even then stayed there...Understanding such ethnic isolationism and
   the "tight communities" of whiteness came as a shock...especially during
   the year I lived in one of those ("white trash") neighborhoods and found
'  it more , er, disconcerting than living in North Phila. as only white
   guy on block....I was called "nigger lover" and had a couple of close
   calls with the locals...and this is much of what we're up against....

Hello to Ted Pelton and everyone else.

That list of NYC bookstores was great but out of date by at least two
years (some closings, some name-changes, etc).  Anyone coming to NYC
should feel free to e-mail me with particular interests (new? used?
antiquarian?) and I'd be happy to elaborate on possibilities.  I feel as
if I've worked in them all.

Anyway, here I am in NY and I'd guess I get most of my new stuff from SPD and
Moe's in California via on-line lists and catalogues.  They've got a web
site somewhere and are reachable through e-mail <moe@moesbooks.com> and
have a pretty strong poetry section.  The Grolier in Cambridge is also ok
for poetry but not consistent in what they'll stock.  The Gotham is also
great, if you can get over how rude half the staff is.  I was once on
hold for an hour and forty-five minutes and the person finally came back
and didn't even laugh or seem surprised that I was holding...

There are some great stores here, but yeah, you have to get used to the
idea that for the most part books are "stock" to the people you're
dealing with, in the new book trade.

Bye for now--(I was serious!  Feel free to e-mail for closer information)

In the late 1970s, I had a rare demo record of a session Lorenzo Thomas
did fronting a blues/rock band while in college (Queens? Brooklyn?).
The band was called The Bankers -- hard to imagine that image for
Lorenzo -- and he wrote the lyrics, sang the songs. I remember one
verse: "bedbug morning, silverfish afternoon."

The acoustics were dreadful but the music was out there. I got the
record from the bass player (Rich Jenkins, the younger brother of the
playwright Len whom Douglas has published on more than one occasion). I
gave my copy back to Lorenzo when I learned that he had lost the only
copy he had had.

My question: are there any other recordings of him w/ musicians out
there?

Just to fill in some of the story, no matter how removed and inaccurately
I am from it, I do believe Woodland Pattern began with a different name
and location, and that it was in part the brainchild of a group of
people, including Jerome Rothenberg who at the time was teaching at Univ.
of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, but also included quite prominently, Karl Young,
who has been tireless in his efforts to write, publish, review and
otherwise write about, and make available small press works. Karl Gartung
and Ann Kingsbury are to be praised for their vision and tireless work,
but there is a large degree to which Woodland Pattern began and still
exists as the vision of many, and one which unites a local community with
a much larger one via books and performances.

If you're in Milwaukee, Woodland Pattern is currently exhibiting an
exhibition, ART AND LANGUAGE: RE-READING THE BOUNDLESS BOOK, which was
originated in the spring of 1994 at Minnesota Center for Book Arts and
which has now been to Atlanta and Milwaukee. This exhibition must return
to artists after the current Milwaukee showing, but if anyone is
interested in book arts, art/language exhibitions, particularly as a
potential site host, please let me know, either via e-mail, or at
Minnesota Center for Book Arts, 24 North Third Street, Minneapolis, MN
55401. Phone 612-338-3634; fax 612-338-1562.

And thank you, Ron, for once again bringing Woodland Pattern to people's
attention.

        I have a question for the New Zealanders on the list: what was
the reception of _Once Were Warriors_ like there?  The movie has amazing
resonances here in Hawaii, but also elsewhere (the identifications with
African-American culture I found especially interesting).  Roger Ebert
got it comically wrong when he described it as a film about the evils of
alcoholism, when it's more about Maori oppression and internalized (and
externalized) rage.

        As for books, I order through the mail all the time.  We're on
the brink of having two Borders and a Barnes and Noble in Honolulu, but
the poetry selections are, shall we say, tame.  I'd be delighted to be
able to order through the net, or at least to have a catalogue of
available books on-line.

        I'm thinking of starting up a modest subscribers' only journal
(like _Situation_) that would concentrate on "experimental" writing,
especially that from the Pacific area, though not exclusively.  I'd be
delighted to get suggestions, about poets and about the mechanics of
getting a small journal going, from anyone through the backchannel.

        Thanks in advance,

Hi. Seems as if there are several suggestions re distribution surfacing or
re-surfacing. Good. Using this space operationally figures in all of them
so far.

James, I don't get the advantage of downloading ASCII from a middle-man. In
many (although I grant not all) cases I could get that direct from the poet
or have work posted to me via this space (which is increasingly happening).
Whereas I do the advantage of buying a hypertext work on disc direct from
say John Cayley or Kathryn Cramer or Jim Rosenberg. So, buying a disc which
present work in some way authored and designed for this e-space - yes.
Otherwise no.

As to Direct Mail it makes sense to use this listserv AND to
cross-reference several others such as Eric's suggestion of Jewels
(although I don't know what that is  -  doesn't matter at the present,
there may be many). I'm certainly more keen on an announcement accompanied
by examples from the work as in Juliana's or Kali's recent promo posts than
in merely a listing of available titles or a title plus a smoothe blurb
from anyone (which as far as I can see only fosters the perception of a
clique towards closure if we're talking about the curious browsing). But
then that's exactly the kind of possibility this e-space offers. I'm also
curious to hear from may others about Direct Mail preferences and
experiences.

Some (thanks gary and charles) have responded positively to the Timezone
Exchange (i don't know how should we refer to it?) suggestion and the next
step would be a bit of simple nuts and bolts on its mechanism?

It seems from my own access that the EPC is in need of some updating. Many
author cites are blank. But the EPC provides one exceptionally integrated
resource potential. A lot is down to us poets and publishers to learn the
formatting languages to facilitate the fully-dimensioned presentation of
our work(s).

Why do you find this curious, Aldon? I find it a confirmation of the
fact that race doesn't exist other than as a poltical creation (see,
for instance, Michael Omi and Howard Winant, _Racial Formation in the
US from 1960-1980_). (Whoa, politics!) "Blackness" has always been
defined as a "lack of pure whiteness", while "whiteness", for those
who care, only exists as the complete absence of "blackness". Thus,
a drop of "black blood" makes you "black". Only the absence of that
makes you "white". Not that there is any such absence, other than as a
fiction. I had a fight about this with some dufus on the Phil-Lit list
who insisted that during the entire 300 year Moorish occupation of
southern Europe, community standards prevented sexual relationships
between the occupiers and the occupied. Yeah, sure. We know what
happened here. As Sing Bird says in Toni Morrisn's _Song of Solomon_,
it's a wonder anybody knows who anybody is. Faulkner is the a master
teller of the story of the fiction of race. Check out _Light in
August_, _Absalom, Absalom_, and _Go Down Moses_.

Cris,

Are you using Web access or gopher? A commercial system? I don't think
there are any actual blank author locations. However, writing links
for the EPC tends to be highly labor intensive. The situation has been
that it all has to be done *twice* to support both gopher (Aol, etc.)
and web access. I mean we are talking _many_ hours of work. Given the
greater power and flexibility of the Web (and its near certain
movement towards being an Internet standard), I have tended to keep
those links active.

This creates a problem. Let those who can't access the web use gopher
and see an out-of-date version of the EPC (what, maybe 60% of it is
there via gopher) or eliminate that version (unfortunately then not
allowing some to contact?)

Anyway, I may have misinterpreted this part of your post. But that's
the only way I can figure you are finding empty author menus, since
the author area shouldn't have this.

All best,
Loss

having no modesty, i want to point to TapRoot at the EPC, which has a
WWW version underconstruction (150 short reviews indexed so far, about
10% of the backlog), and which might be a start.  the ordering information/
addresses point direct to the publisher--i always like to order direct,
puts more $$ back into the press.  and the intention is to add links from
the reviews to sample of work from the publications, tho copyright permission
details etc. have yet to be worked out.  and as ever, i'm actively soliciting
contributions of reviews...

In response to the recent posts concerning Woodland Pattern:

Before it was incorporated in 1979, it was known as "Books Books," which
began in the early seventies sometime ('72, '73?).  Much better for small
press books than anything I've seen in NYC or Chicago.  It was started in the
early 70s by Karl Gartung, Anne Kingsbury, Karl Young, Tom Montag, and Mark
Haupert (Jerome Rothenberg was not directly involved, though he may have been
teaching at UWM while "Books Books" began).  They do 40 or so public events
per year including readings, art openings, workshops, and music events.
Their ethnic literature sections are some of the more extensive I've seen
(very large Native American section), and their poetry selection has been
growing at a more than healthy pace since its beginning, so they have stuff
that even SPD doesn't have anymore.  They have catalogs available for their
ethnic literature collections (not for their poetry selection, it would be
too big).  AND, they have large collections of fine print books and
chapbooks.

They're tremendously dedicated to the Milwaukee community as well as keeping
up a world class literary center.

Speaking of dissemination -- a couple of guys are about to start up a
book distribution service for fiction.  You pay a nominal fee to put in
your manuscript.  Readers can read a few pages before making a decision
to order it, at which paying for the book with a computerized transaction
delivers the entire manuscript.  Authors get a royalty of a few dollars
apiece.  Sounds great, frankly.  Why only fiction?
Needs a server, some software, someone to put in a little time running it.

yes, mike, that's it: a is not marx. all language, it may be, is political (tho somewhat less so, i think, than some say), but it isn't that that makes the poem. spicer's joy in billy is a good deal more and other than relative class stance.

Yes, Chris. Ultimately I agree that the term moral center is a problem.
What I meant is something more like baseline ethics, or something similar.
     Marx's analysis of capitalism is only a criticism if we find
exploitation inethical.

Subject:      Hallmark

The late Darrell Gray, right after he got out of Iowa City, worked for
Hallmark in Kansas City for awhile before heading out to California. It
wouldn't surprise me to discover that other MFAers have done likewise. I
was in KC about 2 years ago, at the hotel that's attached to the
mall/office suite Hallmark runs (and rode past the very corporate block
architecture of its actual HQ building), and noted how the signage
referred to "the leading producer of greeting cards and social expression
products." That latter phrase stuck in my mind.

Beyond a verse genre that one could characterize in its sincere mode as
"lumpen new formalism" what I think causes the allergic reaction to
greeting cards is

(1) how greeting card verse instrumentalizes emotion into a lowest
(commodity) denominator. Whatever poetry does (and people do disagree on
that one, don't they?), almost every variation I've heard of tends to
discount instrumentalization (with the possible, and only just, exception
of certain identarian forms ("the people united...")).

(2) a reaction to how all poets must deal with the stereotypes of poetry
that non-readers (relatives, say, your great aunt or drunken uncle) throw
over one the minute they learn that you -- in whom everybody had once had
such hopes -- have decided, gasp, to devote a life to poems??!! You feel
misunderstood, ridiculed, violated in some fashion to hear your folks
make that sort of comparison and tend to blame the genre. No?

        I have to agree with what Chris was saying about white ethnic
communties such as the Irish and the Italian having tight knit
celebrations of being " white".  In Canada it is even more aparrent that
being part of the white majority also means you are english.  Being on the
west coast my contact with Quebecois culture had been minimal until I
started working at a French bakery to support myself through my BA.  A whole
new white culture opened up to me.  Yet it did not change my BC attitude
towards the Parti Quebecois.  I'm still fond of bumper stickers that exclaim
"Quebec seperates make them take Ontario!"

        Someone else was talking about how attitudes of color are
constructions of society and I think that is an excellent point. My
"whiteness" is the result of my upbringing and experience and my
perception of other races depends on how they are presented within my
realm.
        Ted's rather aburpt response to my previous post made judgements
on my life without any concept of how I live.  Although I value his incite
and his bold statments, I think his reactionary approach to my refusal to
apologized missed my intended meaning.  It all comes down to the futility
of formal apologies, it's not a matter of feeling threatened.

         Let's say you are left handed,and we the righteous majority of right
handers decide that all left handers are mutants and should have their
left hands cut off so you will no longer offend us.  We the majority then
force you to conform to our right handed ways.  Then forty years later we
see that we were wrong, science has proven that lefties aren't gimps.
Obviously we can't give back all those left hands, but we can do huge tv
campaigns and say "oops sorry, leftis are cool", "Hire a lefty", " lefties
do it better".  NOw does that make you feel any better, or wouldn't you,
the one handed, previously lefthanded person prefer that we, the right
hands actually did something useful with all that publicity money and
found a way to replace that hand or atleast compensate you for the emense
inconvience and humiliation you've suffered for the last forty years.

Dear Cris:

A few thoughts on your book exchange idea...

* It doesn't matter to me whether or not books exchanged are of equal
(retail or production) value. I would happily exchange 5-10 copies of a
perfectbound for an equal number of either chapbooks or "mimeos." This is
because:

* I probably wouldn't try to sell the books I'd exchanged for. It
wouldn't matter to me if -- let's take you as an example -- if you
exchanged 5 copies of your most recent for mine, and then tried to sell
mine. However you got them out would be fine w/me. What I would do with
yours would be to give them to friends who I think would appreciate them,
and/or include them as "bonus freebies" w/things of our own that we sent
out. (I could take them to readings, too, though we don't have a lot of
readings here in the Twin Cities.)

* As far as "nuts & bolts," that seems to be something each publisher
would have to work out with other publishers on a publisher-by-publisher
basis. Unless ...

* You mean maybe a "place" online that would be a list of publishers
(including their e- and/or snail-addresses) who have expressed interest
in participating in this exchange. (I like this idea, actually.)

How does the above strike you? Anyone?

Yours,

Gary

In a place where whiteness is next to ungodliness it's also an

        When I taught at a small college in Williamsburg, Virginia and
included three works by African-American writers in an American lit
class, students responded by suggesting I should have included more
Italian-American literature (for example); or by saying they'd been made
to feel guilty enough already.  But what was most disturbing was the way
in which they (not all, of course) considered it a course in American
literature, with some African-American stuff thrown in on the side.  I
was finally reduced to telling them that Toni Morrison's a better writer
than F. Scott Fitzgerald, which was to give in to a series of assumptions
that were better left alone.  A fine book on the canon is John Guillory's
_Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation_ (Johns
Hopkins), which leaves no one's canonical myth unturned.  Among his
points: there is no such thing as a canon; there are only syllabi.
There's also Michael Berube's book on the public debate over the canon,
where he rips William Bennett, et al, to shreds.

I'm with Gary on the exchange idea, including agreeing to exchange
perfectbound or smyth sewn books for chapbooks of various kinds. The only
worry is that, if I am only publishing two or three books per year (and
only getting back to that in 1995 after transition years after mid-1993
move) I may not be doing the quantity of work which many chapbook
publishers are doing. But these issues of quantity and value seem not the
point so much as getting the work around. In an edition of under 1000 I
would probably limit the quantity of books available for exchange, rather
than sale or author's copies or review copies, to 100 or less. I
particularly like the idea of exchanges with authors as well as
publishers, and I would not limit it to new books, either, although I
would like to exchange for books I don't already have and haven't already
read.

Susan, it is problematic to agree that Toni Morrison is a better writer
than F. Scott Fitzgerald, in several ways. Beyond the whiteness issue,
you have to define what "a better writer" means.

I was watching a late night locally produced arts television program last
year here in Minneapolis which featured Patrice Koelsch, in conversation
with artists and arts activists. Somehow the subject of Satchell Page's
autobiography, as literature, came up, and Patrice got rather angry that
such work was considered as literature, felt it was somehow an insult to
REAL writers like Toni Morrison and Alice Walker. I thought her position
was rather ludicrous, but realized I have might have been more in
agreement if the writers she cited were Amiri Baraka, Clarence Major, Bob
Kaufmann, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn Brooks, Nathaniel Mackey, Wanda
Coleman,or Langston Hughes. But then we're all back in the finding the
"better writer" game.

Several replies in random order:

The full citation is -- Allen, Theodore W. _The Invention of the White
Race: Racial Oppression and Social Control Vol.1_ (Vol. 2 nowhere in sight
yet). New York: Verso, 1994.

Yeah, I know all about Omi and Whynot -- good stuff there -- but a point
is getting missed (_and_ the "one drop" rule is a peculiar institution of
the U.S. -- things look quite different in the other colonies) -- Of
course race is a social construction -- what I find curious is the
shifting attitudes among self-declared white people about their whiteness
-- (this also parallels their shifting beliefs about just what
characterizes blackness, none of which has much to do with skin color at
all).

That is, to link back to Chris's observations, most celebrations of white
ethnic traditions such as St. Patrick's parades and so forth are quite
apart from any celebration of whiteness (except when the neoAryan types
reppropriate them, as has happened with some Celtic and Scottish
celebrations in the NorthWest in recent years) -- and, interestingly
enough, many of these are among communities, like the Irish and the
Italians, who earlier in the century were not considered white people in
most of the U.S. --  It is sometimes an easy matter to shift such a
celebration immediately and forcefully into a "white" thing -- this often
happened in the bad old days when a black person wandered into the
proceedings --

My curiosity has been about the lack of content of the concept of
whiteness for most young people who think of themselves as white, coupled
with their, to me, odd attitudes about that very identification -- that
is, to repeat myself from last time, the students with whom I have this
conversation insist that they do not see the world racially at all, and
yet when they describe what they take to be the "norms" of US existence,
it is very clearly a description in which all non-whites are viewed as
deviating from what is posited as a norm --

I'll try to say this more coherently another time -- bottom line, most of
my white students would insist vehemently that they have _never_
benefitted in any way from being white -- indeed, they tend to believe
that "reverse discrimination" is _the_ social problem of our era (though
the overwhlemingly white senior faculty at even this school would seem to
indicate this isn't much of a factor in real academic employment) -- They
often react as if even to discuss the history of slavery is to accuse
them, as individuals, of something, and that to discuss history is to be
anti-white --  since most of them have little or no knowledge of that
history, I doubt that this is the result of their having been brow-beaten
with it in K-12 school.

On the other hand, there are some really exciting young students showing
up who actually read books and care about the textual past -- some of
them are rereading the works of the 19th century abolitionists (_and_ the
proslavery books) and producing analyses that are breathtaking in their
originality and usefulness --

Anybody out there read Thomas Wentworth Higginson's memoirs lately? He
was entirely wrong about both Dickinson and Whitman (quite a record
there!) but his autobiographical works are tremendous; almost on a par
with Melville.

Was Edward Taylor a white poet?  Longfellow?  W.S. Barithwaite?

Lindz: I think you are right up  to a point, but you don't go far enough.
     All the interesting analyses of "whiteness" so far, except for Aldon's
fail to follow the chain of signfication adequately. Yes, whiteness signifies
lack but lack of what: ethnicity. Ethnicity, I would argue, is the second term
of the opposition European/ethnic, of simply white/ethnic. Ethnic, whether
Jew, Italian, Ethopian, etc, signifies difference from a normative whiteness,
thus it is possible even to place white trash as the supplement if the
normative whiteness is, for instance, white yuppie. White also (take a
look at Goethe's optics) signifies purity, cleanliness, while ethnic
signifies impurity, curruption, which is why this construction is so
hard to displace because the supplement, with all of its political implications
is a constuction of language and culture.
     Lindz, you also seem to view genocide ahistorically, that is, to see
the genocide of Native Americans totally distinct from the genocide of Jews
that culminated in Auschwitz. Genocide is a historical process, perhaps the
apotheosis of our historical situation.
     Which is why we cannot forget, or simply say, well, whoopdedoo, that all
happened a long time ago and has no relation to me at all. The fact is that
language and history has not changed, and the conditions are ripe for another
genocide and another and another, and if we keep saying that none of us are
implicated because we had nothing to do with it, it will never stop.
     Lindz, you are absolutely correct when you say apologizing isn't enough,
but forgetting just allows it to keep happening. Thanks, Eric.

Ed: As usual I appreciate your wit and insight.
     But I think that even saying art is not political is a profoundly
political stament that has a specific politica history, going back in
the English tradition to attempts to inculcate East Indian subjects
into Western values. Indians were very resistant to Biblical studies,
but English educators decided that in order to keep Indians "good
subjects of English rule," they had to give them Christian values.
They noticed that good Christians rarely attempt revolution in the
temporal world (although there are some attempts now to do so).
     The English decided that Western literature was so steeped in
Christian values (not sure that this is correct either) that you could
teach that and make them Christian without making them Christians.
In order to do that they had to claim that lit. was not at all political,
and was in fact higher than that, beyond that, above that, or else
another form of resistence, they thought, was likely to develop.
     This little story is surely flattened out, the processes made
simpler than they were, but I think it demonstrates the political
ease with which the claim to non-politics can be political.
     Having said all this, I now admit that I do in some sense agree with
an earlier post that said that a poem, or other work of art can have
a political content as well as a content of "spirit." For me, though, even
spirit would be a political term as it would capture the ineffable sense
of a society in which nobody would starve, which seems as close to
transcendence as we are likely to get.
     Thanks, Eric.

Subject:      re-politics again

The relation between something called poetry and something called
politics is deeply obscure.
To say that poetry is always political
collapses one into the other.

Poetry (and Art) likewise, and just as plausibly or impluasibly,
is always philosophy, always
religion, always sociolgy.  In other words there is
no poetry, no
poetics, no "poetics"list as an in any way identifiable issue or set
of issues.
All its issues can be covered by political discourses,
religious discourses, theoretical discourses, sociological and
anthropological discourses?
Poetology becomnes a sub-branch of some
other  - ology too glibly.

(What was that you were saying a
month or so ago Spencer Selby apropos theory
 when I tried to
intervene in the debate over theory?)

Denying that poetry is political is necessary in the face
of the threat to submit poetry to the terms and judgments of
political doctrine or religious doctrine or the proposals of
some moral code.

Insisting  that poetry is political, religious and moral is
just as necessary when poetry  claims complete
autonomy from social process

The argument goes on, as if it can ever be resolved
on one side or the other.  Well, can it?    Isn't it
required for poetics to exist as something to write and talk
about that it be something other than politics etc, while
yet always adjacent to politics etc.

I hate to spoil a fun argument, but it's one of those arguments that
can only end up with a recognition of a measure of  one and a measure
of the other.

When Spencer Selby wants to deny theory, I defend theory as
being a condition of any poem whatsoever.  When Ron and Tom
want to insist on politics I want to side with Ed Foster and defend
poetry's distinctiveness (and autonomy).

Eric to Lindz:

Lindz, you are absolutely correct when you say apologizing isn't enough,
but forgetting just allows it to keep happening. Thanks, Eric.

I haven't been following the last few days closely. And I would say to
Lindz, hang in there. And I would say to Eric, not apologizing, does not
mean forgetting. What it means for me is letting go of something that
cannot help me move forward. Things must change. They inevitably do
change. The question is how they will change. I think if one can try to
open and grow personally, it goes a long way, or perhaps it's the idea
that the longest journey is begun with the first step or whatever that
line is.

The thing that annoys me about politics and sides, is that it's so facile.
People not to mention circumstances are complex. It is good to look at as
many sides or perspectives as possible. When one speaks of governments
(not revolutions) one speaks of change at a snail's pace if one speaks of
change at all, in any real sense of the word. I think Foucault said something
in an essay on power, to the effect that what we need today is to break
away from the institutions that continue to mold us in ways we no longer
wish to be molded.

I am not so politically minded. I may stand here on one issue and there
on another. I don't buy into one agenda. For me it's a personal trip.

I have seen the problems that arose with definitions of post modern and
deconstruction. I sometimes wonder if it has to do with their use in
several disciplines or is it that we are still too close to it.

I am wondering if someone can give me a definition or several of language
poetry.

Hallo all,

I just wanted to respond, in one post, to lots of different lines that
have developed since I logged on six days ago. This, no doubt, means that
if anyone is like me they will not read the comments not attached to the
strain they're following, or, read comments if they like the person, often
because that person has made a real connection (leading to a backchannel)
among all the hubbub of the list proper. I feel like I'm made some great
personal connections, but as a sort of parasite on the list, yet many seem
to feel like that too. POETICS is the city of us sub-urbs.

Anyway,

I really liked Aldon's detailed remarks, and all of the alerting to racism
issues, but I think some of what Lindz is saying about the *interpersonal*
dynamics is interesting; this expression "kissing ass" is interesting. One
can be very engaged with the struggle to end racism, and still be manoeuvred
into playing the feed for an acting-out against those who look like oneself
(white, male, bisexual, in my case) who have acted in a bigoted way towards
one's interlocutor in the past. Sorry, that's badly put. I mean, I can, in
an interpersonal connection with somebody who has been attacked by other
white male bisexuals in the past say "yes, that's really bigoted of them,
I won't treat you like that, I hate that behaviour", and what happens next,
and over some weeks in some of my experiences, is that the person (attacked
woman, attacked gay person who's been mistreated by a bisexual, attacked
mixed race person etc) takes out his/her revenge on me as if I were the
the other white male bisexual who attacked them. I know that the use of
psychology has often been to excuse racism eg Susan Schultz's point about
Ebert reading Once There Were Warriors as about alcoholism not pakeha racism
against maori. But there can be such a thing as a good psychology by someone
not racist. By which I mean, I have myself often stored up very angry feelings
of vengefulness against someone who mistreated me and shut their ears to
hearing my anger at their mistreatment of me; I dream what I'd say to them,
I see them in the street and imagine having a showdown there and then. If I
do this, I suspect others do too. And I see the situations I'm describing as
the attacked person saying "ah ha, a stage to deliver the lines I've been
writing in my head". This is human, and I'm not painting myself as a victim
of it; I often do now withstand this stored-up outburst and then quietly
comment that I agree, and I'm not like that myself. But I wonder if this
is in any way adjacent to what Lindz was saying...

I also wanted to welcome Herb, as another fan of New Music, and an enthusiast
for the human voice. I share Herb's frustration at the rhetorical use of
the term "voice" in poetic criticism. Voice-work, in music and sound
compositions, is very exciting, and poets who *are* proud of having a
"voice" often display none of the abilities to introduce warmth, space etc
into syllables and phonemes that singers have (indeed, what i *love* about
a lot of language poetry is precisely that it *does* use this kind of
singer's attention to syllables and phonemes). The singing voice doesn't
have to be singular anymore than the poetic voice; I think of the way that
someone like Bob Dylan loves the way his voice changes, and uses the new
feel of it as *material*, just as some poets use new font or new life
circumstances as *material*. What I like about Herb's emphasis is it stops
us attacking the voice per se, and reminds us that it is over-simplification,
trying too hard for consistency, that is at fault *in all arts*.

I'd better also, though it's a dead strain by now, respond a little to Miles's
response to my report on the now infamous London reading. He's right that
I read, though as part of an open floor not as an invited reader, for five
minutes at the very end of the reading, and he's right that I'm male too,
actually I do include myself in the sweeping attacks on over-representation
of males, but then I counter that a little by the odd fact of not really
being fully represented, since I am never invited, or put on the bill, as
Miles often is. I certainly don't condemn anyone for living in London, as
I think Miles knows that two of my very favourite poets, Denise Riley
and Caroline Bergvall, live in London. I think the point I made in both my
reports from England and New Zealand is that the scene is so stupidly small
that no-one can take honest criticism but has to think of the critic as
someone anti-male or anti-London and so the criticisms are discountable.

it seems that if someone has been wronged, and feels a formal apology has
symbolic significance tht would restore his/her dignity and mark an
acknowledgment on the part of the wrongdoer, it is not the wrongdoer's task to
point out the practical futility of apologies and "refuse to apologize" on the
grounds that it is not in the interest of the wronged.  that phenomenon, of the
power-majority deciding what is in the best interest of the subordinated,
perpetuates an unjust hierarchy where those in power don't think they have to
listen.--maria damon

LindZ,

Yes, it was abrupt of me, and for that I "apologize."  But you said you
valued my "incite" -- a clever pun if that's what you meant.  Nonetheless,
the first time we talk and I begin by shouting.  It's just I have heard the
argument "what are we supposed to do, keep kissing ass?" argument more times
than I care to, which where I live usually means, "Can we go back to the way
we used to do things," and usually doesn't even ask but simply glorifies a
past which never existed, in terms of, e.g., Norman Rockwell, Ronald Reagan,
whoever else you care to include.

Lindz: I think Ted is right on this point. I don't know where he is speaking
from, but in Louisiana, incidentally an extremely interesting and complex place
or I wouldn't be here, any discussion at all about "oppression," "genocide,"
the rights of women, are likely to draw the most antagonistic stares. One
of my students is the daughter of a state senator (Woody Jenkins who also
owns the only local TV station). THis senator recently said "at one time,
only people who owned property voted. We're a long way from that,
unfortunately." I just happened to catch this, and what amazes me is that
there has been no protest, no outcry, except from me and I am a, quote,
California yankee."
     I should say that Louisiana folks are the most friendly I've ever
encountered, but keep the doors locked at night.
     If I sound defensive on these posts, it's because I am. Forgive me
if I sound too doctrinairre, but I do it mostly to remind myself that
there are other points of view than the LA. Also, I urge you to remember
that we haven't even come to close to winning the elephant wars, and
they've got all the ammunition so far.
     Thanks, Eric.

        Hi Chris--

        I would be very curious to hear about what poets you first read,
and everyone else, what got you into this.  Partly I ask as a teacher who
is always looking for the best poetential seduction material.

        For me it happened like this: I got excited by the existential
challenge of "My Shadow," by Robert Louis Stevenson, which I had to
memorize when I was six. (Isolation, overactive mind, imaginary friends
etc etc.)  Then I only wrote the stuff until sixth grade,
when I began to rummage in the desk I used during my (very boring) class
on the history of the Americas.  I don't know whose desk it was, but they
were male and older, and he was harboring a copy of Ferlinghetti's *Coney
Island of the Mind.*  Maybe-- and this is interesting to me-- maybe I
responded out of curiosity about the Italian name.  The book was color,
color, color all the way home, in a surrealistic sense.

        You?

There is a quality in the discussion of "whiteness" and the arguments
that surface and re-surface which bothers me.  Or perhaps i enjoy
it in an odd way.  The quality is Faulknerian.  I think Ted said/
wrote to Lindz that "It's just i have heard the argument "what are
we supposed to do, keep kissing ass?" argument more times than I care
to".  True enough.  It is a kind of re-telling of the same point (of
view) overnover in hopes that it will open and blossom into something
new and meaningful: in hopes that there is a point of arrival.
But the result, in my mind and senses, is suffocating.  Instead
of arriving at some kind of closure in the discussion, we have
generated an enclosure in which nothing extra-ordinarily new
can be cultivated.  Yes, i think it quite Faulknerian.  Anyone?

Dear Lindz & Eric:

I sent you a message early this morning around 3am when I couldn't sleep,
so decided to read my mail. I can't locate that info  about Foucault and
the power essay. I read it long ago and don't seem to have a copy. I may
not have said it quite right. I believe it is not just about breaking
away from the institution but also about changing the institution itself.
That another topic I won't get into now. A friend has arrived
for dinner.

Ed, yes/no & yes/no, on both "sides" of the issue.  The issue's
topology is possibly *not* one with a polarity and opposite sides to
it.  Shifting phases, eruptions of geysers, gaseous dispersal, --
instances of alternative models.  It's to do with power of
adjudication, censure, censorial process (god is a good word for it).
   And
can poems be subjected to political analysis without remainder?

   And
can that political analysis be subjected to a further political analysis
   without remainder?
          And whose analysis in either case?

Maybe the ground needs to shift to rhetoric, to the advantages of
discourses which are inclusive of fable, scenarios, personae and
image as against those that seek to exclude them.
        Figuring it that way  Politics  is a name for a species of
discourse and  the results of poetry are apt to be indeterminate as
to their effects.  Also beyond the intentional control  of the
writer(s) or speaker(s).  A lot of it is down to luck, not prior
theorizing of any kind.
       What political discourse can do is isolate the factors of
publication and artist/audience relations and fasten on aspects of
content (mainly) and, with Langpo, maybe on  formal structures too (from the
point of view of reception theory and reading and writing practice --defiance of syntactic norms, of
narrative forms for instance).
       What else can it do?
        What it can promote at its worst is PC (discipline-guilt
dominance-submission relations between theorist and poet).
           The poet's role may not be easily contained.  Transgression
        has long been a part of it.  That may be interpreted
politically.  But if dogma, conventions, disciplines and rules,
judgments by academies,  or similar gods,  get in
the way of composiiton and performance, watch out for poetry.

     Am I reading the continuing argument correctly?

By the way an attempt
to censor the net by NZ
politicians is following
the U.S. pattern.  Becos
there's porn getting to minors,
institutions shd be held
responsible for employees
behaviour, and all net users
shd be subjected to control.

   Well, Marisa, the beats were biggies...but the poets who came to my
   undergraduate school were Gerald Stern (who I later read with, ugh!)
   and Daniel Hoffman--he read from his Southian epic, BROTHERLY LOVE.
   PBS was taping it and I think the camera panned the audience and caught
   me nodding off...John Yau came (this was 1985) and turned me onto the
   New York School (O'Hara, Koch, Ashbery) and this lead me to Tzara....
   One night (wasted) i was reading Tzara to a friend of mine who just came
   back from England and he pulled out his big Bertolt Brecht collected
   and said you know what Bertolt would say about this, and then made a
   reproachful noisy gesture...and so i experienced my first "poetry
   battle"--but, hey, I like them both...and until this semester when
   I worked with Pierre Joris neither of these writers were taught in
   English departments (--no doubt coz they're "not in the american
   grain")...and perhaps it was the fact that they weren't corrupted by
   academia that I was able to enjoy them more than even the "alternative"
   writers who were taught when i got my M.A. at Temple back when Jesse
   Jackson was a brief frontrunner in the democratic primaries.... Well,
   that's one version of my "THROTTLING" Any others? Chris

Dear Tony,

Thanks for sensible thoughts. I would remind you that I never denied
theory per se. What I denied were claims that are made for theory and
uses to which it is often put.

Before that, I became Mr. AntiTheory simply because I maintained that art
has its own level. This was my way of saying that art/poetry exceeds all
the discourse surrounding it (a claim that seems obvious to me, but which
others were drawing ominous conclusions from).

You and I had an exchange in which you seemingly equated theory with
poetics. I responded that I'm interested in the space where theory and
poetics don't overlap.

Another thing I remember: Cris Cheek said every poem's a theory and I
answered that that's the kind of theory I like best.

My Best To You,
Spencer

Subject:      The poetics of whiteness

Latching on to and decontextualizing Tony Green's words, I want to
suggest that saying "all poetry is political" does not necessarily
collapse the two, not unless one's sense of poetry is
quite limited.  (Not that I imagine Tony's is, but) poetry lives,
all poetry I'd argue, in a variety of neighborhoods simultaneously.

To say all poetry is political is not the same as saying: all poetry
is ONLY political. But then the temptation to modify political with
"only" may suggest a particular attitude toward politics.

It's just such a limiting or constraining definition/delimitation
of politics that seems implicit in the 'ass-kissing' interpretation
of revisionist (in the good sense) U.S. history.

To respond as if such political claims were only about "you" or "me"
(just as TG flinches gainst one collapse) is to collapse the political
into the personal--this is not the aim of the familiar slogan.

The scale of the issues most recently put to words by Pelton, Nielsen,
Schultz and others makes such a reduction--who me?, my politics?,
my grandparents?--absurd.  Personal guilt is hardly sufficient or
even meaningful retribution for genocide.

I wonder if Ed and Lindz would be more or less revolted if I said
poetry is political because personhood too is political.  This
is written several hours after watching Nightline coverage of the
OK disaster which began with a sequence of brief testimonials by
Americans across the country expressing their outrage, that this
could happen in a 'free society' (in three of 10 or so clips),
assuming an us/them, we're-at-war attitude within hours, before
it's even remotely clear what the cause of the blast is.
Meanwhile Ted K. displays pictures of Beirut bombings and prods
guests to assert that the 'truck bomb' M.O. makes it likely
these are Islamic terrorists too!

Being at the Calumet Arts Cafe, listening to Steve Lacy and
Irene Aebi perform Creeley and Spicer poems instead of watching this
quote news unquote quote develop unquote becomes, in retrospect,
political too.

And, in response to Nielsen's earlier question about the constitution
of whiteness:

One can argue that Poetry is not Political; ONE name for the priviledge
to do so is 'whiteness'.

no, ken, i wouldn't be revolted. that business "the personal is political" is much ingrained (sp?) these days, and you can't escape the personal, i think, if only because the words are always yours. but that's the flaw, the reason every poem fails.

Thinking slowly over Ken Sherwood and Spencer Selby's "re-politics
again posts"  Poetry Always or Poetry Only Political?   The space
between poetry and theory.

"Chthonic". Howling. Oklahoma horror,
grief and pity.  Poetry  as something that stems from beyond
words to speak.  Ecstatic. That was at root of  my sense of any/all art 1950's
teenage mutant years.  Unlikely locations for this in writing in my
reading in Faber & Faber Eliot/Pound/Stevens/Louis MacNeice
--"Autumn Journal"+ Hopkins(Penguin) + Dylan Thomas collected, but not usually found. Lorca.  Reading for
over a year through A la Recherche... writing clumsily little love
lyrics (Geez! how embarrassing) and participating in genteel poetry
society at school  NETWORK ANNOUNCEMENT TEAM NZ AHEAD
OF I AUS BY l2 SECS AT FIRST MARK with vocal noise poetry piece,
phonemic but not words, sudden erupting"avant-gardism".  With so much
engagement with process and question of where "authentic" poetry comes from (like music)and elimination
of "statement" + "content" I wd have been a sucker for Tzara? but
that was way outside what I could find then. Otherwise and later at
Cambridge, I got to read (other people's poems mainly) aloud at the
gatherings in Senior Tutor's rooms, Tom Henn, Yeats scholar
extraordinaire.  This nostalgia stuff ends here -- Dept staff
meeting in 2 mins. Questions of Workloads.

         Where I'm coming from there is political and other
discourses are simply irrelevant at most levels of composing.  Is
that the space between Spencer.  Seen from a distance by a Subject, I
guess the poet/poetry as Object can be subjected to any and every
-ology.  No doubt it's proper to think of such things.

        Tony, I'd like you to unpack the logic of this assertion. In what
        sense(s) is this an obscure relation? Do you mean that the relationship
        of Dante's poetry to the politics of his life or era is "obscure?" (I
        assume not). Do you mean the politics of Pasolini's poetry, or for that
        matter of Montale's, is obscure? Again, I assume not. Do you simply
        mean these relations are difficult or complicated? Sure, but this is
        evidence for their importance, their inward deepness, not against. Or
        do you mean the relations between two abstractions "poetry" and
        "politics" are what is obscure? Watch out, that smacks of theory!

Poetry may analyze as it may praise or criticize embrace or
shun. The claim that poetry is political is an altogether
different claim that all human life is political, a conviction
that individual life, individual consciousness, individual
action, occur subsequent to a political placement out of which
that individual that individuality grows. This is minimally
the claim; it is a simple one and to my way of thinking (I
mean my way of experiencing the world and the sum of those
experiences as well) it is true.

Authors, language, rhyme in no/every sense, these do not
exist in an eternity of unplaced place. Ideas are not in
dialogue but all humans are, those dead as those alive.
The life of the word, what we call poetry, is this emergent
fact or facet. To call it political is no more than to point
out that history cannot be reduced to a set of adjectives or
qualities, but is people speaking back consciously and
unconsciously out of their conditions and in response
to judgment. Poetry is out of that place, the minim
of the soul - when we can reach it - is from there too.
Paradise too, like poetry, is political.

It was weird the newsflash came up.  I half read it, assumed that NZ
was winning.  But of course I had to get it off screen to go on
writing.  And simply read what I "wanted" to happen..

Oh but yes, selva oscura as it gets -- concerned with  the moral
behaviour of contemporaries, can be read as if it were journalism.  I
guess you mean it can be done with the *poetry * of Dante.  Does that
though finish with it, does its effort and effect end there, or does
that leave a large remainder of unread aspect.

#Do you simply#       (no I'm writing out of confused complexity)   # mean these

verse or song.     And I agree, good thing that complexity.

# do you mean the relations between two abstractions "poetry" and

Yes, it is terminology
that I'm bothered by.  Not so much "abstractions" as very slippery
words.
                   Politics seems in the context of writing to cover sometimes
(often? usually?) the topic about which writing states positions and makes
arguments.   There's a bbbut there, isn't there?   Is that all that
the poem does?    It can also be extended to consideration of the stance
implied by address to audience, publication.    But isn't there
"something "in the movement of the hearer trough the perfomrance of the
poem (especially heard, but also read as if said or sung) that is
working?

" Poetry" in the context of political views and opinions tends to be
treated as instrumental.

#Watch out, that smacks of theory!#

Yes, of course, "smacks of", but what *theory* is that then?


"To say that poetry is always political collapses one into the
other."   I said.  Ken says  "only political" would be more
appropriate there.


       # To say that live beings are always breathing is reductive?#

Analogy has its moments.   This may be one of them, but I don't think
so.

Montale, I've read a little of and I guess you're right there.

I'm not frightened by politics and by theory.  But those, as
discourses, or topics, sometimes claim the right to the last word
in critical judgment and prescription. That, as I see it, is out of
order.  (And isn't that what is complained of in the New Criticism?)

Subject:      throttled by angels

When i was learning to read (aged 5-7) my dad would regularly read me 'The
Jabberwocky' or 'The Courtship of the Yongy-Bongy Bo' at bedtime. Left an
indelible impression re - playfulness and word invention, edge between
seeming nonsense and almost understanding being delightfully teased or
exquisitely interfered with.

School gave flashes in amongst the Chaucer / Shakespeare of something more
'parallel'. But, at that time, the short poems by Wordsworth or Keats or
Donne I was accessed to seemed too neat to interface with the complexities
of life as I was growing into it. I went to the same school as
Manley-Hopkins and liked his sound (particularly in something like 'Harry
Ploughman') but suspected his beliefs.

Primary influence was Jimi Hendrix (my socks spontaneously combusted!)  -
seeing him in concert a couple of times when i was 12 years old (including
the guitar burning at the Albert Hall). The inter-related line between
improvisation and composition  -  melody, rhythm and noise in dynamic
tension  -  sensuality of engagement with textures of consciousness  -
railing against closure  -  inclusion of failure  -  embracing energies.
Got me into poetry. Left school determined to learn something.

Hung out as a seventeen year old in bookshops and hit the Rimbaud / de
Nerval / Lautremont / Baudelaire / Jarry / Arp / Tzara trail pretty hard.
Also Shelley / Thomas Love Peacock and Blake.

At nineteen i 'lucked out' in meeting Eric Mottram, Allen Fisher, Bob
Cobbing, Bill Griffiths and many others. But between the four of them they
introduced me to poets from all of the Americas, art movements such as
Fluxus, Lettrism, DIAS and Mail Art, Sound Poetry and Text-Sound
Composition and Early English poetry (in particular Icelandic, Norse and
Anglo-Saxon fragments).

A few things to be going on with.

Over the past three weeks I've been reading Lorca and Brecht and yes Spicer
and listening to Tricky.

All poetry is political?

Well, all politics is spiritual. All religion is aesthetic.

Are these propositions anything more than an exercise in forcing one
human activity to signify in the terms of another? A violent translation
of one order of meaning into another? An assertion of the bottomless
interconnectednesss of every gesture we make?

Name the one that's true and you name your dream of foundation and kneel
before your priests (who Blake called Druids because of their sacrifice
of the human).

mike and others:  if "all poetry is political" strikes you as a truism,
perhaps that's because you're operating out of (or in) a context (by which
i mean to say a historically situated place) in which such a statement is
viewed as such... where i've spent most of my time (in industry, and in
academe) MOST of the folks i've run into OBJECT to this assertion... despite
all of the brouhaha associated with pc and cultural studies and and and,
fact is a clear majority of academics (which includes in my anecdotal
recollection at least three generations of same) as well as a clear majority
of factory workers (blue, white and baby blue collar) would not quite
understand at first glance the connection twixt the poetic and the political...

all by way of saying, without going on too too long, that there's surely
a context *against which* "all poetry is political" resonates as something
other than a truism... so i take you to be saying that that context is
not particularly interesting, pertinent, what have you... but then i'd want
you to clarify how it is you perceive that context... quickly, from my pov,
the assertion gains currency as a connoisseurship notion of art loses
currency...

what do you say?...

Let's say that something escapes, something transcends, soemthing goes
beyond. Let's just say that.

What would it go beyond, what would be escaped? Onlyexchange.

Isn't it entirely political to say, in the context of all out
monopoly capitalism, that something escapes colonialization,
even if all we are saying is that some small part of some
art is all that goes beyond?

To say that, I think, would not be to "collapse art into the
political" at all but would in fact make a very bold claim
for art.

Thanks, Eric.

careful, tom, using the word "political" as you do makes it mushy, i think, rather like yet another oversoul or collective unconscious, a good ground for theoretical elaborations, it may be, but in poetry, enough?

I received the following from a Czech mathematician friend of mine.

     I should forward you a letter from three Russian mathematicians
- I'd be wondering whether anyone in the States cares about what's
going on in Russia. just explain you what's so important on this
letter - those three guys are definitely one of the best Russian
mathematicians of younger generation (between 30-40). One of them
- Drinfeld is a Fields medailist and he was first who introduced
quantum groups and recognized their importance in math. physics.

     He's spent his whole life in Kharkov where he's still working,
in contrast to many Russian mathematician (usually of the world
top level) who immediately after 1990 escaped Russia and took
prof positions  at prestigious universities over the world.

LETTER

Dear friends,

     We are compelled to write to you from the feeling that terrible
crimes committed by Russian authorities and armed forces in Chechnya
are not accidental, and that we are all responsible for them.
These crimes, according to the testimony of the journalists,
defenders of human rights, and mothers of the soldiers fighting
there, include not only bombing towns and villages inhabited by
civilians but also the capturing of hostages, robberies, organization
of filtration camps where people, incarcerated on the basis of
their race, are cruelly beaten, tortured, maimed and murdered.

     All these actions should be characterized as GENOCIDE and
Crime against Humanity.  And they can not be considered merely as
an internal affair of Russia.

     Chechen crisis is not accidental.  It reveals the criminal
essence of the political regime that is being formed in Russia.
The most dangerous aspect of the present situation is the absence
of a clear appreciation of this fact.

     Instead in the public opinion, especially in the West, there
still exists the myth that Russia is moving towards democracy and
reforms and, unless Yeltsin is supported, fascists of the type of
Zhirinovsky will take over.

      We consider this opinion as deeply erroneous.  Supporting
democracy and human rights by words, the regime is persecuting
them in the cynical and brutal way.  Many facts give evidence for
this, such as beatings and killings of the honest journalists and
human rights defenders who get and publish information dangerous
for the regime, criminal and corrupted methods of the privatization,
and many other things.  Now there is an attempt of annihilation
of a whole nation.

     Acting by fascist methods the regime uses Zhirinovsky and
the threat of fascism for manipulating public opinion.

     Russia is not moving by the path of democracy and human
rights.  A new regime, unusual in its cruelty and falsehood, is
being born.

     Whether the criminal regime or democracy with human face
will take over in Russia, will in the first place depend on people
in Russia, our ability to understand the danger and take
responsibility, our courage and will to stand against evil.

      However the realization by people in the West of the true
state of affairs in Russia and the support of democracy, not
Yeltsin, are also crucial.

      We ask your help in spreading  our letter.

LETTER

Dear friends,

     We are compelled to write to you from the feeling that terrible
crimes committed by Russian authorities and armed forces in Chechnya
are not accidental, and that we are all responsible for them.
These crimes, according to the testimony of the journalists,
defenders of human rights, and mothers of the soldiers fighting
there, include not only bombing towns and villages inhabited by
civilians but also the capturing of hostages, robberies, organization
of filtration camps where people, incarcerated on the basis of
their race, are cruelly beaten, tortured, maimed and murdered.

     All these actions should be characterized as GENOCIDE and
Crime against Humanity.  And they can not be considered merely as
an internal affair of Russia.

     Chechen crisis is not accidental.  It reveals the criminal
essence of the political regime that is being formed in Russia.
The most dangerous aspect of the present situation is the absence
of a clear appreciation of this fact.

     Instead in the public opinion, especially in the West, there
still exists the myth that Russia is moving towards democracy and
reforms and, unless Yeltsin is supported, fascists of the type of
Zhirinovsky will take over.

      We consider this opinion as deeply erroneous.  Supporting
democracy and human rights by words, the regime is persecuting
them in the cynical and brutal way.  Many facts give evidence for
this, such as beatings and killings of the honest journalists and
human rights defenders who get and publish information dangerous
for the regime, criminal and corrupted methods of the privatization,
and many other things.  Now there is an attempt of annihilation
of a whole nation.

     Acting by fascist methods the regime uses Zhirinovsky and
the threat of fascism for manipulating public opinion.

     Russia is not moving by the path of democracy and human
rights.  A new regime, unusual in its cruelty and falsehood, is
being born.

     Whether the criminal regime or democracy with human face
will take over in Russia, will in the first place depend on people
in Russia, our ability to understand the danger and take
responsibility, our courage and will to stand against evil.

      However the realization by people in the West of the true
state of affairs in Russia and the support of democracy, not
Yeltsin, are also crucial.

      We ask your help in spreading  our letter.

My ego can't resist telling the world (at least this small world) about my
early influences.  Growing up a working class in Indiana it was difficult
to find out about anything.  An art teacher at my high school lent me her
copy of Moholy Nagy's Vision in Motion, an old textbook for the Institute
of Design.  The last hundred pages were about "contemporary" literature,
where I learned of Joyce, Stein, the writings of the insane and children,
and surrealism.  I studied this book for a couple of years, as if it were a
bible, trying to ingest a conceptual framework to hang this stuff on.  The
illustration on the cover of Women's Issue of Mirage comes from this book.

Then there was Baudelaire and more Baudelaire and more Baudelaire.

I was always reading A Controversy of Poets without much understanding.

Genet was god and Violette LeDuc was the goddess.

And Sylvia Plath continues to this day to be an unending source of
inspiration. I bow down to Jacqueline Rose for FINALLY writing about Plath
with the intelligence and respect she deserves.

This seems either an extreme exaggeration or a misunderstanding of what
I, Ed, Tony and others have maintained.

Poetry exists within all these contexts, political and otherwise. But it
also exceeds all these contexts, in so far as it is alive and has its own
artistic kind of totality. This life isn't nowhere or totally autonomous
or in eternity, but it is autonomous to the degree that it cannot be
entirely pinned down or explained. Often, if the work is very good, there
will be more disagreement than agreement regarding its positions,
meaning, significance. We can and should be concerned with the
work's positions, we can and should grapple with and even argue about the
work's value and meaning, if it comes to that. But we should do this
always keeping in mind that the work exceeds all of this thought and
discourse. To me, this is not elevating the work to some eternal beyond,
it is just showing respect for life--the same kind of respect I would
give to any living organism or entity.

Ed Foster writes:

        "careful, tom, using the word "political" as you do makes it mushy, i

        enough?"

in response, I guess, to my:

        "Authors, language, rhyme in no/every sense, these do not
        exist in an eternity of unplaced place. Ideas are not in
        dialogue but all humans are, those dead as those alive.
        The life of the word, what we call poetry, is this emergent
        fact or facet."

"I guess" in the sense that I can't find anything else in my words that
reasonably could suggest "politics" in relation to (much less "rather like")
"yet another oversoul."

But, my words really read the opposite, don't they, Ed? People in dialogue.
The part the dead play in this dialogue is me echoing Bakhtin's beautiful
words:

        "There is no first or last discourse, and dialogical context
        knows no limits...At every moment of the dialogue, there are
        immense and unlimited masses of forgotten meanings, but, in
        some subsequent moments, as the dialogue moves forward they
        will return to memory and live in renewed form...Nothing is
        absolutely dead: every meaning will celebrate its rebirth."

(I've just cut/pasted that from some notes of mine on B; can't supply
the reference immediately, but wd find it for anyone interested.)

In other words, I don't think I'm occulting the poetic object by
calling it political, merely pointing out the act of witness and
the transmission thereof, which is something that comes back and
is capable of new meaning. The specificity and multiplicity of each
poetic act arise out of the political condition of that witness.
No doubt I'm simply convinced, and my puzzlement that anyone should
not just and plainly see that as the difference between one language
and another is a political fact, so is the difference between one
word and another - and so is the rhyme between one word and another...
this puzzlement I say must just be me thinking a thing straightforward
which to another doesn't exist...

It's funny, Ron Silliman and I first encountered each other nearly
twenty years ago on a panel at Intersection (in SF) called "Politics
& Poetry" where I said more or less what I'm saying now. (I say "encountered"
because we'd certainly met a few times before, but never entered
any kind of dialogue).

My argument that night long ago turned on a passage quoted from
Mao's little red book, beginning "Where do correct ideas come
from?"

I don't think they fall from the sky. No oversouls.

"Are there then any incorrect ideas?"

I find it funny such a question is asked (however rhetorically) in the wake
of the Oklahoma City bombing, where it now seems apparent that the car
bomb was placed by a rightist militia group, or someone associated with a
rightist militia group (already, on NET an ultraconservative sydicated
network popular here they are bemoaning the "lefty media" that is
"persecuting" these militia groups).

Ed, the elephants, big dumb creatures that they are, have turned to wolves
(no harm to actual animals was intended by his post). And the thing is,
they've already started feeding.

I'm interested in the concept of language poetry, writing into and away
from language.  Poetic manipulation of form and connotation is an art form
that I quite admire.  I also wonder if we are somewhat too close to
define post modernism, although I consider myself too young to ever be a
post modernist.  I was recently writing on Atwood and Marian Engel and both
 of them admitted they never consciously wrote in a post modern frame of
mind, yet their wrote is typically suited to this genre.


                Any thoughts?

It's interesting this should come up right now.  I was talking
with Georges (STanley and Bowering) the other night and Stanley
raised that wonderful Spicer quote "language is the furniture in
the room".  But he placed an emphasis on it I hadn't heard before:
"language is _only_ the furniture in the room".  I love the
analogy but I don't know if I agree with "only".  I tend to
feel that Blaser is right: language is never a tool that one
employs or a device or anything like that.  It is older than
you, it is bigger than you and if anything it employs you.

The other issue which was hot in our talk was the potential
of language poetry.  What more can it do?  Its role in the
feminist discourse is essential, I think.  But when history
is interrogated syntactically and the fragments are thrown
to the wind, what or can anything be erected in its place?
)no phallic pun intended(  Than again, everything's still
kinda fuzzy so we may have been talking about something else.

every once in a regretable while something like an Aristotelean moment
descends.  Therefore
I want to say something like
everything that is directed even individually to/from people is
polis/political
The study of the cause effect and cost effectiveness of any communications
might be called Politics.  Then, again, it might be called Rhetoric.
Now and AGAIN, it might be called Poetics.
When such moments roughly related to Aristotle strike, I try to remind
myself that Aristotle was after discursive power, in need of throwing off
Plato, struck by a categorical imperative that would, in the fullness of
Hericlitan time,travel under names like Hegel, Kant, and yourselves.

In any case, when one says poetry is political, nothing much has been said.
Neigh pa, it's just the old Trojan Horse fucking around at Oedipal
and editorial crossroads making us mulishly repeat old saws.  Whether in
French or cross-linguistically, poetry and politics partake, punningly,
of more references than one would wish to police--in this lifetime.
Both terms, it seems to me, participate in a general effort to get from
this one here to you all out there; both, intimately involved in choosing
or bearing an assigned ethos/position, involve us everywhere and all the time.
Once again to mistranslate, Jacques Derrida, there is no outside to the
interstices. For this condition poetry--rather poetics--and/or politics is
a prodcutive moniker, if not a proper name or useful category.  No?

Conclusions:  Attitude and positioning factors in writer-reader relations,
i.e.specifics of attempts at organization or re-organization of
political relations in writing-reading, most likely open-ended
discourse as description/hermeneutics of LangPo.
Attempts to descry
a common style, characteristics etc, characteristic biographies,
 reinserts LangPo in the discourses that it seeks to oppose:  there's
something!  an opposition of discourses, something positive to get on
with.  Seekers for definitions need to ask themselves a lot of
questions about the epistemology (I typed * epistewmology *) and the
systems of learning and their protocols implied by DEFINITION when
applied to materials not easily subjected to Cartesian mathesis, i.e.
the human sciences, arts (as we understand them).

The thing to do is to begin reading and check out what is happening
in the reading.  L=etc  magazine is obviously crucial.  If anyone has
read through that, the question of definition probably could not
arise.

Is the purpose of definition to create a category of experiences in
literature that can be explained BEFORE the texts themselves are
attempted?   I'd begin with Peter Seaton's THE SON MASTER and his
critical writing as well, just to begin with something tough
to read...

It is an interesting fact (as CB has indicated) that several exacting
NYC "Language Writers" are not on this list.

Public Works announces its first publication:


Spanish Poems

by Elizabeth Burns


This sequence, excerpted in Mirage Periodical, of poems originally
written in Spanish, finds the poet drawing, Beckett-like, on the
directness of another tongue to articulate herself through difficulty
in the most plangent lyric. Burns translates herself back into English
at the foot of every page. The Spanish reads like a primer text
for beginning students to the language, so one can feel one's way with
the aid of the translations. Its statements, of course, would appear
in no existing primer text for teaching Spanish; they are passionate
and surreal and political all, and their respect for the way that the
surface of language, and the digressions of surrealism, can in fact
lead one to one's subject, rather than the other way around, brings
contemporary American experimentalism in touch with Spanish poetry,
promising some of the important cultural exchange already in place
with current Russian poetry.

Subscribers to this series, including forthcoming work by Juliana Spahr

As I'm reading Bakhtin at present, I was surprised to hear him called
'pernicious.'  Is this because (in Marxist fashion) his politics
exceeds his poetry?  Or is there some other gripe?

I like Mike Boughn's formulation (poetry is political, religion:
aesthetic, etc.) about forcing of once category of human activity
to signify in terms of another.  I assume M. means it as a point
against so forcing poetry, escpecially allowing it to be subsumed
by the political.

It's just because 'politics' seems so able to swallow the world
that I want to jam poetry in its mouth and dare it to swallow.
Isn't this part of what Charles Olson, Susan Howe, Rosemarie
Waldrop, Walt Whitman, William Blake, et al engage in their
poetry?

Subject:      Throttling

From Kevin Killian:  I don't remember what poets we read in school.  The
book we had to read was called "A Separate Peace."  But I remember being
furious and moping around my parents' house when Time magazine said Frank
O'Hara had been killed by a dune buggy on Fire Island.

I was very pouty for weeks & my dad said, "Why don't you write to Louis
Zukofsky?"  I perkled up & asked him who he was.  He didn't really know,
but LZ had been on the same TV program (NET) that O'Hara was.  "And plus,"
he said, "he lives in Port Jefferson.  And he's always writing letters to
the editor" [of our nearby paper, The Port Jefferson "Record"]-"complaining
about this or that."

Well I got on my bike, I was like 13 or 14, and headed to Port Jefferson
which was about 10 miles away and went to the house of Louis Zukofsky.  He
would always write letters to the paper about traffic in front of his
house, etc.

He was not happy to see me-I don't think he cared for school children.  I
was about 13.  He was a mean curmudgeon, but the garden was beautiful to my
eyes.  I resolved as soon as I was old enough to get a drivers license, to
take a big station wagon and drive right through his hedges, in the middle
of the night.  I think my brief encounter with Zukofsky colored the rest of
my reading of him, ever since.  "99 Flowers" indeed!  He wouldn't have had
1 flower left if I had had my way!  Luckily my childhood anger faded by the
time I was 15 or so and started to drive.  I didn't meet any other poets
until I was about 17 and met Paul Blackburn in New York.  But Alex Haley
did come to our classroom & told us all about writing the "Autobiography of
Malcolm X."

I'm reading this over & I'm, like, stunned at how stupid I sound.

Re Linz's I mean Lindz's recent swipe. I have a hard time gettinmg
around the idea of Atwood or Marian Engel as postmodern writers. As a
novelist, Atwood is primarily a writer of comedies of manners, and
quite happy to go along with agreementsd that we agree on the values
and referentialities of wqords and syntax. Engel wrote mainly
fictions about an individual who was trapped in conflicts and
situations caused by her environment. Neither of them was much into
constructing fictions but rather happy to pretend that fictions were
kind of synechdoches of life.

I hate to be the bearer of this kind of bad news twice in such rapid
order, but I have just learned that Don Pullen died Saturday of lymphoma.

Don was one of the great pianists and composers of our time, and, like
Julius Hemphill, he was a great friend of poets and a supporter of
communities of writers.  He was only 53 when he died.  As a soloist and
as the leader of a series of remarkable jazz groups, Pullen recorded
prolifically and he has left us a body of work that we will be listening
to and thinking about for generations to come.

I agree with what you've said about Atwood and Engel, but I've read a
couple articles that have classified both these writers as post modern.
Possibly this is due more to the time in which they are writing rather
than the actual style and content.  I also really liked Ryan's answer.
As usual he smacked me on the nose with some thing witty and thoughtful.

Hey George, it's Linzed not Linz, remeber.  See you at Art's, and hey is
Bill really picking up the tab, or is that some rumor Ryan is spreading?

Ryan ,
        I was at the other end of the table holding up Reg, so I missed
this conversation. WhAt exactly do you mean by feminine discourse?  Are
you refering to the concept of Herstory?  I was just talking to someone
the other day hos I have been taught to accept the first person male as
the typical narrative and therefore my sense of language is dominated by
masculine words. Of course this is less obvious as English appears to
neuter.  I seem to remeber discussing this before online and I like that
it keeps coming up.  I'm reading Ondaatje's Coming through Slaughter at
the moment and although it is mostly written from the male perspective,
he does sometimes slip into a female voice and I find it very effective.
I know I have more to say but it's too early, we'll pick this up later.

I would like to call attention to a worthwhile new magazine, currently in

learned a lot from _Talisman_'s model of providing pluralism,
unpretentious production, and a passion for innovative writing.
The mag's title comes from Pound's "Vorticism" essay: "The work of art
which is most 'worth while' is the work which would need a hundred works
of any other kind of art to explain it. . .Such works are what we call
works of the 'first intensity.'" Subscriptions are $17.oo per year
(2 issues), payable to Lee Chapman, P.O. Box 140713, Staten Island NY

Ed, I think we'll have to disagree about Bakhtin, and maybe about
the meaning of the term "theology" too, since I don't see Jung,
who I certainly would classify as pernicious, in that light whatever.

But I'm interested in what you mean by the phrase "seeing movement
in the work as in the experience as namable rather than merely
manifest."

Without anticipating your response to that interest -- I mean it as
a query -- I would just say that "manifest" as you use the term
is to me a theological term, if a term of Greek theology and
perhaps also gnosticism rather than of Xtian theology.

To "manifest" I would not oppose "namable" but rather
speak-able, subject to commentary, to response, to something
further. Reading, again to me, is this "further" or "other"
and it makes and remakes the poem which is not an object
(again, to me) but a subject, a speaking being.

James Thomas Stevens' poem TOKINISH, hovers over the abyss between one
language and another, one culture and another, one body and another.
Taking his cue from Roger Williams' dictionary of Narragansett, _A Key
Into the Language of America_, Stevens (whose Mohawk name is Aronhiotas)
discovers, or re-collects, America at the moment of catastrophic
translation, which is both *agon* and *conjunctio*, and in whose
lingering wreckage we make our uneasy homes.

_Tokinish_ was co-published by First Intensity and Shuffaloff books. It
sells for $7, and I would imagine that it can be ordered from either Lee
Chapman or Mike Boughn, who is on this list. If anyone wishes to email
Lee, her address is Leechapman@aol.com.

i haven't yet seen Stevens' book, but hope to now, as i'm currently
enjoying Wosmarie Waldrop's _A Key Into the Language of America_,
which also jumps off from Williams' dictionary, but w/ a very
different (relatively recent German immigrant) tho praps not
inconsistant perspective...  recommended.

Dear Tom Mandel, in response to your post yesterday: Yes, Lee Chapman
is also the publisher of _Tokinish_ by James Thomas Stevens, under
the imprint of First Intensity / shuffaloff books in 1994. Stevens,
a Native American (his Mohawk name is Aronhiotas), has written (as
Rosmarie Waldrop has also done recently) a poetic response to
Roger Williams' _A Key into the Language of America_ (1643).
Williams, a clergyman who is considered the "founder" of Providence,
Rhode Island, was a church renegade and attempted in _Key_ to
document the language of the Narragansett people. "Tokinish" is
a Narragansett imperrative meaning: "Wake him."

tom: in previous, "understand" should be "sure." whether "manifest" is/is not a theological term, as such it is an act (not, as the Big O would say, wisdom). as to poem as "speaking being," ahhhhhhhhhhh, there's too much "i" in that, for me.

Lindszed, what i meant was, or what i was thinking about was,
the kind of syn-tactics you find in Susan Howe.  the idea
being that Cordelia stands to inherit herself fromthe king

I both love and hate Ed Foster's imposed limitation of 3 lines of text;
love it because of the implosive intensity it forces on him and because
of the simple fact that his posts are short not long; hate, because
I keep wanting a more extensible dialogue. I don't, for example,
mean by calling a poem a subject rather than an object to impart an
ego to the poem.

I wasn't throttled. Sure, I had to read Longfellow and didn't like it
much. At home about the only poet to hand was R.L. Stevenson, and my
father loved "Requiem," and so did I as a young boy. Somehow, early on, I
found Dickinson on my own and she has remained a major influence. I
remember in high school, when I began to write (age 14) liking Keats and
Tennyson (the Tennyson of In Memoriam and a few short works, not the
Tennyson of Idylls of the King). I still think Tennyson can make the
language sing and at his best does not overdo it (although his best is
perhaps not as prevalent as his worst). First poets read in college were
W.C. Williams & Ginsberg, so, I'm afraid, not much throttling. Then
studies in linguistics just seemed to open everything up. It still is.

That's good to hear, since we've got more than enough ego and egos
surrounding all the work.


I might add that I'd like to take credit for the paragraph I posted on
_Tokinish_, but the truth is, I lifted it off the back of the book.

        I never liked Cordelia all that much in Lear,  Will never painted
her fully in my mind and he wimped out at the end by having her die.  I
know she's commonly considered the" redeemer", but in that sense she
loses her feminine aspect.  Her character and actions are masculine, just
as Goneril and Regan.
        A piece I've always liked but puzzled over was Tennyson's The
Princess, inparticular " The Woman's cause is the Man's"

                For Woman is not undeveloped man,
                But diverse: could we make as the man,
                Sweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,
                Not like to like, but like in difference.

computer virus has been engineered by a user of America Online that is
unparalleled in its destructive capability.  Other, more well-known
viruses such as Stoned, Airwolf, and Michaelangelo pale in comparison
to the prospects of this newest creation by a warped mentality.

What makes this virus so terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that
no program needs to be exchanged for a new computer to be infected.
It can be spread through the existing e-mail systems of the InterNet.
Once a computer is infected, one of several things can happen.  If the
computer contains a hard drive, that will most likely be destroyed.
If the program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed in
an nth-complexity infinite binary loop - which can severely damage the
processor if left running that way too long.  Unfortunately, most
novice computer users will NOT realize what is happening until it is far
too late.

Luckily, there is one sure means of detecting what is now known as
the "Good Times" virus.  It always travels to new computers the same
way in a text e-mail message with the subject line reading simply "Good
Times". Avoiding infection is easy once the file has been received - by not
reading it.  The act of loading the file into the mail server's ASCII
buffer causes the "Good Times" mainline program to initialize and execute.
The program is highly intelligent - it will send copies of itself to
every one whose e-mail address is contained in a received-mail file or a
sent-mail file, if it can find one.  It will then proceed to trash the
computer it is running on.

The bottom line here is - if you receive a file with the subject line
"Good Times", delete it immediately!  Do not read it!  Rest assured that
whoever's name was on the "From:" line was surely struck by the virus.

Spencer,

My service provider, sirius, who may be sadistic in their customer support,
but who has lots of online support, says this goodtimes virus is a hoax.
They even explained how it was impossible for it to work the way it's said,
but I deleted the message that said this because--why not?  My mind,
unfortunately, works the same way with most facts--like they're some hoax
to be deleted.

     -----

     Too little known Irish poet Brian Coffey died on Good
Friday, 14 April 1995. Born 8 June 1905, his father
Professor of Anatomy (and first President, 1904-1940) at
University College, Dublin. Baccalaurate in Classics 1924,
studied Chemistry Mathematics and Physics at UCD (master's
degree in 1930), research in Physical Chemistry in Paris in
early 1930s, gradually switching to "the philosophical
problems which arise out of any fundamental research." Works
with Jacques Maritain 1933-1936. Meets Samuel Beckett,
London 1934; begins doctoral studies on Thomas Aquinas,
Sorbonne 1937 (completed 1947); meets Joyce at Beckett's,
1938: as he later wrote, "in that quite informal atmosphere
he profited, as the young always do, from the opportunity to
see and listen to an eminent elder in unpremeditated action,
but he felt no deire to follow up the chance encounters."
Works mainly teaching school till 1972, when he retired,
with a brief interval as Assistant Professor of Philosophy,
St Louis University MO 1947-1952. Learned printing 1966 and
established Advent Press in 1967, published work by Dennis
Devlin and others (including himself). Translator of
Mallarme (Coup Des Des), Neruda, Bonheur, Eluard, Nerval,
etc etc.

     A representative sampling of his work is in the Brian
Coffey issue of the Irish University Review 5.1 (Spring
1975); his Selected Poems (1983) are (I think) still
available from The Raven Arts Press, 31 North Frederick
Street, Dublin 1, and his long poem _Advent_ (1986) might
(like his _Death of Hektor_) still be available from Menard
Press, 8 The Oaks, Woodside Avenue, London N12 8AR,
distributed by SPD. Harry Gilonis has recently (1994)
published the pamphlet _Salute/Verse/Circumstance_ through
his Form Books, 42A Lowden Road, Herne Hill, London SE24 0BH

_Advent_ occupies a place in Irish writing similar to
that occupied in English-language poetry at large by
Bunting's _Briggflatts_ and Oppen's _Of Being Numerous_.
Another major poet who we only learn to read after he's
dead.

Agree that is awful news about Don Pullen. Anazing to think that he
was just that young. I thought he must be 60 by now. God, the way
that man illuminated the 60s and 70s! Especially during that time

cris--

well, i like where this is going, & yes fr openness/access--but if
by 'masonry' you mean structure, i think that a well-thotout
framework actually _increases_ access, rather than limits... and
my initial response, not thot thru very hard, is that a separate area
for swaps makes more sense to me, rather than adding that to TRee
(tho hotlinks from TRee to a swapshop would be possible, & easy to
implement).

one goal of TRR is to get books noticed, _bought_, & read, knowing
firsthand how hard that middle step is, & how necessary for the
survival of micro-presses.  conversely, despite the generosity-bordering-
on-cheerleaderly tone of many of TRRs "blurbs", we do sometimes pan
a book, & i'd have reservations about direct connections to distribution
systems potentially influencing editorial decisions...

& my most immediate problem, i suppose, is time--after i finish
formating the remaining backlog of reviews (approx 1200 separate
documents), my next priority will likely be adding links from
individual reviews to samples from selected titles...  plus
continuing to edit the next paper version, & a few other sideprojects
like the dayjob...

To Cris, Ken, Luigi, and others,

Just looking over some of the exchanges over the topic of an online
swap shop. I think it's a good idea, as others do, as the discussion
has developed.

Both points of view of course are right, it should fit in to the press
listings and it could be separate!

Here's my point. The staff here is incredibly heavily worked. I would
be willing, if someone wanted to take responsibility for the creation
of a monthly list that would be sent to me or Ken (we can work that
out) as an e-mail message. Then it could be posted in the EPC under a
menu item say, "Publisher's Swap List." Are the interested publishers
wanting to swap everything on their lists or selected items? The list
could just be (1) a list of publishers or (2) list of publishers and
titles offered for swap. At the head of the list could be the e-mail
contact for publishers who wish to be added or subtracted from the
list.

Whew, seems a terribly laborious project. Maybe the solution is for
all interested publishers to put up their own press home page in the
EPC!!! This is an area that could use a good shot in the arm. You
could have a note in your home page that indicateds you are interested
in exchanging with other publishers.

There are great possibilities for press home pages. (As you may know
the EPC had what - 8,000 - transactions in Feb.?) You can set up a
press home page with minimal effort, including a graphic, etc. BUT
SUCH A PAGE SHOULD BE UPDATED REGULARLY. In other words, send a home
page to me to get going. When you want to update it send an updated
home page ("Updated Home Page for X Press" in subject line) so that I
can simply replace the previous home page.

Thus, swaps would be accommodated, orders could be instigated, links
from the massive and extraordinary TapRoot project could me made...

Are you with me?

All best,
Loss

Hey, Lindzed,
If _Lear_ had been a regular comedy, Cordelia would have married at
the end. As it is more like a tragedy, she has to leave this plane,
just like Desdemona and Cleopatra. Them's the rules. So it wasnt
because Shakespeare was a wimp; it was because he was a hightone
Elizabethan playwright.

        I don't really think of it as being successful as a comedy or a
tragedy, but as the lack of development of a female character.  Desdemona
has the same mystery around her and probably the same amount of lines,
but she is never given motive.  We never know why she's willing to
disobey her father to marry Othello.  One of the better female portraits
presented by Will, I'd say is Volumina.  She has depth and strength,
possibly this is a result of her Roman background.  I think what causes
me to think of Will being a wimp is that when he has the chance to do
great things in portraying "liberated" free thinking women, he kills them
off and we end up with the Mirandas. Shakespeare seems to be more
concerned with crossdressing than really attacking the politics of a
female monarch.  I'm not really a fan of Will's plays, I sort of pick out
the good speeches and never got beyond that, I really prefer his sonnets.

Thanks for your note. I recently got the idea of doing what the young
methodical historians dont do, going to the sites and describing
whatever traces I can find in the ground, places where mines used to
be, etc. I recall that either Herodotus or Thucydides did that. I
cant remember which,. I can only remember that Olson claimed that one
of them did, and some historian I was talking to, 25 years agho, said
no, it was the other one. But really, has Olson ever been mistaken?
Jeez!

This could be done. It would still involve presses establishing and
maintaining their press home pages and would also allow complete
linkage to other EPC resources.

My error, Herb, and thanks for pointing it out, in the Sabbatean
antinomian blessing, which should read:

        Blessed be the Lord our God, King of the universe,
        who permitteth that which is forbidden.

It might also be translated "which permitteth" as the rabbis
tried to avoid formulations that would anthropomorphize God,
often inserting the phrase "as it were" where the language led
them to such forms -- this despite God's showing Moses his
ass in the desert.

In-Reply-To:  <199504270425.AA13382@mail.eskimo.com>

Hi -

Just thought I'd comment on the recent evolution of the recurring
distribution discussion.  It's a little long, but it's been paragraphed
for easy consumption.

This thread began with someone, Rae Armantrout I think, saying that they
wished that people she knew could find her new book (Made to Seem, which
as several others have said, is quite good) in stores.

After being seconded by several others, this quickly became a series of
complaints against SPD's ability to place books in stores and a list of
the great poetry book store in the US.

For the sake of those who got here late, this list seems to be Woodland
Pattern in M'woky.

At least one person who said SPD never seemed to get their books into
stores said that SPD was also a major source of income, without which they
could not continue.

Someone else said that most stores end up buying at least the larger small
presses through Consortium, not SPD.  Someone else noted that many of the
books sold in the US at least, are sold through the mail.

The remains of the thread, as they continue to this day, have been taken
up with hammering out the details of a way in which writers and publishers
could trade publications with each other.

This is fine, and I may be the only non-writers, non-publishers here, so
this may be sour grapes, but doesn't it avoid the original issue?

Oh, well, we'll just get this work to its audience by using the always
glamourous INTERNET.  Of course, how could I be so naive!

As Loss Glazier notes there is a great potential for home pages.  Still, I
don't think putting the work on the WWW and calling it good is the answer,
certainly not for the next few years anyway.

It's great that EPC is getting 8,000 hits a month.  But this isn't very
much considering how many people are on the internet.  & It's not very
much compared to what a lot of home pages get.

& when you consider how many of these hits are people looking for
something weird to show their friends how they've mastered the
WideWorldWeb, this number seems even worse.

"Hey, Stevie, look at the weird thing I found on the net last night.  They
said it was a poem, but I can't make any sense out of it.  It's not about
how when their lover left them it reminded them of their first pet dying."

In the long run, yeah, the internet may be a way to get work to more
people than are going to find their way to it now.  And it makes sense to
be ready for that.

But most people, even most people who are interested in the kind of poetry
we're interested in (add that to the thread on <definitions>), despite how
nice & cozy it feels here on <poetics-list>, are not on-line.

And they won't be for some time yet.

So, now that you've got a better system of trading publications between
writers and publishers started and you're ready for on-line distribution,
how are you going to get the work in front of people NOW?

Just thought I'd ask.

Bests,

Herb Levy

I should have sent this together with the below but I couldn't find it
yesterday.

There's a traditional Jewish prayer called the <Shechecheyanu> (pardon my
transliteration).  It's said whenever you do something for the first time,
seasonally (eating your first fresh tomato of the year) or more
universally (birth of a child, etc.).

I couldn't find the translation I grew up with, but it's roughly as follows
(dropping the archaicisms past the formulaic opening): "Blessed art
Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sustained us and
allowed us to reach this time."

In combination with the blessing from Shabtai Zvi that Tom Mandel cites,
these cover an awe-ful lot of what's interesting in the world, no?

Ron,

Forty percent of all books sold in the US are NOT romance novels.
Approximately 94% of all books sold in the US are text books.
Of the remaining six percent, four percent are non-fiction, one and
a half percent are fiction, and one half of one percent consists of
all other book publications (including, of course, poetry).

I feel, too, that somebody should plug Small Press Traffic in
San Francisco.  They carry all the good stuff that SPD in
Berkeley has become too elitist to bother with, i.e. chapbooks
and new lit journals.  I discovered Spenser's work there, Dan
Davidson's, Generator Press books, Score Press books, etc., long
before SPD carried them.  Small Press Traffic has led a pretty
precarious existence, but they're interested in literature before
its been embalmed, and if they survive, they won't be dumping
their chapbook publications in order to make shelf space as
SPD in Berkely has.

Let me restate that last: they won't be dumping their chapbook
selection in order to make shelf space for University Press Publications
as SPD in Berkeley has.

Small Press Traffic is a nice place to go rummage amid the new.

Thought I mention it in case there's someone reading this that
(Death to all line editors)
Thought I should mention this in case there's someone reading
this that doesn't worship at the altar of the perfect bound book.
Anybody out there remember Doones Press?  Excellent early titles
by Ron and Tom Raworth and others, all memeo and staples and
hard to find.  If you're "in the business of selling books"
then you shouldn't be publishing poetry.  If you're in love
with poetry and you publish it for that reason, there are always
alternative ways to readers.

Ron, most of this hasn't actually been addressed to you, but I
do have a question, aren't major writing centers interior?

Best,
Jonathan Brannen

Noted that Cris mentioned Harney and poetry as though they were enemies.
George Julian Harney, should you not know, has the distinction of being
the first working class communist as well as the publisher of the first
English translation of The Communist Manifesto.  Harney was in fact a
reader of poetry.  Byron seems to have been his favorite, but his
personal library contained volumes of poetry by others as well.

Dear Academics:

The following is a forwarded message calling for two papers: one on Olson &
one on Creeley. Dig how they want you to drag Wittgenstein into the latter.

Poets, sorry, they don't care what you think. Groove on paragraph 5's
"... please submit ... standing at your institution (MA 2, PhD 3, etc.), and
any other information you feel would better inform us of your commitment to the
study of contemporary American poetry." (!?!?)

I don't know about you folks, but I'm just going to Xerox Olson's "Letter
for Melville 1951" and submit that.

Hugs & big comfy sweaters to all,

Gary

Seeking respondent for panel at M/MLA Annual Convention in St. Louis,
November 2-4, 1995.

We are involved with a panel new to this year's Midwest Modern Language
Association Annual Convention:  "Mimetic Ends:  Representational Shifts
in Post-WWII Poetry".  In order to ensure a dynamic exchange of scholarly
views, we seek and welcome potential respondents from other universities.

Respondents are welcome for two papers in particular.  Charles Olson's
position on the cusp of postmodernism and the philosophic scope of his
poetic ideology offer his work as an instructive site for theoretical
analysis.  The paper to be present attempts to move Olson beyond strict
phenomenological re-readings and into a discussion of the material
implications of Olson's "projective" economy of image.  The second paper
will explore the work of Robert Creeley as influenced by William Carlos
Williams.  A reliance on Wittgenstein's writings should offer a unique
reading of Creeley's response.

We hope to select a single respondent for these papers.  The respondent's
primary responsibility is to prepare a ten-minute response designed to
promote discussion for all in attendance at the session.  Ideally, the
respondent will be able to bring the papers into dialogue with each other
and with the broader concerns of the panel (two other papers will be
presented).

If interested, please submit a brief letter summarizing your principal
scholarly interests, standing at your institution, (MA 2, PhD 3, etc.),
and any other information you feel would better inform us of your
commitment to the study of contemporary American poetry.  Address letters to:

James Zeigler - Dept. of English
601 S. Morgan St. (m/c 162)
Chicago, IL  60607

Direct any questions to either Zeigler at (312) 281-7109 or Pat Roberts
at (3120 989-7918.  We will reply to all who express interest and the
selected respondent will receive paper drafts by August 31.  The selected
respondent will need to join Midwest Modern Language Association prior to
the conference.

Thank you for your interest.

GREETINGS from the remote antipodes of Cyberia. The Write
Stuff has evolved out of a weekly lit-crit newspaper column I
used to write ('88-'92) and the desire to promote good writers
and writing in the most eclectic sense. We ain't peddling no
critical creed -- Giles Hugo

IT seems not too much to expect that readers of fiction and
poetry might also be users of the Internet, and that to use
this medium to point back to the printed world of books and
writing can only be of service to writers and their readers.
I hope this proves to be so! -- Anne Kellas

Dear Jonathan:

I hate to be the messenger of this, but I'm told Small Press Traffic
closed. Yes, it was a great place. The first time I went in I thought "is
*this* the bookstore Brautigan was writing about in _The Abortion_?"
People literally brought in books they had made, sometimes in editions of
like five copies. (Including me.) The best press name I ever saw was in
SPT: "The Photocopy Machine at Work."

They also, thanks largely to Kevin & Dodie, had what I thought was the single
best reading series in the Bay Area. Also, also, they used to put out a
newsletter every couple of months or so w/brief reviews, etc.

Them days, sadly, are over. Or, so I'm told. Unfortunately, you're right:
"If you're 'in the business of selling books' then you shouldn't be
publishing [or otherwise making available] poetry." (That's not true,
though, in at least a few other countries.)

Yours,

Gary

the conception of who "we" are, and "the kind of poetry we're interested in",

_TapRoot Reviews_ appears first, & primarily, as a traditional paper
publication (the various electronic versions contain only a subset of
the information in the the paper version); and the reviews therein
are primarily of _paper_ publications, on the premise that those
publications are most accessible to "people NOW."  the use of new
technologies does not necessarily imply the abandonment of the old.

& conversely--the _potential_ for online communication/distribution
far exceeds the present reality of traditional hardcopy dissemination
of info.  sure, that potential is not yet realized, and limited techno-
access is still a barrier... that's no reason not to lay the groundwork
now for future possiblities...

As of three weeks ago I am now Small Press Traffic's (only) employee, a
very part-time (paywise at least) position.  SPT hasn't had an employee for
two months.  Officially I am the manager, but since there isn't enough
money to hire a director, directorship duties are planned to be performed
by myself and the much-overworked board.

A couple of poets I recently talked with didn't know we still existed.
We're now housed (meaning we have two bookcases) at Lodestar, a (very nice)
new age bookstore in the Castro, on Noe at Market.  Much of the store's
stock is in storage in Colma.  SPT's mailing address is now 2215-R Market
Street #449, San Francisco, CA 94114.  Voice mail:  415/281-9338.  And, of
course, I can always be e-mailed.

Financially, things are in a crisis state.  Unfortunately, this is true of
many arts organizations in the Bay Area (Intersection just did a major
lay-off of their staff, for example).  The board is trying to come to a
decision as to what to do, to just put it in its grave, to downsize, to
become a presenting organization (i.e., get rid of the bookstore, which has
never supported itself).  I would like to see SPT continue to be involved
in distribution in some way.  I think the ideas expressed here about online
distribution alternatives are very exciting.  I would welcome any
suggestions from any of you on the listserv, concerning directions to take
the organization.  We're having a Saturday board meeting in two or three
weeks to discuss SPT's direction.

Though we no longer have a space for readings, I've recently been given a
grant for a reading series to administer.  Once I figure out what exactly
it is that will fulfill the grant, hopefully SPT will be able to continue,
for a bit, to present some interesting readings, at who knows what
location.

I've been involved with this organization since the early 80's.  Writing
workshops at SPT, and the literary community that gathered around it
changed my life.   Your kind words about the organization are deeply
appreciated.

Subject:      Re: Malls, Mail and Romance

I loved Small Press Traffic, but it shut down earlier this year
(reduced actually to four shelves in a new age bookstore in the
Castro). Shut down in part by stock that never turned but ate up
capital in the form of shelf space. The largest debtor was SPD.

I do think a store like Traffic is do-able, but it has to be done
absolutely perfectly -- which is pretty much what Woodland Pattern
seems to be -- or else it will get sucked in by its own good
intentions. Carrying books on consignment for 15 years that never sell
is no more a form of distribution than is doing a terrific four-color
perfect bound book that the publisher keeps in the garage or basement
and never advertises.

The idea of SPD as "big, exclusive" or whatever seems to me
preposterous. They aren't perfect but they continue to do the job,
carry lots of non-perfect bound material, and have managed to
accomplish the most important task of all -- to stay in business
without having to depend entirely on a charismatic leader selflessly
supporting the store itself out of some other source of $$.

Imagine what poetry would be like without SPD?

full list context at that time) you'd have read that it was in fact
focussed onto Helen MacFarlane, being the first translator of the Community
Manifesto published in Britain by Harney (which was mentioned  -  what's
your point?) in his (and I dated the issue in which he did so as well) The
Red Republican, and onto her translation.

            My point, although I did list and credit Harney fully, was
about her translation having added a somehwhat idiosyncratic 'image' (of
the 'hobgoblin' stalking europe) into the firt line of The Community
Manifesto and of how this (and I know I was being ironic) had set up a
mutual suspicion between Marxist Revolutionaires and poetry lasting until
this day.

Nothing in that post suggested animosity between Harney and poetry. I'd
have been irresponsible indeed if I had. But you arguably responded
'irresponsibly'  - to get back to an earlier strain.

There  -  that's my bristling tetchiness for this week gone. And since
bones are being picked among bristles your phrase 'the distinction of being
the first working class communist' is useless in any respect other than
provoking questions of how do you know? card carrying membership number 1?
there were other communists before him but they weren't really working
class ( such as O'Brien)?  well maybe they weren't exactly communists? or
did I miss a definition there? and so on. Cause he's also been called 'a
Jacobin in an English setting'. Marx and Engels quarrelled with him and
were suspicious of the catch-all attitude towards 'revolutionaries'
generally embraced in his internationalist editorship of The Red Ruplican.

Come on. Let the record what?

And this is really tedious list-clogging stuff.

Subject:      Real men read hardware poetry

I work in a warehouse in San Diego and I hear a lot of daytime
radio.  The latest commercial theme for some hardware store chain
(I forget who it is) is poetry.  The first commercial I heard
with this theme had a man reading a poem about wood.  He seems
really uncomfortable reading the poem, like he can't believe what
he's doing.  As I remember, you can even hear him turning a page
after reading one line.  Maybe he's supposed to be nervous.  My
own sense of the guy's nervousness is that reading a poem is not
something that men who work with wood do, or admit to.  But the
man's voice also has that kinda-mumbling monotone that has become
a fixture of many radio commercials (much like the wandering,
jerky camera shot was once so entrenched in television
commercials), so maybe his delivery is supposed to be "cute."

The second commercial at least has a pun.  The voice over says
that this man is going to read his "concrete poem."  And, of
course, the guy starts reading (again with a sense of self-
consciousness) a poem "about" concrete.

Makes me want to yell out, "Pinch me, Alfredo and pass the hot
sauce!"

Ron,

Thanks for reminding us that selfless acts never go unpunished.

I don't think anyone would suggest that Small Press Traffic
is/was a model business venture.  Nor do I believe that this
is/was its driving motivation.  I also hesitate to assign a
shelflife to any book.  I've found marvelous books in various
places that have been eating "capital in the form of shelf
space" for more than fifteen years and have been delighted
that someone had the foresight or, as you suggest, was
negligent enough to keep them available.

I agree that SPD performs a valuable service.  The only
"bookstore" where I live is a greeting card shop run by
apostolic christians who promote family values.  So SPD
is something of a life-line.  But if you believe that SPD
still carries "lots of non-perfect bound material" you're
living in a time-warp.  I can't fault their business acumen.
They've defined their market niche and seem to be effectively
pursuing it.  SPD is settling gracefully into middle-age.
Along with increased knowledge and comfort with the status quo,
has come the fear of risk-taking.  SPD can't meet everyone's
needs.  They continue to do part of the job and this in itself
is admirable.

"Imagine what poetry would be like without SPD?"  Probably not
much different than it is.  It strikes me as preposterous
to suggest otherwise.  Would you start writing differently
if SPD ceased to exist?  Poetry finds a way to survive and
to evolve (more often than not, outside of official channels).

Best of all possible worlds,
Jonathan

Gary -- You need to take a closer look at that M/MWMLA circular you
circulated to us -- They are not asking for papers applying Witt. etc. to
the poets etc. -- Those papers are already on the panel, and the chair is
looking for someone to respond to them!  In which case the Olson letter
might make a good start indeed!  Wild thing about that conference is that
they circulate papers in advance, and the audience is supposed to read in
advance and come prepared to argue (my experience has been that this
system does not hold up in practice)

But what do those numbers after the degree abbrevs. in the line on status
portend?  Am I a 2 or a # or do I add up to a five???? what is 1 to do?

who publishes some editions with artists/papermakers limited to as few as
50, but also publishes some editions of 1000 which are, as of yet, never

Dear Aldon:

Thanks for correcting me on that. When they said they were looking for
"respondents" to two papers, I really thought they were looking for
people to respond by *writing* these papers, which had been sort of
boiler-plated as to subject & approach, & as such sort of already
existed. It totally did not surprise me that an academic institution
would ask for such a thing. (It still wouldn't.) That was, in fact, how
we we asked to write a number of our papers when we were in school. (One
teacher, if you didn't write about, say, Hemingway, using this sort of
vaguely "Jungian" approach he'd developed (& used in class), he'd dock
you points. That was, as far as he was concerned, how you read a thing,
and if you weren't reading it on/in his terms, you simply weren't
"getting it." (It involved finding "the line" and "the circle"; whether
someone was drinking alcohol "the spirit, masculine" or water "nature,
the feminine.") For a year after that class, that's how I assumed
everyone wrote, what they thought about. (I'm admittedly impressionable.)

Now, those numbers after MA and PhD, God knows what they stand for. A
color TV for the first person who posts the answer!

Yours,

Gary

Dear Ron:

>The idea of SPD as "big, exclusive" or whatever seems to me preposterous.

Shakespeare: "Nothing can seem foul to those that win."

As a publisher whose various projects have been carried by SPD since
1990, and as a poet who does not have a chapbook out or forthcoming, I
hope you won't find my opinion of SPD the product of imagined
exclusion. I agree with Jonathan: SPD simply doesn't carry very many NEW
chapbooks, & new chapbooks by emerging writers in particular. The reason
they don't carry them is their exclusionary policy: A press must be
publishing at least 2 books a year, and the books must be "sellable" to
bookstores. Again, if you know someone there, and they like you, they
*may* take your stapled books on. Or, if you're publishing writers who
people already know about.

Yes, SPD is valuable, a very valuable resource. But they aren't what they
were in '80s. They're pretty much as Jonathan's described them.

Now, as to:

>Imagine what poetry would be like without SPD?

I don't have to; I know where to get Standing Stones, Texture, _Compound
Eye_, & dozens of others I don't have time right now to list. (My server
just notified me they're going to reboot. Thanks, Ron, for warning us
about that, btw.)

Yours,

Gary

Jonathan makes good points about Small Press Traffic and SPD. And Ron is
right when he implies that there were problems with the way Small Press
Traffic was run. Best thing about the store, in my opinion, was the
reading series Kevin Killian put on. And this is the greatest loss.
(Kevin, you must start another series soon. The scene misses your
events and needs them badly.)

It is certainly true that SPD has moved away from carrying material that
is not perfect bound. The most active chapbook presses of the past five
or so years, such as Leave, Texture, Runaway Spoon and Standing Stones,
are not carried by SPD. (I believe they have taken a title or two from
Leave, but not most of their list, which includes around 60 chaps.) This
is significant because it is these presses that are publishing most of
the emerging writers. It is to these presses and others like them that
emerging writers must increasingly turn if they are to begin publishing
books.

One of the reasons why Taproot Reviews is such a valuable publication is
that it carries so many listings of magazines and chapbook presses that are,
for the most part, not distributed by SPD.

It would be terrible if SPD folded; I think everyone will agree on that.
But that does not mean we should ignore or deny the downside of changes
SPD has made over the last 5-10 years. This downside becomes more and more
significant as a new generation of poets struggles to find publishers and
an audience.

No, but for the past 6 years I've been living one block east of SPD and
have bought saddle-stitch books there as recently as this week. (Julia
Blumenreich's Meeting Tessie, to be exact, which has a prominent place
at the front table, right near Rae Armantrout's perfect bound Made to
Seem and the new Palmer New Directions & Duncan's Selected Prose). SPD
has sold all of Zasterle Press' books and a number of others as well.

But I must admit that SPD's focus is not the micropublisher so much as
the small press. Non perfect bound books have a different form and
function -- they're the perfect mail object and when I get a big
package from Leave Press (as I did this week) it makes me ecstatic --
the Giscombe there caused me to walk to SPD and buy his Dalkey Archive
book _Here_.

Having said all this, I must admit that I'm moving 3,000 miles from SPD
in the next 45 minutes.... It will be the Bay Area institution that I
miss the most.

Just to echo Ron's excitement at receiving the Leave pamphlets in the
mail. I received these last week as well, and they are marvelous. Thanks,
Juliana. As to the micropress, stitched pamphlets in SPD or other
bookstores, I wish there were more everywhere, but I even think that, in
the context of most bookstores they are rather lost, whereas they are so
convenient and not terribly expensive, to mail. Getting them in the mail
is a wonder rarely found in a bookstore. Perhaps, then, there is simply a
need for more access to finding out about such works so that more people
can order them or trade for them. I think this list and other electronic
forums are already helping in that regard.

1. Loss says online swap shop listings should fit into both press listings
and be separate. I'd also agree with that.

2. It does seem as if work needs to happen from the press side on
constructing of home pages. Now I'm very willing to be put in the work on
doing that, but feel nervous on the techno side. Loss, I take it you need
this info in HTML  -  am I right? That's where my own, and I think I might
not be alone on this, technophobias emerge as my knowledge of HTML is
pretty much limited  -  as yet. But I did find what Bob Drake posted in
that respect very useful. And the www site for 'A Beginner's Guide to HTML'
is worth a quick visit for downloading what is a very useful (though still
to me daunting) introduction to the 'language'.

In one way Loss what would be a useful exercise for me would be to put in
the s-nail to yourselves the kind of info I'd like a home page I might
design to accomodate and then get e-back about viability. (I'm not
suggesting for a minute that you do any of the work - you're all and both
and all doing a great job already !).

I'd just like for you to see the stuff more tangible so that when we talk
marmot there's some 'concrete' ground.

3. Bob - thanks for your response. What remains useful is the positive
energy and intent to gererate new possibilities which this discussion is
apart of.

4. Herb  -  doesn't my taking (for the sake of argument) books I have
swapped with X Press along to a reading series in Norwich or London or
Cambridge already suggest a way in which what was not previously put before
'a public' can become so? It's only a litle one but it gets close to the
source and turns up the heat a touch.

In a recent letter Jonathan Brannen said "Forty percent of all books
sold in the US are NOT romance novels."
This means that 60% ARE romance novels. I find that hard to believe.
I thought that at least 25% were gun manuals.

Well, maybe Shakespeare was a populist in those days, but he's
hightone now. I would be amazed were I to find (a) that the average
freshperson could understand the lingo, and (b) someone on the
average B747 were reading Shakespeare, much less the average AM/TRAK.

Hi Cris,

     Relax Cris, your use of irony was so subtle that it was
lost on no one.  And yes, you mentioned the date that the
Communist Manifesto was published in the Red Republican.
You were even gracious enough to include its retail price
of one penny.
     My point was that Harney, a revolutionary in his day,
was an enthusiastic fan of poetry.  Either this
extends the irony, since Harney was responsible for the
publication of "A frightful hobgoblin stalks through Europe",
or it points out the questionable nature of generalities
such as: "Resultant mutual suspicions between revolution
and poetry have been a struggle ever since."  Mutual
suspicions, as used in your post, does suggest a degree
of animosity.  But if it makes you feel better, sign me
up for the next Glee Club sing of "Call Me Irresponsible."
     I had intended to type that Harney "has the distinction
of being one of the first working class communists...."  I
assume full responsibility for my shoddy proof-reading.  Glad
it provided you with the opportunity to vent the last of
last week's spleen.
    But Harney was indeed one of the first working class
communists.  Is this useless information, as you claim?
If you already know who Harney was, I suppose it may seem so.
But George Julian Harney is hardly a household word.  I felt
it was a unfair to mention him as though he warranted only
a footnote to Helen MacFarlane's translation of the Communist
Manifesto which you held up for derision.  There are those
who believe Harney played a note-worthy role in disseminating
Marxist philosophy to the working class at a pivotal point.
     Did you miss a definition of communism?  Since it was
Harney's publication of the Communist Manifesto you were
discussing and all remarks about Harney were made in that
context, I'd say you didn't miss it, you were willfully
ignoring it.  As for card carrying, I believe Harney's
game was chess.

            Hi Jonathan, if you'd read my original post carefully (in its
full list context at that time) you'd have read that it was in fact
focussed onto Helen MacFarlane, being the first translator of the Community
Manifesto published in Britain by Harney (which was mentioned  -  what's
your point?) in his (and I dated the issue in which he did so as well) The
Red Republican, and onto her translation.

            My point, although I did list and credit Harney fully, was
about her translation having added a somehwhat idiosyncratic 'image' (of
the 'hobgoblin' stalking europe) into the firt line of The Community
Manifesto and of how this (and I know I was being ironic) had set up a
mutual suspicion between Marxist Revolutionaires and poetry lasting until
this day.

Nothing in that post suggested animosity between Harney and poetry. I'd
have been irresponsible indeed if I had. But you arguably responded
'irresponsibly'  - to get back to an earlier strain.

There  -  that's my bristling tetchiness for this week gone. And since
bones are being picked among bristles your phrase 'the distinction of being
the first working class communist' is useless in any respect other than
provoking questions of how do you know? card carrying membership number 1?
there were other communists before him but they weren't really working
class ( such as O'Brien)?  well maybe they weren't exactly communists? or
did I miss a definition there? and so on. Cause he's also been called 'a
Jacobin in an English setting'. Marx and Engels quarrelled with him and
were suspicious of the catch-all attitude towards 'revolutionaries'
generally embraced in his internationalist editorship of The Red Ruplican.

Come on. Let the record what?

And this is really tedious list-clogging stuff.

  Stirred by this week's babble about SPD:

    To be clear from the beginning, my views are in no way aimed at
  the replacement of print culture, books, broadsides, xeroxed zines &
  staple-job chapbooks/literature by digitized versions, or TV, or
  something. No need to resist what I have to say with that charge or
  fear. There are teen & adult spirits & beauty (synthesis, etc.) about
  print which I hope never meet extinction. Especially appreciated are
  poetry & other books which have visual elements and qualities to
  them (from Illuminated manuscripts through Blake (much more like
  "poetry" than the Declaration of Independence), DADA & up through
  Katie Yates & Brathwaite & so on). There are certainly titles
  published by Chax, Leave, Roof & other presses mentioned around
  here which are of unquestionable value to the pro/motion of poetry
  & the poetic(s) arts into the next century. Long may those presses
  run (to strike a paraphrase). So, if you can bear with it:  what I have
  to say is non-oppositional, though querulous.
     Once again I want find it necessary to promote alternative
  publishing platforms (though I noticed my brief comments on the
  subject were omitted from the transcript of the New Coast session on
  small press publishing which was published in CHAIN vol. 1). I
  experience a mild dismay realizing that the primary focus of poets,
  as far as producing their work goes, remains tuned to print
  technology. Since it is what we are accustomed to, what we have
  easily at our disposal in our age of commercial & pirate xerox
  reproduction? But can we hang a moment to problematize "print"?
  Any way you want? I was talking with a close friend last night, 30
  April 1995, a very intelligent woman who said, "it's a failure of the
  imagination to think that poetry has to be limited to black words on a white
  page." That sounds harsh, "yeah," but the idea that most printed poetry, as
  much as it might contain beauty and meaning via language, is far from
  always best enacted through book technology.
     I have actively been involved as a small press publisher (&
  "writer") since 1986, putting out approximately 27 print volumes (+
  broadsides), a half dozen or more cassettes, one compact disc, a video,
  and 1+ magazines/newsletters on the internet as co-editor with We Press.
  It's especially ridiculous to me that SPD will not carry items in unprinted
  media because their "purchase points" and warehousers can't find a way to
  handle them conveniently. So, we're out on that level. (Which is fine,
  actually, considering that when I hear Ron Silliman say "Imagine
  poetry today without SPD..." I think, gee, look at / who's looking at
  American Poetry today with SPD!). Audio recordings we have already
  published by Jack Foley & Adele Foley, Joanne Kyger, Tory Miller,
  Jean Gier & Sybl Glebow, Eric Curkendall, Andy Clausen, H.D. Moe,
  Richard Kostelanetz, Richie West, Allen Ginsberg, Jennifer Joseph,
  Marc Olmsted, Teresa Clark & Carletta Wilson, Dashka Slater, Jennifer
  Stone, Francisco X. Alarcon, Morton Marcus, Richard Loranger, Angela
  Coon, Elisabeth Belile, Victoria Stone, Michael Weaver, Anne
  Waldman, Nathaniel Mackey, William Everson, Trudy Morse, Cecil
  Taylor, Wanda Phipps, Lee Ann Brown, Steven Taylor, Victor
  Hernandez Cruz, Steve Benson, Roddy Potter, Katie Yates, Stephen
  Cope, Will Alexander and others are circulated through "grass-roots"
  methods & the occasional indie-music distributor, though the people
  who buy & support "independent" music distributors generally want
  more than a voice in their ears.
     To a certain degree, I'm wondering what Dr. Perelman says in his
  upcoming book about the marginalization of poetry. Whether we
  need to be marginalized, want to be marginalized, or are necessarily
  marginalized, it seems like sticking close to printed text ensures just
  that in our audio/visually based culture.

April 1978, Barrett Watten in L= mag.:

"IF at some point language walked in the open door, we would show it
some respect.  Our response would be more immediate than to use it as
a sign.  A sign of respectability, or connections to the art world.
So we respect language by not being content to operate in any one
part of it.  it's greater than we are.   This has implications for
the form.   That sense is larger than one can say."
