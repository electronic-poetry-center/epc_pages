*Old Romanian Fairy Tales*
*Salon, June 29, 2012*

*Interpretive Reading, Friday, 7pm.*

Fairy Tales originated in myth and have been integrated in different
cultures from time immemorial.  Over the years, Fairy Tales have lost their
important role as a vehicle for idealistic values and morality in the
development of culture. The earliest European Fairy Tales have always dealt
with good and evil in the heroes and characters, with goodness triumphing
in the end.  Derived from ancient civilizations of the Celtic and
Greco-Roman traditions, the present book of English translations, entitled *Old
Romanian Fairy Tales*, captures and conveys indigenous Romanian folklore.

You are invited to join us for a fabulous evening where you can meet Prince
Charming and have a drink with the fairies, witness battles with dragons,
betrayal, competition, love, and observe ultimate success in the
interpretive readings of four four Romanian Fairy Tales.

Greetings, daytimers and desk-slaves! We at /Unlikely Stories: Episode
IV/ are thrilled to present new poems by Michelle Greenblatt. Back in
the 'aughts, Michelle was a rising poetry star in the small press,
before she took a six-year break from publishing. She's back, now, with
three great poems, slated to appear in her forthcoming book /Ashes and
Seeds/, and presented at www.UnlikelyStories.org now. Right now. It is
there, along with:

Andy Bichlbaum and the Yes Labs offering free McDonald's to "Stop and
Frisk" victims
Jay Driskell examining the activist debate over the Wisconsin recall
Marti Hiken and Luke Hiken considering U.S. troops as victim,
victimizers, or both
David Cobb on the Tea Party, Green Party, and righteous anger
Dominique Desjardins on the student strikes in Quebec
Arturo Desimone on his visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau center
"Dreams In Time:" a full-length novella by Eric van Hall
More Fiction by Rudolfo Carrillo, George Sparling, and J. Edward Vanno
More Poetry by Dan Raphael, Louise Landes Levi, j/j hastain, Billy
Cancel, Jay Passer, Kim Vodicka, Joh Grochalski, and William Aaron Tanner

There's more great stuff coming up mid-month, so enjoy this now, before
like, you forget, I guess. Do you forget things? It's OK. Everyone does.
You should not feel bad about it.

See you in the comment stream,

The Save Our National Schools campaign have launched a new video with a new=
 take on the Pink Floyd hit "Another Brick in the Wall", which they have to=
ngue in cheek retitled "Another Kick from the D=E1il", with altered lyrics.

Featuring footage of and a chant from students of two Westmeath schools, th=
e video is launched to highlight the march outside Dail Eireann this coming=
 July 4th, 2012 to oppose the pending cuts and amalgamations of small schoo=
ls in rural areas.

The video is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DWIdm98Zb6oQ - if you can c=
omment, tweet, share on facebook, post on your blog, or better still turn u=
p to the protest, that would be fantastic.

From 2001-2004, a periodical called "The Philadelphia Independent" was in c=
irculation around Philadelphia. Run by Swarthmore grad Matt Schwartz, the I=
ndependent was a quirky mixture of arts (including poetry in each issue), p=
olitics, "urban particulars" of various kinds, and idiosyncratic takes on P=
hilly life. Now, many of the best Independent issues are available to be re=

[apologies for cross-posting]

Dear All,

For those interested in Clark Coolidge, or in Willem de Kooning, I'm
v. pleased my article on both has appeared:

"Glancing paintings and poems: figuration and abstraction in Clark
Coolidge's Polaroid and Willem de Kooning's Excavation"
Textual Practice
Volume 26, Issue 3, 2012
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950236X.2012.658434

If anyone wants it but can't reach it drop me a note.

Yours truly,

Sam

p.s. Abstract below:

This article reads, in parallel, Clark Coolidge's Polaroid (1975) and
Willem de Kooning's Excavation (1950). It argues that both are
exemplary meditations on the tension between abstraction and
representation, and display that tension as an affective struggle that
ultimately refuses any easy conceptualization of =91abstraction=92 or
=91representation=92. The argument bears on their reception. As =91New York
School=92 artist or =91Abstract Expressionist=92, de Kooning worked at the
biting point between figuration and abstraction. Coolidge's reception
in the discourse of Language writing imputes a lack of referentiality,
which this article critiques. Polaroid presents the qualifiers,
pronouns, spatial prepositions, and deictic pointers that typically
determine the coherence of the representational scene in the mind's
eye. Here, however, the parts of language that facilitate meaning
become the parts that resist recognition. The tension between our wish
for context and the reticence of the artwork to fulfil that craving is
compared to the context reticence of Excavation. The term deixis is
given to describe the reception of both paintings and poems, and
foregrounds the corporeality of the viewing subject, thereby refusing
the possibility of a final abstraction (or lack of referentiality).
The force of the comparison is paradigmatic of strategies of
interdisciplinary reading generally.

Portland-based poet Kaia Sand teamed up with magician and
master-whistler The Magnificent Mitchelli to produce "A Tale of
Magicians Who Puffed Up Money that Lost its Puff."

It's a rollicking poetic magic show about the financial collapse of
2008 that they staged in December 2010.

ically and also writing about them--it's sort of a hybrid class between Int=

hat they attend a poetry-related event around town this month. =A0Would you=
 know of any others by chance? I know there's some lunchtime events at the =

"In a civilization of hysteria, the sentimental man is king. Troubadoured
constructions have laced our European balconies with a string of rotting
roses. Emotion=92s event horizon is the condensation of clich=E9. Love is b=
oth
an autonomous quality of the world and a conditional quality of our
language. Extend a convention far enough and one arrives at life. Shall we
explore love then as rhetorical device? The flowers among your hair are
mere metaphors. Upper limit hyperbole, lower limit litotes. Kitsch and the
commonplace set up the steps of the dance. To then trip over tropes is to
attain a glittering singularity among stars: a stasis amidst the movement.
Rhetoric and sincerity do not cease to be distinguishable; rather, their
distinction no longer matters. Beyond the baroque and the rococo lie the
limits of this spectrum, where all passion is at once passion and its show,
all *pathos* at once *ethos* and its mask of Venetian glitter. The
aesthetic posture and persona of our over-the-top Romeo takes then to
moving while still sobbing in a comical *cabriole*. Let the tropes dance
then, the ones amidst the others, and interchange forever their silken,
saddened arms." *=97Nicholas Manning*



*Homo Sentimentalis: A Guide In Verse To Modern Emotional Intimacy* is

Certain Circuits Workshop:  Creating Collaborative Multimedia Poetry
(Saturday, August 4 at Big Blue Marble Bookstore)

Founded by artists, Certain Circuits Magazine publishes poetry,
experimental prose, art, and new media. We are especially interested in
documenting multimedia collaborative work between artists. Our two print
issues feature work from artists in Australia, Brazil, France, Mexico,
India, Japan, Korea, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
 Our collaborative work in text, print, and exhibitions has been documented
by Arcadia University Bulletin, Apiary, City Paper, Duotrope, Et Al
Projects, Fifth Wednesday Journal, Moonstone Arts, New Pages, New Purlieu
Review, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philly Side Arts, Philadelphia Weekly,
Spew Jersey, Tyler Fiber, and Urban Arts Projects, among others.

Editors Lora Bloom and Bonnie MacAllister will guide you through the steps
to create and score your own multimedia poetry .gifs and videos. The
workshop will consist of creating new work through a series of multimedia
poetry prompts and composing to the original music of Bloom.  Participants
will perform their texts in the workshop setting, and they will learn free
and easy animation techniques. Final products to be eligible for submission
to the magazine.

Lora Bloom writes poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and abstract rants,
and is a musician and performance artist.  Currently she is the lead
vocalist of the experimental rock band Radio Eris  and she helps run Eris
Temple Arts, an art gallery and music space in West Philadelphia.  She has
been recently published by 13 Myna Birds, received a prize for her writing
by the Beat Museum, was featured at the 25th Anniversary of the Shubin
Theatre, and has performed and curated music and poetry widely in Europe
and the United States.

Bonnie MacAllister renders moments through a variety of media. Often pieces
are multi-genre, fusing painting, photography, slide installations, spoken
word, video, and performance.  She is a Pushcart Prize nominee, poetry slam
champion in the United States and France, and Fulbright-Hays awardee to
Ethiopia.  Her poetry has been published in Esque, 10,000 Poets for
Change/Fieralingue, Grasp (Czech Republic), nth position (UK), and Paper
Tiger Media (Australia). She has performed her original writing and plays
at New York Foundation for the Arts, the Philadelphia Fringe Festival,
Raandesk Gallery in Chelsea, Adrienne Theater in Philadelphia, and Cat Cat
Club in Paris. She is currently showing work at the Sandy Spring Museum in
MD.

Hi,

In just under a month, to mark our 21st anniversary, we'll be putting
on our sixth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music festival,
featuring poets, musicians, political speakers, public radio
personalities, and playwrights performing at two venues, in two
boroughs, over four days, from Thurs. Aug. 2-Sun. Aug. 5.

For details on the over 70 poets, musical acts, political and radio
talks; the seven poets theater plays; workshop; and panel, visit the
facebook event link:

http://www.facebook.com/events/415332255184488/?ref=ts

About a week before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue
of Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the
performers. Here's what lst year's looks like:

http://boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc69.pdf

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
via our electronic and physical issues more than 5,500 readers, poetry
lovers, and small press aficionados throughout the East Village, other
targeted areas of lower Manhattan; Williamsburg and Greenpoint,
Brooklyn; and throughout the United States; as well as bonus
distribution at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our
regular issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a
program for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they
check to see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130

      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/adrates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails, Boog City focuses on getting the
word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa
Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and recent Pulitzer Prize
winnr Tracy K. Smith, alongside our music section, small press book
reviews, political commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area and beyond.

as ever,
David

*

Save your life.  Last night in the kingdom of ends and it IS ALL A HOT
BECOMING medium anthemic hoping for it, love.  Recollection=92s yellow
diamonds in the light is the only happy one, yellow DIAMONDS REPEATING,
your recollecting that and loving it and willing to love it.  Pill sex
clockwork montage montage.  Or at least, standing side by side the possible
kind of love-repeater that is semiautomatic trigger shift and back from
tragedy to farce,  all new unhappy cases, hopeless in being not like some
primary-hapax love loop infinity pool with piped-in chorus as your shadow
crosses mine.  What it takes to love is not disturbed by hope, but is it
disturbed by love even. NO EXPRESS NO EXPRESS NO EXPRESS what it takes to
come alive disturbed by hope is impossible, so how can we hope for the love
it holds for us on a priori file in amber ice

SHOULD A SUITABLE position become available, returning all the bad stuff
don't recoup it.  When we find love in a hopeless place, do we find it
there ALL HALF-UNWILLINGLY like Childe Roland who didn't sleep long enough
for content to rearm an eponymous repetition or in spite of the going.  Is
there something in the ontological terroir or the Terror of the love that
we find in a hopeless place that renders even it ineluctably hopeless.  And
then do we know when we find the love that we are in have gone to a
hopeless place or is finding the love there that sign, lasciate is the love
portable, can we take it with us is the question repeating it above THE
CHORUS, NOW SCREAMING it but no one can hear.  What hope is there for a
love so found when commitment in contingency is the sawbuck where we love
to work our hope, where hopefully thinking as far as possible to what
extent I can from the impossible position one-step removed from my own life
which is hopeless is love which is hopeless my heart leaping out of its
chest

   =E2=80=9CWhen I woke, I found Octavio Rima with his severed head in his=
 lap and
   Leche de Amour with a thin glass shard through her chest, I myself was
   no bargain or sight for sore eyes, with my front teeth on my lap like
   little chicklets with bloody roots. I thought: Let me write one more
   poem, one more poem that I will dedicate to Rios Juliano, the mad
   Joycean from Madrid, the one who fishes sonnets and sombreros from his
   window.=E2=80=9D

   =E2=80=9CPeople look at me and expect big things from my writing. They=
 see a
   black gay guy with immigrant parents and think, Here=E2=80=99s someone=
 with
   something to say. For a long time, before I discovered Beattie, I
   thought so, too. I tried to write about gay hospital visitation and the
   Eritrean-Ethiopian war=E2=80=94admittedly, in the right hands, possibly=
 great
   things to read about, but in my hands they were wrong. The characters
   fell flat=E2=80=94oh, they fell real hard=E2=80=94because they were mer=

   an agenda that wasn=E2=80=99t mine. Still, I knew I had something to sa=

   =E2=80=9CBradbury wouldn=E2=80=99t have made it today as a writer in Ne=
w York; he was
   too rough, too raw, too tender. (He attributed to New York critics a
   =E2=80=98terrible creative negativism.=E2=80=99) But Ray Bradbury, who=
 never went to
   college and was entirely library educated, had what so many of the
   sophisticated, MFA-carrying writers today lack: passion, vitality,
   emotional awareness. And, maybe most admirably, he found a way to carry
   his imagination past the boundaries of childhood, where so many of us
   so often discard it.=E2=80=9D

[8]Dear The Paris Review, What Books Impress a Girl?

ressGirlBooks072012

   =E2=80=9CThe correct answer is probably that your friend should be secu=
re in
   his tastes, find someone who loves him for who he is, and not worry
   about impressing anyone. Many movies have demonstrated the pitfalls of
   posturing and the inevitable public unmasking that follows ... Then
   too, there is the dual nature of the question: Does the author wish to
   come across as a poseur for some reason, or attract a woman of
   substance?=E2=80=9D

>DIANE SIMMONS' short story collection, Little America, won the 2010 Ohio State University prize for fiction. Her story, Yukon River, was a runner-up for the 2010 Missouri Review Editor's Prize. Her novel, Dreams Like Thunder, won the Oregon Book Award for Fiction. Along with another novel, she has published critical books on Maxine Hong Kingston, Jamaica Kincaid, and popular British Imperial writing. She grew up on the high desert country of Eastern Oregon. After a career in journalism in the West, she moved to New York City, where she teaches at the City University of New York.

>BURT KIMMELMAN's seventh collection of poems is The Way We Live (Dos Madres Press, 2011). He has also published five books of literary criticism, including The "Winter Mind": William Bronk and American Letters (1998) and scores of essays on medieval, modern and contemporary poetry. "Taking Dinner to My Mother," a poem from his collection As If Free (Talisman House, 2009), was featured on NPR's The Writer's Almanac. Recent interviews of Kimmelman are available online: with Tom Fink in Jacket2 (text) and with George Spencer at Poetry Thin Air (video).

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CLight on the Lion's Face=E2=
=80=9D by Tim Van Dyke
Description:
The poems in Tim Van Dyke's =E2=80=9CLight on the Lion's Face=E2=80=9D are =
composed in conjunction with Jean Baudrillard's book, =E2=80=9CSeduction=E2=
=80=9D, often using fragments from the text as architecture for the poems. =
The other two architectural concepts are the Shivite myth of K=C4=ABrttimuk=
ha (or "Face of Glory"), a story about a ravenous lion eating its own body,=
 and the stylistic renderings and fragments of Aime Cesaire. Tim Van Dyke u=
ses these three points of departure to fashion a new sensibility about the =
body, love, seduction, society, and the continued relevance of myth and rit=
ual.

Arpeggio

When I reach my cabin fifteen minutes later, a rust-coloured deer is
standing right in fron of it as if waiting for me. When she sees that I
see her, she runs into the woods. I resent her all month for appearing at
such a clumsily symbolic moment, on that is unusable in writing, as if to
taunt me, she doesnt show herself again.

1.

Le Chantecleur or coq, au vin. Dipping my feet at the edge of the lake.
Pascale tells me the hotel poisons the lake, pours liquid in. Im indignant
in orange lifejacket. Wet curls. We found no evidence.

I lose my contacts in the lake. The fish mumble. Wake from water blur
faced and metal.


2.

To next fleur, chanson or chocolaterie. A cake my family ate in square
portions, Cadix. The baker moves away and wont teach the new owners how to
make it. We adjust our palette. Settle for butterflies on chocolate crisp.
Le Papillion.

Not simply some acres of snow.


3.

Lake swans, lake boats, only thats not here thats there. Thats a ride at
some park. Here there are paddleboats. My feet get hit if Im not paying
attention. I pretend swans.

I have never been on a train.

4.

Late songs on the deck.  Leaves, the yard spreads. A table of water.

Bare back to wood.

The Last Collaboration by Martha Deed with Millie Niss, originally
published online by Furtherfield.org/friendsofspork is now available in
book form through Amazon in the US and the UK.

Amazon has activated the "Look Inside" feature so you can have a peak.

Call it â€œa demonstration/ project,â€ as the opening to this collaboration
suggests, by two authors, Martha Deed, a mother accompanying Millie
Niss, her daughter, to doctors and hospitals, which is to say from one
medical disaster to the next, till the daughter is dead and the mother
is left with the heart-breaking task of burying the daughter and
completing the project. The result is a back and forth from present to
past, through diaries, emails, drawings, poems, medical reports, and
handwritten notes, sorting to find out and be clobbered with the errors
that led relentlessly to the death. Those who have been there will
appreciate Deedâ€™s conveying the words and images in the chaotic way they
come at us and we sort them. Those who have not been there will be
convinced. All of us will learn, thanks to Nissâ€™s courage to keep
writing and to Deedâ€™s clear-headedness in meaningfully finishing what
must have been a painful, mind-boggling task.

Hi All,

Im interested in picking up one or two freshman comp classes for fall. If
anyone's department needs someone last minute, will you let me know?
I am interested in some place within an hour commute of Greenpoint
Brooklyn. I have six years high experience and three years freshman
comp experience, two books, awards and all that jazz. I would actually
prefer to teach a disabilities studies class, but I know those are hard
to come by.

Love, Jennifer

Friends, I'll be in Port Townsend, Washington as afternoon faculty this
coming week (July 15th through the 22nd).

I'm teaching the following workshops Monday through Saturday (descriptions
below): Hybrid Forms/Mongrel Selves; Art as a Point of Departure;
Contrapuntal Collaboration; Writing with Scientific Thought; & The Sensual
Infrastructure Between the Abstract and Concrete.

Check out the schedule, and please pass along to friends, colleagues, and
students that you think might be interested.  It looks to be a very full
week at Centrum.

Best, Deborah Poe

*
The Sensual Infrastructure: Between the Abstract and Concrete*
As prose and poetry writers, we will reflect on how one can improve writing
by way of deftly balancing abstract and concrete language. By weaving
abstract and concrete language through spatial description and sensory
details, readers are able to connect to stories and poems more deeply.
We=92ll consider how bridging the abstract and tangible does not merely
provide a descriptive function. Such bridging engages readers more directly
intellectually, psychologically and emotionally with the importance of your
work. This year's focus will be on fiction.



*Writing with Scientific Thought*
We will reflect on how one can use science to inspire creative writing. By
looking at writing samples from such writers as Arthur Sze, Czeslaw Milosz,
Primo Levi, Italo Calvino, Andrea Barrett, Bernadette Mayer, and Rikki
Ducornet, we=92ll consider how established writers use scientific ideas in
their own work. Though our focus is not an introduction of scientific terms
per se, we will use scientific thought as launching pads for creative
writing, generating work during the workshop. The workshop is designed to
provide new channels to access new work. This year's focus will be on
fiction.



*Contrapuntal Collaboration*

There are three major definitions of contrapuntal. It=92s the melody added =
as
accompaniment to a given melody or =91plain-song=92.  Contrapuntal refers a=
lso
to the art of adding one or more melodies as accompaniment to a given
melody or =91plain-song=92 according to certain fixed rules (the style of
composition in which melodies are thus combined). Contrapuntal can also
mean a combination of two types of rhythm in a line of verse.
Palestinian-American
critical theorist Edward Said, himself a pianist and music critic, wrote
extensively about how *literature* can be contrapuntal. We will talk a
little bit about how literature might be contrapuntal. We will focus on
writing pieces that possess a keen attentiveness to prose rhythms, poetry=
=92s
musicality, and the contrapuntal. We will focus on ways in which thinking
about the contrapuntal during our creative process might impact the
meaningfulness of our work.



*Art as a Point of Departure*

What is the difference between using art as a point of departure versus
ekphrastic writing=97writing that describes artwork? What is ekphrastic
poetry? What is not? If you use different mediums=97film, other books, soun=
d
art=97how does that change the use of art as a point of departure? In this
workshop, we will reflect on the use of art as an instigator for new work.
But we will contemplate how the joining of ideas, research, ideas of the
artist, and a focus on various mediums can produce different kinds of
pieces than straight ekphrastic poetry.



*Hybrid Forms/Mongrel Selves*

In this workshop we=92ll use the words hybridity to think about creating
pieces that embrace multiple genres at once: prose poems, flash fiction,
narrative that looks like poetry, etc. Some examples from which we might
discuss excerpts include: Maggie Nelson's *Bluets*, Natasha Tretheway's *Be=
yond
Katrina*, Akilah Oliver's *A Toast in the House of Friends*, Rebecca
Brown's *Excerpts from a Family Medical Dictionary*, and Anne Carson's *
Plainwater*.

Subject:      reminder: rob's new editing service: poetry manuscript reading,
              editing, evaluation

For a few years now, I've offered a one-on-one poetry editing/evaluation
service, and have decided to expand.

I'm STILL offering, to anyone interested, evaluation, editing and otherwise
help with shaping a poetry manuscript for potential publication. I'd be
thinking a series of back-and-forths, including notes, questions and
revisions. $200 for a manuscript up to 100 pages, or $250 for up to
150 pages.

If you are interested, send me an email at rob_mclennan@hotmail.com.

It has been a while since I've run poetry workshops at Collected Works
Bookstore and Coffeebar, but I've run nearly a dozen poetry workshops at
the store over the past decade, and run other workshops and manuscript
evaluations through my Writer-in-Residence position at the University of
Alberta (2007-8), through Encounters with Canada, and as part of the
(late, lamented) Ottawa Valley Book Festival, as well as editing numerous
books over the years for Broken Jaw Press, Vehicule Press, Insomniac Press
and Black Moss Press, and my own Chaudiere Books and above/ground press.

There's always a possibility that I might offer another poetry workshop.
Keep an eye either on this space or http://www.bywords.ca/ for future
announcements.

James Harvey=20
James Harvey (1966=962012) studied biology at UCL before becoming a full-ti=
me poet in the thriving experimental and innovative poetry community in Lon=
don .=20
His interest in science=2C especially biology=2C extended into his poetry. =
James took part in a forum discussion with Rae Armantrout=2C Amy Catanzano=
=2C John Cayley=2C Tina Darragh=2C Marcella Durand=2C Allen Fisher=2C Peter=
 Middleton=2C Evelyn Reilly and Joan Retallack on the interaction of poetry=
 and science=2C hosted by Jacket 2. He was fascinated by the potential of =
=91science in poetry to dismantle existing structures=2C and then put them =
back together again=2C build them up =93mechanically=94 while at the same t=
ime each level of complexity is acted upon equally through =93the forces of=
 nature=2C=94 questioning the integrity of the structure.=92
The importance of ecology in his work is evident in one of his best poems=
=2C =91Mackerelling=92. This was published in Veer Away (Veer 2007) and sub=
sequently became his first book (Intercapillary Editions 2009). The poem =
=91is a movement through water ... an exercise in naming as pattern=92. As =
James explained: =91Marguerite White sent me cardboard cuttings out in the =
shapes of sea birds she had used for one of her installations=2C I had been=
 watching David Attenborough=92s The Blue Planet and the idea for the poem =
came shortly after. At the back of my mind was also Bob Cobbing=92s poem =
=93alphabet of californian fishes=94 ... one of my favourite poems.=92=20
James was a regular at Writers Forum Workshop and many of his poems have a =
strong visual element=2C showing Cobbing=92s influence. Part of his poem =
=91Living Rock Ode=92 (in Freaklung 2010) included a diagram of a marine pl=
ankton that he sounded when reading the poem. James read in honour of Jenni=
fer Pike-Cobbing in 2010 with his work featuring in AND13 (Writers Forum 20=
10) produced to mark the event. Later he was part of Writers Forum Workshop=
 (New Series)=2C his work appearing in its first publication (Writers Forea=
rm 2011).=20
Veer published a chapbook Temporary Structures in 2009 and included his wor=
k in Veer Off (2008) and Veer About (2011) in addition to Veer Away. He was=
 published in the Openned magazine (2006) and Openned Issues 2006-07 (2008)=
. In 2009=2C Openned brought out an e-pamphlet=2C Parts Composers=2C and Ka=
ter Murr=92s press published a broadsheet From Marx=92s Capital. James was =
featured in the anthology In the Company of Poets (Hearing Eye 2003).=20
James=92s readings in London included the Blue Bus in 2008 with Nina Zivanc=
evic and Vahni Capildeo and in 2010 with Harriet Tarlo=2C David Miller and =
Ken White. He read at Crossing the Line in 2009 with James Wilkes=2C Jon Cl=
ay=2C Antony John and Out to Lunch.=20
James was also part of a group of poets who travelled to Newcastle upon Tyn=
e to celebrate Barry MacSweeney in a reading at Morden Tower in 2010. James=
 read from his Japheth series=2C written in collaboration with Edinburgh-ba=
sed poet Jow Lindsay. Other work appeared in Herbarium (2011)=2C also with =
an associated reading=2C or were published online in Greatworks and Jacket=
=2C with work also appearing in Brittle Star magazine=2C Poetry Salzburg Re=
view and the Morning Star.=20

Hi!

Sooo, I created a concrete POEM, then published it in a BOOK, then turned=

the poem into a T-SHIRT, then came up with a SONG about it in the shower,=

then shot myself singing it, then posted it to YouTube:

Happy mid-July, vipers, roosters, and others! It strikes me that this
week marks 14 years of publication of /Unlikely Stories/, in one form or
another. Don't let it happen to you.

Thanks to the particular efforts of new Art Director Jeremy Hight, we've
got a great new multimedia issue up for you at /Unlikely Stories,
Episode IV/! But first check out the latest release from Unlikely Books:
/guttural silk make new gong/, a chapbook by j/j hastain. This hot
little tome is available from Unlikely Books for just $5, or as a free
downloadable .pdf! Check it out at
http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/unlikely_books/ !

And at http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/ , we've got:
Sweet Visual Art by Jeffrey Vallance, Aimee Jones, and Joy Garnett
"The Human Mystery," a movie-story-game by Alan Bigelow
/Terrible Bonnett/, an EP from musician-slash-sound artist Philippe
André Landry
"Love Has Been Liquidated" by John Bryan, a 66-section
choose-your-own-adventure /A Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, even/
role-playing prose poem, in which you can play the near-helpless mute in
a completely fucked epistolary romance.
and Jonathan Penton (that's me) interviews the aforementioned Bryan

It is enjoyable, so go enjoy!

(And don't worry, my fowl friends. Those snakes are only after your eggs.)

Subject:      A short video about Aleph Null

About Aleph Null: http://vispo.com/aleph/video

This is a short video I put together about Aleph Null. Aleph Null is color
music. No audio. It's an online, generative, interactive, open source visual
work written in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas tag. No plugin required.

I showed Aleph Null recently in Paris at the Sorbonne at their And Now
conference on "innovative writing". There was a panel of three scholars who
presented papers on Aleph Null. And myself; I presented Aleph Null.

Aleph Null was also presented recently at the Electronic Literature
Organization conference in West Virginia. Again, three scholars--Leo Flores,
Giovanna Di Rosario, and Mark Marino--presented papers on Aleph Null and I
presented the piece--only this time I couldn't be there so they played this
video which I made about Aleph Null.

Aleph Null will also be presented in Boston at the 2013 MLA in an exhibition
of electronic literature curated by Dene Grigar and Kathi Inman Berens.

You might ask yourself why Aleph Null, which is primarily a visual piece,
not a 'literary' piece, has attracted such attention within specifically
literary communities. The 'And Now' conference is concerned with "innovative
writing" and the two other venues I mentioned are concerned with electronic
literature. Whatever your answer, the interest in Aleph Null in these
writerly venues has triggered interesting discussion about the relation of
such a piece to poetry and the writerly.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CSymphony No. 7=E2=80=9D by R=
ic Carfagna.
Description:
=E2=80=9CSymphony No.7=E2=80=9D is a poetic meditation on the passage of ti=
me. Each of its eighty-eight numbered sections begins by isolating and fram=
ing an image of a moment resonating through an empirically based terrestria=
l reality. Here it is known that each moment is subject to the quantum flux=
 of an observing mind=E2=80=99s cognitive awareness, and thus, each moment =
presented evolves according to the indeterminate and mutable potentialities=
 inherent in the nature of its existence moving through an experientially p=
erceived corporeal realm.
Available as a free ebook here:
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/SYMPHONY%20NO.%207.pdf

SMALL PRESS COLLECTION AT ENDICOTT COLLEGE



BEVERLY, MASS.


Doug Holder, Adjunct Instructor of English and head of the office of the
Ibbetson Street Press at Endicott College (Beverly, Mass.) has started a
small press book collection with the help of Brian Courtemanche Director =
of
Endicott's Halle Library, and his staff: Audrey Koke and Kristyl Roderiqu=
es.
Holder, a widely published poet, and arts editor of The Somerville News, =
has
long run his own lauded independent small press and literary magazine
"Ibbetson Street" from his home in Somerville, Mass. Holder has long admi=
red
the great small press collections at the University of Buffalo and Brown
University, and has always wanted to bring books of poetry, novels,
etc..from the vast and eclectic sea of independent presses from this coun=
try
and abroad to Endicott College. The Library's website now has a link to t=
he
collection:
http://www.endicott.edu/Academics/AcadResources/~/media/LibraryMediaLibra=
ry/PDFs/Ibbetson.ashx
and it will be updated twice a year. The books listed so far are only a
small portion of the books received.




We hope to have an extensive collection and we would love for you to be p=
art
of it. Send your donations to :

Hi everyone,

I wanted to let people know about the broadside Norma Cole & I have just
completed that is now available. I asked for artwork, Norma sent a collage
(named for a book by another wonderful poet/collagist, Tom Raworth), and I
responded w/a July poem. You can view the broadside & find purchasing info
here:
http://martin-cj.tumblr.com/post/27626272991/this-is-the-first-in-a-series-of-broadsides
.

Julia Drescher & I are launching a new fine press imprint called Further
Other Book Works, and this broadside is part of a series that I'm hoping
will allow us to raise some funds for the books we have lined up. More on
future titles later, but if you can purchase a broadside, it would be a big
help. They're ink jet prints (17"x22"). The edition size is 25, so there
aren't that many to go around. We're asking $40 + $8 shipping (if you're
outside of the continental US, shipping will be more). If you're interested
and would rather not use the paypal link on the page above, feel free to
mail a check (made out to me) to 200 W 55 1/2 St., Austin, TX, 78751.
Please feel free to contact me w/any questions.

Yours,
C.J. Martin

How nice to see "claptrap:, a word not enough used nowadays (we sure need
it). The condescension in that piece of claptrap is indeed mind boggling;
for better advice, see Jonathan Williams's sundry pieces to various
aspirants -- advice which actually IS useful, clear and well-written, as
well as genuinely friendly.

Indeed, Murat. The message is "If you're tough enough for our
gentleman's club (which you'll never be), we might deign to patronize
you at even closer range."

have a bass player. You wanna learn?" Jay was 13 and never looked =20

experimental prose, art, and new media. We are especially interested in
documenting multimedia collaborative work between artists. Our two print

 We curate our print issues from our online multimedia issues.

Now celebrating two years in print, our collaborative work in text, print,
and exhibitions has been well documented.  We have staged exhibitions and
film screenings of our contributors in conjunction with our print issue
launches, and we recently nominated six poetics contributors for Best of
the Net.  We look forward to nominating our artists for future prizes and
creating future exhibition and screening opportunities.

Please submit your best work in any genre (cross-genre and collaborative
encouraged) to certaincircuits@gmail.com: 5 pages of poetry, 1 page of
prose, no more than 5 jpgs, link to audio and video files, or link to

I second Doug's message.
As a special collections curator at a small college, I receive many
donations of publications.
Most authors are incredibly honored to have their work included in a
special collection, and few
expect to be paid for their books.  Of course, we do buy things, but there
are so many
works that we would never know about unless an author brought them to our
attention
and offered them to us. It doesn't demean the work to offer it to a
library. Having our work
preserved and cared for by an institution is a privilege that most writers
never get.
