We've just heard from NOLA poet Alex Rawls. ...

Alex & Kat are near Pensacola with her parents.  He has some news of
Bill Lavender and Nancy Dixon. As of Monday morning Bill was fine.
Monday evening Bill's son Will spoke to him and he was still doing good
(Alex is in touch with Bill's son and a sibling of Nancy's & will relay
any information as soon as he hears more).  Bill has a boat and the
keys to a friend's condo which is on the 3rd floor of a converted
warehouse not far away from his house. Alex would like to have some
confirmation that Bill is alright but isn't that concerned.

I wonder if this "converted warehouse" is the same as the "can factory"
I hear Brett Evans is staying in (from a 5th party). I know Brett and Bill
are friends....

You know, if they are alright, they're going to think this is hilarious
that we're doing this.

Yeah, I'm practically having a panic attack and Bill probably WOULD just chuckle about it! I'm still just so pissed at them for CHOOSING to stay! I'm SO glad to finally get some news about them! Has anyone heard anything about Claudia Copland, Jose Torres Tama, or Andy Young?

Thanks so much for relaying the news, )ohn!

my new mailing address is 1626 Virginia Road, LA, CA  90019

was in Florida for the early days of Katrina, of course nothing like the
devastation on the Gulf, but similarly many people without power; one of
the key pieces of advice one the news was to move "out of the blue
states" (away from the cities on the coasts)

For those who know them, I just found out that Andy
Young is in Mississippi, and that Claudia Copland,
Jose Torres Tama, and Jimmy Ross are headed to Andrei
and Laura's in Baton Rouge. YAAYY! I can't express how
relieved I am!  I just hope Bill and Nancy stay as ok
as they were Monday. God  this is such a fucking
nightmare.

Announcing BlazeVOX 2K5



This is our fifth year and we are pleased to be back up and running! After
several technological meltdowns our computers have behaved long enough to
help produce this wonderful gathering of writers. This international group
shows the strengths of current fictions and poetries. As, always we have no
theme to this issue, only a common bond that we have no vocabulary to
accurately express what cements our bricks together. So please take a moment
to stop on by and enjoy the weird writings of our acquaintances.

This issue is available three formats. As an online journal, a free, full
PDF e-book and a printed POD edition from Cafepress.com

I apologize for posting before I'd really learned of the extent of things in
New Orleans and the Gulf...(as the mother of a young child I tend to try to
keep a levee on the news flow around us)...I'm remembering Zora Neale
Hurston's descriptions of what I guess was the depression-era hurricane in
Florida -- that is what is informing me most as I see the footage....and
what is informing me of things I don't want to but of course already know is
all the cnn bobbleheads describing poor stranded people taking diapers from
abandoned  convenience stores as looters and bush described as heroic for
cutting short his vacation and looking out of a plane window for half an
hour.


As many will and no doubt are saying with more authority and grace, I feel
so mournful at this transformation of such an ornate, spiritual, particular
place---and the devastating upheaval and loss of life for so many.

hi all,

according to FEMA, "Monetary contributions allow the professional relief organizations to purchase exactly what is most urgently needed by disaster victims and to pay for the transportation necessary to distribute the supplies. Donations of money given to recognized relief organizations are tax deductible and allow the relief supplies to be purchased in locations near the disaster site. This stimulates the economy and ensures the supplies will arrive as quickly as possible."

hold onto the books for now and send your bucks...

U.S. Won't Relocate Soldiers for Katrina
September 01, 2005 10:04 AM EDT
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - There will be no large-scale shifting of U.S.
troops from Iraq and Afghanistan to help with disaster relief in Louisiana
and Mississippi, a U.S. Central Command spokesman said Thursday.

Lt. Col. Trey Cate said top military officials are exploring ways to bring
individual troops home to take care of families in need without altering the
balance of forces in the war zones.

But top commanders are unsure if homecoming service members can yet visit
areas stricken by Hurricane Katrina due to flooding and evacuations that are
under way.

"There are lots of different options of getting soldiers back there," said
Cate, who is based in Qatar. "We're going to do our best to take care of the
troops and their families."

In Baghdad, some 3,700 soldiers from the Louisiana National Guard's 256th
Enhanced Separate Brigade were preparing to return to their base in
Lafayette, La., after spending nearly a year in combat in Iraq.

The 256th is expected to begin the trip home within weeks, and would be
available for disaster relief at the discretion of Louisiana Gov. Kathleen
Blanco, said Lt. Col. Steve Boylan, spokesman for the U.S. military command
in Baghdad.

"They are not going to redeploy early as they are already in the process of
redeployment," Boylan said.

Navy Cmdr. Jeff Breslau, a U.S. 5th Fleet spokesman in Bahrain, said no U.S.
warships in the Gulf would be redirected to disaster relief in the Gulf of
Mexico, but individual sailors with family emergencies could be granted home
leave.

National Guard units called up for rescue work in Louisiana and Mississippi
had to make do without members currently deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan.

National Guard troops from Alabama and Wisconsin, along with other law
enforcers, were ordered to deal with the shortfall.

Most Americans identify the National Guard with providing emergency services
during natural disasters. But in the past three years, numerous Guard units
have been sent to Iraq to fight alongside regular forces.

The Louisiana brigade watched the disaster unfold on television as they
finished their nearly yearlong deployment to Camp Liberty, west of Baghdad.
The troops are expected to leave Iraq by November, if their deployment is
not extended.

Boylan said the Army was providing the Louisiana Guardsmen extra Internet
and phone lines to contact family and friends affected by the hurricane.

Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle agreed to send 500 Wisconsin National Guard troops
to Louisiana Wednesday to help out. The Wisconsin Guard itself is stretched,
with 1,700 members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and another 1,000
mobilizing for deployment overseas.

Blanco said she has asked the White House to send more rescue workers to
free up the 4,000 National Guard troops already in New Orleans to stop
looting and return law and order to the flooded city.

A brigade of Mississippi National Guard soldiers also remains in Iraq,
attached to the II Marine Expeditionary Force.

More than 1,600 Mississippi National Guardsmen were activated to help with
the recovery, and the neighboring Alabama Guard was planning to send two
battalions to Mississippi to help cover the shortfall.

Heard from Bill Lavender and Nancy Dixon last night. As John said, they're
safe. (Don't have internet at home.)

Andy Young is okay, as someone might have already said, but I just heard.

Roger and Moira were in NY when the storm hit.

Bill told me that he thought Brett Evans was still in New Orleans but was
"high and dry." Also that his companion was elsewhere when it hit (if I
remember correctly).

There was some question yesterday about Joel Dailey, but I hear (maybe on
the list?) he's great.

But "great" of course is pretty relative while they're looking at what's
happened and not knowing.

Are people finding other things to do to help with the relief after Katrina
besides sending books to poets. I applaud that effort, and Chax Press is
happy to join in. I also considered asking if people want to buy books for
such a purpose, and we'll send both the book AND the money received to
relief efforts. Then I thought it's probably easier if people just donate
money directly to relief efforts, and we'll just donate books. Our children
are finding out about giving things that children need. Diapers for babies,
food, clothes, school suppllies, etc., and we plan to follow up on that as
a family directly, and through people at one of our child's schools. As a
press, Chax can send multiple copies of some titles, or send individual
books on request, but I imagine that is best done at some point after
people are settled again. Thank you to all here for keeping up on the
reports. I'll hope to look here to find other ways I can help. Is anyone
coordinating any efforts in the way of transporting books and distributing
them?

Thanks,

Charles

Charles//ALL::

I visited the American Red Cross this afternoon and donated blood.
Seems like a happy alternative for those of us just scraping by as is.
Took less than an hour, and I'm sure, for many of us, Red Cross
locations are rather convenient to find.

San Francisco, September 1st, 2005

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
=20
=20
OTHER WORDS 4th San Francisco International Poetry Festival will draw poets
from ten different nations to a variety of local venues from October 13-16,
co-sponsored by the San Francisco offices of several international
consulates and cultural institutes, along with local literary arts
organizations. =20

The festival opens on Thursday, October 13th and runs through Sunday,
October 16th, 2005.

Taking place for the fourth time in six years, the OTHER WORDS San Francisc=
o
International Poetry Festival will this year bring together fifteen poets &
performing artists from a diversity of ten nations: Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Iraq, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.S.A.
The poets will read their own poetry in its original language (as is the
practice at international poetry festivals worldwide), with English-languag=
e
translations, the work of acclaimed translators, read by the poet or
translator. Newly appointed California State Poet Laureate Al Young will be
on hand to greet the visiting poets and read from his own poetry. ANIMA
MUNDI Dance Company presents choreography by Kathryn Roszak: =B3Enter Their
Dreaming; Windows into the Worlds of Emily Dickinson and Rainer Maria
Rilke,=B2 including poetry and letters of Emily Dickinson and Rilke.

J=F6rgensdotter (Sweden), Kai Nieminen (Finland), Eleni Stecopoulos, Chris
Stroffolino, and Al Young (USA).

=20

The OTHER WORDS festival offers a rare opportunity to step out of the
mono-lingual fixation of early 21st century life in the United States, to
experience some of the world=B9s extraordinary poetry in its original music,
and encounter the crucial act of translation. The actual fact of
multi-national diversity and other voices will be singularly present more
than ever in San Francisco over the four days of the festival. Poets in the
festival are internationally acclaimed and in several cases the poet will b=
e
reading their poetry in the US for the first time.  As a special
poly-lingual feature of this year=B9s festival, for the Saturday evening
LitCrawl reading (in conjunction with the LitQuake festival; see calendar
for time and location), eight international poets will read their poetry
exclusively in their native languages.

=20

Readings will take place at various public venues in San Francisco. A
program schedule can be found on the festival=B9s website www.other-words.com
<http://www.other-words.com> . In addition to presenting a series of group
readings, the festival will publish an anthology of the participating
writers.  Electronic photo files are available.

San Francisco State University, The Swedish Institute and the San Francisco
Art Institute.

Charles/All:

Donating blood nd money must be at the top
of the list, nd if you live in a relatively heavy
media market city, Red Cross can sure use
you on their telethons running nightly just about
everywhere now. (There's one in Rochester
tonight.)

When first I suggested helping some out with
with books, I was adding it as a specific gesture
to a specific audience-- and I certainly (I thought
it went without saying) meant everyone should
pile on with any and everything they can do,
especially since it's been abundantly clear from
the beginning of this event OUR Government
is NOT dong its all.

Good Wishes,
Gerld Schwartz

Dear Skip---

From Frank Sherlock on Brett and Janine....
I'm keeping my fingers crossed (or praying; whatever you want to call it...)

Chris-

I talked to Janine's mother today. Brett stayed in a cannery on the fourth
floor with his dogs & neighbor's pets. He called Monday after the storm, but
she lost contact. He called J's mother last night. He's still waiting to be
rescued, but the rescuers know he's there. They delivered some military
rations (food, water, etc.) but it may be a few more days until he's
rescued.

Peace,

Frank

 From the news coverage we are getting up here in Canada, it appears
that those who have been hardest hit are African American people and
the very poor, people who had no books to begin with and no place to
go. Watching this unfold, and lacking the means to intervene in a
meaningful way is very difficult and enraging. It's striking that the
best a country that spends millions of dollars a day bombing and
policing peoples on the other side of the globe can do for its own poor
and disenfranchised is to herd them into the bleachers of flimsy sports
arenas without water, food or relief from the heat. And when the number
of these desperate people begins to attain a certain mass, they are
turned away, as in Houston. I can only conclude that racism and class
contempt are at the root of this indifference.

Giving blood to the (white) Red Cross, or books to poets, or funds to
the so-called charitable organizations, most of which money never
reaches the real victims, won't do it. This is class war. Once the
rebellion is quelled, the carpet baggers will move in and grab the
prime real estate. Then you'll see real levees go up in record time.

Perhaps, while the rest of the country watches on CNN, the people on
the ground will get organized. Maybe some African-American political
and religious leaders will help organize the homeless people down there
to march on the white neighborhoods of Texas and sit down on their
front lawns, instead of lining up in front of sports stadiums. Maybe
people in New York  and Washington could mobilize to shut down their
cities until the situation in the South is resolved. No more business
as usual.

 From the point of view of people outside the US, you also have to
consider that these drastic weather changes are part of the global
warming and ecological breakdown for which the United States refuses to
assume its large share of responsibility. My heart and solidarity goes
out to the poor of Louisianna, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as to
the people of Iraq, who have only begun to pay the terrible price for
the greed and stupidity of the democratically elected government of the
United States.

Shame on the USA, shame on its people. How much longer before we
finally see an end to this Great American experiment? We can't afford
the cost.

I agree with most of what you've said, but think it a
bit strident to poo-poo most of the American people.
C'mon, now, you know that that's not exactly
intelligent. The American experiment, you say, which
is basically nondescript, has, if you do your
homework, done far more good than bad. Most of the
modern world and its institutions, all of which are
extending into such places as China and elsewhere, and
mostly to benefit, are byproducts of so-called
American experiment--those important bits now taken
for granted by most comfortable Westerners. I wonder
if the truth is that many people, in fact, really
don't care (to know), regardless of where they are
from (and whether they are smiling in response to the
grief of neglected folk who lost crappy schools and
and families or virginity, soon sanity, certainly
agency, and a city deserving of UNESCO world heritage
recognition (US idea never exploited)). Most of our
beds are equally dirty, if you look.

Sugar Hiccup
Applet 2 of The Deitel Mods

http://lewislacook.corporatepa.com/the_deitel_mods/content.php?page=sugarhiccup

The Deitel Mods is a series of variations on an applet
based on examples found in the book Java How to
Program (Prentice Hall, 1998) by H.M. and P.J. Deitel.
The book is an oft-used textbook for computer
programming students wishing to learn web programming
using the Open Source, cross-platform language Java.

Most of the mods are generative/reactive media
engines. Graphics are drawn live, sometimes as a
result of your input(moving the mouse, clicking the
mouse, etc.). The poem is assembled live as well, and
is sometimes influenced by your actions. The poem
accumulates with each applet, each applet adding a
line to the previous one. Each line of the poem is
randomly chosen from an accumulation of lines; each
applet adds another accumulation to accomodate the new
line.

Subject: Hurricane Katrina Dispatch

Dear Chris:

My family & I left New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. There
are only three computers available here at the business center of the
hotel where I am staying & people are waiting in line.

Because I have very limited access to internet services, I'm asking you
to please do me the favor of sending the following dispatch to any and
every source you know of that might be interested and responsive. Thank
you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Brenda Marie Osbey
Poet Laureate
State of Louisiana


To Whom It May Concern:

Those of us who did leave the City before the hurricane are scattered
and waiting to return to begin again. Reports of looting, shooting and
fires are distressing; but we hold on to faith that order will be
quickly restored. What is most important is that those housed at the LA.
Superdome not be forced to remain in what is clearly an untenable
situation. Medical attention and supplies, food, clothing and
transportation out of the City must be provided them. Repairs of levees
and pumps must begin now.

Many Americans know New Orleans primarily as a tourist destination, a
playground of tourists and wealthy businessmen. The fact is that this is
one of the greatest cities this country has known. It is unique in the
history of the nation and through such industries as oil & gas, shipping
and transportation and the growth and spread of jazz and the music
culture that has grown out of it, has provided the backbone for much of
what the rest of the world knows and thinks of as "American." Years ago
we were dubbed "the City that Care Forgot," " Big Easy," "Silver City"
not only because we knew how to enjoy life, because we were and are an
open-handed and open-hearted people. New Orleanians the world over
intend nothing less than the salvation of our City. Report that.

I, my Mother and my companion left New Orleans on Sunday afternoon,
traveled through Mississippi and Arkansas, and landed eventually in
Shreveport, LA. at the Isle of Capri Casino Hotel. My brother remained
in the City and still has land-line telephone service and water.
Presently, I am able to make but not receive calls on my cell phone. We
are safe and anxious to return to our City.

New Orleanians are a people of unimaginable strength and resilience and
New Orleans will be rebuilt as a great city. I am returning to begin
again as soon as possible. Report that. Tell that to the world again and
again.


Brenda Marie Osbey

Robert, You've expressed some of my sentiments exactly, and I am glad
someone has mentioned that poetry books are perhaps not the essential thing
at this moment. I understand the frustration of those outside the US (to the
extent that I can), but I must tell you it is extremely frustrating to be a
US citizen at this time in history and I think working together across
borders in any way possible is probably the best plan--rather than lodging
prejudicial comments against all US citizens, who are arguably about as
diverse as you can find on the planet. Cheers, Elizabeth

Yes, life-saving and reconstruction aid is the most
important thing at this moment (right now "boots" are
indeed more important than "Shakespeare", to use the
terms of a 19th century Russian riddle), and I suspect
a high percentage of the people on this list will be
contributing quite generously.  But there's no reason
to derogate in any way planning that's being done for
eventually also sending books.  We have to stop
beating ourselves up for our interest in the arts.

My book Home on the Range (The Night Sky with Stars in My Mouth), =
published
in June by O Books, is now available online from SPD (Small Press
Distribution).

*
(from the back cover:)

 All of the signature elements of Nathanson's poetry are visible: the
southwest, the Whitmanesque line, the cultural and intellectual history,
appropriation--A structure that one might think of as musical, beginning
with shorter movements, proceeding to longer ones, using each section to
identify, develop and sustain its own unique pitch . . . he has an ear =
that
is continually complicated by an overlay of mind. At that level, this =
poem
is one long elaboration of the senses, yet it's just as deeply embedded =
in
history. It's a complex production, yet is completely governed by desire =
and
its cognates.
--Ron Silliman

Nathanson's Home on the Range is an energetic, original and curious =
work,
roaming among poetry, fiction, and dream--a "travel" narrative =
traversing
many haunted semantic sites. Whitman-inspired in its scope and =
interactive
probing, yet also a work evoking losses, oddities, and orphanhood. The =
work
is a considerable achievement, with the power to startle and confront in
every way, from concept to detail.
--Rachel Blau DuPlessis

In Tenney Nathanson's epic poem, Home on the Range (The Night Sky with =
Stars
in My Mouth), Kafka goes to the mall, modernist alienation meets =
consumer
angst, "mile after mile of strip malls and car lots: home on the range." =
Its
108 stanzas offer a circuitous and often interrupted path, littered with
shards of western texts-from Whitman and Melville to Stein, Benjamin,
Mailer. But these encrypted writings are not mere commodities on display =
but
components in a talmudic interrogation of Zen Buddhist principles of =
empty
mind. As such, Home on the Range mirrors a new poetic and spiritual
cosmopolitanism--a "free working in differentiation"--as an alternative =
to
high noon dramas of the global marketplace.--Michael Davidson

Tenney Nathanson is one of the poets who in a transparent way are =
obsessed
by investigation and consciousness. His poetry is immense, and his =
awareness
of detail and the science of music never relents. He is perhaps a =
religious
poet of the 'religion of the surface of things.' His idea of the poem is =
of
a naturalizing epic that may exclude nothing. In this sense, his poetry =
is
always about the family and the possibilities of friendship and Eros in =
a
bleak time. But for him and his poetry, the time is always political, =
urban
and full of voices, like a Wang Wei Deer Park in the midst of New York =
City
and Arizona as universities and universal history rotated, torqued, and
exploded into a new garden. Nathanson comes from the tradition of =
experience
and Dewey, and his work is less about anything than it is a wilderness
experience, like the baggy novel full of fate: the long poem to wander. =
He
is one of my favorite poets, and he is impossibly and humorously serious =
and
refined. Don't call him difficult; it's all pleasure.--David Shapiro

This is very 'nice' but why only students from the New York Region?

I would imagine that most of those people have homes and resources if they
can afford to go to school 1400 miles away?
This seems like a strange bit of generiousity?

" Priority consideration will be given to those with pre-existing family

are you kidding?

i also am watching a lot of tv and reading a lot of net writing about
apocalypse n.o. from canada.

the poet margareta waterman, who lives in oregon, once told me something
like 'we hate it as much as you do, or more, this government, the way this
country is. the country isn't treating americans as badly as the people in
other countries where we wage unjust wars and shoot as many as possible, but
it's pretty bad here for people, you know, particularly if you don't have
much money. it's a police state ruled by the rich.'

in canada we have a deteriorating social welfare system, but it is
nonetheless a pathetically significant little more generous than what exists
in the usa for poor people, which is mostly didly squat. surely part of what
we are witnessing in apocalypse n.o. is the reality of that lack of support
the government of the usa extends to its own people. in a land of abundance.
it is so intensely militarist-capitalist that the people of new orleans are
starving in parking lots, off-ramps, and rotting corpses drift down the
flooded avenue. now they have the well-armed military marching in to help
them. that's got to be a mixed blessing when the money would have been
better spent on those levees before they busted, rather than iraq and guns,
the soldiers have shoot-to-kill orders, people have only the shirts on their
backs, and transportation out of the area is still slow.

racism is an issue, certainly, in both the usa and canada, but that those
levees didn't get fixed, even after the horrendous weather of 2004 down
there, and no real plans were in place to deal with this sort of
inevitability, that tells me the usa government is more comfortable with
disasters and wars than preventing them. neither the people of the usa nor
the rest of the world are served well by these cowboy capitalists.

like millions of others, i've been watching the tv and reading the net with
dismay and sadness for the people of the south. and that it was predicted so
widely and nothing was done about it in favour of more troops in iraq, which
never did have wmd--that has to be enraging a little bit like the stench of
rot, the new orleans heat, nowhere to go, and loved ones missing and
presumed drowned. it isn't the people of the united states we should
criticize but their inept and militaristic government. could canada elect a
government as bad as the bush administration? stephen harper and his
conservative cronies await that day impatiently.

Many New Orleans students also have the option of attending (as fully enrol=
led degree-seeking students) a number of Jesuit-associated schools around t=
he country... the University of San Francisco has already admitted about 18=
 such students as of today...=20

 I wanted to post some information concerning the wonderful poet Brett=20

and various people who had taken refuge there became increasingly desperate=

The building was surrounded by neck deep water. Brett was staying with his=

Dear List,

Several years ago, friends I had followed over the course
of serious travails and career moves and changes and
relationship decisions and bouts of family disharmony
and even cancer, old age, and death, suddenly decided,
independently of one another, ready for the next great
move, to cut ties they no longer cherished as active.
I am a double Taurus, Leo rising, which means I am loyal
to the way things are and have been and to improving
what needs improving, to try.  One friend, exiting, even blurted that
it was my always trying that had finally irritated her about me.

Imagine where I would be if I had moved to New Orleans --
which I could have done -- to "start over" (instead of loyally
insisting on moving to my hometown in MN).  I would be
sitting in the sports dome, not off with the other poets
in Lafayette.  My only friend in Layfayette is a photographer --
and not one of the cut-'er-off-'ers.  When I had first met her
in Houston, she spent ten days driving me to used car
dealerships, concerned that I not end up with a lemon.
She made the salesmen nervous when she climbed under
the cars after asking lots of questions -- she had been
an Air Force mechanic.  I heard that years ago that
she had had to go to a psych hospital for depression,
and I wasn't there, I was here, not hearing of it until later,
not knowing her address -- who was there?  That friend, Betty,is gold.

With prices on their way up, Americans do not want to
contemplate what it will cost to pull up New Orleans -- the gov't
did not want to fix its levees ahead of time, either.  I have visited
the city many times, and it's true, I think it's one of the rosiest
places I have ever been, with best food, strolling, and music.
I wish a talented batch of oysters could collect stories, vignettes,
write portraits -- better than the trite ones we get in the news --
not short stories or poems, but thumbprints of the real people
who are waiting for help in the city, so we could know who they are.

Hip Hop: Rapper (Kanye West) accuses Bush of racism


    "George Bush doesn't care about black people," West said from New
York during the show aired live on Friday ... He said America was set up
"to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as
possible"...We already realised a lot of the people that could help are
at war right now, fighting another way, and they've given them
permission to go down and shoot us,...I hate the way they portray us in
the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting. See a
white family, it says they're looking for food." .

Rapper accuses Bush of racism

Bush (L) has been accused of not caring about black people

Rapper Kanye West has surprised viewers of an NBC benefit concert for
Hurricane Katrina victims by accusing President George Bush of racism.

"George Bush doesn't care about black people," West said from New York
during the show aired live on Friday on the East Coast on NBC, MSNBC,
CNBC and Pax, just before cameras cut away to comedian Chris Tucker.

West, who is black, suggested moments earlier that delays in providing
relief to survivors of the hurricane that hit the US Gulf Coast on
Monday and flooded New Orleans were deliberate.

He said America was set up "to help the poor, the black people, the less
well-off as slow as possible".

"We already realised a lot of the people that could help are at war
right now, fighting another way, and they've given them permission to go
down and shoot us," the Grammy award-winning singer, who was paired with
comedian Mike Myers, also said in what NBC described as unscripted remarks.

The rapper was apparently referring to shoot-on-sight orders issued to
National Guard troops to halt violence and looting in New Orleans.

Media attacked

West also criticised the media's portrayal of blacks, saying: "I hate
the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says
they're looting. See a white family, it says they're looking for food."

The hurricane left widespread
devastation and caused havoc
In a statement, NBC said: "Kanye West departed from the scripted
comments that were prepared for him, and his opinions in no way
represent the views of the networks.

"It would be most unfortunate if the efforts of the artists who
participated tonight and the generosity of millions of Americans who are
helping those in need are overshadowed by one person's opinion."

The programme, hosted by Matt Lauer of NBC News, urged viewers to donate
to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.

It included 18 presenters, and featured performances by New Orleans
natives Harry Connick Jr and Wynton Marsalis, as well as Louisiana
native Tim McGraw and Faith Hill of Mississippi, which was also struck
by Katrina.

No I definitely didn't mean to denigrate anyone's generosity of any sort.


The enormity of the situation is hard  to take in.

Yes, life-saving and reconstruction aid is the most
important thing at this moment (right now "boots" are
indeed more important than "Shakespeare", to use the
terms of a 19th century Russian riddle), and I suspect
a high percentage of the people on this list will be
contributing quite generously.  But there's no reason
to derogate in any way planning that's being done for
eventually also sending books.  We have to stop
beating ourselves up for our interest in the arts.

Rutgers has established an open-door, no-restrictions, admit policy
for immediate enrollment of any New Orleans students; 45 so far have
come, and several faculty members from Tulane have temporarily moved
their labs to Rutgers.

Anyone may join me in praying either for present-government overthrow
once people are housed and fed decently, or else sudden, miraculous
rehabilitation of Bush II and his political appointees,
immediately.  All of this is beyond words.

Subject:      important piece from Thulani Davis on New Orleans,
              Hurricane and you know who
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I've been talking often to some of you and when I woke up today, the only
thought that came to mind was Jesse Jackson's indignant cry, "This is the
bottom of the slave ship we are looking at."

I think Jesse actually put his finger on the what happened to all of us this
week.
Those shots we've seen are, as he said, the bottom of the slave ships.  I
think
that really goes to why all the rest of us watching are so traumatized.  and
I
think it is necessary to repeat what he has said about how the people in
this
country have a high tolerance for viewing "black pain."  Yes, while we are
asking the unheard question as to why a third of New Orleans' population
is so poor and all black, everyone from the president on down is comfortable
with these realities of our ongoing unemployment, overcrowding,
homelessness,
drug addiction, neighborhood crime and despair.

Jesse's metaphor is also so apt in that you only have to listen to five
minutes of
reporting to know families have been separated in ways that could be
irreparable--
across states, even mother's from month-old babies...just evacuating babies
without contact
with the parents is such a nightmare, I hate even hearing about it.  These
are the people
who were marginalized from the Internet as well; are they going to run to a
computer site?
AFrican Americans in this crisis are further having the devastating
experience of watching parents
suffer and die right in their faces on sidewalks where people have been
forced to stand, not even sit for days.
And the people crowded next to them are experiencing the same deaths.
And like our ancestors, the poor today will have no access to therapeutic
treatment.
This is where you just have to agree with Jesse that the people in charge
have the capacity
to tolerate scenes of suffering they know have been suffered by blacks for
generations.

At the same time, people among the stranded have been made aware that they
are being portrayed as lawless by
media people who are freaking out at the idea of thousands of black people
not guarded by police.
That in itself is a legacy of slavery. And even as we watched, the reporters
and anchors on both NBC and
CNN yesterday both misidentified Congressman John Lewis as Congressman
Elijah Cummings for
HOURS.  This is one of the staples of the era when I was young and black
people first appeared on TV
and no one could tell one of us from another.  This is really tired, old
nonsense.  I find myself filing email
complaints to the networks, even though I know John Lewis and many others
probably told them.

Lastly, there is now what is called the Katrina Diaspora.  This diaspora of
people without resources
puts the restoration of families and community at risk, and in the case of
New Orleans' black community,
probably makes that impossible. Even people who own land there are going to
be in deep trouble
trying to hold onto it when the real estate boondoggle gets in the courts.
I'm afraid we'll be reading a lot of
stupid crap about how they couldn't be found, taxes were owed, etc. as in
times past throughout the
South. That's why I hope Jesse gets someone to bring people like Congressman
Bennie Thompson into the fold,
as he is familiar with the commission that had to be set up in the Delta
because people are still trying to get
back land stolen in the 1930s. And the developers are probably asking for
eminent domain to be declared even
as I'm typing.

Will Jesse, Al, Elijah, et. al. be asking after the fact, after they've read
it in the paper that the black community
be represented at the table of planning "the NEW New Orleans?"  The cultural
heritage of New Orleans, which is so unique
is in serious jeopardy.  The perfect mix of forces and cultures was based in
a particularly unique feature of the dispersion
of Africans during slavery:  a disproportionate share of the Yoruba brought
here (who were a minority within the
groups in Middle Passage) landed in that area. What happened after that in
encounters with the French, the Caribbean
and the peoples of the States, cannot be replicated.  Replacing the
architecture with vinyl versions of shotgun and camel
back houses will not produce any Buddy Boldens, Jelly Roll Mortons or Louis
Armstrongs. And as a writer, I myself have
used the invaluable records kept there of this unique heritage.  Just as one
had to worry in the several rounds of the bombing
of Baghdad that not only were untold people being killed but some of the
oldest treasures of human life, I feel even more
concerned that no one will care that thousands have died in New Orleans,
others thousands dislocated and that one of our own cultural treasures, the
city of New Orleans itself, will be deprived of its cultural engine.

This is a tragedy not only for the millions there on the ground, and the
national economy  but for the culture at large.
We are witnessing in one week a dislocation one-fifth the size of Middle
Passage--which took place over more
than 200 years. And all those conveniences of modern social organization
which would mitigate its effects for
most of us--phone, internet, cars, gasoline, and family with ample
housing--do not apply to this country's poor.
For them, getting lost may mean not being found any more easily than in 1865
when people went on foot and
in wagons following word of mouth leads to find where family members may
have been sent.

It is unbearable, and unconscionable.

*5 THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP IMMEDIATELY*
1. Duplicate what we are doing elsewhere in New York City, in your city
or town, on your college campus, at your church, synagogue, mosque, or
other religious institution, via your fraternity or sorority, or via
your local civic or social organization.

2. Cut and paste the information in this eblast about:

- Items needed by survivors of the New Orleans catastrophe
- Monetary donations
- Where you can ship non perishable items
- Alternative media outlets
- Five things you can do to help immediately

...and share this information as a ONE SHEET with folks near and far,
via email, or as a hand out at your event, religious institution, and
with your civic or social organization.

3. Voice your opinion to local and national media, and to elected
officials, via letter, email, op ed article, or phonecall, regarding the
coverage of the New Orleans catastrophe, as well as to the federal
government's on going handling of the situation.

4. Ask the hotel you frequent, such as the Marriott or Holiday Inn, to
give your hotel points to an individual or family in need of a stay for
a night, a few nights, or longer, depending on how many points you have.
Be sure to get confirmation that your points have been applied in that
way. Encourage others to do the same. Also inquire if your airline
frequent flyer mileage can be used for hotel stays as well. Finally,
either offer to pay for hotel rooms, or encourage others to do so,
including your place of employment or worship or your organization.

5. Dare to care about other human beings, no matter their race, gender,
class, sexual orientation, religion, geography, culture, clothing,
hairstyle, or accent or language. Like September 11th, the New Orleans
catastrophe is a harsh reminder that all life is precious, as is each
day we have on this earth.

AND REMEMBER that our attention and response to the New Orleans
catastrophe needs to happen in three stages...DISASTER, RECOVERY, and
REBUILDING. We need you for all three stages.

laura asks me to send on this message - more confirmation of the

The extent of the catastrophe--and the lack of aid,
the slowness & smallness of the response--is
unimaginable. Friends have been bicycling medical
supplies form the local drugstores to the refugee
shelters! New Orleans is a war zone in a disaster
area...and Bush is anxious to save money for Iraq. At
every contact you have w/ people please try to make
them understand the extent of the betrayal--and ask
them to donate to the Red Cross, please. This is bad
beyond belief.... I was on the plane w/ two smug
Californians who were saying things like "People make
their own situations!" And even "Some people WANT to
be poor!" To my credit I didn't kill them--I must be
mellowing. They were headed to Houston, for vacations
(I can hope refugees hurt them). When they knew where
I was going they never even said "I'm sorry," or "be
safe" or...but maybe being in the South has raised my
expectations: no Southerner would act so utterly
heartless. Please write to your representatives, call
the White House, push for recognition and relief. I
hope this brings Bush down--but people are dying every
day here & change is a distant hope. Start now making
sure that you & everyone you know expresses their
dismay and disbelief--and say that this will be
remembered for a long, long time!

uh . . . given the circumstances I'll forgive Laura's geographic insensitivity
here -- Of course those Californians weren't being smug by virtue of being
Californians, remarks this part-time Californian -- and a lot of us (by which
at this moment I mean Californians) are already making donations and trying to
do what we can before we get hit by the next earthquake/mudslide/wild fire --

and as for "No southerner would act so utterly heartless" . . . well, some of us
have met any number of heartless, indeed murderous southerners over our life
spans -- my life was very nearly ended one night in North Carolina by some
people who didn't take well to interracial groups --

so let's please put that sort of thing away and concentrate on trying to help
and on underscoring the main point that Laura makes -- this is a disaster made
murderous by American politics -- there really should be hell to pay for Bush &
Company's handling of this --

NEW AMERICAN WRITING / 369 Molino Avenue / Mill Valley, CA 94941

Dear Friend of New American Writing:

Because we are currently receiving less than $1 per issue of the
magazine’s “sell-through” at Barnes & Noble and Borders, which unfortunately
dominate the bookstore trade and use a heavy hand with small providers such as
literary magazines, it’s urgent that we reduce our reliance on income from
those chains and thus also our distributor, Ingram Periodicals.  If we are not
able to do so, we will be forced financially to cease publication of a magazine
that has existed since 1971.

Therefore, we ask you to order the magazine directly from us using the
following methods:

(1) 	Purchasing a three-issue subscription for $27, a savings of $1 per
annual issue.  To do so, send a check to the address above.  If you wish to use
a credit card, order through our website:
http://www.newamericanwriting.com.

(2)	Purchasing individual issues as they appear from the same address, by
check or by credit card through our website.

The current issue, No. 23, was published in June.  It contains new poems by
Mahmoud Darwish; The Black Heralds of César Vallejo, translated by Clayton
Eshleman; a selection of contemporary Vietnamese poetry translated by Nguyen Do
and Paul Hoover; edited by Todd Swift, the work of twenty younger Canadian
poets including Christian Bök and Lisa Robertson; and poetry by Donald Revell,
George Albon, Elizabeth Robinson, Andrew Joron, Clayton Eshleman, Stacy Doris,
Laynie Browne, Linh Dinh, Joseph Lease, Anna Rabinowitz, Timothy Liu, Sally
Keith, and Aaron Shurin, among many other outstanding U.S. poets.

Over the years, we have published more than 2,000 poets including many of you
receiving this letter.  We are proud of our record of introducing exciting new
poets and poetries.

If we can add 400 new subscribers, we can insure the longevity of the magazine
the next three years.  Please join us as a subscriber and forward this message
to your friends.

Sincerely, Maxine Chernoff and Paul Hoover

I wrote to tell him to clean things up and then fire everyone including
himself.  I got this response.  Let's just call it f-cking inadequate.


On behalf of President Bush, thank you for your correspondence.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, President Bush and all
Americans send their thoughts and prayers to the families of
those who have lost lives and to all those affected by this
natural disaster.

The President is directing Federal agencies throughout the
government to do all in their power to assist the victims of
Hurricane Katrina. The top priority is to save and sustain lives.
President Bush established a White House task force to oversee
Hurricane Katrina response and recovery, and he convened a Cabinet
meeting to ensure that Federal agencies' efforts are timely and
fully coordinated.  Residents of the Gulf Coast states affected by
the hurricane have lost loved ones, lost homes, and been displaced
from their communities, and they will have the full support of the
Federal government.

The President has called for the coordination of all parties
involved in the response and relief efforts. Federal, state, and
local governments are working side-by-side to deliver relief to
the areas physically damaged by Hurricane Katrina and to
communities across the South that will be affected in the aftermath
of the storm. Efforts and resources are focused on saving lives,
sustaining lives, and supporting long-term recovery.  For
information and guidance you may wish to visit the FEMA website at
www.fema.gov or call 800-621-3362 or 800-621-FEMA.

The President has called on all Americans to support the relief and
rescue efforts through charitable contributions and aid. Americans
who wish to contribute can do so by contacting charities that are
assisting with hurricane relief.  For more information on relief
and recovery efforts, please visit the USAFreedom Corps website at
www.usafreedomcorps.gov.

Thank you again for taking the time to write.

The remark you make first-off perfectly represents the
exact same smugness Laura Mullen attributed to TWO
specific people who happened to be from California.
She didn't say ALL Californians, but you, perhaps are
too blinded by smog or your own apparently smug
attitude to read very clearly. "I'll forgive Laura's
geographic insensitivity"--please! Who the hell do you
think you are?!

Hurricane Kanye Hits America: The Funky Freestyle Heard Around the World

After yawning my way through an early morning rant about the failure of Black leadership, the hostile take over of Hip Hop by the mega corporations and the conspiracy to put dummy juice in the Kool Aid in the 'hood before going back to grab another hour of sleep before I have to officially get up and face the world. But a funny thing happened on my way between BET and CNN. There was a news flash that sometime during the night Hurricane Kanye had hit America....

Hurricane Kanye Hits America:The Funky Freestyle Heard Around the World

 Min. Paul Scott


 Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm. Look for me all around you. For with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me countless millions of Black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for Liberty, Freedom and Life.
 --The Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey

 As I woke up early this morning, I went through my usual Saturday morning ritual, a quick trip to the fridge to get some juice then a quick flip through the channels to see if Gil Scott Heron was wrong and the revolution was really televised or if Chuck D's threat to hijack the airwaves had finally come to fruition. It's always the same story, same stuff different day. After yawning my way through an early morning rant about the failure of Black leadership, the hostile take over of Hip Hop by the mega corporations and the conspiracy to put dummy juice in the Kool Aid in the 'hood before going back to grab another hour of sleep before I have to officially get up and face the world. But a funny thing happened on my way between BET and CNN. There was a news flash that sometime during the night Hurricane Kanye had hit America....

 I recognized that look. I had seen it before, not recently but before. I saw it in the eyes of the Brothers at the 1968 Olympics when they threw up the Black Power Fist before the world. I saw it in the eyes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr before he made his speech against the Vietnam War. I saw the same nervous look of self sacrifice and defiance the eyes of Kanye West when he stood before the world and said that the way that America treats poor Black folks is wack!

 I can imagine the shock of the folks in the control room at NBC when Kanye flipped the script on them and went into a funky freestyle about the way that the media portray Black folks and that G Dub and the rest of them really don't care about us.

 "Bill! We have an emergency! He was supposed to just throw up the diamond and say "Rockafella ya'll" and leave. Hit the switch!!!!"

 The bias of the media became evident when the white lady reporter prefaced the story by reminding the audience that Kanye was the same guy who hosted a party last week were Suge Knight was shot and how she hoped that the statement did not cause a drop in donations. I noticed the Brotha next to her shoot her a look like, "Don't make me pimp slap you up in here!"

 The media coverage reminded me of the first time that Hip Hop was attacked. Contrary to popular belief, the first campaign against Hip Hop was not against lyrics that threatened to bust a cap in another Brotha or disrespected Sista's but PE, Griff, Souljah and them were attacked for doing what Kanye did, not sticking to the script.

 Historically, it has been an act of revolutionary career suicide for Black athletes and entertainers to speak out on the behalf of Black people. From the Civil Rights Era to the Hip Hop Era it has been taboo for them to deviate from the usual "It ain't about race/we are all Americans/let's all pull together/ script that they are given to read after something ticks Black folks off and the natives start to get a little restless. It has been a rare occurrence, in deed, when one of them breaks the mold and speaks from the heart. The reason is that Black folks are fickle and a month after MC Supreme Truth provokes the wrath of white America, he is quickly forgotten by most of us. While most of us go back to business as usual , MC TRUTH goes from a platnum Hip Hop artist with a mansion and a Bentley to Tyrone Johnson, clerk # 5 at Save-a Lot Convenience store.

 Kanye told the TRUTH and it needed to be said. Anytime white conservative talk show hosts like Neal Boortz (http://boortz.com We need to start an email and phone campaign to holla at him this Tuesday, for real) can get on the radio and make racist statements against Black people who are suffering from a natural disaster and urge the good ole boys to arm themselves and shoot first and ask questions later, somebody has to say something! We all know that "martial law" is a code word for white folks to shoot Brotha's on sight.

 We must support Brothers and Sisters who stand up for the people like Kanye West. As the right wing gather their forces to attack this Brother, we must attack back! Everytime one of them disses Kanye on the radio, TV or newspaper we must make an immediate organized response. We must show them the real meaning of "Bring tha Noise!"

 Maybe there was more to Kanye's song "Jesus Walks" then we thought. Maybe it was about more than the same ole Eurocentric theology warmed over and put to a Hip Hop beat. Maybe it was touching on a deeper Revolutionary message of Yeshua, the Black Revolutionary Messiah. Someone who was willing to sacrifice his life to bring TRUTH to the people.

 A few years ago white folks were walking around asking, "What would Jesus do." He would have done just what you did Kanye..just what you did....

Tod,
You might want to reread laura's message.  It may just be you owe Aldon =
an apology. =20

 Laura's writing let's her personal prejudices show through; after all, =
she did say, "...no Southerner would act so utterly heartless..."  =
Speaking of her California passengers and their failure to act with the =
southern charm she implies is a quality of all southerners.  I can't =
help but wonder if she includes Newt Gingrich in that crowd of =
southerners?  Or my favorite southern charm lad, the former senate =
leader, Trent Lott, or for that matter, Trent's replacement, senator =
Frist...all are truly capital examples of southern charm.  Are these the =
chaps Laura intends to invoke?  I hope not.  But these are Southerners, =
so we must conclude Laura includes them in her sweeping generalization.  =
   =20

Was Laura specifically categorizing all Californian's as being cut from =
the cloth of those two with whom she had the encounter?  Not directly, =
to be sure; indirectly and by inference, specifically followed by her =
claims of the gentility of her southerners, however, I have to say she =
was painting all with the same brush...intentionally or not. =20

I disliked Laura's comments and found them unnecessarily biased; I spent =
ten years as a Californian in San Jose, then ten years as a Southerner =
living near Atlanta...I assure you and Laura, not all Californians are =
heartless, and a hell of a lot of Southerners are...at least many I knew =
were. =20

Perhaps Nudel is right, ...emotions are ruling the day since the storm =
and "... maybe we should take the gun out of every one's =
hands....drn..." =20

Thanks for the advice, Harry. =20

Yes, fratricidal wars are horrible, even if watched from a distance.
Or better, they are looked for by violent people.

 President George W. Bush, snipped without edit from a White House press release:

    "We've got a lot of rebuilding to do. First, we're going to save lives and stabilize the situation. And then we're going to help these communities rebuild.

    The good news is -- and it's hard for some to see it now -- that out of this chaos is going to come a fantastic Gulf Coast, like it was before.

    Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house -- he's lost his entire house -- there's going to be a fantastic house. And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch. (Laughter.)"

headline on today's WASHINGTON POST:

WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS BLAME


that really says it all, now, doesn't it . . .


but to respond quickly to several responses --

who the hell do I think I am?  I think I'm somebody born in the midwest, who
grew up in the south, spent a decade living full time in California and now
commuting between there and Pennsylvania,,,, who has learned that smugness and
heartlessness and murdeourness murderousness (twice !) murderosity, merde, know
no geographical boundaries --

I do try to read closely-- I didn't ask anybody for an apology -- the phrase I
wrote does begin by saying that of course the smug Californians on the plane
were not smug by virute of being Californian, thus showing that I did in fact
take Laura's meaning -- but the subsequent line about how "no southerner" would
be so heartless does undercut the thrust of that earlier qualification, now
don't it?

and the point is, after all:

WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS BLAME

on which point I believe Laura and I, though perhaps not Nudel, agree --

and as for geographical insensitivity, who could top the speaker of the house,
that smug guy from my natal midwest, who I was amused to see spend a whole day
explaining himself after remarking that perhaps New Orleans wasn't worth
rebuilding --

?

Notes =46rom Inside New Orleans

by Jordan Flaherty

Friday, September 2, 2005

I just left New Orleans a couple hours ago.=A0 I traveled from the=20
apartment I was staying in by boat to a helicopter to a refugee camp.=A0=20=

If anyone wants to examine the attitude of federal and state officials=20=

towards the victims of hurricane Katrina, I advise you to visit one of=20=

the refugee camps.

In the refugee camp I just left, on the I-10 freeway near Causeway,=20
thousands of people (at least 90% black and poor) stood and squatted in=20=

mud and trash behind metal barricades, under an unforgiving sun, with=20
heavily armed soldiers standing guard over them.=A0 When a bus would =
come=20
through, it would stop at a random spot, state police would open a gap=20=

in one of the barricades, and people would rush for the bus, with no=20
information given about where the bus was going. Once inside (we were=20
told) evacuees would be told where the bus was taking them - Baton=20
Rouge, Houston, Arkansas, Dallas, or other locations.=A0 I was told that=20=

if you boarded a bus bound for Arkansas (for example), even people with=20=

family and a place to stay in Baton Rouge would not be allowed to get=20
out of the bus as it passed through Baton Rouge.=A0 You had no choice =
but=20
to go to the shelter in Arkansas.=A0 If you had people willing to come =
to=20
New Orleans to pick you up, they could not come within 17 miles of the=20=

camp.

I traveled throughout the camp and spoke to Red Cross workers,=20
Salvation Army workers, National Guard, and state police, and although=20=

they were friendly, no one could give me any details on when buses=20
would arrive, how many, where they would go to, or any other=20
information.=A0 I spoke to the several teams of journalists nearby, and=20=

asked if any of them had been able to get any information from any=20
federal or state officials on any of these questions, and all of them,=20=

from Australian tv to local Fox affiliates complained of an=20
unorganized, non-communicative, mess.=A0 One cameraman told me "as=20
someone who's been here in this camp for two days, the only information=20=

I can give you is this: get out by nightfall.=A0 You don't want to be=20
here at night."

There was also no visible attempt by any of those running the camp to=20
set up any sort of transparent and consistent system, for instance a=20
line to get on buses, a way to register contact information or find=20
family members, special needs services for children and infirm, phone=20
services, treatment for possible disease exposure, nor even a single=20
trash can.

To understand the dimensions of this tragedy, its important to look at=20=

New Orleans itself.

For those who have not lived in New Orleans, you have missed a=20
incredible, glorious, vital, city.=A0 A place with a culture and energy=20=

unlike anywhere else in the world.=A0 A 70% African-American city where=20=

resistance to white supremacy has supported a generous, subversive and=20=

unique culture of vivid beauty.=A0 =46rom jazz, blues and hiphop, to=20
secondlines, Mardi Gras Indians, Parades, Beads, Jazz Funerals, and red=20=

beans and rice on Monday nights, New Orleans is a place of art and=20
music and dance and sexuality and liberation unlike anywhere else in=20
the world.

It is a city of kindness and hospitality, where walking down the block=20=

can take two hours because you stop and talk to someone on every porch,=20=

and where a community pulls together when someone is in need.=A0 It is a=20=

city of extended families and social networks filling the gaps left by=20=

city, state and federal governments that have abdicated their=20
responsibility for the public welfare. It is a city where someone you=20
walk past on the street not only asks how you are, they wait for an=20
answer.

It is also a city of exploitation and segregation and fear.=A0 The city=20=

of New Orleans has a population of just over 500,000 and was expecting=20=

300 murders this year, most of them centered on just a few,=20
overwhelmingly black, neighborhoods.=A0 Police have been quoted as =
saying=20
that they don't need to search out the perpetrators, because usually a=20=

few days after a shooting, the attacker is shot in revenge.

There is an atmosphere of intense hostility and distrust between much=20
of Black New Orleans and the N.O. Police Department.=A0 In recent =
months,=20
officers have been accused of everything from drug running to=20
corruption to theft.=A0 In separate incidents, two New Orleans police=20
officers were recently charged with rape (while in uniform), and there=20=

have been several high profile police killings of unarmed youth,=20
including the murder of Jenard Thomas, which has inspired ongoing=20
weekly protests for several months.

The city has a 40% illiteracy rate, and over 50% of black ninth graders=20=

will not graduate in four years. Louisiana spends on average $4,724 per=20=

child's education and ranks 48th in the country for lowest teacher=20
salaries. The equivalent of more than two classrooms of young people=20
drop out of Louisiana schools every day and about 50,000 students are=20
absent from school on any given day.=A0 Far too many young black men =
from=20
New Orleans end up enslaved in Angola Prison, a former slave plantation=20=

where inmates still do manual farm labor, and over 90% of inmates=20
eventually die in the prison.=A0 It is a city where industry has left,=20=

and most remaining jobs are are low-paying, transient, insecure jobs in=20=

the service economy.

Race has always been the undercurrent of Louisiana politics.=A0 This=20
disaster is one that was constructed out of racism, neglect and=20
incompetence.=A0 Hurricane Katrina was the inevitable spark igniting the=20=

gasoline of cruelty and corruption.=A0 =46rom the neighborhoods left =
most=20
at risk, to the treatment of the refugees to the the media portrayal of=20=

the victims, this disaster is shaped by race.

Louisiana politics is famously corrupt, but with the tragedies of this=20=

week our political leaders have defined a new level of incompetence.=A0=20=

As hurricane Katrina approached, our Governor urged us to "Pray the=20
hurricane down" to a level two.=A0 Trapped in a building two days after=20=

the hurricane, we tuned our battery-operated radio into local radio and=20=

tv stations, hoping for vital news, and were told that our governor had=20=

called for a day of prayer.=A0 As rumors and panic began to rule, they=20=

was no source of solid dependable information.=A0 Tuesday night,=20
politicians and reporters said the water level would rise another 12=20
feet - instead it stabilized.=A0 Rumors spread like wildfire, and the=20
politicians and media only made it worse.

While the rich escaped New Orleans, those with nowhere to go and no way=20=

to get there were left behind.=A0 Adding salt to the wound, the local =
and=20
national media have spent the last week demonizing those left behind.=A0=20=

As someone that loves New Orleans and the people in it, this is the=20
part of this tragedy that hurts me the most, and it hurts me deeply.

No sane person should classify someone who takes food from indefinitely=20=

closed stores in a desperate, starving city as a "looter," but that's=20
just what the media did over and over again.=A0 Sheriffs and politicians=20=

talked of having troops protect stores instead of perform rescue=20
operations.

Images of New Orleans' hurricane-ravaged population were transformed=20
into black, out-of-control, criminals.=A0 As if taking a stereo from a=20=

store that will clearly be insured against loss is a greater crime than=20=

the governmental neglect and incompetence that did billions of dollars=20=

of damage and destroyed a city.=A0 This media focus is a tactic, just as=20=

the eighties focus on "welfare queens" and "super-predators" obscured=20
the simultaneous and much larger crimes of the Savings and Loan scams=20
and mass layoffs, the hyper-exploited people of New Orleans are being=20
used as a scapegoat to cover up much larger crimes.

City, state and national politicians are the real criminals here.=A0=20
Since at least the mid-1800s, its been widely known the danger faced by=20=

flooding to New Orleans.=A0 The flood of 1927, which, like this week's=20=

events, was more about politics and racism than any kind of natural=20
disaster, illustrated exactly the danger faced.=A0 Yet government=20
officials have consistently refused to spend the money to protect this=20=

poor, overwhelmingly black, city.=A0 While FEMA and others warned of the=20=

urgent impending danger to New Orleans and put forward proposals for=20
funding to reinforce and protect the city, the Bush administration, in=20=

every year since 2001, has cut or refused to fund New Orleans flood=20
control, and ignored scientists warnings of increased hurricanes as a=20
result of global warming.=A0 And, as the dangers rose with the=20
floodlines, the lack of coordinated response dramatized vividly the=20
callous disregard of our elected leaders.

The aftermath from the 1927 flood helped shape the elections of both a=20=

US President and a Governor, and ushered in the southern populist=20
politics of Huey Long.

In the coming months, billions of dollars will likely flood into New=20
Orleans.=A0 This money can either be spent to usher in a "New Deal" for=20=

the city, with public investment, creation of stable union jobs, new=20
schools, cultural programs and housing restoration, or the city can be=20=

"rebuilt and revitalized" to a shell of its former self, with newer=20
hotels, more casinos, and with chain stores and theme parks replacing=20
the former neighborhoods, cultural centers and corner jazz clubs.

Long before Katrina, New Orleans was hit by a hurricane of poverty,=20
racism, disinvestment, deindustrialization and corruption.=A0 Simply the=20=

damage from this pre-Katrina hurricane will take billions to repair.

Now that the money is flowing in, and the world's eyes are focused on=20
Katrina, its vital that progressive-minded people take this opportunity=20=

to fight for a rebuilding with justice.=A0 New Orleans is a special=20
place, and we need to fight for its rebirth.

does anyone know of the whereabouts and/or safety of poet Mona Lisa

Just a quick note to those of you who live in/near Chicago-you must go see
Geraldine Kim at Myopic Books tonight (http://www.myopicbookstore.com
<http://www.myopicbookstore.com/> ).  She read Thursday night in my series
in St. Louis (http://belz.net/readings) and it was one of the best readings
I have been to in any venue.  Her book, Povel, is like a multiheaded verbal
beast, very clearly designed and relevant. It won the Fence 2005 Modern
Poets Series, but there's still not enough buzz about this amazing 22 year
old, Geraldine Kim.  I'm going to review it soon, but the reading is
TONIGHT, so just go see it and let me know what you think.



Aaron

Someone emailed, "What's so great about Geraldine Kim? I certainly trust
your judgment."



I replied:  "G Kim is very aggressive in her ironies. She reminds of me
Swift, but in a more fractured, glittering, poetic way. She allows herself
to write about everything and somehow tames it all. A mental behemoth, she
is, I think. I love her. She sold 14 copies of her book to my crowd of 30+,
which should tell you something."

Rutgers has established an open-door, no-restrictions, admit policy

Anyone may join me in praying either for present-government overthrow

Laura Mullen I'm sure knows as well as everyone else on this list that not all Southerners are paragons of virtue. Every statement has a context and hers was made as a person in Louisiana, immediately adjacent to the hell that was a beautiful, incredible place to live. I, as someone who only left New Orleans last August for grad school, after living there several years and most certainly a lifetime, am appalled at how completely "uh..." PETTY and insipid you are to bother to "critique" a completely harmless generalization as "no Southerners could possibly be so heartless," that was OBVIOUSLY written in the thick of an emotional moment. And yet you reassert it?? Some of us are in pain. Some of us are heartbroken. Some of us are pissed as hell. Who gives a shit whether someone claims--esp. in the context that this statement was uttered--that Southerners could never be so heartless?! Get a clue. I'm not wasting any more energy on this!

grew up in the south, spent a decade living full time in California and now
commuting between there and Pennsylvania,,,, who has learned that smugness and
heartlessness and murdeourness murderousness (twice !) murderosity, merde, know

I do try to read closely-- I didn't ask anybody for an apology -- the phrase I
wrote does begin by saying that of course the smug Californians on the plane
were not smug by virute of being Californian, thus showing that I did in fact
take Laura's meaning -- but the subsequent line about how "no southerner" would
be so heartless does undercut the thrust of that earlier qualification, now
don't it?

and the point is, after all:

WHITE HOUSE SHIFTS BLAME

on which point I believe Laura and I, though perhaps not Nudel, agree --

and as for geographical insensitivity, who could top the speaker of the house,

And Uthana said tonight that Daniel, who's still in the Bywater, said that Dr. Bob, who puts up the Be Nice or Leave signs everywhere, was beaten by the military for trying to acquire food for survival, as no supplies have made it into the Bywater, or at least the part where our friend Daniel is holed up with whatever supplies he has left and an AK-47. The military are actually SHOOTING at anyone caught "stealing" food. Why the hell wouldn't they just let people take whatever supplies they need?! Why are these people not patroling only for violence apart from rescue? Not to mention the recovery of the thousands--thousands of bodies that can't even begin to be recovered yet? This is as horrific as 9/11, when the gov't response was as traumatic for me as the event. Daniel reportedly has found a way out and is leaving tomorow.

Here's a forwarded post from Andrea (I can't even remember if I forwarded this to the list already or not). She and Jeffrey have acquired a donated vehicle and are heading back to New Orleans with supplies--if they get in. God forbid someone bring life-saving supplies to the dying (that might be as bad as accepting aid from "furin" countries, and we're jess two dam prowd t'do that!).

Subject: Re: are you okay?

   Hi Monica,

I'm OK.  I escaped on Wednesday and am in Baton Rouge.  Yes, the cell
phone towers were all knocked out by the hurricane.  The hurricane
itself, though, caused only about 20% of the horror.  The government is
not letting people in to bring supplies.  They are not bringing
supplies.  The hospitals and even the convention center where people
are gathering are full of corpses- people who have died of dehydration
when there are people with truckloads of water in Baton Rouge, ready
and willing to deliver them, but the National Guard won't let them in
to New Orleans.

It's so good to hear from you.  I'm pasting the story of how I got out
below.  Please do forward this around and tell everyone what is really
going on in New Orleans so they can urge the government to LET PEOPLE
IN so they can help their friends and families.  That is the only thing
we can do right now.

-Claudia

Wednesday:

They have shut off the tap water.  They want to stem disease from
drinking contaminated water, but at least if they gave us contaminated
water, we could boil it.  I feel panic welling up- why didn't I fill up
more jugs when we had tap water? Since the water has been on a few
days, we have grown complacent.  We have been taking showers, so the
bathtub is empty.  I feel so stupid.

Also, we sense that the situation in the streets has deteriorated.
Fewer and fewer of our bohemian friends, and people in general, are
left.  Sinister young men walk down these mostly deserted streets.
There is an ominous sense of abandonment.

We decide we must get out, and try to contact everyone we know who owns
a car, by telephone and walking.  No one with a car is left in the
city. We decide at least to relocate to Jimmy's apartment, which is
more secure.   We then see our new friends/neighbors, Niko, Melissa,
and Rarig.  They propose bicycling out of the city to Baton Rouge.  It
seems a ludicrous idea at first, but on second thought, sounds
feasible.  The distance is 80 miles, and if we bring a very large
amount of water, we could leave early in the morning and arrive in
Baton Rouge by nightfall.  We plan to meet at Molly's at 7am the next
morning to depart, a bicycle tribe.

Back at Jimmy's, we tell him of our intentions, and he says he has
heard of buses departing from major hotels.  Jose and Jimmy set off in
search of these chartered buses, and find that the Hotel Monteleone has
chartered a fleet of 10 buses with state trooper escort to come in and
evacuate their guests to Houston.  There are 200 extra seats that they
are selling to residents at $45 a seat (at cost).  Jose on his way to
pick up his forgotten green card and passport passes Niko, Melissa, and
Rarig.  He tells them about the buses and to get down there.  Back at
his apartment, Jimmy packs up in 15 minutes, taking mostly gold.  They
get in line.  I'm completely tense.  Then, victory! They have gotten
tickets. Everyone is happy.  I'm relieved, but still tense.  I won't be
able to relax until we are physically on the bus. The buses are
scheduled to arrive at 6:30pm.  Teddy, Jimmy's neighbor who decided to
stay, will securely bar the front door to their building from the
inside at 8pm.  At that point, we won't be able to get back in.

Waiting. 6:30pm comes and goes.  7:30pm.  8:30pm. 9:30pm . waiting for
the fleet of 10 buses.  It's getting dark, and scary.  We have police
with double barrel shotguns to guard us, and protect against a rush on
the buses, but there are only four of them.  The French Quarter is
ominous at night; terrifying if away from the police escort with their
double barrel shotguns.  At this point, a cheer goes up, but instead of
a fleet of ten chartered buses, a single Jefferson Parish school bus
shows up.  The driver gets out & talks with the hotel organizer.  Jose
hovers around nearby, discreetly listening.  The buses have been
commandeered by the police- the Monteleone paid for them, but they have
been stolen by the state.  (The state says they need them to evacuate
the sick and elderly, but why can't the state get ahold of its own
buses???  They should have a fleet of 100 buses taking people out, and
should have had that fleet by Monday night, but instead they do nothing
until a private party takes action to help itself, and then they steal
the buses.)  The hotel manager is livid & angrily but quietly decides
to try to "negotiate" with the state.  He is not letting on to the
guests that the buses have been confiscated- no one knows except those
like Jose that are discreetly but actively gathering information.
Allan Toussaint and his wife coolly gather their bags and get on the
school bus.

Jose speaks to the bus driver.  For $50 cash each, he will take us to
Baton Rouge.  I have $61, Jose has $14, Kip (Jimmy's neighbor, a
transplant patient who needs regular dialysis and is already overdue)
has $20, and Jimmy has $50. I ask desperately and ridiculously if they
take credit cards or checks.  Of course they don't, and in fact they
say that no one in the state is taking credit cards, because of all the
possibility of theft.  Jose turns to me and says "baby, if you want to
take this bus. good luck to you" and I turn back "I won't leave without
you." It's as simple as that.  Then, I beg.  I plead with the bus
driver to take us- that our friend needs dialysis and that this is all
the cash we have.  I explain that we've already given $45 for the
Monteleone ticket.   He agrees to take what we have and we scramble on
board.  I love the feel of sitting on the hard metal floor of the
stripped out bus.  But I'm not relaxed yet.  This bus, too, could be
confiscated.  (The police have tried twice to confiscate his bus, but
he managed to escape.)   I hold my knees close, and pray that we make
it to Baton Rouge.  The bus creeps along, silently taking back-streets
out of New Orleans, over the Crescent City Connection (slight release
of tension- we're officially out of the city) and out, through back
roads, looping towards Donaldsville then over the Sunshine Bridge and
then finally onto the I-10 just before Baton Rouge.   At the city, I
can hardly believe the familiar yet strange sight of lighted signs and
streetlights.  It has been pitch black in New Orleans since Sunday
night.  You can see the stars in the sky.

We are dropped off at the airport.  I ask the bus driver for his
address, so I can send him the difference.  He declines (of course;
this is obviously a pirated bus), and I thank him profusely.  He will
return to New Orleans throughout the night to rescue people wanting to
escape.

Finally believing that we have really escaped, I can sigh in exhausted
relief.  The airport, full of refugees sleeping on the floor, is a
wonderful place.  We plug in our cell phones, and call Andre & Laura.
They are there in minutes with their car to pick us up.   Their house
is luxurious, and Andre even cooks up some eggs and toast, with sliced
tomatoes, for us.  It is like heaven to be here, truly heavenly.

As the stories come spilling out of us, my happiness is marred only by
a terrible sense of sadness for the others left behind, in the terror
of a city steadily evacuated by bohemians and working class people and
taken over by criminals and soldiers.  The worst are the people still
on their roofs, sitting there without food or water for days on end, or
drowning.  Also, the animals. Our neighbors, in a move of supremely
cruel irresponsibility, left their dog in their apartment, locked in
there.  They told us nothing when they evacuated, did not give us a
key, and we had no way of getting in.  We heard the dog desperately
scratching against the wall on Tuesday night, but were afraid to go
outside to do anything about it.  Wednesday, we heard no more sound
from him.  I feel incredibly guilty for not breaking a barred window to
at least give him a chance to get out, in case he was still alive.  I
only hope that perhaps they left a long term supply of food and water,
and that he is alive and only quiet, and will survive until they get
back.  I wish that I could go back, in an official vehicle loaded with
water and supplies, to just drop off supplies and pick up people,
taking them back and forth to Baton Rouge.   But they are letting no
one in to help.  People outside the city want desperately to come in
and rescue their friends and family members, and I'm sure many are
willing to drive in supplies.   If the government were competent to
take care of the situation, then they could indeed take over.  But they
are NOT.  (It is just one example that they can't get their shit
together to get their own buses, just confiscating the buses of those
who are more competent than they.)  They NEED to LET PEOPLE BACK IN so
they can help the residents trapped in the city.

Postscript:  The day after writing this, Jose talked with an NPR
reporter who told him what happened after we left.  It is too horrific
to believe, but this is what the reporter said. After unsuccessfully
negotiating with the State, the Hotel Monteleone told the 500 people
waiting that the buses would in fact never come.  Then, they closed
their doors!  They left the people outside, on the streets in the dead
of night in the dead-black lawless French Quarter!  Some of the people
cowered in Jackson Square in terror, while others tried to walk across
the Crescent City Connection.  They were, according to this source,
then shot at by the police!  They were not allowed to leave.  Jose and
I just broke down into wracking sobs, so tremendously helpless are we
to help these others.  I'm hoping this is untrue, I'm praying that this
is not true and that those other waiting people eventually got out
OK.   How could it be true?  Andre Codrescu, who we are staying with,
assures me that it is true, and not a rumor, but I am still praying
that there has been some mistake.  How could it be true?  How could it?

Laura sent me her message, too, which I've been passing around, as
well.  She also informed me that she is also from California, which
perhaps mitigates the insult, such as it was.

I'm finding excellent work at americablog.blogspot.com on this terrible
event and the criminal mismanagement that has followed.

Hi, everyone.  I thought I would share this e-mail as
its content is about fundraising for Katrina victims.
I just moved to Atlanta a month ago and would like to
participate in organizing such an event with writers
in the area.  I would like to read and contribute a
donation as well.  Who else wants to read?  Where
should we hold the event?  (I just started teaching at
Clayton State University, maybe there is a possibility
at Spivey Hall if we ask for a set donation--I would
have to find out).

Best,

last week is also on his Air America radio show. Download this week's
show from the link below, then about 1 minute 45 seconds into it,
Mistachuck reads his poem.

He introduces it by saying he wrote the poem after speaking to his dad
about the situation in N.O. then spent about 45 minutes coming up with
the word. Check it out here

HELL NO, WE AINT ALLRIGHT


New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell NO, we Aint Allright

Now all these press conferences
breakin news alerts
this just in
while your government looks
for a war to win
flames from the blame game, names?
where do i begin?
walls closin in
get some help to my kin
Who cares?
while the rest of the bushnation stares
as the drama unfolds
as we the people under the stares
50% of this son of a bush nation
is like hatin on haiti
an settin up assasinations
ask Pat Robertson- quiz him.....
...smells like terrorism.
racism in the news
still one sided news
saying whites find food
prey for the national guard ready to shoot
cause them blacks loot

New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell NO, we Aint Allright

Fires , earthquakes, tsunamis
i dont mean to scare
wasnt this written somewhere?
disgraces all i see is black faces
moved out to all these places
emergency state
corpses, alligators and snakes
big difference
between this haze
and them diamonds on the VMAs
we better look
whats really important
under this sun
especially if you over 21
this aint no tv show
this aint no video
this is really real
beyond them same ol 'keep it real'
quotes from them Tv stars drivin big rim cars
'streets be floodin, 'b'
no matter where you at, no gas
driving is a luxury
urgency
state of emergency
shows somebodys government
is far from reality....

New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell NO, we Aint Allright


I see here we be the new faces of refugees
who aint even overseas but here on our knees
forget the plasma TV-aint no electricity
new worlds upside down-and out of order
shelter? food? wsssup, wheres the water?
no answers from disaster them masses hurtin
so who the fk we call?--Halliburton?
son of a bush, how you gonna trust that cat?
to fix sht
when help is stuck in Iraq?
makin war plans takin more stands
in Afganistan
2000 soldiers dyin in the sand
but thats over there, right?
now what's over here
is a noise so loud
that some cant hear
but on TV i can see
bunches of people
lookin just like me..

Besides the lame gesture of blaming the French--talk about shifting
blame!--yr anecdote makes the current spectacle of our racist system sound
like a "southern problem."  Events of last Nov. 2 in Ohio--perhaps less
spectacular but no less horrifying in their political implications--seem to
indicate otherwise.

And speaking of Ohio--beyond Nov. 2, 2004--my poem on senator Steve Chabot is up today, Labor Day (quite appropriate) at Boyd Spahr's "order & decorum (www.personnagesobscuras.com)" 440 days of poetic interrogations/assaults/etc. Others on this list have been or will be up there too.

2) call me petty and insipid, but I'm old enough to have seen that such
generalizations are seldom harmless

3) my point was the fairly simple, legible and now, yes, reasserted one that
now, a time when there is great need for all of us in all parts of the country
to do whatever we can to help, may not be the best time to assert distinctions
about relative levels of heartlessness in different regions --

4) I do recall, from the wreckage of the Northridge earth quake, that those of
us who were appealing for assistance from other parts of the country then
thought that we should pay attention to our rhetoric if we wanted to succeed --
a lesson I seem to have made the fatal error of recalling in this moment of
horribly greater wreckage

5) I am pleased to learn that you will waste no more energy on this --

yours, cluelessly bi-coastal,
aldon

Some of us are heartbroken. Some of us are pissed as hell. Who gives a shit

Tell Bush & Congress: Accept Cuba's offer to send doctors to the
hurricane victims!


 On the evening of September 2, Cuban President Fidel Castro reiterated
Cuba's offer (first made on August 30) to send doctors and medical
equipment to provide desperately-needed assistance to those who have
become the victims of both Hurricane Katrina and of the Bush
administration's meager and dilatory response.

Tell Bush & Congress: Accept Cuba's offer to send doctors to the

 Urgent Alert - Take Action Now!

 Tell Bush & Congress:
 Accept Cuba's offer to
 send doctors to the hurricane victims!

 The A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition has set up an easy-to-use way to send Bush
and Congress a message. Use the link below to tell them: "Accept Cuba's
offer to send doctors to the hurricane victims!"

 On the evening of September 2, Cuban President Fidel Castro reiterated
Cuba's offer (first made on August 30) to send doctors and medical
equipment to provide desperately-needed assistance to those who have
become the victims of both Hurricane Katrina and of the Bush
administration's meager and dilatory response.

 Specifically, Cuba is offering to send 1,100 medical doctors with 26.4
tons of medications and diagnosis kits at no expense to the U.S. (they
will even bring their own food and water). There is now a dire need for
medical attention in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and in other
Southern states. The Cuban doctors, nurses and professional healthcare
staff are world renowned for their medical expertise and their ability
to provide assistance even in the most difficult conditions, and have
traveled throughout the Americas and the world providing care to those
in need. The people of Cuba, even with far less resources than the
United States, have survived extreme hurricanes and flooding because the
government mobilizes to put people first, evacuating hundreds of
thousands and providing necessary food, water and medical care immediately.

 These doctors and the medicine and equipment stand ready to fly to
Houston and can arrive within hours as soon as they get permission -
permission that thus far has not been given by the U.S. government. In
their public statements about countries that have offered assistance,
the Bush administration has not even acknowledged this offer from Cuba.

 Bush's racist and cavalier conduct towards the dying and suffering in
New Orleans has been criminal. For him to withhold this medical support
from people in need is cruel and outrageous. He will let even more
people die needlessly just to support his right-wing political agenda
against Cuba.

 You can send a letter to Congress and Bush today demanding that the
U.S. allow the Cuban doctors to enter the country and begin assisting in
the relief efforts! A.N.S.W.E.R. has set up an easy-to-use mechanism to
facilitate sending a quick email to George W. Bush and the Congressional
Representative in your District and Senators in your state with your
demand. We have provided a sample letter, but you can customize your
message to get your point across. Please take a moment now, by clicking
here, to send a message to Bush and Congress.

 Cuban President Fidel Castro reiterates medical care offer
 to the American people in his remarks during the TV round table,
 September 2, 2005, 6:00 pm:

 "Our country is ready to send, in the small hours of morning, 100
clinicians and specialists in Comprehensive General Medicine, who at
dawn tomorrow, Saturday, could be in Houston International Airport,
Texas, the closest to the region struck by the tragedy, in order to be
transferred by air, sea or river to the isolated shelters, facilities
and neighborhoods in the city of New Orleans, where the population and
families are that require emergency medical care or first aid.

 "These Cuban personnel would be carrying backpacks with 24 kilograms of
medications, known to be essential in such situations to save lives, as
well as basic diagnosis kits. They would be prepared to work alone or in
groups of two or more, depending on the circumstances, for as long as
necessary.

 "Likewise, Cuba is ready to send via Houston, or any other airport of
your choosing, 500 additional specialists in Comprehensive General
Medicine, with the same equipment, who could be at their destination
point at noon or in the afternoon of tomorrow, Saturday, September 3.

 "A third group of 500 specialists in Comprehensive General Medicine
could be arriving in the morning of Sunday, September 4. Thus, the 1100
said medical doctors, with the resources described tantamount to 26.4
tons of medications and diagnosis kits, would be caring for the neediest
persons in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.

 "These medical doctors have the necessary international experience and
elementary knowledge of the English language that would allow them to
communicate with the
 patients.

 "We stand ready waiting for the US authorities' response."

 Support the STOP Movement! STOP: Stop The Oppressive Politics!

 We the people of the United States of America have gathered together to
express our views against the oppression of people across the Earth by
the imperialistic policy makers of our government. They want all the
nations of the world to bow down and abide by rules and laws they impose
behind the curtain of the United Nations, yet when those laws go against
the political agenda of the administration they themselves break the law
and feloniously fabricate propaganda to mislead the world and American
people that Iraq has "Weapons of Mass Destruction", and will use them on
America. Evidence to validate this fantasy still to this day does not
exist, even after the CIA unsuccessfully tried to fabricate documents to
prove so. Next we have the shameful attempt by Governor Bush and his
gang to link the unfortunate events of September 11th and Osama Bin
Laden to the leadership of the Iraqi Government. Proof or evidence of
which also does not exist. Mr. Bush has been left with no other card in
his deck to play, so he created his own, the deck of "Wanted Terrorists"
within a charade of humanitarianism. The only way for him to gain any
popular acceptance is to have a campaign of misleading propaganda to
make us believe that he's on a self-righteous mission to liberate the
Iraqi people, and that this war is a war about freedom and democracy for
the people of Iraq. This is yet another delusion of grandeur by our
so-called fearless leader. He will not hoodwink or deceive us! America's
oppressive foreign policy, which resorts to bribery, corruption, dirty
dealings, and murder assassination, will continue to produce hatred,
mistrust, and animosity. This dangerous environment that our policies
have bred puts us at far greater risk of being blind sided and harmed by
threats unknown. This threat multiplies with each aggression toward the
nations of the world. Aggression sometimes concealed behind diplomacy,
which can be more dangerous than war itself. This hostile behavior must
stop. If we are going to start opening the books and passing judgment on
world leaders lets not hesitate to start with members of our government.
Let's also call out the governments of some our so-called allies. Then
we can all be playing eye-to-eye on an even field. Until then, take a
stand to S.T.O.P. the oppressive politics. Stop the killing of other
nation's children and bring our sons and daughters home.

 Peace,

 ""His media lap dogs attempted to deflect criticism by focusing on the
"looters" yet pictures of white looters were captioned as desperate
folks who "found" food and water amidst the floods and debris yet blacks
in the same situation were characterized as criminals. The initial focus
was not on rescues but on moral condemnation of the victims and law
enforcement! This was unquestionably because those still stranded in New
Orleans were poor blacks and the sick and rich white folks especially
those who inhabit the Bu$h administration have shown they have no
compassion for folks like them. Thanks be to the CREATOR that the rest
of humanity regardless of political ideology and persuasion have
compassion and are willing to lend a helping hand to their follow humans
even though they may (or may not) have less than the

I didn't get a chance to read Laura Mullen's post that began this discussion,
but some of the responses to it and to the whole issue of the terrible
catastrophe in New Orleans have me breaking into a sweat here.

Blaming the French for a city near water? Wondering whether, were Laura, a
terrific poet, to write a poem about New Orleans, could she write in the style
(s) that she is accustomed to, etc.  Meanwhile, Rome burns, and we sound,
pardon me, like a bunch of blithering idiots.

Did anyone read Frank Rich in the NYT yesterday? He pretty much sums up the
various problems and political attitudes that have led to the vast panorama of
suffering that we see down there.  It doesn't take a poet to understand
misery, graft, the misuse of our tax-depleted national coffers for a
ridiculous war that has us underprepared when disaster strikes here, the vast
indifference to the suffering of poor people, evacuation orders for people w/o
cars that involve nothing to help them evacuate (15% of white and 35% of black
New Orleans citizens have no cars), etc.

Nothing I am saying is new or original, but one could easily ask if we're
thinking through the BIG problem of the moment, how our dubiously elected
government is once again falling far short of merely supplying basic needs,
not to mention larger planning that leads to funds being spent on important
long-term issues such as global warming and infrastructure that impacts major
disasters like this one and ones to come.

So let's not ponder Laura Mullen's facility for political poems or what city
planner thought of the ridiculous idea of building on a coast or how many
pralines are floating amid the dead animals and human corpses.

my interpretation of what disaster means and net art.
there is always net art of the disaster.
http://www.asondheim.org/godslove.jpg
the failure of the network in new orleans: not us.
we have emblazoned the pattern.
portraits appear at the least likely of circumstances.
every day something new while we travel west to east.
sunny days and not a cloud in sight, bang you're dead.
no deal! help is on the way. and one severed sentence
says it all [take this line out]
says nothing at all

New Orleans, the Making of an Urban Catastrophe
Draft , September 2, 2005
Robert Caldwell

Most residents of metro New Orleans were unaware of the potential
destruction of Katrina until Saturday August 28, less than 48 hours before
it struck.

In New Orleans violent tropical storms are routine and hurricanes are a
seasonal reminder of the power of "mother nature."  As a resident of the
city I have often been faced with a choice of whether or not to evacuate,
always judging whether this would be the fabled "big one."  Hurricane
Katrina was the most awesome disaster that residents of Louisiana have ever
seen.  But the deadly results of Katrina were as much a produce of human
callousness as an act of nature.

The world watched as people were herded into the Superdome stopping for
searches only to find themselves in a wrenched and unsanitary place with
food, water, or proper medical care. Those in areas of high flooding fled
to their rooftops begging rescue helicopters to airlift them to safety.
Many died trapped in their attics or waiting to be rescued. Meanwhile
hundreds of police were dispached to protect property from looters.

At least half the city is at or below sea level including the Central
Business District and much of the housing stock of the city.  Under normal
conditions massive drainage pumps drain rainwater from the city. But even
under "normal" conditions, poor areas of the city routinely face minor
flooding.

As Hurricane Katrina promises to be the new textbook case for urban
"natural" disasters, social dislocation, and (lack of) urban planning, it
is important to begin to examine the social dimension of the failed
policies that contributed to such a massive disaster.

Misguided Priorities

New Orleans is a city "underdeveloped" by capitalism.  Social services are
chronically underfunded, while working people depend on low wage service
jobs and send their kids to dysfunctional public schools. Despite its once
massive port, a seventy mile petro-chemical corridor and historical
significance, the city has, like third- world Caribbean islands, depended
on scraps of the tourism industry for its sustenance.

So it may be no surprise that in the leadup to Katrina flood Louisiana
hurricane preparedness was woefully under-funded by President Bush and
Congress.

Bush and Congress ignored those who explained that the critical
infrastructure that would prevent  New Orleans from becoming inundated with
flood waters in the event of a levy break.  In a 2003 interview of Bill
Moyers' NOW, scientist Daniel Zwerdling noted the cutting of Hurricane
funding to pay for the war in Iraq. According to columnist Sidney
Blumenthal, "FEMA warned that a hurricane striking New Orleans was one of
the three most likely disasters in the U.S. But the Bush administration cut
New Orleans flood control funding by 44 percent to pay for the Iraq war."

Congress did authorize $10.5 billion dollars for Gulf Coast aid, but
Florida received $16 billion when hurricanes hit in 2004.  Contrast this
amount with the  $162 billion Congress appropriated for the first year of
the Iraq war.

At the time of the hurricane, almost half of the Louisiana National Guard
was deployed outside the state.  Some, like the 3,000 members of the 256th
Infantry Brigade were reportedly with critical high water equipment, in
Iraq.


The race and class dynamics of a planned catastrophe

The poverty and blackness of those bearing the brunt of the hurricane is
obvious to anyone watching CNN.  The plight of these victims underscores
the existing race and class inequalities in New Orleans but our case also
provides a lens in which to understand another facet of the racism that is
ever-present in the United States.

Poor people were the most ill prepared for a hurricane. Malik Rahim, Green
Party candidate and former Black panther explains:

"The hurricane hit at the end of the month, the time when poor people are
most vulnerable. Food stamps don't buy enough but for about three weeks of
the month, and by the end of the month everyone runs out. Now they have no
way to get their food stamps or any money, so they just have to take what
they can to survive."

The poorest people were without transportation, food, or resources, but no
hurricane preparedness plan-and none of the doomsday exercises of federal,
state, and local agencies made any provisions for their evacuation.
Disaster planning officials know that 112,000 people in New Orleans are
without any private form of transportation. In 2003 the Times Picayune
produced a five part series that predicted that this segment would likely
face death in the event of a category 5 hurricane.

It 's not enough to order an evacuation without having policies in place to
carry an evacuation out.  City and public school buses flooded while
residents were stuck in the city with no way out.

In fact many institutions that once provided evacuation (like the
dormitories of the University of New Orleans) now expected to fend for
themselves, an unforeseen logical extension of privatization and neoliberal
ideology and a continuation of white supremacy.

In an unscripted NBC benefit concert, rapper Kanye West explains:  "George
Bush doesn't care about black people," ?[America was set up] "to help the
poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible." Tulane
Hospital (a private hospital) was evacuated by well before Charity
Hospital, the region's trauma hospital and the hospital, whose patients are
poor, overwhelmingly black. Tenet paid private contractors to evacuate at
least one of their hospitals.

Katrina was not the first hurricane, nor the first major flooding disaster
to hit Louisiana.  During Hurricane Betsy Lower Ninth Ward, an area almost
entirely under the poverty line and 99% black, was intentionally flooded to
"save" the wealthy white uptown neighborhoods.

Institutional policies favor ruling class interests, but the flipside of
these policies is for purveyors of ruling class ideology- including many
working class whites to blame the victims hit hardest: poor African
Americans, which, in turn, sharpens existing race and class inequalities.
According to Malik Rahim, white vigilante gangs  were patrolling Algiers, "
riding around in pickup  trucks, all of them armed, and any young Black
they see who they figure doesn't belong in their community, they shoot
him."

Blaming Victims

Both FEMA chief Don Brown and the dominant media spin indicate that the
high death toll is "going to be attributable a lot to people who did not
heed the advance warnings."  Brown's comments suggest that hundreds of
thousands foolishly "choose" not to evacuate, but the reality is that tens
of thousands of New Orleanians did not have the means to comply with an
evacuation order.

Reporters and rightwing internet trolls filled news outlets and message
boards with racialized stories of looting, while tens of thousands of the
city begged for help.  The lawlessness of looting, full of drama and
intrigue of savage black people provided a narrative that shifted focus
away from the thousands still stuck in the horror and the political
decisions that kept them in that hell.  Officials comforted tense onlookers
with a promise of order: they would use troops to protect stores from
looting.  But by doing so, they shifted scarce resources away from the
search, rescue, and evacuation of residents whose lives they deemed less
important.

As convoys of National Guard reinforcements finally rolled into New
Orleans, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco used the occasion to warned
looters and assure the ruling class that troops were under her orders to
"shoot and kill" if needed to restore order.  "These troops are
battle-tested. They have M-16s and are locked and loaded," she said. "These
troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will."

Lackluster Response

The response from Federal agencies was too little too late. While the
United States has a history of dropping humanitarian relief to famine and
disaster affected areas, media reported that supplies were being diverted
because helicopters could not land, or because of a report of hostile
gunfire.

If the United States is capable of sending planes that can withstand enemy
fire to drop bombs in Iraq, certainly they are capable of air dropping
supplies into a US city.

On NPR's All Things Considered  (September 1st, 2005,
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4828771) Homeland
Security Czar Michael Chertoff dismissed an NPR field reporter's claim that
2,000 or more were at Convention Center without food or water and in
unsanitary conditions. Subsequent reports verify that 15,000-20,000 were at
the convention center in deplorable conditions including dead bodies.  The
Convention Center was on dry ground and would have been accessible by
military transport ground vehicles of helicopters.

Mayor Ray Nagin blasted the slow response: "They're not here. It's too
doggone late. Now get off your asses and do something, and let's fix the
biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country."

An elected official from Jefferson Parish (New Orleans suburbs) suggested
that if New Orleans were to secede from the Unites States perhaps foreign
aid would be more timely. On the evening of September 2, 2005 frustrated
FOX News reporters called attention to the policies that continued to trap
refugees at the convention center.

Environmental Trigger

Looking at this disaster one cannot ignore the ecological component.  New
Orleans, like many major cities, was built in a place that posed danger,
but environmental problems of global warming and coastal erosion have
exacerbated the precariousness of the city.

Marshes and wetlands help to slow a hurricane's effect as it approaches the
city.  But erosion has diminished the size and ability of the coastal marsh
and swamp to absorb the hurricane's force.   Coastal erosion has two
important causes.  One is that the once rich river silt that built the
delta is now being directed to deep waters off the continental shelf to
allow for easy river navigation.  The second is salt water intrusion from
canals built for oil and natural gas drilling and pipeline needs.

Global warming has contributed to a deadly hurricane season that is not yet
over.  Ross Gelbspan, columnist for the Boston Globe, explains that global
warming "generates longer droughts, more-intense downpours, more-frequent
heat waves, and more-severe storms." While Katrina began "as a relatively
small hurricane that glanced off south Florida, it was supercharged with
extraordinary intensity by the relatively  blistering sea surface
temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico."


Conclusion

The Bush administration fiddled while New Orleans flooded. The
administration and Congress failed to provide basic preventative
infrastructure and failed to have a rescue plan in place, choosing instead
tax cuts for the rich and war spending in Iraq.   This is the last in a
line of Bush failures, and is seen so by a growing segment of the
population as a "war at home" on poor and Black people.

Many hurricane refugees rightly feel abandoned. But the ruling class
abandoned New Orleans long before Katrina hit.  Racism, environmental
disregard and capitalist deference to "the market" for social planning have
long been the hallmarks of New Orleans.

Eventually public money will begin to trickle into the state. Hotels,
casinos, chain stores and "Disneyfied" developments will compete for the
sorely needed money and serve to reinforce a system that was unable to
respond to peoples' needs before, during, and immediately after the
hurricane.

But New Orleans can be rebuilt with a different ethos, one with
environmentally sustainable planning, a vast transportation infrastructure
upgrade, including public evacuation plans, a bolstered public works
system, creation of stable union jobs, new public schools, a renewed
investment in the public healthcare system, and cultivation of
participatory neighborhood councils as incubators for a new, participatory,
and radical democracy among
the working class, poor, and oppressed.

And the people of the United States can help with an alternative vision.
First we should demand that troops deployed in Iraq return to the United
States, and we should link this return to a change in national priorities
focused on focusing on the needs of working and oppressed people, beginning
with rebuilding the infrastructure of New Orleans and the US Gulf South.

Open Letter to Bush from the New Orleans, Times Picayune 

09/05/05

09/04/05 The Times-Picayune Letter:

We heard you loud and clear Friday when you visited our devastated city and
the Gulf Coast and said, "What is not working, we're going to make it right."

Please forgive us if we wait to see proof of your promise before believing
you. But we have good reason for our skepticism.

Bienville built New Orleans where he built it for one main reason: It's
accessible. The city between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain was
easy
to reach in 1718.

How much easier it is to access in 2005 now that there are interstates and
bridges, airports and helipads, cruise ships, barges, buses and diesel-powered
trucks.

Despite the city's multiple points of entry, our nation's bureaucrats spent
days after last week's hurricane wringing their hands, lamenting the fact that
they could neither rescue the city's stranded victims nor bring them food,
water and medical supplies.

Meanwhile there were journalists, including some who work for The
Times-Picayune, going in and out of the city via the Crescent City Connection.
On
Thursday morning, that crew saw a caravan of 13 Wal-Mart tractor trailers headed
into
town to bring food, water and supplies to a dying city.

Television reporters were doing live reports from downtown New Orleans
streets. Harry Connick Jr. brought in some aid Thursday, and his efforts were
the
focus of a "Today" show story Friday morning.

Yet, the people trained to protect our nation, the people whose job it is to
quickly bring in aid were absent. Those who should have been deploying troops
were singing a sad song about how our city was impossible to reach.

We're angry, Mr. President, and we'll be angry long after our beloved city
and surrounding parishes have been pumped dry. Our people deserved rescuing.
Many who could have been were not. That's to the government's shame.

Mayor Ray Nagin did the right thing Sunday when he allowed those with no
other alternative to seek shelter from the storm inside the Louisiana Superdome.

We still don't know what the death toll is, but one thing is certain: Had the
Superdome not been opened, the city's death toll would have been higher. The
toll may even have been exponentially higher.

It was clear to us by late morning Monday that many people inside the
Superdome would not be returning home. It should have been clear to our
government,
Mr. President. So why weren't they evacuated out of the city immediately? We
learned seven years ago, when Hurricane Georges threatened, that the Dome isn't
suitable as a long-term shelter. So what did state and national officials
think would happen to tens of thousands of people trapped inside with no air
conditioning, overflowing toilets and dwindling amounts of food, water and other

essentials?

State Rep. Karen Carter was right Friday when she said the city didn't have
but two urgent needs: "Buses! And gas!" Every official at the Federal Emergency
Management Agency should be fired, Director Michael Brown especially.

In a nationally televised interview Thursday night, he said his agency hadn't
known until that day that thousands of storm victims were stranded at the
Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. He gave another nationally televised
interview the next morning and said, "We've provided food to the people at the
Convention Center so that they've gotten at least one, if not two meals, every
single
day."

Lies don't get more bald-faced than that, Mr. President.

Yet, when you met with Mr. Brown Friday morning, you told him, "You're doing
a heck of a job."

That's unbelievable.

There were thousands of people at the Convention Center because the
riverfront is high ground. The fact that so many people had reached there on
foot is
proof that rescue vehicles could have gotten there, too.

We, who are from New Orleans, are no less American than those who live on the
Great Plains or along the Atlantic Seaboard. We're no less important than
those from the Pacific Northwest or Appalachia. Our people deserved to be
rescued.

No expense should have been spared. No excuses should have been voiced.
Especially not one as preposterous as the claim that New Orleans couldn't be
reached.

Mr. President, we sincerely hope you fulfill your promise to make our beloved
communities work right once again.

When you do, we will be the first to applaud.

Dear Kalamu:

Wishing you safe journeys. Freddi was very upset when she heard that you
don't plan to come back to New Orleans. She has been under a tremendous
strain here because her brother is sick and had to be hospitalized for a
few days right after the storm. I think that she had not yet started to
grieve and that the announcement finally triggered some of those
feelings. We are, however working on the book. Freddi brought all her
papers and notes, we have made out a schedule for putting the finishing
touches on the draft and have been able to keep to it so far. I think it
is even more important than ever to get this book out and I also think
it will have a far greater audience than it might have found before Katrina.

I have been encouraging everyone to write. It is an important part of
the healing process but it is also important for us to document the
culture and history of New Orleans from our perspective. Yesterday
afternoon we had "workshop." Aumra read a very beautiful piece which
asserts that the spirit and culture of New Orleans lives on in its
people. We are applying to the blackamericaweb.com relief fund so I
wrote an essay showing how precarious "middle class" status is for black
Americans. We all ended up riding with Freddi because even though we are
professionals, we didn't have road worthy cars. Will forward these
pieces to you once we finish polishing them.

Yesterday I also bought Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents.
I will encourage everyone to read and discuss them because Butler's
prophetic vision of social and economic collapse is coming true.

The good news is that Loyola is going to pay us through December. Aumra
will also receive his regular salary.

Other people need the computer so I have to go.

Take care,
Love,
P.

paulette,

i just spent over a half hour writing a detailed repsonse and aol
crashed. and at the same time, greta (whom you don't know but who was
critical to our sac work) called and the phone just quit, flat out quit,
battery is refusing to re-charge. i just leaned back in the chair,
closed my eyes and paused for a moment.

the challenges are overwhelming. overwhelming.

ok. i'm not going to even try to re-write what i had been saying. also,
this is now a public statement and not just an exchange between us.

message to the workshop

1. freddi, i realize how distressing my statement about not moving back
to new orleans may seem, but it was simply a statement of fact. none of
us are going back anytime soon. and when it is no longer soon, eight
months from now, a year from now, most of us will not be able to leave
whatever we have established wherever we are and journey back to the
"new" new orleans in the process of being born. indeed, i am certain
there will be no invitation to the hundreds of thousands of poor black
people--the very people who created and sustained the culture of new
orleans as it was known and celebrated worldwide.

my position is simple:

haiku #45
black people believe
in god and i believe in
black people. amen.

for me it's all about the people and not simply (or reductively) about
the place where the people lived, struggled and died. indeed, this is an
inaugural moment in the 21st century history of the united states and of
the world. 9-1-1, iraq and now new orleans. times of great change,
unforseeable as to the twists and turns life will take.

freddi, i am not giving up on new orleans, it is just that i do not
identify new orleans primarily with the place. i identify new orleans
with our people, and where our people are, there i must be, one way or
another. that's my decision, i do not think that has to be everyone
else's position. nor do i think my position is more principled, more
correct, more anything than anyone else's position. my position is just
that, my position.

at the same time i recognize that what i do affects more than just me. i
recognize that, to varying degrees, i am perceived as a leader, so that
what i do has a lot of influence. in that regard, i want to be clear.
far from giving up or abandoning new orleans, i plan to become even more
engaged, even more active, more dedicated.

each of us has to make the decisions we need to make to live and
continue. i embrace each of you and offer whatever support i can as you
move forward individually and collectively. for those who choose to do
so, i feel a responsibility to help continue our collective work, but
within the scope of our past focus and within the scope of a new and
broader focus created by extraordinary times and events.

let us respond to events as agents of change rather than soley as
objects of change. although limited in resources, mobility and
opporutnity, all of us can still to some degree make a choice, make a
difference, and act as a conscious agent of change. we must will
ourselves to make the world better and more beautiful than it is now.

specifically, freddi, my current plans are to set up oakland as a home
base but to spend the next year on the road, with a neo-griot team,
recording the history of new orleans and the voices of displaced new
orleanians. the specifics of this are yet to be worked through and
indeed this may change, i could find myself based somewhere else, even
baton rouge (although i hope not, there's too many politicians to the
square inch in baton rouge--that's a joke that will be lost on folk not
from new orleans). but this is my vision and my commitment.

also, i can easily envision moving the neo-griot new orleans project
base back to the "new" new orleans after a year or so, but that is much
further on down the road. for the immediate term, i will be on the road
going from place to place to further the project and also as a way of
earning a living.

2. paulette, you are the new director of the workshop. let me know if
you accept the responsibility. you have already written the most
comprehensive history of the workshop. you were the associate director.
you are where there is the largest concentration of workshop members. we
need you to step forward and take charge on the ground.

this is a historical moment that is thrust upon us. hopefully we can
respond. on the ground in madison, mississippi there are two immediate
tasks we need to prepare to complete. a) the completion of freddi's book
on congo square and b) the neo griot workshop website, both of which we
had already discussed.

a) congo square book
freddi, this book takes on monumental importance at this juncture. we
are very close to the finish. my vision is that the work i am doing and
the contacts i have will enable us to get a major publisher for this
book in partnership with runagate. here is what i suggest--and, i await
your response before putting any of this into effect:

 >contact marie brown, who is perhaps the premiere literary agent
concentrating on african american oriented literature. marie has already
been in touch with me about personal matters and stands ready to help.
the help i would ask would be to get freddi's book published.

we need to face both our opportunities and our limitations. the history
of congo square that freddi has put together along with the major imput
of a number of people including paulette as a translator, this book is
absolutely necessary. i know it can be done. indeed, i am certain we
will be able to get both a u.s. publisher and an international publisher.

on your end paulette, please focus on getting the final edits together.
the target ought to be no later than october 1 for the completion of a
computer file of the book.

paulette, we need an inventory of illustrations/pictures--what we have,
what we still need to get, what format material is in, etc. you know
that process. let's get it completed.

freddi, there's no pressure on you to finish the final touches on the
manuscript, just get it done by october 1, 2005.

again, with all of the above i await your response whether you accept
the work sketched out above. please feel free to make whatever changes
you feel necessary. i am suggesting a direction. you all on the ground
have to determine the specific steps to take.

i await your response before making any further moves with regard to
freddi's history of congo square book.

b) neo-griot workshop website
paulette, i want to get the neo-griot workshop website up within two
months. it's going to take a minute to get everything ready. the site
has to be designed. we have server space already paid for and ready to
use. when mtume and i did breath of life, i recognized that we were
going to run out of space within a year, so we purchase space on a
different server. we actually have two servers up and ready to use.

as for the neo-griot website, paulette, you will need to be the site
moderator, if not long term, at least to get us up and running.

as a professor at loyola university you are used to teaching literature
and have already done a lot of work using websites. so the learning
curve will not be too steep for you.

additionally, paulette, please keep on holding workshop. gather up the
writings. in fact, that might be something to start working
on--contacting folk wherever they are. (we can get together online later
and i will share the contacts i have and the info i have on where folk
are.) see what material we have. whatever it may be. journals. completed
pieces. incomplete pieces. whatever. more in a minute on that.

in any case, let me know if you are ok with becoming the workshop
director. don't feel any pressure to accept the position. either it's
yes or no, and in either case you have my support and my embrace as we
move forward with whatever our individual and collective plans are.

3. the third mirgration
this is the third major migration. 1st migration = slavery. 2nd
migration = the great migration of the 20th century (which actually
stretches from post-reconstruction thru the great depression). 3rd
migration = new orleans.

we are looking at well over three million people displaced. and in this
case, when i say "new orleans" i mean more than new orleans proper. i
mean the areas affected by katrina in general, but also specifically
mean the poor and black of new orleans. i have a dual focus in mind, and
we should not allow one of the focii to disappear the other, i.e. we
can't just consider the black and poor from new orleans, but at the same
time we can't simply assume a focus on the victims of katrina will deal
with the concerns of the black and poor in new orleans.

by the way, have you seen aaron broussad's statement as president of
jefferson parish. i have been seeing a number of statements that suggest
that not many poor whites have been affected, that all the whites are
rich and all the blacks are wretched. i don't think that is a correct
assesment. when you see aaron broussard (who is not poor), he makes
clear that there are a lot of whites affected, many of whom are utterly
devastated by what has happened. if we do not consider their plight and
are not at the very least willing to include them in our circle of
concern we deserve to be forgotten about. period.

to see broussard's statement (and i urge you to do so) go to:
http://www.bradblog.com/archives/00001798.htm

we need to document this migration from the viewpoint of those caught up
in it. people are always talking about giving voice to the voiceless,
but this is no simple matter. some of us have been studying this issue
for a long time. have been talking about it for a long time. well, guess
what, now is the time.

i will have a prelimenary outline completed tomorrow and will share it
with everyone at that time.

4.) dialogue and community
we have got to keep that going. if we stop we will die. we are far flung
at the moment. isolated we will not only fall apart, we will shrivel up
and become dsyfunctional, if not outright die. let us keep talking with
each other, wherever we are, howsoever we can.

personally, i am overwhelmed with emails, my cell phone is down. it is
sometimes almost impossible. sometimes i find myself just staring into
space. i feel like balling up in a fetal position and not moving... but,
i won't. i can't. we must continue.

but at the same time we who are relatively safe must understand that
none of us is truly safe. mentally we are all traumatized.

whatever we say one moment, can change the next. whatever we believe one
moment, can change the next. please bear with us, bear with each other,
bear with yourself. it may sound crazy but this is the moment with which
we have to deal, and this dealing will not be easy.

bear with each other. we could blow up over a minor point (or a major
issue) one minute, and tomorrow feel very badly that we did or said what
we did.

people may be trying to reach out and offer us help. and we may not
respond in a timely manner. or we may not respond at all. we may not say
a damn thing. just ignore everything. but this is part of the pattern of
being traumatized. please bear with us. bear with each other.

ignore us when we lash out. don't be discouraged with each other. only
steady day to day dialogue and community will help many of us over come
our trauma. steady. day to day. dialogue and community.

it's taken a lot of energy to write this. i still have to do e-drum for
today. i'm tired, and relatively speaking i haven't done much. but i'm
going to keep going. i encourage each of us, each in our own way to keep
going.

let us remember those who didn't make. embrace those who did. and keep
on pushing.

more in a minute,

a luta continua,

kalamu

Seven children found wandering together
Six-year-old in charge;
group later reunited
with parents

By The Associated Press


Monday September 05, 2005
BATON ROUGE, La. -- In the chaos that was Causeway
Boulevard, this group of refugees stood out: a
6-year-old boy walking down the road, holding a
5-month-old, surrounded by five toddlers who followed
him around as if he were their leader.

They were holding hands. Three of the children were
about 2 years old, and one was wearing only diapers. A
3-year-old girl, who wore colorful barrettes on the
ends of her braids, had her 14-month-old brother in
tow. The 6-year-old spoke for all of them, and he told
rescuers his name was Deamonte Love.

Thousands of human stories have flown past relief
workers in the last week, but few have touched them as
much as the seven children who were found wandering
together Thursday at an evacuation point in downtown
New Orleans. In the Baton Rouge headquarters of the
rescue operation, paramedics tried to coax their names
out of them; nurses who examined them stayed up that
night, brooding.

Transporting the children alone was "the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life, knowing that their parents
are either dead" or that they had been abandoned, said
Pat Coveney, a Houston emergency medical technician
who put them into the back of his ambulance and drove
them out of New Orleans.

"It goes back to the same thing," he said. "How did a
6-year-old end up being in charge of six babies?"

So far, parents displaced by flooding have reported
220 children missing, but that number is expected to
rise, said Mike Kenner of the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children, which will help
reunite families. With crowds churning at evacuation
points, many children were parted from their parents
accidentally; one woman handed her baby up onto a bus,
turned around to pick up her suitcase and turned back
to find that the bus had left.

At the rescue headquarters, a cool tile-floored
building swarming with firefighters and paramedics,
the children ate cafeteria food and fell into a deep
sleep. Deamonte volunteered his vital statistics. He
said his father was tall and his mother was short. He
gave his address, his phone number and the name of his
elementary school.

He said the 5-month-old was his brother, Darynael, and
that two others were his cousins, Tyreek and Zoria.
The other three lived in his apartment building.

The children were clean and healthy -- downright plump
in the case of the infant, said Joyce Miller, a nurse
who examined them. It was clear, she said, that "time
had been taken with those kids." The baby was "fat and
happy."

"This baby child was terrified," he said. "After she
relaxed, it was gobble, gobble, gobble."

As grim dispatches came in from the field, one woman
in the office burst into tears at the thought that the
children had been abandoned in New Orleans, said
Sharon Howard, assistant secretary of the office of
public health.

Late the same night, they got an encouraging report: A
woman in a shelter in Thibodeaux was searching for
seven children. People in the building started
clapping at the news. But when they got the mother on
the phone, it became clear that she was looking for a
different group of seven children, Howard said.

"What that made me understand was that this was
happening across the state," she said. "That kind of
frightened me."

The children were transferred to a shelter operated by
the Department of Social Services, rooms full of toys
and cribs where mentors from the Big Buddy Program
were on hand day and night. For the next two days, the
staff did detective work.

Deamonte began to give more details to Derrick
Robertson, a 27-year-old Big Buddy mentor: How he saw
his mother cry when he was loaded onto the helicopter.
How he promised her he'd take care of his little
brother.

Late Saturday night, they found Deamonte's mother, who
was in a shelter in San Antonio along with the four
mothers of the other five children. Catrina Williams,
26, saw her children's pictures on a web site set up
over the weekend by the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children. By Sunday, a private plane
from Angel Flight was waiting to take the children to
Texas.

In a phone interview, Williams said she is the kind of
mother who doesn't let her children out of her sight.
What happened the Thursday after the hurricane, she
said, was that her family, trapped in an apartment
building on the 3200 block of Third Street in New
Orleans, began to feel desperate.

The water wasn't going down and they had been living
without light, food or air conditioning for four days.
The baby needed milk and the milk was gone. So she
decided they would evacuate by helicopter. When a
helicopter arrived to pick them up they were told to
send the children first and that the helicopter would
be back in 25 minutes. She and her neighbors had to
make a quick decision.

It was a wrenching moment. Williams' father, Adrian
Love, told her to send the children ahead.

"I told them to go ahead and give them up, because me,
I would give my life for my kids. They should feel the
same way," said Love, 48. "They were shedding tears. I
said, ‘Let the babies go.' "

His daughter and her friends followed his advice.

"We did what we had to do for our kids, because we
love them," Williams said.

The helicopter didn't come back. While the children
were transported to Baton Rouge, their parents wound
up in Texas, and although Williams was reassured that
they would be reunited, days passed without any
contact. On Sunday, she was elated.

"All I know is I just want to see my kids," she said.
"Everything else will just fall into place."

At 3 p.m. Sunday, DSS workers said good-by to seven
children who now had names: Deamonte Love; Darynael
Love; Zoria Love and her brother Tyreek. The girl who
cried "Gabby!" was Gabrielle Janae Alexander. The girl
they called Peanut was Degahney Carter. And the boy
whom they called G was actually Lee -- Leewood Moore
Jr.

The children were strapped into car seats and driven
to an airport, where they were flown to San Antonio to
rejoin their parents. As they loaded into the van, the
shelter workers looked in the windows; some wept.

The baby gaped with delight in the front seat.
Deamonte was hanging onto Robertson's neck so
desperately that Robertson decided, at the last
minute, to ride with him as far as Lafayette.

Shelter worker Kori Thomas, held Zoria, 3, who reached
out to smooth her eyebrows. Tyreek put a single fat
finger on the van window by way of goodbye.

Robertson said he doubted the children would remember
much of the helicopter evacuation, the Causeway, the
sweltering heat or the smell of the flooded city.

"I think what's going to stick with them is that they
survived Hurricane Katrina," he said. "And that they
were loved."

Halliburton Subsidiary Gets Katrina Deal
By LOLITA C. BALDOR
The Associated Press
Sunday, September 4, 2005

WASHINGTON -- A Halliburton Co. subsidiary that has come under fire for its reconstruction work in Iraq has begun tapping a $500 million Navy contract to do emergency repairs at Gulf Coast naval and Marine facilities that were battered by Hurricane Katrina.
   The subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root Services Inc. of Arlington, Va., was awarded the competitive bid contract last July to provide debris removal and other emergency work associated with natural disasters.
   Jan Davis, a spokeswoman for the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, said Sunday that KBR will receive $12 million for work at Naval Air Station Pascagoula, Naval Station Gulfport and Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. It will receive $4.6 million for work at two smaller Navy facilities in New Orleans and others in the South. [...]

Thanks for that. I would think it would be more reassuring were those at the
top of the government heavily invested in disaster prevention rather than
disaster reconstruction.

Dr. Benway to the rescue, eh?

Fantastic idea.  Perhaps the influx of poor and black people will swell the
ranks of the Democrats and influence indigenous Texans to come 'round and
transform Texas from a red to a blue state.

It shouldn't be surprising or scary that the hospitality in Houston is
overwhelming.  Houston, with the possible exception of Austin, is probably
the state's most liberal city.

Barbara: 'Victims poor anyway'

Barbara Bush, the former first lady, courted
controversy by pointing out that many of the people
forced out of their homes by Hurricane Katrina "were
underprivileged anyway". Mrs Bush, who joined her
husband, George, on a tour of the Houston Astrodome,
said: "And so many of the people in the arena here
were underprivileged anyway, so this is working very
well for them. What I'm hearing, which is sort of
scary, is they all want to stay in Texas. Everyone is
so overwhelmed by the hospitality."

I agree Jim. I think this tragedy gives the administration a chance to
bring the graft home.

SPECIAL REPORT: HURRICANE KATRINA WITNESS
Spreading the poison of bigotry

By Howard Witt
Tribune senior correspondent
Published September 4, 2005

BATON ROUGE, La. -- They locked down the entrance doors Thursday at the Baton
Rouge hotel where I'm staying alongside hundreds of New Orleans residents
driven from their homes by Hurricane Katrina. "Because of the riots," the hotel
managers explained. Gunmen from New Orleans were headed this way, they had
heard.

"It's the blacks," whispered one white woman in the elevator. "We always
worried this would happen."

Something else gave way last week besides the levees that had protected New
Orleans from the waters surrounding it. The thin veneer of civility and
practiced cordiality that in normal times masks the prejudices and bigotries
held by
many whites in this region of Deep South Louisiana was heavily battered as
well.

All it took to set the rumor mills in motion were the first TV pictures
broadcast Tuesday showing some looters--many of them black--smashing store
windows
in downtown New Orleans. Reports later in the week of sporadic violence and
shootings among the desperate throngs outside the Superdome clamoring to be
rescued only added to the panic.

By Thursday, local TV and radio stations in Baton Rouge--the only ones in the
metro area still able to broadcast--were breezily passing along reports of
cars being hijacked at gunpoint by New Orleans refugees, riots breaking out in
the shelters set up in Baton Rouge to house the displaced, and guns and knives
being seized.

Scarcely any of it was true--the police, for example, confiscated a single
knife from a refugee in one Baton Rouge shelter. There were no riots in Baton
Rouge. There were no armed hordes.

But all of it played directly into the darkest prejudices long held against
the hundreds of thousands of impoverished blacks who live "down there," in New
Orleans, that other world regarded by many white suburbanites--indeed, many
people across the rest of the state--as a dangerous urban no-go area.

Now the floods were pushing tens of thousands of those inner-city residents
deep into Baton Rouge and beyond. The TV pictures showed vast throngs of black
people who had been trapped in downtown New Orleans disgorging out of rescue
trucks and helicopters to be ushered onto buses headed west on Interstate
Highway 10. The nervousness among many of the white evacuees in my hotel was
palpable.

Few stopped to contemplate that the reason nearly all the people shown on TV
were black was because that's who was left behind when the better-off New
Orleans residents with the money and means to escape evacuated the city in
advance
of the storm.

Nor did they seem to notice that most of the refugees were bedraggled mothers
and exhausted fathers and frightened children and ailing old
people--ordinary, law-abiding citizens who had had little to begin with and
escaped with
absolutely nothing except the clothes on their backs and their lives.

And it wasn't just the uninformed, the idle and the bigoted spreading the
poison with loaded language.

Baton Rouge Mayor-President Kip Holden, himself an African-American, blamed
the state for sending "New Orleans thugs" to be sheltered in Baton Rouge and
promptly slapped a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the main River Center shelter, which
held 5,000 refugees from the storm.

"We do not want to inherit the looting and all the other foolishness that
went on in New Orleans," Holden was quoted as telling the Baton Rouge Advocate
in
Thursday's edition. "We do not want to inherit that breed that seeks to prey
on other people."

It was left to the Baton Rouge police chief to go on TV later in the day to
try to cool the growing hysteria and point out that a single knife had been
seized in the shelter. The mayor later said he had been misquoted by the
newspaper.

But the damage had been done. The doors to my hotel stayed locked.

The Red and the Green

A new play written by Kevin Killian and Karla Milosevich

We premiered the play in Portland last Friday as part of Bay Area Bazaar and
had a great time. The tip-top cast included many from the bay area who
travelled there, plus Jo Jackson, Chris Johanson and Matthew Stadler.

I hope you can come see the San Francisco performance of The Red and the
Green.

What are those red strings around the wrists of Madonna, Ashton Kutcher,
Stella McCartney, Annie Liebovitz and Stephen Hawking? In London's Kabbalah
Centre, a band of celebrities are gathering to celebrate their leader
Madonna's birthday. They are leading the hedonistic lifestyle their fame
guarantees them. Across the street, a rival band of celebrities wearing
green strings has taken up residence, determined to halt Kabbalah's
domination. The celebrities of the green party - Susan Sarandon, Betty Ford,
Lindsay Lohan, Ed Ruscha and San Francisco's own Matt Gonzalez and Barry
Bonds - believe in a strict program of social justice, economic
sustainability and sexual abstinence. Who is at the center of things? As
usual, famed theorist and cultural critic Susan Sontag, whose body in
afterlife becomes a contested site of two cults. Join us in celebrating
Madonna's 27th birthday, in London, where ordinary people from the USA try
to sound more British than the British - bloody posh, mate.

Starring: Gerald Corbin as Barry Bonds, Kota Ezawa as Ashton Kutcher, Zora
Ezawa as Lourdes (Madonna's daughter), Matt Flegle as Matt Gonzalez, Carla
Gaytan as Madonna, Craig Goodman as Will (from Will & Grace), Cliff Hengst
as Betty Ford, Scott Hewicker as Guy Ritchie, Tanya Hollis as Nicole Richie,
Kevin Killian as Susan Sontag, John Koch as Annie Liebovitz, Karla
Milosevich as Susan Sarandon, Tanya Milosevich as Stella McCartney, Laurie
Reid as Sandra Bernhard, Larry Rinder as Ed Ruscha, Jocelyn Saidenberg as
Lindsay Lohan, and Wayne Smith as Stephen Hawking.

"Courted controversy". That's an interesting way to put it. Is that like
saying Pat Robertson 'raised eyebrows' when he venomized in favour of
"taking out" the president of Venezuala?

ja?

Dear List,

In 1996, I left Texas to return to Minnesota, after having also lived
in Wisconsin and New York -- sixteen years later, an adult, or so
I believed, and why wouldn't I?  Except for working merely part-time
at good assistant jobs in college, I worked full-time, had supported
myself in full without the benefit of shared income and other amenities,
such as full salary, whilst in pursuit of a ten-year training that
would certainly bring in a real job again one day.  When I got here,
I learned that I was currently among the "homeless," though I lived
in a beautiful, secure wooded place called home.  I learned that I
had been homeless, because I had lived in apartments.  A good one
of those they had not heard of nor could they imagine really liking.
Further, I had probably charged for sex as a prostitute -- maybe
even been in porn -- as all of those who were not married and living
in cities probably had.  It took three, even four years, to find out
that they had thought all those things about me, generically.
I then wanted to retreat, without ever getting over my terrific Houston
garage apartment on its good block of Kipling -- or my loss in ability
to pay for it.  I had had no chance to correct the suburbans' misimpressions
because they had kept them hid or passed them only amongst one another.

Men bought meals eaten together.  Otherwise, we covered ourselves.
If both were meager on funds, chances are you ate alone -- however
you did that -- eating $20 takeout with the TV on or perhaps over a book
or magazine or by opening a can of soup.  Rarely did people even want
to eat together unless they were combined, either living together or hooked
up or thought to be getting involved, even in passing, worse, like here,
like the suburbs.  The suburban imagination goes wild in its open spaces,
leaps across country miles and rooftops -- travels by wish and telephone --
with dark tales of city life!

All of that reminds me of Barbara Bush's comment that the poor
of New Orleans are better off now camping 300 miles from home
in a sports arena than they were in their own city, houses, and apartments.
Only the very game and healthy would feel caught up as if in adventure
in their newly relocated positions.  As if all of Houston were rich
offering itself just ahead of them, lying at the feet of the poor!

AB

To all listies and friends:

Michael Kelleher will making an impromptu visit to our little city of Balti=
more next weekend, Friday September 16th to be exact.

We'll be first convening at my apartment then we'll be carrying on over to =
the Fine Arts Building on Towson University's campus.

We're thinking ten-ish (10 P.M.) so we don't run into trouble.

This is all tentative and depends upon my calculations - if the building ca=
n be entered and we can secure a private room. I'm sure this will not be a =
challenge.=20

If worse comes to worse we'll be hosting Michael at our abode.=20

Write for details, or if you have suggestions...

cheers,

Is Barbara Bush diverting media attention intentionally from other news of interest ... such as Halliburton's new contract?

THE NEO-GRIOT NEW ORLEANS PROJECT
â€œListen To The Peopleâ€

We will go to the shelters and far-flung communities where significant
numbers of exiled New Orleanians are now residing. We will collect their
storiesâ€”not simply their memories of escaping our flooded city, but also
a social profile of who they are, what their day to day lives were, what
were their hopes and dreams, their challenges and struggles.

Too often when major historic events take place, those who are live at
the margins of the mainstream are ignored. We know what the presidents
and generals did, we know what the business leaders and major cultural
figures thought, but do we know anything about the poor, the
disenfranchised, the people of the Dome, the overpass, as well as those
who left the city on Sunday and as of Tuesday night had no city to
return to?

During the Great Depression the WPA collected the stories of people who
had experienced slavery. Today we will collect the stories of people who
survived a defining moment in American and World History.

We are neo-griots. Griot refers to the traditional West African
historians/story-tellers/musicians. Neo refers to digital technology.
Our goal is to write, to record, to photograph and video the stories of
survival, and to share these stories with the world via the internet.

The project will be led by Kalama ya Salaam, a New Orleans native,
internationally recognized as a cultural historian and creative writer.
Among his many accomplishments, he was the Executive Director of the New
Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation from 1983 to 1987, and was serving as
the co-director of Students at the Center, a creative writing program in
the New Orleans public schools. Salaam taught writing and digital video.
As the editor of the Black Collegian magazine (1970 - 1983) Salaam
published over a hundred interviews. He was also a member of the Free
Southern Theatre, which toured the deep south. For the last ten years,
Salaam has been leading the Neo-Griot Workshop, a weekly gathering of
New Orleans writers of color.

In 1998 Salaam founded E-Drum, a daily listserv built around the
interests of Black writers and diverse supporters of Black literature
worldwide. In June of 2005, Salaam and his son, Mtume ya Salaam, began
Breath of Life (kalamu.com/bol), a website conversation about Black music.

Salaam is uniquely prepared to lead this project. Moreover, he has
identified New Orleans writers and artists who are prepared to enter the
field and interface with the thousands of New Orleanians in exile.

The objective is:

1. to put the words and images of the people on the internet via a New
Orleans Project website.

2. to teach the respondents how to access the internet, so that they can
continue sharing their views after the neo-griots leave.

3. to archive the resulting information so that it can be researched and
accessed worldwide.

We invite your support of our project.

t audio levels and filter out some of the unwanted noise - for the most p=
art it's all pretty clear, but you will ocassionaly find yourself trying =
to listen to Prof. Davis over some strange whirring noises. But I promise=
 you it's well worth it.

As a boy three years old, behung already with a Saturnalian sadness
(because the first things I remember were physical fights between my mom
and already-gone dad), I took solace in the old bronze boxed black & white
Sylvania television my mom owned. This was Moorhead, Minnesota, 1969, 304
N. 11th Street. There were 6 kids and no dad. I was the only boy.

I recall the September day in 1969, barely 3, that I discovered my Self in
someone whom a fat man called the Skipper kept calling Gilligan. It was
Gilligan who was blamed for everything -- it was Gilligan who was blamed
for stranding the SS Minnow on an uncharted desert island. IT WAS NOT
GILLIGAN'S FAULT.

Bob Denver, age 70, is died.

When I would turn the TV off, by pushing in a plastic bronze-painted button
the shape of a golf tee, the field of light in the screen would sadly implode

into a dense thistle of light in the center of the screen. Bye bye I would
say. And it would drop away into a dark I did not understand.

Bye bye Mr Denver. Bye bye.

The situation is very bad.  The Federal Government has only just allowed
animal rescuers to go in.  They're finding animals trapped inside homes all over
the place, no food, no water for days now.

Eventually as criminally inept as the government has been, the humans will be
helped.  But there's no FEMA for the animals.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

=20
ONE=B9S OWN LANGUAGE: A WORKSHOP IN BASIC ELEMENTS =AD LISA JARNOT
TUESDAYS AT 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 11TH
=20
"Language is a fundamental amorous and poetic experience."-Robin Blaser. In
this literature seminar we'll look at the fundamental elements of language
that contribute to a poem.  Beginning with theories of linguistics, we will
study the building blocks- from phonemes and morphemes to the feet of the
line to the composition of the poem as a whole.  Our study of poetry will
focus around the mechanics of the craft- How do poets consciously (and
unconsciously) measure lines and music and rhythms and rhymes in poems?
What are the lineages that these senses of craft evolve out of?  How do
poets in different cultures approach the formal considerations of their
craft?=B2  Lisa Jarnot is the author of three full-length collections of
poetry including Black Dog Songs (Flood Editions).
=20
=20
VERSIONS:  WRITING OUR ENTHUSIASMS =AD NADA GORDON
THURSDAYS at 7 PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 20TH
=20
=B3In this conclave you will investigate techniques to help you attain
**maximally energized** writing and write exactly what you need to read.
We=B9ll approach verse as versions (as in rewrites or cover tunes),
animadversions (=8Cstrong criticisms=B2 of prevailing orders), subversions,
controversy, perversions (including the violent sexiness of semantic &
grammatical friction), reversions (examining and borrowing from really old
sources), obversions (turns and alterations), aversions (=B3the poetics of
disgust=B2), introversions (amniotic or private language, hypnosis),
conversions (of our enthusiasms and obsessions into verbal artifacts),
diversions (in the form of frivolous poetry =B3parlor games=B2), diversity (wit=
h
special attention to =B3other=B2 cultures), vertigo, conversions
(collaborations) and even quaquaversions: =B3a dome-like dipping in all
directions.=B2 The reading list will be determined by conversation.
Participants will:  explore and articulate their poetic assumptions, share
inspirations (including those outside of literature), learn to develop a
=B3magpie poetics=B2, write at least one piece collaboratively, and enhance at
least one poem with music, costume, props, or movement for performance
(extroversion!).=B2 Nada Gordon is the author of four books, including V. Imp=
.
and, with Gary Sullivan, Swoon.
=20
=20
PARANORMAL POETRY =AD SIMON PETTET
FRIDAYS AT 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 14TH
=20
=B3Taking some of the fundamental distinctions from the great "Freddie" Myers
and his epic Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903) -
outdated but still useful - we will examine: =B3Disintegration of
Personality,=B2 =B3Genius,=B2 =B3Sleep,=B2 =B3Hypnotism,=B2 =B3Sensory Automatism,=B2
=B3Phantasms of the Dead,=B2 =B3Motor Automatism,=B2 =B3Trance,=B2 =B3Possession,=B2 and
=B3Ecstasy.=B2 As well as =B3Inspiration,=B2 =B3Invocation,=B2 =B3Altered States of
Consciousness,=B2 =B3Visionary Experience,=B2 =B3Ghosts and Hauntings,=B2 "Dreams,=B2
etc.  =B3If you wish to understand the invisible=B2, goes the old Talmudic
saying, =B3look carefully at the visible.=B2 We shall search out and propose
poems and poets from around the world that act with particular magic as
agents/instances of that invisible. We will examine, from several
perspectives, in several ways, the poet as "paranormal" (sic), as medium an=
d
shaman. The workshop will comprise one stage in the compilation of an
anthology. Students are encouraged to bring their own knowledge and
enthusiasm and be willing to research and stumble (serendipitously) on
relevant texts.=B2 Simon Pettet is the long-time Film Archivist at the
Parapsychology Foundation, and the author of Selected Poems and, most
recently, More Winnowed Fragments, (both from Talisman).
=20
=20
HYBRID POETRY =AD DREW GARDNER
FRIDAYS at 7 PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN NOVEMBER 18TH
=20
In this workshop, we will experiment with fusing separate genres of writing
into poetic hybrids. Students will work using different elements of fiction=
,
drama, memoir, and nonfiction mixed and recombined within the genre of
poetry, exploring poetry as an inclusive, speculative catalyst for producin=
g
writing that crosses lines. We will do readings of poetic line-crossers,
including Kamau Brathwaite, Bernadette Mayer, Charles Olson, Sei Shonagon,
Alan Davies, Novalis, Jalal Toufic, Basho, and Kathy Acker as well as poeti=
c
writings that are not normally thought of as poetry, such as Emerson's
essays, the letters of Emily Dickinson and Krazy Kat Comic strips. We will
also look at questions of structure, content and effect in poetry from the
perspective of other art forms, especially music and filmmaking, and from
the perspective of other disciplines, especially natural science and
psychology. Drew Gardner is the author of Sugar Pill. His new book,
Petroleum Hat, is forthcoming from Roof Books.
=20
=20

AN EDUCATED HEART
by Mairead Byrne

In juxtaposing poem sequences respective to the 2003 invasion of Iraq =
and the breakdown of a family, AN EDUCATED HEART raises again the =
troublesome question of the relationship between the public and the =
private, in the specific context of a woman's voice.  While the two =
sequences are clearly delineated, the collection also includes poems =
which could refer to family life, or war, or both.  The poems relating =
to Iraq are by and large composed of fragments of Internet coverage of =
the war, and an aesthetic of collage, fragmentation, and brokenness =
pervades the book.

Mairead Byrne immigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1994 for =
reasons of poetry. Her collection NELSON & THE HURUBURU BIRD was =
published in 2003 by Wild Honey Press. She lives with her two daughters =
in Providence, Rhode Island, where she teaches poetry at Rhode Island =
School of Design.

    The situation in New Orleans is, as we all know, unspeakable. I wrote something about it and put it on my blog. Then I guessed that other poets were writing about it too. I want to start a collection of elegaic poems, prose pieces, etc., on my blog. I want to give people the impetus to create even as we witness destruction. If you are interested in contributing to this collection, you can e-mail me (afieled@yahoo.com), or call me (610) 608-2094 (and I will answer). In the face of the horrible, it won't be much, but it'll at least be something.
    Many Thanks,

Hi.  If you've done street activism as a poet, particularly around the wars and anti-Bush stuff (in NYC, for example, poets have formed groups such as Debunker Mentality, Poets for Peace, Acts of Art, etc.), I'd like to interview you for an article for the new journal, PRACTICE.  My deadline's mid-September, so please back-channel me soon.

Thanks much, Betsy

What are those red strings around the wrists of Madonna, Ashton Kutcher,
Stella McCartney, Annie Leibovitz and Stephen Hawking?  In London?s Kabbalah
Center, a band of celebrities meets to worship and to lead the hedonistic
lifestyle their fame guarantees them.  They give their children kooky
names?Rumour, Scout, Tallulah, Gwyneth, Apple and Rocco.  It?s all good.  Only
one problem?across the street a rival band of celebrities wearing green
strings has taken up residence, determined to halt Kabbalah?s domination.  The
celebrities of the Green Party?Susan Sarandon, Betty Ford, Lindsay Lohan, Ed
Ruscha, and San Francisco?s own Barry Bonds and Matt Gonzalez?believe in a
strict program of social justice, economic sustainability and sexual
abstinence.  And naming your children ordinary names like Tom and Michael and
Cathy.  It?s the war of the worlds all right, and who?s at the center of
things, as usual, famed theorist and cultural critic Susan Sontag, whose body
in afterlife becomes a contested site of two major religions.  Among others,
The Red and the Green stars Cliff Hengst as Betty Ford, Tanya Hollis as Nicole
Richie, Scott Hewicker as Guy Ritchie, Gerald Corbin as Barry Bonds, Rex Ray
as Ed Ruscha, Laurie Reid as Sandra Bernhard, Tanya Milosevich as Stella
McCartney, Wayne Smith as Stephen Hawking, Kota Ezawa as Ashton Kutcher,
Jocelyn Saidenberg as Lindsay Lohan, John Koch as Annie Leibovitz, and Craig
Goodman as Will, Will from Will and Grace.  Join us in celebrating Madonna?s
27th birthday, in London, where ordinary people from the USA try to sound more
British than the British?bloody posh, mate.

A Direct Response to Support Black Community Relief and Rebuilding in
Louisiana/Mississippi/Alabama

Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund at the Twenty-First Century Foundation

The mission of the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund is to provide
targeted support to rebuild the lives of displaced low income people
impacted by Hurricane Katrina.  The fund will provide strategic
grants for relief, recovery, and advocacy efforts that promote long
term equitable solutions. To donate, see the Foundation's website
at  <http://www.21cf.org/>

The Twenty-First Century Foundation is a national public foundation
created to promote strategic philanthropy by the African
American/Black community. For more than 35 years, the Foundation has
been a community builder, fostering cooperation and connection
between Black donors, grantees, and leaders.

The Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund of the Twenty-First Century
Foundation will partner with organizations in the region to ensure
that resources get to the people who need them most, and achieve the
justice goals at the heart of this initiative.  The Fund will focus
on the strategic issues that lead to the enfranchisement of the victims.

Charles Sheffield, Chairman of the Twenty-First Century Foundation
Board said "In New Orleans, we are witnessing a tragedy.  A city has
been destroyed.  Black people are disproportionately affected...But
who is looking out for the Black folk who have lost everything?  Who
knows how to advocate for our people?  Who knows how to fund the
organizations that will apply the necessary resources to uplift Black
people?  The individual citizen can make a difference."

Contributions to the Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund will pool
individual gifts and target resources to provide direct assistance
while investing in the civil rights and economic empowerment of Black
communities in the region.  The Twenty-First Century Foundation is a
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  All donations are tax-deductible.

I really appreciate this statement on the WRITERS FORUM site. I'd like
to see these thought be more wide spread.  I can't imagine how many
submissions I've received over the last 25 years where the person
submitting didn't have a clue:

"We strongly recommend that you familiarise yourself with the kind of
work published by a press, any press, large or small, commercial or
not, before you submit work to it. That is, buy their publications.
(Use the money you are going to save on postage by not wasting
submissions.) You will almost certainly discover some new work which
interests and perhaps pleases you; and you will have provided the press
with new customers, and its authors with new readers."

I've a question, and as I understand many of us are,
perhaps, sensitive to criticism, as I'm, certainly,
please feel free to e-mail me directly (if necessary).

But what's the feeling about e-books? I've published a
chapbook in the past, appreciate the idea of carrying
around well-weathered books and am uncertain as to
what I think about e-books, regardless of their
democratic, let me say, mode of exchange.

Your time will be appreciated.

Contrary to your interest in this actor for Gilligan's Island, what I remember him for most was the role of Maynard G. Krebs in the Dobie Gillis show.  He was the first Beatnik I ever saw, even though I was growing up in the midst of Greenwich Village.  Although Ginsberg apparently objected to the caricature, at the time (I was in my early teens or late preteens) I found the character utterly winning and attractive.  Small children are so easily moved.  But, since I followed the counterculture route years later as a so-called adult, I may have Maynard and the actor who impersonated him partly to thank for this.

This type of statement is, in fact, on most eZine sites somewhere, and
in most print journals, and even in places like the POETS *MARKET* and
WRITERS MARKET.  If I have time after repairing a wall, I will comment
about the idea of submissions as marketing.

There are several reasons, aside from writers early in the submitting
writing process not buying a copy, that these statements don't work.
One is that beginning editors rarely can tell you what they want to or
will publish -- they are waiting for it to flow over the transom -- and
so their journals are hardly models of consistency.  Another is that
many of these statements include long lists of poets who are read and
understood very different ways, or mention vague things like "quality"
and that old Emily Dickinson saw about the top of her head.

With the short life of most journals, it means that most editors are
beginning editors or that the consistent, long-established journal is no
longer taking submissions not from friends or former contributors, or
that it will accept now for publication in three years.

There is a reason Lyn Lifshin and Janet I. Buck have published so many
poems.

The other is, of course, it is hard to tell coterie publishing when you
see it, or when you see it it is not possible to know if it is a club
that will have you or not until you send a submission.  In general, it
can be more informative to see who is published rather than what, or to
read what never forgetting who.  A lot of time this gets shuffled under
"silly star system MFA verse approach" but there is more to it than
that.  For example, American writing and certainly publication
distribution is still regional, and although the MFA explosion and
creation of non-overlapping poetry "scenes" has countered that, it often
hasn't done it in work-centered ways.

Paradoxically while many writers new to submitting claim to want
comments on their work, many want a more distant relationship with
editors, or want to be published in "big markets" and thus gravitate
towards editors who don't know whether they read a copy standing at a
newsstand, in the library, or surfing excerpts online, or have purchased
a copy or subscribed.

It is hard to reverse engineer some sort of editorial policy or poetic
from the majority of journals. And why should poets be in the line of
trying to mind read or psych out editors?  How often does every printed
work jibe with an editorial statement? How often does my favorite poem
in an issue of a journal share something in common with my submission,
in my view, and not in the editors' views?  How often does the Pushcart
Prize anthology, supposedly the editors' favorite works, represent the
most interesting work published that year?

It is mostly easier to just send the submission after checking out the
journal and the editors and see if anybody likes it.  Submitting
nationally costs about a dollar.  One in twenty will like it, and twenty
journals cost about $200.

Repair of wall:  about $50 plus my labor for the concrete blocks,
mortar, stucco, and paint, but since it is illegal to repair it, I have
to do it.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Thank you!

Maynard G. Krebs preceded my reading Kerouac by about a year, so I consider
him an important factor in my becoming teenage beatnik in 1961, which
eventually led me to where I am today (herever that is). Thank you, Bob
Denver!

Save Kepler’s Mailing List and How to Help
Filed under: 	General 	Books 	Save Kepler's — Rick @ 5:59 am

Thank you to all who attended the rally yesterday and to those who could not
attend but were there in spirit. We mentioned writing in through this
website as one way to get on the mailing list for saving Kepler’s. Please
email us and say Hi if you would like to be on the list. The address for
those of you who don’t do email links is savekeplers@gmail.com. (If there
are specific ways in which you think you can help–expertise you think you
can offer–please note them in your email.) If you have previously emailed in
through this site, you are already on our list. We will keep you informed of
any developments in the effort to save Kepler’s.

As noted at the rally, if and when Kepler’s returns, there will likely be
some sort of membership option available. The benefits of membership will be
good and are not to be missed. In the meantime, while we work to restore the
store, one thing you can do—in addition to getting on our mailing list and
buying local—is to urge the Tan Group, to come to favorable terms with
Kepler’s on its lease. Crack your knuckles and start writing letters. Even a
brief message to the group in support of Kepler’s would be helpful. Contact
info for the Tan Group: Tan Group: 3630 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA 94306,
650.493.6500. They used to have a website, but it curiously went down last
week. We persist in wondering why.

We are looking for Qualified Investors who are capable of making very large
contributions to the effort to revive Kepler’s. If you are interested and
think you fit the bill, please email us.

the musicians and artists of New Orleans rebuild their lives.

I'm a plagiarist at heart.
The foundation of my poetics is plagiarism.
I've stolen from an amalgam of sources.
I've even stolen from your sources.
You could say my poetics is corporate in nature.
My revisions are pink slips.
This is not a lie.
Although lying is my game.
(I never cite my references.)

I'm objective in all manner of writing-
that is, in poetry, in my poetry,
I'm objective in all senses of the word.
I don't believe an I-centered poetry
will change the world. I don't think this
is currently possible. I'm not about
the subjective, and line breaks they
just confound the matter. I wish I could
just write my poetry how I want.

Dear Friends of Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com:

I am sending this note out to you all to express a deep thanks to Jennifer K
Dick who this month has assembled for us
a Global Profile on the nation France and its poetry.

Jennifer approached CPMP early this year to do the section and she has done
a fabulous job. The section which will be up early next week includes
poetry, interviews and translations by some of France's best and most
interesting poets translated by some great translators including Laura
Mullen, Cole Swensen, Donna Stonecipher, Michelle Noteboom And many others.


The main reason for this note was to inform our mailing list and to also
invite from our readers comments and also to invite our readers to use our
site with your students if you have any that are interested in French
poetry. I also want to invite any of our readers to submit to our site any
other links to articles or French translations that you would want to
publicize via the section and also to links to buy books as well.

I hope that Autumn/Spring is going well for all and I would also urge all of
you to give to the Red Cross at www.americanredcross.org for hurricane
relief.

Regards

Raymond L Bianchi

There is an error in the url given below for The Twenty-First Century
Foundation. The first url will take you to the 'cystic fibrosis foundation.'
A good place bit not the site you are probably seeking.The second, which I
also paste here is the correct url for The Twenty-First Century Foundation,
http://www.21cf.org/. The two urls are very similar only a 'dot' between
'21' and 'cf." distinguishing them (or the absence of a 'dot.'. I encourage
you to support The Twenty-First Century Foundation, http://www.21cf.org/.

    They droveby,  in the night, passed a c company of homies forming
[X]'s all in a line;  jakes bent over twn the legs slapping their
balls.  A car ahead of Pallo, heading off toward Saanich,  hit a squirl
trying to make his way across Us. It got clipt bad. It kinda affected
Fuchx.
    -Aow-
    -It's a goner, peewee-
It jumpt roun in pain - flippin and twichin. Pallo tried his best to
kill it off under his wheel.
    -I think I hit it...-
But it kept jumpin and twistin in pain.
    -Lé dang, I missed it completely-
    -...dang...-
MILK and dIapAs
    -He got so much trouble on his mind.... D'ere your man, More, sport-
More was coming from the direction of his lil star's house. She just
live up in flat next to the George Jay. He'd dropped off some scrill for
the lil and his mum. [MILK and dIapAs] She on him for shit like that.
But, More he doesn't shrug all that off. More, he tries like woht is
tradition. He keeps their bellys full and all. He's got a free soul on
the shit. With the school all mashed he's got more time to hook up with
the dun. But woht poppy show, yuh kno....
    Pallo, pulls up beside More to let Fuchx out.
    -Sup, More-
    -What the crack, Pallo-
    -Sup, puppy-
    -Daps, aniki-
    -Sweet-
    -peace out pups; keep steady and Fuchx...
    -...ya...-
-...I'll send you a kite soon....stay up habibi, peace-
    -peace-
And Pallo smooths off in his dip ride banging Al Green: demanding love
and happiness shanking the glass btwn frames all along Cook.

I wanna go to the beach when it's got the moon. And peep my Sun. I wanna
cum as it rises. All by myself.

    -MILK and dIapAs, aniki. Had to get milk and diapas-
    -You got some scrill, huh-
    -G'¡Ya!-
    -I coulda gotten you some scrill for your ma and star, sport-
    -G'¡Ya!, well...-
    -We coulda. You and me. You know woht....¡YA!-
Fuchx pulled More's coat bout the brothas Esquire just cross the street
- over at the corner of Bay.
    -That's Tre and Ardbop, ri?-
    -Ayo, More, let's bumrush those punks, ¡Ya! yo they're diliquent-
    -Flex, spar-
    It was Bruthas Phatbak. They are known as Sugah Ardbop and King Tim
Tre, Esqs. They can be a interpreted as being a couple of burks -- real
knuckleheads. Wahl, that's woht's said bout them in the Hood. Ardbop,
like Wiggy, he's a real roid sot. He a hella gag, naw and he's becoming
quite a case like Wiggy, too -- wahl, that's woht's said. So he's a
scrapper champion but his art is in being a gearass nuff ruff selector.
He gave his Brutha his name. He's the one that named him King Tim Tre.
Tre, he's his bruh fa truth, bruh. He was a lil short fella woht was
decking in red nylon baggy track pants,  red long brim ballcap and a
tight red t-shirt woht read "take a photo crack".  Tre, though, he's
just a mark. The lil kids laugh at him in Ferny, Hillside and all of
E-Town and that's his hood, ya. But if somethin happen to him he just
sit and cry or go run to his bruh for assistance.
    But his bruh would never let any physical harm come to him. His bruh
Ardbop, it almost like he give birth to him. Like he was his daddy.
Like he was his homie...and they walk like... We guess, and even the
homies figure, that he had to keep his love safe from any bullshit that
may step to King Tre. Tre's a King though cuz he a sheisty muddafookca.
He the best at pulling a stunt,  sah -
Mistah Ganc and Scheme. King Tim, he got Ardbop laced up inna daye with
the pimpest vines so his big bruh could look super sharp for the his
school dance. Nadabody was going to get in his way when he was fixed on
gankin. He jackt an entire suit, silk tee, chain and fineass kicks for
his bruh,  sah. That nega was focused.
    The Esquires kept walking down Bay and Fuchxmo kept flexing some
serious,
    -Ayo, Tre!!! Bop!!!! ayo!!!! You best be going to the bank,  sa-
    -Ayo, naga!!! ayo!!!!
    -Woh/who, sa-
    They leg it cross to the otherside. This Vic, naw. Real close to
Blanshard. Just at the neutral, though. Fuchxmo cross over me. As they
come up on the homeys, they see clear, that the Bruthas was certain is
was bout the dank. That 8th. The 8th, which Fuchx scammed from Pallo
when warn't looking. They never paid for the 8th. Pallo knew but he say
nothing. The 8th. The front on word. Wohts word, yo? orgullo, yuh kno --
is bond and all that ol school shit. Fuchx was going pay Pallo back with
lil gifts and shit for the 8th. The 8th. They was dora for shu, them
Bruthas. They was owing already to Fuchxmo.  Fuchxmo owing to Pallo.
MILK and dIapAs
    -Where's my dun for the dank I fronted you you lil bitch-
    -Woh-
    -Woht, Wohwhoh? The dun, shudo. Where it at-
    -...and my  BallZ vid...-
    -...and my homey's DragonBall Z vid. You pinche lil feg-
    -...Woht are you doin bangin weed,  nekgah? We wonts our scrilla,
you lil bitch-
Says Tre,
    -I dunno, woh-
More succ e teet to that then says Fuchx,
-Lé lé lé, woht the foock do you mean 'I dunno'... I'm standing on my
truth. Where are you-
-...clots'square dancing, boufalé-
Says Tre,
    -We tried hookin up with you to getcha back but you warnt there, yo-
Says More to Fuchx,
    -They saw their duty and they done it-
Says Fuchx,
    -No bother tryin any other options, HUH? bouge de la, bwoy-
Says Tre,
    -Ayite, how's this -- I got robbed!! haha-
For some reason, Brutha Ardbop got a laugh out of Brutha King Tim's
jokes. He was as shiesty and insane as The Joker. But woht that make
Ardbop? Harly with muscle and a big ol lana?
Says Tre,
-Lé, naw, I'll tell you the truth -- I tried. I really tried gettin the
dun back to you. Choice dank, though dudes, alrato-
    Most/some here are prone to random acts of disloyality. They would
never raise their swords like a bwoy on Purim-- snap heads that burst
like crackers on the cover of that Gza joint. Hear the brewing beat of
32 hearts on the corner defending their block. Orgullo it's nada, naw.
It's just flexing and beat downs and jackin each one for wohteva. Fuchx,
he try to keep the ol school ways. Which is why he was looking on living
po P/V, cuz. Most/some act the mack and strut throwning back 40 ponders
and ozs all up and down ; hollerin out of car windows obsinities,
rocking whatever  shit and kicks they scammed with tire biting bettys.
And when here comes the warders/ priscillas come to haul their sorry
asses in, all they can do is grass to transform and walk clean/clean.
    -...ya bye/bye black bird, HAHA-
Ast Fuchx,
    -You high hattin us, feggit-
    Nada honour. Carlto said that their ain't no more gangstas. Just
alot punks ripping each other off. That's the way, naw.
Says More,
    -Woht the fookc to do you mean bye/bye-
    -...black bird...-
Says, Fuchx,
    -ya, black bird what the fookc ever, feggit -- You cyan fake the
funk, feggit-
    It all starts with a word and that word is used to unpretty and
sentence and make it a device of lies. It's all to soothe the boredom
and see where it ends up. But how it ends up it most time is like a set
trip that gets a body bruised, heads crushed, spirits damaged, sends
brown bodies into the muddy bottoms of the Gorge. ...Would you throw
this body of death away from Victoria... is what the humans say about
all this. You never know where it starts. It just maybe about something
triflin and then a loc(a) (s) just figures they'll do someone a payback.
Here they get other folk to do their dirty work.  It's all done through
lies a story -
the seeking of rank and whitebwais  prosperity.

Says Tre,
    -Fuk the funk-
    -Fookc the funk? ...why i aughta...-
-you paused-
-Did he just repeat a word-
-Gawd made me funky-
-...ah be a good boy and daddy'll get you a nice milké treat-
Ardbop rubs Fuchx' head.
-Why yuh pinche...-
    The warders know most of this shit going to go down but they're too
busy watching each one do their jobs for them.  Just drop a few sots
into the mix and all the shit just keeps getting invoked.  So the
priscillas just sit back and clean up all the carnals lost to the big
bored fib.
            ...drivers and witnesses...

Here come Pallo rolling up in on all this bodderation and bangerang
stuff nonsense trash in his matblack ugly car. Out comes -- him and the
dread dreaded I Hona fix to aggrovate a harder version on this gow. The
sounds of King Tubby can be heard -- Marcus Dub rattatatat!!!!


Says More,
    -Holdup, you lil bitch. You ain't gon nowhere-
Says Fuchx,
    -Golly, woht? you on crack, nekgah-
    That thing. It's that woht a busta be and look like. It's folk who
believe everythang they told. Hate pon those assumptions. Then just
disrespect and respect all the wrong folk. Then act like they kno wohts
goin down and all roun = busta.
                        [Who wanna be down]
    Those G'z. hustlaz and hoz have lost all their focus and they become
thugz [ettez]. ...was the runners who made the mistake.... They become
greta. They spend more and more time trying to impress one another. Gag
Thugz jammin roids, hollarin, shoutin, screamin, fightin, cussin = Much

all my life i've been weird

weirdness, a commendable characteristic or not? ever since i saw bob =
denver
as the inimitable 'beat' character maynard g crebbs in the tv show 'the =
many
loves of dobie gillis', i have been a fan of weird. a strange =
introduction
to the world of the alternative lifestyle, to bohemia and beyond. =
maynard
was a hip cat, a beatnik, a person who did not follow the conservative
middle class values of his best friends dobie or zelda and whose =
dirtiest
four letter word was 'work' and only true love was jazz. in retrospect =
he
was a pretty funny stereotypical television comic character constructed =
by
some astute script writing team. but when i was 12 and unaware of =
writers
and the business of television production, and only saw the characters =
on tv
as representiing real life, maynard spoke to me as if he were real. he =
was
saying to me 'come and join our team, we need more weirdos', and i =
followed
the bongo drums and the improvised poetic outbursts and the coolness of
maynard.

in my early years of high school i sewed black wool onto a great aunt's =
felt
beret and wore it as a wig, so that i could look like one of the beatles =
-
pretty weird when i look back on it. but not as weird as the cardboard
stick-on side levers made from my head hair glued to the cardboard. i =
hadn't
started shaving and desperately wanted facial hair as was the emerging =
hippy
fashion of the 1960s. the kids at school admired my efforts, it was an =
era
when young people started to have an identity, to demand to be heard and
seen, but the teachers thought i was weird.

my parents, of the big fat greek wedding type, hard working people who =
had a
fish and chip shop and high aspirations for their children to be
'something', they definitely thought i was weird. my mother wanted to =
take
me to a psychiatrist when i tie-dyed a pair of new blue denim jeans. she
just could not understand how a sane person could ruin a brand new pair =
of
jeans on purpose. and my father, well he never could understand why i =
was
air-guitaring in the greek church whilst the service was still on. it =
might
have been the incense but i don't know why suddenly i thought i was jimi
hendrix. i knew i wanted to be one of those long haired weirdos.

designing and making my own clothes, teasing my hair out into an afro,
organising discos at the local church hall were all part of my teenage
weirdness, but the most awesome of teenage experiences was being taken =
to
'the outpost inn'. here bearded folk singers with acoustic guitars and
sloppy woollen jumpers and jeans would sing their songs of protest and
social comment in a dark basement lit by candles. we sat on wooden =
outdoor
furniture and used clay saucers for ashtrays and drank coffee from =
coffee
mugs, not tea in teacups as i had been accustomed all my life. this was =
the
heart of bohemia, right in the middle of my city, why didn't someone =
tell me
of this earlier? but still i felt like an outsider to this, a visitor =
but
not a resident weirdo. i experienced the blues too, and i mean the =
acoustic
blues on vinyl, early recordings of huddy leadbetter, robert johnson, =
and
big bill broonzy,  leadbelly, the thought of a man chained to a piano
singing out his emotions, the songs of pimps, police and prostitutes,
whiskey bars, wooden tables and chairs, dark smoky environments, the
underworld, the underside of society. this world was so far from my
double-fronted three-bedroom cream-brick manicured-lawn with a ford in =
the
driveway and Frigidaire in the kitchen and a television set advertising
coca-cola and the Marlboro man.

at university the label long-haired radical unemployed/bludging =
dope-smoking
hippy shit weirdo was one i was wanting to adopt but never quite felt i =
was
a genuine citizen of bohemia, more a fellow traveller or weekend weirdo. =
the
commitment to getting an education, to being something, for those hard
working migrant parents, kept me on the fairly straight path and stopped =
me
from wandering into the land of the weird. the straight path led to a =
big
fat greek marriage and preparation for a big fat greek family, job,
mortgage, and the things that were definitely not weird. but still, in =
my
mid twenties i was searching for the weird, and as all my friends =
dressed in
white suits and danced like john travolta in saturday night fever i was
discovering a generation of musicians in greece, in the early 1900s, =
that
were very similar to the old black blues singers i was also listening =
to.
the rembetes were singing about their tormented lives just like the =
blues
singers with many parallels. this was a huge revelation to me. i was =
always
under the impression that you had to be black or from the usa or from =
the uk
to be weird, but now i discovered there was a greek weirdness also. my
parents had always used the cultural argument of 'greeks don't do that', =
for
nearly every kind of weirdness i displayed. but now there was hope,
weirdness was universal in every culture.

i left my wife, my big fat greek family and my jobs as =
microbiologist/youth
worker/travel agent to open a dimly lit, smoky, music cafe, 'tsakpina'. =
the
cafe had large life size photos of greek musicians, male and female, =
playing
instruments or sitting at tables in clubs. they looked down at you from =
the
walls, as if inviting you into their world. and with wooden boxes as =
tables
and cushions as chairs, and playing the music of the rembetes, and
recreating an atmosphere of a 1920s athenian hash den the cafe was my =
weird
bohemian haven. and it attracted weird bohemian radical interesting =
talented
customers; poets; musicians; actors; comedians; political activists;
homeless; misfits and what society calls the weirdos. poets started =
having
poetry readings there, acoustic musicians gave recitals, feminists held
women's only nights, and sometimes spontaneous jam sessions lasted until
sunrise. this is were i first started writing poetry and first read a =
poem
at a reading, not really performing at that stage. i was copying maynard
without realising it and within a completely different cultural context. =
but
all fairytales have to end and the bohemian cafe i constructed to exist =
in
as a weirdo, had to close.

the friends i made at the cafe led me to be introduced to whole circuits =
of
small smoky dimly lit cafes where poetry readings were plentiful and =
poets
spoke of life and living on the other side of white male middle class
australian society. i was sufficiently weird by this stage to consider =
that
my career from this point on would be one of poet and that my life's =
work
would be devoted to words, sort of like maynard and jazz. i earnt my =
living
as a performance poet for ten years with the simple belief that it could =
be
done. there is a bohemia and it has no national borders, it exists in =
every
country, in every big city, and sometimes in small towns. and its =
citizens
know how to find it. i have found it in london, in paris, in athens, in
buffalo, in providence, in new york, in melbourne, in sydney, in =
singapore,
in every city and country i have visited. that is why, when i now find
bohemia online and read with envy the list of local toronto events that =
seem
to ooze weirdness, i want to participate and visit, even by internet.

i remarried (and re-divorced) and now have two great children, 17 and =
15. i
asked my son if he knew anyone that was weird. he named me, his mother =
and
his sister. i asked him if he thought it was good or bad to be weird. he
said it was good, in fact he said weirdness makes the world go round. =
when
the kids went to school i stopped touring as a performance poet and =
started
to teach at university. i would like to teach a bachelor of weirdness =
but
i'm afraid that might be too much for the university system to handle so =
i
haven't ever suggested it. but i might.=20

when people come to my home now, they say it is weird, and i thank them. =
the
photos, posters, mirrors, carpets, shawls, shoes, sketches and paintings
that hang from the walls thank them also. when students say i'm weird i
smile. when students say they like me because i'm weird i hope they are =
on
their own journey and to find that they are comfortable with the title =
also.
anyway i'm sure maynard g crebbes would be proud of me.

I recall once seeing Denver's character Maynard G. Krebs when I was a kid,
but I'd already imprinted on Denver as Gilligan -- and got physically sick
watching Krebs. Not because Krebs was weird but because I couldn't
understand how Gilligan had gotten back to the mainland, back to
civilization, and why he was sitting in a cafe acting so disaffected and
aloof. I couldn't understand what had happened to Gilligan. Where was his
good cheer and sailor hat? Had he taken a blow to the head?

 Bush Suspends Pay Act In Areas Hit by Storm

 By Thomas B. Edsall

  President Bush yesterday suspended application of the federal law governing
workers' pay on federal contracts in the Hurricane Katrina-damaged areas of
Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The action infuriated labor
leaders and their Democratic supporters in Congress, who said it will lower
wages and make it harder for union contractors to win bids.

 The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in 1931 during the Great Depression, sets a minimum
pay scale for workers on federal contracts by requiring contractors to pay the
prevailing or average pay in the region. Suspension of the act will allow
contractors to pay lower wages. Many Republicans have opposed Davis-Bacon,
charging that it amounts to a taxpayer subsidy to unions.

 In a letter to Congress, Bush said he has the power to suspend the law because
of the national emergency caused by the hurricane: "I have found that the
conditions caused by Hurricane Katrina constitute a 'national emergency.' "

 Bush wrote that his decision is justified because Davis-Bacon increases
construction costs, and suspension "will result in greater assistance to these
devastated communities and will permit the employment of thousands of
additional individuals."

 AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney denounced the Bush announcement as
"outrageous."

 "Employers are all too eager to exploit workers," he said. "This is no time to
make that easier. What a double tragedy it would be to allow the destruction of
Hurricane Katrina to depress living standards even further."

 Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce, accused Bush of "using the devastation of
Hurricane Katrina to cut the wages of people desperately trying to rebuild
their lives and their communities."

 Miller said: "In New Orleans, where a quarter of the city was poor, the
prevailing wage for construction labor is about $9 per hour, according to the
Department of Labor. In effect, President Bush is saying that people should be
paid less than $9 an hour to rebuild their communities."

Subject:      Literary Narcissism and the Manufacture of Scandal
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Ever since reading THE GREAT NAROPA POETRY WARS this summer, I have been
thinking about Allen Ginsberg's alcoholism -- and how that book clearly
shows that, though he would never fess up to it, Ginsberg was interested in
the purposeful manufacture of Outrage, the politics of scandal and what
might be called an Economy of Attention.  Does any of this seem familiar?
    * A Literary Narcissist's behavior will not only tolerate but encourage
attacks on himself so long as it can translate his own self-fascination
into more news of himself.
    * Just as the Narcissist will use argument, catastrophe, disputation to
attract attention, certain people will be willing to dispute the Narcissist
in order to participate in the economy of attention. Others will dispute
the Narcissist because they are so profoundly appalled by his/her behavior.
Either way, the economy of attention is fueled.
    * The Narcissist needs Catastrophe. The more internal crises of shame
the Narcissist endures and fails to heed, the more s/he will need to create
external Catastrophes. A chief and signal way a Narcissist might attract
attention is to start fights: Narcissists will gravitate toward satire and
caricature as a means of creating argument. The Narcissist will attempt to
construe strife with health: "These arguments need to happen," etc.
    * The Narcissist IS fascinating -- but not for the reasons the
Narcissist thinks. S/he is fascinating because the energy s/he will expend
in micromanaging the self image is so profoundly exceptional. People just
sort of stand there slack-jawed wondering if this person has a life. The
Narcissist however will mistranslate the fascination of others as admiration.
    * Poetry communities will tolerate narcissism so long as it is
translated into a Social Energy which others can use to strengthen and
promote their projects.
    * Narcissism and alcoholism. Alcoholism is a systematic way to push
down socially regulating emotions like shame, guilt, and embarrassment at
one's own self-aggrandizing behavior. The suppression of these emotions is
never successful, even in the most energetic of self-aggrandizers, and they
will periodically burst upward into brief displays of remorse and
convictions to change. These brief spouts of regulatory behavior are
sometimes shared publicly and sometimes privately among confidants. These
displays however can often easily be "re-used" by the Narcissist as a way
of showing his/her authenticity and emotional fealty to the community.
    * The Narcissist is aware of the economy of disgust surrounding his/her
behavior. S/he becomes more and more sensitive to this and consequently
begins to demand private declarations of loyalty from those people whom
s/he knows consider themselves friends -- even if they have said nothing
publicly against the Narcissist.
    * The Narcissist, aware of this disgust, will create a personal mythos
in which s/he will be justified and exonerated by the rewards of literary
"history." The stronger the disgust of others, the greater the energy used
to maintain the mythos of exoneration by history.
    * Narcissists are only interested in community so long as it pays
dividends to their energy: they will support it if it feeds them.
    * The narcissist may outright demand in private that you "pay" him
publicly with praise. Then he or she will publicly "repay" you with a
communal mention.
    * In their attempt to cause others to adopt their self-fascination,
Narcissists will become increasingly paranoiac, constantly searching the
environment and community for news of themselves, for fealty or disloyalty.
    * The Literary Narcissist begins purposefully to conflate criticism of
his social behavior into an indication of his/her literary worth. That is
to say, the Narcissist will try to show that the reason others despise or
are disgusted by him is in fact because he or she is a "Rebel," a true
Literary Revolutionist -- and that the statements of disgust others
publicly make at his behavior is merely an indication of (a) their
necessary denial of the work because they are threatened by it, or (b)
their jealousy of the work.
    * There comes a point -- and the point may come early -- where the
community thinks to itself "teapot" and the Narcissist still hears
"tempest." The truly insular narcissist (aka "the boor") will be met more
and more with shunning, ignoring and silence. This will wrest the
narcissist from his insularity -- such that he will begin another project
designed to create Genuine Interest instead of mere scandalous attention.
This project, like a new comet's head, will be followed by a long tail of
manufactured scandal so as to call attention to its presence in the
literary sky.

Dear Mary,

I didn't know Ginsberg was an alcoholic. Was he?
I thought he was a Buddhist.
But Buddhists can be alcoholics so who knows...
A narcissist?
I don't think Ginsberg was clinical.
I imagine a narcissist to be a bit of a sociopath.
Would a good narcissist be able to function well in society?
I have never seen a description of a Literary Narcissist (sp) before
If this is the first definition of one
I would be hard pressed to disagree wit it.
It might be totally original
If Ginsberg one of those things that Gabriel describes
I've never considered it.
But as far as getting attention by creating conflict,
I thought I could disagree like a good Literary Narcissist
and get you to buy my book.
Would you like to buy a copy, Mary?

Best,
MR

 the tenants of the caldwelll apts located at 2321 cook st that their bui=
lding had been condemned. the caldwell apts seems to be owned by robin ki=

As we have seen in the ever self vindicating need to add legitimacy to on=
es own life and flaws, to seek identity in a label and definition and in =
turn labeling and defining others as the oppostion/the enemy/the evil -- =
to recreate ourselves and reality and embed deeper into the avoidance iss=
ues of the increase sociopathic behavior of our civilazation, we have mad=
e out to be the peoples not fitting into the consumer dream of complete c=
onformity -- be it alternia or suburbia -- to match the failed standard o=
f our society -- who "litter" or =93loot=94 our gentrified streets, build=
ings and zones by daring to exist, to be seen, by daring to attempt to li=
ve, yet still not look nor think the part of the neourban/rural cool (the=
 trouble with our zones), as the reason for the lack of peace in our in d=
iscontented/disconnected world, therefore, deserving of injustice, their =
abuse and finally to get to robbed and disappeared.

With the tragedy of these poor folk and the blantant wrongful actions tak=
en against them =96 the theft of their funds, loss of their homes and no =
concern for their safety, as a result of the action of the =93good guys=94=
=96 the homemade (in)secruity with it's identity swipe cards of =91right =
like us=92 is threatend, therefore; our created world does not become as =
just as was promised by the dvd rentals, magazines, coffee talk bring com=
es and cyber ads. it is encouraged that we find our daemon and then use t=
he tool of capitalISMS or more greed -- the ever effective weapon of mass=
 devilment -- which is the daemoncractic metaphor of dispossessing =3D 'm=
ight makes right' to bully those we we feel we can.

the objects objectified for this targeting? the poor and those perceived =
alone in our world of frustration in this theatre of insantity.

and so on 07 sept yet again the drug dealers, junkies and nare do wells h=
ave been disappeared from our hood sent off to a redzone elsewhere and we=
 have our noble squire robin kimpton to thank for his community activism.=
 it would be media cool to think of these folk as the evils of the world =
=3D poor, addicted and insane (possibly muslim, homophobes, woman haters =
and socalists)-- and in this case white -- b.u.t. the reality of it is th=
ey are humans, and citizens of this hood some being students, workers, la=
bourers, and those considered more evil than a muslim =96 the poor. whate=
ver else one may be thinking of writing or chatting about these tenants o=
f the fallen caldwell apts it is best to consider this -- don't throw sto=
nes.

The hood is the heart -- Fernwood the place, b.u.t. new palestine is the =
state of mind. new palestine seeks justice-- new palestine is about fluid=
ity. new palestine only throws stones at the opressors of the fallout (th=
e suffers, the workers), for the cause of the righteous who are simply, a=
s james brown intoned to us to breath; doing the best they can,
doing the best they can
doing the best they can

for this is the hood inwhich these new palestinians lived -- like us all-=
- and it was a hood who had a city offer a "you're s.o.l." attitude and a=
ssistence as it allowed a slumlord like robin kimpton to clog hop off, as=
 if singing =93bye bye black bird=94, with the booty given to him by thos=
e very disposessed folk in his caldwell apts and the mega hella scrilla s=
ent to him by our less than communtiy orientated centre for the purchase =
of his other eyesore building located in the square of the hood of this f=
ernwood/new palestine.

=93The poorer sections of the working class, =85were abandoned to their f=
ate by the capitalist system and a corrupt political leadership on severa=
l levels. Those that survived were again abandoned when it took nearly fi=
ve days for relief efforts to begin,=85=94=97 Irish Republican Socialist =
Committees of North America -- =93Hurricane Katrina - A Question of Class=
=94

in the film =93the poseidon adventure=94 the ship is the metaphor for a w=
orld over turned and class is the issue as the people who must remember w=
here they came from inorder to survive. for they are trapped in first cla=
ss and drowning and they must make passage to the lower decks inorder to =
survive.

where is life?

in new palestine it is a thrash and roll of flow of all ages punk shows u=
napproved by the nabobs of conformity. It is revolution of the mental, tw=
o turntables or the burner out to build new indie cds for the local unsig=
ned hyperballadeers. It is dropping sciences on the spot. it is sharing f=
low like civil verbal clashes of sonic rhyme and metre in every season =96=
 it is standing up to bullies and legging it throw allies like resistence=
 fighters armed with weapons of thought and big spirits and not with guns=
 of destruction supplied by the disrupters of u.n.i.t.y.. new palestine i=
s running like mad men and women to help those were beaten on sidewalks f=
or the cause of good violence or left homeless and abondoned by the greed=
 of the slumlords and the siccophants who take over their dungeons and zo=
nes of tyranny.

in this era of might makes right over those poor and those perceived alon=
e -- you know, what people call drug dealers, junkies and such to be safe=
 in the good vs bad mental state -- we must think of the pornography of t=
his recent poppyshow of kimpton and the dis given to us by our communty c=
entre who chooses to show him love, for his years of racist renting polic=
ies, greed and the wicked gates he placed people in where they were raped=
, beaten, invaded, depressed, abondonded and abused.

=85and so maybe we can do the nyc thing or the l.a. la la land and san fr=
ancisco dot com deed and rebuild the caldwell into swanky overpriced flat=
s for the bigoted gaygouise, yups and their boppin kids what got credit. =
Wouldn=92t it be so groovey cuz they look so much better that what use to=
 live there =96 what we have buried in lies and who are now simply the ba=
d guys and I hear they were dang ugly.

=85b.u.t. in reality with our hearts in a place with our minds in tacked,=
 we must address and seek justice =96 proper compensation for those left =
with their rent, damage deposits, homes and dignity taken by a theif(ves)=
 given power in this messy era and taking too time at the mic.

Hold up!
=85reload

=85did I say diginity taken? No. I wrote that. Naw, this the place fernwo=
od -- the heart - the hood -- the mental state of struggle -- new palesti=
ne =96 ain=92t nadabody can take that away -- cuz we can deal with the re=
ality that evil exist in suits and ties and property rights for the neoco=
ol and their coopted media of mediocracity that life is mulitpulicity and=
 people are general as we pick each one up, wipe the blood of the streets=

Sorry Michael,

I'm saving up for Vern's Improvisations :-)



Dear Mary,

I didn't know Ginsberg was an alcoholic. Was he?
I thought he was a  Buddhist.
But Buddhists can be alcoholics so who knows...
A  narcissist?
I don't think Ginsberg was clinical.
I imagine a narcissist to  be a bit of a sociopath.
Would a good narcissist be able to function well in  society?
I have never seen a description of a Literary Narcissist (sp)  before
If this is the first definition of one
I would be hard pressed to  disagree wit it.
It might be totally original
If Ginsberg one of those  things that Gabriel describes
I've never considered it.
But as far as  getting attention by creating conflict,
I thought I could disagree like a  good Literary Narcissist
and get you to buy my book.
Would you like to buy  a copy, Mary?

Best,
MR

Firms with White House ties get Katrina contracts
FEMA taps Halliburton subsidiary, Shaw Group, Bechtel for cleanup

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Companies with ties to the Bush White House and
the former head of FEMA are clinching some of the administration's first
disaster relief and reconstruction contracts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Katrina.

At least two major corporate clients of lobbyist Joe Allbaugh, President
Bush's former campaign manager and a former head of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, have already been tapped to start recovery work along
the battered Gulf Coast.

One is Shaw Group Inc. and the other is Halliburton Co. subsidiary Kellogg
Brown and Root. Vice President Dick Cheney is a former head of
Halliburton.

Bechtel National Inc., a unit of San Francisco-based Bechtel Corp., has
also been selected by FEMA to provide short-term housing for people
displaced by the hurricane. Bush named Bechtel's CEO to his Export Council
and put the former CEO of Bechtel Energy in charge of the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation.

Experts say it has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic
administrations for policy makers to take lobbying jobs once they leave
office, and many of the same companies seeking contracts in the wake of
Hurricane Katrina have already received billions of dollars for work in
Iraq.

Halliburton alone has earned more than $9 billion. Pentagon audits
released by Democrats in June showed $1.03 billion in "questioned" costs
and $422 million in "unsupported" costs for Halliburton's work in Iraq.
Watchdog groups take notice

But the web of Bush administration connections is attracting renewed
attention from watchdog groups in the post-Katrina reconstruction rush.
Congress has already appropriated more than $60 billion in emergency
funding as a down payment on recovery efforts projected to cost well over
$100 billion.

"The government has got to stop stacking senior positions with people who
are repeatedly cashing in on the public trust in order to further private
commercial interests," said Danielle Brian, executive director of the
Project on Government Oversight.
Bush appointees at Halliburton

Allbaugh formally registered as a lobbyist for Halliburton subsidiary
Kellogg Brown and Root in February.

In lobbying disclosure forms filed with the Senate, Allbaugh said his goal
was to "educate the congressional and executive branch on defense,
disaster relief and homeland security issues affecting Kellogg Brown and
Root."

Melissa Norcross, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said Allbaugh has not, since
he was hired, "consulted on any specific contracts that the company is
considering pursuing, nor has he been tasked by the company with any
lobbying responsibilities."

Allbaugh is also a friend of Michael Brown, director of FEMA who was
removed as head of Katrina disaster relief and sent back to Washington
amid allegations he had padded his resume -- which he denies.

A few months after Allbaugh was hired by Halliburton, the company retained
another high-level Bush appointee, Kirk Van Tine.

Van Tine registered as a lobbyist for Halliburton six months after
resigning as deputy transportation secretary, a position he held from
December 2003 to December 2004.

On Friday, Kellogg Brown & Root received $29.8 million in Pentagon
contracts to begin rebuilding Navy bases in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Norcross said the work was covered under a contract that the company
negotiated before Allbaugh was hired.
Cheney's relationship with Halliburton

Halliburton continues to be a source of income for Cheney, who served as
its chief executive officer from 1995 until 2000 when he joined the
Republican ticket for the White House. According to tax filings released
in April, Cheney's income included $194,852 in deferred pay from the
company, which has also won billion-dollar government contracts in Iraq.

Cheney's office said the amount of deferred compensation is fixed and is
not affected by Halliburton's current economic performance or earnings.

Allbaugh's other major client, Baton Rouge-based Shaw Group, has updated
its Web site to say: "Hurricane Recovery Projects -- Apply Here!"

Shaw said on Thursday it has received a $100 million emergency FEMA
contract for housing management and construction. Shaw also clinched a
$100 million order on Friday from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Shaw Group spokesman Chris Sammons said Allbaugh was providing the company
with "general consulting on business matters," and would not say whether
he played a direct role in any of the Katrina deals. "We don't comment on
specific consulting activities," he said.

I'm pretty sure my high school psychology teacher would've flunked me if
I wrote an "analysis" like that, but that's OK, because the term
"narcissism" predates modern psychology by many moons. I like it as an
attempt at irony, though. It's Andy Kaufman for self-hating beat-geeks.
I also very much like "a bit of a sociopath." From now on, I declare
myself a little bit sociopathic. I a little bit have no empathy. I'm
still working on the specific applications, but I reckon I'll give you
$5.50 for the book.

this is a fascinating portrait of "literary narcissism," gabe, but
i'm not sure ginsberg qualifies as an alcoholic just because he has a
few narcissistic tendencies (not many, actually; he was not a
clinical narcissist).  trungpa, his guru, was an acknowledged
alcoholic; that's no secret, and i think you're right to discern a
heavy dose of alcoholic acting-out in the famous incidents that led
to the so-called Naropa Poetry Wars.  ginsberg himself has always
struck me as fitting the profile of the co-dependent, following his
relationship with his mother Naomi.  His partner Peter has had -and i
think continues to have -many struggles with addictions, including
alcoholism, and many of Ginsberg's dearest friends (kerouac,
burroughs, corso) likewise.  ginsberg went through codependency
treatment at Hazelden around his relationship w/ Peter, i believe in
the 1980s.  Ginsberg has never struck me as an addict, except perhaps
in his sexual loneliness and manic attempts to appeal to young men.
it is easy -for me at least -to have a lot of compassion for him, but
then again i am fairly codependent myself.

One could even make the argument that Ginsberg's "narcissism"
(which could conceivably be a fitting characterization, if the word
 is understood as not-necessarily pejorative)
actually saved him from some of his other addictions....

and not just true of Ginsberg;
   to me "narcissism" is such a vague bogey-man
   and rather than judge it, to me, the question is,
   well, what good can come from it?
   And sometimes a lot of good can....

Gabriel,
Ah yes, imagine my surprise to turn on the tube  in 1973 and find . . . a
sitcom whose plot outline was . . . "
A stage and a wagon heading west gets separated from the rest of the wagon
train thanks to Dusty. Now they must make their way to California". It was
'Dusty's Trail' and guess who Dusty was. . .  could it be our beloved
'little buddy' . . . plot seems vaguely familiar?
Or how about a 1968 post Gilligan situation which finds our beloved
protagonist a common 'soda jerk' in a short-lived sitcom 'The Good Guys', my
goodness,life has changed significantly from the beatnik days of Maynard G.
Krebs. Goodbye Gilligan you will be missed.

I'm not sure where the idea of Allen being an alcoholic derives from?
Was a student at naropa and knew him from there (81) until he died and
never really saw him drinking a whole lot or being drunk. Is it
something w/ him dying of liver cancer????? (which, as I understand,
was linked to having had hepatitis years before)

Narcissism rather loaded== clinically, more having to do with a lack of
empathy than self-involvement. Allen was a very complex man who
actually put a lot of time in therapy trying to deal with issues in his
life. I always found him very compassionate and generous -- after he
died, Bob Rosenthal and his wife Shelly Kraut were inundated with phone
calls to their home for days by devastated  people with whom Allen had
made a meaningful connection, even if what a brief conversation or a
letter. I was always amazed that he managed to stay fairly sane despite
the non-stop demands that were made upon him.

Not having had any relation to Neropa or having read The Great Neropa Poetry=

I vaguely remember the whole thing having to do with some sexual harrassment=

but I may be wrong. I have heard of Ginsberg's professed attempts to seduce=20

What surprises me about the post, Gabe, is that it seems so uncharacteristic=

of you, whom I always associated with succintness and wit. What exactly is a=

you do not refer to the word after the beginning, unless shame is by=20

What exactly is economy of attention? In that term I sense an attempt to=20

s=20
or assasination attempts in the last forty=3Dfive years. Officially, they we=
re=20
all committed by deranged people, the surest end run around having them=20
treated as politically significance.

Do you mean Gingsberg's work of the sixties and seventies were meaningless,=20
except as narcissistic acts, that he had a following because of the light of=

fame spilled from him?

I knew Ginsberg at a distance, exchanging greetings occasionally. I did not=20

generosity. My opinion of him as a person was more guarded. Let me only say,=
 I heard him=20
read a poem on the atomic bomb at the Bar Mitsvah of his friend's son,=20
something I find strange to this day. Nevertheless, I cherish his The White=20=

unforgettable poem.

Gabe, I sense behind your comments an attempt to revaluate Ginsberg's work,=20
which is completely understandable. It may be difficult -even ridiculous- to=

write a Ginsberg-like poem today. We live in different worlds, we believe in=

    The issue of narcissism is, I think, salient for all of us. The very act of making our art public has a bit of narcissism in it; we think that others should read us, love us, pay attention to what we've done. For me personally, narcissism rides alongside Jewish guilt. I'm neurotic to the point of mania about not being narcissistic, but my neurosis is, willy-nilly, very narcissistic! And it needs to be said that Allen Ginsberg put tremendous energy not only into promoting himself, but promoting his friends. Ginsberg was never a "loner" figure like Dylan or Stevens; it was always "love me, love my group". He'd go to bat for anyone he loved. And from what I've read, many loved him. Did he brew scandal purposely? Probably. But I think he wanted to be subversive not for his own glory, but to affect societal changes that would be beneficial to all. He wasn't a saint, but how many saints are there? Wouldn't be surprised if Ginsberg, too, was stricken with a certain amount of Jew
ish
 guilt. Remember the anecdote of Allen confessing his homosexuality to Louis...and I think one subtext of "Kaddish" is guilt for the inability to save Naomi. She probably made him feel that nothing he did was enough. Jewish mothers! Sometimes I think the goyim don't know the meaning of family strife....
     On a completely different tack, responses have started to come in from my call for New Orleans elegies. I've posted three of them so far, from Steve Dalachinsky, Tom Savage, and Jodiann Stevenson. You can check 'em out at www.artrecess.blogspot.com. If you'd like to submit, send me something at afieled@yahoo.com. Or even buzz me at (610) 608-2094. I find random calls exciting. And I'm not put off by narcissists!

"The issue of narcissism is, I think, salient for all
of us. The very act of making our art public has a bit
of narcissism in it; we think that others should read
us, love us, pay attention to what we've done."

My thoughts exactly. Too, one wonders if the many
writers and MFA programs are a tribute to this
anomaly--rather than to craft, or, dare say, the value
of ideas. I've heard many anecdotes relating to
Ginsberg, good ones, of course, and then those where
pots and pans were thrown out of windows in wee
morning hours while in drunken rage. Seems to me the
work's most important, not so much how he managed to
walk in his 'very real life' shoes. Odd thing is that
I've been meeting fewer and fewer interesting writers
on my travels--and more anticeptic ones.

i can't remember, Maria, what it was i read in GNPW that made me
characterize Ginsberg as alcoholic. anyway, the book's not in front of me
right now. Trungpa easily was, yeah, and Orlovsky, an addict I'd heard. To
be frank, my thinking about the economies of attention surrounding scandal
making stemmed only in part from reading GNPW and how appalled I was at the
pervasive atmosphere of paranoia not only in Tom Clark's report but the
interview transcripts. It also stems from observing recent blog as well as
listserv behaviors over the years (some of which I engaged in on this list
in late 1998).

and, chris, i like what you say about accepting the worst in us. reminds me
of Novalis's dictum, "We are close to waking up when we dream that we are
dreaming." i agree with you about embracing, accepting, allowing without
indulging, whatever out-of-balance traits one has in order to make some
good out of them, to bring them in line and make useful energy from them,
with them by them. unfortunately what i see oftentimes among friends who
are getting sicker by the day is this strong desire to DENY their own
"narcissism" or even their alcoholism or whatever their particular bete
noir might be. it ain't fun to watch.

Now here's something interesting. Thank you, Chris.

As you say, narcissism has become a vague boogey-man, and in this way it
really does have connections to "sociopathy." Whereas "sociopathy"
quickly becomes a catch-all term for the things psychotherapists and
armchair-psychotherapists fear in the individual, "narcissism" has
become a catch-all term for the things psychotherapists et. al. fear in
modern Western society. While those working in the psyche field attempt
to define behavior as an aspect of the individual, rather than defining
personality traits by the reactions of others, there is the inescapable
relationship between the individual and society, meaning that the way an
individual is percieved can lead the individual to "catch" "personality
disorders" that literally did not exist a few years ago. "Narcissism"
often becomes a way to describe this phenomenon; if a person acts like a
dyslexic manic depressive with ADHD and Asperger's, but didn't have any
of those illnesses before they became headlines, they could be said to
be using the illnesses as "narcissistic supply."

So as the term becomes pop-psyche, I think we can safely put it in the
realm of "pejorative," at least for the next couple of decades. And
that's just fine, and has nothing to do with whether or not it has
value. Presumably, a poet doesn't fear the pejorative "layabout," so
what's one more pejorative between artists? But I'm too influenced by
the psyche world, and the term has become fuzzy for me. How do you
define narcissism, and what are its benefits?

Yours,
--

Hello Everyone,

My wife and I lived in Louisiana for 13 years, most of that time in New
Orleans.  We remember a song whose lyrics went something like "New Orleans ladies,
they sashay down, they sashay down -- from Bourbon Street to Esplanade."  The
song appeared sometime in the 1980s.  Can anyone from the area, or elsewhere,
identify this song?  We've been searching the various lyrics databases on the
net with no luck.

Thanks.

Best, Bill

This is the first page to c0me up googling the phrase "from Bourbon
Street to Esplanade":

http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/3131/neworleansladies.html

There's a QuickTime player at the bottom of the page with an excerpt
from a recording by a group named LeRoux. It's very short, but
probably enough for you to know if it's what you're looking for.

Dear People On My (Continuous Peasant) Mailing List---

I don't usually like to do this, and I certainly can understand why this may
seem like an INAPPROPRIATE request on my part in the wake of the recent
tragedy in New Orleans
and rural LA and MISS, but why I am writing to you to ask for economic (or
barter) help relates,
in no small part, to the difficult task of rebuilding that city (especially
if there's to be
even the slightest hope that the city can be rebuilt in a way that can keep
what was TRULY best about it--not as Bush and Corporate America will define
it).

So I'll "cut to the chase," I just wrote a song about the New Orleans
tragedy (it's a slow country waltz ala some John Prine), and I'm assembling
musicians to record it (Willy Seekamp has graciously donated studio time),
hopefully in the next two weeks, and because of the timely nature of it, I'd
rather not wait until the next Continuous Peasant album, but would like to
release it as a "single"
(a vinyl 7 inch perhaps, though I suppose that's a novelty; maybe a "CD
single"; ideally I could find another musician who has also written a song
about this tragedy and it could be a SPLIT SINGLE--
Please LET ME KNOW if you have),
and then go about selling it and donating all profits to a fund for the
rebuilding New Orleans (in the spirit of THULANI DAVIS's recent remarks;
which you can find on my blog--
http://blog.myspace.com/continuouspeasant


So here's how you could help. If you happen to know any record label that
will be willing to release the song, and write it off as a donation, etc
(the publicity they could get may also be a positive), please let me know.
Or if you know a vinyl pressing plant, who would be willing to donate their
services to help make the timely release of this song a reality, please let
me know. Finally, if you know neither of these, and would be interested in
helping fund the project (it would probably cost at least $1000 to press one
thousand singles), that would also be greatly appreciated (I could try to
work out some arrangement so you'd get your money back if that's a
condition).

I'm going to try every angle I have to make this a reality, for even though
I believe
the best "topical" songs do have a universal element, and if I wait another
year or so until we have another album finished, the song will still have
some AESTHETIC VALUE, but
I also believe that the time to ACT is now, and yes I do believe that the
Topical Song is a form of action, and unfortunately most of the stuff you
hear (even on COLLEGE radio)  or read about (even in the so-called "indie"
press) DOES NOT do that; it may be a small gesture, and not worth your time
and money, but I guess it does no harm in asking, and I won't bug you again
about it.

Thanks for listening,

Chris Stroffolino, Continuous Peasant

I added "lyrics" to the phrase Herb Levy Googled and came up with this. Its
link is blow.

As a general note, if you want to look up song lyrics, insert "lyrics"  onto
Google's search line along with the lyrics in quotes. I've found some
ancient but incredible songs that way.

New Orleans ladies;
Sassy style that will drive you crazy...
And they hold you like the light
Hugs the wick when this candle's burnin'.
Them Creole babies;
Thin and brown and downright lazy...They roll just like a river:
A little wade will last forever.
All the way....from Bourbon Street to Esplanade,
They sashay by... They sashay by.
New Orleans ladies;
A flair for life, love, and laughter...
And they hold you like the night
Holds a chill when this cold winds blowin'.

hand, I want to select works that are somehow representative (of what? of
whom? of when? of where?) and that would be supported by some kind of
consensus (again, consensus of whom?); but at the same time I am aware that
this is an opportunity to introduce readers in Iran and other
Persian-speaking countries-and Persian-speaking populations in the "Iranian
diaspora"-to writers and works that would provide a different kind of window
into the US, its people and its culture. And then there is also the question
of which books might and might not be translatable. I have not myself begun
to think about who my own choices might be since I am waist deep in another
project that is demanding all of my attention. Any and all suggestions from
people on the list, therefore, will be most welcome.



Thanks in advance-

I added "lyrics" to the phrase Herb Levy Googled and came up with this. Its

As a general note, if you want to look up song lyrics, insert "lyrics"  onto

Google's search line along with the lyrics in quotes. I've found some

ancient but incredible songs that way.

Thanks a ton, Vernon.  Not only did we try eight different lyrics sites
without success, i.e., no matches, but our google search kept kicking our AOL
connection.  This sometimes happens on Sundays when half the country is on AOL.  We
did find the Le Roux website, but no lyrics.

Having lived in New Orleans for nine years (Baton Rouge for four), my wife
and I are pretty down right now.  "New Orleans Ladies" and Randy Newman's
"Louisiana" are two tracks we must get hold of immediately.  I've already ordered
from Amazon.

Hope all goes well with you.

Thanks, Nate. My understanding is that they want three titles in the
post-modern section, though they have not specified how many fiction and how
many poetry.

nyc, sadly, is not the greatest of bookstore towns.  i suppose because the
rents are too high--loads of barnes and nobles.  though a few gems persist.
st. marks bookstore, gotham city books, the strand (though you can rarely
find anything in particular you may be looking for), labrynth.  those are
the best i can think of.  good luck.

best,

MIME-Version: 1.0

***Atticus/Finch is very pleased to announce the release of its sixth
chapbook, Gregg Biglieri’s I Heart My Zeppelin. Biglieri’s long been
working in the shadows, preparing a veritable poetry-world takeover,
giving us little prescient glimpses into “life after Biggs” by
intermittently releasing a chapbook here and there—his first,
Profession, published by Idiom in 1997, followed by Roma (Beautiful
Swimmer 1999) and Reading Keats to Sleep (Cuneiform 2003). And folks,
when he’s king, we’ll all be in shipshape! These poems are careful and
cunning and punny and damn thoroughly worked. AND, word on the street
is we can expect a full-length collection from Cuneiform Press SOON!

Take, for example:

Plot us, Platus
To cross up the fates
Like little needles prick us
To nip listening.

None too swiftly
The subs set out
To veer off course—
Yahoos in tow.

Veterans, damn your
Torpedoes.
Untruth will never stop
Till there are no more
Suds in your tubs.

So let us plot me
No plots—an aster
Astir in all risk:
Even if it sees
What we mean too late
Language is swifter than that.

Nick Lawrence sez:

“Not Is anybody out there? but Is anybody in here?—where the mic check
of poetry’s address inheres in recognition of the seriousness of
wordplay’s work, its deftness a counter to the deafness of
officialdom, the lethal stumbles in articulacy that disjoint our times
and tangle policy lines. Marrying bruised soliloquies of the intimate
with silent talkback to televised preemption, these poems groove on
their own disenchantment like a chorus of frog princes rejecting King
Log.”

And Craig Dworkin:

Gregg Biglieri takes the richness of language to task those who cede
so much as a syllable to the impoverishment of our current cultural
world. “Just because you don’t see it / Doesn’t mean it’s invisible,”
and “Even if it sees / What we mean too late / Language is swifter
than that.” Get yourself up to speed.

Murat, I had no intention of reassessing Ginsberg's work. My post, being
inexact re Ginsberg, was on that account quite irresponsible. As I (think
I) said to Maria earlier, my post originated from some Saturday morning
musings about not only GNPW (as well as thinking about a Clayton Eshleman
essay) but also watching recent shenanigans around two experimental presses
and a few issues on blogs and listserves lately -- so that post, with all
its rather heavy handed pop psychology, is really not about G as a person
but G as an amalgamated Type that existed, brightly, in my own mind for
about 90 minutes SAturday morning. I don't know anything about psychology.

So, this was not meant tto be an attack (yr word) on Ginsberg. He merely
got mixed up in something he should have avoided. Kind of like me. I merely
wanted to put into words some thoughts about why a certain "personality
type" (whether Trungpa or another) might make investments in satire,
fights, scandal, etc.

just received my first hurricane relief scam email -- it purported to be a

Nagin, but it read very much like one of those experiments we like to do by

&NOW: A Festival of Innovative Writing and Art
April 5-7, 2006, Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, IL (30 miles north of =
Chicago)
Proposal Deadline, October 15, 2005
http://www.lakeforest.edu/&now
andnow@lfc.edu
****

This three-day festival, with two-time National Book Critics Circle =
Award
winner William H. Gass as featured writer (others TBA), will celebrate
contemporary aesthetic practice in its most inventive forms: writing,
visual, and multimedia art that is aware of its own institutional and
extra-institutional history, that is as much about its form and
materials-about language-as about subject matter.

&NOW will bring together a range of writers and artists
interested in exploring the possibilities of form and the limits of
expression; writers and artists working to emphasize text as a medium
and as an influence.

If traditional, mainstream art and literature are the equivalents of
19th Century still-life, innovative production might be the text
scrawled on genetically engineered cells--works more interested in
producing fantastic machines of art, rather than creating transparent
windows to a world that no longer exists.

By bringing together innovative writers and artists, &NOW/LFLF will
take stock of the "other" tradition-and perhaps offer a glimpse of
where it is going.

Proposal Deadline: October 15, 2005 for readers of this as

You can also hop the L Train, which runs across 14th Street in Manhattan, and be in Williamsburg, Brooklyn within five minutes.  You will find Spoonbill and Sugartown (http://www.spoonbillbooks.com/), which seems to be having really nice weekend sales as of late, and Clovis Press ( http://www.urban75.org/photos/newyork/ny238.html) on Bedford Avenue (the first stop in Brooklyn).  Both sell used (& new) books.

There are tons of little places to eat too that are often cheaper than Manhattan dining, all within walking distance (http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/restaurants/index.html).

Enjoy!

I'm glad I could help.

I don't use AOL, so that probably kept me from geting interference.

I can understand your being down, after nine years of callin gNew Orleans
home. I never made it there when I was younger and could have torn up the
French Quarter nonstop. Now I won't even get the chance to enjoy it as an
old fart.

Try to keep your spirits up. From what I can figure, a lot of New Orleans
life was about just that.

As Ever,

Yes, you will be able to enjoy it!!! The French
Quarter and Marigny, and uptown are virtually
undamaged. Molly's and Johnny White's, both in the
Quarter, literally never closed--even during the
storm. The Southern Decadence gay pride parade went on
as scheduled the day before Labor Day--even if
radically scaled back to only 20 or so
mourner-revelers. I guarantee you that there will be
at least a scaled-down, locals-dominated Mardi Gras
(as it should be, at any rate) in February. I'm going
to do my best to get away from school to make it and I
encourage everyone else on this list to do the same.

New Orleans WILL be rebuilt. And even if there's a
horrific "modernized," Disney-fied strip mall
aesthetic  Lake Front and/or 9th Ward (worst case
scenario--but locals will fight it to the very bitter
end), the majority of the city will look and feel the
same as die-hard New Orleanians (most of my friends
are absolutely determined to cede their city neither
to Katrina nor Bush/Cheney/Halliburton) move back,
reclaim, and rebuild.

So go to New Orleans in a few months and "tear up" the
French Quarter to your "old fart's" content! Go to
Dave Brinks' 17 Poets! reading series at the Goldmine
on St. Peter St. on Thursday and bar hop your way
through the live music down Frenchman on Friday.
And--if you must--you can tour the fratty bars and
strip clubs along upper Bourbon on Saturday. Don't
forget Snake & Jake's Cristmas Tree Lounge, F&M Patio
Bar,  and the Buddha Belly uptown. You can book-end
your Sunday uptown tour at The Maple Leaf Club,
starting with the afternoon reading series Everett
Maddox started 25+ years ago and that Nancy Harris
still runs and end the evening back there with
whatever local brass or jazz or rock band is playing
that night, and, with the right amount of the right
kind of cocktails, you might just think the night is
just beginning and start out on your uptown bar tour
all over again....

Thanks for the reassuring news, Tod. After the tragedy, my gallows humor had
me envisioning the reconstruction of New Orleans in contemporary not
historic mode: a night prowling the French Quarter Plaza or hearing jazz at
Preservation Mall. I'm glad the spirit will be their and that the buildings
will reflect it. Maybe I'll burn the night oil a time or two when I get
there.

Best,

Vernon

The altered books project at:

http://www.logolalia.com/alteredbooks/

has been updated with new work by: Meghan Scott, Sheila E. Murphy,
Mike Magazinnik, Nico Vassilakis, John M. Bennett, Holly Crawford,
Kevin Thurston, David-Baptiste Chirot, Adeena Karasick, and Kristen
McQuillin.

We had some things happen last month that I thought might be of
interest.

The altered books site gets a fair amount of regular traffic. The
participants do some self-promotion, and I make a monthly plug on a
couple of the listservs, and it has slowly but surely built up a small
but regular readership.

I'm kind of a geek, so I'll occasionally watch the webserver's access
logs in real time. What I watched last month was pretty amazing--I
watched a lot of it happening, but then stopped watching to free up
webserver resources to serve up pages as the hammering really kicked
in.

As near as I can piece together, I think it all started with a mention
at a hugely popular blog called grow-a-brain
(http://growabrain.typepad.com/growabrain/), which then got passed
along by the j-walk blog (http://j-walkblog.com/), and from there it
just started spreading like mad, sometimes to the unlikeliest of
places. Ten, then twenty, then more and more blogs around the world
started pointing to it, all in the span of about a day, a day and a
half. Then it hit metafilter (http://www.metafilter.com/) and things
got really crazy. It maxed out at a one day high of 1143 visitors
(36542 hits), and 627 unique referrers. The total visitors for the
month of August ended up at 7642. Not bad for an in progress visual
poetry project.

The best news is that we seemed to have retained a healthy portion of
those readers, as well. Nowhere near all of them, by any means, but
after the spike cleared and things have settled down, it looks like
total daily traffic has about tripled. Yay intarweb!

Regards,
Dan

our social order. And the history of those contradictions.

Many things have gone on in the response to Katrina:

Things including war on the poor, which is business as usual for this=20
social order. Those who were already poor (employed or not) when Katrina=20
hit are certainly poorer in the wake of the disaster.

Things including both the dynamics of racism in movements and undertakings=

and the expressions of racism in the large conversation.

Things including the fierce and generally unacknowledged messiness of the=20
dynamics of racism and classism and the entangling of race and class=20

=20

[various newspaper articles, White House Press Release] =96 an enrichment=20
that is a shoutout to the richest part of Bush=92s base.

The casual throwaway racist language of =93savages running wild=94, of=
 =93people=20
who should be grateful that the disaster will provide them with a better=20
life=94 in the Astrodome; the cliches about black welfare dependency and the=

cover for the work of dismantling, one disaster or crisis at a time if=20
necessary, the idea that our social order can expect its government=20

American Spectator), online fora] to do more for its citizenry than to=20
usher public money to what it sees as that money=92s =93rightful=94 owners,=
 the=20
corporations that paid for the heads of that government=92s election.

The response to this disaster does not have to be actually racist; racism=20
is so much a part of our culture that it is always available as a simple=20
tool of convenience. It can be called onto duty and then dismissed. One of=
=20
the jobs that it does terrifically well, again and again, is to divert=20
attention from what else is happening. The public imagination was focused=20
on the scary blackness of people massed at the Superdome or the Convention=
=20
Center, standing on the highway, standing on roofs. That vivid visibility=20
also pushes the other people (in their heterogeneity) also there out of the=
=20
picture frame until they are pulled into the picture as representations of=
=20
the not-black and scary =93properly=94 behaving fictions. I am describing a=
=20
relay of framing movement as these =93proper=94 victims are contrasted to=
 those=20
people spectacularly on display as visible contrasts to the =93lawless=94=
 and=20
the =93looters=94 of New Orleans.

Late last night I was taking a break from obsessing on the internet and saw=
=20
Tucker Carlson on CNN doing up a follow-up interview with Andre Broussard=20
(president of Jefferson Parish ) who, on Sunday, had broken down crying=20
after criticizing the federal government on =93Meet the Press.=94 Carlson=
 asked=20
Broussard to comment on the awfulness of the looting in New Orleans (cue=20
pictures of burning buildings in NO), and Broussard said, =93well, some of=
=20
that is going on here too. Our shopping center burned on Wednesday.=94=20
Broussard went on to describe what the police and national guard were=20
having to contend with in his area.

It was a moment when the possibility of bad non-black actors was at least=20
alluded to. It was also a moment that passed really quickly.

The comfortably well-off U.S. (and/or those who simply want comfort and=20
aren=92t too particular about what it costs in other people) =96 can have=
 that=20
desire for comfort fed by the disciplining of the visible poor =96 the=20
dangerous classes.

I want to be clear, so I=92m going to say this as directly as I can. I=92m=
=20
bringing together four areas of concern: (1) the presence of racism does=20
not mean the absence of class warfare against the poor and working class;=20
(2) a war on the poor does not mean that people of considerable color=20
aren=92talso the easier targets; (3) the analytic insufficiency of a U.S.=20
black/white binary around racial thinking does not mean that other =93others=
=94=20
can=92t be thought about; and (4) the attention being paid to particular=20
subsets of objects of governmental criminal negligence does not mean we=20
shouldn=92t all be terrified of the closing down of idea of a common good.
* * * * *
I=92m going to finish here with some attention to =93looting=94 =96 both the=
 idea=20
and the activity. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked,=
=20
and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country=
=20
to greater danger." -- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials.

The September 2nd - 5th weekend edition of USA Today (online) ran as one of=
=20
its sub- headline (in the online edition, it was to the right of the main=20
headline): =93Lawlessness Fosters Fear.=94 A word here about lawlessness and=
=20
its class belonging. If we are not a lawless nation from the very top of=20
our government=92s hierarchy, I don=92t know what we are. (Actually existing=
=20
criminals ought to be indignant at the expressions of hypocrisy.) We are up=
=20
to our noses in a lawless war gerry-rigged by lies; we are led by an=20
administration for whom laws and regulations that get in the way of the=20
good of corporations are routinely ground under its wheels; the engine of=20
help that took its time getting to the disaster region is a product of that=
=20
lawlessness and disregard for its people. Our attention is being directed=20
to the lawlessness of individuals, and we respond with fear: =93that could=
=20
happen here, that could happen to me.=94 And we are gratified when =93order=
=94 is=20
talked about and seems to have been restored. Sometimes all that is=20
required for the achievement of that satisfaction is to see a black male=20
lying on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back [archive:=20
newspapers, television, online fora, conversation].

In the meantime, we are at the mercy of a lawless over-class that is=20
looting the state and a state that is looting itself for its friends (yet=20
another Hello to Halliburton) and that is invisible to us. The reek of=20
sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness that is drifting outward from the=
=20
haves of the Bush administration and condemning not only looters, people=20
who =93didn=92t have the sense to leave,=94 the local governments, and the=
=20
poor=96the poor , who Barbara Bush tells us are better off now that they=92r=
e=20
in the Astrodome than they=92ve ever been in their lives=96well, the stench=
 of=20
that self-righteousness rivals for noxiousness the smell of shit from the=20
NO Superdome and Convention Center that people there had to breathe for=20
almost a week.

In the U.S. state we seem to be really particular about our tolerance of=20
looters. In fact, we have a tiered system for even thinking about them.=20
Within this community of thought, the absolute bottom is occupied by people=
=20
who steal TVs. The lowest of that low are those who might barter the TVs=20
for drugs; slightly above them (but still lower than a snake=92s belt=
 buckle)=20
are those who steal TVs and might barter them for water, money, clothing,=20
etc.; rising above them are those who are looting food, water, shoes,=20
clothing for their own use or that of others=92 close to them (who=20
nonetheless, President Bush told us, should be included in the most dire=20
penalty for looting).

By contrast, occupying the very top tier of looters would be the big state=
=20
actors, like the Bush administration, looting the national budget for its=20
illegal war and accompanied by the war and disaster profiteers who are=20
engorging themselves and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future=
=20
but who, I admit, aren=92t often photographed carrying away their billions=
 in=20
plastic garbage bags while running down the street.

When people start talking about a shoot-to-kill policy for looters, aren=92t=
=20
they in danger of committing the crime of threatening the life of the=20
President of the U.S.?

We might want to think about why it is the petty thief who gets shot while=
=20
these other looters simply get richer (Hello Dick Cheney=96I wanted a break=
=20
from saying Halliburton).

Finally, to those who have said and continue to say that this isn=92t about=
=20
race or class, you simply aren=92t paying attention. What is happening is,=
 of=20
course, about more than those social facts, but the existence of those=20
social realities within a nation that allows itself to accommodate those=20
realities will be rewarded with all the horrors brought on by the public=92s=
=20
inability to see what has been and continues to be made within the terms of=
=20
that accommodation. We accept living within a world of unequal division of=
=20
resources. We accept living in a state that is intent upon re-making the=20
world to its accommodation. We accept the tearing down of a material fabric=
=20
of governmental responsibility for which we pay with our taxes. And we=20
accept this in some significant part because class inequality and racial=20
inequality are as American as apple pie. The politics of death are=20
articulated in the life we deny the most vulnerable of our people. And the=
=20
life that is increasingly going to be denied to more and more of us.

Hi, folks,

For a talk I'm writing, I'd be interested to hear your suggestions--mostly,=
 though not exclusively, for work in the avant / post-avant traditions--for=
 post-WWII poems (or generic hybrids) that incorporate footnotes or other a=
pparatus into the text or in which the text is constructed out of such appa=
ratus.  Examples I'm working with so far include work by Charles Olson, ED =
Dorn, Jack Spicer, Bob Perelman, Brenda Hillman, Juliana Spahr, Brian Kim S=
tefans, Tyrone Wiliams, Jenny Boully, Eileen Tabios, Barrett Watten, Paul V=
ioli, Jena Osman, Armand Schwerner, Charles Bernstein, Gabriel Gudding.  Fr=
ont or back channel is fine.

I won't be doing much with earlier examples in this mode (e.g., Dunciad to =
Pound, Eliot, Moore), but if you think of some that are particularly striki=
ng, well, I'd appreciate hearing of those too.

Thanks in advance,

Alan,

Irving Weiss's book "Visual Voices" (Runaway Spoon Press, 1994), has a
piece titled "Barnacled Poem, Being Dragged Down Under" that fits your
description, I think.

Hi, All--

I know many of you are in academia, and teach creative writing.  I will
be teaching creative writing (an advanced level course devoted solely
to poetry) in the spring, and I haven't taught it in quite a while.
What I have found in the past is that these courses are usually filled
with "tortured soul" types, who just really want to read their work
which is in their mind already perfect.  No one usually wants to be
serious about writing as a process and a learning experience, or about
poetry as a genre.  I've taught this class a dozen different ways and
none of them has been all that successful in my mind.  I've done
workshops, used textbook-like-books, used self-help-like books, had
them adhere to form, had them write papers, had them keep portfolios,
had them give readings, had them (gasp!) read other poets--it just
always feels like there is so little learning in the class.  Students
come in convinced that they are brilliant and have the single-most
important thing ever to say in their poem...and they leave thinking the
same thing!  Anyone have any ideas, suggestions, or experiences of
successful pedagogies, books, syllabae, etc?

Thanks So Much--

Have them write poems to do with the wider world. Use Carolyn Forche's
anthology Against Forgetting.  Or Poetry Like Bread.  Or make them write
poems form an imaginative character's point of view ( for example My Last
Duchess).  Use Jerome Rothenberg's anthology Technicians of the Sacred and
have them write ritual poems or poetic plays (like Pound's Noh Plays).

There's a lot of ways to write that aren't strictly autobiographical and
self tortured that might help them zoom out and expand. I think the more
experimentation, the better. Have them make centos. Have them do
mistranslations. Have them "imitate" poets who write in very different
styles.

Have them collaborate, as well.

Good luck!

New Experiments: Catherine Wagner on Prelapsarian Poetics


Catherine Wagner writes: "Recent works by two poets from the astonishing
generation previous to mine -- Leslie Scalapino and Alice Notley --
demonstrate equally radical versions of a prelapsarian poetics: both assert a
Fall that their poetry seeks to counter or pre-empt. What are the risks and
benefits of a prelapsarian poetics, and what can politically minded younger
poets learn from it?"


Catherine Wagner is the author of Macular Hole (Fence, 2004), Miss America
(Fence, 2001), and many chapbooks. Rae Armantrout calls her work "really
strong and brave." Wagner's latest poems are in recent issues of Black Clock,
The Hat, American Letters & Commentary, and Shearsman. She gave readings this
summer at The Cork International Poetry Festival in Ireland and at England's
Sheffield Poetry International. She teaches at Boise State University in
Idaho, where she lives with her husband and two-year-old son.

Before Boully wrote The Body, Jennifer Martenson wrote Xq28, available from Burning Deck. It's most distinctive quality is precisely its hybridity (not just the fact that it's written in the form of footnotes); it's somewhere between a poem and and an essay exploring constructions of sexuality and lesbian identity.

Cheers,

Narcissus Jones









is remembered for having fallen in love with himself.



A poet of uncertain parentage, Narcissus, was loved

by Apollo and is counted among the most handsome of men,

was, according to some, the son of the river god Cephisus and the nymph
Liriope, or according to others, the son of Endymion and Selene.



The beauty of Narcissus was compared to that of Adonis, whom Aphrodite
loved,

or to that of Endymion, whom Selene loved, or to that of Ganymedes, whom
Zeus loved, or to that of Hyacinthus, whom Apollo loved, or to that of
Hylas, whom Heracles loved, or to that of Hermaphroditus, whom Salmacis
loved,
or to that of Chrysippus , whom Laius loved.





When Narcissus was born the seer Tiresias was asked

whether this child would live a long life, the seer replied:



"If he never knows himself"



When the nymph Echo fell in love with him and her love was not returned,

she disappeared from woods and mountains, and faded away. An indifferent
fellow



to the other nymphs and youths who were mocked by Narcissus,

until one of them prayed to heaven:



    "So may he himself love, and not gain the thing he loves"



When Narcissus, who was as beautiful as Dionysus or Apollo,

discovered his image in a pool, he fell in love with himself,

and not being able to find consolation, he died of sorrow by the same pool.



It is said that Narcissus still keeps gazing on his image in the waters

of the river Styx in the Underworld.



Upon prepared his funeral pyre, the grieving poets could not find his body,

in its place they found the flower that today bears his name.



Some reject that story and say, Narcissus, looking into the water,

did not understand that he saw his own reflection, and fell in love

with himself, dying of love at the spring.



For it is stupid to imagine, they argue, that a man old enough to fall in
love

was unable to distinguish a man from a man's reflection.



Instead they assert that Narcissus had a twin sister,

and that both were exactly alike in appearance.



He then fell in love with his sister, and when she died

he used to go to the spring, knowing that it was his reflection



that he saw, but finding some relief for his love because the reflection

reminded him of his sister. What a treacherous little flower.



And concerning the flower in which they say that the young man turned into,

it already existed at the time when Hades abducted Persephone, and became



"a snare for the bloom-like girl". For it was she, attracted by the sweet
scent

of the narcissus, gathered flowers over a meadow, that the earth opened



and Hades sprang out upon her with his immortal horses, and took her

to be the queen of the Underworld.

This from Counterpunch.



First By the Floods, Then By Martial Law


Trapped in New Orleans

By LARRY BRADSHAW
and LORRIE BETH SLONSKY

Two days after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the Walgreens store at
the corner of Royal and Iberville Streets in the city's historic French
Quarter remained locked. The dairy display case was clearly visible through
the widows. It was now 48 hours without electricity, running water,
plumbing, and the milk, yogurt, and cheeses were beginning to spoil in the
90-degree heat.

The owners and managers had locked up the food, water, pampers and
prescriptions, and fled the city. Outside Walgreens' windows, residents and
tourists grew increasingly thirsty and hungry. The much-promised federal,
state and local aid never materialized, and the windows at Walgreens gave
way to the looters.

There was an alternative. The cops could have broken one small window and
distributed the nuts, fruit juices and bottled water in an organized and
systematic manner. But they did not. Instead, they spent hours playing cat
and mouse, temporarily chasing away the looters.

We were finally airlifted out of New Orleans two days ago and arrived home
on Saturday. We have yet to see any of the TV coverage or look at a
newspaper. We are willing to guess that there were no video images or
front-page pictures of European or affluent white tourists looting the
Walgreens in the French Quarter.

We also suspect the media will have been inundated with "hero" images of
the National Guard, the troops and police struggling to help the "victims"
of the hurricane. What you will not see, but what we witnessed, were the
real heroes and sheroes of the hurricane relief effort: the working class
of New Orleans.

The maintenance workers who used a forklift to carry the sick and disabled.
The engineers who rigged, nurtured and kept the generators running. The
electricians who improvised thick extension cords stretching over blocks to
share the little electricity we had in order to free cars stuck on rooftop
parking lots. Nurses who took over for mechanical ventilators and spent
many hours on end manually forcing air into the lungs of unconscious
patients to keep them alive. Doormen who rescued folks stuck in elevators.
Refinery workers who broke into boat yards, "stealing" boats to rescue
their neighbors clinging to their roofs in flood waters. Mechanics who
helped hotwire any car that could be found to ferry people out of the city.
And the food service workers who scoured the commercial kitchens,
improvising communal meals for hundreds of those stranded.

Most of these workers had lost their homes and had not heard from members
of their families. Yet they stayed and provided the only infrastructure for
the 20 percent of New Orleans that was not under water.

* * *

ON DAY Two, there were approximately 500 of us left in the hotels in the
French Quarter. We were a mix of foreign tourists, conference attendees
like ourselves and locals who had checked into hotels for safety and
shelter from Katrina.

Some of us had cell phone contact with family and friends outside of New
Orleans. We were repeatedly told that all sorts of resources, including the
National Guard and scores of buses, were pouring into the city. The buses
and the other resources must have been invisible, because none of us had
seen them.

We decided we had to save ourselves. So we pooled our money and came up
with $25,000 to have ten buses come and take us out of the city. Those who
didn't have the requisite $45 each were subsidized by those who did have
extra money.

We waited for 48 hours for the buses, spending the last 12 hours standing
outside, sharing the limited water, food and clothes we had. We created a
priority boarding area for the sick, elderly and newborn babies. We waited
late into the night for the "imminent" arrival of the buses. The buses
never arrived. We later learned that the minute they arrived at the city
limits, they were commandeered by the military.

By Day Four, our hotels had run out of fuel and water. Sanitation was
dangerously bad. As the desperation and despair increased, street crime as
well as water levels began to rise. The hotels turned us out and locked
their doors, telling us that "officials" had told us to report to the
convention center to wait for more buses. As we entered the center of the
city, we finally encountered the National Guard.

The guard members told us we wouldn't be allowed into the Superdome, as the
city's primary shelter had descended into a humanitarian and health
hellhole. They further told us that the city's only other shelter--the
convention center--was also descending into chaos and squalor, and that the
police weren't allowing anyone else in.

Quite naturally, we asked, "If we can't go to the only two shelters in the
city, what was our alternative?" The guards told us that this was our
problem--and no, they didn't have extra water to give to us. This would be
the start of our numerous encounters with callous and hostile "law
enforcement."

* * *

WE WALKED to the police command center at Harrah's on Canal Street and were
told the same thing--that we were on our own, and no, they didn't have
water to give us. We now numbered several hundred.

We held a mass meeting to decide a course of action. We agreed to camp
outside the police command post. We would be plainly visible to the media
and constitute a highly visible embarrassment to city officials. The police
told us that we couldn't stay. Regardless, we began to settle in and set up
camp.

In short order, the police commander came across the street to address our
group. He told us he had a solution: we should walk to the Pontchartrain
Expressway and cross the greater New Orleans Bridge to the south side of
the Mississippi, where the police had buses lined up to take us out of the
city.

The crowd cheered and began to move. We called everyone back and explained
to the commander that there had been lots of misinformation, so was he sure
that there were buses waiting for us. The commander turned to the crowd and
stated emphatically, "I swear to you that the buses are there."

We organized ourselves, and the 200 of us set off for the bridge with great
excitement and hope. As we marched past the convention center, many locals
saw our determined and optimistic group, and asked where we were headed. We
told them about the great news.

Families immediately grabbed their few belongings, and quickly, our numbers
doubled and then doubled again. Babies in strollers now joined us, as did
people using crutches, elderly clasping walkers and other people in
wheelchairs. We marched the two to three miles to the freeway and up the
steep incline to the bridge. It now began to pour down rain, but it didn't
dampen our enthusiasm.

As we approached the bridge, armed sheriffs formed a line across the foot
of the bridge. Before we were close enough to speak, they began firing
their weapons over our heads. This sent the crowd fleeing in various
directions.

As the crowd scattered and dissipated, a few of us inched forward and
managed to engage some of the sheriffs in conversation. We told them of our
conversation with the police commander and the commander's assurances. The
sheriffs informed us that there were no buses waiting. The commander had
lied to us to get us to move.

We questioned why we couldn't cross the bridge anyway, especially as there
was little traffic on the six-lane highway. They responded that the West
Bank was not going to become New Orleans, and there would be no Superdomes
in their city. These were code words for: if you are poor and Black, you
are not crossing the Mississippi River, and you are not getting out of New
Orleans.

* * *

OUR SMALL group retreated back down Highway 90 to seek shelter from the
rain under an overpass. We debated our options and, in the end, decided to
build an encampment in the middle of the Ponchartrain Expressway--on the
center divide, between the O'Keefe and Tchoupitoulas exits. We reasoned
that we would be visible to everyone, we would have some security being on
an elevated freeway, and we could wait and watch for the arrival of the
yet-to-be-seen buses.

All day long, we saw other families, individuals and groups make the same
trip up the incline in an attempt to cross the bridge, only to be turned
away--some chased away with gunfire, others simply told no, others verbally
berated and humiliated. Thousands of New Orleaners were prevented and
prohibited from self-evacuating the city on foot.

Meanwhile, the only two city shelters sank further into squalor and
disrepair. The only way across the bridge was by vehicle. We saw workers
stealing trucks, buses, moving vans, semi-trucks and any car that could be
hotwired. All were packed with people trying to escape the misery that New
Orleans had become.

Our little encampment began to blossom. Someone stole a water delivery
truck and brought it up to us. Let's hear it for looting! A mile or so down
the freeway, an Army truck lost a couple of pallets of C-rations on a tight
turn. We ferried the food back to our camp in shopping carts.

Now--secure with these two necessities, food and water--cooperation,
community and creativity flowered. We organized a clean-up and hung garbage
bags from the rebar poles. We made beds from wood pallets and cardboard. We
designated a storm drain as the bathroom, and the kids built an elaborate
enclosure for privacy out of plastic, broken umbrellas and other scraps. We
even organized a food-recycling system where individuals could swap out
parts of C-rations (applesauce for babies and candies for kids!).

This was something we saw repeatedly in the aftermath of Katrina. When
individuals had to fight to find food or water, it meant looking out for
yourself. You had to do whatever it took to find water for your kids or
food for your parents. But when these basic needs were met, people began to
look out for each other, working together and constructing a community.

If the relief organizations had saturated the city with food and water in
the first two or three days, the desperation, frustration and ugliness
would not have set in.

Flush with the necessities, we offered food and water to passing families
and individuals. Many decided to stay and join us. Our encampment grew to
80 or 90 people.

 From a woman with a battery-powered radio, we learned that the media was
talking about us. Up in full view on the freeway, every relief and news
organizations saw us on their way into the city. Officials were being asked
what they were going to do about all those families living up on the
freeway. The officials responded that they were going to take care of us.
Some of us got a sinking feeling. "Taking care of us" had an ominous tone
to it.

Unfortunately, our sinking feeling (along with the sinking city) was
accurate. Just as dusk set in, a sheriff showed up, jumped out of his
patrol vehicle, aimed his gun at our faces and screamed, "Get off the
fucking freeway." A helicopter arrived and used the wind from its blades to
blow away our flimsy structures. As we retreated, the sheriff loaded up his
truck with our food and water.

Once again, at gunpoint, we were forced off the freeway. All the law
enforcement agencies appeared threatened when we congregated into groups of
20 or more. In every congregation of "victims," they saw "mob" or "riot."
We felt safety in numbers. Our "we must stay together" attitude was
impossible because the agencies would force us into small atomized groups.

In the pandemonium of having our camp raided and destroyed, we scattered
once again. Reduced to a small group of eight people, in the dark, we
sought refuge in an abandoned school bus, under the freeway on Cilo Street.
We were hiding from possible criminal elements, but equally and definitely,
we were hiding from the police and sheriffs with their martial law, curfew
and shoot-to-kill policies.

The next day, our group of eight walked most of the day, made contact with
the New Orleans Fire Department and were eventually airlifted out by an
urban search-and-rescue team.

We were dropped off near the airport and managed to catch a ride with the
National Guard. The two young guardsmen apologized for the limited response
of the Louisiana guards. They explained that a large section of their unit
was in Iraq and that meant they were shorthanded and were unable to
complete all the tasks they were assigned.

* * *

WE ARRIVED at the airport on the day a massive airlift had begun. The
airport had become another Superdome. We eight were caught in a press of
humanity as flights were delayed for several hours while George Bush landed
briefly at the airport for a photo op. After being evacuated on a Coast
Guard cargo plane, we arrived in San Antonio, Texas.

There, the humiliation and dehumanization of the official relief effort
continued. We were placed on buses and driven to a large field where we
were forced to sit for hours and hours. Some of the buses didn't have air
conditioners. In the dark, hundreds of us were forced to share two filthy
overflowing porta-potties. Those who managed to make it out with any
possessions (often a few belongings in tattered plastic bags) were
subjected to two different dog-sniffing searches.

Most of us had not eaten all day because our C-rations had been confiscated
at the airport--because the rations set off the metal detectors. Yet no
food had been provided to the men, women, children, elderly and disabled,
as we sat for hours waiting to be "medically screened" to make sure we
weren't carrying any communicable diseases.

This official treatment was in sharp contrast to the warm, heartfelt
reception given to us by ordinary Texans. We saw one airline worker give
her shoes to someone who was barefoot. Strangers on the street offered us
money and toiletries with words of welcome.

Throughout, the official relief effort was callous, inept and racist. There
was more suffering than need be. Lives were lost that did not need to be lost.

also, do a lot of inclass writing and collaborative assignments, the
purpose of which is process and not evaluation; that way the emphasis
on individual ego is undercut.  i think it also important to let go
of trying to "humble" them, b/c probably underneath what may appear
to be arrogance is a lot of insecurity.  shifting to non-evaluative

Dear Shaunanne,

I think there are many approaches to this question.  Teaching offers =
several elements, all of which have rich potential: subject, methodology, =
texts, students, teacher.

Despite general scepticism regarding the teachability of writing and the =
very subject of creative writing in the culture I grew up in (Ireland), I =
have great regard for creative writing as a subject and useful discipline. =
 This is partly, maybe even mainly, due to the benefit I myself reaped =
from taking creative writing workshops in the community, and in graduate =
school.  Taking workshops as a student built writing into my weekly =
schedule, exposed me to discussion and new literature, and gave me
my first experience of a writing community, and audience.  I learned to =
respect what an audience can teach.  That's the first great thing about =
the question: the actual subject of creative writing (which I teach at =
Rhode Island School of Design and which has infinite applicability across =
the studio disciplines, and in life as a whole).  So I might ask you, =
Shaunanne, what has your own experience of taking creative writing classes =
been?  Enjoyable?  useful?  Which ones did you enjoy?  Which not?  Can you =
model the classes you now teach on successful classes which you have =
taken?

Secondly, methodology.  The creative writing practice of workshopping is, =
in my experience, a successful methodology.  I have extended its use to =
all my writing classes.  It works very well in 101.  I think the key to =
the success of the workshop method is that it helps build an appreciation =
of audience; also it helps gives purpose (i.e., communication) to writing =
which might otherwise be relatively purposeless.
Of course, creative writing methodology does not stop at the workshop, and =
indeed endless rounds of workshopping can be tedious.  I have built =
advanced poetry writing classes on other models, e.g., seminar focused on =
articulation of poetics and presentation of groups of poems rather than =
single poems; also classes which focus on publication, in a range of ways, =
rather than group analysis of class poems.  All poetry writing classes I =
teach have fantastic assigned texts.  That's obviously another key to =
teacher excitement.  I love the books.  No, excuse me, I LOVE the books.

Students: I guess I love the students too.  One amazing thing I learned =
recently is that a person can be a poet with very incomplete command of =
the language.  I learned this when I worked with a student who had limited =
English but boy could she dream up images and boy could she harness and =
exploit the English she knew.  Seems obvious maybe.  I learn slowly.  I =
learn so much from my students, if I can slow down.  And I don't just mean =
they give me cool music.  They tell me things I should know: they give me =
references; they teach me plenty; they love to write; they get a kick out =
of it; some of them write very very well.  I have taught at 4 schools in =
America: in Indiana, New York, Mississippi, and Rhode Island; also high =
school in Ireland.  It has been my experience that there are excellent =
students everywhere.
Incidentally, I just read MY FRESHMAN YEAR by Rebekah Nathan (Cornell UP =
2004 or 5).  It's a useful perspective (anthropology professor returns to =
college [her own college] as first year student).  But I got to say that, =
contrary to the understandable disaffection Nathan describes, as far as I =
can see students like poetry.  A lot.  How can they not!!!!

Teacher:  Well, I'm on sabbatical right now so obviously I think teaching =
is the best job in the world.  Even when I'm doing it though, I generally =
like teaching.  I don't know if I actually teach anyone anything but we do =
read and write a lot of poetry and it's a lot of fun.  I'm occasionally a =
"tortured soul" type myself but the classroom helps me put it aside for a =
while.  I think my students often do the same: they are fighting real =
demons, and trying to lay them aside.

All the teaching ideas you list below sound great: it makes for a varied =
syllabus.
I've been teaching 13 years: only recently did it occur to me I should =
teach what I actually know.  Up till then I taught to learn.  One of the =
first students I ever had,
when I asked him a question about another subject he was taking, said =
"It's not my job to teach you."  Sounds rude but he turned out to be a =
good guy and in some ways he was right.  When I did start to teach what I =
actually knew, I found out I knew very little: it was almost embarrassing =
teaching the few things I actually knew, and knew that worked for me, =
about writing.  But boy could I bring a lot of conviction to it! =20

The other thing is, I assign absolutely drop-dead brilliant books -- or =
books that *I* think are absolutely drop-dead brilliant and uncanny and =
the epitome of epitome!!!
When you are bringing such gifts into the classroom .... well what can I =
say.
I'm almost getting nostalgic right now.  Almost.

These are my few thoughts.  I'm sure others will have more to say, maybe =
more to the point.

Good luck!  Enjoy!

Remember talking to friend some years ago about
treatise I'd written on the process, and my aesthetic,
as they say. At time, I'd been in writer's group
(miserably artificial and vain thing in my own
estimation--as it's come down, really, to an
industry!?). I'd been reading and reading, doing
readings, and doing much of what's been suggested, and
he said, after kind words, that it might be more
worthwhile to get out there into the world in order to
have something to write about--to communicate.

Tell them to leave the clean space of self-lauditory
and hyper-institutionalized engines and create there
own. Tell them to sit in the filthy space of isolation
amid barking writers who've got lots of self-serving
motives at stake, asking themselves how much they
really want to write. Tell them to walk through
dangerous places and harsh revolutions in order to say
something needing to be said. Ask them to look for
someone capable of telling truth. Dare them to
communicate with someone who can't read, write, and
who they can't impress.

Tell them that not everything has been done before,
said before, thought or questioned before. Tell them
to make their poetry 'open'-- Remind them that priests
in gold robes used to adminster the holy mass,
speaking in Latin, with back against those needing
most to be so-called saved. And remind them of the
responsibility. Challenge them to develop an interior
world worthy of the greatest explorers of humanity,
divinity, and villainy.

Trial of poet for 'defiling idol' =20
By Subir Bhaumik=20
BBC News, Calcutta =20


An Indian court has ordered a leading Bengali poet to stand trial on
charges of defiling a Hindu goddess.=20

The court in India's West Bengal state was ruling on a lawsuit filed
against Sunil Gangopadhyay by an ex-policeman.=20

In an article in Bengal's biggest newspaper this year, Mr Gangopadhyay
was quoted as saying he was "sexually aroused" by an idol of Saraswati.=20

Retired policeman Bhibhuti Bhusan Nandy filed a lawsuit saying the
comments had hurt his religious sentiments.=20

Additional chief judicial magistrate in Calcutta's Alipore court, Manjit
Singh, ordered Mr Gangopadhyay to appear in court on 3 December.=20

The court also ordered legal proceedings against three others - Aveek
Kumar Sarkar, editor of the Anandabazar Patrika newspaper, its publisher
Bijit Kumar Basu, and chief executive Subir Mitra.=20

'Zealots'=20

Mr Gangopadhyay, 71, was quoted in Anandabazar as saying he had kissed
an idol of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, to satisfy his
desire.=20

Mr Nandy, who has retired as the chief of the paramilitary Indo-Tibetan
Border Police, filed a formal complaint with the police against the
author.=20

"I am delighted the court has started appropriate legal proceedings," Mr
Nandy said.=20

Mr Gangopadhyay told the BBC on Monday that he was not taking the case
seriously.=20

"Some religious zealots are playing this up - mine was a light-hearted
remark on Goddess Saraswati. Her idol did not evoke devotion in me when
I was young. I found her very attractive and that is what I said," said
Mr Gangopadhyay.=20

"In Bengal, Hindus are known to crack jokes at the expense of their gods
and goddesses and that's what I did," he said.=20

"I have done no wrong but the zealots are trying to attack me because I
am so critical of them. I am not afraid of them - as a writer I have the
freedom to say such things and I and my publisher will fight it out in
court."=20

Controversy

Mr Gangopadhyay is West Bengal's best known living poet and novelist
with more than 250 books to his name.=20

But he is no stranger to controversy.=20

Two years ago, there were protests outside a newspaper office in
Calcutta after he wrote about the sex life of Indian spiritual leader,
Ramakrishna Paramhansa.=20

He also described Kali, the Hindu goddess of power, as a "tribal whore",
triggering protests by Santhal tribes people and Hindus.=20

Last year, the Bangladesh government banned an issue of an Indian
magazine which carried a story by Mr Gangopadhyay in which he wrote
about the sex life of the Prophet Mohammad.=20

"Bum Stash: Early 21st Century"
by Brenda Coultas

The lot had been emptied by the police/city who put up a new fence and padlock
and took down the trees and crops, and replaced soil with gravel. This year some
crops pushed up again. Objects returned, this time under plastic, a long low
stick of furniture with nine drawers, one missing, a yellow mustard color.
Someone built a lean-to of mattresses, not steady and positioned a hubcap to
shelter a plant from sun. Someone collected the brass number 5, strung it on a
wire, and someone added a brown chipped water pitcher.

Later observed in secret, a man with magenta hair adding objects he found on the
street. I saw him sitting on a broken rowing machine and then on a broken
stationary bike; the exercise equipment rested on the gravel. When he left he
locked the gate with his own working lock.

Bum stash tore apart. Lean-to pushed over, same objects but did the police or
the magenta man tear it all down? (May 15 , 01)

Lot cleared and new gravel laid down, an orange shopping cart chained to fence.
( May 25, 01).

Orange shopping cart unchained and rolled to street corner, miniature boxed pie
and particle board inside basket. (2nd & 1st, June 10,01).

Two white 70s appliances/ On one corner, washer with an oval window in the door,
laundry inside w/ brown mold/ on the other corner, dryer./ No one can write much
nowadays because it takes money/ in the 70s people wrote all the time, now/ we
don't have room to lay it all out, so lay parts at a time, pick them up and then
lay some more/ I iron and bake that way and try to think of things to do for

And don't forget Housing Works Cafe on Crosby st. in Soho. And on Waverly
near 10th st. there is a good place "Three Lives & Co," on 12th st. and 6
ave there is a great magazine shop, Nikos, that has a good selection of
literary mags. Around the corner from the Strand is a good place and there
are a few others around there if you look carefully. There's a few
shakespeare's and co. around the city, in particular one on Broadway at
Washington or Waverly. And like the fruit and veggies in this city, some of
the best book sellers are on the street throughout the city, theres some
good ones near the SE corner of Washington Square. There's a used place on
Mercer St. near W 3rd st. And there's Skyline books on 18th between 5th and
6th ave--though despite what someone on this list said earlier, they are not
too very small-press friendly, which is understandable in Manhattan given
the space constraints. As Amy K pointed out, brooklyn has some good places,
Spoonbill has great art books, in Park Slope there is community bookstore,
in cobble hill area there is BookCourt and near there on the waterfront is a
cool little shop Freebird Books, etc.... read on.

nyc, sadly, is not the greatest of bookstore towns.  i suppose because the
rents are too high--loads of barnes and nobles.  though a few gems persist.
st. marks bookstore, gotham city books, the strand (though you can rarely
find anything in particular you may be looking for), labrynth.  those are
the best i can think of.  good luck.

(1984), and What It Means To Be Avant-Garde (1993). Tuning was awarded the
prize for poetry for 1984 by the PEN Center of Los Angeles. Much of his
earlier poetry was collected in Selected Poems 1963-1973 published by Sun
and Moon Press in 1991. Dalkey Archive recently republished his 1972 book
talking (originally published by Kulchur Foundation) with a Preface by
Marjorie Perloff and a Postface by David Antin. Granary Books recently
published A Conversation with David Antin, the text of a 3 month email
conversation between David Antin and Charles Bernstein. A new collection of
talk pieces, i never knew what time it was, has just been published by the
University of California Press. His Selected Essays are being prepared for
publication by the University of Chicago Press. He spent the Winter of 2002
as a Fellow at the Getty Research Institute

work has appeared in Aught, Big Bridge, First Intensity, Jack Magazine, Los=
t
and Found Times, Moria, Miami Sun Post, Muse Apprentice Guild, Sidereality,
Xstream, and many other literary magazines. His web site is
http://vernonfrazer.com. Most recent works are the long poems =B3Avenue Noir=B2
and Improvisations (Beneath the Underground), the now-completed work that h=
e
introduced in his 2001 reading at the Poetry Project. Frazer lives most of
the year in South Florida. David Antin is a  poet, performance artist, art
and literary critic internationally known for his "talk pieces" --
improvisational blends of comedy, story and social commentary. New
Directions has published three books of these "talk pieces" =AD Talking at th=
e
Boundaries (1976), Tuning (1984), and What It Means To Be Avant-Garde
(1993). Tuning was awarded the prize for poetry for 1984 by the PEN Center

1963-1973 published by Sun and Moon Press in 1991. Dalkey Archive recently
republished his 1972 book talking (originally published by Kulchur
Foundation) with a Preface by Marjorie Perloff and a Postface by David
Antin.  Granary Books recently published A Conversation with David Antin,

The Life of Poetry: A Tribute to Muriel Rukeyser
Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) is one of our country's most influential yet
neglected writers. She published fifteen collections of poetry, plays,
translations, children's books, and several works of nonfiction. Her
collection of essays The Life of Poetry was reprinted by Paris Press in
2005. Readers will include Eileen Myles, Martin Moran, Hortense Calisher,
Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, Eleanor Wilner, Marie Ponsot and other special
guests. Participants will honor Rukeyser's assertion that living with the
arts, especially poetry, helps us to respond to the world around us with al=
l
our senses, resisting numbness, apathy, and the paralysis of fear. They wil=
l
read passages from the essays in The Life of Poetry and offer their
responses to the work, to Rukeyser's contribution to literature, and to the
integration of art into everyday life. This event will also celebrate the
10th anniversary of Paris Press. Co-sponsored by PEN American Center, The
Academy of American Poets, PSA, Poets & Writers, Poets House, Poetry, and
Bloom.=20

Sergey Gandlevsky & Franck Andr=E9 Jamme
An underground poet during the Soviet seventies and eighties who has
survived the Soviet regime, alcoholism, the asylum, and a life-threatening
brain tumor, Sergey Gandlevsky has emerged as a major figure in the Russian
literary scene.  Winner of both the Little Booker Prize and the Anti-Booker
Prize in 1996 for his poetry and prose, Gandlevsky is the author of numerou=
s
books of poems, a memoir, Trepanation of the Skull (1996); a book of essays=
,
Poetic Cuisine (1998); and a novel.  His books consistently are short-liste=
d
for the top Russian literary prizes.  His work has been translated into
English in A Kindred Orphanhood: Selected Poems of Sergey Gandlevsky (Zephy=
r
Press), by Philip Metres. Gandlevsky=B9s poetry melds a slangy vernacular wit=
h
traditional forms and meters to create what one poet has termed the
=B3explosive cocktail=B2 of Gandlevsky=B9s verse. His poems document the
underground life of a bohemian traveler and debauchee during the twilight o=
f
the Soviet regime with humor and world-weariness, formal severity and
sentimentality.  Translations will be read by Philip Metres. Franck Andr=E9
Jamme lives and works in Paris and Burgundy, France. Since 1981, he has
published thirteen volumes of poetry and fragments, such as Pour les
simples, La R=E9citation de l'oubli, Encore une attaque silencieuse and
Extraits de la vie des scarab=E9es (Fata Morgana, Melville, Flammarion), as
well as numerous limited editions illustrated by such artists as Suzan
Frecon, James Brown, Zao Wou-Ki, Acharya Vyakul, Jan Voss and Jaume Plensa,
among others. He has translated in French some poets, who are friends, such
as Lokenath Bhattacharya, Udayan Vajpeyi and John Ashbery, who translated
his work (John Ashbery translated The Recitation of Forgetting, Black Squar=
e
Editions). His poetry is included in The New French Poetry (Bloodaxe Books)
and The Yale Book of French Poetry (Yale University Press). In 2005 he was
awarded the "Grand Prix de Po=E9sie de la Soci=E9t=E9 des Gens de Lettres" for hi=
s
life's work.=20

consisting of 14 hours worth of video and audio. Subjects and
performers include: David Behrman, Philip Glass, Alvin Lucier, Gordon
Mumma, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, and Robert Ashley. Robert
Ashley says: Music with Roots in the Aether is a series of interviews
with seven composers who seemed to me when I conceived the piece-and
who still seem to me twenty-five years later-to be among the most
important, influential and active members of the so-called
avant-garde movement in American music, a movement that had its
origins in the work of and in the stories about composers who started
hearing things in a new way at least fifty years ago."

archive of Charlotte Moorman (1933-1991), containing hours worth of

Jonathan thanks for your thoughts about narcissism. I don't mean to sound
flippant, but my approach is to let others try to "define" it rather than
doing so myself. Gudding certainly did a lot of soul-searching to come up
with that characterization, and it was an important thing for him to get
that down in some systematic way. Yet, I tend to find the term, coming into
such wide circulation in the 20th century as part of a general therapeutic
model (Freud, etc.) that promises a way to solve the "disease" it diagnoses
(in ways that for many "replaced" but largely echo some Christian notions
of "sin" and "salvation"), tends to imply some ever elusive
"non-narcissistic" norm of "health" that generally is only defined
negatively, or defined in terms of conformity. At least that's how it's
often used. So I often question people who negatively judge others as
"narcissists"--because it seems they got "4 fingers pointing back at
themselves" in most cases.

Then, of course, there's the whole way the
term distorts and reduces the Narcissus story, which is way more suggestive
and provocative than the "clinical situation" or even than the grad-school
Lacanian mirror stage conundrum entanglement situation. I think it's way too
easy to say there's an "either/or" between "self-love" and love for another,
or others, and too often the clinical 20th century definitions play into
that. Sure, there's a kind of "you can't love others until you love
yourself" saying in circulation to---but then the way "self" is defined in
those terms can be somewhat dubious (like a more sophisticated version of a
parent yelling at a kid who is banging on drums, "Johnny that's not YOU"--)

Okay, just some loose (but hopefully suggestive) thoughts here; don't know
if it's of any help. No time to get too deep now. Chris

On Theatre Notes this week:

The Crucible

The Crucible by Arthur Miller. Directed by Anne Thompson and William
Henderson. The Eleventh Hour, 170 Leicester St, Fitzroy, until October 1.

It was not only the rise of McCarthyism that moved me, but something which
seemed much more weird and mysterious. It was the fact that a political,
objective, knowledgeable campaign from the far Right was capable of creating
not only a terror, but a new subjective reality, a veritable mystique which
was gradually assuming even a holy resonance...the astonishment was produced
by my knowledge, which I could not give up, that the terror in these people
was being knowingly planned and consciously engineered, and yet that all
they knew was terror. That so interior and subjective an emotion could have
been so manifestly created from without was a marvel to me. It underlies
every word in The Crucible.

Arthur Miller

Miller could be writing about contemporary America: a consciously engineered
terror which attains a "holy" mystique, where dissent against the ruling
powers attains the status of blasphemy. The Crucible premiered in the US in
1953, but its political insight strikes fresh sparks in the age of the
Global War on Terror (or GSAVE - the Global Struggle Against Violent
Extremism - for those who missed the changing of the acronyms).  If ever
there were a play for our times, The Crucible is it.

It also happens to be a personal favourite of mine. With Death of a Salesman
and A View from a Bridge ,The Crucible shows Miller at the height of his
dramatic powers, in fruitful agonistic struggle with theatrical aesthetic
and form.  He was not yet America's Great Playwright, and the urge to
didacticism - always strong in Miller - had not yet gained the upper hand.
Here is passion tempered by formal intelligence, ideological critique
informed by intuitions of human contradiction and frailty.  These plays
exemplify the very best of the American liberal tradition.

The timeliness of The Eleventh Hour's decision to stage Miller's masterpiece
(for it may be fairly called that, especially if, following Randall Jarrell,
one thinks of a masterpiece as a work of art with "something wrong with it")
is therefore praiseworthy. But it must be said that the company's treatment
of the text is utterly baffling.

In Sierra Leone artists are using their albums to protest about the way
their
country is being run. Can it make any difference?

The country is still recovering after 11 years of a brutal civil war.

 1Xtra's Rodney P returns to Africa after last performing there in 1993
to find out how rappers and musicians are helping to rebuild the nation.

 Here artists how best selling artists like Daddy Saj, Emerson and Jimmy
B are holding the government to account for their actions.

 Can Sierra Leone's fortunes change just from music?

Can music really influence politics? Are there any musicians that have
inspired you to get involved in campaigns? Which UK or US artists do you
think are putting out protest music that changes things?

Jonathan, Chris -- these are all good cautions, issues, questions. Yr
concerns have been repeated in other conversation on other lists by other
people. Mostly everyone seems to have gotten bothered by the label
"narcissist" and few are much concerned with the behavior that the post
described. The point you both make (I think) is that such a term can easily
be used as an Othering label. My post was less concerned with who can be
said to "have" narcissism and more concerned with how certain -- specific
-- writers, living and dead, purposefully DO certain harmful things, e.g.,
purposefully engage in, and seek out, contention -- encouraging others to
attack them, baiting one another -- policing their own self-image to the
point, e.g., of attacking people backchannel who happen to write poor
reviews of their work etc., posting news of themselves incessantly, etc.

I used the term narcissist because the above kinds of behavior seem (based
on my limited experience on the earth) to inhere in those people who are
not well capable of self-care. We often think "narcissism" is an overt
regard for one's self -- when in fact the phenomenon seems to happen in
people who can't take care fo themselves very well -- who either drink
heavily, commit substance abuse, have troubles with the truth, obsess about
whether others like them, etc.

So, yeah, I think we should embrace self-care -- if that's what you mean by
"embrace yr narcissism". Dogen, a favorite thinker of mine, says "We study
the Self to forget the Self." I think that's about right. I'm not
advocating some weird disregard of self. Just not freaking out when people
don't think highly of what you do -- which I see in writers in the past
and, unfortunately, some I happen to know.

When I wrote that email I had in mind some very specific people, a few
people alive now, actively writing in to blogs and listserves, and several
dead folk. I'm not really concerned with the application of the term beyond
the above. And I dont' really like the term myself. It was handy. Not out
to add a chapter to the Literary Supplement of the DSM-III.

Hi Alan,
         I sent you a footnote poem of my own, but I could only do it
with an attachment which I was reminded
The listserv doesn't accept. My email is w.curnow@auckland.ac.nz , so
let me know if you'd like me to back channel it?

Hi, folks,

For a talk I'm writing, I'd be interested to hear your
suggestions--mostly, though not exclusively, for work in the avant /
post-avant traditions--for post-WWII poems (or generic hybrids) that
incorporate footnotes or other apparatus into the text or in which the
text is constructed out of such apparatus.  Examples I'm working with so
far include work by Charles Olson, ED Dorn, Jack Spicer, Bob Perelman,
Brenda Hillman, Juliana Spahr, Brian Kim Stefans, Tyrone Wiliams, Jenny
Boully, Eileen Tabios, Barrett Watten, Paul Violi, Jena Osman, Armand
Schwerner, Charles Bernstein, Gabriel Gudding.  Front or back channel is
fine.

I won't be doing much with earlier examples in this mode (e.g., Dunciad
to Pound, Eliot, Moore), but if you think of some that are particularly
striking, well, I'd appreciate hearing of those too.

Thanks in advance,

Alan Golding

Subject:      Bill Lavender's Escape Narrative
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

[apologies if this was already posted & I somehow missed it]

from the Chronicle of Higer Ed, Poet Bill Lavender reports in:

NOTES FROM ACADEME
'We're Getting Out of Here'
Special report: The Gulf Coast's colleges begin to grasp the damage done


As told to JOHN GRAVOIS

Bill Lavender runs the Low Residency Creative Writing Program at the University
of New Orleans. His companion, Nancy Dixon, teaches in the university's English
department. Over a cellphone, Mr. Lavender described their journey out of the
city.

When we heard about the storm, we decided not to evacuate, because we really
didn't think our house was in grave danger. We live in Mid-City, which is a
part of New Orleans that's relatively high but not as high as the French
Quarter. It's an old house. It's been through plenty of hurricanes.

I guess the storm was at full force at midmorning on Monday. It never was really
that bad -- I actually put on my motorcycle helmet and walked around outside at
the height of it. We lost power, of course. We still had water, we still had
gas.

By about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the storm was over. There was a little bit
of water in the street, but nothing I couldn't have driven through. Our
reaction at that point was, Well, this wasn't really that bad.

If that had been all the storm was, I wouldn't have regretted staying.

At some point in there, the water did start to rise. It was rising in the full
sunshine, with no rain, just coming up in the streets.

Our neighbor across the street, who had evacuated, had a boat under her house --
a 14-foot light aluminum skiff with oarlocks and oars. As kind of a lark, I
went and pulled it out from under her house and put it in the street.

That night, Monday night, we went out on the front porch. There was absolutely
no light, and there was no noise, and the stars were fantastically clear.

We got up the next morning, and the water was higher. We were trying to listen
to the radio, trying to figure out what was going on. We were hearing that the
flooding on the east side of New Orleans was really bad. We were starting to
hear helicopters flying around.

There was a rumor that the levee was broken somewhere, but that they were going
to be fixing it, and that as soon as they got the levee fixed, they were going
to be able to pump the water out. I was thinking maybe the end of the week, at
the most.

One of my neighbors came to my door and said there was a guy around the corner
with a baby who needed to go to the hospital. The guy was scared to death of
water.

So we got in the boat, and we were rowing down the street, trying to pick the
best route to Mercy Hospital. There was water all the way -- right up to the
front door.

Some guy in scrubs got down in the water and helped me dock the boat there on
the steps. He was a paramedic who worked for the city. He said they had no
power in the hospital, and he had a generator down at his office. He wanted to
know if I could row him down there so he could get this generator.

And I asked him, "Doesn't the hospital have backup power?" He said, "Yeah, they
have a generator, but it's in the basement."

It was ludicrous, this notion of going to get a 5,000-watt generator to power a
hospital. But he said, "There are people dying in here, and it's all we can
do."

So we went to his paramedic station, a little two-story metal building. Two of
his colleagues were there.

This guy I'm with told them, "I've come to get the generator." And they told him
no. He said, "Look, there are people dying in Mercy."

"Well things are tough all over, and before this generator comes out of here,
I've got to get me and my dogs out."

At that point, I kind of exploded. I said, "You're not even using the generator.
The generator has nothing to do with your dogs." It kind of shamed them. We
finally did get the generator.

We had our last good meal that night. We were having wine on the front porch,
all the neighbors were out on their porches, and I got out my guitar and sang
"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall."

That night it was really hot and really still. There were helicopters messing
around all night. I had this idea they were either evacuating Mercy Hospital or
bringing them a generator. At one point they were so close that I could feel
the wind, so I took to praying for them to come over.


It wasn't until Wednesday that we started to get more information. There was a
press conference at 12. They said they thought the levee repairs would be done
by about Friday. Then they said they should have the water out of the city
within about 30 days. I said, "We're getting out of here. We can't live like
this for 30 days."

We packed up very hastily -- all our drinking water and a good bit of food. I
left my hard drive with 30 years of miscellaneous writings on it, plus Nancy's
hard drive with all her scholarship on it. I just tried to hide them in the
attic. I didn't know what else to do.

We had to put our cat in a carrying cage, and we put our dogs on the boat. We
went and got our neighbor, my friend Charlie Franklin. We told him what we'd
heard and we told him it's time to go. He thought about it for about two
minutes, and then said OK.

We were nervous. We knew there were no police. We'd been warned that there were
roving bands of armed looters. We knew that the boat was becoming a valuable
commodity. The dogs were nervous also. They would not let anyone approach
closer than about 10 feet from the boat. Charlie had a gun.

When we turned one corner, there was a kiddie pool floating in the middle of
Canal Street, and I could see a head sticking up over the side of it. There was
another guy pushing it and another guy wandering around in the chest-deep water
looking kind of dreamy. They were junkies that had looted the Rite Aid. They
were using this kiddie pool to get out of the water to shoot up.

A little further, there was a dead man in the water. Someone had hung his shirt
up on a street sign. I couldn't really see his face, but the shirt was sticking
up like a tent. We heard later they were tying corpses to street signs and
poles.

Across the street was a building called the City Hall Annex. It has a big front
porch that was just above water level, and it was full of people, maybe 150. On
one end, there were women and kids holding up signs saying, "Help us please."
At the other end of the porch there was this mad party going on. They were
breaking windows and throwing whiskey bottles around and kind of whooping and
yelling.

We were starting to get very careful about our route because we were getting
close to the Superdome, and we didn't want to get caught there. Our plan was to
go to the Macy's parking lot, which is just adjacent to the dome, where we had
parked our car. We were just praying that we might be able to get to the car
and drive out.

There were no cops. In this whole ride, we never saw a cop.

When we got to the Macy's parking lot, we saw that the entrance was four feet
deep. So we couldn't get our car. We followed the water to the corner of Girod
and Carondolet, and that's where the water ended. We had to abandon the boat.

So we started walking uptown, to go to my ex-wife's house, which we knew was
dry, and they had a generator and probably food and water. For all I knew, they
were still there, because I hadn't talked to them since Monday morning when the
phones went out.

We saw this two-story house with the facade completely removed. It was just like
a dollhouse. I could see the furniture and the bookshelves, everything neat,
nothing in disarray, and these two black labs up on the second floor looking
down at us.

After a while, a guy caught up with us. He told us he had walked all the way
from the lower Ninth Ward. I'm guessing that must be at least five miles. He
told us that down in the Ninth Ward he was literally wading through bodies on
the way out. He didn't know where any of his family was. He had a 3-year-old
and a 5-year-old kid, and he suspected that they were both dead. He was coming
uptown because he had a brother who was a butler in a Garden District mansion.

He told us that in the end there will be tens of thousands dead.

We got to my ex's house. We were just praying that we were going to see her
pickup outside the house. But there was nothing, and our hearts just sank. We'd
been on the road now for about four to five hours. We were exhausted.

Then I remembered that our friends lived just a few blocks away, and they had
left their car. Not only that, but I knew right where the key was. We got to
Alex and Kat's house, and the car was intact, and the key was in the mailbox.
But we couldn't make the key work in the door. I tried it and Charlie tried it,
and finally I said, "Charlie, move," and I threw a brick through the window.

We crammed all of us in the car. We drove to Tchoupitoulas Street and then
straight across the bridge to the West Bank, the only way out.

The next day, we were going to leave Charlie in Baton Rouge to take the bus to
Alexandria, but we found out that there were 200,000 people downtown trying to
get out. So we took him all the way to Alexandria. We started to have the
emotional breakdown. It was strange how, going through the whole thing, I just
sort of never stopped. None of us did.

But when we dropped Charlie off, all three of us broke down and started crying
and pretty much didn't stop for about three days.

Has anyone ever considered audio or video taping some of these  performances?
Is it too intrusive, too expensive, or simply to difficult to  chose which
readings are worthy? I can't afford a trip to NYC, but I surely  could afford a

Hi Mary

I know The Poetry Project records the events for its archives, but I don't
think the recordings are available to the general public. And I don't have
the equipment to make a recording of the event. If I did, I imagine I'd have
to clear it with The Poetry Project. I'd love to have a recording of the
event, myself, but it's not something I'll be able to do myelf.

I just received this kind house offer information from poet, Stefanie
Marlis, who lives in Patagonia, Arizona.


Patagonia (Arizona) wants to offer a family a place to live. This is a long
way from the Gulf Ghost, but an artistic town with me, Jim Harrison, Laura
Chester and other writers...If there is a writer with a family
out there who would want a leg up on a new start and you know who to send
this offer to, please do. A house, furniture, some start-up money...it would
need to be somebody who can work long distance.

Terry Quinn (4/1/05):
The Publishing of Poetry

What other branch of the Arts is as self defeating as Poetry? I can't
think of a method of publishing that is so guaranteed to bury good
poems and poets than that which exists in this country at present.
    Can you imagine any other enterprise, never mind just in the
Arts, where you're only allowed one shot at getting some form of
success. And yet there it it, usually in heavy black type at the
front of the publication 'Previously Unpublished Poems only'. Let's
take painting. I'm not altogether sure how it works in the Art world
but I've an artist friend who has exhibited his paintings all over
London. He'd be completely baffled (he was, because I asked him) if
he'd been told that no other Gallery would hang his work as he'd
already shown it somewhere else. Or a photograph published in one
magazine and never accepted elsewhere. How about music? Would a
composer accept the fact that because the CBSO has played his work
then no other orchestra would play it? Or a pop tune - played once on
Radio Cumbria never to be played on Radio One. I know the group would
sign for a label but that's like signing with an agent. The
playwright who has had his or her work performed at the Birmingham
Rep so the Royal Court won't look at it. Publishing novels at the
same time is on a different scale and economically wouldn't make
sense usually.
    Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that restricting the
method of publishing in the poetry magazines to previously
unpublished works has two consequences. The first and minor one is
that a lot of available space is filled by not very good poems. But
the second consequence is crucial and it is that a really good, maybe
great, poem might be published in a small magazine with a circulation
in the dozens and that's it. Virtually certain to be lost forever
unless spotted for an anthology and how likely is that? This is
crazy.
    So what's the alternative? Obviously there still has to be a
policy of printing new poems else it all stagnates but there must be
the freedom to publish poems already published. This would emulate
the pop charts at a crude level. So in my best of all possible worlds
a good poem would start to be published in lots of magazines all over
the country and would be spotted by all sorts of readers. From there
it would not be long before it would appear in anthologies which seem
to be the stock in trade of Waterstones or Ottakars or whatever and
then both readers of poetry and general readers would start to see
the best of current poetry rather than stuff that's good but highly
restrictive in origin. And it might well then encourage the general
reader to hunt out where these poems originated from i.e. the poetry
magazines.
    As a sort of experiment I tried to see how this would work in
practice with a friend who loves reading novels but not usually
poetry. I gave her a couple of poetry magazines to read through.
After a time her eyes seemed to glaze over. She reckoned they were
mostly a bit dull, a bit samey or she didn't understand them.
    I then gave her a copy of 'The Firebox' and the reaction was
different. She liked a fair few of them and got pleasure from them.
She liked the poems.
    The lesson is that good poetry works. This isn't about what is
'good'. That will take care of itself. The way it's published now is
stifling it at birth.

http://www.iotapoetry.co.uk/forum.htm

*

Within its 130 pages ENVOI hosts 48 poets with over 150 poems between
them, as well as reviewers Eddie Wainwright and Will Daunt. And there
is a cutting crie-de-coeur article by Terry Quinn, THE PUBLISHING OF
POETRY that should be printed, nay, blazoned on the forehead of every
poetry editor in the land. It is about the nonsensical notion that
lies behind the ridiculousness of the dreaded phrase, PREVIOUSLY
UNPUBLISHED POEMS ONLY. A practice that doesn't exist in other
branches of the creative arts. This practice leads to the facts that

a lot of available space is filled by not very good poems, and
a really good, maybe great, poem might be published in a small
magazine with a circulation in the dozens and that's it.
Virtually certain to be lost forever unless spotted for an anthology
and how likely is that? This is crazy.

Perhaps Roger Elkin could spearhead Quinn's idea. Reprint and send
this article to every poetry editor on the planet under the banner of
SAVE OUR POETS FROM STAGNATION.

Big Bridge accepts poetry whether it has been published or not.
We also accept simultaneous submissions.
The only request I make is that if you are in print in a current online
issue
that you not send us the same poem that is already on line but wait until it
is no longer simultaneously current
unless there is an explanation with it.
I also recommend that poets ignore any notices in any magazines that say
"Previously Unpublished Poems Only" or "No Simultaneous Submissions"
and I ignore them myself.

Woops! I have just lost my shot at fame! Goodbye cruel world...
Love, Michael

Catherine---
    Only browsed the piece, but I've been arguing that main beginning
point--about "PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED POEMS---for years.
    I agree with their diagnosis of the problem---
     would even go further and say it may even lead a poet,
     who wants to get "his/her name out there," to emphasize
     quality over quantity, or at least encourage it
     Their particular proposed solution I'm more skeptical about,
     but I'm glad others are thinking about this too...

September 15, 2005

Dear Friends,

We relaunched UbuWeb on September 14th with over 150 avant-garde
films in digital formats for your viewing pleasure. Within hours, we
received several hostile letters from representatives of filmmakers
-- all lawyers and business people, not the artists themselves --
issuing cease and desist letters and threatening lawsuits. Every
time, it seemed, we opened our inbox yet another appeared. We had
little choice but to obey and as a result, we have iced the section
-- for the time being.

We never intended UbuWeb to take any money out of the pockets of
these artists; rather we feel that simple exposure to even the most
degraded, corrupted, miniscule, and compressed .avi would increase
interest and exposure to avant-garde film, a field whose audience has
long been in decline. Our idea was to make accessible the generally
inaccessible, with the hopes that should you desire to see the film
in all its glory, you will make your way to the nearest theatre
showing them (although there are very few) or find better copies on
DVD. UbuWeb was never meant to be a substitute for the experience of
viewing a film; it was meant as a teaser, an appetizer, until you can
get to the real thing.

However, the real thing isn't very easy to get to. Most of us don't
live anywhere near theatres that show this kind of fare and very few
of us can afford the several hundred dollar rental fees, not to
mention the cumbersome equipment, to show these films. Thankfully,
there is the internet which allows you to get a whiff of these films
regardless of your geographical location.

Obviously, certain members of the film community did not share our
sentiments. They would rather keep these jewels to themselves or a
select few huddled in dark rooms.

One complaint read "Kenneth Anger is penniless and living in a shack,
yet you are making his films available for free and taking money away
from him?" To which we reply: if the current system of avant-garde
film distribution was working so well, why would the great artist
Kenneth Anger be living in a shack and not a mansion? Is this really
a system to hold on to? Obviously, something isn't working. If they
really cared about Kenneth Anger, they would hope to expose his
arguably-forgotten work to a non-geographically-specific digital
savvy audience via the radical distributive possibilities of
internet. Guaranteed, Mr. Anger would see his royalties soar as a
result.

UbuWeb doesn't charge money, nor does it make money, nor does it take
money. The idea that our efforts in any way would enrich ourselves is
preposterous. UbuWeb has been performing its version of community
service for ten years without making a penny.

We'll be back with our film section. Just give us some time to sort
through permissions, paperwork, and other sordid details. To be
continued...

All the best,
UbuWeb

Thanks Gabe.
Literally 2 seconds ago, I also was alerted to a write-up about my book at
Greg Delisle's blog at
http://www.poetryspace.org/2005/09/14/eileen_tabios_new_e-book

While referring to my book, Greg's point is not about my book but more about
the larger implications of Moria's ability to be a book publisher using
technology, and thus a means to get beyond the poem-as-commodity model.

Though I (and I believe others on this List) have benefited from the equally
visionary, uh, vision of Jukka-Pekka Kervinen as publisher who's also explored
POD technology, Moria is the first, for me, to concurrently offer a free
download option AND a hard copy for purchase model.

The structure may seem paradoxical but it actually offers maximum
flexibility.  Some of my readers wouldn't be able to afford the internet but can afford
one book.  And some of my readers (e.g. Mom) still won't go online.  So I'm
stepping behind the lurker-curtain for a mo to share this because I think the
structure offers a means for more poets who have considered becoming publishers
in the past but have been economically constrained.

Bill Allegrezza also alerts me that within a relatively few hours, over 60
people downloaded my book.  Ahadada Books, by the way, is also offering an
e-chap by me; in a matter of days, downloads exceeded 200.  As not just a
publishing poet but a publisher myself, I know how DIFFICULT it is to sell 60 let alone
200 copies of a book (unless it's being forced as an "assigned text" on a
student body somewhere).

So, here's a nod to those poet-publishers who've perservered to get poetry
beyond the economic  model's constraint (I also speak as a former economist).
It's important as I, for one, still consider Poetry a gift.
Best,
Eileen

How many will be from New Orleans? And how many will have stormy=
 personalities?
How many men will find women named Katrina more attractive, how many less?
Will they be called Kat for short or Trina or Na?

One thing's for sure: few hispanics will name their sons a masculine form=20
of the name, because catr=EDn in Spanish means "dandy," and who wants a kid=
=20
that wears spats?

And another sure thing: Roberts would bomb at a comedy club.

Recently a very heated debate has gone on in the experimental
film community mailing list (a parallel to this one, but not
academically sponsored).  Many issues were raised on both sides
of representation film in video or MPEG, of copyright
infringement and access, of language used to describe work, etc.
The resurrection of UbuWeb seemed to press a lot of those
questions to the fore.

This website is a fantastic community resource -- a research and
an *outreach* resource.  It started out as a source for concrete
poetry and out of print recordings, grew to include ebooks and
now film.  I welcomed then addition of film when it happend a
while back.

But in boldly moving into a new arena, the unveiling and quick
icing may have revealed latent differences between the poetry
community and the filmmaking community in relation to property
and livelihood.

Offering these films created a flashpoint that highlighted these
differences.  It made me curious if any similar launch has
occured and incurred the wrath of the poetry community's
publishers' lawyers, or were the selections of recordings,
ebooks, etc. more judicious in terms of vetting copyright
issues. It made me wonder how things would have gone if UbuWeb
had been in on those discussions among the filmmakers (though i
suspect at least one of the Board was).  Maybe not, and maybe it
doesn't matter.

Yet, is the poetry community inherently more able to support a
'gift economy' than the personal/experimental film community?
Maybe there is so little societal carrot to being an
experimental filmmaker (no Oscars or "Laureate") that perhaps we
resent any infringement, however harmless and/or well-meaning.
Maybe we're just control freaks! ("Sit in this chair and be in
my universe for x minutes.")  Maybe writers tolerate minor
infringements as a kind of advertising.  These questions matter
to me not out of some kind of wishful or imagined equivalence
between traditions or communities, but because writing,
performance, and cinema increasingly mingle, play off and
appropriate each other. They ought to get to know each other
better.

So i'm totally in accord with the Ubu project.  Being a
filmmaker i *want* more poets to see more experimental film, to
become conversant in its idioms, because i think what we are
doing speaks to the same values, formal concerns and even topics
that poets struggle with.  Interrogation of the IMAGE belongs to
both, effability and noise concerns both, commodification and
cliche are judgement criteria, while gendering, resistance and
identity representation are hot issues.  But what is it about
copyright that gets filmmakers' (or their "representative's" in
this case) panties in a twist?  What do some have to learn from
the poets, who'll let recordings of their readings or scans of
their work out for free on the net?

I don't really have answers to these, but maybe some of you do.
I just wanted to at least applaud UbuWeb in its home community
and encourage people to encourage them to get those works and
more back online, and for people to check them out, and come to
your own understanding.

Anyways, enough of this, i just got 2 emails about how to lose
those extra pounds and please 3 women in one night.  Gotta go.

Meantime, two very informative and enjoyable sites to check out
for your linguovisual pleasure are:

classed as 'cultural assets' belonging to the culture after a certain =
time
period, let's say ten years after publication/showing/sounding/. =
Teaching
institutions and libraries could then digitise their collections and =
make
them accessible on-line.

Present copyright laws stop us from archiving or preservation of =
cultural
assets in a form that can be searched and accessed on-line for teaching,
research and just plain enjoyment. So lots of valuable assets, audio , =
video
and film are literally rotting in library vaults, unable to be copied to
digital media because of copyright law.

If some sort of system of payment for download and copying to =
distributable
media could be conceived, then a tax on distributable media could be
collected by the government and distributed to publishers and artists on =
the
basis of downloads (Canada has a system like this I think).

|||
|||Recently a very heated debate has gone on in the experimental
|||film community mailing list (a parallel to this one, but not
|||academically sponsored).  Many issues were raised on both sides
|||of representation film in video or MPEG, of copyright
|||infringement and access, of language used to describe work, etc.
|||The resurrection of UbuWeb seemed to press a lot of those
|||questions to the fore.
|||
|||This website is a fantastic community resource -- a research and
|||an *outreach* resource.  It started out as a source for concrete
|||poetry and out of print recordings, grew to include ebooks and
|||now film.  I welcomed then addition of film when it happend a
|||while back.
|||
|||But in boldly moving into a new arena, the unveiling and quick
|||icing may have revealed latent differences between the poetry
|||community and the filmmaking community in relation to property
|||and livelihood.
|||
|||Offering these films created a flashpoint that highlighted these
|||differences.  It made me curious if any similar launch has
|||occured and incurred the wrath of the poetry community's
|||publishers' lawyers, or were the selections of recordings,
|||ebooks, etc. more judicious in terms of vetting copyright
|||issues. It made me wonder how things would have gone if UbuWeb
|||had been in on those discussions among the filmmakers (though i
|||suspect at least one of the Board was).  Maybe not, and maybe it
|||doesn't matter.
|||
|||Yet, is the poetry community inherently more able to support a
|||'gift economy' than the personal/experimental film community?
|||Maybe there is so little societal carrot to being an
|||experimental filmmaker (no Oscars or "Laureate") that perhaps we
|||resent any infringement, however harmless and/or well-meaning.
|||Maybe we're just control freaks! ("Sit in this chair and be in
|||my universe for x minutes.")  Maybe writers tolerate minor
|||infringements as a kind of advertising.  These questions matter
|||to me not out of some kind of wishful or imagined equivalence
|||between traditions or communities, but because writing,
|||performance, and cinema increasingly mingle, play off and
|||appropriate each other. They ought to get to know each other
|||better.
|||
|||So i'm totally in accord with the Ubu project.  Being a
|||filmmaker i *want* more poets to see more experimental film, to
|||become conversant in its idioms, because i think what we are
|||doing speaks to the same values, formal concerns and even topics
|||that poets struggle with.  Interrogation of the IMAGE belongs to
|||both, effability and noise concerns both, commodification and
|||cliche are judgement criteria, while gendering, resistance and
|||identity representation are hot issues.  But what is it about
|||copyright that gets filmmakers' (or their "representative's" in
|||this case) panties in a twist?  What do some have to learn from
|||the poets, who'll let recordings of their readings or scans of
|||their work out for free on the net?
|||
|||I don't really have answers to these, but maybe some of you do.
|||I just wanted to at least applaud UbuWeb in its home community
|||and encourage people to encourage them to get those works and
|||more back online, and for people to check them out, and come to
|||your own understanding.
|||
|||Anyways, enough of this, i just got 2 emails about how to lose

Subject:      Is poetry hypothetical?-An Open Letter
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
MIME-Version: 1.0

I am reading over an Economics exam a member of faculty at Towson Universit=
y put on Reserves and many of the questions begin thusly:=20

"If...", "Imagine...", "Suppose...", etc.

It is quite obvious that I am beginning to understand the nature of things =
in this world. One, that almost everything we do is arbitrary, or put more =
succinctly, everything that we do has its origin in arbitrary methods. Once=
 coming to standardization we accept them almost blindly. Is there anything=
 of arbitrariness in writing?

The "if" problem, the one I reckognize in these exams and arising in our da=
ily lives, is almost too perplexing to undertake, but so obviously easy to =
overcome! The age old question "why are we here?" resonates deeply in the q=
uestions of "if..." because things may come out of certain situations that =
do not readily exist, or may come to exist due to certain circumstances tha=
t exist now that may decide future's fate. Is there anything that exists be=
fore a text is written, in which it's cause could be found?

So asking "why are we here?" - the arbitrary measure of all thinking life -=
 can be akin to asking the question "what if we were existing?" which is no=
 longer arbitrary but necessary, a next step.=20

So, I am here, I guess, writing poetry, probably (let's take into considera=
tion here the gigantic footnote that is writing) and confused about its nec=
essity. Is poetry hypothetical?

I just consulted Sappho on her take on Narcissus and found the following
poem, which may or may not be for help to this discussion, but she does go
back a bit:=20

68.A

Since I am still home

    Convex by concave

The mirror within innocence

     Alexandra

Ignored and rough tender

Get a kick in the rear

Join no one:

Narcissus still virgin

Is awfully  - note him there

By the still pool =AD

                  Awfully cranky.

 from Sleeping with Sappho,
Translated by Stephen Vincent

WORD of MOUTH, the monthly reading series @ ARTS +
LITERATURE
LABORATORY welcomes two poets of Phylum Press: Cathy
Eisenhower & Anna Moschovakis.

September 16th, 7pm

Cathy Eisenhower grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, and now
works as a
librarian in Washington, D.C. She has published a
chapbook of poems, Language of the Dog-heads, with
Phylum Press, and her first full-length collection is
forthcoming from Edge Books.

Anna Moschovakis is a Brooklyn-based poet and
translator. She has
published translations of Henri Michaux, Claude Cahun,
Blaise Cendrars, Theophile Gautier and Elie Faure. Her
poetry has appeared in numerous publications including
Art New England, BOMB magazine, The Iowa Review, The
Poker, and Court Green and was included in the
anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes After September
11th (NYU Press). A pamphlet version of her serial
poem The Blue Book was released in 2005 by Phylum
Press, and her first full-length book of poems, I Have
Not Been Able to Get Through to Everyone, is
forthcoming in 2006. A Ph.D. candidate in Comparative
Literature at the CUNY Graduate Center, she currently
teaches Great Books and Modern Poetry at Queens
College. She is also an editor, designer
and letterpress printer at Ugly Duckling Presse, a
nonprofit art and publishing collective.

Phylum Press is an independent publisher of innovative
writing. Beginning in 2001, Phylum has published
chapbooks, pamphlets, and collaborations by such
writers as Peter Gizzi, Lynie Browne, Roberto Tejada,
Kristin Prevallet, Graham Foust, Lorraine Graham,
Susan Briante, Charles North, and others, working with
artists including Trevor Winkfield, Ariel Potter, Lara
Odell, and David Byrne. Reviews of Phylum publications

"Prairie poetry," as it came to be known in the 20th century, has found =
no more eloquent and accomplished a practitioner than Robert Kroetsch. =
Yet the North American prairie his work has made so recognizably visible =
in all of its characteristic particularities is changing profoundly in =
the 21st century. This change is marked by the transition of a cultural =
identity primarily rooted in place, to one that is rooted in a rapidly =
fragmenting, urbanizing, technology-based globalization. In an opening =
dialogue between the archetypal practitioner of this poetics of place, =
Robert Kroetsch, and a new practitioner of a poetics of the search for =
the often sublimated sign, Jon Paul Fiorentino, the reader bears witness =
to a rare literary event-a master passing on his legacy to the students =
who have become his peers-the transition from the unifying classic =
articulation of place to the diaspora of the vernaculars it has =
engendered.

All power to Mr. Gangopadhay!  I lived in India for three years in the early 1970's and am well aware that there are as many religious fanatics there as there are here.  This posting made me laugh when I read it, however.  Perhaps because I didn't know India's fanatics were litigious as well.  The author says that he's not taking this problem seriously.  If only we had the same luxury in the United States about our own religious nuts, some of whom at least seem to be running things here.

Nicholas Karavatos <nicholas@MCBS.EDU.OM> wrote:Trial of poet for 'defiling idol'
By Subir Bhaumik
BBC News, Calcutta


An Indian court has ordered a leading Bengali poet to stand trial on
charges of defiling a Hindu goddess.

The court in India's West Bengal state was ruling on a lawsuit filed
against Sunil Gangopadhyay by an ex-policeman.

In an article in Bengal's biggest newspaper this year, Mr Gangopadhyay
was quoted as saying he was "sexually aroused" by an idol of Saraswati.

Retired policeman Bhibhuti Bhusan Nandy filed a lawsuit saying the
comments had hurt his religious sentiments.

Additional chief judicial magistrate in Calcutta's Alipore court, Manjit
Singh, ordered Mr Gangopadhyay to appear in court on 3 December.

The court also ordered legal proceedings against three others - Aveek
Kumar Sarkar, editor of the Anandabazar Patrika newspaper, its publisher
Bijit Kumar Basu, and chief executive Subir Mitra.

'Zealots'

Mr Gangopadhyay, 71, was quoted in Anandabazar as saying he had kissed
an idol of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, to satisfy his
desire.

Mr Nandy, who has retired as the chief of the paramilitary Indo-Tibetan
Border Police, filed a formal complaint with the police against the
author.

"I am delighted the court has started appropriate legal proceedings," Mr
Nandy said.

Mr Gangopadhyay told the BBC on Monday that he was not taking the case
seriously.

"Some religious zealots are playing this up - mine was a light-hearted
remark on Goddess Saraswati. Her idol did not evoke devotion in me when
I was young. I found her very attractive and that is what I said," said
Mr Gangopadhyay.

"In Bengal, Hindus are known to crack jokes at the expense of their gods
and goddesses and that's what I did," he said.

"I have done no wrong but the zealots are trying to attack me because I
am so critical of them. I am not afraid of them - as a writer I have the
freedom to say such things and I and my publisher will fight it out in
court."

Controversy

Mr Gangopadhyay is West Bengal's best known living poet and novelist
with more than 250 books to his name.

But he is no stranger to controversy.

Two years ago, there were protests outside a newspaper office in
Calcutta after he wrote about the sex life of Indian spiritual leader,
Ramakrishna Paramhansa.

He also described Kali, the Hindu goddess of power, as a "tribal whore",
triggering protests by Santhal tribes people and Hindus.

Last year, the Bangladesh government banned an issue of an Indian
magazine which carried a story by Mr Gangopadhyay in which he wrote
about the sex life of the Prophet Mohammad.

I was told by an editor once that this problem with simultaneous publication has something to do with copyright.  I'm not saying this is correct; it's just what I was told.  Now, I too often ignore it except when, in a rare instance, I know it matters to a particular editor and there is a reason for this concern such as the one I mentioned above.

Hi Stephen,
 I was wondering and am asking since you might know having spent so much=20
time on Sappho, what is meant by _cranky_
here are some synonyms:
eccentric, erratic, bizarre, unpredictable, tortuous, crazy, imbecile-
 thus from positive to negative nuances.=20
From the text the advice Sappho is giving Alexandra is to join no one, thus=
=20
Narcissus should be a positive example. (?)
 Thank you, Anny

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I  think Space Man would be a very good career for Bush. I'd even go to Cape
Canaveral for the launch. But do we have to wait for him to decide? Can't we
elect him Space Man and have the government launch him with its remaining
funds?

New York, NY - In response to the national tragedy in New Orleans, Arts
for Art, in collaboration with the Angel Orensanz Foundation has
organized an all-star gala of jazz and creative music to benefit relief
efforts.
Legends of the Jazz and Creative music scene have come together donating
their time and talents to raise money for the artist, victims of the New
Orleans tragedy.

We are pleased to include special performances from Kidd Jordan, and
Clyde Kerr ­musicians from the New Orleans area who were affected by the
tragedy, but were lucky to make it out of the area safely. We invite all
to come out, enjoy wonderful music and donate to an essential cause.

Many people have come together to donate their time, energy, and various
resources to make this concert possible, from the musicians¹ talents to
the soundman¹s microphones to the piece of paper on which you are reading
this announcement. All money raised will go to organizations that are
helping the musicians and artists of New Orleans rebuild their lives.

I am interested in initiating a discussion on print on demand.
Not downloadable e-Books but books printed on paper, by a publisher, for
limited copy print runs from 1 - 100 or 1000.

Recently my publisher started making my collection of poetry, 'komninos =
by
the kupful', available as a print-on-demand publication.
The book is on an english syllabus and in limited demand.

This is great you will say, the advantages are many.
A book that has had a life as a print publication (1995, UQP) can be =
made
available long after it has disappeared from the warehouses.
Royalties flow again.
A book may never go out of print again.

But did I sign a digital publishing contract with my publisher when i =
signed
the original contract in 1995?
Was i asked to enter into a new contract for print-on-demand publishing,
were new contracts presented for signing?

What am i complaining about you might say, my book is in circulation and =
i
am receiving royalties?

True, but.

Print contracts were signed on the basis of print-run and =
advance-on-sales.
Writers depended on advances for books.

How long will it be before contracts are signed for print-on-demand
publication only? In the past publishers owned copyright of a book until =
the
print-run was sold out, and new contracts were issued for second and
consequent re-printings, if not already specified in the original =
contract.
Eventually the copyright would revert to the author once the publisher =
had
no further intentions to publish.
Contracts were time-based (time being measured by how long it took to =
sell.)
P-O-D publishing would not be time-based, publishers securing the rights
forever.
What kind of advances are authors likely to get from such a contract? =
None i
suspect, since it would be difficult to predict sales.

Obviously the business models and relationships between author, =
publisher
and book-seller are changing.

I'd like to hear other people's experiences of new publishing models.

Murat, you mention two concerns. I'll try my hand at a response to both,
tho I'm sure i'll just wind up exposing my own ignorance and prejudices.
Always a joy to have an excuse to do that though!

1. You ask why don't younger gen poets find Ginsberg significantly
appealing. Not sure if that's so, but I can say why he doesn't flip my
burger. I think one of the unfortunate & fascinating things about G was his
adherence to the Cult of Genius, whether Blake's, or (indeed what he
considered) his own. He actually believe that a poet was a "special being"
-- the only sort of being capable of uttering precious speech. This strikes
me as profoundly adolescent. I mean, one need only look at his Lannan video
or any number of his interviews or indeed his poetry itself, to see that
his aesthetic and politics were of a ridiculously romantic nature. They
amount to a kind of psychological exceptionalism: I'm a poet, poets are
great, I am a great being, the world needs me and my talents.  I mean,
ultimately what the cult of genius gets you is (1) an emotional monologist,
(2) the failure of the need to involve oneself in the disciplined care of
the self, a stand-off-ish and cynical relation to the Social -- all because
one is merely this emotional functionary, "legislating" for the world
unassailably on the throne of aesthetic and emotional grandstanding. I
think that's how a lot of folks -- maybe erroneously -- see him.

I wonder if when a poet writes to, from or for the cult of genius, the
ideal of genius, she or he doesn't also run the risk of becoming
unresponsive to the age, an audience, and indeed one's self. Ginsberg seems
to me sometimes (tho not always) a tad gassy.

2. In yr post below, you cast psychological discourse as a means of
"explain[ing] away ethical, political issues, even questions concerning the
soul." I'm not sure if you got this from my posts. If so, I should have
been clearer. I don't see it that way at all; rather, seems to me there's a
clear connection between, as the great sociologist C. Wright Mills had it,
"personal troubles" and "public issues." So, unlike you, I don't see any
reason to separate, or to see as separate, psychology and literature. You
say, "Psychology and literature to do not mix." Not sure exactly what you
mean by that formulation, but it sounds rather belletristic to me. I would
imagine it was only recently, in the last 150 years, that these discourses
were considered separate, issues concerning the soul and mind slowly
becoming the provenance of a professional community regulated as much by
Power and prestige as it was by truth claims and pragmatic therapies
designed to actually help people.  I can think of many "literary" texts --
Greek, German, Roman, British, Indian, American -- concerned with the care
of the soul and the care of the mind (or complaints thereof). [Ovid's The
Art of Love, many works of Novalis, etc etc -- and I find Gertrude Stein's
work, especially HOW TO WRITE, to be profoundly meditative, psychologically
invigorating, inducing profoundly calm states of mind, etc, I cd go on but
amn't sure precisely what you mean). Even: "I have see the best minds of my
generation destroyed by madness" etc etc.] And I have many "psychological"
texts that read more like poetry or great literary prose than "psychology"
texts (eg, "The Dhammapada" (the Buddha's poems about the liberation of the
mind); the "Mahasatipatthana Sutta" (about the cultivation of disciplined
awareness) or "Cultivating Inner Peace" by psychiatrist Paul R. Fleischman).

Lemme know if any of this is way of base. Maybe I'm just not getting you.

In Canada, the Beats are popular among young poets, particularly downtown
ones. For several reasons. They were into not only print poetry but film,
recording, music, etc. Some of them such as Ginsberg were prominent
protesters against the Vietnam war. They were unapologetically and vocally
in opposition to the forces of dullness. They were less wine and cheese than
many a literary thang. They kept the wine, ditched the cheese, and courted
youth. The 'first thought best thought' disregard of endless revision was
bold and action-oriented. They were consequential in the culture, not
ineffectual.

I read many of them but it was only Burroughs who helped me much in pursuit
of my own folly. I admire many of them, though, for their enduring
romanticism, ebullience, and committment to live intensely and with
conscience. Romanticism as a youth is one thing; when something of it is
retained later in life, as Ginsberg seems to have done, it is transformed
through pain and pleasure to something like enduring vigor.

Gabe,

Personally, I think the poet is a "special being" and I buy into the divine
nature of the poet, and the idealized romantic perspective. I am adolescent,
for sure. I was probably born that way. But there is a certain naive
intrigue that comes with being new in the world and discovering its
mysteries. Even the reporter, the troubadour is on a special magical
mission, ecstatic and maybe gassy. Maybe I will regret saying this, but no
matter how I try to deflate my view of poets, poetry, art, make them
socially everyday and common, and no matter how stoic and removed I try to
be about my fascination with the world, I will always end up wide-eyed and
euphoric. And it will be the magic of the poet that will amaze me and not
their sensible constraint. Goodness is not the question here, or rightness,
but integrity. I'm sure there is a medicine for this, but I don't believe I
want to take it. I don't want to be drunk and in despair, I just want to be
mesmerized by the new, and be out of my head with passion, without having to
take too much Valium. Mindfulness is not as bad as mindlessness but it can
be. As Philip Whalen said, "The further a religion gets from the source the
weirder it gets." And so we see the drive to become stable, mindful,
focused, generous, humble, whatever is correct, when you get to this country
you end up with austere puritanism, Zen Calvinism. I fear that is happening
these days, and so I prefer to err on the side of Idealism, romantic
idealism, or "The Cult of Genius", though I really wouldn't subscribe to any
of these terms and turns. There is a Buddhism that idealistically in a way
states that we stick around and make a better world, and then we can be
enlightened some other time. The Boddhisatva Way is from some perspectives
really a kind of idealism. I know there are buddhists that will tell me I
don't know what I am talking about here. But I am not a philosopher or
theologist, so I permit myself to make gross statements. Another thing PW
said was, "Be careful of the scaffolding." Ultimately, I don't care for it.
I hope you know Gabe, that I am not being arbitrary or trying to target you
or your perceptions in any personal way. I only argue for release. Or as
Chris suggested, we "embrace our narcissum." I am not a Buddhist nor tantric
in any retentive way. I think Ginsberg did a very good job turning people on
to poetry, and he did speak for many, nationally and internationally. His
actions spoke of freedom and his words assailed the injustices that he saw
in the world around him. Whether it got him into the papers, or what, that
was good. Political activism is a strategy and it involves exploiting the
press. Ginsberg was a good teacher and he operated in a culture that
fostered new leaders and rock stars. The press was becoming a field of rock
stars when Ginsberg was becoming a rock star. It is important to remember
that when Ginsberg became a "legend", Bob Dylan became a "legend", Mohammed
Ali became a "legend", everyone who was in the right place at that time,
prominent in all kinds of fields of endeavor, became "legends."  It was a
time of transformation around "pop culture." Once industry became aware of
the power of pop culture, and how they could monopolize the industries of
these endeavors, they went ahead and did it, they made legends, it sold
newspapers, music, books, anything that could be sold. The Music Industry
centralized, as did the Boxing Industry, and all kinds of sports, the whole
Entertainment Industry became an industrial complex. It was a perfect time a
Ginsberg. He was as much a product of the age as he was a product of his own
making. There needs to be more social and historical context here in this
discussion to explain the dilemma of THE BEATS, and Ginsberg, and the power
of Romanticism in the 21st century. Mind you, this may be my first ever, and
last, listserve rant. I am not quite myself these days and will try to
refrain from this kind of thing in the future.

Best, Michael

Thanks Jim, and Michael (I enjoyed that rant)

I've been thinking myself that Romanticism is Back, and in a big way.  All
the young people I know are deeply Romantic. They are not young American
poets, I suppose... Of course it's a different kind from Shelley's, and
stems from a different kind of politics, ecopolitics being pretty prominent.
But maybe its first virtue is that vitality.  It's exciting, affirming,
critical, sharp.  It's full of useful tools for understanding the world in
relation to the self. It deeply links politics and aesthetics and ethics.
It's energised by a real idea of freedom. Etc. I have never understood why
it has been a pejorative term, unless everyone's following Eliot; but Eliot
was, after all, deeply Romantic himself.

Btw, Murat, I do think literature is as historically and geographically
located as any other human activity.  It just does something different with
boundaries.

komninos--

Usually we have a first press run of 1000-1500, with the exception of
few titles bizarre enough as to have little hope of selling more than a
few hundred copies, but I have used POD for reprints, just finishing one
now in fact. We have a stipulation in our first contract that allows us
to reach an agreement before the book reaches an out of print status.
Standard royalty, 10%, in copies, cash or mix of the two. We pay this
out the same way we do for the first printing, half up front, half when
500 copies are sold. The author is told of the impending out of print
status when there is less than 100 copies left so we have the time to
agree and make changes.

If this is a poetry title, advances are almost never given except in
copies. It sounds like in your case they reprinted the book but are
paying you yearly by the number of copies sold? That part wasn't clear.

Be well

i think of poetry as holding intensest engagement with language. intensest
can sometimes just be honest and alive. that it be possible, though,
intensities, in language--that's special. freedom beyond being a breakfast
food. freedom to say/write/record the damnedest things.

David greetings
I wasn't wanting to criticise publishers, or my publisher in particular,
just that we are dealing with new ways of thinking here, with contracts
signed by old standards, and with new contracts signed.

All i'm asking is who is making the decisions, who is doing the thinking,
planning and lobbying about it?
Has anybody yet signed a POD-only contract(ie no prior print publication)?
Is there any mention of time or quantity?
Or is it assumed the publisher can publish on demand indefinitely?
Do POD contracts demand exclusive rights?
Can authors have the same book published-on-demand with more than one
publisher?


Cheers

But this merely admiration of the pose instead of the poetry. By this
standard there's nothing to choose between any poets but their skill in PR,
in getting to be "a legend"; in being perceived for "their enduring
romanticism, ebullience, and commitment to live intensely and with
conscience". You need not write poetry, or write at all, to live that way.
If it is the way they live that is admirable, what's the justification for
calling them "poets", since what they write, or even whether they write,
seems to have no necessary connection to how they live, and it is how they
live that you admire?

This, too, though, is a claim that it is the pose that is important, not the
poems; that what is essential or crucial is how one is perceived in the
culture, not whether one writes good poems. To a large extent, this
pose-not-poems approach is exactly what enables the commercial world to
exploit the images of "legends" to sell product, because it means that the
commercial world doesn't have to worry about whether the poems are good or
not - all it has to worry about is something a good deal more measurable:
whether the brand is recognizable. Then they can use the Ginsberg Brand or
the Ali Brand or whatever brand to sell their stuff. It is just the
groupie-like infatuation ("I'm with the brand") with the pose, the look, the
idealized life-style, that first creates and then sustains the
commercialization of the poet. Put the Ginsberg Brand on it, and you'll buy
it?

Once again, an admiration of pose, not poems, though, isn't it? Poetry is
rhetoric, a way of writing, not a personality type or a commercial brand or
an artful, or even passionate, pose. The notion that one can be a poet by
posing as a poet instead of by writing poems is pernicious, and teachers who
encourage it are not doing their students, themselves, nor the notion of
poetry itself any good. Shouldn't these young people who are more interested
in freedom and ethics than in writing poems be encouraged to go into
politics, where they might do some good in promoting freedom and ethics,
instead of posing as poets? Romanticism is sometimes used pejoratively
because it often appears to be nothing more than a way to pose as an
impassioned promoter of freedom from ethics rather than to embrace the
ethics of freedom.

Is that all? Freedom conceived as a negative thing, as a lack of impulse
control, instead of as a positive thing? What sort of ethics grows out of
lack of impulse control? What sort of life grows out of the ethics of lack
of impulse control? What sort of poetry grows out a life that grows out of
the ethics of lack of impulse control?

Stanley Burnshaw, Poet, Editor and Critic, Dies at 99
By DOUGLAS MARTIN

Stanley Burnshaw, a consummate man of letters who was not only a
poet, critic, translator, editor, publisher and novelist, but also
skilled at setting type by hand, died yesterday on Martha's Vineyard.
He was 99.

Susan Copen Oken, his wife, confirmed his death.

Mr. Burnshaw roamed the peaks of the literary world, famously dueling
with Wallace Stevens over poetry and politics; publishing and editing
work by his friend Robert Frost; writing a biography of Frost; and
publishing important books by Lionel Trilling.

His own creative career spanned more than 70 years: five of his poems
were published in 1927 in "The American Caravan: A Yearbook of
American Literature," of which Lewis Mumford was an editor, and he
published his final book, a poetry anthology, in 2002.

"No one moved so widely and so well in so many avenues of literary
creation and production," Thomas F. Staley, director of the Harry
Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at
Austin, said in an interview yesterday.

Morris Dickstein, the literary critic and English professor at the
Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said the
strongest continuous thread in Mr. Burnshaw's intellectual journey
was poetry. Mr. Burnshaw's 1970 book, "The Seamless Web," which
probed the origins of poetic creativity, is probably his best known.

"His extraordinary literary sensibility centers in poetry," Mr.
Dickstein said in an interview yesterday.

Stanley Burnshaw was born in Manhattan on June 20, 1906, to Eastern
European immigrants. His father was a star student at Columbia but
gave up an intellectual career to establish an orphanage in
Westchester County in 1912. His goal was to turn the children into
Renaissance men and women, and his son was a beneficiary of his
intellectually rigorous experiment.

Mr. Burnshaw graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1925,
then worked in advertising for a steel mill. He published a little
magazine, Poetry Folio, and set type by hand. In 1927, he went to
France to study, and became acquainted with the poet André Spire.

His first book was "André Spire and His Poetry" (1933), in which he
explained Spire's innovative free verse. Eda Lou Walton, writing in
The New York Times, called his study "one of the very few intelligent
analyses" of this style of poetry in English.

Between the trip and the book, he returned to advertising and also
earned a master's degree from Cornell. Unable to find a teaching job,
he became an editor at The New Masses, a Communist weekly.

In 1935, he reviewed Wallace Stevens's "Ideas of Order" for the
magazine, describing Stevens as "a man who, having lost his footing,
now scrambles to stand up and keep his balance."

Stevens, who was trying to respond to the social breakdown of the
Depression, was enraged to be attacked on political grounds, and
responded with a poem titled "Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue." (Mr.
Burnshaw replied 25 years later in The Sewanee Review.)

Mr. Burnshaw then wrote two stridently leftist works, one a book of
poems and the other a verse play exploring the effects of technology
distorted by greed. He was never actually a member of the Communist
Party, and his rejection of Marxism as a solution to society's
problems was signaled in 1945 with "The Revolt of the Cats in
Paradise," a book-length prose poem.

In the late 1930's, Mr. Burnshaw became editor-in-chief of the Cordon
Company, a publishing house, and then president of his own house,
Dryden Press, which merged with Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1958. He
stayed on with Holt and edited Frost's final works.

Mr. Burnshaw recruited Trilling to speak at Frost's 85th-birthday
celebration in 1959, a speech remembered for inspiring darker, more
pessimistic interpretations of Frost's vision. Mr. Burnshaw also
wrote "Robert Frost Himself" (1986), a biography many reviewers
considered more balanced than some previous ones.

Mr. Burnshaw's own poetry drew high praise. James Dickey wrote in The
Times Book Review that "Caged in an Animal's Mind" (1963) "fused the
European daring and total surrender to the unconscious - call it
imagination or something less."

"The Seamless Web," his book on poetics, the art and craft of
creating and comprehending poetry, argued that the poetry experience
was primal, almost biological. John Leonard applauded his gentle
approach in The Times.

"The man has written an important, challenging, exciting book,
without ever asking us to admire him," he wrote. "He is all the more
admirable for his reticence."

In his 1960 book, "The Poem Itself: Forty-five Modern Poets in New
Presentation," Mr. Burnshaw offered a new way to look at poems in
another language. Each of the poems (all were from Europe or South
America) was printed in its original language and followed by a
line-by-line translation and an analysis of its construction. In
effect, the book was a do-it-yourself translation kit. In 1965, he
did a similar book on modern Hebrew poems.

In 1981, Mr. Burnshaw published "The Refusers," a trilogy of novels
about what he saw as the paradox of Judaism: "the seeming
impossibility of belief in a just God of history and its necessity."

In addition to his wife, Mr. Burnshaw is survived by his daughter,
Valerie Razavi of Manhattan, and a grandson.

Professor Staley said that Mr. Burnshaw was one of the first poets to
write poems about the environment, and that he never stopped. At the
beginning of his career, he reasoned that Communists would not hurt
the earth to make a profit. At the end, taking better care of nature
fit in with his writings about poetry as a living thing.

"End of the Flower-World," a poem Mr. Burnshaw wrote in 1924 when he
was 19, ends with this stanza:

Fear no more for trees, but mourn instead

The children of these strange, sad men: their hearts

Will hear no music but the song of death.

Thank you, Anny, for all this.

Derrida's terms "hospitable narcissism, comprehensive, generous, open,
extended" are perfect. Your wonderful site reflects* this attitude. I don't  have a
copy of Michael's book, but I have read these two poems, The  Responsibility
of Flowers and Goodbye Narcissus:

_http://www.book.co.nz/rothen.htm_ (http://www.book.co.nz/rothen.htm)

My experience* with the flower is at our little park's pond, where I spend
many hours in creative reflection and recognition of our similarities and
differences, the agony and the ecstasy.

welcoming, hospitable narcissism, one that is  much more open to the
experience of the other as other. I believe that  without a movement of
narcissistic reappropriation, the relation to the  other would be absolutedly
destroyed, it would be destroyed in advance. The  relation to the other -
even if it remains asymmetrical, open, without  possible reappropriation -
must trace a movement of reappropriation in the  image of oneself for love to
be possible, for example. Love is narcissistic.  Beyond that, there are
little narcissisms, there are big narcissisms, and  there is death in the
end, which is the limit. Even in the experience - if  there is one - of
death, narcissism does not absolutely abdicate its power.

Something  like, respect your self and you will automatically be able to
accept the  other.
There are many people for whom this attitude does not mean  anything, by
whom selfishness is at home. As we know we are all similar but  also all
different.
Take care, Anny

I'm not sure why this is an issue. POD is just another way to print books.
The question of when a book becomes out of print and rights revert is no
different than with other forms of printing--pretty murky. Offset is
already cheap enough so that any publisher could run off a couple of
hundred copies to keep the rights to a valuable property, and some of the
uptown presses do this on occasion. And writers have always been able to
ask for special terms in contracts and publishers to accept or refuse those
terms. Contracts traditionally allow reprinting as the publisher sees fit
for as long as the publisher sees fit.

Junction Press, my imprint, used POD for the first time in producing its
most recent book, Gloria Gervitz' Migrations, translated by Mark Schafer.
We would have POD'd previous books, but we weren't yet sure of the quality
of the product. The intended print run remains our standard 1200 (with,
hopefully, more thereafter), just not all at once, which makes life a lot
easier. I should have another 300 copies by mid-October, in preparation for
a series of readings in NY, Boston and California. I don't see how this
affects the lives of author or translator. I also don't know why either
would want the book declared out of print if it's still selling.

All future Junction books for which I don't anticipate an immediate demand
of at least a thousand copies will be POD.

Answers to specific questions: "Has anybody yet signed a POD-only
contract(ie no prior print publication)?" Yes.
"Is there any mention of time or quantity?" An author can ask that
publisher's rights be limited in this way, and a publisher can accept or
refuse. Time--a committment as to when a final ms. is due and when a book
will be produced--and quantity--how large the first run will be--are
normaly specified in contracts. "Out of print" can be defined in the contract.
"Do POD contracts demand exclusive rights?" Usually, although a contract
can stipulate anything the parties agree to.
"Can authors have the same book published-on-demand with more than one
publisher?" Usually not. Why would any publisher agree to this? Although
publishers occasionally allow fancy limited editions of books they own the
rights to--but they usually expect to be paid something for the permission.
None of the above are specific to POD.

POD lowers publishers' risk, which means a book is more likely to get
published. In the old days (it must be thirty years now) publishers got a
tax write-off for warehoused unsold books. When that was disallowed a lot
of books got pulped (no royalties there), because it was cheaper than
storing them, or were sold at enormous discounts, usually at a loss to the
publisher, to mail-order houses or chains which would sell books dirt-cheap
(minimal royalties, if any) until they stopped selling enough to justify
storage.

Here are some real questions to ask: foreign rights? translation rights?
Permissions for the reprint of individual poems, as in anthologies? Again,
not exclusive to POD.

A more pressing issue is the status of books or poems published online.
Shearsman published an ebook of mine. We have no contract, and the
publisher thinks it would be fine if someone wants to do a hardcopy
edition. But there are no standards here. It's not even clear whether
publication in an ezine constitutes publication--some hardcopy journals
care, some don't.

Anny, great quote from Derrida, in opening up the possibilities of the myth=20
of Narcissus, besides the most immediate one of self-centeredness. For=20
instance, the myth contains the image of the mirror. By coincidence, I am no=
w reading=20
a book on Islamic painting -on the surface, a contradictory concept since=20
there is an injunction against visual representation. One way visual=20
represantation enters Islamic painting is through a fusion of a radical vers=
ion of Sufism=20
with shadow puppet plays, which exist from The Middle East to Indonesia. In=20
both the world is a mirror, reflecting as shadows God. In early miniatures a=
nd=20
book illuminations in Iraq (Abbasi period), figures appear as silhouettes,=20
shadowy caricatures "representing" events in poems.

The idea of mirror is also crucial in Eda, my anthology of contemporary=20
Turkish poetry. It permeates the texture of at least one third of the poems=20=
in the=20
book.

Narcissus
 takes
 narcotics
 in -
         a -
 glass -
 of
 water.         =20

("souljam," k=FC=E7=FCk Iskender)

"I believe that without a movement of
narcissistic reappropriation, the relation to the other would be absolutedly
destroyed, it would be destroyed in advance."

It is possible to regard the above words by Derrida as an parable for the=20
process of translation, how a translation must start with a misreading/break=
ing=20
down of the "other," which opens it up (I am aware how counter-intuitive tha=
t=20
idea sounds). The allure which creates that break is akin to love, as Derrid=
a=20
says.  =20

If one is interested in further ideas around Narcissus/Narcissism and=20
mirrors, there is the new book "Vigilance" by Benjamin Hollander, published=20=
a few=20
weeks ago by Beyond Baroque. It contains, besides Benjamin's fascinating poe=
m=20
which everyone should read, an essay, "Eleven Septembers Later: Readings of=20
Benjamin Hollander's Vigilance," which develops a concept called "film lumie=
re." In=20
unedited form the same essay will appear in the next issue of The New Review=
.

The ALTA publication, Translation Review from the University of Texas in=20
Dallas, just brought out a Turkish issue. My essay in it, "Turkey's Mysterio=

t
and Found Times, Moria, Miami Sun Post, Muse Apprentice Guild, Sidereality,

and Improvisations (Beneath the Underground), the now-completed work that h=
e
introduced in his 2001 reading at the Poetry Project. Frazer lives most of
the year in South Florida. David Antin is a  poet, performance artist, art
and literary critic internationally known for his "talk pieces" --
improvisational blends of comedy, story and social commentary. New
Directions has published three books of these "talk pieces" =AD Talking at th=
e

The Life of Poetry: A Tribute to Muriel Rukeyser
Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) is one of our country's most influential yet
neglected writers. She published fifteen collections of poetry, plays,
translations, children's books, and several works of nonfiction. Her
collection of essays The Life of Poetry was reprinted by Paris Press in
2005. Readers will include Eileen Myles, Martin Moran, Hortense Calisher,
Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, Eleanor Wilner, Marie Ponsot and other special
guests. Participants will honor Rukeyser's assertion that living with the
arts, especially poetry, helps us to respond to the world around us with al=
l
our senses, resisting numbness, apathy, and the paralysis of fear. They wil=
l
read passages from the essays in The Life of Poetry and offer their
responses to the work, to Rukeyser's contribution to literature, and to the
integration of art into everyday life. This event will also celebrate the
10th anniversary of Paris Press. Co-sponsored by PEN American Center, The
Academy of American Poets, PSA, Poets & Writers, Poets House, Poetry, and
Bloom.=20

Sergey Gandlevsky & Franck Andr=E9 Jamme
An underground poet during the Soviet seventies and eighties who has
survived the Soviet regime, alcoholism, the asylum, and a life-threatening
brain tumor, Sergey Gandlevsky has emerged as a major figure in the Russian
literary scene.  Winner of both the Little Booker Prize and the Anti-Booker
Prize in 1996 for his poetry and prose, Gandlevsky is the author of numerou=
s
books of poems, a memoir, Trepanation of the Skull (1996); a book of essays=
,
Poetic Cuisine (1998); and a novel.  His books consistently are short-liste=
d
for the top Russian literary prizes.  His work has been translated into
English in A Kindred Orphanhood: Selected Poems of Sergey Gandlevsky (Zephy=
r
Press), by Philip Metres. Gandlevsky=B9s poetry melds a slangy vernacular wit=
h
traditional forms and meters to create what one poet has termed the
=B3explosive cocktail=B2 of Gandlevsky=B9s verse. His poems document the
underground life of a bohemian traveler and debauchee during the twilight o=
f
the Soviet regime with humor and world-weariness, formal severity and
sentimentality.  Translations will be read by Philip Metres. Franck Andr=E9
Jamme lives and works in Paris and Burgundy, France. Since 1981, he has
published thirteen volumes of poetry and fragments, such as Pour les
simples, La R=E9citation de l'oubli, Encore une attaque silencieuse and
Extraits de la vie des scarab=E9es (Fata Morgana, Melville, Flammarion), as
well as numerous limited editions illustrated by such artists as Suzan
Frecon, James Brown, Zao Wou-Ki, Acharya Vyakul, Jan Voss and Jaume Plensa,
among others. He has translated in French some poets, who are friends, such
as Lokenath Bhattacharya, Udayan Vajpeyi and John Ashbery, who translated
his work (John Ashbery translated The Recitation of Forgetting, Black Squar=
e
Editions). His poetry is included in The New French Poetry (Bloodaxe Books)
and The Yale Book of French Poetry (Yale University Press). In 2005 he was
awarded the "Grand Prix de Po=E9sie de la Soci=E9t=E9 des Gens de Lettres" for hi=
s
life's work.=20

komninos--

Usually we have a first press run of 1000-1500, with the exception of
few titles bizarre enough as to have little hope of selling more than a
few hundred copies, but I have used POD for reprints, just finishing one
now in fact. We have a stipulation in our first contract that allows us
to reach an agreement before the book reaches an out of print status.
Standard royalty, 10%, in copies, cash or mix of the two. We pay this
out the same way we do for the first printing, half up front, half when
500 copies are sold. The author is told of the impending out of print
status when there is less than 100 copies left so we have the time to
agree and make changes.

If this is a poetry title, advances are almost never given except in
copies. It sounds like in your case they reprinted the book but are
paying you yearly by the number of copies sold? That part wasn't clear.

Be well

a very good resource for authors on POD-publishing.

What about book-sellers?
are POD-publishers becoming their own book-sellers and book-distributors?
I can't imagine after paying the extra cost of printing small print-runs,
that adding the cost of distribution and mark-up for book-sellers, the cost
would be enormous. The model can only work if publisher is POD-publisher,
distributor and book-seller.
What do book-sellers think of that?
Will book-sellers become PODpublishers?
Does anyone know if these things have happened already?

It seems that a reputable publisher's name is still required to give book
publications some sort of authenticity. Some sort of review process adds
value to the publication.

I suppose publishers are much better positioned to promote titles via
literary festivals, talk-shows, other media, book prizes, and their own
websites.

|||Standard royalty, 10%, in copies, cash or mix of the two. We pay this

|||500 copies are sold. The author is told of the impending out of print
|||status when there is less than 100 copies left so we have the time to
|||agree and make changes.
|||
|||If this is a poetry title, advances are almost never given except in

It is possible to admire what an artist represents without being
particularly interested in the poetry (or paintings or music etc). But
generally it doesn't reach such a stage without there being some body of
work on which the representation relies. So, yes, you need not write poetry,
but representation is something else, isn't it.

I read some of the poetry. And novels. Etc. But it was Burroughs's cut ups,
both in audio and in his trilogy of books, that were most useful to me. I
was producing literary radio at the time.

I don't know how many books of poetry Ginsberg published--lots. Some of them
are in bookstores around the world. Same with other of the Beats. Their work
*is* available, and read. Widely. Mostly by the young burning for language
that resonates amid music, film, and other arts and media and amid protest
against consumerism and militaristic capitalism.

That which is beyond the page is not all pr. Poetry is now a larger thing
than words on a page. But there's no shortage of po pr, is there, by the
Beats or others. Ginsberg studied marketing. All sorts of contrary elements
mixed together. Poet salesman no salesman etc. Antiestablishmentarianism
become some kind of Beat brand.

Weren't the Beats the first USA poets to tackle lots of media and arts
additional to poems on a page? And, at least in the case of Burroughs, in
quite an innovative way. His audio writing explores the cut and recorded
sound originally. He says 'when you cut tape, the future leaks out.' Their
influence is amazingly wide through film and music of their time (as in the
name of the Beatles, for instance). And that influence isn't *just* about
pose, but pose is what a lot of popular media respond to.

They were lucky in the sense that what was in them to do was able to
resonate so well in popular culture, and still does among the young. There's
many a poet doing fab work that never will resonate very well in popular
culture.

Dear Poetics List,
I'm a co-editor of an anthology of poetry by South Asians (Indian,
Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Bangladeshi) who are living and
working in the US.  The anthology, while compiled, is still in
pre-publication stage.  We're working diligently toward getting it out in
the world.  Like a few anthologies that have preceded it (e.g. Our Feet
Walk the Sky), we imagine that one function of the text is that it will be
utilized in the teaching of college courses in poetry and/or in Ethnic
Studies.  As much as we might have a good hunch about this, we thought it
important to survey writers and teachers of poetry.  So the questions are:

1.  Who teaches courses that would incorporate a text on South Asian poetry?
2.  Where, predominantly, are these courses being taught?
3.  Does this text have a personal relevance for you?  If so, why?

What we are looking for, if possible, is input from those of you in
academia who know of specific people and specific courses.  Any help is
much appreciated.

Thank you!
Summi Kaipa

the Cloister Café, 238 E. 9th Street
NYC

ABOUT THIS MONTH’S READERS

Katy Lederer is the author of the poetry collection,
Winter Sex (Verse Press, 2002) and the memoir Poker
Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers (Crown, 2003), which
Publishers Weekly included on its list of the Best
Nonfiction Books of 2003 and Esquire Magazine named
one of its eight Best Books of the Year 2003.  She
edits her own magazine, Explosive, and serves as a
Poetry Editor of Fence Magazine.  She currently lives
in Manhattan, where she works for a quantitative
trading firm. Samples of her poetry reside at
<www.typomag.com/issue6/lederer.html> and
<http://www.versepress.org/lederer.html>.

Ange Mlinko's second book, Starred Wire, won the
National Poetry Series in 2004 and is just out from
Coffee House Press. She is also the author of Matinees
(Zoland Books, 1999) and numerous articles on poetry.
From 2000-02 she edited The Poetry Project Newsletter.
She has taught at Brown University, Naropa University,

At 23, a poet and translator, Valzhyna Mort’s work has
been translated into many European languages and
published in various literary magazines and
anthologies, including an Anthology of Belarusian
Poetry (Sofia, 2002). She is famed throughout Europe
for her remarkable reading performances, which display
a talent not normally associated with one so young.
She is the winner of several poetry competitions in
Belarus, and in 2004 she received the Crystal of
Velenica Award in Slovenia, which is awarded for
reading performance. Valzhyna’s first collection, I’m
as Thin as Your Eyelashes (2005), is startlingly
assured and reveals a powerful poetic voice. She is
the 2005 recipient of the Gaude Polonia stipendium.
She currently lives in the United States.

 Valzhyna writes in Belarusian at a time when efforts
are being made to reestablish the traditional
language, after governmental attempts to absorb it
into the Russian language have been relinquished.  She
reads her poems aloud in both Belarusian and English.
Mort’s poetry is featured online at
<www.blueflowerarts.com/vmort.html>  and
<www.lyrikline
.org/en/list_languages.aspx?authorId=vm00>

Summi,

I teach at a college in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. It uses the American
system, is affiliated with Western universities & colleges, and has a
strong South Asian minority within the mostly Arab student body. The
workforce in this country is predominantly South Asian. And South Asian
students are among my best and brightest.

I have taught Arab-American literature here and used various anthologies
of Arab-American writing.

Given the opportunity, I would propose to teach a course in
SouthAsian-American literature. Given the historical relationship
between Gulf States and the Indian subcontinent, as well as the personal
& business relationships among people, I think such a course would be
well attended.

I also think universities in South Asia could be interested in this
focus of American literature.

The Humanities have been slow to develop within the burgeoning industry
of private colleges in the Gulf States. The case is also true in many
public universities. With a few exceptions, all students have one of two
majors: Business/Economics or Computer Science. They just don't have the
choice. There are students who have lamented to me that they don't want
to major in these subjects, but they have to or leave the country to
study. Even so, parents tend not to support degree/career paths in the
Humanities as not being financially secure.

Thus, literary study here seems always just a requirement to fulfill or
an elective. Either way, I think a course in SouthAsian-American writing
would be popular in this part of the world. Sorry I couldn't offer any
observations regarding North America.

Best,
Nick

It is possible to admire what an artist represents without being
particularly interested in the poetry (or paintings or music etc). But
generally it doesn't reach such a stage without there being some body of
work on which the representation relies. So, yes, you need not write poetry,
but representation is something else, isn't it.

I read some of the poetry. And novels. Etc. But it was Burroughs's cut ups,
both in audio and in his trilogy of books, that were most useful to me. I
was producing literary radio at the time.

I don't know how many books of poetry Ginsberg published--lots. Some of them
are in bookstores around the world. Same with other of the Beats. Their work
*is* available, and read. Widely. Mostly by the young burning for language
that resonates amid music, film, and other arts and media and amid protest
against consumerism and militaristic capitalism.

That which is beyond the page is not all pr. Poetry is now a larger thing
than words on a page. But there's no shortage of po pr, is there, by the
Beats or others. Ginsberg studied marketing. All sorts of contrary elements
mixed together. Poet salesman no salesman etc. Antiestablishmentarianism
become some kind of Beat brand.

Weren't the Beats the first USA poets to tackle lots of media and arts
additional to poems on a page? And, at least in the case of Burroughs, in
quite an innovative way. His audio writing explores the cut and recorded
sound originally. He says 'when you cut tape, the future leaks out.' Their
influence is amazingly wide through film and music of their time (as in the
name of the Beatles, for instance). And that influence isn't *just* about
pose, but pose is what a lot of popular media respond to.

They were lucky in the sense that what was in them to do was able to
resonate so well in popular culture, and still does among the young. There's
many a poet doing fab work that never will resonate very well in popular
culture.

"Or Paul Celan said that the poem was no different than a handshake. I
cannot see any basic difference between a handshake and a poem--is how
Rosmarie Waldrop translated his German. The handshake is our decided
ritual of both asserting (I am here) and handing over (here) a self to
another. Hence the poem is that--Here. I am here. This conflation of
the solidity of presence with the offering of this same presence
perhaps has everything to do with being alive."

Hip Hop: HKB Finn- Acoustic Afro Hip Hop


... I thought, I’d do one or two albums, probably get done in by MI5
(you know, dying from athletes foot or sneezing or the usual tying hands
behind my back and shooting myself in the face… it’s quite common) or
simply get killed by the BNP* for being a freethinking Blackman intent
on showing white youth that we can be defined collectively as humans and
not by our pigmentation. -- (ed notes: *"BNP" British National Party: a
recognized facist white power party in the UK. (recognized over the now
illegal muslims political parties thanks to blair -- who also forgives
and gives pardons to israeli war criminals)



HKB Finn- Acoustic Afro Hip Hop
September 9th, 2005

HKB Finn dabbles in all sorts. Poetry, acting, spoken word performance,
and of course rapping. You may have heard of the Son Records released
‘Vitalistics’, his debut solo album. He’s also released material as part
of the partnership ‘The Humble Beez Collective’, is working on an album
called ‘Confessions Of A Trouble Maker’, and has collaborated with
trumpeter Dominic Ntoumos and the UK producer Insane Macbeth.

Now come’s ‘Acousic Afro Hiphop’, an impressive twelve track album
produced entirely by Tunde Jegede, out on Alter Native Studios. This is
an earthy, rootsy, atmospheric gem with many interesting soundscapes to
explore and vocal tracks to digest. Certain to be appreciated by fans of
Ty, much of the music is instrument based and provides a stripped down
form of hip-hop which is very refreshing. The vocals and lyrics sound
just as refreshing though. It’s nice that for almost the entire album,
Finn sticks with his natural accent rather than flirt with any other.
The lyrics are all well crafted, offering a variety of topics much like
the music offers a variety of vibes.

Some of the tracks are more typical hip-hop affairs, with standard
format rap verses performed. Other tracks feature singing vocals and
there’s some almost acapella stuff for spoken word poetry to sit on.
Perhaps the possible downfall of the album in some people’s view will be
that they’re not used to simply sitting down and listening to a stretch
of computer, synthesiser and electronic free music. But the album is
accessible at all points and can be stopped in one place and started in
another if they prefer. In saying that, it’s also very impressive as one
singular unit of expression.

‘My Cup’ opens the album and sees Finn rhyme in a bouncy flow.
‘Confession (I Am)’ has a finger clicking, hands clapping beat with
assertive lyrics. ‘Miss A Rebel’ is a romantic number with a sweet flute
throughout. ‘Baby Love’ feels like the more contemporary, radio suitable
track of the bunch. ‘Eponymous (Anthem)’ has a cool chant of Finn’s
artist name and some really enjoyable light drum sounds. ‘Rhythm Is Our
Methods’ is pretty much an instrumental and suits its name. ‘Lifesaver’
has some emotive guitaring which Finn talks over. It features Maya
Jobarteh singing. On ‘Archetype’, Finn lays down some soulful vocals
that he sings himself. ‘What If?’ has the feel of a full live band.
‘Journey To The Inner’ is quite jazzy with a quite hard drum beat.

The artist is far from a newjack but don’t feel alienated if you don’t
know the backstory because this glimpse of his talents offers more than
enough to make you a fan, and will likely have you checking up the older
releases floating around. It’s classy, and all the more so because it’s
the output of an independant artist yet sounds no cheaper or less
enjoyable than something by someone with a juicy budget.

HKB Finn Interview

interview 0295 added 13.04.05 words: Nikesh technical: QED


http://www.ukhh.com/features/interviews/hkb_finn/

Bladow! He’s not just one of the guys from mid 90’s group, Katch 22,
he’s not just a labelmate with Def Tex and a hip-hop soldier from way
back. He is an intelligent soulful brother with oodles of information on
the history of African music and the connotations of slavery filtering
down through the ages into the information age. HKB Finn is a true-skool
rapper, an inspiration to listen to and an impeccable candidate for
interview. Heaven knows why we didn’t suggest this earlier.

He’s just released an album, “Acoustic Afro Hip-hop”, which sets the
scene perfectly for his blend of searing and uplifting lyrics, excellent
soulful, Afrobeat-esque production and spoken word griot rhythms, learnt
from the masters. HKB Finn has contributed to films, already is working
on his next album and has been awarded an honorary degree in music from
the University of East London. He’s probably also one of the first UK
rap artists to be gearing up to release a “Best of…” set.

This man is a pioneer. Nikesh caught up with him on a dreary South
London evening, to hear his words of wisdom and aspiration.

Introduce yourself to the UKHH.COM audience and tell us about your last
great adventure?

Greetings to one and all, this is HUNTKiLLBURY FiNN aka HKB FiNN. My
last great adventure was working with a legendary artist, a griot. For
those who don’t know, a griot is the keeper of history in oral culture.
He passes the history of his people through music and stories. Each
generation of griots reinterpret the same musical issues and stories for
themselves in order to remain relevant for their generation. The griot I
worked with is a legend in West Africa and his name is: Kasse Mady.
Working with an artist from this background was a great adventure
because, by working together, we’ve managed to complete a circle that
began with Africans leaving for the new world via slavery over 500 years
ago and being cut off from a part of our heritage.

As a pioneer of the UK rap scene, what are your thoughts on the scene in
2005? Who do you rate?

The current Hip Hop scene has so many amazingly talented musicians now.
To be honest they’re far too many that I personally rate. I really rate
new and established talents like: Blak Twang, Roots Manuva, Ty, Jehst,
Skinny etc, but I also dig new school Kats like: Doc Brown, Harry Love,
Estelle, C-Mone, YunGun, Tommy Evans… the list goes on. For me, trying
to say who’s banging in the UK is like asking me to count the hairs on
my forearm. I ain’t got the time bro…

What was the scene like when Katch 22 were around?

During the Katch 22 days, the scene was a bit like it is now: we all
had/have a sense of family. The scene is led by the US machine. A few
manz was/is still biting U.S. styles and palming themselves off as the
authentic thing. The only changes I see is, DJ’s don’t get props like
they used to, it’s all about the emcee now. We’ve got a lot more heads
prepared to put out and work their own tunes without big labels (who
ultimately are either too weak to beat the Yanks or they’re just an
American outpost set up here to siphon UK monies back to America to make
their music industry stronger while we all stand in the rain like
beggars to blood cleat). I believe, we actually make a better product
than most others, but we need to work on our marketing and mastering
techniques. Too many good tunes get un-noticed or end up sound like tin
pan city, with no bassline or the vocals gets mixed like the producer
hates the emcee.


"...The music & musicians have gotten better, but the sound engineering
has gotten worse...."

What was the general response to your sound?

The response to the Katch 22 was good across the scene worldwide. We
combined a little of skill learned from Hijack (old school Hip Hop
Gods), threw that in with Mad Marga’s love for all things dense and
complex, stirred that in with my own Jamaican musical education and
tutelage from Funk Mafia and our sound came out as Leytonstone meets
Peckham versus Stockwell Funk.

Did you feel like you'd end up being elder statesmen of a scene then?

No. I thought, I’d do one or two albums, probably get done in by MI5
(you know, dying from athletes foot or sneezing or the usual tying hands
behind my back and shooting myself in the face… it’s quite common) or
simply get killed by the BNP for being a freethinking Blackman intent on
showing white youth that we can be defined collectively as humans and
not by our pigmentation. I was awarded an honorary Masters in Music Law
by the university of East London last year and this was the first time I
felt like I was an elder in Hip Hop. I still ain’t used to it though. To
me, I’m just rebel trying to do my thing and stay true to my inner voice.

How did you fall into spoken word poetry then?

I started my creative career as a poet, but I was not ready to embrace
that fully. If you’ve ever heard some of Hip hop’s original rappers like
the Last Poets or Linton Kwesi Johnson then you’d know the Word is not
to be taken lightly. I later developed my skills and began inserting
poetry into my works. The first spoken word track I ever did was an ode
to the death of vinyl on the second Katch 22 album (Dark Tales from Two
Cities- 1992).

What do you love/hate about the London spoken word scene?

For me, true spoken word is part rap and part poetry. It needs the
attitude of Hip Hop and the wit and intelligence of the written word…the
London scene doesn’t always capture that. The more powerful Spoken word
artists can be found up and down the country, not just in London. Kats
like Len Sisey, Phenzwaan, Zena Edwards are beyond all the local
bullshit and represent the UK internationally. I’m humbled by their
skills. There are a few others but I can’t think of them right now.


"...I am more Hip hop than a lot of these tourists who wear the clothes,
talk the talk, buy the music then they later abscond to the next thing…
Traitors...."

Tell us about the new release, Acoustic Afro Hiphop? What sound did you
go for?

The new album is something I’ve wanted to make for a while: A Live Hip
Hop album. The Roots encapsulate the Philly sound well and I wanted to
capture the sound of Babylon Don. The record was made with an old sound
in mind. Rough sonics, Hiss, 2inch tapes, using old instruments, playing
live together rather than layered, sampling drum parts and then playing
them live from beginning to end so even though it’s digital it has a
live feel. No blood cleat quantize.

What lyrical themes do you explore?

I wanted to explore more personal issues like being in love with a girl
who’s moody, forbidden love, crushing emcees, exposing frauds, exploring
the inner sphere and representing my shit out in the open, no fear, no
frills, just a bit of truth and rights. I was bored with hiding behind
bravado… I just wanted to put in all on the line… like Kurt Cobain.

How long did it take to make?

The recording was done over a year in different studios. It took that
long because it was hard finding studios that specialise in dirty
sounds. A lot of today’s music is clean and there’s little room for
dirt. This meant that the gritty, dirty sound is more of a specialist
thing. I can’t do a tune without that dutty, nasty, nail scraping
duttiness you get with tape. I prefer the irregularity of the human feel
in my music, so it has to have a live element. It literally took a year
of dragging big tapes on trains and buses around London’s dodgiest
districts to get the Acoustic Afro Sound.

What are your hopes for this album and what sort of audience do you
expect to find with it?

My hopes for the album is to sell a whole lot of CD’s but it’s always up
to the public what they go for. As for audience, music finds itself to
all nooks and crannies. No one can define their audience (no matter what
the marketing kats tell you). People love good music… so all I can say
is… if you like something a little different from the regular or
something musically challenging or just real, check it out!

How deep into your African roots did you delve, for research into this
album?

I delved back into antiquity to research my connection to the tradition
of music making and it’s relationship to wider African culture. As
Africans have moved from our old world into the new world via slavery,
the role of the musician has remained the same. This through line was an
important revelation for me. In Katch 22, I was a member of a generation
trying to come to terms with our presence in the UK as an unwanted
element. We knew little of our heritage, because our parents were
brainwashed by a colonial education. They taught us nothing and we found
ourselves adrift in an alien culture. When I delved into my African
heritage, I realised that Africa is a diverse continent with over 700
languages, cultures and peoples. I learned that I was a part of an
African Diaspora (a people outside of their homeland) and I felt the
need to make a reconnection.


"...As Africans have moved from our old world into the new world via
slavery, the role of the musician has remained the same...."

A musical reconnection. I needed to forgive our forefathers for selling
us into slavery, for the years of inter-cultural wars that preceded the
European and Arabic Slave trades and I needed to make a journey to my
inner to find the real truth. Once over this hurdle, I began to
recognise a connection that is found when cultures meet and they
automatically begin to exchange ideas. I started to see how many old
world instruments found themselves recreated in the new world, sometimes
presented as being completely disconnected from their original African
roles. For instance, the West African Harp aka The Kora came to Europe
with the Moors and became the Lute, then Cello, then Harp and later the
piano. These things filled me with a sense of pride and confidence that
no matter what bullshit humans get up to or do…music transcends all
barriers of language and culture and speaks to our inner truth.

How did you collect the sounds and melodies that hark back to Africa?

I grew up in Jamaica and was lucky to work in Jamaican folk music as a
child. In particular, I have some knowledge of a Jamaican folk form
called: Mento. A lot of Mento melodies are a combination of old English
shanties (Old English sailor songs dating back to the 1600’s) and
African worship songs. I also worked with Tunde Jegede who is a modern
day Griot and a composer of western classical music. He’s also a Kora
player and his instruments repertoire dates back to 1400 AD. By
combining the two musical concepts, we were able to extract the common
African melodies and this became the basis of the music on Acoustic Afro
Hip Hop.

What do you plan to do live with this release?

We’re currently on tour across the UK and Europe from April until
September doing various shows so check the website for full details.


"...I can’t do a tune without that dutty, nasty, nail scraping duttiness
you get with tape...."

What next projects are you working on?

Well, all this Acoustic Afro stuff has given me a new lease of life. I’m
working on a new sound for a new album. The album is called: CONFESSiONS
OF A TROUBLEMAKER and we’re in the studio at the moment with it. I’m
working with legendary producer Derek Johnson who did stuff with Soul 2
Soul, Caron Wheeler, Blacksmith, Johnny Clarke to name a few. I’m also
working on tracks with Don Jose, new producer Maya Jobarteh (who’s got
some ill shit) and Tunde Jegede. We’re also hoping to finish a Best of
HUNTKiLLBURY FiNN collection for all the heads who missed out on the
3Knights, Moving in the Right Direction, Katch 22 and other wayward gems
over the years. I’m in talks with SON records who may do it in 2006 but
the new album is my priority at the moment.

Do you still see yourself as a hip hop artist or more of a world
music/spoken word pioneer?

Hip Hop is my mother and Reggae is my father. I used to be a good little
boy and I did what mum expected of me. However, with mum’s guidance I’ve
grown into a Spoken Word artist. My mum used to hate it when I played
with Jazz, Rock and even electro-dance music, but I’ve learned to do
what’s right for me. I’m a man now, no longer mummy’s little soldier. As
for World music… that’s a concept developed by colonial morons who
wanted to create a genre to rip off unsuspecting artists who come from
cultures where music is shared and not owned. But, to answer your
question straight up…I am a Hip hop artist. I am more Hip hop than a lot
of these tourists who wear the clothes, talk the talk, buy the music
then they later abscond to the next thing… Traitors. I’m a Hip Hop
artist because everything I do is real, from the heart and the five
elements are always present in my music. I keep things fresh by
presenting the 5 aspects of Hip Hop in new and unfamiliar ways.

How has the live atmosphere of UK hip-hop jams changed for you in the
last 10 years?

The music & musicians have gotten better, but the sound engineering has
gotten worse.

Any final shout outs shameless plugs?

I contributed to a film recently called 500 Years later. It’s being
shown at the ICA on May 1st. If you can’t make it, why not check out the
trailer at: http://www.500yearslater.com.

In prose--let's say fiction, memoir, history--I feel
the strong presence of both what the words say did
happen and the divergent course(s) things could have
taken--Borges' Garden of Forking Paths--even if what
we're told did happen seems quite powerfully
inevitable, there's also this strange soft world of
all the possible alternatives.

Poetry is thickened/heightened speech wherein we are
very much focused on what the words proclaim did
happen and the alternatives are pretty much
extinguished or swallowed up.

And maybe in between these two types of reading
experience, when one experiences a short story that's
very much like an oral tale, the alternatives to what
the words say happened ORBIT that which the words say
did happen.

stephen,

my sense is that it's being perceived (i'm not sure if by its supporters, detractors or both) as a kitchen-sink protest, that is, against everything: bush, roberts, the war in iraq, poor response to katrina, the bank and the fund, global capitalism, etc. unfortunately in my view, as it only perpetuates the image of the left as inarticulate naysayers unable to focus and project a coherent message.

that said, there is a tentative plan for poetry folks from DC to rendezvous with out-of-town visitors saturday evening so if anyone wants more information please contact me backchannel.

sincerely,
tom orange / DC

Thanks, Tom. I hope the absence of much of any response on this list does
not betoken entrenched "screw it all, I am going to stay home and manure the
winter lawn" demo-lethargy. (I realize many of us have had that disease
since the B election.)
A few more broken levees across the land (physical, political, emotional,
spiritual, even aesthetic) will ultimately - I suspect/hope - provide an
answer to ANSWER (if some of those old reborn rhetorics put a plug in one's
activist throat).
Apocalypse does mean "unveiling." We have lot of that - over there on the
Right - going on. That news is obviously talking to the polls. I don't think
the unveiling is exactly what evangelical right wingers were aspiring to see
- their leadership turned into wicked little Roving Angels.

I better stop!

Dear Readers,

I will be taking to the streets  my newly published novel, A Gesture=20
Through Time (Spuyten Duyvil Press).

The book, which has heretofore existed in limited edition, is now=20

Elizabeth Block=92s A Gesture Through Time is a novel for the new=20
millennium.=A0
Deft and funny and wise, it examines authorship, narration, technology,=20=

love, and memory, and asks most playfully what it means to tell a=20
story.=A0 Always inventing and bravely trying out new strategies, she=20
puts most writers and their sorry pretenses of invention to shame.=A0 In=20=

the spirit of Stern=92s Tristram Shandy, A Gesture Through Time captures=20=

the relation of muse and amuse, taking the reader on a spirited,=20
pleasure-filled journey.=A0=A0 Maxine Chernoff

A Gesture Through Time is a work of remarkable ingenuity. With the=20
daring of a poet, Elizabeth Block splices an unexpected montage of=20
elements to tell a story that is as intriguing and immediate as life=20
itself. This meticulously written first novel by Block demonstrates her=20=

sophisticated skills as a writer and a vision that expands the=20
possibilities for fiction.

I will be performing from A Gesture Through Time at various venues this=20=

Poetics,

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 14 new pieces by David-Baptiste Chirot.

If you spend one hour of your walking around outside life thinking
"what could I make that's like these" you will never look at the world
around you the same again. You will see that poetry surrounds us all,
and you'll thank David-Baptiste Chirot for the epiphany.

Enjoy,
Dan

komninos--

Ah, ok, looking at the big picture, I thought it was your specific
situation & vested interest that you wanted addressed.

There is a standard created but since we only publish poetry & it is
such a different situation when compared to publishing houses I have not
paid much attention. There is a "number of copies sold a year" which was
established as a guidline, for some reason 50 comes to mind, tho what
agency created this number or whether it has been forwarded as a general
principle is something I am not clear on. The place that would know is
CLMP: council of literary magazines and presses. There also was an
national authors guild that started addressing the issue and lobbying
for rights about five years back.

I doubt there is a POD contract, even if you sign a regular contract for
1000 copies I suppose that could be dished out over time in small runs.

A POD publisher should have exclusive rights, as the common
misconception is that a single copy can be created. In actuality, the
economies of scale for one copy would be outrageous, or at least will be
if the cover is 4 color, laminated, and attempts to mimic the quality of
a webpress book(a big machine which rolls out the covers and pages in
signatures ((32 pages)). Even places like well known POD publishers for
cash, vanity places like Exlibris probably run a few hundred of the
cover and then print out the interior for POD.

all I can think of for now--

Be well

Everyone please send me either a photocopied hand or a scanned hand, e-mail=

I'm trying to quickly put together a benefit reading
for New Orleans here in Providence, and one of the
readers I have asked said that there is a Boston
Review reading/party that same night, October 11. I
couldn't find anything on their site or by googling
it. Does anyone have any info on it? I'm worried I
should maybe change the date before it's too late...

Hip Hop: Welfano News: President Hugo Chavez Visits Bronx


     In contrast to the official U.S government treatment of the Pres.
Chavez, in the Bronx, at the Point CDC, hundreds of people came to meet
and greet the popular Latin America president with music, love and
admiration. The Welfare Poets, who only a month ago traveled to and
performed in Venezuela at the International Youth and Student Festival,
played a funky African 6/8 rhythm as he entered the Live From the Edge
Theatre and greeted local politicians and supporters who were present.



Welfano News
N.Y.C.

September 17, 2005

Welfanos sing: "Ooo ahh! Chavez no se va!"

President Hugo Chavez of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was
welcomed to the Bronx yesterday by the cheers of "Ooo ahh, Chavez no se
va, Ooo ahh, Chavez no se va."

Pres. Chavez was in NYC for the Security Council meeting at the United
Nations where he blasted the council's initial document as well as the
council's undemocratic nature, citing the outdated veto ability of five
nation members of the Security Council.

"Who has the obligation to protect other [nations]?
The United States, to protect Iraq, invades Iraq.
The United States, to protect Venezuela, launches a coup in
Venezuela," Pres. Chavez responded when asked about the integrity of
the United Nations.

In contrast to the official U.S government treatment of the Pres.
Chavez, in the Bronx, at the Point CDC, hundreds of people came to meet
and greet the popular Latin America president with music, love and
admiration. The Welfare Poets, who only a month ago traveled to and
performed in Venezuela at the International Youth and Student Festival,
played a funky African 6/8 rhythm as he entered the Live From the Edge
Theatre and greeted local politicians and supporters who were present.


The packed theatre became silent when Pres. Chavez made his way to the
Welfare Poets to meet the members of the crew. Welfare Poets elder,
Angel Rodriguez, presented Pres. Chavez with the latest album, Rhymes
for Treason. Pres. Chavez asked for a translation of the album title to
which Hector responded "rimas (lirica) para la traicion" al
imperialismo. Pres. Chavez went on to say that "capitalism was the
science of destruction," before stopping and talking to each member of
the group.

When asked by Pres. Chavez to perform another song, the Welfare Poets
performed "Se Acabo," a song about the struggle for demilitarization
and decontamination in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Pres. Chavez commented
that one of the first things he did when he was democratically elected
was to end Venezuela's participation in bombing maneuvers in Vieques,
sponsored by the United States Navy, where the navy rented the bombing
range to other nations.

As he bopped and sang "Se Acabooooooooo" with the Welfare Poets and
the gathered crowd, the Welfare Poets went from bomba to hip hop
representing lyrics of liberation with rooted rhythms of Puerto Rico,
Africa and the Americas. Pres. Chavez left the theatre in parade
fashion with the Welfare Poets leading the crowd in a chant of "Ooo
ahh, Chavez no se va, Oo ahh, Chavez no se va."

In the Point's atrium, Palo Monte and Bronx community groups greeted
President Chavez, where he pledged to assist river restoration projects
and played guira to Dominican-Haitian music.

Spirits where high for the Welfare Poets, who less than a month ago
performed in one of Venezuela's "hoods" during the International Youth
and Students Festival and where honored for this chance opportunity to
meet and perform for Pres. Chavez. Pres. Chavez left them saying "The
mere fact that you are producing these rhymes in the belly of the beast
is testament to your strength." They will remember the encounter as it
inspires them to continue playing their role educating, organizing, and
performing for the welfare of people under a system where we don't fare
too well. Bidding Farewell to downpression!

The massive orgulloso yells of "Boricua" (Taino word for Puerto Rican
and term of pride and consciousness) and waves upon waves of single
starrred Puerto Rican Flags always sent wonderful chills throughout my
body. Later, after reading history of the United States' colonial
project in Puerto Rico, I realized that waving our flag was more than
just a nationalistic act of pride but also an act of resistance and an
afirmation of our right to self-determination.--HecOne of the Welfare
poets -- "A Meditation on Puerto Rican Day Parade & La Ley Mordaza (Gag
Law)"

I haven't been in on the D.C. buzz regarding this march, but am hoping to
drive down from Philadelphia.  (Any poets from the Philly area who want a
ride, please backchannel.)

I was planning to attend this march well before Katrina blew into town, and
I would presume the attitude of most demonstrators is, as mine, a sense of
outrage and horror at the criminality of the war.  This outrage was
difficult enough to support before Katrina, and my own need to march may be
more therapeutic than anything else.  Katrina has only focused, rather than
distracted from, my intention to vocally oppose the war in Iraq.

I'm not clear on whether to march for "immediate withdrawal," etc.  That
seems simple-minded.  There is now a sense in which we are, and must remain,
accountable beyond ourselves.  I'm more concerned about focusing attention
on the administration's failures and demanding accountability from the
criminals at the top (many of them unelected), who have been driving this
country into the ground: Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle, Rumsfeld, Rove, Bush (who
is the least of them) . . .  And that includes accomplices such as Rice and
Powell.  I am not, Nudel, demanding someone's head on a stick.  Rather, a
modicum of public outrage, and that Congress exercise its duty as a
"balance" of power.  Failing that, the people must make themselves heard.

I share Tom's concern regarding the dismissability of catch-all
puppets-against-everything-bad demos: I honestly don't think this will be
one of those.  The Cindy Sheehan media coup--again, well before Katrina--is
a good indication of mainstream momentum building against the
administration.  Sheehan has been touring the country since and the rallies
have been ever larger.  I know, for example, that all the buses chartered to
take protestors from Buffalo to the rally have sold out, and that the bus
charter companies are now saying they are overbooked.  (Maybe they're still
mired in Louisiana.)

There was some initial dispute over the planning of this march, with two
marches planned: one by ANSWER (the less-focused group, in my opinion) and a
larger one by United for Peace and Justice.  Some weeks ago they came to an
agreement, and decided to join forces.

There is a fairly clear statement on the "Aftermath of Katrina" on the
United for Peace and Justice website (http://www.unitedforpeace.org/).  It
emphasizes the extent to which Katrina only focuses the outrage against the
war: not a matter of "expanding to include" the hurricane catastrophe.

Rather, as just one example, the connections between this administration's
irresponsibility and the dismantling of FEMA are clear enough--blowing wide
open the lie of "homeland security.  This time it's not even a stretch.
Editorials for the NY Times in the week after Katrina by Frank Rich, Bob
Herbert, even David Brooks, did not hesitate to connect the dots, all the
way back to ENRON.

I don't have a TV, so can't say what the living room media climate is like,
how effective Bush's rhetorical airbrushing was last Thursday, etc.  But I
know I'm not going to wait to "test the waters" before throwing in my two
cents, especially now that the Beltway is within spitting distance.

I've been pretty skeptical about the effectiveness of these sort of demos,
but this Saturday I think we are going to see on the streets of D.C., rather
than incoherence, a convergence and strengthening of momentum against those
corrupt leaders whose veneer of coherence has pretty much been washed away
once and for all.  Hope to see as many of you there as possible: anyone who
wants to try to hook up before the march, please backchannel.

That said, the venue for really effective action against the war is the
building counter-recruitment movement on campuses.  American Friends Service
Committee (http://www.afsc.org/) has a good site, including information on
how to opt-out of the biggest ever illegal database, the Joint Advertising
and Marketing Research Services (or JAMRS) database, compiled by a private
marketing firm (BeNow, Inc.) for recruiting purposes to the four branches of
the military.

This database, empowered by a little known provision in the federal Leave No
Child Behind law, includes such sensitive personal information as Social
Security numbers, ethnicity, GPA, personal email addresses, height, weight,
and even cell phone numbers of more than 30 million American citizens
between the ages of 16 and 25.  BeNow, Inc., has no statements on their web
site regarding their own security or privacy policies.

Working Assets, Mainstream Moms and ACORN have also put together a website
called LeaveMyChildAlone.org to help citizens "opt out" of this database.
Needless to say, parents are pretty pissed off about this intrusion on
privacy.  I'm sure we'll see a few of them at the demo on Saturday as well.

Subject: Weekend Anti-War etc Demo question(??)

stephen,

my sense is that it's being perceived (i'm not sure if by its supporters,
detractors or both) as a kitchen-sink protest, that is, against everything:
bush, roberts, the war in iraq, poor response to katrina, the bank and the
fund, global capitalism, etc. unfortunately in my view, as it only
perpetuates the image of the left as inarticulate naysayers unable to focus
and project a coherent message.

that said, there is a tentative plan for poetry folks from DC to rendezvous
with out-of-town visitors saturday evening so if anyone wants more
information please contact me backchannel.

sincerely,
tom orange / DC

This Saturday's anti-war demonstration: Can anyone point me in the direction
of any discussion about ways in the demonstration may or may not be
expanding to include the Katrina/Gulf Coast Bush/Gov disaster (the
"unnatural" one). I mean I get the sense that Iraq has been marginalized by
the huge focus on Katrina - which may either enhance or hinder this
weekend's take on Iraq.
I think it's important that these two Category 5 events not be mutually
self-cancelling. Surely somebody has a syntactic welding iron at work out
there(??)

Dear Friends:

Hi !

I share two quotes from a book called "The Words of Peace" :

"Peace, in the sense of the absence of war, is of little value to someone who
is dying of hunger or cold. It will not remove the pain of torture inflicted
on a prisoner of conscience. It does not comfort those who have lost their
loved ones in floods caused by senseless deforestation in a neighboring country.
Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where people are fed,
and where individuals and nations are free."

-The Dalai Lama (1989)

"Peace starts within each one of us. When we have inner peace, we can be at
peace with those around us. When our community is in a state of peace, it can
share that peace with neighboring communities, and so on. When we feel love and
kindness towards others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for,
but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace."

-The Dalai Lama (1989)

I'm just checked some old e-mails and came across Catherine's citation
of the Terry Quinn piece.  Thanks for posting that, Catherine, and the
points are well taken, but I'd like to add a few more observations:
--editors are not the only ones complicit in the problem of simultaneous
submissions.  I work on 26 Magazine with 4 other editors and we find that
poets will often simultaneously submit and then yank their work from your
mag. if a more 'prestigious' publication accepts the work.  Perhaps the
publish-only-once scenario makes poets feel like they have to get the
most bang for their poetic buck, but I find it really irresponsible when
poets do this and I think it promotes a conversation that is more about
status than the work itself.

--my other comment is meant only to augment Quinn's observations.  Zines
and journals have a misguided sense that there is a time limit during which
newly published books are reviewable.  After about 6 months, maybe less,
a book is 'too old' to be reviewed.  I strongly disagree with this approach as
it's often the case that I only happen upon an interesting book after the
allotted 6 months is up.

EILEEN TABIOS interviews BARBARA JANE REYES and PAOLO JAVIER about their
second poetry books, both forthcoming this Fall 2005: respectively _poeta en san
francisco_(Tinfish) and _'60 lv bo(e)mbs' (O Books).  This is the first
published interview of REYES after the news that _poeta en san francisco_ has
received the Academy of American Poets' James Laughlin Award (the Academy made its
announcement while the interview was being conducted).  Topics addressed include
how the MFA experience was supportive--or not--for these two Filipino poets
(who attended Bard and SF State), translation, the use of footnotes,
colonialism and marginalization, the "Dufusly-Disembodied-Poet from the Suny Buffalo
List", the Phillipine influence on American poetry, the limits as well as
responsibilities of representation, and various other subversions.

Dear Writers, Readers, Speakers & Listeners,=20

=20

On September 30, at 7pm, the library of Temple University Japan will be
the setting for a bilingual oral reading of senryu, authored by Gengoro
("Diving Beetle"), pen name for Tobe Yoshiro. Senryu, like its uncle
haiku, is the Japanese verse form of the syllabic meter 5/7/5, but
ignores the seasonal reference and often contains more meaning compared
to haiku. His works run the thematic gammut: social and political
commentary, human loneliness, and women and business, to mention a few.
In a great parody he modernizes the famous Matsuo Basho haiku "old pond
/ frog leaps in / splash" and Gengoro's senryu (translated in simple
syllable counts)=20

totally agree with second part of your post regarding reviewable time frame.
some times it takes a year before people realize a new book is out and
another few months to read it and then some months for it to mean something
to them and then the aha! that they might want to review it. a good book
should have a shelf life and we are not dealing with highpowered bestsellers
and fast turning money or some thing like that, I have two books on my desk
i received a year ago, just before the last big bridge came out and had no
time to read them, was already closing up the issue, and after the issue was
up I had some time to look the books over and see how much I liked them, so
I am going to present them in the January issue 2006. some times i think
publishers and writers play into the scenarios of the pop market economy,
"what's new, what's hot" and it is really dull...on the other hand don't you
think it's about time we stopped talking about Chaucer, I mean, I'm soooo
over him!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

First, thanks to all who responded to my earlier message about my
experience evacuating the city. Your expressions of friendship and
emotional support helped me a lot, and your offers to send books and even
to let me stay in your homes were very kind and generous. Since I left the
question of the condition of my apartment and collection of books up in the
air, I wanted to offer an update on my situation:

I snuck into the city of New Orleans by car on Sunday two days ago with my
ex, John Clark, in order to inspect our respective homes. We've all seen
images of Katrina?s devastation, but viewing things for yourself has a much
more visceral impact. Uprooted trees and broken limbs everywhere, downed
powerlines draped across the roads, buildings with varying degrees of roof
and window damage. Frequent waves of stench floating through the air. Dead
grass. No birds. Military convoys patrolling the streets. Phone and
electricity repair personnel hard at work in the neighborhoods trying to
restore a semblance of a working infrastructure.

We were pretty surprised to find that we were able to drive directly into
the city, unchallenged by officials asking for id or a reason for being
there. We drove into our neighborhood to find a neighbor already there,
being a good Samaritan patching up his roof and the roofs and windows of
other neighbors' homes. Other than that, the neighborhood seemed completely
deserted.

I looked over to my apartment house and was very hopeful when I didn't see
any shingles out of place or missing. I walked up the dark stairs of the
boarded-up house, opened my apartment doors, and was overjoyed to see
everything just as I had left it - not even a window broken or a telltale
ceiling stain indicating leaky roof! My library and other possessions are
intact and safe, for which I am very grateful. I'm one of the fortunate
ones.

With a perfumed bandana across my nose, I managed to coax the mutated and
very ripe chickens from my freezer and scrub out the whole refrigerator
with Lysol. Then  I helped John to retrieve his truck from his son's house,
where he had left it (someone had tried to hotwire it, but he did manage to
get it started). He stayed overnight with some Food Not Bombs folks and
young anarchists who have set up a sort of headquarters on Desire Street,
assisting and supplying with food and water many of the remaining residents
in the city.

I departed for Lafayette, three hours to the west, before the 6:00 pm
curfew, relieved but also sad about all the suffering that the city and its
people have seen. That feeling never seems to go away. The last thing I
observed in my neighborhood before I left was a mockingbird in an
elderberry tree, which seemed hopeful somehow.

Camille Martin

PS Now here we go again, this time with Rita threatening another mandatory
evacuation of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and delaying official plans to
allow residents to re-enter the city!

:::NEW FROM PALM PRESS:::

(DIS)ORIENT
James Thomas Stevens
ISBN 0-9743181-3-2 =20
28 pages
$10.00

Borrowing from the North American Jesuit Relations and the Lettres =
Edifiantes et Curieuses of the Jesuits in China, and woven into sensual =
personal narrative, this long poem  focuses on the obsession of =
charting. Charting the lakes and rivers of lands on both sides of the =
Bering Strait, charting the borders of our own containers. Mapping as a =
means of showing greatness or inferiority. Do we map our borders based =
on what is reported or echoed back by other? (DIS)ORIENT is an =
exploration of borders, based partially on the ideas of psychoanalyst =
Wilfred Bion, partially on history, but mostly of the self experienced =
though the other. James Thomas Stevens is the author of Tokinish (First =
Intensity Press) and Combing the Snakes from His Hair (Michigan State =
UP) and The Mutual Life, forthcoming from Cambridge. He is a member of =
the Akwesasne Mohawk tribe, holds an MFA from Brown University, and is a =
2000 Whiting Award recipient. He currently teaches English and Native =
American Studies at the State University of New York at Fredonia.

BIRDS OF LOS ANGELES
Wendy S. Walters
ISBN 0-9743181-2-4=20
32 pages
$10.00

Los Angeles is known to be the most photographed city in the world, and =
its deep connection to the movie industry means that it is frequently =
mistaken for someplace else. Through gesture and image, BIRDS OF LOS =
ANGELES is a modern, metaphysical exploration of the way Southern =
California's rich cultural and environmental landscapes are =
misperceived. Wendy S. Walters is Assistant Professor of English at the =
Rhode Island School of Design.

I disagree, as well. It can take several years for a book to reach all of
the magazines that review books and the book, in terms of actual readers,
might still be "new."

Thanks for providing this, Jonathan. Helpful and sanguine.
That will be the day when we see arrest warrants out on more than a few of
these folks. I wish a few Democrats "in power" could come out and say what
you have said.

But for the immediate moment I think walking on Saturday will have to do it.
I got my feet on.

I don't think publishers of the kind of work we write should review along
the pop economy terms Michael described. Most of us have chosen to write
things that we hope will last  well pat our lifetimes instead of something
that will make us rich in this one. And in our field, you could easily say
that a book is new whenever you read it for the first time. Yesterday I
bought a brand-new book: Collected Poems by Lorine Neidecker.

Some good news for us at Tinfish, and for Barbara Jane Reyes, whose book
highly deserves any prize that comes its way!

The book will be out later this Fall.

Telefunken written and performed by Stuart Orr, directed by Barry Laing.
Table 9 Productions @ the Tower Theatre, Malthouse, until September 25.

"Art, like suicide," says Ralph Manheim Mann blackly during the course of
this fascinating show, "is very, very personal."

It's an illuminating analogy. Suicide is at once the ultimate assertion of
self - the conscious decision to override even the deepest survival
instinct, a blasphemous refusal of life - and the self's ultimate erasure.
And if art, as Freud argued, is the sublimation of certain instincts towards
death and sex, it is not a sublimation which yields gratification but is
peculiarly circular. It is, in fact, a masochistic sublimation, erasing
rather than aggrandising the self.

Stuart Orr's one-man aria Telefunken is art of this kind.  Orr's
electrifying physical presence is at the centre of the show, but all our
attention is splintered and diverted from Orr himself by his very
expressiveness.  Personal this show may be, but it is the antithesis of
confessional.

It's a bit of a challenge to describe its complexities. Telefunken works on
several levels, and in reflecting on it, all of them seem to metastasise
uncontrollably, creating dense clusters of allusion and metaphor which
themselves collect more allusions, more metaphors...and it is no accident
that one of the presiding gods in this piece is Loki, the trickster.  I fear
that one viewing is not nearly enough to absorb all of its implications.

great news, Susan -- Yunte was here last night and told me that you had emailed
that there would be good news about the press shortly -- he was wondering what
it could be -- I offered the conjecture that you might have an author who won,
as I put it, "that award whose name I can't remember that's for a second book."

do I get extra credit for prescience despite my inability to retain proper
nouns?

congratulations --

Thank you Vernon.
Today I began a new book:  Gravitations precde de Debecaderes --Jules
Supervielle
              (if you have never before read his poetry--do and you will be
in for a great and lasting surprise, on each page--)
    What Vernon says is true--books stay new because this experience occurs
to innumerable readers throurgh hundreds and hundreds of years, with an
untold number of books.

EILEEN TABIOS interviews BARBARA JANE REYES and PAOLO JAVIER about their
second poetry books, both forthcoming this Fall 2005: respectively _  poeta en san
francisco _(Tinfish) and '60 _  'lv bo(e)mbs'  (O Books).  This is the first
published interview of Reyes after the news that _poeta en san francisco_ has
received the Academy of American Poets' James Laughlin Award (the Academy made
its announcement while the interview was being conducted).  Topics addressed
include how the MFA experience was supportive -- or not -- for these two
Filipino poets (who attended Bard and SF State), translation, the use of footnotes,
colonialism and marginalization, the "Dufusly-Disembodied-Poet from the Suny
Buffalo List", the Philippine influence on American poetry, the limits as well
as responsibilities of representation, and various other subversions

Thirty five years have passed since the death of Charles Olson in =20
1970. While all the signs were there when he died, the country he =20
lived in is almost unrecognizable: decades of covert wars, domestic =20
and international imprisonment on a massive scale, and the flexing of =20=

imperial muscle that now finds the U.S. military in Iraq reveal that =20
the  =93pejorocracy=94 Olson warned of is well entrenched. As almost all =
=20
forms of knowledge and culture have become administered and poetry =20
has become a profession, the questions Olson raised about the world =20
and the role of poetry and knowledge in it are more pointed than ever.

The first major public event emerging from the project will take =20
place on:



             December 3, 2005, from 12 to 7 at the

             Poetry Project at St. Mark=92s Church-in-the-Bowery in New =20=

York City

             131 East 10th st. http://www.poetryproject.com



There will be two components to the event; an open symposium held =20
during the day followed by the New York premiere of Henry Ferrini=92s =20=

film-in-progress:



Poet and the City: Charles Olson and the Persistance of Place, with =20
Amiri Baraka, Diane di Prima, John Malkovich, and many others. The =20
screening will be accompanied with performances by David Amram, Ed =20
Sanders, Anne Waldman, and others to be announced, followed by a =20
reception.



Our idea is to keep the structure of the symposium as open as =20
possible: we would like to see discussion form according to interests =20=

and affinities in the format of a town meeting.

The structural configuration of the day is still evolving and we =20
welcome any ideas.



We have opened a blog (http:www.olsonnow.blogspot.com) to create a =20
forum prior to the symposium and use material posted there as an =20
entryway into the topics of the day, including:



             First Fact: SPACE

             Polis is eyes

             The special view of history

             The initiation of another kind of nation



This is not a call for papers, keynote speakers and panels, but a =20
space for ideas in action in order to articulate our own histories =20
and places within it. Please send material, and/or inquiries =20
addressed to either Michael Kelleher or Ammiel Alcalay at: =20
OlsonNow@gmail.com

There is no need to register but please let us know if you plan to =20
attend.



The event is open to the public: admission is $8; students and =20
seniors $7; members $5 or free.



We invite neophytes, initiates, the immersed and the curious, =20
students and teachers,

  come one and all, no one will be turned away.

  This band is called Operation Wintermist (named after a nazi military
exercise)! They're a "war metal" band from Calgary, AL, they use nazi
imagery on their album covers, wear nazi helmets on stage and their
singer calls himself Panzer. they have also been known to commit various
hate crimes in their home town against minorities. They are playing this
Saturday (September 24) at The Columbia Hotel in Vancouver. This must be
stopped!!!! WE MUST SHOW THAT THIS SORT OF IGNORANCE IS NOT WELCOME IN

Authors sue Google over Google Print
By Nancy Gohring, PC World.com

The Authors Guild and three other writers filed a class action suit =20
on Tuesday against Google Inc. over the Google Print program. The =20
lawsuit charges Google with massive copyright infringement.
Google Print is a beta, or test, project that allows Internet users =20
to search for content in books. Google is in the process of scanning =20
books from several libraries into the searchable database.
The Authors Guild, a society of published writers representing over =20
8,000 U.S. authors, charges that Google has not sought the approval =20
of authors to include their works in the program.
Google does allow copyright holders to exclude their books from the =20
program. However, traditionally, content users must have affirmative =20
authorization from a copyright owner to use the copyrighted material, =20=

said Terence Ross, a partner and copyright law specialist at Gibson, =20
Dunn & Crutcher, a Washington, D.C., law office. =93Merely saying that =20=

if we don=92t hear from you we assume it=92s okay has never been =
accepted =20
by any court and I doubt it would ever be accepted,=94 he said.
Google said in a statement responding to the lawsuit that its =20
activities are consistent with the fair use doctrine under U.S. =20
copyright law and the principles underlying copyright law. Fair use =20
is a concept within U.S. copyright law that allows copyright material =20=

to be used in limited circumstances, such as quoting parts of a novel =20=

for a book review, without the permission of the author.
When users search the Google Print database, they find a =93brief =20
snippet of text where their search term appears,=94 not the entire =20
text, Google explained in the statement.
Still, Google is copying entire works into its database. =93It=92s not =20=

what=92s delivered to the PC user that=92s the copyright issue, it=92s =
the =20
fact that they have copied the entire work in the first place,=94 said =20=

Ross. =93I don=92t see fair use.=94
Google also points to a paper issued by Jonathan Band, an =20
intellectual property lawyer, who cites potentially relevant cases. =20
In one, a company was allowed to make copies of images on Web sites =20
and offer them in smaller, lower quality form because such a format =20
doesn=92t alleviate the need for the higher-quality originals.
Similarly, rather than erode the potential for authors to sell books, =20=

Google argues the program will encourage sales. =93This ability to =20
introduce millions of users to millions of titles can only expand the =20=

market for authors=92 books, which is precisely what copyright law is =20=

intended to foster,=94 the statement said.
Google is working with University of Michigan, Harvard University, =20
Stanford University, The New York Public Library and Oxford =20
University to scan all or part of their books into the Google Print =20
database.
The lawsuit was filed in a New York federal court. The three writers =20
named in the suit in addition to the Authors Guild are Herbert =20
Mitgang, a former New York Times writer and book author, Betty Miles, =20=

a children=92s book author and Daniel Hoffman, a poet and author.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I plan to attend at least some of this event and am glad it is occurring now.  Regards, Tom Savage

Thirty five years have passed since the death of Charles Olson in
1970. While all the signs were there when he died, the country he
lived in is almost unrecognizable: decades of covert wars, domestic
and international imprisonment on a massive scale, and the flexing of
imperial muscle that now finds the U.S. military in Iraq reveal that
the “pejorocracy” Olson warned of is well entrenched. As almost all
forms of knowledge and culture have become administered and poetry
has become a profession, the questions Olson raised about the world
and the role of poetry and knowledge in it are more pointed than ever.

The first major public event emerging from the project will take
place on:



December 3, 2005, from 12 to 7 at the

Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery in New
York City

131 East 10th st. http://www.poetryproject.com



There will be two components to the event; an open symposium held
during the day followed by the New York premiere of Henry Ferrini’s
film-in-progress:



Poet and the City: Charles Olson and the Persistance of Place, with
Amiri Baraka, Diane di Prima, John Malkovich, and many others. The
screening will be accompanied with performances by David Amram, Ed
Sanders, Anne Waldman, and others to be announced, followed by a
reception.



Our idea is to keep the structure of the symposium as open as
possible: we would like to see discussion form according to interests
and affinities in the format of a town meeting.

The structural configuration of the day is still evolving and we
welcome any ideas.



We have opened a blog (http:www.olsonnow.blogspot.com) to create a
forum prior to the symposium and use material posted there as an
entryway into the topics of the day, including:



First Fact: SPACE

Polis is eyes

The special view of history

The initiation of another kind of nation



This is not a call for papers, keynote speakers and panels, but a
space for ideas in action in order to articulate our own histories
and places within it. Please send material, and/or inquiries
addressed to either Michael Kelleher or Ammiel Alcalay at:
OlsonNow@gmail.com

There is no need to register but please let us know if you plan to
attend.



The event is open to the public: admission is $8; students and
seniors $7; members $5 or free.



We invite neophytes, initiates, the immersed and the curious,
students and teachers,

come one and all, no one will be turned away.

HIGHLIGHTS



NEW YORK, NY-On October 1st, 2005, artists, musicians, and poets from New
York and New Orleans band together at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's
Church to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina rebuild their lives and
their
city. Featuring performances by Toni Morrison, Cecil Taylor, Yusef
Komunyakaa, Dael Orlandersmith, Anne Waldman, Denize Lauture, Suheir
Hammad,
Roger Kamenetz, Steve Cannon, Bill Martin, Eddie Bobé, Moira Crone, Hal
Sirowitz, Patricia Spears Jones, and others, the Poetry Project will
donate
100 percent of proceeds from the event directly to the 21st Century
Foundation's Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund.

Emceed by poets and New Orleans natives Tonya Foster and Greg Fuchs, this
all-star afternoon of music, poetry, and testimonials begins at 1 pm and
ends at 4 pm in the Sanctuary of St. Mark's Church. Performances will be
followed by a party from 4 pm to 7 pm in St. Mark's Church's Parish Hall,
where books and New Orleans-themed food, including pralines, gumbo, red
beans and rice, and chicory coffee will be for sale, with proceeds going
to
the 21CF Hurricane Katrina Recovery Fund. The Poetry Project is also
asking
for donations of books, journals, artworks, and clean clothing in good
condition to go to Hurricane Katrina survivors.



The evening is co-sponsored with A Gathering of the Tribes, The
Federation
of East Village Artists and the Bowery Poetry Club. These arts
organizations
have banded together to pool their talent and resources toward helping
Hurricane Katrina survivors rebuild while also honoring the deep and
vibrant
artistic history and spirit of New Orleans. We raise our  voices to
remember
Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Buddy Bolden, Kate Chopin, Tennessee
Williams, John Kennedy O'Toole, and the myriad other giants of American
creative history who found their home in the Crescent City, in the hopes
that a new generation of musicians, poets, dancers, visual artists, and
other creative artists, will again make it their home. New Orleans
musicians, artists, and poets who have taken shelter in New York are
particularly welcome to the event.

The Bowery Poetry Club will also be hosting a benefit for Hurricane
Katrina
victims on Friday, September 30 beginning at 9 pm, based on the work of
New
Orleans-based poet Kalamu ya Salaam, with performances by Amiri Baraka
and
Eric Bogosian, among others. For more information please contact the
Bowery
Poetry Club at (212) 614-0505.

Sergey Gandlevsky & Franck Andr=E9 Jamme
An underground poet during the Soviet seventies and eighties who has
survived the Soviet regime, alcoholism, the asylum, and a life-threatening
brain tumor, Sergey Gandlevsky has emerged as a major figure in the Russian
literary scene.  Winner of both the Little Booker Prize and the Anti-Booker
Prize in 1996 for his poetry and prose, Gandlevsky is the author of numerou=
s
books of poems, a memoir, Trepanation of the Skull (1996); a book of essays=
,
Poetic Cuisine (1998); and a novel.  His books consistently are short-liste=
d
for the top Russian literary prizes.  His work has been translated into
English in A Kindred Orphanhood: Selected Poems of Sergey Gandlevsky (Zephy=
r
Press), by Philip Metres. Gandlevsky=B9s poetry melds a slangy vernacular wit=
h
traditional forms and meters to create what one poet has termed the
=B3explosive cocktail=B2 of Gandlevsky=B9s verse. His poems document the
underground life of a bohemian traveler and debauchee during the twilight o=
f
the Soviet regime with humor and world-weariness, formal severity and
sentimentality.  Translations will be read by Philip Metres. Franck Andr=E9
Jamme lives and works in Paris and Burgundy, France. Since 1981, he has
published thirteen volumes of poetry and fragments, such as Pour les
simples, La R=E9citation de l'oubli, Encore une attaque silencieuse and
Extraits de la vie des scarab=E9es (Fata Morgana, Melville, Flammarion), as
well as numerous limited editions illustrated by such artists as Suzan
Frecon, James Brown, Zao Wou-Ki, Acharya Vyakul, Jan Voss and Jaume Plensa,
among others. He has translated in French some poets, who are friends, such
as Lokenath Bhattacharya, Udayan Vajpeyi and John Ashbery, who translated
his work (John Ashbery translated The Recitation of Forgetting, Black Squar=
e
Editions). His poetry is included in The New French Poetry (Bloodaxe Books)
and The Yale Book of French Poetry (Yale University Press). In 2005 he was
awarded the "Grand Prix de Po=E9sie de la Soci=E9t=E9 des Gens de Lettres" for hi=

A little public service announcement from England's morning edition of the
Independent:
This is global warming, says environmental chief
As Hurricane Rita threatens devastation, scientist blames climate change
By Michael McCarthy, Environment Editor
Published:=A023 September 2005

Super-powerful hurricanes now hitting the United States are the "smoking
gun" of global warming, one of Britain's leading scientists believes.
The growing violence of storms such as Katrina, which wrecked New Orleans,
and Rita, now threatening Texas, is very probably caused by climate change,
said Sir John Lawton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution. Hurricanes were getting more intense, just as computer models
predicted they would, because of the rising temperature of the sea, he said=
.
"The increased intensity of these kinds of extreme storms is very likely to
be due to global warming."
In a series of outspoken comments - a thinly veiled attack on the Bush
administration, Sir John hit out at neoconservatives in the US who still
deny the reality of climate change.
Referring to the arrival of Hurricane Rita he said: "If this makes the
climate loonies in the States realise we've got a problem, some good will
come out of a truly awful situation." As he spoke, more than a million
people were fleeing north away from the coast of Texas as Rita, one of the
most intense storms on record, roared through the Gulf of Mexico. It will
probably make landfall tonight or early tomorrow near Houston, America's
fourth largest city and the centre of its oil industry. Highways leading
inland from Houston were clogged with traffic for up to 100 miles north.
There are real fears that Houston could suffer as badly from Rita just as
New Orleans suffered from Hurricane Katrina less than a month ago.
Asked what conclusion the Bush administration should draw from two
hurricanes of such high intensity hitting the US in quick succession, Sir
John said: "If what looks like is going to be a horrible mess causes the
extreme sceptics about climate change in the US to reconsider their opinion=
,
that would be an extremely valuable outcome."
Asked about characterising them as "loonies", he said: "There are a group o=
f
people in various parts of the world ... who simply don't want to accept
human activities can change climate and are changing the climate."
"I'd liken them to the people who denied that smoking causes lung cancer."
With his comments, Sir John becomes the third of the leaders of Britain's
scientific establishment to attack the US over the Bush government's
determination to cast doubt on global warming as a real phenomenon.
Sir John's comments follow and support recent research, much of it from
America itself, showing that hurricanes are getting more violent and
suggesting climate change is the cause.
A paper by US researchers, last week in the US journal Science, showed that
storms of the intensity of Hurricane Katrina have become almost twice as
common in the past 35 years.
Although the overall frequency of tropical storms worldwide has remained
broadly level since 1970, the number of extreme category 4 and 5 events has
sharply risen. In the 1970s, there was an average of about 10 category 4 an=
d
5 hurricanes per year but, since 1990, they have nearly doubled to an
average of about 18 a year. During the same period, sea surface
temperatures, among the key drivers of hurricane intensity, have increased
by an average of 0.5C (0.9F).
Sir John said: "Increasingly it looks like a smoking gun. It's a fair
conclusion to draw that global warming, caused to a substantial extent by
people, is driving increased sea surface temperatures and increasing the
violence of hurricanes."

There are no more readers of Australian poetry, only writers.  Some time
ago, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we considered =
the
poet, the writer, the author, to be the ultimate authority of the text. =
In
Australia our poetry was appreciated largely for its phonic qualities. =
The
pentameter rhyming verse being the standard. Then as we questioned the
restrictiveness of structuralism and developed post-modern theories of
literature, we questioned the role of author, we questioned the role of =
the
central authority in anything and looked around us at various models =
like
Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, religions and the Atom Bomb and decided =
that
monocentric administrations in any field of human endeavour were indeed =
not
the way forward. We had a canon of poets, and that was that.

Roland Barthes, (the death of the author), around the time of the May =
'68
student revolutions in Paris, questioned the whole authority of the =
author.
From that point on, the reader and critic became more prominent in the
process.  There was the poet, the poems printed in a volume and a person =
who
was reading those poems.  Of course, as the role of criticism increased =
the
number of possible discourses increased. The poetics and aesthetics of
Australian poetry, and also the role of critic became prominent in that
equation.  So we had the poet, the critic, the eventual reading public =
and=20
the poem. =20

With the increased activity in poetry and poetics in the 60's and=20
70's, the establishment of small presses, new technologies to get things =

published more quickly and the growing influence of the Australian
literature academy in Australia, which was set up in the early 60's, =
meant
that the role of author, the poet, was also changing, increasing in
prominence, once again in Australia having started to develop =
communities of
poetry and small groups of like-minded people, pockets or movements of
poetry of particular styles and particular interests, particular =
lifestyles,
and so a real poetic culture began to develop for the first time in
Australia in the 70's.  People were living the style of poets, spending =
the
majority of their time on the work of being poets and being considered =
quite
serious about their work.  People like Eric Beech who refused any other =
kind
of employment to be a poet and there were plenty like him in the 70's =
and
early 80's.

The 70's brought with it the performance poetry scene, not just a =
reading=20
along with a book launch or a reading by a visiting poet to a literary =
group

but venues dedicated to presenting poetry as performance with an =
audience=20
and so the new activity of performance poetry was promoted by the newly=20
formed movements and groups in Sydney and Melbourne all over Australia,=20
feminist groups; ethnic groups; political groups and simply new literary =

groups monitoring and learning from trends from overseas.  By 1978 the
performance poets were recognised as an identifiable grouping for the =
first
time. So the performance poetry reading, the reading became a great part =
of
the poetic culture during the 70's and into the 80's.  Of course, in the
mid-80's, performance poetry and actually literature as performance, =
took a
big step further and started having weekly events in large general =
public
arenas and venues open to the media and the attention of the general =
public
and not merely confined to a literary festival or a university seminar =
or
conference. I might add that if any influences might be attributed to =
the
Australian performance poets it was that of Charles Olson and the Beats.
Whilst English performance poetry of the same era relied heavily on =
rhyming
comic poetry. The theory/paratactic techniques of the =
L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poets
dominated the progressive USA performance poetry scene at that time. In
Australia, the conversational and projectivist styles proliferated =
amongst
performance poets.=20

So hearing poetry was taking off as a way of receiving poetry again. It =
was
a popular way of receiving the poetry in a social environment, and we
started to get specialists in that field, of which I was one in the =
early
80's.  As a performance poet, I started to earn my living through =
poetry,
through the activities of poetry and through the activities of teaching
other people to write poetry.

The boom of the early 80's of the small presses towards the end of the =
80's=20
started to diminish, and in 1995 the major publishers decided that they =
were

not publishing any more first edition, Australian-written poetry volumes =

which meant that a new publishing model had to be developed. One =
successful
publishing model was Five Island Press where they published 6 authors a =
year
and the author undertook to be the sales person and distributor of that
publication over the next however-many-years it may take to sell the
print-run.  A Penguin editor stated in 1996, at a Queensland Poetry =
Festival
that why would they want to publish something that only had a print run =
of
300 copies, because they could be sure that they could sell 300 copies =
and
that was probably just to libraries in Australia.
 =20
So it would appear from 1995, the commercial value of the readership of=20
poetry was zero and so small presses had to take over that role.  And, =
it=20
appears that around 1995, there doesn't seem to be a readership for =
poetry,
although there was a lot of activity still happening in the area of =
poetry.=20
In terms of publication and in terms of performance and in terms of the =
poet

being the promoter of their published works and not the publisher.
Publication of poetry actually increased at the same rate as prior to =
1995.
Activity of poetry at the literary festivals started to decrease, =
whereas in
the 70's and early 80's it was quite high.  Activity at literary =
festivals
has diminished quite a lot because there is no product, no sales, no =
books
being produced by major publishers who support the literary festivals so
they've got nothing to sell. Why should they promote any poet that's
self-published or published via regional press?

So, when I say nobody is reading poetry any more, they are reading it, =
but=20
they are reading it as an activity which has been as a result of a live=20
event in which they have seen the poet reading and perhaps purchased =
that=20
volume from the poet and so they haven't come to it by finding it on=20
bookshelves as we would traditionally think in libraries or in =
bookstores.=20

We may ask if perhaps the quality of Australian poetry diminished and =
that
is why it lost its readership? In the mid-80's, the introduction of =
creative
writing courses to universities came about, following the =
rationalisation of
colleges of advanced education and other tertiary institutions into
universities and multi-campus universities like my own Griffith =
University.
The more traditional English departments, had resisted introducing =
creative
writing as a subject to teach. The English departments and Australian
literature departments were, as well, at that stage, being challenged by =
the
up and coming media and cultural studies elements of humanities =
departments.
As the importance of the reading of all kinds of media as text and the
acknowledgement that there were many different constructions of culture,
English literature professors seemed to become less of a voice of power =
in
the way humanities developed at the universities. Cultural studies and =
media
studies, including television and film studies was now starting to =
dominate
more within the Academy and it could be true that it was dominating also =
in
the market of available media. It could also be one of the reasons the
readership of poetry has become less and less and less as an activity, =
when
there are so many other media-type-related activities to choose from =
these
days which are relatively easier and involve switching on something
electrical.

So, around about that time in 1985, when certainly the public face of=20
literature was highest, the book publishers were finding it very=20
expedient to attach celebrity status to those authors and have those =
authors
promoting their works on television, radio etc. and making Australian
literature a lively activity.  We had also a lot of experimentation in =
the
late 80's, early 90's with poetic form, having finally realised that =
there
were no rules about how one wrote poetry, or that governed the poetics =
of
poetry or the aesthetics, that it was pluralist ideas domain which could
accommodate many different types of poetry. The prominence of poetry, =
that
was written to be read, and not sounded, was promoted by academics =
charged
with the arguments of Derrida, that poetry was phonocentric and =
phonologic
in nature, and the written word was the other side of a falsely =
constructed
duality. The complete abandonment of poetry that had rhyme, metre, =
phonic
qualities of assonance and alliteration, line/breath, etc, in the
publications of the university and mainstream presses in the 80s and =
early
90s, poetry that didn't always resolve, that defied ultimate =
interpretation,
that removed elements of the self, that challenged the phonic elements =
of
speech, was the poetry chosen by critics and editors as being the most
theoretically advanced poetry, and the poetry that should be published.

But in the mid-80's or so we started to realise that it was something =
that
people wanted to learn to do. University courses being established
throughout Australia and a network of creative writing courses being set =
up
The creative writing courses that were being set up, not wanting to be
associated with the creative writing programs and criticisms of the =
creative
writing programs from the USA which had developed into a very workshop,
confessional, autobiographical type of writing by these university =
courses.
I think the universities were keen not to have this style of workshop or
creative writing course but more theory-based creative writing courses,
post-modernist theories which challenged the traditional poetry and the
traditional writing styles and encouraged experimentation with meaning =
and
experimentation with imagery and experimentation with the written word =
on
the page in particular and what that could do. It was an experimentation
with words, not sonic experimentations, not being explored for the sonic =
or
phonic qualities of the words and how they were being combined, not =
using
rhyme and rhythm and even line per breath or projective verse type of =
sonic=20
considerations, phonological considerations for that poetry but the =
poetry=20
as it happened on the page and the words that were happening on the page =
and

their relationship to each other and the spaces around them.

So, there was a lot of academic experimentation with theory and with =
poetry=20
and there was a lot of publishing along those lines here in Australia =
after=20
the introduction of creative writing courses to universities into =
academia.=20
But it also produced a generation of writers, new writers, who knew what =
the

histories and issues and theories of writing and how they had developed =
from

the time of AD hope until the present.  They knew of movements in the =
United

States and their effect on Australian writing.  They knew of how =
Australian=20
writing fitted into a global literature scene because they were studying =

this in their creative writing courses and so they were not only=20
experimenting with form, they were introducing and allowing their =
practice=20
to be determined by the theories that they had learned and the movements =

they had learned about.  So we got a very high quality of poetry being=20
produced and there is still an extremely high quality of poetry being=20
produced in this country but the avenues for its publication have become
less and less and less.  Self-publication is increasing.  Regional
publication is still happening.  People are moving to the Web to =
publish.
There are established literary journals.  There are established poetry
magazines, ezines, poetry on the Web where people can publish these days =
but
apart from self-publication, publication by newspapers, literary =
journals
and occasional anthologies, are limited.  University of Queensland Press
brings out the best of 2005 poets.  They are chosen from works that have
been published in journals and poems that have been published in =
literary=20
journals and the same with Penguin.

So, instead of having twelve single authors' publications coming out a =
year=20
as they used to have before 1995, UQP is now one anthology with the best =
of,

for the year but at least you're getting a slice of what's happening in =
the=20
print publication scene.  There are other publications like Papertiger
(annual cd-rom of multimedia poetry) which is, I suppose, a truer
representation of what's happening across the scene of poetry in =
Australia
in terms of the areas of digital publication, print publication and =
sound
publication and audio-visual.  So, the reading of poetry, well, as I =
say,
no-one reads poetry any more. =20

What some people have realised is the tremendous benefit to themselves =
of
writing poetry and it doesn't seem to matter too much these days if it's
read or not or bought to be read as long as the person who's written the
poem gets some sort of acknowledgement for it for being a poet which =
seems
strange because it seems like the whole industry has changed from being
something that people appreciated what an author did to something that
people appreciated for something they can do; and they do.  So, whilst =
there
is a large writership, there is a very little readership of poetry in =
2005,
people are doing it, people are now listening to it, people are buying =
it,
people are publishing it, people may occasionally read it but not in the =
way
they used to do it in 1985 or prior to 1995.

You say 'There are no more readers of Australian poetry, only writers.'

There was a somewhat-related post to rhizome today called "Anyone can Edit:
understanding the produser" in which it was argued that

"Marshall McLuhan's dictum "everyone's a publisher" is on the verge of
becoming a reality and, more to the point, as the Wikipedia proudly
proclaims, anyone can edit. The effect of these changes is not simply more
(and more informed) consumption. We are not turning into Alvin Toffler's
prosumers: consumers with an almost professional level of knowledge about
what they consume, but consumers nonetheless. Instead, users are becoming
active producers of content in a variety of open and collaborative
environments."

Being able to both read and write is of course crucial to literacy. The
ubiquity of digital communications routinely puts people in situations where
they have to produce something with a computer, whether it's a document or
picture, web page, sound file, video, etc. This increase in media
production, whether for personal, interpersonal, or public use/consumption
is, in a sense, the triumph of an avant garde that, at least since dada and
futurism, has been into fucking around with media. In a way that can be
read--but which is best appreciated by those also attemting to write in the
particular medium in question. As soon as you start to try to write in a
given medium, you encounter all sorts of issues that you were previously
oblivious to. Art is no longer a commodity. It's an activity, something we
engage in to communicate. We typically read *and* write in various media.

Readers outside the USA may get an incorrect impression from this sentence.
Depending on your definition of the word "progressive," this seems to be a bit
of an over statement.   In most parts of the USA during the period you are
speaking of, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry's approach to performance was known pretty
much the same way our knowledge of readings in Australia was known, by way of
rumor.  damned intriguing rumors, and in DC, where I grew up, you could
actually get up to New York and confirm the rumor -- our small, local outpost
of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E was a little less performance oriented, but we heard of
legendary evenings in San Francisco with great interest.

Would anyone be interested in interviewing poet Anne Blonstein for The Argotist Online? Blonstein would prefer, if possible, an interviewer with some familiarity of her work. The original interviewer had to pull out due to work pressures.

from Ara Shirinyan, publisher of Make Now Press

MAKE NOW PRESS is pleased to announce the publication of three titles
available during the first week of November.

Pre-orders at a discount support the Press, as we have never before released
three books concurrently.

Writings for the OuLiPo
By Ian Monk
0-9743554-4-5
66 pages
$16.50 (presale price $14, includes shipping in the US)
(available November 2005)

From the hilarious univocalisms of "Homage to Georges Perec" to the dizzying
"information" provided in the literally falling "Twin Towers," Ian Monk
demonstrates that Oulipo is by no means only-or even primarily-- a French
import; on the contrary, its possibilities for Anglophone poets are
enormous.  Monk's sheer inventiveness and intellectual agility, his verbal
wit and prosodic skill will have you chuckling over his "Snowballs" and
marveling at his anagrammatic threnodies.  Writings for the Oulipo is a book
to savor-good to the last drop!--Marjorie Perloff

Ian Monk's new collection of poetry and prose is a major breakthrough in
English literature. Writings for the Oulipo is powerful, witty, original,
and uniquely combines dazzling verbal skills with a robust and raunchy
approach to contemporary life. I've never read and enjoyed anything like it,
and neither have you.--Harry Mathews

Seance
Edited by Christine Wertheim and Matias Viegener
0-9743554-5-3
217 pages
$18.50 (presale price $15, includes shipping in the US)
(Available November 2005)

Seance is a volume of readings and papers on the subject of the condition of
language and narrative in contemporary writing.  Pairing poetic formalists
and sex writers, language poets and 'pataphyscial researchers, the
collection examines the translation of the ordinary into words, from the
extraordinary writing of sex to the supposed disappearance of the author.
Further sections are on the phenomenological training of the person, radical
artifice, and the magic of letters freed from the grid of the page.  Among
the short stories, poems and essays are texts by Charles Bernstein, Dodie
Bellamy, Christian Bök, Dennis Cooper, Robert Gluck, Kenneth Goldsmith,
Shelley Jackson, Ben Marcus, Eileen Myles, and Joan Retallack.

Oulipo Compendium
Edited by Harry Mathews
and Alastair Brotchie
Revised & Updated
ISBN 0-9746554-3-7
341 pages
$36.00  (US and Canada only!) (presale price $32, includes shipping in the
US)
(Available November 2005)

Make Now Press of Los Angeles and Atlas Press of London will be releasing a
revised and updated edition of the Oulipo Compendium in November 2005 in a
limited edition print run of 1,000 copies to be released from Los Angeles
and 1,000 copies to be released from London. The Oulipo Compendium is a
dictionary of mathematical constraints used in the composition of
literature. The Oulipo's foremost concern has been to devise formal
constraints and compose a few examples of each for the express purpose of
pointing to the potential these formalisms create. Oulipian constraints have
been responsible for some of the most original works of literature ever
produced.

Des Moines, IA

Drake University's Department of English seeks an outstanding teacher
and active poet to teach courses in poetry writing and worldwide poetic
traditions (pending final budgetary approval).

Secondary interest in one of the following:
   - hybrid or postmodern writing
   - multimedia poetics
   - performance poetry
   - critical theory/history
   - law and literature
   - new global perspectives on literary study

Three classes per semester, all undergraduate, including a first year
seminar in the fall term.

Drake University values interdisciplinary research and teaching and
seeks to attract candidates prepared to develop courses and programs
that integrate classroom learning with learning that takes place outside
the classroom.


Requirements:

Candidates must have:
   - relevant teaching experience
   - commitment to ongoing research and writing
   - Ph.D. or M.F.A. in hand at beginning of
     first term of appointment


Application Process Instructions:

For December interview consideration send:
   - letter of application
   - c.v. (include e-mail address to acknowledge receipt)

postmarked by Oct. 20 to:

	Joseph Lenz, Chair
	Department of English
	Drake University
	Howard Hall, 2507 University
	Des Moines , IA 50311
	mailto:joseph.lenz@drake.edu

The department has 14 full-time faculty members and 120 majors in
English and Writing. All faculty hold the appropriate terminal degree.
Many faculty members have been recognized for their teaching and writing
both locally and nationally by NEH, NEA, Fulbright Foundation,
Guggenheim Foundation and the National Council of Teachers of English.
Students develop their program of study with their faculty advisers in
English.

The vitality of our commitment to the classroom is evidenced in the many
changes we have made in our curriculum. In particular, we are excited
about our Writing Major and Minor, a program designed for those students
who wish to concentrate their course work on developing their writing.
We are happy to give students the option of choosing either the English
Major and Minor and the new Writing Major and Minor.

Drake's location in Des Moines, Iowa's capital city and cultural center
means plenty of variety - from bike trails and botanical gardens to
comedy clubs and consignment shops. The city's diverse offerings include
the antique shops and one-of-a-kind boutiques of historic Valley
Junction; downtown's lively Court Avenue restaurant district; a zoo,
science center and art center, a local symphony orchestra; several
theatre companies; and one of the top 10 arts festivals in the nation.

Drake's 150-acre campus is nestled in a residential neighborhood in the
heart of Des Moines. Just 10 minutes from downtown and minutes from the
Interstate, the Drake neighborhood is an eclectic mix of shops, services
and beautiful turn-of-the-century homes, some located on the National
Historic Register. There are coffeehouses, local and chain restaurants,
an art-house movie theater, grocery stores, drug stores, and specialty
shops - all within walking distance of campus.

Brilliant Indian summer day in San Francisco. Parade route from Dolores Park
over to and down Market, up Van Ness to Turk, West to Jefferson Park.
Definition of a Post-Modern Demonstration  is Don't listen to the speeches
at the Start, Don't Listen to Speeches at the Finish. Walk and enjoy the
costumes, signage, other people's conversations, the drumming, the cat-calls
in unison up and down the parade, salute the City. Of course, take umbrage
at the Police with numerous surveillance cameras operating in full view -
umbrage because the equipment was no doubt bought with Homeland Security
Federal Grants to the local police  - that's Homeland Security, the Federal
Agency that somehow could not use its surveillance equipment to see that a
hurricane was coming dead on to the Gulf Coast.
One of my favorite signs:
Read Between the Pipelines
The weirdest:
Free Hinkley
The day's tone: Unlike three years ago, in the build-up before the war, and
the one in New York before the Republican convention, instead of an optimism
that the demonstration might work to alter Administration policy, or produce
a new Administration, one senses two things:
1. The built-up rage is much more focused on Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld -
their lies, deception, and what many have become to openly declare as
criminal behavior.
2. A deep sense of collective violation and lament- that we, the Republic,
have been almost irreparably damaged by the behavior, decisions and
consequences of this regime. A hopelessness - in the process of the Demo -
negated to a degree by walking, walking between the speeches, between Start
and Finish. Even as this so-called leadership begins to openly implode,
there is fear that the damage and debts incurred may be ones from which it
will take great leadership to recover. And, 'pray tell us', I suspect many
of us are asking, where on the political horizon is such leadership?

If interested, I got a few Demo photographs up on my blog:

Love to hear an account of what things felt like  in Los Angeles and
Washington, D.C. And London

I'm forwarding the following from Charles Alexander, Director of this =
year's
Tucson Poetry Festival.

--Tenney

****

Dear Friends:

I'm writing this not from my "official" position as Artistic Director of =
the
Tucson Poetry Festival this fall, but as a poet, fan of poetry, activist =
in
this art, and friend to you -- members of POG, friends of those people,
students of mine, colleagues, and others I know and have worked with in =
the
last twenty-plus years in Tucson.

I am writing about the Tucson Poetry Festival, which runs from October =
6-9,
2005. You may already have received a brochure in the mail, you may be
paying attention to the web site at http://www.tucsonpoetryfestival.org
(which will be growing in the next several days to include more =
information)
or you may just wait for the schedules and articles coming in the =
Arizona
Daily Star, Tucson Weekly, Downtown Tucson, and elsewhere the week =
before
the festival begins.

I just want to say that it's been an amazing festival to help put =
together.
From the beginning, friends here and around the country have been =
extremely
helpful. All of the featured poets -- Kathleen Fraser, Will Alexander, =
David
Shapiro, Tenney Nathanson, Patrick Pritchett, and Heather Nagami -- have
been terrific to work with as the festival approaches. Some of these =
people
you know, particularly if you have followed POG & Chax Press over the =
years.


Tenney Nathanson (living in Tucson) is co-founder of POG and has been =
one of
the great poets, and activists for poetry, and teachers of poetry, in =
Tucson
ever since I have been here, and I came in 1984, so I'm talking about a =
fair
span of time. It has been my pleasure to call him a colleague and friend =
for
these years, and to witness his thinking about poetry and his work in =
poetry
-- his book on Walt Whitman, his teaching at the University of Arizona, =
his
participation in many events, his chapbook One Block Over, and more. But
now, this year, 2005, is Tenney's year -- with a new book, Home on the
Range, from O Books, and a book to come (and be available for the first =
time
at the festival), Erased Art, from Chax Press. You know him, you love =
him --
come hear him, come take his small group session, hear him on a panel =
with
others. His thoughts may be those that power you the most in coming =
years,
as you think about poetry.

Heather Nagami is the youngest poet of the festival, a recent graduate =
(3
years ago) from the MFA Program at the University of Arizona, currently
about to move to the Boston area, from Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. =
When
in Tucson, Heather was at almost all POG events, helped plan some of =
them,
edited the Sonora Review, and was one of the great poets here for that
two-year period. Hearing and reading her work then made me a friend of =
it,
from now on. I am very happy to help bring her back, and, while she is =
here,
to unveil her first book, Hostile, from Chax Press.

Will Alexander has read for POG in the past, paired with Jim Waid in =
what
was truly a cosmologically visionary evening. His work, springing from =
such
writing influences as Aime Cesaire, and participating in a visionary =
black
art tradition that includes such musicians as Sun Ra, never fails to =
amaze
me, spin me, thrill me, every time I read a page, a poem, a book. Will, =
who
lives in Los Angeles, is both painter and poet (so is Heather), and he =
is
ideal for the current festival, whose theme is Poetry & Painting. Pay =
close
attention when you hear him read -- you will be well rewarded.

David Shapiro is a poetically thinking and acting, artistically =
inspiring,
intellectually dizzying bundle of energy. Living in New York, he has =
been at
the center of the New York School of poetry for a few decades. He has =
also
written widely about painting and the visual arts in many books and
catalogues, and has collaborated with Jasper Johns and many others. Some =
of
you will remember that he appeared at the Tucson Poetry Festival about 7 =
or
8 years ago. I've been wanting to hear him again ever since. When I read =
his
work (and I've been reading it a lot lately), it's such a rare =
combination
of wit and compassion that it pleases me, puzzles me, makes me laugh, =
and
makes me feel more at home in the world, as strange as that world may =
be.
Try and spend time just talking with David while he is here. That's a
memorable experience.

Patrick Pritchett is a mainstay of the poetry scene in Boulder, Colorado =
--
having taught at Naropa University, currently teaching at the University =
of
Colorado, active in reading series and a chapbook publishing collective
there. He's coming to be known around the country and beyond as a most
careful and compelling poet and writer about poetry. Several years ago I
began reading the most detailed reports from him, of conferences and
readings in various places, that were just illuminating about poetry and
ideas and people and their writing & thinking. I hoped then to someday =
meet
him, so I felt really lucky when he contacted me and gradually became a
friend of Chax Press. On three trips to Boulder I got to know him =
better,
got to hear him speak, and ended up choosing his book Burn: Doxology for
Joan of Arc, for Chax Press to publish -- it's been out just for a few
weeks. Now, finally, I'll get to hear him read. I'm ready and excited.

And Kathleen Fraser. I don't exactly remember if I met Kathleen through =
Tom
Mandel, or if it was the other way around. I know my life in poetry has =
not
been the same since meeting her, but that her work was important to me =
long
before I met her. I was a reader of her poetry for some years, but I =
became
a real fan of her whole life in poetry when I was an early reader and
subscriber of HOW(ever), maybe my favorite 1980's poetry journal, just =
16 or
so pages several times a year, bringing feminist theory into conjunction
with avant-garde writing by women, and in the process enlightening not =
just
those two fields, but a much larger territory. My first connection of =
Tucson
with Kathleen was when she edited an early mini-anthology of language =
poets
for Tucson's premier journal of the time, Ironwood. That issue made me =
an
Ironwood reader, and continued making me a Kathleen Fraser fan -- its =
care
to articulate, somewhat from an outsider's viewpoint, the importance of =
that
poetic moment, was critical to many people's thinking about that poetry, =
and
about the important poetry in general of that time. Later, I would be =
able
to know Kathleen, to publish her book When New Time Folds Up, to write =
about
her work, to see what she would write about mine, to present her in a
residency when I lived in Minnesota, and to be, with great pleasure, a =
part
of her company. Her book of essays, Translating the Unspeakable, =
published a
couple of years ago, is one of the great works about poetry of the last
several decades. Her selected poems, titled Il Cuore: The Heart, is a =
book
we all should have, read, and re-read. All of our lives in poetry would =
be
less without the work of Kathleen Fraser. I once wrote that I thought =
her
work is sometimes misunderstood because readers are carried away first =
by
its beauty, something that can be difficult to look beyond, but more
recently I have been thinking that it is not so much beauty per se, but =
a
compassion that allows the beauty to emanate from her work. Her =
compassion
spreads to include all of us. Like all the others at this festival -- =
come
hear her, talk with her, be in the company of this festival. You will be
glad you did.

All of these people together. I'm just so pleased that it is happening. =
And
that all of the poets have embraced the theme of Poetry & Painting in
creative ways (that will be evident in their panel comments and small =
group
sessions, and in many of the readings), and that all of these poets =
share a
sense of wonder and courageous experiment in their work, make this, to =
me,
the most cohesive Tucson Poetry Festival that has ever occurred, =
certainly
that I've ever either witnessed or of which I have been a part.

There's a lot more at this festival -- student readings (ArtsReach =
students,
with Marlon Evans) on Thursday night, a state poetry contest winner's
reading, two painters (Tucsonans Katherine Josten & Josh Goldberg)
participating in the festival panel along with the poets -- worth a =
message
three times this long, but I've probably taken enough of your time.=20

I can just say, if you would ever consider immersing yourself in the =
whole
of a poetry festival, this is the time. For yourself, for the poets, for =
the
festival, and for more reasons that will become really clear when you =
are
there, do it. Come. Be a part of it. If you can only come for one day or
evening, or two, do that, and more if you can -- the more you make it =
your
festival, the better for all of us.

Just about all events of the festival are at the Historic YWCA on 5th
Avenue, just south of University Ave., just a couple of blocks north of =
6th
Street. I'll send something like a more official press release later (a =
week
in advance, perhaps). But I just didn't feel that was enough. I hope I =
see
all of you there.

And please . . . please pass this message and others about the festival =
on
to any other lists to which you belong, to friends, to colleagues, to
families, to students and teachers, to everyone.

Thank you,

Charles

>
>David Shapiro is a poetically thinking and acting, artistically inspiring,
>intellectually dizzying bundle of energy. Living in New York, he has been at
>the center of the New York School of poetry for a few decades. He has also

>you will remember that he appeared at the Tucson Poetry Festival about 7 or
>8 years ago. I've been wanting to hear him again ever since. When I read his
>work (and I've been reading it a lot lately), it's such a rare combination
>of wit and compassion that it pleases me, puzzles me, makes me laugh, and
>makes me feel more at home in the world, as strange as that world may be.
>Try and spend time just talking with David while he is here. That's a
>memorable experience.
>
>Patrick Pritchett is a mainstay of the poetry scene in Boulder, Colorado --
>having taught at Naropa University, currently teaching at the University of
>Colorado, active in reading series and a chapbook publishing collective
>there. He's coming to be known around the country and beyond as a most
>careful and compelling poet and writer about poetry. Several years ago I
>began reading the most detailed reports from him, of conferences and
>readings in various places, that were just illuminating about poetry and
>ideas and people and their writing & thinking. I hoped then to someday meet
>him, so I felt really lucky when he contacted me and gradually became a
>friend of Chax Press. On three trips to Boulder I got to know him better,

>weeks. Now, finally, I'll get to hear him read. I'm ready and excited.
>
>And Kathleen Fraser. I don't exactly remember if I met Kathleen through Tom
>Mandel, or if it was the other way around. I know my life in poetry has not

>subscriber of HOW(ever), maybe my favorite 1980's poetry journal, just 16 or
>so pages several times a year, bringing feminist theory into conjunction
>with avant-garde writing by women, and in the process enlightening not just
>those two fields, but a much larger territory. My first connection of Tucson
>with Kathleen was when she edited an early mini-anthology of language poets
>for Tucson's premier journal of the time, Ironwood. That issue made me an
>Ironwood reader, and continued making me a Kathleen Fraser fan -- its care
>to articulate, somewhat from an outsider's viewpoint, the importance of that
>poetic moment, was critical to many people's thinking about that poetry, and
>about the important poetry in general of that time. Later, I would be able
>to know Kathleen, to publish her book When New Time Folds Up, to write about
>her work, to see what she would write about mine, to present her in a
>residency when I lived in Minnesota, and to be, with great pleasure, a part
>of her company. Her book of essays, Translating the Unspeakable, published a
>couple of years ago, is one of the great works about poetry of the last
>several decades. Her selected poems, titled Il Cuore: The Heart, is a book
>we all should have, read, and re-read. All of our lives in poetry would be
>less without the work of Kathleen Fraser. I once wrote that I thought her
>work is sometimes misunderstood because readers are carried away first by
>its beauty, something that can be difficult to look beyond, but more
>recently I have been thinking that it is not so much beauty per se, but a
>compassion that allows the beauty to emanate from her work. Her compassion

>hear her, talk with her, be in the company of this festival. You will be
>glad you did.
>

So, finally got a version of our "New Orleans" song (called "Where Were You
Yesterday?"), written in the aftermath (and continuance) of what many in the
black community are aptly calling HURRICANE AMERIKKKA,  up on our myspace
page (www.myspace.com/continuous peasant). This version is song by Ms.
Miriam Jcobson (there's another that I sing with my less "commercial" raspy
voice that will also surface soon). I apologize for not making the song
downloadable right now, but at least you can hear it (and, yes, even TALK
BACK TO IT if you want!).

If you're interested in downloading, all proceeds from downloads will go to
Hurricane Relief (NOT THE RED CROSS---more on that, when I get the download
mechanism in place). Also, I'm handmaking an EP that features these two
versions of the song, along with another non-New Orleans related song, which
you can purchase directly from me (again all proceeds will be donated) for
$5.99

But in the meantime, feel free to listen, and spread the word and request it
on KPFA, KALX, KUSF, KPOO, KZSU, Pirate Cat Radio and Air America (of the
Bay Area stations) ; and, last but not least, PLEASE LET ME KNOW if you or
anybody else you know has written a song about this crisis. Maybe we could
convince somebody like JELLO BIAFRA (don't know why I'm singling him out;
probably coz he's local) to put a COMPILATION together.

My short intro to Charles Alexander's email about the Poetry Festival was
imprecise (where his announcement was precise).  Charles is the Festival's
Artistic Director.  The Executive Director is Teresa Driver, and questions

Call for Participation

I'm looking for poets and fiction writers willing to participate in a
project to archive versions of texts in progress. An electronic
document repository (known as a Concurrent Versions System, or CVS)
will be used to track revisions and changes to original fiction and
poetry contributed by participating writers who will work by checking
their drafts in and out of the repository system. The goal is to
provide access to a work at each and every state of its composition
and conceptual evolution­-thereby capturing the text as a living,
dynamic object-in-the-making rather than a finished end-product.

Participating writers must agree to:

* Work with your text exclusively within the confines of the CVS,
checking it in and out each and every time you wish to edit or
compose.

* Give their consent to make all archived versions of the work
publicly accessible.

The result will be a Web-accessible archive, with the full text of
each and every version of a writer's text available for reading and
relations between the versions expressed by means of maps and
visualizations.

To participate, please contact Matthew Kirschenbaum, Department of
English and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities
(MITH), University of Maryland, mgk@umd.edu . Please indicate your
willingness to abide by the above constraints.

(Note that I'm not on the Poetics list and won't see replies posted there.)

I missed Xanax Pop. It was friendly, like a numeric

Begun June 2004, Xanax Pop is poem-as-blog and

Curator’s statement:

“I first met Don Cherry in 1978 – after recording together in Chicago, he
invited me to live in his and Moki’s house in Sweden and to perform with
him – my first European tour. It was a life changing experience - we
played music around the clock with musicians from around the world who
stopped through. He also introduced me to Ornette Coleman’s concept and
got me started composing music.

Don was so generous – he opened the door for me, as he did for so many.
He was educating at every moment – you only had to listen and look. In my
travels since then, I am always meeting musicians who were inspired by
Don.

Don pointed the way for so much of what is happening now in music. He was
the prototype “world musician”; he knew how to lift the music of anyone
he performed with, from any culture in the world, while always sounding
like himself.

For me, Don was a musical mentor as well as a life mentor. Don’s spirit,
outlook and philosophy were so deep and radiant. From him I learned that
music is more than a profession; that sound itself is sacred, that
silence is sacred. I learned about having the courage to pursue your own
creative vision, about the importance of listening and imagination, and
about the relationship of knowledge to freedom. He showed that being open
to seeking knowledge is integral to the life of an artist. Don said his
trumpet was an amplifier to his inner voice. He showed how to reach for
that. Don understood about humility. He often said “music doesn’t belong
to anyone; we come to music.”

I feel like this Don Cherry Celebration is already a success before the
music has even started: just all of the musicians connecting and talking
about and remembering Brother Don. It is best now, though, to let the
music speak for itself…so, see you there…. “in a minute.”

Peace,

Adam Rudolph

musical aesthete, his gifts led many other musicians in that category to
develop and display their own natural gifts.  I and many others are
forever indebted to Don Cherry.  His music continues to live in us all.”
-- With love and respect, Henry Grimes

“I met Don shortly after he came to NY with Ornette. While I never knew
him as well as I would have liked, his work on the instrument served as a
repository of information and a source of inspiration. In my opinion,
Don's best work has to be included with the work of the innovational
performers on the instrument.”  -- Bill Dixon

The Contemporary Writers Series at Mills College welcomes poet CLAUDIA
RANKINE tomorrow, September 27th at 5:30 pm in the Mills Hall Living Room.


"Or Paul Celan said that the poem was no different than a handshake. I
cannot see any basic difference between a handshake and a poem--is how
Rosmarie Waldrop translated his German. The handshake is our decided
ritual of both asserting (I am here) and handing over (here) a self to
another. Hence the poem is that--Here. I am here. This conflation of
the solidity of presence with the offering of this same presence
perhaps has everything to do with being alive."
--Don't Let Me Be Lonely


Claudia Rankine was born in Kingston, Jamaica. Her most recent book,
Don't Let Me Be Lonely (Graywolf, 2004) moves between essay, lyric and
TV images in a ruthless examination of contemporary U.S. culture and
politics. Robert Creeley called it "the most articulate and moving
testament to the bleak times we live in I've yet seen. It's master
work in every sense, and altogether her own." She is the author of
three other books, Plot (Grove Press, 2001), The End of the Alphabet
(Grove Press, 1998) and Nothing in Nature is Private (Cleveland State
University Press, 1995).

Presents a brand new revolutionary drama from a young Nuyorican:
'MACHETERO'

PEDRO’S GOT A PIPEBOMB
SET FOR THE 4th OF JULY

MACHETERO – A French journalist Jean Dumont
(played by Isaach de Bankolé of The Keeper,
Ghost Dog, Coffee and Cigarettes) comes to NY
to interview Pedro Taino, (played by Not4Prophet
voice of Puerto Punk band RICANSTRUCTION)
to try and understand why Pedro has decided to
use violence to free both himself and his people
from the yoke of US imperialism.

As they speak another ghetto youth, (played
by Kelvin Fernandez, in his first starring role),
trapped in an unending cycle of violence is growing
up in the streets to become the next MACHETERO.

The film features songs from RICANSTRUCTION's
album LIBERATION DAY as well as an all new
improvised score from RICANSTRUCTION that
runs from hardcore be-bop puerto punk to
haunting and surreal afro-latin rhythms
and percussions.

No, but I say it succinctly:

Politics has no business in writing; when we write about politics we take s=
ides. Political writing is of politics and enacts the political. It is a po=
litical move rather than a stance.=20

Can a stance be a move? The ball is in your courts.

poloitics  as an undercurrent is fine  it is part of everything

i rarely write overtly political

but do believe that the nature of all art is
in some way a political act

tho  please  no direct references

good political poetry ala lorca should be timeless

avoiding too many  or any direct references to the present

sometimes a sentiment filled poem like forche's can pull it off


but  hey    bush has survived thousands of years  so why
soil the piece by naming him outloud
the devil's the devil at any point in history

Just to hop on the bandwagon... when you review older books you can
better pretend that what your doing is more critical and less advertising?

I much more appreciate the reviewer that is going to call attention to
an older book that is newly relevant or just plain good. The other day I
reviewed a little comic only to find out it was years old (and yet I'd
just bought it off the rack).

In the back of my mind I imagine some kid being able to get the older
reviewed book out of the library... of course I just amble down to a
bookstore...

no, I'm not that idealist, just throwin' it out there

>>Politics has no business in writing; when we write about politics we =
take
sides. Political writing is of politics and enacts the political. It is =
a
political move rather than a stance.<<

Seems to me this depends on what you mean by "about politics" and how =
that
"about" functions in any given poet's practice. To limit our definition =
of
politics to what happens between the Democrats and Republicans in an
election or to the machinations of Congress or the Supreme Court
confirmation hearings seems to me both na=EFve and ignorant. (And I am =
not
saying, Christopher, that you did this.) Politics is also about the way =
we
interact with the world around us, the choices we make, the actions we
perform, in the family, in relation to the environment, at work, and so =
on,
and that kind of politics, it seems to me, very much belongs "in" =
writing.

Also, check out the following quote:

"Poetry can only be an exploration of ideology, not a means of =
expressing
belief in it. Re-luctant to declare his ideology as the way out of
alienation, Youssef shows how his ideology, transmuted within poetry,
generates feelings of empathy and solidarity. For Youssef then, the
commitment to justice and freedom stand beside his poetry, not above it. =
His
political values, manifested in active participation in social struggle, =
are
in reality fulfilling his abiding devotion to beauty. Justice and =
compassion
in Youssef=92s verse are presented in a sensual manner that symbolizes =
his
individualized appreciation of harmony and balance. They are aesthetic
choices first and foremost."

"Politics has no business in writing; when we write about politics we =

a
political move rather than a stance."

 My response to that quote can be presented in two simple words: horse =
shit! =20

All writing is political; all writers are politicians...the difference =
though between the outward vote gathering candidates and the inward, =
note writing scribes is the scribes don't want to stand up publically =
and be counted.  Instead, they want to be appreciated for their =
intellect. They want to stand on the sidelines and be admired for the =
brilliance of their wit and their words; they want to influence without =
the pain of disagreement or the embarrassment of losing an election. =20

Horse shit!!!=20

If writers want to send the George W. Bushs of the world into the =
bushes, they have to be willing to stand and politically be counted.  =
Hell, some of the writers in the nation need to stand up and be willing =
to run for office...how else will America ever discover its own Vaclav =
Havel?  Writers need to take more chances, not just with the creativity =
of their verbal constructs, but too with their egos in the electorate =
process.

Writing cannot stand free of the culture it partakes of - it uses
language and language is the most profound, universal expression of
any culture - and politics, like it or not,  permeates all culture and
cannot be seperated out from culture (and writing) without causing
loss to one or the other. By excising politics from your writing you
will, in my opinion, cause your writing to reflect less of the whole,
and be the lesser for it.

Funny that people have pontificated and editorialized
about Christophe's little provocation without reading
the words as fully as they might--"oil" being the
substance of so much need and desparation and
conflict, & the love object of America's "oilagarchy",
so the wish for separate water is the wish for
something very different to cleanse out beings.  My
analysis doesn't say much about what to do about all
this, but still let me say, fire up those reading

Rich, I think you have exemplified, or paraphrased, my thoughts, and the qu=
ote just about hits it on the head. I was very interested to see what peopl=
e made of the "about politics vs of politics", but I think folks over-react=
ed when they saw the word "politics" before making their (head)case. But li=
ke I'm trying to say, "enact" the political by writing, stay away from "tak=
ing a stance" by writing. There is, in my opinion, no "exploration" in stan=
ding firm. I mean, what if GWBush was on THEIR side? See, taking sides, who=
se? Who's they? Ah, colloquial stroke.=20

Please. And Steve, thanks for the "oiligarchy" reference - but I was just b=
eing literal (oil/water) - explore!

Yourses,

Christophe (and the "r" is no longer, folks)(oh, never was!)

I'm glad, Christophe, that what I wrote makes sense to you, but what you
wrote above presents to me what has always been a difficult and interesting
dilemma. Unless by "taking a stance" you mean something akin to
propaganda--and by propaganda, I should be clear, I mean everything from
advertising to the progressive, left-wing op ed pieces I agree with--then
the dichotomy you are proposing makes no sense to me. Most of the writers I
respect most deeply--poets and novelists--are those that take on political
issues in an explicit way and whose stance towards those issues is quite
clear from the work they produce. I happen to be thinking right now about
June Jordan, but I could name others, including Saadi, the 13th century
Persian poet whose work I am translating. Here, for example, is a passage
from his Gulistan. They are words spoken to a ruler who has asked Saadi to
help him out by praying with the ruler that a difficult situation the ruler
is facing be resolved in the ruler's favor. Saadi's answer is no, and here
is what he says:

"Have mercy on the weak among your own people," I replied, "and no one will
be able to defeat you."

To break each of a poor man's ten fingers
just because you have the strength offends God.
Show compassion to those who fall before you,
and others will extend their hands when you are down.

The man who plants bad seed hallucinates
if he expects sweet fruit at harvest time.
Take the cotton from your ears! Give
your people justice before justice finds you.

All men and women are to each other
the limbs of a single body, each of us drawn
from life's shimmering essence, God's perfect pearl;
and when this life we share wounds one of us,
all share the hurt as if it were our own.
You, who will not feel another's pain,
you forfeit the right to be called human.


Doesn't seem to me that you can get much more political than that, nor that
you can get any more explicit in the stance you are taking, and you could
even argue that Saadi takes sides quite explicitly, and yet I would agree
that this is not propaganda in that it does not argue for a particular form
of government or a particular ruling party, etc. Saadi was, in fact,
quite-well entrenched in the political status quo of his time. And so,
Christophe, I wonder about the terms you are using and how you are using
them.

THE WORKSHOPS:

WHAT IS WRITING?
R. M. Berry

This workshop grows out of the idea that the principal
mark of radically innovative writing is its somehow
posing the question of its own nature and existence.
This means that innovative writing is always in some
sense about itself, but this does not mean that it
is"metafiction." On the contrary, radically innovative
writing takes the question of itself into its form and
medium, making the achievement of the text a
continuous discovery of what writing is.  We will look
at three examples of formally innovative fiction and
determine how each manages to foreground the question
of itself, and then we'll try some short exercises
with disclosed frames, fake texts, narrative
displacements, self-consuming sentences,
literalizations, and other formally convoluting
devices.  In particular, we'll be interested in how
the meaning of words becomes both dizzyingly equivocal
and unprecedentedly palpable whenever what the
characters do begins to look like what the writer and
reader are doing.


NIXON REMIX
Michael Martone


Philip Roth, in his essay on American fiction,
suggested that the writers of American fiction are
often outdone by the reality of American fact.  He
concluded that the sheer invention found in the news
and in history engenders in the writer a professional
envy.  Who wouldn’t have wanted to invent Richard
Nixon let alone a character called Richard Nixon?
Roth himself uses the president in his novel Our  Gang
only to see his fiction trumped by the even more
outrageously creative script of Watergate. This will
be a course on appropriation. We will be considering
ways to use free-floating shared narratives and
characters from the collective cultural consciousness
of history, of fact in completely new
(semi-fictional?) fictions.  In a sense, we  will be
covering standards, sampling hits, importing the
goings-on of the public domain into our own private
precincts.  You might think of  this as a class on
rewriting, on revision and it will very much be
interested in satire, ventriloquism, counterfeiting,
camouflage, parody, and outright plagiarism.  What, in
fact, is a fact?  This is  a workshop about making
mythologies, fake essays and mock memoirs, and
monologues of the rich and famous about which the rich
and famous can only dream.


FICTION AS POSSIBILITY SPACE
Lance Olsen

This workshop will revolve around three generative
exercises designed to explore how one can and should
open up writing in unexpected and energizing ways.
For instance, in one concerning Narratological
Amphibiousness, we shall investigate how fiction may
become richer by living commensally alongside, in,
and/or among several forms and  genres at once. What
might happen, we shall ask ourselves, at the
intersection(s) of fiction and photography, music,
video, literary theory, poetry, hypertext, drama,
sculpture, painting? In other  words, we shall think
of fiction as a possibility space, and, while doing
so, raise questions about the creative process,
story-telling techniques, the ideas of "the workshop"
and "the critique," and current trends in the literary
marketplace, mainstream and otherwise--finally, I
hope, bringing into greater relief why and how we do
what we do, and giving rise to three nascent
narraticules a piece.


FIVE EASY PIECES: HOW TO FORM, DEFORM, AND REFORM
NARRATIVE USING THE FICTIONAL  FRAGMENT
Lidia Yuknavitch

What happens if we turn away from the idea that
narrative form must be unified in traditional ways?
Might other models of narrative form emerge which
better articulate the present?  Drawing from notions
of
narrative "micromovements" (Nathalie Sauraute), the
model of the narrative "kaleidescope" (Marcel Proust,
Marguerite Duras), and more contemporary experiments
using narrative fracturing devices and the
interruption of narrative with the visual, this
workshop will provide participants with strategies for
understanding and practicing fiction writing let loose
from mainstream meaning-making and market-driven
forms. Participants will explore the gains and losses
of using the fictional fragment to tell a story and
produce a text.


WRITING OBSESSION, WRITING AS IF OBSESSED
Susan Steinberg

If one believes that stories (and poems) must be
inspired, in part, by  obsession, by those very things
we can't keep from spinning around in our heads, then
shouldn't the writing itself reflect the
narrator's/main character's focus?  Could Ginsberg's
"Howl" have been written in rhyming couplets?  Could
Duras' The Lover have been written as an un-fragmented
text?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  In this workshop, we
will explore the ways in which various modern and
contemporary authors effectively writing
obsession/obsessively consider the inextricable
relationship of form and content, paying particular
attention to (often unconsciously chosen) rhetorical
and experimental devices:  repetition, recursion,
ranting, listing, among many others.  We will also try
for ourselves to extract the stories we find ourselves
repeatedly writing, telling, and thinking in order to
match our content, in a scene, to a form (or vice
versa), exploring the multitude of options available
to us in terms of narrative voice and storytelling.

largest publishers too challenging, innovative, or
heterodox for the commercial milieu.  Please visit us

    A few new features at www.artrecess.blogspot.com:

    -- a "mini-interview" with MIT linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle (on the Adam Fieled page). I asked them about poetry & linguistics, what's innate, what's learned, what's mysterious, and got two fascinating responses.

   -- a few new poems w/ explication (Adam Fieled) page, a Mary Walker Graham pastiche & a shameless foray into MOR metaphoric poetics.

   -- advertisement for/ preview of interview w/ Bob Perelman in Autumn '05 Rain Taxi (main page), what we talked about, and why.

   -- Mike Land's new ontological argument (Mike Land's page). We are (according to Mike) entering a new age of awareness. Don't know if I believe Mike's thesis, but I do find it interesting & worth a read.

Hi Steve, in principle, I agree with you.  Overtly political poetry tends to date quickly and requires context in an age when nobody remembers anything very long.  Nevertheless, I've written many topical or political poems over the years.  As for Bush surviving a thousand years, I hope we'll be well rid of him after his eight are up.  Maybe I know what you mean here and maybe not.  I don't see him as emblematic of our species, however.  At least, I hope he isn't.  This discussion reminds me of the TV show I saw on PBS on Monday in which Bob Dylan said he wasn't a topical songwriter and then the show shows him singing what were then topical or political songs.  Nothing is prohibited, at least not in poetry yet, I hope.  Whether Dylan is a poet or a popular musician is another matter not really relevant so I'll skip it here.

tho please no direct references

good political poetry ala lorca should be timeless

avoiding too many or any direct references to the present

sometimes a sentiment filled poem like forche's can pull it off


but hey bush has survived thousands of years so why

Friends-



Henri Breton quotes Hegel as saying:



"We have seen interest be paid sometimes to the accidents of the external
world, sometimes to the whims of personality. But, now, if that interest
goes so far as to absorb the mind in external contemplation, and if at the
same time humor, while maintaining its subjective and reflective character,
lets itself be captivated by the object and its real form, we obtain in this
penetration a humor that is in a certain sense objective"



I have found the general vicinity of this quote, which must be Section III
of _Poetics_, but I cannot, no matter how much I read this text, find the
exact moment of this quote. Was Breton typing it in from memory?
Paraphrasing?



Somebody help!

Since the industrial revolution, the alleys, sewers, and towers of the
city have provided a labyrinthine landscape that mirrors the poetic
explorations of its inhabitants. Whitman’s “I contain multitudes”
boldly points out each city dweller’s multiple ways of being in the
world. This course explores the effects of the city’s ever-changing
spaces and systems within our own writing. Readings by Cesar Vallejo,
Kenneth Koch, and Elaine Equi will be discussed.

Amy King is the author of the poetry collection, Antidotes for an Alibi,
a Lambda Book Award finalist, and the chapbook, The People Instruments.
She teaches Creative Writing and English at Nassau Community College.

This course focuses on substitution and the art of revision: how the use

and paragraphs on an otherwise linear poetic text, the role of

Kathleen Fraser is the author of more a dozen books of poetry and prose,
including Discrete Categories Forced into Coupling and Translating the
Unspeakable: Poetry and the Innovative Necessity. A professor of

JOIN THE PLANETS by Reed Bye

New and Selected Poems

226 pages		Cover by Donna Dennis

ISBN: 0-935992-23-5	$14


Reed Bye's poems have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies,
among them Out of the World, The Angel Hair Anthology, Nice to See You:
Homage to Ted Berrigan, Sleeping on the Wing and Civil Disobediences.
His previous books include Some Magic at the Dump, Erstwhile Charms,
Border Theme, Heart's Bestiary and Passing Freaks and Graces. His first
CD, Long Way Around, was released in 2005 by Farfalla Press/Mcmillian
and
Parrish. He is a professor at Naropa University's Jack Kerouac School
of Disembodied Poetics and lives, with his wife, in Boulder, Colorado.
Join The Planets contains a generous selection from his earlier books,
plus
almost one hundred pages of new poems.


"Philosophical, precise, always mindful of 'quick surprise,' Reed Bye's
poems are quite unlike anyone else's. Saying that, I think I mean that
they
are for and about and around everybody else in the poets' company that
has long delighted in their wit and musicality. There are times when
their intelligent slapstick is like James Stewart splitting a pill with
Alice,
then following her down the rabbit hole and proceeding, impeccably, hand
in hand, through wondrous narrative territories that go way beyond
doctrinaire surrealism in their absolute real-ness It is a great
pleasure
to see this substantial, long overdue collection of Reed's brilliant
works
in print."  Anselm Hollo

"Such fine work over so many years' sheer poem! Modest, undernoticed,
Reed Bye knows the ropes, holds to the adventure and shares out his
finds. All praise!"  Clark Coolidge

Join The Planets, esteemed reader, charts a history of a poet acutely
observing and exalting, in the tradition of William Carlos Williams,
the daily. Someone, a mysterious watcher watching the watcher goes
by, and suddenly the visions turn to true, a true only made possible
by poetry. Yet be prepared for a boisterous concertina, if you can hear
it amidst the lovely quietude."  Gloria Frym

"There is a kindness to Reed Bye's poetry that is impossible to separate
from the considerable skills variously on display throughout his work;
it
is part of his sense of measure, and would alone, rare quality that
it is, make Join the Planets a pleasure to engage. That Bye's poems
are rich with observation and musical range, as well as a deeply
nuanced sense of scale, raises the stakes: this is a sorely needed book,
and it is a joy to have it in the world." Anselm Berrigan

"Back up against the Rocky Mountains, on the foothills and plains
facing the great eastern sunrise, lives the poet, in his wry and modest
existence of merit and wisdom. A singer with a becoming lightness
of tone--'every notes anticipates the next.' A wakeful observant mind,
checking out the decibels of the classic wake up and fly right
think-talk of his odyssey."  Joanne Kyger

Speaking of teaching, of which I am currently doing some, a lovely class of
10 so-called seniors, maybe better called "young at heart elders" - all over
50, one or two over 70 - but anyway a peripatetic class called, "Walking &
Writing", down in the lower Market area of San Francisco - the ten of us
taking to the streets one morning a week, note and sketchbooks in hand
("Imagine that instead of a naked model in a drawing class, you have the
City before, in and around you - go at it, with it, or however it arrives
through your fingertips - words, images, conversations, involuntary
thoughts, etc.), and it's been a sheer delight - particularly in the bright
autumnal weather of late, the sun angling wonderfully in both buildings and
bodies. There I, surrounded by folks, gripping their journals and feverishly
taking note of whatever crosses ear, eye, or nose. Yes, I tell them no
talking for the first half hour.   I personally been a hound for the
signage, particularly on Market Street, of which follows below. One question
has been nagging me, of the last four lines here, were they product of a
Creative Writing Degree, and which school or poet. I find'em pretty good.
If you can get outside, I recommend 'peripatesis' as a wonderful way to
teach - specially if you and your students - we say "members" - are
hyperactive!

We are receiving a great response so far about the event in December
and great interest in the blog. We hope people will contribute to the
blog and we encourage you to email submissions or to leave public
comments. If you would like to submit, please email us at olsonnow
followed by the at symbol at gmail dot com. Our first submission is
from Clayton Eshleman: Notes on Charles Olson and the Archaic, a talk
he gave in Buffalo in 2003. Because of the length of this piece and
the formatting issues involved in reproducing Olson's poems on the
page, we have set up a Documents page at the Electronic Poetry
Center, where you can download the paper as a pdf. Thanks to Charles
Bernstein for providing the space! The link to the documents page is
at the top of the links list on the blog page.

More to come soon!

OCTOBER

OCTOBER 8		ANSELM BERRIGAN and MARIANNE SHANEEN
Anselm Berrigan's lower-than-average credit rating and empirically biased
relationship to the East Village where he grew up, lives, and works is no
reason to despise his mellow distortion and de-centered personal autocracy.
Current testimony to this Yankee fan's blatant war-mongering can be found on
Yourblackeye.org. As he is a robot, the new book of his called Some Notes On
My Programming, due to arrive sometime late this year from Edge Books, is
the horrible truth. For interview see:
www.chicagopostmodernpoetry.com/aberrigan. Marianne Shaneen's new chapbook
Lucent Amnesis has recently been released from Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs.

Note location!
Poets House, 72 Spring St., 2nd Floor
www.poetshouse.org

Renowned poet and essayist Robin Blaser articulates the philosophy of his
poetics  by considering the work of Giorgio Agamben, Jean-Luc Nancy, and
John Berger in relation to writing, politics, and transcendence. A central
figure in the San Francisco Renaissance, Blaser was born in 1925. He taught
for many years at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, where he still
resides. The University of California Press will publish his collected poem=
s
and prose next year. His books include Syntax, The  Holy Forest and The
Irreparable. =B3Retired at Simon Fraser University, 1986. Just a poet since
then.=B2
Co-sponsored by The Poetry Project. Funded in part by the Canadian Consul

Robin Blaser & Etel Adnan

A central figure in the San Francisco Renaissance,  Robin Blaser was born i=
n
1925. He taught for many years at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver,
where he still resides. The University of California Press will publish his
collected poems and prose next year. His books include Syntax, The  Holy
Forest and The Irreparable. =B3Retired at Simon Fraser University, 1986. Just
a poet since then.=B2

Etel Adnan , a Lebanese American poet, painter, and essayist, lives in
Paris, Beirut, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Among her books, the novel
Sitt Marie Rose is considered a classic of Middle Eastern  Literature. She
has been powerful voice for compassion and empowerment in feminist and
antiwar movements. Her latest book, In the Heart of the Heart of Another
Country, is a memoir told in lyrical vignettes that explores identity,
history, displacement, and war from an Arab American perspective. Adnan
writes, =B3Contrary to what is usually believed, it is not general ideas and
grandiose unfolding of great events that impress the mind during times of
heightened historic upheavals, but rather the uninterrupted flow of little
experiences, observations, disturbances, small ecstasies, or barely
perceptible discouragements that make up day-to-day living.=B2
Co-sponsored by Poets House. Funded in part by the Canadian Consul General
in New York.

-----------

Will Esposito is an editor of the literature collective Hinchas de Poesia
(Homicidal Fans of Poetry), a recipient of an Academy of American Poets
prize, and, because he lives in Philadelphia, where he teaches at Temple, a
member of the Philly Sound. His work can currently be read in Goodfoot,
Spinning Jenny, and Cross Connect. His chapbook, Friedrich Schiller Von Von=
,
is forthcoming from Katalanch=E9 Press.

Samuel Greenberg (1893-1917) was an immigrant to NYC's Lower East Side and
died at 23 after writing for only a handful of years. With a unique vision
of language often considered to anticipate surrealism, his poems over time
have found admirers in such poets as Hart Crane and John Ashbery. A new
chapbook from Katalanch=E9 Press will be released featuring a selection of
sonnets and other poems transcribed from his manuscripts.

Jackson, Chris (1967-?), was the first mannerist born in a log cabin.
Earlier mannerists had come from well-to-do families. Jackson, the son of
poor Scotch-Irish immigrants, became an orphan at 14. He grew up on the
frontier of Massachusetts. Then he moved to Tennessee, where he became a
successful sitter and viewer. Jackson won fame with no clue as to why he wa=
s
even there. He was nicknamed =B3Old Abstruse=B2 because of his toughness.

Mark Lamoureux lives in Astoria, NY. His poems have appeared in numerous
print and online publications. He is the author of three chapbooks. He is
currently seeking a publisher for his first full-length book, Astrometry
Organon.

Lori Lubeski is the author of the chapbook, Eyes Dipped in Longitude Lines,
from Katalanch=E9 Press, as well as Sweet Land, Stamina and Dissuasion Crowds
the Slow Worker. Recent poems have been published in Traverse, Carve, and
Art New England. She lives in Boston and teaches at Boston University and
Curry College.=20

Christopher Rizzo has a handful of chapbooks due out in the next year or so=
:
Claire Obscure (Katalanch=E9 Press), Zing (Carve Editions), Naturalistless
(dbqp), and The Breaks (Fewer & Further Press). He is also the editor of
Anchorite Press, which he founded in 2003. Originally from Long Island and =

Limp Richard needs no introduction whatsoever, considering his work with hi=

seminal outfit Limp Richard and The Disappointments. However, his longtime =
A

alone, leading to his current style, which Carter Buddlesby of the Entirely

Todd Carlstrom, who plays lead guitar for The Domestics and writes and
produces theatre with breedingground productions. Limp is managed by the
beautiful and cultivated Remorah.

A friend of mine, a distinguished poet, upon reading "Adam[i]n =
Paradise," wrote me that he wishes I could print it, make a scroll of =
it, or a small book. I felt angry at reading his comments. Why can't he =
get over the notion that everything has to be on paper to be =
legitimate?!  He, like I, grew up reading and writing books, as did all =
of the people who control the art and publishing worlds, and the =
foundations, many of whom, like my friend, are having trouble accepting =
digital work for what it is, much less being excited over what is being =
made and the prospects of its future.=20
This is this way with any new medium. "Why can't you paint on walls? =
What's this canvas stuff? It won't last." But with most of the world =
using computers, and not to have its art accepted, is particularly =
vexing, because what's left is technology as instrument, game, or war =
machine. As usual, art sneaks in the back door, as if a criminal.=20
This reminds me of the picture of Henry Miller in a trench coat and =
slouched hat. He liked the idea of the artist as outlaw. I do too, but =
not amongst each other! =20

William Bennett - former Bush Cabinet Secretary of Education or was it
Morals? - yesterday, on his syndicated radio program -declared that to abort
Black babies would reduce the rate and cost of crime in the United States.
Does not say this country - as it goes broke - needs to cut the industrial
cost of prisons currently used to warehouse (concentrate) the country's
African-American and poor populations. Does not say he is a racist. Does not
ask why there was not an abortionist before the birth of Tom DeLay, Donald
Rumsfeld, Karl Rove, Paul Wolfolitz,  Bill Frist, George Bush, Ken Lay, etc.
- among those indicted for crimes, soon to be, or close to being so. Does
not say he is an out-and-out racist.  Does not say, George Bush I was with
you - and I remain with you - when you ignored the white and poor blacks
unable to evacuate themselves from New Orleans.
Does not say he read Jonathan Swift without irony but belief as to the
necessity of certain kinds of solutions. Certainly indicates he read "Mein
Killer" with a certain lust in his heart.

Yes, I (too) am enraged.

stephen, what i found additionally interesting, aside from bennett's
obvious fumbling around "in the dark" (if you'll forgive me), is that
his remarks coincide partially with steven levitt and stephen
dubner's roe v. wade-friendly argument (in their best-selling
~freakenomics~) that the seeming positive correlation between more
abortions and less crime (i.e., in the wake of wade) is in fact a
positive indication that roe v. wade indeed has resulted in less
crime...

now some conservatives have taken levitt and dubner to task for not
factoring in the number of "unwanted pregnancies" that presumably
resulted from roe v. wade... yes, they would have us believe,
legalized abortion doesn't *reduce* unwanted pregnancies, it
increases them b/c of the promiscuity that results (we've all heard
this line of argument before, i'm sure)... whereas some conservatives
simply scoff at any benefit whatever to roe v. wade...

all of which casts bennett's remarks into an even, what, murkier light...

best,

MOMA REPUBLISHES IMOMF

In Memory of My Feelings-Frank O'Hara.~Edited with an afterword by Bill
Berkson. Between 1952, when Frank O'Hara published his first collection of
poems, and his death, in 1966, at the early age of forty, he became
recognized as a quintessential American poet whose vernacular phrasing, both
worldly and lyrical, beautifully told of the urban life of his generation.
In addition to the contribution he made to American literature, O'Hara was a
vital figure in the New York cultural scene and spent many years working at
The Museum of Modern Art, where, having begun by taking a job selling
postcards on the admissions desk, he ultimately became an associate curator
in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. And when he unexpectedly died,
in an accident on the beach at Fire Island, New York, he was deeply mourned
by the Museum's staff and by the New York art world. In Memory of My
Feelings was published by the Museum in 1967 to honor its late curator. The
book was edited by the poet Bill Berkson, who had been a close friend of
O'Hara's and was then a guest editor in the Museum's Department of
Publications. Berkson invited thirty artists who had known O'Hara, ranging
from Willem de Kooning to Claes Oldenburg, from Joan Mitchell to Jasper
Johns, to produce works to accompany his poems. The book was issued in a
limited edition as a set of folded sheets held loose in a cloth-and-board
folio that was itself contained in a slipcase. Now, for the first time, the
Museum has republished In Memory of My Feelings in a conventionally bound
edition, and with a newly designed paper jacket instead of a slipcase. In
every other way, however, this book is an exact facsimile of the edition of
1967.

Bennett's a gambling man, so I'd like to speculate
that he made a huge bet with someone about who would
or would not break with him for a remark with
genocidial implications, but of course the guy's just
dim.

Instead of aborting them, wouldn't it be a good idea
to cook them up and use them to feed the poor? Just
a modest little proposal from here.

Yes, J. Swift embodies the perfect vision of insanity in our time. I wonder if Bennett had any sense of irony saying those words (that it echoes the savage logic of The Modest Proposal) or he was being his old pompous self, one of the denizens in the insane asylum in The Tale Of The Tub.

I'll break out of lurkerdom long enough to note that I read about half of Mr. Javier's new book last night. If you're near San Francisco, you should be there, for sure -- something exciting is happening in ths work, and I don't really have my finger on it yet, which for me is even more exciting.

been having these debates with people ever since Freakonomics came out -- It has
LOOOOONNNNNGGGG been known that there is a rather direct correlation between
the numbers of males aged 12-28 in the population and the rate of violent crime
-- It has also lllooooonnnnggg been known that the rate of reproduction
generally in the USA had been going down for some time (hey, we're not all
family farmers anymore, duh!) -- well before the appearance of Freakonomics,
people had been looking carefully at this correlation, in part to refute those
on the right who tried to make arguments about the relationship between death
penalty laws and/or loosened gun ownership laws and the declining crime rates
-- the point is that abortion's legalization is but one, and a fairly small
one, factor in the declining USA birth rate -- many statiticians have pointed
out problems with the way that Freaknomics approaches the issue -

NOW, what's really telling about the William Bennett episode (apart from th
obvious fact that Bush must really be in a sorry state if he feels compelled to
criticize Bennett for the first time in his career), is that Bennett's defense
is that he wasn't being racist BECAUSE he wasn't really suggesting aborting
African American fetuses -- though most of us would read the fact that he
singled out black people for his discussion to have been racist in the first
place -- we could diminish the crime rate by aborting all but a few males --
that would be, to use Mr. Ethicist Bennett's words, morally reprehensible, but
he wasn't talking about all males, just black ones -- the fact that his defense
is repeated by anybody with a straight face is as worrisome as his original
comments --

'Six at the Six' at 50 -- Return of S.F.'s poetic beat=20
- Jonah Raskin
Friday, September 30, 2005=20


In cocky, competitive San Francisco, where poetry slams outdraw Sunday =
sermons, the Six Gallery poetry reading that took place Oct. 7, 1955 has =
become nearly as much a part of the city's mystique as the 1849 Gold =
Rush or the 1906 earthquake.=20

Fifty years later, however, it's nearly impossible to find someone who =
was actually there. And no one -- except rare collections at various =
libraries -- has a copy of Allen Ginsberg's legendary promotional =
postcard proclaiming "Six Poets at the Six Gallery."=20

San Franciscans tend to think of the Six Gallery reading as a happening =
and performance art, too -- something that Ken Kesey or Andy Warhol =
might have conceived in the 1960s, with colorful lights and loud music. =
In fact, the Six Gallery reading belongs to that time in the 1950s =
before TV took over, before the triumph of rock 'n' roll and marijuana =
and the advent of that highly publicized Bay Area sexuality that made =
the region a magnet for kids from all over the country.=20

There were no cameras at the Six Gallery on Oct. 7, 1955. No one that =
night took snapshots of the poets: Michael McClure, 23 and baby-faced; =
Philip Lamantia, the only San Francisco native in the group; Phil =
Whalen, a chubby Zen-like graduate of Reed College; Gary Snyder in his =
jeans, about to become a monk in Japan; Ginsberg in a jacket, looking =
like the Ivy League graduate he was; or Jack Kerouac, in the audience, =
smiling contentedly and happier than ever before.=20

Nor did anyone take pictures of the Chicago-born poet and anarchist, =
Kenneth Rexroth, who emceed the event, or Lawrence Ferlinghetti, =
recently arrived from New York -- who didn't read and wasn't even =
invited on stage and who sat in the audience feeling left out. Other =
majestic Bay Area poets weren't on the program, either -- such as Robert =
Duncan, who was born in Oakland, graduated from UC Berkeley and helped =
run the S.F. State Poetry Center.=20

If there were no photographers, there weren't any journalists, either. =
It became an instant mythical event that spread by word of mouth. The =
New York Times dispatched Richard Eberhart to report on the strange new =
poetry scene, but his rave review, "West Coast Rhythms," didn't appear =
until September 1956. By then most of the players had moved on, =
including Ginsberg, who shipped out to sea and was writing a poem he =
called "Kaddish" about his mother Naomi, who had died in a mental =
institution.=20

Kerouac mythologized the Six Gallery reading in "The Dharma Bums," =
published in 1958, a year after "On the Road." The author changed =
everyone's name: Kerouac himself appears as Ray Smith, Allen Ginsberg as =
Alvah Goldbook, Kenneth Rexroth as Rheinhold Cacoehes and Gary Snyder as =
Japhy Rider. In "The Dharma Bums," the star of the Six Gallery show is =
Snyder. He's the poet whose voice is "deep and resonant and somehow =
brave," and like the "voices of old-time American heroes and orators."=20

Ginsberg published his own account of the Six Gallery reading -- no less =
mythic than Kerouac's -- and the first major salvo in the continuing =
culture war between San Francisco and New York about who owns boasting =
rights to the Beat Generation.=20

In his essay, "The Six Gallery Reading," Ginsberg insists that the six =
poets came out of nowhere to become famous overnight, and that's not =
exactly true. Rexroth had a national reputation, and Philip Lamantia had =
a modicum of fame, especially among the surrealists in America and in =
France.=20

Ginsberg's essay also makes it sound as though the Six Gallery poets =
came together as a conspiracy to defy the New York publishing machinery. =
In fact, the gathering was more spontaneous than conspiratorial. Whalen =
appeared on the program only at the last minute, because Snyder had =
written to him in Oregon insisting that he show up or forever rue his =
absence. The reading would be a "poetickall bomshell," Snyder =
proclaimed. Indeed, it exploded the idea that New York had a corner on =
the avant-garde and boosted San Francisco as a Mecca for poets and =
poetry.=20

Beginning in the late 1950s and continuing all through the 1960s, San =
Francisco thumbed its poetic nose at New York. San Francisco laid claim =
to ownership of the Beat tradition, and East Coast poets, such as Diane =
di Prima, moved from New York to San Francisco, as though the muse =
herself had moved west.=20

Before Oct. 7, 1955, almost no one, not even Ginsberg, talked about =
defying the New York publishing industry or assaulting "national =
sobriety." That was an afterthought, in the wake of literary glory -- =
when it's easy to rewrite history and to sound more rebellious than one =
had been. It riled Ginsberg, too, that New York intellectuals, including =
Norman Podhoretz, his ex-Columbia classmate, seemed to go out of their =
way to attack him, "Howl" and the Beat Generation in The New Republic =
and Partisan Review. After Podhoretz ridiculed San Francisco's =
"know-nothing Bohemians," Ginsberg lashed out at the New York "eggheads" =
-- forgetting that he'd been a New York egghead himself.=20

Let us not forget that "Howl," though written and rewritten in San =
Francisco and in Berkeley, depicts New York people and New York places. =
No 20th-century American poem is more saturated with New York than =
"Howl." The Empire State Building shows up, and the Bronx Zoo and the =
Staten Island ferry, as though the author had become homesick and had to =
conjure the city to keep him company in far-off San Francisco. Ginsberg =
himself appears in the poem as a dreary New Yorker looking for salvation =
and drugs and excitement. In line after line, he depicts himself =
wandering about the hell that he once knew all too well on the streets, =
the subways and the rooftops of New York.=20

Although Ginsberg blossomed in San Francisco, he never lost his New York =
persona. Using all the skills he learned in marketing and advertising in =
New York, he distributed posters and put word of the event on everyone's =
lips. He chose the poets who would read, and an emcee who happened to be =
a long-time anarchist -- to keep the event in a semblance of order. He =
also took the audience by storm, performing a poem that made them feel =
that poetry was alive again, that they were alive and might speak, too, =
and that America might be reborn as a nation of poets once again, as it =
had been in the time of Walt Whitman.=20

All Americans might look back at the Six Gallery reading for =
inspiration. Perhaps the 50th-anniversary celebrations will prod us and =
poke us to read poetry and write poetry and share poetry in public in =
the spirit of generosity and respect.=20

The Six Gallery reading didn't suddenly bring about a poetry renaissance =
in San Francisco, as Kerouac claimed. The poets who wrote before the Six =
reading, including Kerouac, went on writing after. Still, it's no wonder =
that the event has taken on mythical reverberations, and that in the Bay =
Area -- which seems to experience a poetry renaissance every 15 minutes =
-- all sorts of poets trace their lineage to the Six Gallery. The 50th =
anniversary celebrations in and around San Francisco over the next week =
will only add to the myth. Of course, poets need myths as much if not =
more than anyone else. I know I do.=20

After years of reading and rereading the work that was performed at the =
Six, I've sometimes allowed myself to feel that I was there, that I saw =
and heard. Perhaps you've had that same strange feeling, too, no matter =
what coast you happen to live on, or what city you call home.=20

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."
