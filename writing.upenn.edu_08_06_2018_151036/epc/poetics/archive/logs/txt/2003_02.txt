BIG MISTAKE !! PHONE NUMBER IS 503.819.9455
NOT 503.899.9455



INVITATION

TO PHONE IN YOUR SOUND POEM

Spare Room&#8217;s poetry collective is hosting a Sound Poetry Festival in Portland, OR u.s.a. on Feb. 22nd. Among the 12 performances, we have a 20 MINUTE PHONETICATHON where we are asking sound poets from around the world to participate. We will have 3 cell phones set up for poets to call in at exactly 8:00-8:20 PM pacific coast time, USA. All 3 cells phones will be hooked into the PA system to be amplified and recorded. All 3 calls will be juxtaposed simultaneously. We are asking you to call us and voice your sound poem.

CALL:

503.819.9455   or   503.475.9256   or              503.740.6526



When you call:

1)  the phone will be answered without any talking.

2)  state your name as well as the city/state and country from which you are calling.

3)  read your sound poem for 2-5 minutes.



Please note that we will record the phoneticathon with the hopes to release the recording on CD. If you call, we assume that you relinquish permission to record your participation and release your contribution on CD. All rights revert to the author.

Staying within suggested time frame (2-5minutes) will allow us to incorporate more poets in the 20 minute period. If all phone lines are busy, we ask that you to keep trying.

The vision of the phoneticathon is to include as many sound poets from the furthest parts of the world. Please forward, copy and relay this message to other sound poets about this project! Please email me at mark_anypush@yahoo.com if you plan to call in your poem. Any questions can be sent to the same address.

Thank you,

mARK oWEns

On the other hand, s/he who hesitates is lost. I had a similar feeling about
Hamill's idea, but in the end I sent something because I know you've got to
start somewhere. We don't have Allen Ginsberg around now who knew how to get
us to laugh and remember that dissenters  have a  huge amount in common, how
to shake us out of our Hamlet-like worries and contemplative inhibitions. I
feel like I need to push through some ambivalence, dust off those old
Country Joe and Credence Clearwater records and do something! Forget about
embossed thank you notes. If George W. Bush isn't a "fortunate son" who is?

I see a bad moon risin'
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Don't go 'round tonight
They're bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

If George Bush were my son I would have suggested to him that the adult thig
to do if your wife insists on that silly poetry stuff would be to go along
and try it at least?

But if my dad said this to me I would have gone out to march or led the
troops to Cuba?

sad to say, I was at the VA today and we all looked down.

"All this dope dealin', disrespectin' our women, we've got to stop that.
Bitter cold. They're nervous about it for sure. Germany's put

"On Water Street, the outside walls of the shed thump
now and then like a bass drum with a foot pedal
at work inside it keeping the beat. In the shed
performance had begun. The upbeat grabs her neck."

Four moons of Jupiter in a straight line, rings
of Saturn, even the uneven surface of the moon

no stars, many black holes, quarry that sprawling
Orion does not even consider, bow aimed away at space

"His body could keep up somehow but it was the things
inside of him that began to strain and roar. His lungs got
so dry that they squeaked with each breath. His heart
swelled from pumping so hard. He got a little panic-

knew he had to. He wanted to die if that would get him"

In the fire den of the discovery room, Lily's got an ivy

Robert Grenier's *Sentences* are (is?) now up on the net at the Whale
Cloth Press (http://www.whalecloth.org/) web site. There is also a link
on the Grenier page at the Electronic Poetry Center
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/grenier/) that at least yesterday took
you directly to the cards themselves - but I think it makes more sense
to head first over to publisher Michael Waltuch's useful notes & it's
both fun & valuable to take a look at the images of the box itself. The
electronic site comes very close to replicating the experience of the
box itself. Each time you go through the stack, the cards will appear in
a different order. I've gone through it at least a dozen times in the
past couple of weeks, and I don't tire of the process at all.

In New York City on February 8, Grenier will be reading/slide
presentation at the Marianne Boesky Gallery
(http://www.marianneboeskygallery.com/index2.php ) in Chelsea, 535 W.
22nd Street, at 8 PM, 212-680-9889. In addition to the reading/slides,
Grenier is, in the gallery's words, "debuting 2 new suits of iris prints
of his drawn poems, and a series of photographs from the notebooks."
These editions will be on view and for sale at the gallery. The gallery
plans to keep the prints on display in its viewing room for the
following week.

Small Press Distribution, incidentally, lists *Sentences Towards Birds*,
the 1975 L Press selection, as still available at $15. This selection of
about 50 cards differs from The Box in part also because of the
typeface, a crisp Times Roman rather than the blocky Courier of
Sentences. However, as only 100 copies of Sentences Towards Birds were
printed & the SPD website characterizes it as a paperback when in fact
it is a pack of cards in a specially printed manila envelope, I would
call SPD directly before I ordered that item: 800-869-7553 (free phone
call within the United States). (http://www.spdbooks.org/ )

THURS 1/30--Trying to "combat" (with apologies to Laura Bush) poetry-tea (poetry-war)
loneliness, etc., I call NYC friend. We talk briefly but time zone's fucked up; and she, in city that never sleeps must sleep, but not before at least remarking, as if to cheer me up, that
the poetry scene's, or the poet's themselves, more boring in the Bay Area than in NYC....
but then I realized that the my favorite event of the SPT poetry season was occurring the next night, and once again, it didn't disappoint. In fact, even though it could be argued that the SF scene has many of the same in-group/out-group hierarchical social pettinesses one might have grown to expect from the NYC scene, one of the things that's so enjoyable about the poet's theatre thing is that one may see
many poets---who as readers may often be rather bland and/or "take themselves too seriously" or whatever--pleasantly surprisingly
break out of that mode and wear silly masks, costumes, and some are quite good actors---
it might even justify one's hope that there could actually end up being some viable scene here that can be loose and not all turned on itself (a la what I saw in NYC....)
Not a reivew this will be---I didn't take notes....just sat back and enjoyed the ride, and unlike last year no tedious hour long play, but 10 relatively short (all between 10 and 20 mins) plays, mostly contemporary----though it began with Andrew Joron, Garrett Caples, and Anna Naruta, digging up a YVOR WINTERS play....How weird, does anybody even read YVOR WINTERS anymore. An old teacher once told me he
studied with him, or maybe it was J.V. Cunningham, and all I remember is he's "THE MASTER OF THE COMMA" whatever that's suppossed to mean. Well, Anna's puppets had those sad faces and maybe they'll be some Yvor Winters revival. There is a Niedecker one and there were two of her plays too...
Clive Worsley (who last I'd seen as Thersities in a local TROILUS AND CRESSIDA) and Tanya Brolaski were great in a Kathleen Fraser play. The actors names aren't listed for STACY DORIS's play, but that play was a very weird family romance, with a mother screeching like a cat for most of it. Glad that Stacy's out here. SEAN FINNEY'S play was interesting stichomythia between the UBIQUITUOUS KEVIN Killian and
Brenda HILLMAN (and MIA LIPPMAN as some choral figure). David Hadbawnik's pseudo-musical (certainly like a tribute to guys and dolls, but more like GAYS AND DOLLS) about World Series was what they like to call a "guilty pleasure" in NYC....

The curators did a good job I think of balancing more narrative, easy-to-follow kind of plays, with plays that were more like "avant-garde" or at least "sophisticated" poetry that maybe need to be seen on the page to work. But even in the plays that were mostly language, rather than plot or character, driven, it was great to see poets do a pretty good job of using their body as instruments and eschewing the
talking head mode of most poetry readings----
I am so very glad Wendy Kramer has moved here; her play with Jocelyn Saidenberg
was yet another play with birds...Taylor Brady's play was perhaps the hardest to "get" with 3 voices at times reading simultaneously (maybe need to see that on page), but enjoyed seeing Sianne Ngai "ham" it up as Geoffrey Dyer and Eleni Stecopoulos played cards
Stephanie Young. Adam Tobin and K. Silem Mohammad (as Murray The Cop) all gave fine performances in Gary Sullivan's play (I wonder if Gary based Stephanie's character on his friend Laurie Price a bit...), and the finale was, along with Hadbawnik's, the most conventionally accessible, written by Wayne Smith, who I don't think I heard of before
(I thought maybe he did an Aerial book years back, but that was Wayne Kline). It ended with the theme from TOMMY.

This is not a review; is very superficial---and perhaps those not in NYC or SF will think this rather provincial, but I just wanted to say thanks to all who did it, and also ask

WHO DID THAT REMAKE OF "LOVE WILL TEAR US APART?" that was played during one of the plays----I remember that from around 1994 or something, but for the life of me forget who (I don't think it's FRENTE....)

 An Interview with Jtwine and review by Lewis Lacook.

Power and Jtwine
The splash page for his site cautions: "Be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution when visual reflections refer to you." It's an awareness of just how much of human perception is grounded in human predisposition. One piece on his site, "mindgame", opens a flash animation of a seated figure (it's one of those egg-shaped chairs, in fact, supposed to yield such comfort in the office) superimposed against an exploding color background that keeps declaring, looped, ad infinitem, "empty refill."

Lewis LaCook is our first critic in residence on Furtherfield. Offering regular and informative reviews of varied explorative projects & artworks featured on furtherfield, plus other works by artists who are currently exhibiting on the Internet.

Actually, in a common variant of the lyrics (thanks to Fogarty's
terrible enunciation), the problem is laid at the feet of lopsided
plumbing construction:

Don't go 'round tonight
They're bound to take your life
There's a bathroom on the right

And this morning, seven of what Joan Retallack might title "Icarus
FFFFFFFalling." *sigh* I've had drugs. I've had reality. I'm starting to
disprefer reality.

here's a piece I wrote as the bomnbs were falling last time around. Twelve
years old, but not much has changed.

TEACHING IN TIME OF WAR

January, 1991





                 On the day that the U.N. resolution permitting the use of
force in the Persian Gulf took effect, but before the first of the bombs
fell, I asked my composition class at Tucson's Pima Community College to
write a paper justifying Saddam Hussein's position. I explained very
carefully to my students that I didn't agree with his position, and that I
doubted that any of them did, either, but I thought that it never hurts to
understand an adversary's point of view. People risk wars because they
think that the cost is justified__even a madman in a modern technological
state can't prosecute a war against the will, or at least without the
complacency, of large numbers of his subjects. I also told my students that
the almost universally_trumpeted claim that non_Arabs are incapable of
understanding the complexities of the Arab mind struck me as a cop_out. It
seemed to me that as human beings we are morally, and of necessity,
committed to the effort to understand each other, regardless of the
obstacles presented by history and culture.
                 Nonetheless, almost all of the papers trotted out the
inscrutability theory, and several of the students respectfully declined to
fulfill the assignment, defending, instead, George Bush's position. Some of
them claimed that they lacked sufficient information to write 500 words
about the Iraqi position__they had apparently not noticed its almost
incessant presentation and interpretation, albeit with negative commentary,
in the printed media and even on the better television news programs. Still
others felt that it was somehow unpatriotic to appear to be defending an
adversary's position.
                 I was new to Tucson__I had in fact been in town less than
two weeks when I gave the assignment. Some of the reactions to the war
there surprised me. I knew that Arizona has the reputation of being a
stronghold of the most extreme conservatism, and I also knew that the
military is an important part of the community__Davis_Monthan airbase is
within the city, and a huge army base, Fort Huachuca,  is close by. I would
have expected a higher level of jingoism than I in fact encountered. What I
felt most strongly was the closeness of the war__almost everyone I spoke to
seemed to know someone on the firing line in the Gulf, and they expressed
fear for their loved_ones far more than enthusiasm for American policy.
                 There also seemed to be a division according to age. The
young, who, like my students, had never experienced a war, tended to be far
less ambivalent than their elders.
                 I use students' papers, xeroxed, but with name and
identifying information masked out, as the texts for my composition
classes. I reproduced a paper by a polite boy with short blond hair who had
defended America's decision to attack. My concern was misuse of analogy and
authority. It seemed to me that these were being used by the administration
and the media to manipulate public opinion, and my student, together with
most of his classmates, had bought into the manipulation.
                 Specifically, my student had used the Hitler_Saddam
analogy, which suggests that failure to respond promptly and violently to
the takeover of Kuwait could lead Saddam to attempt world domination, as
Hitler had after Munich. Analogies tend to blur distinctions: Hitler, after
all, was dictator of a world power, perhaps the great industrial power of
its time, with a large population and a long history of successful warfare
against other great powers, despite World War One. Saddam commands a small,
impoverished nation with no industrial base and only one significant
export. In a brutal war against a neighbor that effectively lacked an
airforce it had barely managed a stalemate. Saddam would have to be
considerably crazier than we like to think Hitler was to imagine himself
with that class of political potential, but the analogy would be a good
selling pitch for our administration if it remained unexamined.
                 My student had also quoted Billy Graham to the effect that
"we must have military power to keep madmen from taking over the world."
Putting aside the authority that might attach to the person of Graham in my
student's mind, the quotation begs three questions: who are the "we"
referred to, who diagnoses the madmen, and who decides which madmen
exercise that kind of threat.
                 I set out to make these points about uncritical acceptance
of the language of politicians, but between the assignment and that day in
class serious fighting had broken out, and while I made efforts to make
clear that my criticisms were not political per se, I probably made my
points too vehemently, distressed as I was. At any rate, there was a moment
during the class when I became aware that the student who had written the
paper was undergoing a transformation__I was really seeing it happen, but
the protocol of the classroom prevented me from intervening until the hour
was over. His posture and expression stiffened, and his eyes went dead. The
hard, impenetrable wall of hatred had descended.
                 I recognized immediately what had happened__I had seen it
often enough during the Vietnam War. Although the scale of our political
differences was relatively small, in his mind I had become one of those
intellectuals who humiliated people like him. It was a class division: I
had become the enemy.
                 My God, I thought, I've lost him, and I was so bereft that
for a moment I imagined myself falling uncontrollably.
                 My student left the room immediately after class, but I
promised myself that I would speak with him after our next class. All
weekend, while the jets played tag over the city, flying in formation in
preparation for the killing field, I rehearsed different strategies for
approaching him, hoping against hope that I could breach that wall before
it hardened into permanent antagonism to anyone who carried authority and
differed from his received opinions. I thought, if I can save the
flexibility of this one mind I would have accomplished something in the
face of the disaster that was befalling us.
                 My student didn't show for class on Monday. Filled with
apprehension, I awaited Wednesday's class. Still he didn't show. I had lost
him. He never came back to class.
                 Sometime during the following week I was having a beer
with a friend. He had been in Vietnam while I was picketing. "Hell," he
said, "everybody in Arkansas signed up. We didn't know what we were doing,
we just wanted to get away from home." He thought that now that we had
begun the battle we had better stay and finish, and that there could be a
positive outcome__America's self_esteem could at last rebound from the
slough of Vietnam. And he seemed to think that the sacrifice of lives, ours
and theirs, was worth the gain. And I realized that somewhere along the
line I had stopped dividing the dead into ours and theirs.
                 I think it was that night that the war came home to me. I
was eating dinner by myself, my mind drifting over this and that, when I
suddenly found myself exclaiming out loud, "Shit, we're in another war." It
was as if I had found some sort of key, and I was flooded with grief. I
began sobbing. All of the turmoil of the Vietnam War, not just the deaths,
but the hardening, the destruction of hopes at home in America; and the war
before that, and its attendant cold war, with its red scares that had
played out in my fantasies as a giant pogrom (the terror that accompanied
the trial and execution of the Rosenbergs typifies that time for me, not
the question of guilt or innocence, but the lynch_mob glee in the streets
and the newspapers); and even my few memories of the war before that, my
father's war, that killed his friends and corrupted him and my childhood,
came flooding back. I remembered the riots at Columbia, where I had been
knocked unconscious by a cop's blackjack, the endless protests, and the
march on the Pentagon, where, staring into the muzzles of the machine guns
trained on us from emplacements on the roof, for a brief moment I thought
that fundamental changes were possible. I remember that it felt as if the
whole several hundred thousand of us had climbed a tall mountain to get to
the ridiculously small fence that was supposed to keep us out, which, by
the time I reached it, had been flattened under the multitude of feet; once
crossed, we broke from our narrow parade ranks and spread out across that
lovely grassy field, the late afternoon sun beginning to set before us, so
that we were silhouetted, glowing at the margins as if transfigured.
Everybody, it seemed to me, was smiling__we had made it to the gates of
power, and we hadn't been killed, they couldn't kill us. And up front, at
the ledge that dropped down from the paved forecourt of the Pentagon,
dozens of people were scaling ropes to get closer, and they seemed suffused
with joy and youth, and maybe the walls would really crumble, and maybe we
could find a way to live beyond the narrowest expediency, and the
brutalization, the victimization, that happened to all of us in those
slaughtering times, could end.
                 And I remembered the swift disappointment of those hopes,
from which I have never recovered.
                 In my deepest self, I had never imagined that we would
ever fight another war.
                 Back at school a few days later, I went into the cafeteria
to grade some papers. All of the tables were occupied, and I asked a man of
about my age if he minded my joining him. I had sat down and begun sorting
my things, when he asked me, "Were you in 'Nam?"
                 Until his question, I hadn't really noticed him. He was a
tall man in soiled clothes with an unkempt beard, and he had before him a
literacy textbook. He looked as if he might have been a long_term client of
the local Veteran's Hospital.
                 I answered his question. No, I told him, I had been a
student during the war.
                 We talked politics for a moment. He backed what we were
doing in Iraq, he said, but his voice, his eyes, his entire manner seemed
unsure. I told him I disagreed, not so much about our goals as about our
methods.
                 "But the worst thing for me," I said, "is the flashbacks.
I guess it's even worse for you. I think about it all the time, and I've
started having nightmares. I never thought we'd be here again, and I'm
angry as hell. But mostly I'm just sad."
                 "Yeah," he said.
                 We sat together for a while in silence, mourning.

This morning I awoke anticipating mourning but.  Found on pressing the 'on'
button two notes on sentencing from CA via langpo and from TX via britpo and
can feel the creep of wordgames coruscating but then Columbia falls on TX
and we obsess on technologies via technologies ad infinitum.  Sentience is a
capacity, I feel in my gut as i extend a poem toward even those who might
not see it.

Not only that, but I thought the rhetorical stance of Bush's speech was
actually quite powerful, especially for a speech on the fly.

But i will only be able to open up my new account monday

I still get only a blank screen, and otherwise a message saying my browser
is too old even though it is the latest OE 5.01! I guess that means the
piece won't work on a Mac. Sadness, as I really love this work.

Glad you find it interesting Gabe.  I should say that, although it has some of
the qualities of a send-up (and if you're speaking of the particular piece "The
Mainstream Movement" I can't claim authorship of that - I did write the poem
"Mainstream Poetry" which is modeled on Baraka's "Black Art"), the people
involved in the mainstream poetry movement do not, as far as I can tell,
consider themselves parodists (I certainly don't write parodies)and, in
particular, their claim to being mainstream is completely sincere, though they
themselves are not.  The best explanation of this can be found in a piece Kasey
Mohammad wrote for his "limetree" blog.  Hopefully it will go up on the
"Mainstream" site soon.     -m.

Chris,

The version of "Love Will Tear Us Apart" in my play was a Swans remake
from the late 80s oe early 90s, with Jarboe singing (I believe they've
also covered it with Michael Gira on vocals).

Subject:      How to tell if your poetry is choking
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

If you observe "conscious" Poetry choking:


-Ask, "Are you choking?"

-If the poet can speak, cough, or breathe, DO NOT INTERFERE.

-If the poet CANNOT speak, cough, or breathe, give sub-diaphragmatic
abdominal thrusts (the Mainstream maneuver) until the foreign body is
expelled or the poet becomes unconscious. (Or in case of extreme obesity or
late pregnancy, give chest thrusts.)

-Be persistent.

-Continue uninterrupted until the obstruction is relieved or advanced life
support is available. In either case the poet should be examined by a
physician as soon as possible.


PREVENTION IS NO ACCIDENT


To perform the Mainstream maneuver, the following steps should quickly be
taken:

  a.. Stand behind the poet who is choking.
  b.. Place your arms around their waist and get them to bend forward at the
waist.
  c.. Clench one hand into a fist and place it over the person's belly
button, or navel.
  d.. Place the opposite hand on top of the first.
  e.. Thrust both hands at the same time backward into the stomach with a
hard, upward movement. In those who are extremely obese or pregnant, the
hands should be centered over the person's chest and chest thrusts should be
given instead of stomach thrusts.
  f.. Repeat the thrusting movements every few seconds until the object in
the person's windpipe is coughed up and expelled from their mouth. The
Mainstream maneuver should also be stopped if the person becomes
unconscious.

One more slight correction -- Tanya Hollis, not Tanya Brolaski, acted in
Kathleen's play.

Also, we're hoping to get some decent video copies of the evening, so if
anyone on the list is interested in seeing some unexpectedly wonderful
acting, great writing by (mostly) first-time playwrights, and me
breaking my arm in the middle of the Niedecker play, let me know
backchannel. And for those in the area, remember that we still have one
night to go, this Friday. Make reservations -- we sold out the theater
last night.

I don't think Joel W. was saying it was *funny*. It is just weirdly
ironic that of all the possible towns that had to suffer debris from
this horrible accident, one of them had to be called "Palestine."

If you really want to see fucking sick fucks, check out the debris
auctions that have been on eBay since at least early this afternoon.

Had Joel W. been an actual fucking sick fuck, he might have quoted one
of the original round of Challenger jokes, such as:

Q. Where did Christa McAuliffe spend her vacation?
A. All over Florida.

Joel wasn't the only one to note the irony of the place names. Again, I
still think he wasn't calling it humorous, just ironic. There are a lot
of other nonfunny ironies in the world.

turning 60 -

The last of days I'm 59, I'm reading as follows - and
now listen carefully from The Honorable Jacob Willsey's Journal,
1831--1860, I'm not sure where to put the line breaks in (not
the quotation, but this domain where history and thought
lose one another) -

On October 28, 1831 - "Mr. Clark sawed in the mill 1 week, pd. him $3."
Now listen, November 6, 1830 - "Clark quit; Warren went to Dryden; wrote
to H. Warren in Pittstown; Gaylord on the RRoad at Tinneros; Gaylord went
to Ithaca on the RR."

Who is Clark? Now again February 2, 1831 - "Weather warm and thaws today;
people flock like pigeons to a wheat field to see Clark hung; snow runs
fast; bot 2 pr boots and 2 pr shoes of Mr. Smith, Springville, Pa. for
6.75."

Then - on the day of my birth, 112 years early, February 3, 1831: "All
hands went to Ithaca to see Clark hung; carried a clock to R.  Jennings;
warm, thawy weather; I went to the mill and cut ice to save the dam."

The same Clark or another? The weather of ice, as here against the
Susquehanna, merganser ducks around, ice beginning to break against the
culverts speeding the water downriver, huge flows of free water.
February 1, 2003, spent the afternoon rephotographing the muskrat lodge.

Which Clark? Of this, no other record, the same or different? In the
Journal, accorded a mention, and now 1835, Utica, New York, near Ithaca;
William Williams publishes a new edition of The English Reader or Pieces
in Prose and Verse; selected from the Best Writers: Designed to Assist
Young Persons to Read with Propriety and Effect; to Improve their Language
and Sentiments, and to Inculcate some of the most important Principles of
Piety and Virtue: by Lindley Murray.

A select sentence: "Mixed as the present state is, reason, and religion,
pronounce, that, generally, if not always, there is more happiness than
misery, more pleasure than pain, in the condition of man."

Another: "Time, once past, never returns: the moment which is lost, is
lost forever. There is nothing on earth so stable, as to assure us of
undisturbed rest; nor so powerful, as to afford us constant protection."

Here at the dusk of my 50s, I wonder, who is Clark? The first edition of
Lindley's book was 1822; did Clark or Jacob Willsey glance upon it? In
January, 1859, on the first day of the new year, Willsey writes:

"1--Comes in Moderate. El Wilcoxen is about leaving of us & going to
Lisle.  Started the 14th with his wife, which leaves us destitute of
preaching. He has been here 11 years & I fear we shall not get another
preacher to supply his place soon as our church has run down & but few
members & they are more engaged after the things of the world, than they
are after their soul salvation. Oh what the results will be is yet hidden
in the future. I feel that my days are very few & full of trouble, And my
labour is about done and I have nothing but the promise of a crucified
Saviour to rest upon and in Him I put my trust, believing that He will not
afflict us willingly more than we are able to bear."

This next morning of the 3rd will be dark, black beyond belief; I shall
neither see nor comprehend. Debility awaits me & I cannot call on God.

Subject:      How Mainstream Is It?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

HOW MAINSTREAM IS IT?

It's not enough that we should succeed: Everyone else must fail.
We want ads EVERYWHERE: It's not enough that
Linford Christie once wore the Puma logo on his
Contact lenses. Or that "we" served in Vietnam, the Gulf War
Neither is it "enough" that we're the most environmentally
Contaminated place in the Western Hemisphere, nor that
We pick apart everything Tiger Woods does on the Golf Course.
It's just not enough to go around weepy and confused.

A "for instance": Mr. Potato Head's naked & fellating Tiger Woods.
Is that enough? Every year 1000s of mice, rats and guinea pigs
Are injected with chemicals to see if they do actual damage to
Organs. That's why we have to be witnesses. It's not
That we *personally* have experienced forgiveness of sin.
The hoi polloi require creators re-invent themselves
& that we routinely lead them w/the tools and processes we have.

And they have to PAY FOR the writing, the EU haircuts
Otherwise, people simply turn away from us & we are
Neither too good nor too bad & are simply recycled--
Pardon? What do you mean, "Is that not enough"?
You might as well ask, "Is it enough that the shower heads in
The women's locker room are at chin-height, that
Our poems are endlessly overacted, tirelessly over-emotive
& pedantically ... melodramatically... morbidly contrived?"

If everyone's going to be like that, the stadium must be named after
Some stupid product: "The Ban on Meat-based Feeds,"
"After September 11," "Grandstanding & Witless Protest Signs."
It's not enough that they invite us into their homes, to "live in
Texas" with them. The key word here is "constantly."
Must we constantly start over? Are we any closer to God?
Why must we constantly prove ourselves? Must we constantly
Be on guard against those "experts" who seem to think we are
Totally inept and idiotic by virtue of being sheepish?

Human Destiny tells us that, just as we fashion laws to meet our
Emerging needs, so must we constantly reexamine and revise
Our poetry, and that our poetry not be at war with our "customers."
We simply can't depend on the same individuals year after year
To do the work. Poetry is too often used to solve specific
Applied problems. Why must we constantly build new functions?

Have we not hearts big enough? Must we constantly revert to the
Eighteenth century or, preferably, the seventeenth?
Is *that* why we intoxicate ourselves? Distract ourselves?
Constantly bombard each other with crap? Why must we
Pit ourselves *against* crap? Does crap prevent us from seeing
"The Big Picture"?

Can't we learn to enjoy the simple pleasures of helicopter noise?
Must we constantly compare our helicopters to
Other helicopters? Why must we constantly theorize about helicopters?
Are they an appropriate code for living? Are they even
"Realistic"?

We talk as if thought was precise and emotion was vague
As if thought were a function of understanding
As if there were no hand there to guide the scalpel's cutting
As if thought were something "plunged into a sea of words
& come up dripping." Do thoughts even work? Thought ought
To be the most democratic of arenas, but has become
Just another obscure professional specialty, the corpse wheeled away,
The kidneys, the glands, the bruised heart--all tossed into a saucepan.

As poets, we need to embody wisdom, dignity, freedom & love
Helping others to own these values, to reach the point
Where they are ready to embark on their own lives, free of social roles.
We need to embody regeneration through the synergy of
Expressive breath, sound and movement. We need to transform
What we are restoring, and to ask these questions with great
Patience and intention, to embody them, to live them
& to support programs that foster great patience and intention.

RIGHT NOW is an extremely important time for the "Core Self."
We need to embody the whole of our human nature
To devise systems of rules (selves) which describe how language
Works; we need to embody--to give birth to--all of our "selves."
We have many selves: the image (fantasy/memory/dream) self,
The physical self, the soul. It's time [APPLAUSE].
With this in mind, we can better prepare ourselves for the future
Adopt policies of dignity, inclusion, and fair treatment [APPLAUSE].

Each self is different [APPLAUSE]. They are each different
& we need to embody those values in our new laws [APPLAUSE].
If hope is going to be more than a theological theory, we need to
Embody, in the dramatic pattern each of us of calls, "my life,"
These values *as* legislation, because the court will not do it
For us [APPLAUSE]. We need to embody choreographers [APPLAUSE]
so that way we may understand the world more in "human" terms.
We think that is the point. For you and I to live an effective life
We need to embody successful consumer driven initiatives (principles)
So as to "get" a grasp of the kinds of connections and relations between
Things. [APPLAUSE.]

Somewhere around Barstow

The Iranian assured us that all spent fuel would be returned to Russia.
The Visitor's Center was closed, so we had to go on
without maps, without guidance. The media tried to fill
the emptiness within us, but even the launching of moon orbiters

failed to do the trick. We thought we'd settled
on a political blueprint for our nation's future, but even that
didn't pan out, though a conference hall full of astrophysicists had worked
on it day and night for several weeks. Either the surface had been dried

out by solar heating and maturation, or the dark soot-like material that covers
Barstow's surface masked any trace of Arizona black ice. But still the road
uncoiled before us until we surpassed it and it slithered away behind us
in our rear-view mirror. The boundaries between counties hereabouts

were not well marked, and we usually slid from one right into the next
without warning, tours no longer being offered until further notice.
The Humans in Space Symposium had been cancelled,
stirring up a hornet's nest of activity among those impacted.

In Arroyo City, we stopped to gas up, and to check out Arizona's claim
that it had no nuclear or biological weapons programs, a claim
we strongly doubted. Now that we pay at the pump, we never see any
of the locals anymore, and everything else was underground

except, of course, for the old, burnt-out roadhouse across the road
from the pumps. Hand in hand, a column of kindergarten children
marched by us, headed out along the road we'd followed
into town, vanishing into the heat vapors rising from the pavement

and the desert floor. Where they were headed we had no idea.
Our newly bolstered inspection team visited a former nuclear facility
forty-six miles south of Flagstaff. This, I thought, is eternity.
A policeman biking past smiled, "The ball's in the bad guy's court now."

Dear Alan,

I hope you enjoy to the full this last day of being 59.  Tomorrow you
will be 60 and incredibly wise and ancient, and I will have to consult
you.

If you were in Ireland, you could be elected a saoi, which is a sort of
venerable old artist to whom all the artists, theoretically anyway, pay
homage.

But seeing you're not in Ireland, I'll bring a bit of Ireland to you in
the form of this early 19th century poem by Rafteiri an File, or Raftery
the (what else) Poet, which all Irish children of my generation learned
at school.  St. Bridget's Day is the second of February, which marks the
first day of spring in Ireland:

Anois teacht an Earraigh
beidh an lá dúl chun shíneadh,
Is tar eis na féil Bríde
ardóigh mé mo sheol.
Go Coillte Mach rachad
no stopfaidh me choiche
Go seasfaidh me sios
i lar Chondae Mhaigh Eo.

Now that Spring is coming
the day will be stretching out,
and after St. Bridget's Day
I will raise my sail.
I'm going to Kiltimagh
And I will never stop
Until I plant my feet
in County Mayo.

It's a five-stanza poem, and the other bit which my memory has retained
over the years is the second half of the third stanza, in which the poet
praises the lushness and fertility of his home town -- everything grows
there, blackberries and raspberries, and:

Is da mbeinse i mo sheasamh
i gceartlar mo dhaoine
D'imeodh an aois dion
is bheinn aris og.

If I was standing
in the heartland of my people
Age would flee from me
and I would be young again.

Also, Alan, if you were in Kerry, you'd be able to have a whale of a
time for your birthday.  Here's the sort of thing they do around there
this time of year:

An Bhrídeog ~ The Biddy

"The Biddy" and "The Capall" are the big traditional festivals in Uíbh
Ráthach. Téann grúpaí ar fud na dúthaí ag déanamh spraoi agus iad
gléasta ionas nach féidir iad d'aithint. Leis an spórt seo, cuirtear
fáilte roimh an Earrach.

Carrying a "brídeog" or "capall" as appropriate groups go from house to
house and pub to pub on St. Bridgid's Eve and St. Brigid's Day. They
play music, dance and sing, remaining disguised all the time.

Carpe diem or let it seize you.

thanks for phrasing it that way, Alan.  It gives me a couple of weeks to
view it as an action or process rather than event, myself.

truth be told I never thought I would get here and never dreamed it would be
in student ousing in the heartland
but
it could be a birthday, new life, new course to take.  at the same time i
wish the good old USAcentre would be really reborn rather than born again
but this is no longer my concern as my progeny have tools to wrestle and I
can turn to food stamp bureaucracies and med regimens.

there's probably a poem or meditation there
but
then again maybe not?

Subject: RE: America_Has_Gone_Insane?_(John_le_Carre)


Phillip Roth was interviewed in the Empoli based La
Nazione recently. Among the things he said (and I
translate from the Italian):

[Speaking of the US after 9/11]: "America has become
more aggresive and fearful, more closed and more sad.
There's a widespread violence and a great desire for
violence. And a racism that is by now out in the open,
but disguised as an obsession with attacks, as a fear
of confronting the potential dark skinned terrorist."

[Speaking of the intellectual climate]: "There is less
courage, less discussions, the contacts among writers
less frequent and less intense. There is a sort of
self-censorship, as if we are in the presence of an
invisible enemy ready to take advantage of our
weaknesses: and the truly contrary positions are
avoided. I think today a real intellectual debate is
difficult...

I'd say that the terrorist nightmare has unleashed
among Americans impulses that before were only latent.
Self-centeredness, obtuseness and aggressiveness are
smouldering under the appearance of a free and open
society.

[Speaking of the US leadership]: It will seem
paradoxical, but I believe that men like Bush, like
general Powell, or Condoleeza Rice or Cheney are the
most legitimate and natural expression of today's
America. They are our inevitable rulers, the only ones
suitable to represent the mentality of the majority of
our society.

[On Bush's war]: I'd define it as oedipal: Bush wants
to complete and surpass the work of the father. Bush
Senior made war in the Gulf but could not capture
Hussein and reach Bagdad: now his son wants to achieve
this aim and have a greater place in history.


[NOTE: My forwarding of Roth's message (or any other message for that
matter) does not constitute endorsement of that message.-PH]

Dear George



This is a good idea, however I believe that my statement did exactly as you
suggest, express and enquire, within the bounds of the common (vulgar)
tongue. My initial reaction was one of rage and then I realize that I over
reacted and owned up to it. But now I will explicate in a manner fitting to
his Honor, the Poet Laureate of Canada.



Ilan Ramon http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/bio_ramon.html a colonel in
the Israeli Air Force and a former F 16 squadron commander; his mother is a
Holocaust survivor of Auschwitz and his father fought in the War of
Independence. Ramon took into space "something that would symbolize the
Holocaust survivors and those who did not survive." One of those items was a
tiny Torah scroll. "It is a small Torah scroll that 60 years ago a little
boy in Bergen Belsen received from the rabbi of Amsterdam. The rabbi taught
him from it for his bar mitzva. That 13 year old boy read the weekly portion
from this Torah. It was with him since then. That boy, Yehoyahin Yosef,
survived the Holocaust, arrived in Israel, fought in the country's wars and
then went on to become a distinguished professor of planetary physics." Ilan
has also brought a picture of the Earth as seen from the Moon, which was
drawn by a young boy who died in Auschwitz. Full story here.

Now this man is dead in an act of sentimentality. And in their reentry over
the US airspace being near Palestine is an odd thing to point out from a man
whose name means House of the Wise. That is irony. OR even, a funny might be
found in the CNN reporter's name Miles O'Brien is that of a Star Trek The
Next Generation character.



Best, Geoffrey

Subject:      regarding dung
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

"Why must we/ Pit ourselves *against* crap?" -- Gary Sullivan


1.      Yes, why must we do this: Is there not something democratic about
the earth itself? Are not fertilizer and manure, though repulsive, not
fertile?
1.1.    Does any one of us deny a daily or a near daily intimacy with dung?
And do we not carry it into the halls of parliament inside a bag God has
slung between our thighs? It is there with us always, yet we practice an
apartheid against this substance, an apartheid at once so subtle and
demoralizing that great havoc is wrecked in our daily life.
1.2.    The effort we expend in our avoidance of thoughts about dung is
incalculable. Many of us refuse to read about dung. The moral and
linguistic trenches and fretworks arrayed against dung are pervasive and
seemingly insuperable. Indeed, the very word "shit" begins with the palatal
voiceless fricative onomatopoeic imperative to be quiet: shh!
1.3.    Many will praise and worship an idealized conception of God, yet
the very paste of life cannot go unreviled.
1.4.    Dung and death, procreation and violence: these are the actual
signposts and borders of life. Rarely do we see them come together except
in a battle of sex and shit-throwing in a cemetery.
1.5.    Shame about dung is a frivolous and gratuitous shame, wasted shame,
empty shame. Should not shame serve to correct our action, steer us from
immorality and evil, rather than provide us merely a feeling of intense and
impending embarrassment about an odorous paste? I submit that inasmuch as
the shame of dung is the first impractical shame, it is the beginning of
frivolity. What's more, it follows then that those adult pursuits
recognized in every age for their frivolity (fashion, for one) are merely
embellishments upon, and excrescences of, dung shame. Vanity itself is but
a false sense of triumph over one's dung.
1.6.    Shame of dung is therefore improper shame, insofar as it supplants
or is used as a surrogate for proper, useful, substantive shame. Our
collective cultural feelings (aversive and prissy) and representations
about dung embody, then, a failure of spirituality.
1.7.    In those people for whom dung is shameful, the depths of disgust
and the heights of vanity meet midway at a point called righteousness. And
I fucking hate righteousness. Here's your dung poetry, prissy boy! perfect
girl!
1.8.    The fact of the matter is dung has fought back with great
artfulness, vitality, craft and agility at precisely those moments in
history when proper shame has been suppressed by not only frivolous shame
but the cultural features that attend shame, such as violence,
officiousness, and the like. This occlusion of proper shame suppresses
gratitude, pragmatics, use, and decency. And shame of dung is a sign of
their absence.
1.9.    It is no mistake that those who are officious, militantly decorous,
prissy, priggish, and rule-bound are often called "anal-retentive." These
are usually, furthermore, either secretively or openly pompous people;
pomposity inheres in them, and this is because they suffer from a frivolous
and incorrect shame, a shame that supplants true shame.
1.10.   It could be argued that prissiness is at base a kind of timidity.
But dung-based prissiness is a more militant kind of prissiness, insofar as
it carries brittle attitudes specifically to procreation and defecation.
These attitudes however are typically not obvious or strong enough to
express in writing nor do the prissy wish to see them expressed either. It
is interesting that the relationship between prissiness and timidity is
that prissiness is a timidity of the butt.
1.11.   So, prissiness is less than an issue of misplaced shame as it is
the fear that one's frivolity will be challenged. For who wants to be
considered frivolous? Dung is never frivolous, and it is therefore suitable
that poetry should be defended by dung. Dung is factual. It is very real,
and the dismissal of dung is frivolous insofar as it is futile. The
official world is a dungless world.
1.12.   All of which is not to say that there are not honest and legitimate
negative reactions to dung. Dung is afterall disgusting. But serious grave
and moral and national and political and rural issues arise once what is
physically disgusting is not understood as something merely physically
disgusting, but is instead confused with the aesthetically, morally, and
nationally reprehensible.
1.13.   Prissies believe they are about law and order, when in fact they
are merely trying to plant feeble colonies of disgust in inappropriate
regions. These prissies are dolts. (That is one class of prissy, the dolt
prissy.)
1.14.   But what are these "inappropriate regions"?: Comedy; The North;
Decency; Urbanity; Sanity--anything, that is, outside the realm of
television. Television is "the South"; television is prissiness. TV is the
South inasmuch as "the South" is a collectively prissy response to
wilderness (the swamps of MS and LA, eg), the other (the poor, the
African-American, the non-Anglo-Saxon, the feminized female, the
masculinized male, John Grey notwithstanding), and, well, the facts
(reality, eg).
1.15.   Let us be plain: There is something inherently retarded about
America. And the reason for this has principally to do with our
relationship with our dung.
1.16.   They who feel frivolous disgust and frivolous shame are put off by
dung in poetry. As prissiness is a display of frivolous disgust and/or
frivolous shame, so also is machismo a display of resistance to disgust and
shame. But insofar as machismo is yet another reactionary response to shame
and disgust (with a key additional reaction to fear), I must classify it as
a type of prissiness.
1.17.   By contrast, there is something very "can do" about dung. Dog-faced
and down-at-heel, dung is nothing, yet from it issues life. It is a kind of
womb therefore. It is a cross between a paste, on the one hand, and a womb
on the other. Indeed, the rectum, whence comes dung, is itself a shadow
womb. Metonymically then, a dung is a boy. Or a dung is a girl. Dung are
therefore shadow children, adumbrated offspring. The procreative aspects of
dung hinge not only upon its biological properties, but its metaphorical
properties. It is a rich and confusing substance. So, out of respect for
its complexity, its signification, its use, and our long companionship with
it, we ought not either wrinkle or raise our noses at it.
1.18.   A perfect example of denial-of-dung art is Nashville country music.
Yet even there we see defecatory qualities: the moaning of the mullet cuts,
the tinkling of the steel guitars.
1.19.   Beyond shame, there is a very strong fear associated with dung.
Consider that a creature is, when defecating, very vulnerable to attack. To
many idiots, then, dung is what one produces when one is weak, it is a
product of weakness. But some, I think, feel that a dung is an expulsed
wound. That in surviving the act of defecation without being clubbed, the
dung represents a wound one had avoided altogether. It is a wound at once
avoided and voided.
1.20.   Thus, given his druthers, mankind will choose to dung inside a
fortified structure. You might argue that the fact that we chose to situate
our dunging machines inside houses is indicative only of a preference to
dung in a warm room, outhouses being cold more than half the year in those
climes where the flushing dung bowl was devised. I concede this is a strong
argument: it does seem axiomatic that one is more likely to freeze to death
in an outhouse than be clubbed to death in it. But I refute this theory.

Do you think cubism influenced literature (or vice versa)?  Help me win a bet.

What books or texts can you recommend that will show me in what ways
cubism influenced literature?  And also, what writers were influenced
by cubism?

Please back channel all this information, because it is important
that I win this bet.

I know as much as the average person about cubism and about
literature, but I call upon you to help me on this one topic.

Thanks everyone.

a little off the mark, perhaps, but this is why i find whitman's
"this compost" (1856) one of the more amazing u.s. poems of the 19th
century...

Dear Kevin,

       Well, how about Stein and Max Jacob?  In an article by Jayne Walker,
titled ""Tender Buttons: The Music of the Present Tense," (The Making of a
Modernist, U of Mass Press, 1984), Walker makes reference to the first Cubist
collage, "Still Life with Chair Caning," which contains a piece of cloth with
the printed pattern of chair caning and a piece of rope around the
canvas--she claims that within months after Picasso created this collage,
Stein invented the style she used in Tender Buttons.
       I think scholarship generally asserts that visual Cubism slightly
precedes verbal.  I've devoted part of  a course  I'm teaching at CCAC to
these relationships.
       Max Jacob, I think, comes close to being neck in neck with Picasso.
In 1901 he went to an exhibition of a then unknown artist named Pablo
Picasso.  Later he recommended P to an art dealer he knew.  Then there's the
legendary room mate story of Bateau Lavoir.  Jacob was writing The Dice Cup
between 1903 and 1907, though it wasn't published as a book until 1917.
       Does this help?  What kind of bet, with whom, and how much?  (You can
call me at home to give me the details if you don't want them made public,
sweetie).

Love, Gloria Frym

THIS COMPOST is a masterpiece!  i've heard poets complain about it by way comparing it to Whitman's other work, saying it's not as celebratory.  well, whatever.  i actually disagree that it's NOT celebratory, but i don't want to argue that point, which seems so silly to me.  THIS COMPOST has all the vigor of the ORIGINAL texts, before he edited and edited his way into the good gray poet stance.

Gary Schmidgall, a recent Whitman biographer, published a few years ago the fully unexpurgated earlier texts of LEAVE OF GRASS for the first time in many years.  most of these versions have been unavailable to us for decades.  it's quite different from the Whitman i remember reading in class years ago.  wow, is it different, luscious and salacious, a definite revolutionary emblem for our bodies and our loves and lives.

I didn't say he wrote it.  I was responding to a rather brash comment
about the administration's stance vis a via Columbia, and was commenting
that the speech--whether read off a teleprompter or written by someone
else (like all recent presidential speeches) or not--was rhetorical
powerful, and in fact quite poetic.

I guess I feel the need to defend my posiiton a little more, though not
sure quite why.  I'll I'm trying to say that, regardless of your political
leanings, the speech (though poorly delivered) was a good one and lacked
any sense of the war-mongering that some suggest.  And though it was
tinged with religion, it was not a fundementalist view that was was
present in those last few paragraphs.  The quote from Isaiah was
particularly effective, given that the speech was being delivered to
Isreal as well as the US.  And the way in which the speech tied man's
scientific yearning for understanding--"Mankind is led into the darkness
beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery and the longing to
understand"--was neatly paralleled with religous doubt and hope in the
last lines: "The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to
Earth; yet we can pray that they are all safely home."

Look, I'm not supportive of the way the Administration is handling the
current global crises either, but the speech was very well meaning and
well crafted.  To blindly reject anything put forth by the administration
does just as much damage as blindly accepting it.

Well, that is certainly better, and I thank you for it.

Though I have to say that I don't really see that carrying a
religious fetish object into space makes for a positive, any more
than I like the bible-mongering in your president's speech this
morning. My guess is that some pilots of the Israeli gunboat
helicopters are carrying religious items, and that so are some Syrian
fighter jet pilots.

Jacob described himself as a cubist poet. There's a lot of writing about
what this means--almost every introduction to Jacob collectionms in French
and English. A good place to start would probably be Gerald Kamber, Max
Jacob and the Poetics of Cubism.

Hello All--Please forward this to likely candidates.  I'm especially
interested in soliciting contributions from women.

Thanks,
Steve

CALL FOR PAPERS (Collection)
George Oppen

 Oppen's book "Of Being Numerous" won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in
1969, and he is considered by many to be one of the major American poets
of the twentieth century, yet his work is still curiously neglected in
academic circles.  With the recent publication of his New Collected Poems
(New Directions, 2002) we have a fitting occasion to reconsider Oppen's
important body of poetry.  This collection of essays is currently slated
to include work by Charles Bernstein, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Forrest
Gander, Michael Heller, Peter Nicholls, Ron Silliman, John Taggart, and
others.  Further contributions are welcome at this time.

Topics might include, but are not limited to, the following:

--Objectivist Movement
--Reception and Influence (including the stages of Oppen's career and his
relation to later poetries:  New Americans, Black Mountain poets, Language
poets, etc.)
--Poetry/Politics/Silence
--Problems of Poetic Form/Serial Poetry/20thC Lyric
--Great Depression/The Thirties
--Marxism/Communist Party/Popular Front
--Jewish-American identity
--World War II
--Vietnam War
--Poetry and Philosophy
--"Of Being Numerous" as a major work of 1960s era poetry
--French Connection (including the Oppens' early travels in France,
George's experience during the war years, and the later strong reception
of George's work by French poets and translators)

Please send 500 word abstracts and c.v. (if available) by March 1, 2003 to
Steve Shoemaker, shoemak@fas.harvard.edu

As far as Stein goes I would start with the portraits, comparing
the so-called analytical cubist portraits with Stein's own portraiture of
around the same time. And then Tender Buttons in relation to collage, not so
much Chair Caning as the works on paper than come a bit later.

BAGHDAD MEMORIES

By

STEPHEN ERIC BRONNER*


We arrived in the middle of the night, smuggled into Iraq via the=20
Jordanian city of Amman, and the cameras were already waiting along=20
with the president of the university, his entourage, some bodyguards, a=20=

few agents of the regime, and the organizers of what would become four=20=

days of activities in Baghdad. Half-asleep, in an empty airport lounge=20=

with postmodern arches, some talked with each other and others with any=20=

reporter willing to talk with them. Roughly forty of us comprised =93US=20=

Academicians Against War,=94 an independent group of intellectuals from=20=

twenty-eight universities and a variety of disciplines. Officially we=20
were on a =93fact-finding=94 mission, but we realized that a week in=20
Baghdad was not very long, and that it would not turn us into experts.=20=

Our purpose, in reality, was different: we wanted a glimpse into the=20
society our government was planning to blast back into the stone-age=20
and a chance to offer our solidarity with the Iraqi people if not the=20
brutal regime of Saddam Hussein.

Holding on to the distinction between the regime and the citizenry,=20
however, called for resisting temptation. =46rom the moment that the=20
motorcade accompanied the bus to our elegant hotel, where we were fed=20
wonderful meals and given more than adequate accommodations, it was=20
clear that we were being seduced. Totalitarian leaders have always=20
liked inviting visitors who might give them legitimacy. Thoughts went=20
through my mind of Aristotle seeking to educate Alexander the Great,=20
Lloyd George and Charles Lindbergh extolling Hitler, and Ernst Bloch=20
and Lion Feuchtwanger pandering to Stalin during the time of the great=20=

terror. Every other corner had a poster of the great leader: Saddam=20
smiling benevolently; Saddam with a derby looking respectable; Saddam=20
reading the Koran; Saddam holding a rifle aloft; Saddam with his arm=20
outstretched in a fascist salute. It was important not to become a=20
dupe: I resolved to keep my wits about me and remember what had=20
originally inspired my visit to Baghdad.

This became easier when we were shown the Iraqi National Museum, saw=20
how pitifully empty it was, and breathed the stink of imperialism:=20
obelisks and artifacts from this cradle of civilization now sit in the=20=

British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the edification=20
of a few dozen connoisseurs and hundreds of bored brats on school=20
tours. The famous Ishtar Gate of Babylon is in Berlin and the steele=20
containing the Code of Hammurabi is in the Louvre: Iraq contents itself=20=

with the facsimiles as its humiliated citizens recall the glories of=20
Mesopotamia and Ur, the city of Abraham, and the great Arab=20
philosophers Avicenna and Averroes, and Ali Baba. Better for Saddam to=20=

have organized a full scale legal war to bring these treasures back=20

adventures that had brought his people to the brink of ruin.

And the majority is on the brink of ruin: most of the roads we saw from=20=

the windows of our bus were unpaved, sewage was spilled on the ground,=20=

jobless men sat on the corners, emaciated animals ran around alleys,=20
and we learned that UNICEF had reported since 1991 a 160% increase in=20
child mortality, arguably the most crucial indicator of public health,=20=

which constituted the greatest regression of the 188 nations surveyed.=20=

We visited a hospital with rotting walls in which children lacked=20
medicine, the new-born lacked incubators, and doctors said that they=20
treated 150 patients a day. Then we were taken to the Al-Ameriya bomb=20
shelter, the site where 400 women and children lost their lives in=20
1991. It was a stark underground casket preserved as a museum in which=20=

one can still see the twisted iron, the remains of bodies plastered=20
against the walls, the blood of the victims on the floor and the=20
ceilings. The United States claims the bombing was unintentional,=20
though it did occur in a residential area, but either way it doesn=92t=20=

matter. This monument remains etched in my mind: it embodies what was=20
the face of war and what these poor people might once again have to=20
endure.

Other countries might be in worse shape. But there is no use employing=20=

what amounts to an algebra of misery: it was obvious that =96 here in=20
Baghdad =96 things were bad enough.
And, speaking ironically, for us too: we were forced to listen while a=20=

kindergarten class sang a hymn in praise of Saddam, a group of=20
down-syndrome children plead for peace, and -- far worse =96 what were=20=

criticism was expressed for the regime and its policies. Anti-Semitism=20=

of the old sort cropped up in any number of conversations over dinner:=20=

even intellectuals made reference to the existence of a Jewish=20
conspiracy and the validity of the infamous Protocols of the Elders of=20=

the mainstream media in the United States has sought to identify Iraq=20
with Saddam Hussein so has the Iraqi media sought to identify =93the=20

The self-defeating character of such censorship and propaganda seemed=20

the need for international organizations to pressure the regime for=20

didn=92t view things that way. We argued. But the priorities came back=20=

>but the cultural features that attend shame, such as violence,
>officiousness, and the like. This occlusion of proper shame suppresses

Cubism definitely influenced the poetry of Yi Sang (1910-37),
arguably the most daring formal experimentalist of modern Korean
literature. The titles and some of the structure of several series of
Yi Sang's poems were based on recursively shifted presentations of
geometric figures or bodies, as in "Architecture's Boundless [or:
Infinite] Hexahedron," published in 1932 ("KOnch'uk  muhan
yungmyOngakch'e"; originally written in Japanese as "Kenchiku mugen
rokumenkakutai"). He was already a painter and architect before he
published poetry and his pen&ink illustrations for friends' literary
works may be sd to utilize cubist principles (see _Muae 1_ [Kaya,
1995], pp. 74-76--the New York edition), combined w other influences
like Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and innovations in Japanese graphic and font
design. In some of his essays, YS is also clearly familiar w the
development of modernist painting from the turn of the century onward.

Fascinating to see how in such poems geometry, algebras, and
post-Newtonian physics become models for grammar and narrative
events. (Since you are likely to have handy vol. 1 of Rothenberg &
Joris' _Poems for the Millennium_, included there are 9 poems by YS,
although none of them are from the several series w explicity
x-sided/-cornered figures/bodies mentioned in their titles.)

Bishops seek saint for Internet

Hopeless clickers urge Vatican to name protector

By Jeordan Legon
  CNN

(CNN) --Fed up with hackers, a flood of spam and lousy connections,=20
Italian Roman Catholics have launched a search for a patron saint of=20
the Internet. And they hope their online poll will yield a holy Web=20
protector by Easter.

Will it be Archangel Gabriel, whom the Bible credits with bringing Mary=20=

the news that she'd give birth to Jesus? Or Saint Isadore of Seville,=20
who wrote the world's first encyclopedia? Or perhaps Saint Clare of=20
Assisi, a nun believed to have seen visions on a wall?

So far, about 5,000 visitors are casting their votes daily on=20
www.santiebeati.it, something that delights Monsignor James P. Moroney,=20=

an expert on prayer and worship for the U.S. Conference of Catholic=20
Bishops.

"Everyone needs patrons in the Kingdom of Heaven, and perhaps the=20
Internet as a very young child needs the interventions of a saint all=20
the more," he said.

Hundreds of years of tradition behind search

Once the votes are collected, the top six choices, along with all of=20
the names of those nominated, will be delivered to the Vatican's=20
Congregation of Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments,=20
the site's creator Francesco Diani said.

The Vatican, however, is keeping mum on whether it will indeed take up=20=

the idea of assigning a saint to the Internet.

But the site is following hundreds of years of tradition during which=20
Catholics have chosen saintly protectors for their towns, churches and=20=

even themselves. Along the way, popes have taken over the process of=20
naming saints and assigning them official patronages. But public=20
opinion has always remained an important influence, which is why the=20
Web poll is so appropriate, said Diani, an Internet expert for Italy's=20=

Conference of Bishops. The bishops have joined with several other=20
Catholic groups to run the Internet saint campaign, Diani said.

"This kind of vote allows us the possibility of collecting a very large=20=

number of preferences," he said. "It's a plebiscite."

Search proves complex

But choosing just the right candidate can be confusing. For one, the=20
site is only in Italian, which is tilting the voting heavily toward=20
saints from that country. And some of those nominated, such as Giacomo=20=

Alberione, the priest who founded a leading Catholic publishing house,=20=

haven't been named saints by the Vatican.

But finding a viable candidate shouldn't be difficult among the=20
thousands of saints =96 at least 465 more, thanks to Pope John Paul II,=20=

who has canonized more people during his quarter century in power than=20=

were named in the 400 years before him.

More saints means more causes get patrons. Three years ago, politicians=20=

got Saint Thomas More, a 16th century judge and English chancellor, as=20=

their patron. And recently the Vatican assigned motorcyclists to Saint=20=

Columbanus, a medieval Irish traveling monk.

"We like to have somebody we might pray to," said Penelope Fletcher,=20
deputy director of the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center in Washington=20=

D.C. "There are people who want to have a saint for everything. ...=20
People come up with a cause and they will assign someone to it."

Saints inspire devotion

The center's interactive saint exhibit, which lists more than 1,500=20
names and biographies, is one of the top tourist draws, Fletcher said.=20=

So it doesn't surprise her people are in search of a patron saint for=20
the Net.

"It's faith and culture coming together," she said.

Besides Assisi, Gabriel and Alberione, others who are leading the=20
voting include: Saint John Bosco, a Italian priest who promoted=20
children's learning in the 1800s; Maximilian Kolbe, a 20th century=20
Polish priest who started a radio station and planned to build a film=20
studio to spread the Gospel; and Saint Alphonsus Liguori, an 18th=20
century prodigious letter writer and author.

Whether the Vatican will heed the results of the Web poll is not clear.=20=

Their press office had no official comment on the matter.

"We know that names have been discussed here and there, but as far as=20
we know there's nothing official going on," a press officer said.

CNN's Christian Cascone and Andrea Facini contributed to this report.

The Whitman title has recently been used by Jed Rasula for a superb =20
book just published by Georgia UP. It is only out on hc but very much =20=

worth the price. Here are the details

This Compost

Ecological Imperatives in American Poetry


Jed Rasula

Discovering an organic tradition in American poetry



Poetry, for Jed Rasula, bears traces of our entanglement with our =20
surroundings, and these traces define a collective voice in modern =20
poetry independent of the more specific influences and backgrounds of =20=

the poets themselves. In This Compost Rasula surveys both the =20
convictions asserted by American poets and the poetics they develop in =20=

their craft, all with an eye toward an emerging ecological worldview.   =20=

        Rasula begins by examining poets associated with Black Mountain =20=

College in the 1950s--Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert =20
Duncan--and their successors. But This Compost extends to include =20
earlier poets like Robinson Jeffers, Ezra Pound, Louis Zukofsky, =20
Kenneth Rexroth, and Muriel Rukeyser, as well as Clayton Eshleman, Gary =20=

Snyder, Michael McClure, and other contemporary poets. Walt Whitman and =20=

Emily Dickinson also make appearances. Rasula draws this diverse group =20=

of poets together, uncovering how the past is a "compost" fertilizing =20=

the present. He looks at the heritage of ancient lore and the legacy of =20=

modern history and colonial violence as factors contributing to =20
ecological imperatives in modern poetry.           This Compost =20
restores the dialogue between poetic language and the geophysical, =20
biological realm of nature that so much postmodern discourse has sought =20=

to silence. It is a fully developed, carefully argued book that deals =20=

with an underrepresented element in modern American culture, where the =20=

natural world and those who write about it have been greatly neglected =20=

in contemporary literary history and theory.



Jed Rasula is Helen S. Lanier Distinguished Professor of English at the =20=

University of Georgia. He is the author of The American Poetry Wax =20
Museum: Reality Effects, 1940-1990 and coauthor of Imagining Language: =20=

SUSTAINABLE HYPERKULTURE:

the conservation of the anarchist spirit-state

If we take as given, the assumption that otherground media is the
element of noise in big brother media's stream of information & that
such noise introduced to a system provokes changes & distortions; &
that the accumulation & collectivization of these cells of noise will
slowly erode the consensus quo. Then, isolated individual information
cells will eventually snowball into a global information avalanche. If
sides are drawn & there is an us-media & a them-media, then each is a
metaphor for the other. If ambiguity is pervasive then the combined
spectacle is theatricalized. Being such inefficient human animals we
can only hold our breath underwater (read underground) for so long. We
cannot expect to seize the media from the deep dark recesses of the
underworld. We must inhabit the media with a polymorphic & long-lived
presence.

In the dreamtime of the hyperculture, there can be no single line of
thought, no immanent thread of action but a simultaneous enlivening of
all networker cells & the suggestion of unlimited possibilities. In a
state of oppression the dream is an escapist relapse but once the
motive for activity has expanded into the unthinkable on its own
accord, in its own time & power, a vision of hyperculture will appear
that doesn't appear so chaotic & fragmented. Instantaneous access to
the growth of information. Cassette, computer, copier, fax, telephone,
radio, cable TV, satellite, tourism, festivals. Already cheap
technology access to the electronic smorgasbord is widely available in
western countries. Just as the corporate information machine can
manufacture influence over us, we can register our opposition by
publishing images, data & sound, by dragging the monolith down &
replacing it with ten thousand different & contradictory realities.

We can begin to understand hyperkulture as a fully integrated
ecological, biological system. As with any system, the chaos, noise &
disintegration are organically inseparable from life & creativity. Only
since the pasteurization of science & art has our understanding of
information & events been dictated by aesthetic taste. This is the
cultural mentality left from the age of imperialism. Divide, conquer &
place the known universe inside a specimen jar. With the advent of info
technology all that has really changed is that social power is a result
of the exploitation of information, where in previous ages it was
people & land that were victimized.

Hyperkulture has a unique status in the mainstream world view. From its
point of view, it regards all forms of marginalized dissent &
experimentation as PURE NOISE. & consequently non-processed information
has no value or use. (Or so they think!) There are those whom argue
that it doesn't matter how radical or "noisy" the media; it will
nonetheless be coopted by the mainstream as mere curiosities &
eccentricities. This may be true in the short term but most of the
undermedia lives on. If fact, because those on the periphery are
perennially ignored, the culture of otherness has unlimited territory
in which to evolve (or mutate) in isolation. Not an isolation of
removal & quarantine but a high-powered isolation in the midst of the
barrage, in the eye of the hurricane.

The ability to accept and understand noise as untapped resource will
enable all hypernauts to install the mechanism which will eventually
replace the genericized 2-dimensional view of information & events. It
is a mistake to target the mainstream for seizure & overthrow when it
has become painfully obvious that the imperialistic mentality which
constructed the prevailing information conglomerate also planted the
seeds for its entropy & eventual destruction. It cannot & will not be
able to contain the natural diversity of the globe.

There are several relevant axioms perpetuated by permaculturalist Bill
Mollison. "The problem is the solution." / "Make the least change for
the greatest possible effect." / "The yield of a system is
theoretically unlimited. The only limit on the number of uses of a
resource possible within a system is in the limit of information and
the imagination of the designer." / "Everything gardens, or has an
effect on its environment." / "Work with nature,...so that we assist
rather than impede natural developments."

According to the Gaian hypothesis the earth is a self-regulating
organism. Can the same be said of information? Does it lead a life of
its own or is it merely a disposable by-product of culture? If we
continue the analogy of agriculture, can the information glut be
composted & recycled? Wait a minute! For centuries artists scientists &
inventors have been reusing the detritus of society for their own
benefit. Further, by maintaining a consciousness of infinite
hypertextual links between all information, the fragmentation &
oppression of our daily lives can be reordered into a meaningful
globally oriented lifestyle.

In the dreamtime of the hyperkulture, milleniums pass without the
continual division of action into specialization & virtualistic
ego-play. In some traditional African cultures there is no separate
word for music, dance & planting. The impulse to fragment the radical
media / information interface by terminology is certain deevolution. To
sustain the info/action/object dialectic, bury your roots deeps into
the global information matrix & ....

I am not sure if somebody in this discussion mentioned them yet, but E.E. Cummings from the mid 1920's and Mina  Loy are coming to mind.   Accidently, both were also painters, lived  for some time in Paris, before (Loy) or during  (e.e.c.) WW1, and were friendly with Gertrude Stein.

Subject: Composer Lou Harrison (1917 - 2003)

Dear Colleagues,

It is with great sadness that I report that composer Lou Harrison died
yesterday evening while traveling to a festival of his music at Ohio
State
University. Official information from Professor Donald Harris who was
coordinating the festival is appended below.

***
(Begin forwarded message)

Last night, while traveling from Chicago to Columbus, Lou Harrison
passed
away.  We had sent Adam Schweigert and Joe Panzner, two students in
Composition and Theory, to Chicago with a University van to greet Lou
and
his traveling companion, Todd Burlingame, and drive them back to campus
for
the Festival.  Lou does not like to fly and took the train, the
California
Zephyr, from near San Francisco to Chicago.  The train arrived at about
5:15 PM.  While en route to Indianapolis, their overnight destination,
Adam, Joe, Lou and Todd decided to stop at a Denny's restaurant in
Lafayette, Indiana, for some dinner.  Lou stumbled and fell upon getting
out of the vehicle and apparently suffered a heart attack.  He had great
difficulty breathing.  Paramedics were called and they arrived within
minutes. Lou was transported to the hospital but was unable to be
revived.
He passed away around 9 or 9:30 PM.     We are  awaiting the coroner's
report for final confirmation of the cause of death.

This is a great tragedy for the entire world of music.  Lou was as
excited
about the Festival as we were.  Our sympathies go out to all in the
world
of music and dance who treasured his great gift.   I will always
remember
the joy in his voice when we spoke over the telephone about the
Festival.
He was an active participant in planning the concerts.  He had also
prepared a special seminar for OSU students in composition.  He was very
much looking forward to the CSO performances of his Third Symphony in a
final revision that he had just completed.  He told me how honored he
felt
to have so many of his compositions performed on the Festival.  Let
everyone know that the Festival will go on as planned as a tribute to
this
legendary American musician.


Lou Harrison will be cremated today; his remains shipped back to
California.   He was eighty-five years old.

"Ezra Pound ('The Idaho Dude') charged artists 'to debunk by lucidity!'  Lou
Harrison is not only lucid and clear; he is also luminous, he emits
self-generated light."

with air & light & stars upon

A great loss. The list of works at the second site is by no means

Does anybody know what happened to the editing he'd been doing for many

I'm very sorry to hear about Lou's death. He was a great guy as well
as a composer, with an amazing array of interests that ranged well
beyond work that was similar to his own.

There are four editions of Ives' Universe Symphony in progress that I
know of, none of which are really complete in any useful way. Besides
Harrison's, there's one by Larry Austin (the only one that's been
even partially recorded, as far as I know); David Porter (who did the
reconstruction of Ives' Emerson Piano Concerto that's been performed
a few times) & Johnny Reinhardt (who runs the American Microtonal
Music festival in NYC). I don't think Harrison's has been performed,
though I know the other three have.

Bests,

Herb

We were pleased to learn very recently that three poems from the premiere

There was a good deal of discussion here about what is the significance of
the Best American Poetry series.  Opinions vary widely, but we think that, by
one measure, our inclusion is a sign of something good for the journal.

It is sad to hear of Lou Harrison's death. I was lucky
enough to meet him once, at a very intimate discussion and
performance of Henry Cowell's music that was part of an
arts festival in my hometown of Halcyon, CA. He played
"pedal boy" to the pianist from Mills College, forget
his name, who was performing Cowell's haunting "Banshee" on
the strings -- just as he had for Cowell, Lou said. He was
a wise, funny, and gentle human being as well as a great
composer.

There's also the classic by Bram Dijkstra: Cubism,=20

I agree with Wystan that Stein's portraits (of Picasso,=20

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I don't want to embarrass anyone, but I think that on Alan's 60th birthday,
it is appropriate, for once, to say a short thing about how I think of Alan
Sondheim, what I think of him and his work, just briefly. Because he has
completely altered how I think about the word.

I had the great pleasure of meeting Alan Sondheim 5 or 6 weeks ago. It's an
all too rare deal to meet a writer and or an artist who has totally altered
the world of words, but I got to meet him, and it was just great to see His
Flesh, the flesh of Alan Sondheim, you know, in that sycophantic worshipy
way that some of us get when we see the real deal. My sense of how things
are goes something like this: he is, I feel, a writer of Dantesque and
Miltonic proportions. I've used the "G" word to describe him.

That's how it is for me, anyway. And I wish him, you Alan, a stupendous
day. Enjoy it. I'm very happy you're here in this world. It is better--all
of it--because of you.

These artists were alive with and around one another at the same moment.  I'm

how funny--as soon as this discussion about cubism and
literature started I thought of Reverdy as a perfect
example of what I imagined cubism to be: "an
abandonment of space as a principle of ordering" (from
_Malevich_ by Simmen/Kohloff) and in poetry at least a
privileging of fractured viewpoints but of a unified
subject--

CD Wright's book "Deepstep Come Shining" typifies this
for me: a narrative event quite cohesive in linear
space and time, but then pulled apart and stacked
together *re-presented* sort of...

Brandon:

Based on your close reading of the text, I will go back and read it.
And, yes, I will grant you the Isaiah was  -- in the moment -- somewhat
effective, since it at least gave us the (passing) impression that it was
inserted by the man's own fervent pitch (He, I have learned, spends  long
stretches of time reading the Bible). I will just say that my eyes did
a bit of a roll, thinking a more secular statement might have served
the moment more equitably. (This was a point brought up by some
friends of mine who are practicing Hindu.)

Perhaps I over-reacted, still inflamed, as I am over his earlier courtship
with anti- Catholic/ Jew and-who-knows-who-else Bob Jones "University",
as well as all the Christian Vs. Muslim rhetoric leading up to what seems
to be a count down.

A helpful discussion compares the cubism of Leopold Survage and visual =
poems of Guillaime Apollinaire. See: Appolinaire, Visual Poetry, and Art =
Criticism (Willard Bohn; Associated University Presses; 1993). Bohn =
boils down the point of inquiry to "...what struck Apollinaire in the =
course of his discussions with the artist was how closely the latter's =
efforts resembled his own. Whereas Survage strove to integrate =
linguistic mechanisms into the realm of painting, Apollinaire was was =
trying to accommodate pictorial structures to the demands of poetry. By =
grafting the sign system of one genre onto the other, each in his own =
way was experimenting with "plastic metaphor." JL

On perhaps some of the most important nights of our new century, Jim
Behrle's 20s will end and his 30s will begin.  Countdown to the end of his
hideously wasted youth by listening to his poems and (in some cases) the
poems of others younger, cuter and much more talented:


FRI 2/7 7 PM Wordsworth Books
with Peach Friedman
30 Brattle St.
Cambridge, MA 02138
(617) 354 5201 (ask for "Jim")


SUN 2/9 6:37 PM Zinc Bar
with Sarah Manguso
90 West Houston Street
(corner of La Guardia Place)
(212) 477 8337


SAT 2/15 3:30 lecture 5:00 reading
lecture: "Jim Behrle Forgets his Heroes,"
~or~ "Fuck Your Heroes and Drop Out of School"
(plus bonus track: "Larry Fagin is *still* a Jerk").

(Note: Like the Sex Pistols, Jim Behrle may break up after an SF appearance.
  You will be able to tell your grandchildren you were there that night.
Think about it.)

~Please attend if you're into attending.~

Jim Behrle is known for his elaborate and hilarious personal bios. He is the
author of 837 chapbooks. He is the editor of can we have our ball back? and
the poetry editor of PINDELDYBOZ. This is more than he wants you to know
about him. He also is featured on the syndicated radio newsmagazine "Here &
Now." His 30th birthday is 2/8/03, and he's just started therapy. He doesn't
live in Brooklyn, *thanks* for bringing it up.  This bio was over-hyped and
kind of a let-down.


If you would like the Jim Behrle Version 30.0 U.S. Command Tour 2003 to come
through your city or town please backchannel.

A few days ago, scanning the German daily press, I came across an
article in the _Frankfurter Rundschau_ by an American university
professor, relating his trip to Iraq in January in the company of some
thirty other US academics. I thought the piece useful & informative &
tried to locate the original publication in English -- nowhere to be

told me that it had not been published in the English-speaking world

BAGHDAD MEMORIES

By

STEPHEN ERIC BRONNER*


We arrived in the middle of the night, smuggled into Iraq via the
Jordanian city of Amman, and the cameras were already waiting along
with the president of the university, his entourage, some bodyguards, a
few agents of the regime, and the organizers of what would become four
days of activities in Baghdad. Half-asleep, in an empty airport lounge
with postmodern arches, some talked with each other and others with any
reporter willing to talk with them. Roughly forty of us comprised “US
Academicians Against War,” an independent group of intellectuals from
twenty-eight universities and a variety of disciplines. Officially we
were on a “fact-finding” mission, but we realized that a week in
Baghdad was not very long, and that it would not turn us into experts.
Our purpose, in reality, was different: we wanted a glimpse into the
society our government was planning to blast back into the stone-age
and a chance to offer our solidarity with the Iraqi people if not the
brutal regime of Saddam Hussein.

Holding on to the distinction between the regime and the citizenry,
however, called for resisting temptation. From the moment that the
motorcade accompanied the bus to our elegant hotel, where we were fed
wonderful meals and given more than adequate accommodations, it was
clear that we were being seduced. Totalitarian leaders have always
liked inviting visitors who might give them legitimacy. Thoughts went
through my mind of Aristotle seeking to educate Alexander the Great,
Lloyd George and Charles Lindbergh extolling Hitler, and Ernst Bloch
and Lion Feuchtwanger pandering to Stalin during the time of the great
terror. Every other corner had a poster of the great leader: Saddam
smiling benevolently; Saddam with a derby looking respectable; Saddam
reading the Koran; Saddam holding a rifle aloft; Saddam with his arm
outstretched in a fascist salute. It was important not to become a
dupe: I resolved to keep my wits about me and remember what had
originally inspired my visit to Baghdad.

This became easier when we were shown the Iraqi National Museum, saw
how pitifully empty it was, and breathed the stink of imperialism:
obelisks and artifacts from this cradle of civilization now sit in the
British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the edification
of a few dozen connoisseurs and hundreds of bored brats on school
tours. The famous Ishtar Gate of Babylon is in Berlin and the steele
containing the Code of Hammurabi is in the Louvre: Iraq contents itself
with the facsimiles as its humiliated citizens recall the glories of
Mesopotamia and Ur, the city of Abraham, and the great Arab
philosophers Avicenna and Averroes, and Ali Baba. Better for Saddam to
have organized a full scale legal war to bring these treasures back
home – or at least be compensated for them – than the military
adventures that had brought his people to the brink of ruin.

And the majority is on the brink of ruin: most of the roads we saw from
the windows of our bus were unpaved, sewage was spilled on the ground,
jobless men sat on the corners, emaciated animals ran around alleys,
and we learned that UNICEF had reported since 1991 a 160% increase in
child mortality, arguably the most crucial indicator of public health,
which constituted the greatest regression of the 188 nations surveyed.
We visited a hospital with rotting walls in which children lacked
medicine, the new-born lacked incubators, and doctors said that they
treated 150 patients a day. Then we were taken to the Al-Ameriya bomb
shelter, the site where 400 women and children lost their lives in
1991. It was a stark underground casket preserved as a museum in which
one can still see the twisted iron, the remains of bodies plastered
against the walls, the blood of the victims on the floor and the
ceilings. The United States claims the bombing was unintentional,
though it did occur in a residential area, but either way it doesn’t
matter. This monument remains etched in my mind: it embodies what was
the face of war and what these poor people might once again have to
endure.

Other countries might be in worse shape. But there is no use employing
what amounts to an algebra of misery: it was obvious that – here in
Baghdad – things were bad enough.
And, speaking ironically, for us too: we were forced to listen while a
kindergarten class sang a hymn in praise of Saddam, a group of
down-syndrome children plead for peace, and -- far worse – what were
clearly party hacks giving a set of academic papers in which it became
abundantly clear how totalitarianism dulls the capacity to engage in
meaningful discourse and casts a shadow over public life. No hint of
criticism was expressed for the regime and its policies. Anti-Semitism
of the old sort cropped up in any number of conversations over dinner:
even intellectuals made reference to the existence of a Jewish
conspiracy and the validity of the infamous Protocols of the Elders of
Zion. Few knew about the Israeli opposition and “Peace Now.” Just as
the mainstream media in the United States has sought to identify Iraq
with Saddam Hussein so has the Iraqi media sought to identify “the
Jews” with Ariel Sharon.

The self-defeating character of such censorship and propaganda seemed
obvious. Friends we met, in private, admitted as much and insisted upon
the need for international organizations to pressure the regime for
democratic reform. They noted that five years ago the mosques were
empty and that, now, they are packed. But certain members of our group
-- brave people inspired by a Christian belief in charity and good
works – encountered different people with different views, felt it was
not our place to judge the Iraqi state, and believed that criticism
would only undermine the antiwar effort. Others, including myself,
didn’t view things that way. We argued. But the priorities came back
into focus when we were greeted by ordinary Iraqis grateful for our
visit and terrified by the thought of another war. It became ever more
apparent that every person with whom we spoke – the television reporter
who had lost her niece, the law professor who had lost her aunt and
cousin, the handsome taxi driver who had lost some fingers, and the
veterinarian who had lost his house – might be dead in a matter of
weeks.

A vote was taken against presenting a “joint resolution” with our Iraqi
hosts. Our own statement, in my opinion, should have been more critical
of Saddam’s regime for its role in exploitation of the misery caused by
the sanctions; its corruption; its foolhardy militarism, and its
assault on human rights. But, ultimately, we were in Baghdad to foster
opposition to a looming war with all its regional implications and
secondary effects, insist upon ending sanctions on non-military goods,
and improve relations between the United States and Iraq. And, on the
long plane-ride home, I realized that we had done what we could.
Perhaps we were naïve. But then it also occurred to me that, should
this war be averted, it will have been because naïve people around the
world had pressured their governments in the name of peace rather than
war and proved willing – in the famous phrase – “to speak truth to
power.”

Bravo, indeed... from Greil Marcus' real-life top ten:

10) Helen Thomas at White House press briefing, Jan. 6

In his 1972 study "The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the
English Revolution," Christopher Hill, poring through the annals of the 16th
and 17th centuries, tried to reconstruct the beginnings of a heresy that by
the 1650s was making itself known across England. There would be a document
noting that a certain craftsperson had questioned the divinity of Jesus; 20
years later there would be a record of a woman denying the need to work.
Across a page or so, a dozen examples of seemingly stray people claiming
that all true spirits were god and that all authority was false took on a
huge charge, less from the power of any given fragment than from one's sense
of how much was missing between the fragments. Reading the transcript of the
exchange between 82-year-old Hearst News Services columnist Helen Thomas and
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, what was so shocking was not what she
said, but, given the socialization produced by the news writing and even
editorial writing in the likes of the New York Times, how bizarre it
seemed -- because in the context of contemporary political discourse Thomas
spoke not as a reporter but precisely as a heretic:

Thomas: At the earlier briefing, Ari, you said that the president deplored
the taking of innocent lives. Does that apply to all innocent lives in the
world? And I have a follow-up.

Fleischer: I refer specifically to a horrible terrorist attack on Tel Aviv
that killed scores and wounded hundreds. And the president, as he said in
his statement yesterday, deplores in the strongest terms the taking of those
lives and the wounding of those people, innocents in Israel.

T: My follow-up is, why does he want to drop bombs on innocent Iraqis?

F: Helen, the question is how to protect Americans, and our allies and
friends --

Thomas and Fleischer went back and forth in several more exchanges. The
president is only interested in defense against Iraq, Fleischer reiterated.

T: And he thinks they are a threat to us?

F: There is no question that the president thinks that Iraq is a threat to
the United States.

T: The Iraqi people?

F: The Iraqi people are represented by their government. If there was regime
change, the Iraqi --

T: So they will be vulnerable?

F: Actually, the president has made it very clear that he has no dispute
with the people of Iraq. That's why the American policy remains a policy of
regime change. There is no question the people of Iraq --

T: That's a decision for them to make, isn't it? It's their country.

F: Helen, if you think the people of Iraq are in a position to dictate who
their dictator is, I don't think that has been what history has shown.

T: I think many countries' people don't have the decision -- including us.

Thanks to Chris Walters.

BAGHDAD MEMORIES

By

STEPHEN ERIC BRONNER*


We arrived in the middle of the night, smuggled into Iraq via the
Jordanian city of Amman, and the cameras were already waiting along
with the president of the university, his entourage, some bodyguards, a
few agents of the regime, and the organizers of what would become four
days of activities in Baghdad. Half-asleep, in an empty airport lounge
with postmodern arches, some talked with each other and others with any
reporter willing to talk with them. Roughly forty of us comprised “US
Academicians Against War,” an independent group of intellectuals from
twenty-eight universities and a variety of disciplines. Officially we
were on a “fact-finding” mission, but we realized that a week in
Baghdad was not very long, and that it would not turn us into experts.
Our purpose, in reality, was different: we wanted a glimpse into the
society our government was planning to blast back into the stone-age
and a chance to offer our solidarity with the Iraqi people if not the
brutal regime of Saddam Hussein.

Holding on to the distinction between the regime and the citizenry,
however, called for resisting temptation. From the moment that the
motorcade accompanied the bus to our elegant hotel, where we were fed
wonderful meals and given more than adequate accommodations, it was
clear that we were being seduced. Totalitarian leaders have always
liked inviting visitors who might give them legitimacy. Thoughts went
through my mind of Aristotle seeking to educate Alexander the Great,
Lloyd George and Charles Lindbergh extolling Hitler, and Ernst Bloch
and Lion Feuchtwanger pandering to Stalin during the time of the great
terror. Every other corner had a poster of the great leader: Saddam
smiling benevolently; Saddam with a derby looking respectable; Saddam
reading the Koran; Saddam holding a rifle aloft; Saddam with his arm

have organized a full scale legal war to bring these treasures back
home – or at least be compensated for them – than the military
adventures that had brought his people to the brink of ruin.

And the majority is on the brink of ruin: most of the roads we saw from

visit and terrified by the thought of another war. It became ever more
apparent that every person with whom we spoke – the television reporter
who had lost her niece, the law professor who had lost her aunt and
cousin, the handsome taxi driver who had lost some fingers, and the
veterinarian who had lost his house – might be dead in a matter of
weeks.

A vote was taken against presenting a “joint resolution” with our Iraqi
hosts. Our own statement, in my opinion, should have been more critical
of Saddam’s regime for its role in exploitation of the misery caused by
the sanctions; its corruption; its foolhardy militarism, and its
assault on human rights. But, ultimately, we were in Baghdad to foster
opposition to a looming war with all its regional implications and
secondary effects, insist upon ending sanctions on non-military goods,
and improve relations between the United States and Iraq. And, on the
long plane-ride home, I realized that we had done what we could.
Perhaps we were naïve. But then it also occurred to me that, should
this war be averted, it will have been because naïve people around the
world had pressured their governments in the name of peace rather than
war and proved willing – in the famous phrase – “to speak truth to
power.”

 I don't know if anyone mentioned it,
but what about Kenneth Rexroth ?
Also there's an book entirely devoted
to the subject:
'Part Of The Climate' - American Cubist Poetry
by Jacqueline Vaught Brogan,
published by Univ. of California Press, 1991.
It's a nice thorough tome on the subject.

Subject:      Poetry is news, or is it?

In relation to the fine political posts today, I remember that the Poetry is
News event at St. Marks last Saturday received a lot of publicity and
speculation, and I wonder if someone who was there might give us a report
about what happened, and what their sense of the various presentations was.

My first thought was that media coverage of the shuttle disaster might have
dampened attendance, but apparently there was a large turnout. I've heard
from one of the organizers back-channel, who was quite elated; he also
mentioned that it was interesting to see who didn't attend.

Which is to say that I think Laura Bush's ideas about the separation of
poetry and politics are actually quite widespread, perhaps even on this
list.

With the flurry of news about "political poems" this last week -- the Hamill
project, the Swift project, the Poetry is News presentation -- one could be
forgiven for forgetting that the very concept was called into question not
too many months ago.
That thread in early December raised lots of interesting questions about
audience, technique, and efficacy of political poems, in response to which
I've been writing a piece called "Theses Toward the Political Poem" -- (if I
had a blog like everyone else I'd publish it there, but it'll just have to
wait for more traditional means).

(An aside: where DO those bloggers get all that time?) (Another aside: I
still prefer lists, with at least the possibility of asynchronous call and
response.)

From the Poetry is News event publicity:

"it becomes increasingly embarrassing and painful to attend events that
don't even 'reference'
the current reality. The false dichotomies between politics and aesthetics
can only be put to
rest when history is made present and resistance enacted."

I agree absolutely that the dichotomy between politics and poetics is a
false one, but others might not; it's a discussion that I never seem to get
enough of.
____________________________________

One more thought about the President's speech on Saturday: as I told Brandon
back-channel, what I objected to was religion's classic *displacement* of
grief onto another sphere ("all safely home"), which Christianity, of
course, specializes in. I can envision a speech that might not have been so
eager to "move on"; there are some things that don't achieve -- that noxious
word -- "closure."

What exactly makes a poem a cubist poem? Is cubism basically an idea, a
philosophy with a specific plastic application in modernism or sui generis to
painting and sculpture which poetry tries to emulate? This is a significant
distinction because works outside plastic arts considered cubist (or cubist
influenced) are so for different reasons.

For instance, Reverdy's cubism, at least to me, is related to his visual,
tonal jump cuts in his poems. Stein says that from an airplane the American
landscape looks like a cubist painting, associating cubism with modern
technology. (We had the discussion about the relation between avant garde art
and militarism a few months ago.) From what I understand, Lew relates Yi
Sang's cubism to mathematics -therefore, I think, to its mystical potential.
In my essay "The Peripheral Space of Photography" (Green Integer, just came
out), in the discussion of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's photograph, "Decorating
Work," the minimalist, Corbusier/Cubist surface of this photograph gets
transformed into a meditation on the passage of time -once again, suggesting
a tension between avant garde rationality and mysticism in the idea of
cubisim.

When Kevin Killian asked his very interesting question, my first impulse was
to e-mail him that the cubist poem does not exist, though aware that some
poets are called cubists (I refrained myself). I think that is the real
weight of Kevin's question "does anyone know a cubist poet or poem?" I
phantasized that Kevin bet that a cubist poem is imaginary, as in "imaginary
numbers." It seems to me cubism is a very fluid (plastic) concept of which
cubism in the arts is a local expression; it harbors a fertile contradiction.
While on the surface it projects a machine (also modernism, etc.), the idea
of multiple vision implies an unreachable center, core, reality. Isn't the
robot a mystical creature in literature, the alchemist the original scientist?

Please circulate:

This is an exploratory message to see how many Philadelphia area poets
would be interested in taking part in an anti-war poetry event on
February
12th, the day the poetry symposium hosted by Laura Bush at the White
House was supposed to have taken place. The event was cancelled after the
White House got wind of a brewing protest spearheaded by Sam Hamill.

Please write to Claire McGuire (mcguire@scils.rutgers.edu) or Kitty

Hi Joe,

You quoted from the publicity for Poetry is News event: "it becomes
increasingly embarrassing and painful to attend events that don't even
'reference' the current reality. The false dichotomies between politics and
aesthetics can only be put to rest when history is made present and
resistance enacted."

While I understand the concern shown in the above quote, I'm lost as to what
events Ammiel Alcalay and Anne Waldman, the Poetry is News organizers, might
be referring to in their publicity. Having scheduled readings at the Segue
Series at Bowery Poetry Club with Brian Stefans last year, and having gone
to several readings there in the following months (curated by Laura Elrick
and Michael Scharf), as well as a number of events at BPC and elsewhere over
the last several months, I would say that there is very little happening in
New York that I've personally seen that has not referenced--or indeed
foregrounded--"the current reality." And not just in public readings and
performances, but in magazines (see for instance the latest issue of the
Poetry Project Newsletter), and on blogs: Brian, Jordan, Nada, Drew, and
I--to mention only the bloggers I personally know living in New York--have
all not only made repeated references to "the current reality," but have
devoted numerous entries specifically to it.

It's worth noting that neither Anne nor Ammiel were present at any of the
readings I've been to in the last several months--save for the Marathon,
where Anne performed. No big deal, but it might explain the disconnect
between their publicity's characterization of public poetry in the city and
what has been my own experience of the reality of it.

You also noted, Joe, that "one of the organizers back-channel mentioned that
it was interesting to see who didn't attend. Which is to say that I think
Laura Bush's ideas about the separation of poetry and politics are actually
quite widespread, perhaps even on this list."

That's quite a leap to make: X misses one event, therefore X is *for* the
separation of politics and aesthetics. More than eight million people living
in New York did not show up to the Poetry is News event. That's an awful lot
of red "A"s to sew on people's clothing.

So, yes, let's have a report on the event, especially for those who weren't
able to attend. Ammiel and Anne deserve a lot credit for putting that whole
thing together, not to mention all of the other genuinely valuable things
they do contribute as writers and activists. It will be interesting to see
what will come out of it.

But, Joe, I don't believe I've ever seen you at an event here, so I don't
understand why you find it so easy to take at face value their
characterization--a condemnation, unless I'm misreading it--of public arts
activity NY in the last year or so. And to then take that a step further and
basically condemn the aesthetics of anyone who didn't make their event. I
might be wrong in believing this, but my sense is, if Ammiel and Anne had
come to more readings and events last year--at least what I was going
to--the line you quoted from their publicity probably wouldn't have made the
first cut.

Thanks,

Gary

i don't think stein's association was with "modern technology" so much as
with geometric shape.  this is what impressed her.

stein was making reference to geometric shape, except to say that "modern
technology" has made it possible for man to see the earth in a new way, from
above, for its geometric pattern ("the cubist paradigm," if you will).

but stein was not a cubist, and neither was jacob, and neither was wcw, and
all for one crucial reason.  neither made the analogy between geometric
structure and grammatical structure.  (and neither does kamber in his "max
jacob and the poetics of cubism," which is why his thesis is ultimately
unsatisfying, for all he writes about the transposition from one medium to
the other and the substitution of verbal coherence for painted surface.  and
neither does dijkstra, in his "cubism, stieglitz, and the early poetry of
wcw," where for all his talk about "time," and "simultaneism," he really
means "stereometric vision," which was coined by ortega y gasset and is
elucidated in "the dehumanization of art.")

"stereometric vision" seems to be the most explicative and clarifying
terminology for the most common interpretation of cubism (painting).  but in
my opinion, for the transposition of elements to be successful, the poet
must first comprehend the analogy between geometric structure and
grammatical structure.

the question then becomes, not "what will a cubist poem look like," but "how
will a cubist poem read"?  (however, this is not to suggest that a concrete
poem cannot be a cubist poem, both semantically and eidetically.)  for an
example of a cubist poem, i would humbly direct the reader to my poem, "the
galloping man," which can be found at:

http://canwehaveourballback.com/11thomasino.htm


although neither make the analogy with grammatical structure, the books to
read first, definitely, are: kamber, dijkstra, and ortega y gasset's chapter
on cubism.

thought provoking, Murat.  I've been musing on his query and the responses
here.  If this were unpacked surrealistically we would have Yi Sang as poet
and artist accepting the mantle of 'cubist' bestowed by the West and
allowing his work to be classified as 'cubist poetry' when clearly he would
have been aware of someone like Bada Shanren and his unique visual/verbal
perception of what we have come to "see" as reality?

To touch on some recent threads here, I wonder what kinds of re-shufflings
we might find if we reshuffle the cards and go through them from the
Columbia's perspective, for example, or politically speaking to quote
Creeley quoting Scott. "Breathes there a man....."

 I came in on this string a bit late; Kevin's original question, now I
have it, is I think harder to answer than most of the responses would =
seem
to suggest. Cubism belongs to a history of the fragment-text, arguably =
THE
modernist form, in poetry anyway--so the instances of coincidence are
necessarily many and varied. But influence is another matter (and less
interesting, depending on why you're asking the question)and I suspect =
there
little evidence cubism influencing poetry.
More people have been impressed by the importance of cubism than have
understood what Picasso and Brague were doing. And that was the case =
more or
less from the moment they started doing it. And that's another history;
pretty interesting because mis-reading, intentionally as well as
unintentionally can be productive. Which gives us two cubisms, at =
least. I
wouldn't call Dijkstra's book a classic, I remember it as plodding and
uninsightful. Wendy Steiner has a no nonsense chapter in The Colours of
Rhetoric 'A Cubist Historiography'; and a well-argued book on Stein's
portraiture: Exact Resemblance to Exact Resemblance which defines the =
terms
of the analogy in that case.=20

/ubu Editons :: Winter 2003 Titles
--------------------------------------


Kevin Davies  _ Pause Button _


Davies writing takes the social critique of the Language Poets and the crushing ear of
the best Projective versifiers and sets it all in cyclotronic motion with his rapier's
wit and caffeinated melancholy, making him the Zorro of poets associated with Vancouver's
Kootenay School of Writing and the anthemist of choice for a disowned intelligentsia.
Davies, who now lives in New York, published his second book, _Comp._, in 2000 to much
acclaim, but the quasi-legendary _Pause Button_, first published in 1992 by Vancouver's
Tsunami Editions, has long been unavailable to those not in the vicinity of Canada's
choice used bookstores.


Deanna Ferguson _The Relative Minor_

Ferguson's first book of poems is at once frenetically impatient with anything that could
be called a lyrical subjectivity yet speaks, through the sliced rubrics of its many
"postmodern" poses, from a perspective singularly angry, disaffected, vulnerable,
eloquent, political and brash. The Relative Minor takes the project of the Language poets
to the next level of public address, the scale tipping from (though not forgetting) the
lexicons of theory and falling toward the pure, dystopic clamor of punk aspiration.
Ferguson, who lives and works in Vancouver, has not published a book since this 1993
volume, one of the major contributions by the poets associated with the Kootenay School
of Writing.


Richard Foreman _Now That Communism is Dead My Life Feels Empty!_

For years, Foreman has been staging his plays at St. Mark's Ontological Theater with the
regularity of the great Avant-Pop-in-the-Sky's postmodernist pacemaker, tooling his
"reverberation machines" into a pristine state of subversive whimsy. Though the reader of
this text will miss the virtuoso performances of Tony Torn and Jay Smith as bathetic
superheroes dueling over the fallen Iron Curtain in the play's New York run, the
paranoiac frenzy and epistemological funboxes of Foreman's high style are alive and
flinching in _Now That Communism is Dead_.


Madeline Gins _What the President Will Say and Do!!_

Madeline Gins has mostly been known for her collaborative works with the
architect/philosopher Arakawa, releasing _Mechanism of Meaning_, an illustrated series of
playful epistemological vignettes, in 1979, and devoting most of the last two decades
exploring Reversible Destiny, a radical philosophy of architecture in which one "refuses
to die." _What the President_ is Gins in a more light-hearted, accessible vein, her
creative assaults on mundane thinking arousing both laughter and caustic impatience with
the status quo. Rarely has a book appeared as prescient and poignant twenty years after
its initial publication.


Jessica Grim _Vexed_

Grim's style masterly evokes the simplicities of poetry in the "New American" vein, with
its fragments of candid observation just shimmering on the surface of the poem, but she
allies it with a "post-Language" sensibility that balks before the prospect of a
too-fluid Romanticism, thus spicing sensual reverie with documentary relevance. The
musicality of Grim's poems is understated, the words delicately gathered, such that the
poems occasionally seem given over to indeterminacy and chance, but in fact each one has
a formal perfection that illustrates an underlying lyrical integrity.


Peter Manson _Adjunct: An Undigest_

Adjunct _forms a teetering, overloaded bridge between practitioners of
subjectively-deodorized "conceptual literature" such as Kenneth Goldsmith and Craig
Dworkin and writers working in a "new sentence" vein such as Language poets Bruce Andrews
and Lyn Hejinian, all with a nod to novelist David Markson's _Reader's Block_. But
_Adjunct _is far from an organized literary venture; rather, it is a sprawling,
subconsciously assembled stockpile of casual phrases, trivial ideas, worthless
statistics, obituary notices, self-reflexive misgivings, and numberless, numbing et
ceteras that make it an electric anthem to cultural (and personal) entropy.


Michael Scharf _Verite_

Scharf's poems are at once vulnerable to, and defiant of, the impositions of civic
society, as the strands of global and historical implication wafting through the air that
strike most of us as attenuated notes of "otherness" are transformed, for this poet, into
the throbbing heart of community. The roving eye of _Verite_ takes in quantities of data
that would sink writers with a less fluid and agile lyric touch, and the mixture of
journalism, sonnets, "lieder" and manifesto-like prose poetry make this a compelling,
multi-faceted collection, the second by this New York author.


Ron Sillman _2197_

Silliman is known for several seminal long poems such as _Tjanting _and _Ketjak_, and he
has been involved in writing the long "new sentence" (he coined the phrase) poem _The
Alphabet_ for over twenty years. _The Age of Huts_, published by Roof Books in 1986, has
had a quieter reputation, despite its relatively concise display of Silliman's wide
formal experimentation and mastery. "2197" is the second half of the book, and
anticipates, with its stock of phrases morphing and reappearing in different acrobatic
poses throughout its pages, the preoccupation with dataflows, rhizomes and digital
recurrence that has characterized much literature in the age of the internet.


Ron Sillman _Sunset Debris_

Silliman is known for several seminal long poems such as _Tjanting _and _Ketjak_, and he
has been involved in writing the long "new sentence" (he coined the phrase) poem _The
Alphabet_ for over twenty years. _The Age of Huts_, published by Roof Books in 1986, has
had a quieter reputation, despite its relatively concise display of Silliman's wide
formal experimentation and mastery. "Sunset Debris" is, structurally, a collection of
questions, but the cumulative affect of the queries is both giddily intoxicating and,
subterraneously, melancholic, as the voice of personal entreaty become subsumed under the
ceaseless rhythms of its literary method and, by extension, time and memory.


Juliana Spahr _Response_

Spahr's deceptively simple language conveys a serious and complex assessment of civic
duty and the potential for political agency in a time when selfhood -- one's sense of
uniqueness and of the _permanence _of one's personality -- has been severely compromised.
Under fire by a mass media that trivializes all values for the sake of ratings and
shunned by the opaque workings of a State that ignores, for the sake of control, the eye
of the radical democrat, the individual is, in Spahr's poetry, revived to take center
stage, floodlit by possiblity. _Response_, Spahr's first book (_Fuck You-Aloha-I Love
You_ appeared in 2001), was the winner of the National Poetry Series in 1996, and demands
of the reader a new sense of participation in the social world.


Hannah Weiner _Little Books / Indians_

Weiner, who died in 1997, culled from what she considered a psychic ability -- she
literally saw words on the foreheads of her many New York friends and transcribed them
like extrasensory conversations -- to create her typographically distinctive books of
poetry. But there is nothing na&iuml;ve about what Weiner was doing: she was a
self-conscious, sophisticated artist, a close friend of the great innovator Carolee
Schneemann, and has long been considered a central figure in Language poetry. Weiner's
oeuvre reflects a complex, totalizing investment in the properties of words as they
permeate and conflict with the self and the imagined "other," and _Little Books/Indians_,
long out of print, is both a visual treat and an engaging read.


Mac Wellman _The Lesser Magoo_

The final of the four plays of Wellman's Crowtet, Magoo follows the adventures of Curran
and Candle -- an expert on "Crowe's Dark Space" -- and their motley assemblage of peers,
some of them categorically "unusualist," in the parallel, decidedly unsettled, universe
that is distinctly Wellman's. Magoo is chockfull of alternative histories, comprehensive
pseudo-sciences, eerily relevant, off-the-map absurdist politics and soft-spoken contacts
between humans all vying for attention in the seemingly self-propelled linguistics of
Wellman's versification, which at turns recalls Beckett, at others the polymath Pynchon
or the more childlike landscapes of Ashbery (in Girls on the Run). The music for The
Lesser Magoo, scored for voices, toy piano, ukulele, and violin, was composed by Michael
Roth, for both the Los Angeles and the New York productions.


Darren Wershler-Henry _ The Tapeworm Foundry _

Toronto-based Wershler-Henry's last book of poems, _Nicholodeon_, was a seemingly
exhaustive survey of the possibilities of concrete and process-based poetry in the
Nineties, organized like a paper database with icons to guide the wary reader toward
conceptual handles. _The Tapeworm Foundry_ is, in some ways, the opposite: a single
unpunctuated sentence of pro-Situ proposals that resembles a social virus more than a
functioning data-organism, its litany of avant-garde projects linked only by the
seemingly innocuous, but progressively more imperative-sounding, "andor."

curtains for Art!=20

___
NEW YORK.- The "Guernica" work by Pablo Picasso at the entrance of the
Security Council of the United Nations has been covered with a curtain. The
reason for covering this work is that this is the place where diplomats mak=
e
statements to the press and have this work as the background. The Picasso
work features the horrors of war. On January 27 a large blue curtain=A0 was
placed to cover the work.

A diplomat stated that it would not be an appropriate background if the
ambassador of the United Statesat the U.N. John Negroponte, or Powell, talk
about war surrounded with women, children and animals shouting with horror
and showing the suffering of the bombings.

This work is a reproduction of the Guernica that was donated by Nelson A.
Rockefeller to the U.N. in 1985.
___

I wonder - given the a new opportunity - what image Negroponte and Powell
would prefer. (?)

I is making love right after her

I fucking hate poems, maybe I
always have.

I'm missing out on all the sex.

That's what I'm thinking in the
darkened audience amid other distracted
listeners.  I could be making love
right now.  That's all people in
poems ever fucking do.

There are only a few poets I'd like
to make love with: Billy Collins,
naturally.  Maybe Maya Angelou.  Jewel.

Fuck other poems.  You're here now,
stuck.  alone.  ha ha. just as
miserable as me, now probably more.

Hello and Recent Events

It's 8:23 in New York, and the government's been up and about
since 4. Fused networks wonder about our obligations both to look

and to snicker. In Lorca Square Park, the pigeons are gathering news
of each other's dreams, while squirrels replace the Post-its fallen

from the trees. Browsers set to their default preferences walk their dogs
through the streets, managing to take their revenge without attracting

the attention of a single eyewitness. Pleasant surprises await
at each and every corner. Trees that are landmarks of sorts give

quality sap, but there's no way of knowing how many remain
down in basements, calling things as they see them.

Dear potential contributor, I'm in cahoots with a hippie businessman down here in the raleigh/durham/chapel hill area to put out a
monthly art-related/"underground"/rocker tabloid, called The Blotter.

In order to get off the ground, we're soliciting content from anyone who might be intersted - comix, short prose, poems, photoessay/
journalism, etc. We're shooting for a march/april first issue, and need work asap in order to make mockups to show advertisers. No
money for a couple months, but we hope to pay a pittance to contributors in the future.

pls. send work to <ironbutterfly@throughthemoon.com> (submissions in the e-mail body, not attached!) or on paper to:
ignatz r. butterfly, PO Box 175 hillsborough, nc 27278. That's me, but a pseudonym to throw off the overeager graphomaniacs who show

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

                    Hemingway's _Green Hills of Africa_  (1935) could be
thought of as a cubist novel. It's about a two-month safari that's
structured around endless daily outings. The narrative of each outing is
highly repetitive, as if we're to have a plurality of perspectives on the
same object or event. Perhaps there's a subtext about Picasso's interest in
African art, I'm not sure.

                    I recently caught a documentary on de Kooning and here's
the best quote--
An older de Kooning is asked if he remembers the famous Picasso exhibition
in NY from decades earlier.
"Oh yes, I remember the Picasso. It was so wonderful. There were a lot of
cubes in it."



                Jed Rasula's _This Compost: Ecological Imperatives in
American Poetry_ is indeed pricey but it's been well worth it for me. It's
too bad the description that was emailed to the list says nothing about the
idiosyncratic and stylized language he uses throughout. He's not writing a
straightforward academic study with some thesis about nature and poetry.
Instead he lets his words take on the very ecological imperatives of the
title. Here's a random pick--

Thoreau's "prospectus of wild moods" (1)
"a compost of rhetorical jubilation"
"geophysical patience"
"a composting sensibility: attuned to the rhythms by which literary models
decayed and enriched the soil, Thoreau was prepared for his own notebook
entries (the ready mulch chronical) to fertilize and incubate the book that
was latent in them." (1)

Heraclitus's fragments "constitute a fiery particulate combustion like a
volcano spewing elemental chunks... into the atmosphere." (41)

"In its first fire Whitman's verse was magnificently tropic, a crisp,
biodegradable composition of the States (not yet "United" but cosmically
chaotic) into a demonized poetic topos... " (57)

"To work on a poem spanning fifty years (Pound, Zukofsky) or for several
decades (Olson, Johnson) demands not so much stamina as a persistent faith
in obscurity, working underground, in the dark, subscribing to indeterminacy
as the conditional atmosphere." (84)

"The sentences are workers, and the paragraphs are studios. Silliman's
[Ketjak & Tjanting] is a study in assembly relations. All the litter that
goes into production is left lying intact (or in pieces, most instructively)
on the floor of the studio amidst the more purposively delineated chunks.
The strategy is to recylce used sentences, supporting the frequency (as in
radio waveband) of their effects." (133)

Dung notes:

Of the lumps of dung he's used to prop paintings up, Chris Ofili has said
"Somehow it makes the painting feel more relaxed, instead of being pinned
upon the wall like it's being crucified. . .[The painting can] stand in
its own shit and watch the other paintings being crucified on the wall."

"The negative dung" is Royet-Journoud's phrase for the material
preparation, "heaps of prose. . .this impossible pretext," of his poems.

Beckett sees inscribed in a cowpad the figure of a heart.

Dung as divine emanation and detail of the great ensemble?

I really am NOT trying to be the Bible scholar-in-residence.  Its not a
position I'm particularly comfortable with.  But here goes:

Aldon Nielson wrote:

It's from the NIV.  The text of the NIV differs here from the Oxford
NRSV (which closely follows the King James wording in this passage.

NIV:
(Isaiah 40.26)
Lift your eyes and look to the heavens:
Who created all these?
He who brings out the starry host one by one,
and calls them each by name.
Because of his great power and mighty strength,
not one of them is missing.

Oxford NRSV:
(Isaiah 40.26)
Lift your eyes on high and see:
Who created these?
He who brings out their host and numbers them
calling them all by name;
because he is great in strength,
mighty in power,
not one is missing.

Now it IS quite interesting that the NIV is the edition used, because it
is traditionally a more conservative/fundamentalist version of the
Bible; it is the version that is most commonly used to evidence claims
that homosexuality is "sin" (Most Biblical scholars rely instead on the
Oxford NRSV, which has a more studied and more inclusive language).  It
could have been used because of the clearer reference to the stars;
however, Gerald's claim that the quote may have been "inserted by the
man's own fervent pitch" seems to be supported by the text quoted from.
In other words, Bush's policy decisions across the board might lead one
to believe that it is the NIV that he reads at long stretches.

I agree with Gerald that more equitable statements might have been
offered.  But I think if we asked the administration, then he might say
he was being equitable by quoting from a Judaic prophet instead of a
Christian one.  But Gerald's point is very well taken; a simple
reference to a higher power would have given the proper elegiac sense
without offending myriad other religions.

Again, I want to stress that I'm simply defending the rhetoric of this
one speech.  I disagree with a lot of the stances of this administration
(as an independent, I disagree with a lot of what EVERY administration
puts forth), and wholeheartedly understand your displeasure with Bush's
courtship of Bob Jones University and the administrations current moves
toward war.

All the best,

Thank you, Murat, for yr stimulating response. I do not have the time
to answer at length, altho I wish I did. What I will say, however, is
that:

(1) some of YS's illustrations (again most conveniently seen in the
1995 _Muae 1_) wd strike you immediately as cubist bc of their
compressed folding/suturing together of different perspectival planes
and of separate regions of space to construct associative links that
are all the same geometrically rigorous and coherent;

(2) I feel that I already partially answered yr question (what makes
the poetry cubist?) when I sd that   (a) some of YS's poems "were
based on recursively shifted presentations of geometric figures or
bodies" clearly named in the titles of the series and (b) at a higher
(or lower?) level "geometry, algebras, and post-Newtonian physics
become models for grammar and narrative events."

Now I enjoy yr your reference to the double (entwined?) trajectory of
purified reason/calculus and mysticism (a Kabbalah), but in the
particular case of YS, it's not the main trail. Yes, the mathematics
allowed him a convenient way to signify concepts of identity,
negation, reversal, symmetry, rotation, infinity, nothingness, etc.
and these were often manipulated in the narrative shadow of death,
where the mystic always transits. But YS's poetics is really a dada,
not a transcendentalism: of running a system down, no matter how
rational, shiny, and efficient (and therein lies the potential for
readings of it as an allegorical critique of Japanese colonial rule
and modernity), into decay or collapse. He was an iconoclast but
never projected light or a redemptive or healing realm beyond or
within the systems he reiterated into absurdity. Although he uses the
Icarus legend at several key moments (following Ryunosuke Akutagawa's
narrower use of the same figure), the manmade wings and all other
forms of flight are doomed from the beginning since they are based
purely on intertextuality (the wings are like pages in a dictionary
ruffled by the wind, he implies at one point). He never describes a
sky, sun or mountain peak worth flying up toward (the highest point
of observation in any of his pieces is the roof of a Japanese
department store in downtown Seoul that he reached in a
half-delirious state). Yearnings for freedom (from the body, poverty,
time, space, from personal memory) are seen as silly from the start
("feet that have kicked off their shoes falter in midair"). The
mathematical operations, although they demonstrate much, run without
any advent along the edge of death until they become either absurd
(in various ways) or fetishized rotations in a sealed-off chamber
(but more schematic than Barbarella!).

Sorry that's not nearly as inspiring as the concepts you broached,
but I think it's a more accurate characterization of the cubsim in
YS's poetry. His drawings are actually not as somber. / Walter

recent work, experimental television center.


alan and azure bat balloons and you know your arm tires, why, jennifer?

because i do think that you must stop your arm all by itself because the
balloon offers no resistance but the air itself.

and the air, jennifer, how does that work?

it works all the time and just see how the balloon slows.

his tiny little penis whips around with male abandon. her breasts and hair
fly against the balloon always struggling against the tiny air.

alan and azure walk across the frozen pond. thump thump thump.

why alan, says jennifer, i like the look of the sound of the footprints in
all the exciting snow.

thank you says azure, i was walking just to his right and watching the
microphone. it was most fun and look at the graph of the tilting picture.

azure plays with her balloon which moves against time mapping into space
along with the body of azure.

oh this is fun, says jennifer, i see you.

jennifer asks, why does the balloon change shape, why?

because it's mapping against time mapping into space., says azure, i
already told you that.

alan makes noises and waves his hands. jennifer says, look at the pretty
patterns, why, jennifer.

because, says azure, all sounds are things.

alan waves his microphones and the sounds make things.

alan and jennifer and azure hear nothing because sound things are silent.

alan yells and yells and colors come out of his mouth.

loud blue! says jennifer.

foofwa dances on a space capsule lozenge in stars across his eyes leaking

Thanks for the NIV info -- I'm old enough, and out of the loop enough, that
the New English Version was the last controversy I remember with clarity --

I didn't think the speech all that good; I don't automatically reject
things JUST because they come from the Bush administration (though I've
seen precious little to give me any cause for admiration so far) --

But, with the author of Isaiah, I look at the members of the administration
and ask, "Who created all these?"

Well, yes, that could be changed to say cubist travel writing or cubist
memoir. Hemingway is not very clear on the matter, as he says in the
foreward: "Unlike many novels, none of the characters or incidents in this
book is imaginary."

On the dung subject,

I just picked up _History of Shit_ by the late Dominique Laporte, trans.
Nadia Benabid & Rodolphe el-Khoury (MIT press, 2001) & it's really terrific.

Tom, years ago Walter Lew said something that stuck on my mind: Korean poets
used surrealism politically as a code language against the occupying Japanese
(?). This told me that each culture benefits from and uses another culture in
its own way; consequently, to see something like cubism or surrealism or
anything else strictly in Western terms is ridiculous, particularly in the
United States, since more than half of its population in a few years will be
non-western.

In that respect, your reference to Columbia is very apt.

...And Recent Events

It's 3:40 in Rochester, and the we-the-people government
that tries to frame the never-quit-satisfying negotiations
between the primitive impulse of vengeance & the civilized

rule of law, those agones are spoon-feeding the news-cycles.
In Midtown Plaza, just minutes ago, I walked past an
old woman singing to herself as she sidled along in

the opposite direction. I smiled to her but she didn't
smile back as she glided by and only after she
had passed did a wide chill tell me that beneath

her long, blue cloth coat she had no shoes, and
no feet, but was floating inches above the ground!
I turned quickly, but there was no one to be found.

And the first thought I had was: she
floats and floats; hears policy debates around her,
wars in deserts, on waters, in space -- centuries dim,

                                                    but she floats on.

I Reply:

Well, I can vouch for the Arielle Greenberg bit. Also the super fun bit.
If anyone out there ever gets the chance to go to St. Louis, as I did,
you'll find a wonderful group of poets waiting for you. Especially if
you're there for an Underwood Reading Series event.

Next month Underwood will have Kevin Prufer, Matthew

John Coletti, Tonya Foster, Greg Fuchs, Alan Gilbert, Mariana Ruiz-Firmat, Carol Mirakove, Anselm Berrigan & the list goes on.

Some were at Saturday's event. Some were not. But they all were addressing the "current reality" BEFORE those buildings came down.

right.  I'm not aware of the details as I'm far from an academic, but I was
trying to suggest in my awkward way that it might be worthwhile exploring
further.  We now can hear wind talk on the big screen down at the mall, a
brother defending students at the U of CO, a neighborhood shopkeep who
shares my addiction to a brand of cigarette my father spent his life
promoting, a 'public' library not interested in a copy of _Across the Line_,
etc., etc.  While this is happening in the heart of the heartland, just off
the route to the mall of all malls, much of the discussion even here on a
fairly cosmopolitan listserv seems to flurry around wisdom received from
cultural capitals I memorized and bowed down to long ago and this discussion
does seem to be just propagated on the internet for a variety of reasons
without input from the rest of the world?

Another possibly relevant train of thought might be the fate of Russian
Futurism and the tradition (possibly still alive, for all the US knows) of
underground and dussenting poetry.  I tend to attribute this particular
neglect to the lack of room on competency exams for more than one question
about futurism and the cold-war based pro or con funding for Russian studies
in the past but I'm sure there are other factors that were at play.

I may be going over the top again here, but it does seem to me that what are
needed are some new perspectives and possibly a rethinking of received art
history, for example.

Societies of American Poetry
Dissenting Practices

A symposium & festival at Georgetown University and the Folger Shakespeare
Library
February 20, 21, & 22, 2003

"What does not change / is the will to change."
                                                --Charles Olson

Whatever it is that motivates writing, it's safe to say that poetry has
some definite relation--of critique, indifference, support, reflection,
determination--to the society in which the writer lives. Over time this
relation will be thought in any number of ways, at one focus, to put it
crudely, the notion of the private subject writing for ends that remain
private or unknowable and autonomous from designs of utility, and at the
other an explicit programmatic intention to influence the reader's own
political commitments and conduct. "You're the only one who's earning any
money and yet you think that you can afford to have opinions." So then, in
the spirit of Brecht, this symposium will seek to prompt opinion &
reflection from poets on the sociality of art. The tacit problem could be
phrased in this way: what entanglements, collusions, collisions,
reverberations may be said to exist between poetic practice and the states
of America, in this era? Thinking America broadly as the site of imperium
and fluctuation--fissures--in the meaning of "our": poetry in our America.
That's the general drift and bearing perhaps upon the areas below, each one
meant to test poetry 2003, what it is or might be.


Border Zones

There are borders within the United States--between languages, races,
neighborhoods, categories in the census. Religions. A culture unsettled,
impure, double-crossed, bastardized--"another bastard in a world of
bastards" (W.C. Williams)--by flows in and out of bordered spaces--people
with their memories and speech--that fit in, that do not fit in. The
complex situation of border zones--how to talk about poetry from such
spaces, or poetry as such spaces made legible?


Field Work

The archive: written, read, preserved, circulated, lost, retrieved,
suppressed. Field work initiates a dialogue between practice and its
contexts. How might one understand editorial, publishing, archival, or
documentary work in relation to "art's social presence"? (Adrienne Rich)
What does this sort of work imagine for contemporary or future writing?


Performance Media

The move away from the orthodoxy of the book and printed page--towards
what? Poetry in the age of Story Space and Disney. Orality, digital
environments, body, image: a vigor, an expansion in the codes for
legitimate expression? An investigation into codes? Other sites for poetry
but with what cultural capacity, what interference into the general
cultural static?


Social / Lyric

An inquiry into agnosticism. How much does one know, does one need to know,
about effects? About intentions? Poetry is an individual
affair--expressive, subjective, fat with personality, aesthetic form. What
does lyric poetry do? Can one think of poetry as useful? With a social
function? If social, how is this function manifested? How to talk about the
relation between "social" and "lyric"? Where is the intersection
meaningful?

Rexroth's volume, 'The Art of Worldly Wisdom'
is composed almost entirely of 'cubist' lyrics. I might also
mention the long poem 'A Prolegomenon To A Theodicy'.
Other cubist lyrics appear sporadically throughout his volumes
even up until 1965 with the release of 'Godel's Proof'.
He experimented extensively in this area, and also believed that cubist
poetry was the future of American poetry.
Let me quote an essay by Morgan Gibson. Actually, instead of quoting,
here's the link, check out Chapter 3, 'Poetry is Vision-Vision is Love'.

Hi Hank: Nice poem - particularly the last line! I was at one of those
lovely 80th Birthday concerts.
I met him in his Aptos home once. He was a little bit of an art collector
and certainly knowledgeable of American painting. Without explaining the
origin of this, Bedford Arts, Publishers - of which I was the director -
published a book on the 19th Century painter Frank Duvenek's art and life
(Unsuspected Genius). You, as a relative local, may remember Hidden Villa -
the Quaker camp near Palo Alto established by his son, Francis and activist
daughter-in-law, Josephine, a great woman who, among many works, led public
demonstrations against the internment of the Japanese.
Anyway, Lou was enamored of the book, and I was enamored of the gamelons in
residence and sad that I could not be down there to come play in his weekly
gamelon workshop which was held in a special lovely ocean lit room.

Gary,

I'm sorry to say this on my first ever post but this does not work for me.
Maybe you are underlining apathy and thus critiquing it? Otherwise if you
are being genuine, if blah blah blah is what you really think of all this
'war talk', then this poem is very unappetizing to me.
         Or:
I find this unmistakably American apathy neauseating. It is clear that it is
at the heart of many third-world baby deaths. It is difficult to laugh off
third-world baby deaths. It is difficult to blah blah blah third-world baby
deaths. Or at least, it is difficult to take in poem form. I think you are
concerned about your own apparent lack of concern over the war, about your
emotional distance from everything that is happening, and that is why you
ask 'does this work?' Perhaps you are really asking, 'is this attitude
ethically happening?' No, it isn't. But the poem is useful in another way,
maybe, becuase it dramatizes what South Park cartoon characters might sing
about the war. And everyone knows that South Park characters epitomize
today's American youth, as far as any political matter is concerned.

Additionally, you dismiss all oppositional talk as equally blah. 'Too mushy'
I can hear you say, 'too lovey-dovey'. I am sickened. This is a cop-out, a
very, very old one. Even I know that, and I am 25. I think you could explore
your ambivalence in a more complex and interesting way.

Also, are you Canadian? What does the reference to Canadian politics mean?

Sincerely,
Sara

For the brits out bthere, and anyone else who might know:

I just received from a friend a column from the Daily Mirror by Tony
Parsons called "Never Forget," which screams revenge for a full page and
apparently hopes in the screaming to cover up the lack of connection
between Al Qaida and Saddam. What's the political slant of the Mirror in
general and Parsons in particular?

Thanks.

All this leads to an interesting question:  why so few english and american
cubist writers?  Indeed, Rexroth's early poems, Stein's Tender Buttons, the
later work of Walter Arensberg, and the early work of Yvor Winters are about
all we can claim.  Yet, all of them simply dabbled, then let go. Is it english
language poets themselves?  Is it the language?  Cocteau, Jacob, Salmon,
Reverdy, and Cendrars really dwarf our output.

Another question is why no spanish language cubists?  The spanish weren't as
ignorant as we were when it came to surrealism.  Of course, many of hte
spanish poets are the examplar surrealists.  But, am I overlooking spanish
cubists?  Its interesting that a movement that so dominated the plastic arts
was a blip on the page.

Which is why i mentioned stein's 'portraits'. Here 'geometric structure'
(although why geometric rather than 'spatial', and grammatical structure can
be analogized, and in fact--if I recall rightly, that is what Wendy Steiner
discusses in her Exact  Resemblance book. Stein describes the difference
between her portraits and Tender Buttons as between prose and poetry, which
distinction is grammatically based; that difference may be paralleled by the
shift in Picasso and Braque from analytical cubism to the paper collages.

i don't think stein's association was with "modern technology" so much as
with geometric shape.  this is what impressed her.

stein was making reference to geometric shape, except to say that "modern
technology" has made it possible for man to see the earth in a new way, from
above, for its geometric pattern ("the cubist paradigm," if you will).

but stein was not a cubist, and neither was jacob, and neither was wcw, and
all for one crucial reason.  neither made the analogy between geometric
structure and grammatical structure.  (and neither does kamber in his "max
jacob and the poetics of cubism," which is why his thesis is ultimately
unsatisfying, for all he writes about the transposition from one medium to
the other and the substitution of verbal coherence for painted surface.  and
neither does dijkstra, in his "cubism, stieglitz, and the early poetry of
wcw," where for all his talk about "time," and "simultaneism," he really
means "stereometric vision," which was coined by ortega y gasset and is
elucidated in "the dehumanization of art.")

"stereometric vision" seems to be the most explicative and clarifying
terminology for the most common interpretation of cubism (painting).  but in
my opinion, for the transposition of elements to be successful, the poet
must first comprehend the analogy between geometric structure and
grammatical structure.

the question then becomes, not "what will a cubist poem look like," but "how
will a cubist poem read"?  (however, this is not to suggest that a concrete
poem cannot be a cubist poem, both semantically and eidetically.)  for an
example of a cubist poem, i would humbly direct the reader to my poem, "the
galloping man," which can be found at:

http://canwehaveourballback.com/11thomasino.htm


although neither make the analogy with grammatical structure, the books to
read first, definitely, are: kamber, dijkstra, and ortega y gasset's chapter
on cubism.

Walter,

Thank you for your thoughtful, detailed response. YS seems to be an
absolutely fascinating figure, not at all uninspiring. I did not use
"mystical" in a redemptive sense, only that a system can not explain
everything within itself. When YS says, "The mathematical operations,
although they demonstrate much, run without
any advent along the edge of death until they become either absurd (in
various ways) or fetishized rotations in a sealed-off chamber," isn't he
implying a similar thing? Isn't death here, in Gary Sullivan's word, an
elsewhere? Stunning also how YS's words above remind me of Walter Benjamin's
words on translation, that it touches the original language tangentially.
Here is a short passage from my essay relation Benjamin to Spicer: "A deep
ambivalence underlies Benjamin's analysis of translation. While its impulse
is idealist, Platonic, contemplative, it is pregnant with disintegration, as
if unity (the mind) and explosive fragmentation pun in this transparent
arcade."

To me cubism has a utopian impulse to it, Stein (and maybe Appolinaire)
representing it best. When Stein says that from the airplane the American
lanscape looks like a cubist painting, she is also implying the United states
(the "invention place" of the aeroplane and the car) is the place of the
future. Fascinating, how YS subverts this impulse with dadaist virus. WL on
YS: "Although he uses the Icarus legend at several key moments (following
Ryunosuke Akutagawa's narrower use of the same figure), the manmade wings and
all other forms of flight are doomed from the beginning since they are based
purely on intertextuality (the wings are like pages in a dictionary
ruffled by the wind..." I once climbed by foot to the top of Gaudi's the
Sacrada Cathedral. As one goes up, through apertures at different flights,
one can see the the plastered wings of different holy ghosts close by.

Thanks.

Dick Cheney: The Invisible Man

"Ah! Now-" The Invisible Man stood up, and sticking his arms akimbo began to pace the study.

"I made a mistake, Bush, a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through alone.  I have wasted
strength, time, opportunities.  Alone-it is wonderful how little a man can do alone!  To rob a
little, to hurt a little, and there is the end.

"What I want, Bush, is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an arrangement whereby I can
sleep and eat and rest in peace, and unsuspected.  I must have a confederate.  With a confederate,
with food and rest-a thousand things are possible.

"Hitherto I have gone on vague lines.  We have to consider all that invisibility means, all that
it does not mean.  It means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forth-one makes sounds.
It's of little help, a little help perhaps-in house-breaking and so forth.  Once you've caught me
you could easily imprison me.  But on the other hand I am hard to catch.  This invisibility, in
fact, is only good in two cases: It's useful in getting away, it's useful in approaching.  It's
particularly useful, therefore, in killing.  I can walk round a man, whatever weapon he has,
choose my point, strike as I like.  Dodge as I like.  Escape as I like."

Bush's hand went to his hair.  Was that a movement downstairs?

"And it is killing we must do, Bush."

"It is killing we must do," repeated Bush.  "I'm listening to your plan, Cheney, but I'm not
agreeing, mind.  Why killing?"

"Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying.  The point is, they know there is an invisible
man-as well as we know there is an invisible man.  And that invisible man, Bush, must now
establish a reign of terror.  Yes-no doubt it's startling.  But I mean it.  A reign of terror.  He
must take some town like Baghdad and terrify and dominate it.  He must issue his orders.  He can
do that in a thousand ways-scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice.  And all who disobey
his orders he must kill, and kill all who would defend them."

"Humph!" said Bush, no longer listening to Cheney but to the sound of his front door opening and
closing.

"It seems to me, Cheney," he said, to cover his wandering attention, "that your confederate would
be in a difficult position."

"No one would know he was a confederate," said the Invisible Man, eagerly.  And then suddenly,
"Hush! What's that downstairs?"

This isnt meant to be crude or disrespectful.. but I have a secret and

that "Boy from Brazil".. Its really too bad there isnt a radical cultic

Hey, folks! I'm hoping you'll come on out to our POM2 Issue 3 Launch
party next Wednesday February 12 at 7PM at the Kelly Writer's House in
Philadelphia.

It's featuring poets **Rod Smith** from DC and New York's **Betsy Andrews**,

(both absolutely GREAT readers of their works) plus your grateful hosts
Allison
Cobb, Jen Coleman, Ethan Fugate and Susan Landers. We'll have issues of our
3rd
issue, all glossy and blue, just for you. AND it'll be a lot of fun.

AND it's the day Laura Bush planned her white house poetry tea party, and
cancelled it, and now it is transmogrified into "Day of Poetry Against the
War." So come on out for our launch, and we'll do some poetry up right --in
the
Writer's House.

For directions to the Kelly writer's house and details about the event, see
http://www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/   --hope to see you there!

Like a dull scholar, I behold, in love,
An ancient aspect touching a new mind.
It comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies.
This trivial trope reveals a way of truth.
Our bloom is gone.  We are the fruit thereof.
Two golden gourds distended on our vines,
Into the autumn weather, splashed with frost,
Distorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque.
We hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed,
The laughing sky will see the two of us
Washed into rinds by rotting winter rains.

 From Poetry Cancellation to Metaphysical Conceit!
___

The White House announced today that it is changing its emblem to a
condom because it more clearly reflects the Republican Party's stance.

 A condom accepts inflation, halts production, destroys the next
 generation, protects a bunch of pricks, and gives you a sense of security
while you're actually getting screwed.

_____

Not a bad piece of compression. I guess a WH official will have to talk how
to abort the consequences of "leaks".

The Poetry Project at St. Mark=B9s Church





POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

professional and timely manner. Areas of responsibility include, but are no=
t

independent contractor to manage its financial records and employs a
Certified Public Accountant to create the annual audit.

to ensure that Poetry Project=B9s programming and mission are favorably,
accurately, and frequently represented in all public arenas. The work of
writing press releases, designing advertising, giving interviews, etc. may

The Poetry Project, Ltd. at St. Mark=B9s Church



Since its founding in 1966, the Poetry Project, Ltd. at St. Mark=B9s Church
in-the-Bowery has served as a venue for public literary events and as a
resource for writ-ers. Housed in St. Mark=B9s Church in-the-Bowery, a landmar=
k
church in Manhattan=B9s East Village, the Poetry Project consistently achieve=
s
an integrity of pro-gram-ming that challenges, in-forms and inspires workin=
g
writers, while remaining accessible to the general public. Conducted in an
ambience that strikes a reasonable balance between formality and casualness=
,
the Poetry Project=B9s programs have been especially effective in allowing
emerging poets to strengthen their skills as writers and to develop
audiences for their work. For more established writers, reading, speaking o=
r
teaching at the Project provides the all too rare opportunity of presenting
work in a context informed by a thorough investigation of literary and
cultural possibilities. While being committed to the highest standards of
artistic excellence and to preserving vital literary traditions, the Poetry
Project has always encouraged the participation of new poets with diverse
styles. In fact, each year one-third of the writers presenting work at the
Project are doing so for the first time. The Poetry Project offers a
Wednesday night reading series, a Monday night reading/performance series, =
a
Friday late-evening events series; three weekly writing workshops, two
literary periodicals, a broadcast service, a web site, and tape and documen=
t
archives.=20

Zukofsky's valentines, etc., have the benefit of being family and
friends

Paul Blackburn, tho probably not "Love Song" which begins,

"Beauty is a promise of happiness

wa-hoo"

more erotic than love poems, I suppose:

William Everson, esp. River-Root, The Rose of Solitude
Lenore Kandel, The Love Book (I hope to do include w/ "Naked..." in a
New and Selected!)
Michael McClure, --
Diane Di Prima, --

N.C. congressman says internment of Japanese-Americans during World War
II was appropriate

        Wednesday, February 5, 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------------


(02-05) 09:09 PST HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) --

A congressman who heads a homeland security subcommittee said on a
radio call-in program that he agreed with the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II.

Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., made the remark Tuesday on WKZL-FM when a
caller suggested Arabs in the United States should be confined.

Coble, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and
Homeland Security, said he didn't agree with the caller but did agree
with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who established the internment
camps.

"We were at war. They (Japanese-Americans) were an endangered species,"
Coble said. "For many of these Japanese-Americans, it wasn't safe for
them to be on the street."

Like most Arab-Americans today, Coble said, most Japanese-Americans
during World War II were not America's enemies.

Still, Coble said, Roosevelt had to consider the nation's security.

"Some probably were intent on doing harm to us," he said, "just as some
of these Arab-Americans are probably intent on doing harm to us."

It was gratifying to see that the Secretary's staff have honed their graphic
capabilities. I was halfway expecting that to turn into a powerpoint
presentation . . .

Gary's main issue in his post to the list yesterday seemed to be with the
publicity for the Poetry is News event; mine was, and is, with the split
between politics and poetry and what the organizers called that "false
dichotomy" -- a characterization with which I agree.

I was really just looking for a report or review of what happened last
Saturday. I repeat that with over twenty posts referencing the event before
it happened, and with plans to somehow stage a similar event in Baltimore,
it seems odd that no one would post a follow-up report.

It would be hard indeed for me to attend New York events from Seattle.
Nevertheless, I admit I miss lots of poetry readings -- missed one just the
other night by James Tate (sorry, Chris S.) -- and it's true: my
non-attendance doesn't necessarily mean I don't share the poet's aesthetics.
But to the degree that non-attendance at Saturday's event *did* mean that
(for anyone who didn't attend) . . . well, I'd be interested in hearing
about it, that's all. The split between politics and poetry is a much more
necessary topic for me than what does or doesn't get referenced in New York
poetry events (although I'm glad to hear that the organizers might have been
mistaken, on that local level). As I said, I neverr quite seem to hear
enough about it.

To that end, and with the hope that it will provoke some discussion, here's
a transcript of what Eliot Weinberger had to say Saturday, intended for
public access. I thank Kent Johnson for forwarding it to me.

Joe Safdie
__________________________________________________________________________

Statement for "Poetry is News" conference
St. Mark's Poetry Project, NYC, 1 February 2003

Eliot Weinberger


I am both pessimistic and optimistic about what's happening and briefly, or
not so briefly, I'd like to say why:

First, I take the word "politics" in a very narrow sense: that is, how
governments are run. And I take the word "government" to mean the organized
infliction or alleviation of suffering among one's own people and among
other peoples.

One of the things that happened after the Vietnam War was that, in the U.S.,
on the intellectual left, politics metamorphosed into something entirely
different: identity politics and its nerd brother, theory, who thought he
was a Marxist, but never allowed any actual governments to interrupt his
train of thought. The right however, stuck to politics in the narrow sense,
and grew powerful in the absence of any genuine political opposition, or
even criticism, for the left had its mind elsewhere: It was preoccupied with
finding examples of sexism, classism, racism, colonialism, homophobia, etc.
-- usually among its own members or the long-dead, while ignoring the
genuine and active racists/ sexists/ homophobes of the right--
and it tended to express itself in an incomprehensible academic jargon or
tangentially referential academic poetry under the delusion that such
language was some form of resistance to the prevailing power
structures--power, of course, only being imagined in the abstract. (Never
mind that truly politically revolutionary works-- Tom Paine or the Communist
Manifesto or Brecht or Hikmet or a thousand others-- are written in simple
direct speech.) Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan was completely dismantling the
social programs of the New Deal and Johnson's Great Society-- creating the
millions of homeless, the 25% of American children who live in poverty, the
obscene polarization of wealth, and so on. (And the poets, typically, were
only moved to speak up when he cut the NEA budget.) Clinton might have had a
more compassionate public face, but essentially the political center had
shifted so far right that today the Democratic party is to the right of any
European conservative party, and the Republicans just slightly to the left
of a European national front party. We may never live to see an American
president as left-wing as Jacques Chirac.

The main result of almost thirty years of these so-called politics on the
left is that there are now more women and minorities in the Norton
anthologies, and we all know how to pronounce "hegemony"-- surely a great
comfort to the 4 million people, predominately black men, currently in the
prison system, or the teenage girls in most places in America who need an
abortion and there's nowhere to get help, or the parents and babies who
create the statistics of by far the highest infant mortality rate among the
technological nations, or the 20% of high school seniors who can't find the
U.S. on a world map.

The good news about the monstrosity of the Bush administration is that it is
so extreme and so out of control that it has finally woken up the left, and
once again we're talking about politics as the rest of the world knows it,
about people getting slaughtered, people being hungry, and people  as a
capitalist construct or queer musicology. The best news of all is that very
young people-- the generation of the Zeroes-- after the decades of MTV and
Nintendo somnambulism, are being politicized by the collapsed economy, the
prospect of a reinstituted draft, and the realization that their sneakers
are made by child-slaves in the Third World. Every political youth movement
has its own culture-- look at the 30's, the 60's, or radical Islam today. It
will be extremely interesting to see, and utterly unexpected to find, what
culture this youth movement produces: What will be their ideals and
practices, their music and poetry, or even their dress? I have a feeling
that we won't have a clue, and that their response may well be a sort of
iconoclastic asceticism, not unlike radical Islam, impervious to corporate
takeover, and completely alien to their parents. [One of the hardest things
for people my age to understand is that this is not 1967 all over again,
that things are going to be very different, and that, if we don't learn to
listen, we are going to end up being, as our old formula goes, part of the
problem and not part of the solution.]


I take this gathering as a kind of union meeting-- the union of writers,
mainly poets-- and it seems to me the primary question for us is: things are
going to be happening with or without us, are we going to be part of it, or
are we going to continue to talk about essentialism at the MLA and finding
your voice at the AWP?

Poets in times of political crises basically have three models. The first is
to write overtly political poems, as was done during the Vietnam War. 95% of
those poems will be junk, but so what? 95% of anything is junk. It is
undeniable that the countless poems and poetry readings against the Vietnam
War contributed to creating and legitimizing a general climate of
opposition; they were the soul of the movement. And it also resulted in some
of the most enduring poems of the 20th century, news that has stayed news
indeed.

The second model is epitomized by George Oppen, who as a Communist in the
30's, and a poet uncomfortable with the prevailing modes of political
poetry, decided that poets should not be treated differently from others,
that the work to be done was organizing, and so he stopped writing and
became a union leader.

The third model is César Vallejo, another Communist in the 20's and 30's. He
refused to write propaganda poems-- he wanted to write the poems he wanted
to write-- so to serve the cause he wrote a great deal of propaganda prose.

The first model (political poems) is the most common, and no doubt the one
we'll be seeing the most, and frankly it will come as a relief from all
those anecdotes of unhappy childhoods and ironic preoccupations with
"surface." Oppen, of course, was a kind of secular saint-- and most of us
are too egotistical to take a vow of silence. But it is the example of
Vallejo that seems to me the least explored.

People who are poets presumably know something about writing. So why does it
never occur to them to write something other than poems? There are
approximately 8000 poets registered in the Directory of American Poets--are
there even four or five who have written an article against the Bush
Administration? Most of us can't get onto the Op-Ed page of the Times--we'd
never displace Condoleezza there-- but most of us do have access to
countless other venues: hometown newspapers, college newspapers,
professional newsletters, specialist magazines, websites, and so on. All
writers have contacts somewhere, and all these periodicals must fill their
pages. Even poetry magazines: Why must poetry magazines always be graveyards
of orderly tombstones of poems? How many of them in the 1980's, for example,
even mentioned the name "Reagan"? How many of them today have any political
content at all?

I've been writing articles since Bush's inauguration for translation in they
at least help to demonstrate that the US is not a monolith of opinion.
Foreign periodicals can't get enough of Americans critical of Bush-- which
is why the collaboration of such supposedly antiwar poets as Robert Creeley
and Robert Pinsky in the recent State Dept anthology was so grotesque. If,
as they claim, they wanted to give Americans a human face, there was no end
of other forums abroad-- they didn't have to do it as flunkies for Bush.
More tellingly, the only public condemnations of that anthology have come
from foreign newspapers-- American writers were either indifferent or afraid
of alienating a future prize jury.

I do think they can be slowed down.

Thanks to Gloria and Mark for mentioning "Asphodel" -- and others for
Patchen.

I was wondering if anyone could help me remember a Muriel Rukeyser love poem
I read years ago which has always haunted me . . . the only (repeated) line
I remember is

"And yes, my love, we are looking at each other"

Even that might be a misquotation. Anyway, that one!

"Asphodel" would be at the top of my list, but there are a lot of other of=
=20
Williams' poems that are shorter and fill the bill (sorry).

Raises the question, tho, about what we mean by "love poem." "Asphodel" is=
=20
obviously a pretty complex take on a complex phenomenon that, for Williams,=
=20
at once involves withdrawal from the larger world and engagement with it.=20
Creeley, almost anywhere in the work through the 70s, is another=20
case--surely one of the best, but not a lot of bouquets of roses. Once the=
=20
love poem becomes more widely involved or more analysis than song of praise=
=20
is it still conveniently part of a genre unto itself? Of course, the same=20
could be asked of any genre.

Back to list:

Pound's "River Merchant's Wife."

Here's one from Gerrit Lansing:


A Ghazal of Absence
                                 (Blue Ghazal, for D.


If I had trained a gull I'd send it off to Boothbay Harbor
(like Solomon to Sheba, like Hafiz to his Friend)

bearing greetings and compleyntes of absence
from "the cypress envying your figure & the moon bowled over by your face."

The bird would say:             you there, captain,
though you are Absconditus my heart is touching you

sunrise to sunset the winds weave endlessly between us
& let of my Affection the boiling deepsea currents testify.

Lest the warriors of grief ravage your beauty (la Beaut=E9)
I send you the ransom of my self-love, keep it,

musicians will play out Gerrit's desire
in the mode of this poem which is like a "gazelle."


Mark

The Charm of the Highway Strip


objects in the mirror are mirrors
        backbeats help strip it clean
                we're watching Al-Jazeera & getting high
        beneath a gray anvil of history
where are the poets?  check the discos

ask a stranger I'm fast and danger
           past shiny convenence and
                cute but reductive theories of inaction
           come take a seat upon my anger sword
sonic booms that got stopped by God

they had big dicks for hearts
           black telephones for headlights
                 in thievespeak, how do you say
           "go ahead, gas up the family tank"
our boys march over hymens to victory

  the peroid always comes after the comma

  I am he she - she was or is he - he was always she -  or he -  I was
neither or both or someone that wasn't either - they were rich -  lived
on the other side of town -in a trailer park  -  the kind with no
shrubs and pickup trucks -  I always wanted to be them or him or her -
and  she wanted to be him and he her - especially during sex  when we
were all the same - but that was later when they moved away from our
hometown - a place I never knew -  I knew them only from a distance -
they were my neighbors -  we shared a room - my parents would leave and
each time they returned they would say I have a new brother - or sister
and brother -  or one of them died  but I never knew - than my parents
were taken away - I never knew my parents -  I grew up and a foster
home  and  then was moved to different foster home  and then if
different foster home -  it was a big house -  my family had lived
there for generations -  my grandmother or father -  they looked the
same -  lived in the room next to mine -  there always wore the same
clothes -  a mother or father of someone else would always get angry
when my grandfather or mother drank - it was mostly about my father who
was drunk all the time - especially after my mother left -  the one I
never knew -  I was too young -  that's how I got to know him or her -
we were both in the same burn unit- I was trying to quit smoking - they
were still on methadone but wanted a better life -  that's what they
got married  -  or that's what they told me when I got older - by then
they were dead and I only had a few pictures left of him or her -  on
at their wedding -  his first beer -  her first car -  the first time I
caught a fish as big as a pike - really a small sunfish -  I've learned
to sail  - the three of us would go  out alone on long adventures -
playing  pirate, president,  first lady and the tramp -  I was the
whore -  the one begging for mercy  after she or he was taken away by
the police -  I was right there - again with a bad report card - my
father or mother would slap me around -  by the time I was older and
have enough money to buy a car - the first thing I did was ask him out
- she came along - all the time I was driving my hand was on my leg -
the three of us smoking pot and drinking light beers - after our first
child - dressed in spandex - getting ready to enter my first marathon -
  I knew she or he would be my arch enemy - I would have to face them
eye-to-eye -  what could I say -  I was young I didn't know any better
-  I get caught in the moment  and besides I was  drafted -  I didn't
have some rich mommy or daddy -  at first I felt a little guilty -  but
with the fuck and it yale getting a fulbright - I was at the last march
with her or him - really - all I wanted it was to be fucked by her or
him -   or him as her or her as him - or be fucked as a him by her  or
her by him for her - but that was after I left my first wife,  husband,
  domestic partner - terrorist on the run since 1967 or  1997 - 1980's
the 1980's was  when mash  went off the air - I could so identify with
one of the characters - or all of them -  have been served in korea -
but that was different - that was the big -  we use the big one on
those japs - and even after I was in england or france -  I returned to
the same old whites only - until color TV started to come into vogue -
the three of us would gather to watch disney on parade - which I loved
especially when my parents were fighting - a would be alone  and every
once in awhile someone like elvis or the beatles - I just loved john -
or  something mick -  would be on the cover of the post I would buy
along with the national geographic - I mean I didn't know what got into
me - it was the first time I had seen someone else's penis or breast -
so we all sat around and jerked-off  and fondle each other - when I was
done I looked around to make sure no one was looking - the deserved it
wearing those clothes - short  skirts,  tight pants -  school
quarterbacks with those firm breast - that's what he or she or my
mother or father said  they liked best - of  vanilla sunday every time
after - or good cigarette or the movies-  especially on fridays -
anything to get away -  after work I would get in free - that's why
worked at the theater - I could live on popcorn, candyand juju beans -
every halloween  they called me the juju beans popcorn lady killer -
it was kind of a joke -  to  leave juju beans behind -  the popcorn was
a mistake but since it was there - it was the signature he kept doing -
  that I knew sooner later she would be the next class president - why
not he my sister - and as my parents said - to be alone in foster care
is the best of all holidays except for water when it's really hot.

A Question (s):

What do you do with very negative reviews? Or even well-intentioned
reviews that you think missed the point so badly as to be negative?

Which is, how do they affect you and/or your work?

How can you tell an honest negative review from a hatchet job?

Do you think people should write negative reviews? Or should they /
we just stick to positive reviews and ignore things we don't like?

Or any other questions you might want to answer (like: why in the
world did 21 million people watch Joe Millionaire this week?)

Why does the EPC not just publish, at a hidden URL to be disclosed only at

Roger Kimball is the enemy. I don't even know where to start in response to
his knee-jerk, petty response to the poets against the war project. The worst
moment comes with his endorsement of the Bush statement:

"While Mrs. Bush respects the right of all Americans to express their opinions,
she, too, has opinions and believes it would be inappropriate to turn a literary
event into a political forum."
I think there's nothing more important, more fundamental to the ART of poetry
than its engagement with the depth politics of language and society. I'm spittin'
mad. I'm glad no one is sitting here with me watching me fume. "She too has
opinions", oh poor thing, how will she cope!

Kimball's response is on the same level as the response I got from ibs
sufferers on the self-help bb so that probably shows the caliber of the
publication let let him write his 'review' if that's any consolation, JG

I do heartily agree with this and think it's a reflection of mid-USAcentric
inclination not to engage with anything - some librarians may personify this
(said in the realization that it doesn't apply to all librarians or even
feale librarians (as a former male librarian in the then female world - at
least mid-level world at that time)

having just self-diagnosed myself taoday as suffering from UA (unfocused
anger) and FP (finger-pointing) which I'm going to try getting accepted in
the forthcoming new edition of the DSM under the cultural Axis?

Oh and what about Gertrude Stein's incredible long love poem --

from Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Faded

I love my love with a v
Because it is like that
I love my love with a b
Because I am beside that
A king.
I love my love with an a
Because she is a queen
I love my love and a a is the best of them
Think well and be a king,
Think more and think again
I love my love with a dress and a hat
I love my love and not with this or with that
I love my love with a y because she is my bride
I love her with a d because she is my love beside
Thank you for being there
Nobody has to care
Thank you for being here
Because you are not there.

And with and without me which is and without she she can be late and then
and how and all around we think and found that it is time to cry she and I.

Anyone know where to find the Ted Berrigan poem that quotes (or more-or-less
quotes) Petrarch: "In 1327, at exactly the first hour of the sixth of April,
I entered the labyrinth," etc. I was certain that it's in A Certain Slant of
Sunlight, but it's not.

Thanks,

Michael

U.S. poet laureate opposes war with Iraq
HILLEL ITALIE
Associated Press
NEW YORK - The threatened war with Iraq has politicized the nation's
poets, starting at the very top.
In comments rarely heard from a sitting U.S. poet laureate, Billy
Collins has publicly declared his opposition to war and says he finds
it increasingly difficult to keep politics out of his official job as
literary advocate.

While at least three of Collins' predecessors also have stated their
opposition to war, an incumbent laureate usually sticks to art for
art's sake. Poets laureate are not political appointees; the selection
is made by the Librarian of Congress, a post currently held by James H.
Billington. Collins, who receives an annual stipend of $35,000, is
serving his second one-year term.

A spokeswoman for the Library of Congress said Tuesday that "Mr.
Collins is free to express his own opinions on any subject."

Collins, whose books include "Questions About Angels" and "Nine
Horses," is a mostly introspective poet who doesn't have a history of
political activism. But he defended anti-war poets who last week caused
the White House to postpone a symposium sponsored by first lady Laura
Bush.

"If political protest is urgent, I don't think it needs to wait for an
appropriate scene and setting and should be as disruptive as it wants
to be," Collins said in a recent e-mail to The Associated Press .

"I have tried to keep the West Wing and the East Wing of the White
House as separate as possible because I support what Mrs. Bush has done
for the causes of literacy and reading. But as this country is being
pushed into a violent confrontation, I find it increasingly difficult
to maintain that separation."

Collins, Nobel laureate Derek Walcott, former U.S. poet laureate
Richard Wilbur and about 40 other writers and artists signed an
anti-war petition last month.

In England, meanwhile, poet laureate Andrew Motion has written an
anti-war poem that cites "elections, money, empire, oil" as the
motivation for war.

Concern about a possible war has also changed what had been a
relatively positive relationship between Mrs. Bush and the literary
community. A former librarian who has made teaching and early childhood
development her signature issues, she has held a series of symposiums
to salute America's authors.

She planned a Feb. 12 forum on "Poetry and the American Voice,"
featuring the works of Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Walt
Whitman. Through her spokeswoman, Noelia Rodriguez, Mrs. Bush said last
Wednesday that it would be "inappropriate to turn a literary event into
a political forum" and postponed the forum. It has not been rescheduled.

Former poets laureate Stanley Kunitz and Rita Dove were among those who
refused to attend and Sam Hamill, a poet and editor of the highly
regarded Copper Canyon Press, organized a protest to send anti-war
poems and statements to the White House. So far, he has received more
than 3,600, to be posted on a Web site. Contributors include Pulitzer
Prize winners W.S. Merwin and Galway Kinnell and at least two state
poet laureates: Connecticut's Marilyn Nelson and South Dakota's David
Allen Evans.

"I'm not speaking as a representative of the state, I'm speaking as ...
a poet and private individual," Evans said. "I know it's an ambivalent
situation and I hesitated to contribute to the project, but I felt that
I needed to say I wanted peace instead of war."

New Jersey poet laureate Amiri Baraka said he will send a statement to
Hamill and is also working on a poem about impeaching President Bush.

"Of course, I see it as part of my job. The main task right now is
stopping the war," said Baraka, whose poem implying Israel had advance
knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks led critics to call for his
resignation.

as i've said elsewhere, i'm deeply troubled by both the tone and
content of weinberger's piece and i wish it were not being circulated
as representative of Poetry is News.

Kevin Davies  _ Pause Button _


Davies writing takes the social critique of the Language Poets and the
crushing ear of the best Projective versifiers and sets it all in
cyclotronic motion with his rapier's wit and caffeinated melancholy, making
him the Zorro of poets associated with Vancouver's Kootenay School of
Writing and the anthemist of choice for a disowned intelligentsia.  Davies,
who now lives in New York, published his second book, _Comp._, in 2000 to
much acclaim, but the quasi-legendary _Pause Button_, first published in
1992 by Vancouver's Tsunami Editions, has long been unavailable to those not
in the vicinity of Canada's choice used bookstores.


Deanna Ferguson _The Relative Minor_

Ferguson's first book of poems is at once frenetically impatient with
anything that could be called a lyrical subjectivity yet speaks, through the
sliced rubrics of its many "postmodern" poses, from a perspective singularly
angry, disaffected, vulnerable, eloquent, political and brash. The Relative
Minor takes the project of the Language poets to the next level of public
address, the scale tipping from (though not forgetting) the lexicons of
theory and falling toward the pure, dystopic clamor of punk aspiration.
Ferguson, who lives and works in Vancouver, has not published a book since
this 1993 volume, one of the major contributions by the poets associated
with the Kootenay School of Writing.


Richard Foreman _Now That Communism is Dead My Life Feels Empty!_

For years, Foreman has been staging his plays at St. Mark's Ontological
Theater with the regularity of the great Avant-Pop-in-the-Sky's
postmodernist pacemaker, tooling his "reverberation machines" into a
pristine state of subversive whimsy. Though the reader of this text will
miss the virtuoso performances of Tony Torn and Jay Smith as bathetic
superheroes dueling over the fallen Iron Curtain in the play's New York run,
the paranoiac frenzy and epistemological funboxes of Foreman's high style
are alive and flinching in _Now That Communism is Dead_.


Madeline Gins _What the President Will Say and Do!!_

Madeline Gins has mostly been known for her collaborative works with the
architect/philosopher Arakawa, releasing _Mechanism of Meaning_, an
illustrated series of playful epistemological vignettes, in 1979, and
devoting most of the last two decades exploring Reversible Destiny, a
radical philosophy of architecture in which one "refuses to die." _What the
President_ is Gins in a more light-hearted, accessible vein, her creative
assaults on mundane thinking arousing both laughter and caustic impatience
with the status quo. Rarely has a book appeared as prescient and poignant
twenty years after its initial publication.


Jessica Grim _Vexed_

Grim's style masterly evokes the simplicities of poetry in the "New
American" vein, with its fragments of candid observation just shimmering on
the surface of the poem, but she allies it with a "post-Language"
sensibility that balks before the prospect of a too-fluid Romanticism, thus
spicing sensual reverie with documentary relevance. The musicality of Grim's
poems is understated, the words delicately gathered, such that the poems
occasionally seem given over to indeterminacy and chance, but in fact each
one has a formal perfection that illustrates an underlying lyrical
integrity.


Peter Manson _Adjunct: An Undigest_

Adjunct _forms a teetering, overloaded bridge between practitioners of
subjectively-deodorized "conceptual literature" such as Kenneth Goldsmith
and Craig Dworkin and writers working in a "new sentence" vein such as
Language poets Bruce Andrews and Lyn Hejinian, all with a nod to novelist
David Markson's _Reader's Block_. But _Adjunct _is far from an organized
literary venture; rather, it is a sprawling, subconsciously assembled
stockpile of casual phrases, trivial ideas, worthless statistics, obituary
notices, self-reflexive misgivings, and numberless, numbing et ceteras that
make it an electric anthem to cultural (and personal) entropy.


Michael Scharf _Verite_

Scharf's poems are at once vulnerable to, and defiant of, the impositions of
civic society, as the strands of global and historical implication wafting
through the air that strike most of us as attenuated notes of "otherness"
are transformed, for this poet, into the throbbing heart of community. The
roving eye of _Verite_ takes in quantities of data that would sink writers
with a less fluid and agile lyric touch, and the mixture of journalism,
sonnets, "lieder" and manifesto-like prose poetry make this a compelling,
multi-faceted collection, the second by this New York author.


Ron Sillman _2197_

Silliman is known for several seminal long poems such as _Tjanting _and
_Ketjak_, and he has been involved in writing the long "new sentence" (he
coined the phrase) poem _The Alphabet_ for over twenty years. _The Age of
Huts_, published by Roof Books in 1986, has had a quieter reputation,
despite its relatively concise display of Silliman's wide formal
experimentation and mastery. "2197" is the second half of the book, and
anticipates, with its stock of phrases morphing and reappearing in different
acrobatic poses throughout its pages, the preoccupation with dataflows,
rhizomes and digital recurrence that has characterized much literature in
the age of the internet.


Ron Sillman _Sunset Debris_

Silliman is known for several seminal long poems such as _Tjanting _and
_Ketjak_, and he has been involved in writing the long "new sentence" (he
coined the phrase) poem _The Alphabet_ for over twenty years. _The Age of
Huts_, published by Roof Books in 1986, has had a quieter reputation,
despite its relatively concise display of Silliman's wide formal
experimentation and mastery. "Sunset Debris" is, structurally, a collection
of questions, but the cumulative affect of the queries is both giddily
intoxicating and, subterraneously, melancholic, as the voice of personal
entreaty become subsumed under the ceaseless rhythms of its literary method
and, by extension, time and memory.


Juliana Spahr _Response_

Spahr's deceptively simple language conveys a serious and complex assessment
of civic duty and the potential for political agency in a time when
selfhood -- one's sense of uniqueness and of the _permanence _of one's
personality -- has been severely compromised. Under fire by a mass media
that trivializes all values for the sake of ratings and shunned by the
opaque workings of a State that ignores, for the sake of control, the eye of
the radical democrat, the individual is, in Spahr's poetry, revived to take
center stage, floodlit by possiblity. _Response_, Spahr's first book (_Fuck
You-Aloha-I Love You_ appeared in 2001), was the winner of the National
Poetry Series in 1996, and demands of the reader a new sense of
participation in the social world.


Hannah Weiner _Little Books / Indians_

Weiner, who died in 1997, culled from what she considered a psychic
ability -- she literally saw words on the foreheads of her many New York
friends and transcribed them like extrasensory conversations -- to create
her typographically distinctive books of poetry. But there is nothing
na&iuml;ve about what Weiner was doing: she was a self-conscious,
sophisticated artist, a close friend of the great innovator Carolee
Schneemann, and has long been considered a central figure in Language
poetry. Weiner's oeuvre reflects a complex, totalizing investment in the
properties of words as they permeate and conflict with the self and the
imagined "other," and _Little Books/Indians_, long out of print, is both a
visual treat and an engaging read.


Mac Wellman _The Lesser Magoo_

The final of the four plays of Wellman's Crowtet, Magoo follows the
adventures of Curran and Candle -- an expert on "Crowe's Dark Space" -- and
their motley assemblage of peers, some of them categorically "unusualist,"
in the parallel, decidedly unsettled, universe that is distinctly Wellman's.
Magoo is chockfull of alternative histories, comprehensive pseudo-sciences,
eerily relevant, off-the-map absurdist politics and soft-spoken contacts
between humans all vying for attention in the seemingly self-propelled
linguistics of Wellman's versification, which at turns recalls Beckett, at
others the polymath Pynchon or the more childlike landscapes of Ashbery (in
Girls on the Run). The music for The Lesser Magoo, scored for voices, toy
piano, ukulele, and violin, was composed by Michael Roth, for both the Los
Angeles and the New York productions.


Darren Wershler-Henry _ The Tapeworm Foundry _

Toronto-based Wershler-Henry's last book of poems, _Nicholodeon_, was a
seemingly exhaustive survey of the possibilities of concrete and
process-based poetry in the Nineties, organized like a paper database with
icons to guide the wary reader toward conceptual handles. _The Tapeworm
Foundry_ is, in some ways, the opposite: a single unpunctuated sentence of
pro-Situ proposals that resembles a social virus more than a functioning
data-organism, its litany of avant-garde projects linked only by the
seemingly innocuous, but progressively more imperative-sounding, "andor."

CIRCULARS

statements and responses by poets and literary critics
concerning u.s. foreign policy

forgot this! ==> http://www.arras.net/circulars/

---

I'd like to announce the "soft launch" of a new multi-authored blog,
CIRCULARS. I'll refrain from laying out the specific intentions of the site
except to point to my original "mission statement" later in this email, and
to list the three purposes that I see the site serving:

1. To be a central message board for poets concerning significant actions or
events that pertain to progressive politics -- an "action center."

2. A storehouse of statements by poets, artists, etc., concerning US war
policy, etc., including updates on activities ("Debunker" mentality, reading
groups, etc.) -- the "conscience of the community."

3. A place to practice and investigate a form of writing I call the
"circular," which is that type of brief, quasi-manifesto (or humorous, or
polemic) statement that can be zinged around the internet (and also be
printed out) that contributes to the general pool of rhetorical strategies
(tones, tropes, emphases) that can be employed in making passionate,
relevant critiques of war policy, etc. -- a "workshop"

At this point I am the only editor for the site but I'm putting together
materials and will invite people to have author privileges to the site as
time goes by.  I don't want to just open the site up to everybody since my
fear is that it will quickly lose focus and become a glorified links site
rather than the workshop/activist site I envision.  I'm still working out
this structure; also, the design of the site, including sidebar, graphics,
etc., is rudimentary at the moment.  Other features will include guest
edited "sub-sites" that target more activist, or theoretical, issues.

PLEASE NOTE: because I'm presently the only editor, please don't send me a
flood of emails making special requests -- a nice note is always welcome, a
little feedback, yes, but for now I'd rather not spend too much time
answering emails as I'm quite busy putting together training materials,
designing the site, etc.

My hope is not to receive too many submissions until I have the editorial
structure in place.  If you do come across, or write, something you think
belongs here then, yes, send it on, but I have no intention of collecting
everything written by a poet that expresses anti-war sentiment -- there's
just too much.  Please read the statement below and look the site over first
before submitting -- this is not a literary journal.

THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO is to put your email address in the notification
list box on the upper righthand corner of the screen.  If you are receiving
this email it is either because you are in my private address book or on
some listserv that I'm a member of.  But I don't want to use my address book
to send out CIRCULARS announcements -- SO PLEASE LEAVE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS IN
THE CUTE LITTLE BOX.  (pwetty pwease?)

Take care,
Brian Kim Stefans

[Below is the original set of ideas I put together the insomniac night when
this website took shape in my mind. I hope to revise it and include it in a
sidebar to give the site some specific identity distinct from other
art/politics website -- a sense that this site investigates a form as much
as operates in the chain of activist sites -- but for now, I'll let it be
provisional.]

CIRCULARS: MISSION STATEMENT (v. 1)

CIRCULARS intends to focus some of the disparate energy by poets and
literary critics to enunciate a response to U.S. foreign policy, most
significantly the move to war with Iraq.

CIRCULARS intends to critique and/or augment some conventional modes of
expressing political views that are either entirely analytical, ironic or
humanistic. These are all valuable approaches, of course, and not unwelcome
on CIRCULARS, but our hope is to create a dynamic, persuasive idiom that can
work in a public sphere, mingling elements of rhetoric and stylistics
associated with the aforementioned modes -- analytical, ironic or
humanistic.

CIRCULARS is, in this sense, a workshop -- a place to explore strategies.

CIRCULARS was not created in the spirit of believing that all poets should
be "political" or even "social" in nature. While such arguments are free to
be made on the website, and poems related to the themes of the site are
(selectively) welcome, the focus is on articulating statements that are
unique to the poetry community while not speaking for "poetry."

CIRCULARS holds no party line, nor is it particularly adherent to notions of
the "avant-garde." All perspectives are welcome provided they are
articulated intelligently or (in some cases) amusingly, and that they do not
articulate perspectives or advocate actions that are, in the editors'
judgment, of an entirely unethical nature.

CIRCULARS understands that, in the world of the internet, the link can be as
powerful as word of mouth, and is itself the prize of an effective
rhetorical strategy. These are "circulars" because they are circulated.

What we want:

Original writing -- book reviews, manifestos, modest proposals, etc. -- is,
of course, most welcome, but also writing from listservs that are otherwise
not public, as well as statements originally appearing on other websites,
blogs or in print. (The content of CIRCULARS can appear elsewhere, but if
you do reproduce the text please include a link to the original page.)

Multimedia submissions are welcome. This would include pages that work
within the design structure of CIRCULARS involving visual, sound, animated
and interactive components. However, we don't plan on doing more than
installing a piece that the contributor has already completed, since we
don't anticipate having much time to collaborate on pieces.

Though the site's primary focus will be on opinion, announcements and
reports about activities related to the themes of this site -- performances,
readings, actions -- are welcome. Links to other sites, articles, scandals,
and events are also encouraged. Some poetry will appear here, but at the
discretion of the editors.

Structure:

Entries will be categorized and archives according to themes or, in some
cases, according to author. This system, however imperfect, will allow
visitors to the site to catch up on threads of dialogue with some ease.
Entries will also be archived according to month, as is standard with
weblogs.

There will be an unmoderated comments section, but the editors reserve the
right to cancel entries that are deemed offensive. This would include
personal attacks on individuals associated with the site, and comments of a
racist, sexist or otherwise demeaning nature.

Contributors are invited to utilize this space for open forums, with the
understanding that other material will intermingle with their own as it
arrives, and that this material might contradict the main focus of such
forums. In this case, a special archive category can be created linking
entries related to the forum.

Note on design:

The present design is just one of the standard templates of
movabletype.org -- we hope to make it a little more distinctive soon! Other
elements, such as a blogroll, links, etc., will be added over time. Any
feedback concerning the design of this site -- readability, functionality --
is welcome.

Stephen Baraban asked me to forward the following:

Could you possibly pass along these love poem
suggestions to the Buffalo List:

1)William Carlos Williams--"Of Asphodel, That Greeny
Flower"*

2)Elizabeth Willis--the poem beginning "conductor, you
knit me an isthmus"

3) Gertrude Stein--the prose poem beginning "soon it
is to be, as a wife had a cow, a love story"

4)lots of Creeley, but expecially the lines: "guises
are what enemies wear/you and I live in a prayer".

Hi Sara,

Thank you for your very sincere response to the poem. It can be sometimes
indimidating to be honest with negative responses on listerves in general,
so I especially appreciate your honest response to the poem. It's funny
because only a few days ago I had written something about poetry and
interpretation, about how "... one of the hardest lessons an artist must
learn is that, no matter how careful you are in your work (and in statements
about your work), once it has left your hands, it is truly 'elsewhere.'" (If
interested, see

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com/2003_01_26_garysullivan_archive.html#88276682

for the complete blog on that topic.)

Lew Welch has a poem, "Din Poem," that was constructed largely from
overheard material. (It's in Ring of Bone, his collected poems.) In addition
to racial/ethnic slurs and a song about the supermarket, it includes spoken
phrases one might have overheard on the street, such as: "Hey man, what's
happening. See you people later." In a way, my poem too was constructed from
troubling "overheard" material.

It is unclear how much of Welch's poem implicates Welch himself--I think he
wasn't entirely clear on that, either. I've been fascinated with/horrified
by this poem ever since I first read it, maybe 15-20 years ago. I've never
been able to get it out of my head.

"War Talk," my own version of a "din" poem, was created doing a Google
search on the phrase "War blah blah." It's vaguely OuLiPoan, in that I used
what came up via Google, in the order it came up, with almost no
manipulation.

It occured to me that it might be interesting to marry a word *meaning* a
violent, strategized eruption ("war") with an *actual* violent, strategized
eruption ("blah blah blah"), which I had overheard someone use,
dismissively, which is to say strategically and violently, on the subway
coming in to work that morning. The phrase ("War blah blah blah") reminded
me, too, of a certain line of Philip Whalen's: "I have to go to the ...
*library*." Whalen had overheard (or actually I think imagined) a
conversation that seemed to both upset him and amuse him, and he wrote it
down. It's in On Bear's Head, and may be in the newer selected.

The Google search yielded, as you can imagine, quite a bit of "din," which I
then lineated--or "Whalenated" in this particular case. None of the words or
sentiments are my own, including the (to me) ludicrious statement it ends
on: "I'm just seeing if this works," which struck me as how the poem had to
end: it was a phrase as dismissive--or, as you point out, "a cop-out"--as
"blah blah blah" itself.

Ultimately, the poem might be thought of as a kind of mini-documentary.
About a particular use of language. Which, yes, is horrifying, and, yes,
sickens. How much of it, the poem, might implicate its maker--me--is unclear
even to myself, though I do feel distanced from the general sentiment of the
poem.

The relative value of such a poem is no doubt debatable--and, in fact, I've
often found myself discussing that general topic with people who believe one
thing or the other, usually emphatically. For a number of different reasons,
sometimes political sometimes aesthetic, many poets feel that poets as a
whole need to work to narrow what I would call the "allowable spectrum" of
poetic activity. For some, the poem I posted--and "din"-like poems in
general--should not be undertaken, or that they are at the very least, a
risky proposition.

Anyway, again, I appreciated your honesty about this.

Gary

Interested idea, B.,
but I
also need to ask if someone who subscribes to the POETICS list is also a
writer for West Wing (for the non-USAers this is our new weekly 'reality
soap opera).
Either
that or I am hearing and seeing things coming through my TV screen that have
distinct echoes of list discussions of poets and presidents and poets who
are thought to be not normal in some way by virtue of being poets so
somebody is using somebody here or I must confess I wish I were pulling down
the salary of a script-writer who ndoubtedly won't confess until he or she
writes the real bio in a few years.

In any case, live is getting somewhat weird even though there are few other
positive things in the air these days?

Blood On Their Hands
by John Pilger
January 29, 2003William Russell, the great
correspondent who reported the carnage of imperial
wars, may have first used the expression "blood on his
hands" to describe impeccable politicians who, at a
safe distance, order the mass killing of ordinary
people.
In my experience "on his hands" applies especially to
those modern political leaders who have had no
personal experience of war, like George W Bush, who
managed not to serve in Vietnam, and the effete Tony
Blair.
There is about them the essential cowardice of the man
who causes death and suffering not by his own hand but
through a chain of command that affirms his
"authority".
In 1946 the judges at Nuremberg who tried the Nazi
leaders for war crimes left no doubt about what they
regarded as the gravest crimes against humanity.
The most serious was unprovoked invasion of a
sovereign state that offered no threat to one's
homeland. Then there was the murder of civilians, for
which responsibility rested with the "highest
authority".
Blair is about to commit both these crimes, for which
he is being denied even the flimsiest United Nations
cover now that the weapons inspectors have found, as
one put it, "zilch".
Like those in the dock at Nuremberg, he has no
democratic cover.
Using the archaic "royal prerogative" he did not
consult parliament or the people when he dispatched
35,000 troops and ships and aircraft to the Gulf; he
consulted a foreign power, the Washington regime.
Unelected in 2000, the Washington regime of George W
Bush is now totalitarian, captured by a clique whose
fanaticism and ambitions of "endless war" and "full
spectrum dominance" are a matter of record.
All the world knows their names: Bush, Rumsfeld, Rice,
Wolfowitz, Cheney and Perle, and Powell, the false
liberal. Bush's State of the Union speech last night
was reminiscent of that other great moment in 1938
when Hitler called his generals together and told
them: "I must have war." He then had it.
To call Blair a mere "poodle" is to allow him distance
from the killing of innocent Iraqi men, women and
children for which he will share responsibility.
He is the embodiment of the most dangerous appeasement
humanity has known since the 1930s. The current
American elite is the Third Reich of our times,
although this distinction ought not to let us forget
that they have merely accelerated more than half a
century of unrelenting American state terrorism: from
the atomic bombs dropped cynically on Japan as a
signal of their new power to the dozens of countries
invaded, directly or by proxy, to destroy democracy
wherever it collided with American "interests", such
as a voracious appetite for the world's resources,
like oil.
When you next hear Blair or Straw or Bush talk about
"bringing democracy to the people of Iraq", remember
that it was the CIA that installed the Ba'ath Party in
Baghdad from which emerged Saddam Hussein.
"That was my favourite coup," said the CIA man
responsible. When you next hear Blair and Bush talking
about a "smoking gun" in Iraq, ask why the US
government last December confiscated the 12,000 pages
of Iraq's weapons declaration, saying they contained
"sensitive information" which needed "a little
editing".
Sensitive indeed. The original Iraqi documents listed
150 American, British and other foreign companies that
supplied Iraq with its nuclear, chemical and missile
technology, many of them in illegal transactions. In
2000 Peter Hain, then a Foreign Office Minister,
blocked a parliamentary request to publish the full
list of lawbreaking British companies. He has never
explained why.
As a reporter of many wars I am constantly aware that
words on the page like these can seem almost abstract,
part of a great chess game unconnected to people's
lives.
The most vivid images I carry make that connection.
They are the end result of orders given far away by
the likes of Bush and Blair, who never see, or would
have the courage to see, the effect of their actions
on ordinary lives: the blood on their hands.
Let me give a couple of examples. Waves of B52 bombers
will be used in the attack on Iraq. In Vietnam, where
more than a million people were killed in the American
invasion of the 1960s, I once watched three ladders of
bombs curve in the sky, falling from B52s flying in
formation, unseen above the clouds.
They dropped about 70 tons of explosives that day in
what was known as the "long box" pattern, the military
term for carpet bombing. Everything inside a "box" was
presumed destroyed.
When I reached a village within the "box", the street
had been replaced by a crater.
I slipped on the severed shank of a buffalo and fell
hard into a ditch filled with pieces of limbs and the
intact bodies of children thrown into the air by the
blast.
The children's skin had folded back, like parchment,
revealing veins and burnt flesh that seeped blood,
while the eyes, intact, stared straight ahead. A small
leg had been so contorted by the blast that the foot
seemed to be growing from a shoulder. I vomited.
I am being purposely graphic. This is what I saw, and
often; yet even in that "media war" I never saw images
of these grotesque sights on television or in the
pages of a newspaper.
I saw them only pinned on the wall of news agency
offices in Saigon as a kind of freaks' gallery.
SOME years later I often came upon terribly deformed
Vietnamese children in villages where American
aircraft had sprayed a herbicide called Agent Orange.
It was banned in the United States, not surprisingly
for it contained Dioxin, the deadliest known poison.
This terrible chemical weapon, which the
cliche-mongers would now call a weapon of mass
destruction, was dumped on almost half of South
Vietnam.
Today, as the poison continues to move through water
and soil and food, children continue to be born
without palates and chins and scrotums or are
stillborn. Many have leukemia.
You never saw these children on the TV news then; they
were too hideous for their pictures, the evidence of a
great crime, even to be pinned up on a wall and they
are old news now.
That is the true face of war. Will you be shown it by
satellite when Iraq is attacked? I doubt it.
I was starkly reminded of the children of Vietnam when
I traveled in Iraq two years ago. A pediatrician
showed me hospital wards of children similarly
deformed: a phenomenon unheard of prior to the Gulf
war in 1991.
She kept a photo album of those who had died, their
smiles undimmed on grey little faces. Now and then she
would turn away and wipe her eyes.
More than 300 tons of depleted uranium, another weapon
of mass destruction, were fired by American aircraft
and tanks and possibly by the British.
Many of the rounds were solid uranium which, inhaled
or ingested, causes cancer. In a country where dust
carries everything, swirling through markets and
playgrounds, children are especially vulnerable.
For 12 years Iraq has been denied specialist equipment
that would allow its engineers to decontaminate its
southern battlefields.
It has also been denied equipment and drugs that would
identify and treat the cancer which, it is estimated,
will affect almost half the population in the south.
LAST November Jeremy Corbyn MP asked the Junior
Defence Minister Adam Ingram what stocks of weapons
containing depleted uranium were held by British
forces operating in Iraq.
His robotic reply was: "I am withholding details in
accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on
Access to Government Information."
Let us be clear about what the Bush-Blair attack will
do to our fellow human beings in a country already
stricken by an embargo run by America and Britain and
aimed not at Saddam Hussein but at the civilian
population, who are denied even vaccines for the
children. Last week the Pentagon in Washington
announced matter of factly that it intended to shatter
Iraq "physically, emotionally and psychologically" by
raining down on its people 800 cruise missiles in two
days.
This will be more than twice the number of missiles
launched during the entire 40 days of the 1991 Gulf
War.
A military strategist named Harlan Ullman told
American television: "There will not be a safe place
in Baghdad. The sheer size of this has never been seen
before, never been contemplated before."
The strategy is known as Shock and Awe and Ullman is
apparently its proud inventor. He said: "You have this
simultaneous effect, rather like the nuclear weapons
at Hiroshima, not taking days or weeks but minutes."
What will his "Hiroshima effect" actually do to a
population of whom almost half are children under the
age of 14?
The answer is to be found in a "confidential" UN
document, based on World Health Organisation
estimates, which says that "as many as 500,000 people
could require treatment as a result of direct and
indirect injuries".
A Bush-Blair attack will destroy "a functioning
primary health care system" and deny clean water to 39
per cent of the population. There is "likely [to be]
an outbreak of diseases in epidemic if not pandemic
proportions".
It is Washington's utter disregard for humanity, I
believe, together with Blair's lies that have turned
most people in this country against them, including
people who have not protested before.
Last weekend Blair said there was no need for the UN
weapons inspectors to find a "smoking gun" for Iraq to
be attacked.
Compare that with his reassurance in October 2001 that
there would be no "wider war" against Iraq unless
there was "absolute evidence" of Iraqi complicity in
September 11. And there has been no evidence.
Blair's deceptions are too numerous to list here. He
has lied about the nature and effect of the embargo on
Iraq by covering up the fact that Washington, with
Britain's support, is withholding more than $5 billion
worth of humanitarian supplies approved by the
Security Council.
He has lied about Iraq buying aluminium tubes, which
he told Parliament were "needed to enrich uranium".
The International Atomic Energy Agency has denied this
outright.
He has lied about an Iraqi "threat", which he
discovered only following September 11 2001 when Bush
made Iraq a gratuitous target of his "war on terror".
Blair's "Iraq dossier" has been mocked by human rights
groups.
However, what is wonderful is that across the world
the sheer force of public opinion isolates Bush and
Blair and their lemming, John Howard in Australia.
So few people believe them and support them that The
Guardian this week went in search of the few who do -
"the hawks". The paper published a list of celebrity
warmongers, some apparently shy at describing their
contortion of intellect and morality. It is a small
list.
IN CONTRAST the majority of people in the West,
including the United States, are now against this
gruesome adventure and the numbers grow every day.
It is time MPs joined their constituents and reclaimed
the true authority of parliament. MPs like Tam
Dalyell, Alice Mahon, Jeremy Corbyn and George
Galloway have stood alone for too long on this issue
and there have been too many sham debates manipulated
by Downing Street.
If, as Galloway says, a majority of Labour
backbenchers are against an attack, let them speak up
now.
Blair's fig leaf of a "coalition" is very important to
Bush and only the moral power of the British people
can bring the troops home without them firing a shot.
The consequences of not speaking out go well beyond an
attack on Iraq. Washington will effectively take over
the Middle East, ensuring an age of terrorism other
than their own.
The next American attack is likely to be Iran - the
Israelis want this - and their aircraft are already in
place in Turkey. Then it may be China's turn.
"Endless war" is Vice-President Cheney's contribution
to our understanding.
Bush has said he will use nuclear weapons "if
necessary". On March 26 last Geoffrey Hoon said that
other countries "can be absolutely confident that in
the right conditions we would be willing to use our
nuclear weapons".
Such madness is the true enemy. What's more, it is
right here at home and you, the British people, can
stop it.Reprinted from ZNet

What do you do with very negative reviews? Or even well-intentioned
reviews that you think missed the point so badly as to be negative?

        Accept that you can't control how others respond to your work.

Which is, how do they affect you and/or your work?

        There's something to be learned from any response. Being
criticized hurts, but getting a critical opinion from someone you have
reason to respect is not unlike receiving a gift.

How can you tell an honest negative review from a hatchet job?

        Read everything the reviewer's written. (Or, enough to figure out
whether he or she is just a jerk.)

Do you think people should write negative reviews? Or should they /
we just stick to positive reviews and ignore things we don't like?

        Should? Should? We don't need no stinkin should. My observation is
that people who talk about literary work who keep doing it without turning
into bitter shriveled weasels tend to respond as completely and generously
as they can. That does mean giving themselves leave to remark on
limitations, morbid tendencies, etc.

Hi Joe,

Thanks for posting the Eliot Weinberger paper. I actually had already read
it, on a site soon-to-be-made-public that was inspired by Weinberger's
paper. But I reread it again tonight.

I found the paper itself to be in part inspiring, but equally repellant,
divisive, counterproductive, and needlessly so. Inspiring, for me, was this
passage:

"People who are poets presumably know something about writing. So why does
it never occur to them to write something other than poems? There are
approximately 8000 poets registered in the Directory of American Poets--are
there even four or five who have written an article against the Bush
Administration? Most of us can't get onto the Op-Ed page of the Times--we'd
never displace Condoleezza [sic] there-- but most of us do have access to
countless other venues: hometown newspapers, college newspapers,
professional newsletters, specialist magazines, websites, and so on. All
writers have contacts somewhere, and all these periodicals must fill their
pages. Even poetry magazines ..."

This is great, practical advice. And, as I said, inspired at least one
website that you'll be hearing about soon.

What I found to be counterproductive was the extent to which Weinberger
seemed utterly incapable of  finding a way to avoid (a) grandstanding about
his own pre-9/11 politically-relevant activities (about which he is severely
delusional, and which is an aspect of another Poetry is News paper on the
above-mentioned site that serves no further function than to pound home the
equally delusional notion:  "I'M better than YOU," clearly an agenda that
might be dropped in sake of getting others involved); and (b) completely
dismissing--and potentially alienating--large numbers of poets who might
otherwise happily work with him.

(b) has much to do, Joe, with your own notion of the supposed split between
politics and aesthetics. Like, at this point, what the fuck does it matter?
What DOES in fact matter? Aesthetic differences? At this point?

To throw in a bit of "realism" here: The Bush administration seems bent on
attacking Iraq as soon as March. That doesn't give poets much time to
contemplate about who is writing the supposedly most "politically relevant"
poetry--as though this were something actually going to be decided in the
near, or frankly even distant, future. It is, in realistic terms, just
enough time to organize, bring people together, and stage a serious,
collective demonstration.

In order to do the above, poets have to be working together. I can tell you
one way in which you can be assured of poets NOT working together, of
instead being suspicious and hateful of each other: have one group of poets
call into question another group of poets' aesthetic practices! And, if you
really want to fuck things up, get a white American critic to discount
everything non-white poets have been doing over the last thirty years!

Enter Eliot "Action" Weinberger: "The main result of these so-called
politics on the left [langpo and the multicultural movement] is that there
are now more women and minorities in the Norton anthologies, and we now know
how to pronounce "hegemony"--surely a great comfort to the the 4 million
people, predominantly black men, currently in the prison system--"

Weinberger's solution? "the truly politically revolutionary works--Tom Paine
or the Communist Manifesto or Brecht or Hikmet or a thousand others ...
written in simple direct speech."

And these, uh, "thousand others," have fomented ... what? Exactly? See,
because, it seems like they've fomented--looking around for a moment at the
various political systems currently at play on Planet Earth--JACK SHIT.

Eliot, I love you, I even blurbed one of your books I loved it so much, but
you, darling, are  quite simply OUT OF YOUR FUCKING RACIST WHITE-CENTRIC
MIND. Let me get this straight: you want me to sit on "The Bus" for eight
hours with you? While you're spewing this obnoxious, thoughtless
aesthetically and racially prejudiced crap? Sorry, baby. I'll fucking rent a
car, if it comes to that.

Here's a Modest Proposal: Let's, for once, LOSE the dumbshit obviously
irrelevant aesthetic and racial prejudices and WORK TOGETHER for once. Eh?
Is that, Joe, something you're "for"? Because it sounds like the people
you're pushing here are not for that. It sounds like they're more for
settling Ye Olde Scores, like, uh, MY AESTHETICS ARE MAJORLY IMPORTANT;
YOURS ARE BULLSHIT kind of scores. It's Super Fucking Counterproductive if
one seriously hopes to bring together everyone on the left who might
conceivably HELP one's cause. Hey, not that the left has been anything but
segmented.

Again: In Camp A: A plan to bomb Iraq in March, possibly even carpet
bombing, resulting in significant civilian death, injury & trauma. In Camp
B: Self-important, supposedly politically engaged critic blathering on about
his aesthetic and racial prejudices. Hey, maybe I'm "reading too much into
this," but I don't see any connection between the two.

Joe, in all seriousness, do you?

In order to do what it is we all presumably want to do (quash Bush's war),
we need to work together, and do it now. It requires action by as many
people as we can possibly put together. In NYC there will be a demonstration
on February 15th. Pretty simple to understand: Be there. Maybe I should go
on & on about various poets' supposed lack of political engagement? You
think that'll encourage them to participate with us? "You stupid fuckers
writing in a way unlike our bland irrelevant Poetry Project Workshop
examples! You're fucking it all up for us!"

What utter fucking idiot imagines "putting together" people might possibly
begin with trashing the whole multicultural movement of the last thirty
years? "Hi, oh, uh, Ishmael Reed? Hi, man, how's it going? Yeah, Califia,
you know, great, it was a groovy book, man, but did it, like, free the
prisoners, baby? See, because we white people are thinkin' that, uh, see, we
got the straight dope, baby. Yeah, like me and Anne. And like, uh, we're
gonna, it's gonna, something's gonna--well, okay, we have no idea what we're
doing here, but, like, is it okay if we put you down, man? Like dis
you-all?"

Fuck Eliot Weinberger and the fucking white horse he rode in on.

And fuck Poetry Is News if they can't approach poets in some way NOT
involving old SCORES TO SETTLE. Let them fucking swallow that shit, eat
their pride, and be FUCKING HUMAN BEINGS LIKE THE REST OF US--as though they
had the wherewithall. Joe, are you actually interested in aesthetics, or
just interested in dismissing those whose aesthetics you don't agree with.

The Iraqis are going to be bombed no matter what dumb-ass prejudices we
short-sighted white morons have of each others' aesthetics. Unless we
ACTIVELY stop those who would bomb them. And that requires all of us. Anyone
actually putting together a program that includes EVERYONE, that doesn't
berate people, but rather encourages them, let us all know. We need to work
together. A foreign concept, Joe, to some.

Only at an academically sponsored symposium could anyone talk about "dissenting practices" with a straight face.  It seems that more than half of the participants in this event (as in so many others like it) are either professors of literature or college teachers of some other stripe.  But one always leaves one's sense of irony at the door at these things.

Aren't we tired of pretending that there are "dissenting practices" in contemporary U.S. poetry?  The professional pedagogue on a state salary who talks about "dissent" says--precisely--nothing.  The case of Tom Paulin at Harvard shows the real limit of poets' dissent at U.S. universities.  The academic poet who really wished to dissent from his/her "society" would attack the university.

There's a Cash and a Griffin and a Guthrie at the Ryman tonight.

Is this something we should cancel or ban or promote.  It's probably not
that dangerous poetry, though, and it's the heartland so let it go on.

Thanks to Kevin Davies and everyone else who has responded so far to my love
poem query. I will make a list of the poems people have cited and pass it on
soon.

Kevin, you asked about the general mood here regarding Iraq. I should start
by saying that there are a lot of things mediating my sense of what is
happening in the region. For instance, I live on campus (in a suburb of
Ankara), do not have a TV, and speak only a limited amount of Turkish.
There's an English Daily in Ankara, but not being able to converse easily in
Turkish or read the Turkish language papers makes it difficult for me to
keep an ear to the ground in any real sense. I get most of my information
online through the western news media.

I routinely quiz my students about their sense of what is happening. Some of
them express concern, but lack much of a framework for making sense of it,
besides economic sense. Bilkent is a private university. In the current
recession, we get only the very wealthy students and a handful of
scholarship students. One of my students runs an Ankara location of his
father's sauna business. He's partnered up with another student of mine who
operates his own real estate business. They will open a supermarket together
next month (all this while taking 7 courses at Bilkent). Their main concern
is understandably the effect a war will have on the value of the Turkish
Lira.

I sense a lot of resignation generally. Turkey is exercising not much more
than nominal autonomy in negotiations with the US over proposed use of the
Incirlik air base. It's essentially a no-won situation for Turkey. Opt out
and they lose the leverage of the world's most powerful ally, one that may
or may not be able to help them get into the EU. Opt in and they compromise
their principles, go against the will of the people, and risk huge damage to
the economy, a flood of refugees from northern Iraq, and a resurgence of the
Kurdish nationalist movement. Some 85% of the population is said to oppose a
war.

The new government is an Islamicist party that has pledged to keep Turkey's
secular structure intact and continue to court political acceptance by the
west. And yet, what they are being asked to do is aid and abet a war against
an, albeit corrupt, but nevertheless Muslim neighbor.

All these disincentives and yet there really is only one choice in the end
it seems. Just when it looked like Turkish opposition to a war was about to
force the US to make other arrangements, there has been an about face.
Yesterday, Abdullah Gul, the Prime Minister, declared that he would ask
parliament to pass a special resolution allowing the US to use Turkey as a
northern base of operations.

>------------------------------------------------------
>
>INTRODUCTION
>
>US media had suggest that Secretary of State Colin Powell
>was playing down what he would present to the UN Security
>Council about Iraq's alleged deceptions, weapons of mass
>destruction, and support for terrorism, so that when he
>made his revelations, they would have all the greater
>impact. Having heard Powell's presentation, it is now
>clear he was playing things down because his hand was in
>fact so weak.
>
>Powell's multi-media presentation was a rag-bag of old
>allegations, which the United States has been making for
>years, some of them based on information Iraq has itself
>provided to UN inspectors. Other claims were based on
>audio recordings and satellite images, and still more were
>based on unverifiable claims from unidentified human
>witnesses and "defectors." Powell all but admitted the
>weakness of his case by continually saying "these are
>facts, not assertions," at moments when he was providing
>the most sensational yet least supported claims. He also
>resorted to the comic book tactic of calling Saddam
>Hussein an "evil genius" for having succeeded in hiding
>what the US says is a vast arsenal, not only from UN
>inspectors, but from the world's only super power. Let's
>look more closely at some of the "new" elements in the
>American case for an immediate attack on Iraq:
>
>
>THE AUDIO TAPES
>
>Powell played what he said were intercepted conversations
>between Iraqi officers who were discussing ways to conceal
>prohibited materials from UN inspectors. None of the three
>recordings, if real, amounted to a "smoking gun." If they
>were real, they could be incriminating in a certain
>context, but they could also have been taken out of a
>context in which they were entirely innocent.
>
>The evidentiary value of the alleged recordings is close
>to nil. First, the recordings could easily have been
>faked, as the United States has a history of doing. In
>2001, US public radio's "This American Life," broadcast
>recently declassified tapes from a clandestine radio
>station set up by the CIA in the 1950s to help provoke a
>coup against the democratically-elected government of
>Guatemala. The radio station, which broadcast completely
>fake "opposition" voices, is credited with helping bring a
>repressive American client regime to power. (Program
>broadcast on 30 November 2001. See www.thislife.org for
>details.)
>
>More directly related to current events, New York's
>Village Voice newspaper reported late last year how,
>during the 1990s, a Harvard graduate student celebrated
>for his convincing impersonation of Saddam Hussein was
>hired by the high-powered, US government-linked public
>relations firm, the Rendon Group, to make fake propaganda
>broadcasts of Saddam's voice to Iraq. The student received
>three thousand dollars a month for his troubles. "I never
>got a straight answer on whether the Iraqi resistance, the
>CIA, or policy makers on the Hill were actually the ones
>calling the shots," the report quotes the ersatz Saddam
>saying, "but ultimately I realized that the guys doing
>spin (sic) were very well funded and completely cut
>loose." ("Broadcast Ruse: A Grad Student Mimicked Saddam
>Over the Airwaves," The Village Voice, 13-19 November
>2002)
>
>In 1990, another Washington public relations firm, hired
>by Kuwait, helped win support for the first Gulf War by
>fabricating claims, presented to Congress, that Iraqi
>troops threw Kuwaiti babies out of incubators. (see "The
>Lies We Are Told About Iraq," The Los Angeles Times, 5
>January 2003)
>
>Those taken in by that deception, will want to be more
>skeptical this time around. It also doesn't help US
>credibility that the Pentagon has repeatedly over the past
>two years stated that it would use deception and black
>propaganda to achieve its policy goals.
>
>
>SATELLITE IMAGERY
>
>Powell relied on satellite images in order to support the
>claim that Iraq is still producing and hiding chemical
>weapons. He said, for instance, that some of the images he
>showed were of the Iraqis "sanitizing" the "Al-Taji
>chemical munitions storage site" before UN inspectors
>arrived
>
>Again, it is impossible to tell if the satellite photos
>displayed by Powell are real, fake, old or new. But even
>if they are real, current photos of Iraq, they are by
>themselves of no conclusive value. The New York Times
>reported that American officials recently gave the UN
>inspectors satellite photos of "what American analysts
>said were Iraqi clean-up crews operating at a suspected
>chemical weapons site." But when the inspectors went to
>the site, they "concluded that the site was an old
>ammunition storage area often frequented by Iraqi trucks,
>and that there was no reason to believe it was involved in
>weapons activities." ("Blix Says He Saw Nothing to Prompt
>a War," The New York Times, 31 January 2003)
>
>For all we know the incident referred to in The New York
>Times is probably the same used goods Powell tried to sell
>to the Security Council. Only the inspectors can tell us
>otherwise.
>
>
>MOBILE UNITS
>
>Powell claimed, based on uncorroborated hearsay from
>"defectors," that Iraq has an elaborate system of mobile
>laboratories used for producing biological weapons. With
>no hard evidence, Powell was reduced to displaying
>"artists impressions" of what these laboratories
>supposedly look like, a tactic routinely used by American
>supermarket tabloids to produce pictures to accompany the
>latest stories of landings and abductions by space aliens.
>
>In an interview with The New York Times, Hans Blix, the

>
>
>IRAQ'S LINKS WITH AL-QAIDA
>
>Powell claimed that Iraq has close links with Al-Qaida and
>based this largely on the alleged movements of the
>threateningly unshaven gentleman Abu Musab Zarqawi. Prior
>to Powell's presentation, The Washington Post noted that

>exist between al Qaeda and Iraq,'" ("U.S. Effort to Link
>Terrorists To Iraq Focuses on Jordanian," The Washington
>Post, 5 February 2003)
>
>To make up for the flimsiness of the case, Powell resorted
>to building Zarqawi up into a frightening figure in
>exactly the way the US in previous years built up Usama
>Bin Laden. It seems that Usama, who is still on the loose,
>and who did not feature as a topic of Mr. Powell's
>address, has been replaced in American affections.
>
>Powell claimed that Zarqawi (who has now been promoted by
>the Americans to the status of "The Zarqawi Network,"
>complete with flow charts) was training terrorists in a
>poison-making camp in northern Iraq. Powell skipped
>dismissively over a very pertinent fact. Since the 1991
>Gulf War, northern Iraq has been out of the control of
>Saddam Hussein's government.
>
>The United States and United Kingdom have been cruelly
>bombing the illegally-declared northern and southern
>"no-fly zones" for twelve years, largely to limit the
>influence of Iraq's government to the center of the
>country. Northern Iraq has been ruled by competing Kurdish
>factions with United States backing. Since the 1991 Gulf
>War, the CIA has been operating freely in northern Iraq,
>and the United States recently acknowledged that its
>special forces are operating in that part of the country.
>Powell showed what he said was a satellite photo of the
>"terrorist camp." If the United States knows where such a
>camp lies, and has forces in the region, why has it not
>bombed it or attacked it, as it has bombed so many other
>installations in northern Iraq? An attack on a "terrorist"
>installation in northern Iraq requires anything but an
>invasion of the entire country. Furthermore, if the camp
>even exists, why would the United States give its
>occupants notice that it knows where it is, rather than
>just taking it out, as, say, it took out a car load of
>alleged "terrorists" in Yemen last year? It just doesn't
>add up.
>
>That the US is claiming that Al-Qaida-linked terrorists
>are operating in the part of Iraq not controlled by Saddam
>Hussein rather undermines the argument that Saddam is
>backing such people. Powell's only answer to this major
>problem in his case was to offer more unsubstantiated
>claims that one of Saddam's secret agents is in charge of
>the whole operation.
>
>In the days prior to Powell's presentation, numerous
>reports appeared in the American and British press that
>senior intelligence officials from the FBI, CIA and even
>the Israeli Mossad maintain there is no evidence to tie
>Iraq to Al-Qaida in any meaningful way. The BBC reported
>on 5 February that a top secret, official British
>intelligence report given to Prime Minister Tony Blair and
>leaked to the BBC states that there are no current Iraqi
>links with al-Qaida. The BBC added that the intelligence
>document "said a fledgling alliance foundered due to
>ideological differences between the militant Islamic group
>and the secular nationalist regime." ("UK report rejects
>Iraqi al-Qaeda link," BBC News Online, 5 February 2003)
>
>At the present time, it appears that there is a much

>when the Reagan Administration helped recruit men from all
>over the Arab and Muslim world to join what it called the
>"Afghan freedom fighters," than anything to incriminate
>Iraq. Mr. Powell said not a word about that.
>
>Underlining the weakness of the Anglo-American case, UK
>Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the BBC before Powell's
>address, that he had "seen no evidence which directly
>links Iraq to al-Qaeda, but I would not be surprised if it

>decisions about war and peace are made? More importantly,
>the Pentagon has brushed aside the lack of evidence, and,
>to the dismay of senior CIA and FBI officials, has
>exaggerated evidence for purely ideological and political
>purposes. It is the result of these political deceptions,
>not evidence, that was presented to the Security Council
>by Mr. Powell.
>
>Even if there were evidence of an Al-Qaida connection, the
>US claims that it wants to go to war to enforce UN
>resolutions. But no UN resolutions regarding Iraq say
>anything about Al-Qaida. Hence, even the attempt by the US
>to link Iraq to Al-Qaida must be interpreted as an act of
>desperation by an administration that knows it has not
>made its case on alleged weapons of mass destruction.
>
>
>IRAQ AND THE UNITED STATES
>
>Closing his speech, Powell sought to "remind" the Security
>Council that Saddam has been a horrible monster for more
>than two decades. He cited Iraq's use of chemical weapons
>against Kurds in 1988 as "one of the twentieth century's
>most horrible atrocities." He forget to mention, however,
>that at the time the United States, which was supporting
>Saddam in his war with Iraq, instructed its diplomats to
>implicate Iran. Powell also forgot to mention that among
>the long history of cooperation between the United States
>and Saddam Hussein's Iraq were the several meetings that
>once and future Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld held
>with Saddam at the request of President Reagan, one of
>them on the same day that Iraq was reported to be using
>chemical weapons against Iran.
>
>Nor did Powell point out that the same sort of satellite
>evidence that he now uses to indict Iraq was once gladly
>handed over to Saddam by the United States to help Iraq
>deafeat Iran. And in claiming that there is not a
>frightening disease in the pharmacology that Iraq is not
>capable of creating, Powell forgot to mention that the
>seed stock to make anthrax, E. Coli, botulism and other
>biological agents was exported to Iraq from a company
>based near Washington, DC, called the American Type
>Culture Collection, under contracts approved by the United
>States Goverment in the 1980s. These sales continued even
>after Iraq was reported to have used chemical weapons
>against Kurdish civilians. (see Iraq Under Siege, South
>End Press, 2000, p.39)
>
>Powell also sought to "remind" the Security Council about
>Iraq's horrible human rights record. He failed to explain,
>however, when the United States found its consicence on
>this matter which never troubled it in all the years that
>it was allied with Saddam. Such naked cynicism may yet
>fool some in an American public whose knowledge of history
>is notoriously shallow, and whose mass media scarcely dare
>challenge any administration's foreign policy, but it will
>not fool anyone else.
>
>Powell was also cynical to criticize Saddam Hussein for
>allegedly supporting Palestinian groups. Whether this was
>simply an attempt to grasp at further "evidence" is
>unclear. There are no known links at all between
>Palestinian groups fighting Israel's repression and
>Al-Qaida, despite the Sharon government's attempts to
>manufacture them for American consumption. What is
>certain, however, is that in the Arab world, the attempt
>to use any alleged support for the Palestinian cause as a
>justification to invade Iraq can only further alienate and
>inflame public opinion.
>
>
>CONCLUSION
>
>Taken together, the smorgasbord of old allegations,
>show-and-tell and hearsay that Powell presented would fall
>disasterously short of proving a case against an accused
>person in an American court of law, where the standard of
>proof must be "beyond a reasonable doubt." The flashy
>presentation did not conceal holes in the American case
>that a U.S. Navy battlegroup could sail through with room
>to spare. The Americans have argued that the Security
>Council is not a court of law, and that the standards of
>proof are different, and need not be beyond a reasonable
>doubt. But early in his presentation Powell himself used
>judicial language when he claimed that Iraq had earlier
>been "found guilty" of "material breaches" by the Security
>Council.
>
>The American legal system, often held as an example to the
>world, applies such strigent standards in order to protect
>a single accused person from being wrongly denied his
>freedom or life. If the United States attacks Iraq, not
>one accused person, but thousands of innocent people may
>lose their lives. The United Nations High Commission for
>Refugees estimates that 600,000 people may be forced to
>flee their homes, and millions more may well be exposed to
>hunger, illness, danger and chaos for years to come. Is
>all of this worth it, when, as France's President Chirac
>once again underlined on 4 February, that a perfectly
>viable, non-violent alternative exists? In response to a
>reporter's question about criticisms that one hundred UN
>inspectors cannot possibly disarm a country the size of
>Iraq, Chirac pointed out that the first inspection regime
>destroyed more Iraqi weapons than all of the deadly
>American firepower directed at that country in 1991 and
>since. The solution to any shortage of resources, if the
>inspectors should complain of one (so far they have not),
>said Chirac, is to increase those resources.
>
>Powell said that by passing Resolution 1441 putting in
>place the inspections last November, the Security Council
>has given Iraq a "last chance" to disarm. It appears that
>it was the United States that had a last chance to
>convince the world that what is needed instead is a US-led
>invasion of Iraq that could devastate the whole region for
>years to come.
>
>The early indications, judging from the speeches of the
>Chinese, Russian, French and other foreign ministers
>seated around the Security Council table, are that the
>world remains convinced that inspections should be given a
>chance to work, Iraq, which presents no immediate threat
>to anyone, should urgently do everything possible to
>cooperate, and as President Chirac said, "war is always

"A few days ago a poll in Canada found that over 1/3 of the population
regard the US as the greatest threat to world peace. The US ranks more than
twice as high as Iraq or North Korea, and far higher than al-Qaeda as well.
A poll without careful controls, by Time magazine, found that over 80% of
respondents in Europe regarded the US as the greatest threat to world
peace, compared with less than 10% for Iraq or North Korea. Even if these
numbers are wrong by some substantial factor, they are dramatic."

My favorite love poem is Ted Berrigan's "Red Shift"
I don't think it's so much of a stretch to see it as a love poem, thinking
about love as an both an exhaustive and energizing force, well, maybe
necessity. It's also just about the most heartbreakingly honest and sad and
powerful poem in my mind. I sort of see it as a love poem not only to his
friends and others but also to poetry, to the world of poetry or the world
that's created by poetry. And, I guess, to the way it can consume one.

noah

Yesterday I mistakenly posted an incomplete and corrupted version of Eliot
Weinberger's statement, which he read at last Saturday's "Poetry is News"
event in New York City; nearly 600 words had been left out near the end. The
full version follows, with apologies.


-------------------------------------------------------------

                Statement for "Poetry is News" conference
                St. Mark's Poetry Project, NYC, 1 February 2003

                                Eliot Weinberger


I am both pessimistic and optimistic about what's happening and briefly,
or not so briefly, I'd like to say why:

First, I take the word "politics" in a very narrow sense: that is, how
governments are run. And I take the word "government" to mean the
organized infliction or alleviation of suffering among one's own people and
among other peoples.

One of the things that happened after the Vietnam War was that, in the
U.S., on the intellectual left, politics metamorphosed into something
entirely different: identity politics and its nerd brother, theory, who
thought he was a Marxist, but never allowed any actual governments to
interrupt his train of thought. The right however, stuck to politics in
the
narrow sense, and grew powerful in the absence of any genuine political
opposition, or even criticism, for the left had its mind elsewhere: It
was
preoccupied with finding examples of sexism, classism, racism,
colonialism,
homophobia, etc. -- usually among its own members or the long-dead,
while
ignoring the genuine and active racists/ sexists/ homophobes of the
right--
and it tended to express itself in an incomprehensible academic jargon
or
tangentially referential academic poetry under the delusion that such
language was some form of resistance to the prevailing power
structures--
power, of course, only being imagined in the abstract. (Never mind that
truly politically revolutionary works-- Tom Paine or the Communist
Manifesto or Brecht or Hikmet or a thousand others-- are written in
simple
direct speech.) Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan was completely dismantling the
social programs of the New Deal and Johnson's Great Society-- creating
the
millions of homeless, the 25% of American children who live in poverty,
the
obscene polarization of wealth, and so on. (And the poets, typically,
were
only moved to speak up when he cut the NEA budget.) Clinton might have
had
a more compassionate public face, but essentially the political center
had
shifted so far right that today the Democratic party is to the right of
any
European conservative party, and the Republicans just slightly to the
left
of a European national front party. We may never live to see an American
president as left-wing as Jacques Chirac.

The main result of almost thirty years of these so-called politics on
the
left is that there are now more women and minorities in the Norton
anthologies, and we all know how to pronounce "hegemony"-- surely a
great
comfort to the 6 million people, predominately black men, currently in
the
prison system, or the teenage girls in most places in America who need
an
abortion and there's nowhere to get help, or the parents and babies who
create the statistics of by far the highest infant mortality rate among
the
technological nations, or the 20% of high school seniors who can't find
the
U.S. on a world map.

The good news about the monstrosity of the Bush administration is that
it
is so extreme and so out of control that it has finally woken up the
left,
and once again we're talking about politics as the rest of the world
knows
it, about people getting slaughtered, people being hungry, and people
deprived of basic human rights-- and not about language as a capitalist
construct or queer musicology. The best news of all is that very young
people-- the generation of the Zeroes-- after the decades of MTV and
Nintendo somnambulism, are being politicized by the collapsed economy,
the
prospect of a reinstituted draft, and the realization that their
sneakers
are made by child-slaves in the Third World. Every political youth
movement
has its own culture-- look at the 30's, the 60's, or radical Islam
today.
It will be extremely interesting to see, and utterly unexpected to find,
what culture this youth movement produces: What will be their ideals and
practices, their music and poetry, or even their dress? I have a feeling
that we won't have a clue, and that their response may well be a sort of
iconoclastic asceticism, not unlike radical Islam, impervious to
corporate
takeover, and completely alien to their parents. [One of the hardest
things
for people my age to understand is that this is not 1967 all over again,
that things are going to be very different, and that, if we don't learn
to
listen, we are going to end up being, as our old formula goes, part of
the
problem and not part of the solution.]


I take this gathering as a kind of union meeting-- the union of writers,
mainly poets-- and it seems to me the primary question for us is: things
are going to be happening with or without us, are we going to be part of
it, or are we going to continue to talk about essentialism at the MLA
and
finding your voice at the AWP?

Poets in times of political crises basically have three models. The
first
is to write overtly political poems, as was done during the Vietnam War.
95% of those poems will be junk, but so what? 95% of anything is junk.
It
is undeniable that the countless poems and poetry readings against the
Vietnam War contributed to creating and legitimizing a general climate
of
opposition; they were the soul of the movement. And it also resulted in
some of the most enduring poems of the 20th century, news that has
stayed
news indeed.

The second model is epitomized by George Oppen, who as a Communist in
the
30's, and a poet uncomfortable with the prevailing modes of political
poetry, decided that poets should not be treated differently from
others,
that the work to be done was organizing, and so he stopped writing and
became a union leader.

The third model is César Vallejo, another Communist in the 20's and
30's.
He refused to write propaganda poems-- he wanted to write the poems he
wanted to write-- so to serve the cause he wrote a great deal of
propaganda
prose.

The first model (political poems) is the most common, and no doubt the
one
we'll be seeing the most, and frankly it will come as a relief from all
those anecdotes of unhappy childhoods and ironic preoccupations with
"surface." Oppen, of course, was a kind of secular saint-- and most of
us
are too egotistical to take a vow of silence. But it is the example of
Vallejo that seems to me the least explored.

People who are poets presumably know something about writing. So why
does
it never occur to them to write something other than poems? There are
approximately 8000 poets registered in the Directory of American Poets--
are there even four or five who have written an article against the Bush
Administration? Most of us can't get onto the Op-Ed page of the Times--
we'd never displace Condoleezza there-- but most of us do have access to
countless other venues: hometown newspapers, college newspapers,
professional newsletters, specialist magazines, websites, and so on. All
writers have contacts somewhere, and all these periodicals must fill
their
pages. Even poetry magazines: Why must poetry magazines always be
graveyards of orderly tombstones of poems? How many of them in the
1980's,
for example, even mentioned the name "Reagan"? How many of them today
have
any political content at all?


I've been writing articles since Bush's inauguration for translation in
magazines and newspapers abroad and, if nothing else, they at least help
to
demonstrate that the US is not a monolith of opinion. Foreign
periodicals
can't get enough of Americans critical of Bush-- which is why the
collaboration of such supposedly antiwar poets as Robert Creeley and
Robert
Pinsky in the recent State Dept anthology was so grotesque. If, as they
claim, they wanted to give Americans a human face, there was no end of
other forums abroad-- they didn't have to do it as flunkies for Bush.
More
tellingly, the only public condemnations of that anthology have come
from
foreign newspapers-- American writers were either indifferent or afraid
of
alienating a future prize jury.

In English, I send my articles out via e-mail. It's one of the best
ways,
and certainly the easiest, to publish political writing in this country.
Send it to your friends and let the friends, if they want, send it on.
Let
the readers vote, not with their feet, but with the forward button.

The last time I was here at St Marks, in 1994, I was practically laughed
off the stage for saying that the major organizing force of political
opposition in the future was going to be the internet. Now of course,
it's
a banality. The internet has completely changed all the rules. It's how
the
like-minded instantly find each other; it's the one national and
international forum that has been-- so far-- impossible to control; and
it's practically the only source of opposition information and opinions
from everywhere in the world: not only immediate access to the foreign
press, but also-- if you really want to give yourself nightmares-- to
the
endless reports available from the Dept of Defense and right-wing think
tanks. That still-unrecognized prophet, Abbie Hoffman, said, almost 40
years ago, that if you want to start a revolution, don't bother to
organize, seize a television station. With the internet, we are all our
own
tv stations and publishing companies and newspapers. The potential is
limitless: Trent Lott was brought down by a weblog; all the doubts about
the war that are seeping into the general public began online; and just
this week  even lovely Laura's Poetry Tea got canceled thanks to an
e-mail
petition.

There are 8000 poets in the Directory, and Anne Waldman and Ammiel
Alcalay,
a month ago had trouble coming up with a list to invite to speak here.
One
eye may half-open when, like Laura's party, it directly involves them,
but
most American writers have lost the ability to even think politically,
or
nationally, or internationally. In all the anthologies and magazines
devoted to 9/11 and its aftermath, nearly every single writer resorted
to
first-person anecdote: "It reminded me of the day my father died..." "I
took an herbal bath and decided to call an old boyfriend..."Barely a one
could imagine the event outside of the context of the prison cell of
their
own expressive self. (Or, on the avant-garde, it was a little too real
for
ironic pastiche from their expressive non-self.)

We are where we are in part because American writers-- supposedly the
most
articulate members of society-- have generally had nothing to say about
the
world for the last 30 years. How many of those 8000 poets have ever been
to
a Third World country (excluding beach vacations)? How many think it
worthwhile to translate something? How many can name a single
contemporary
poet, not living in the U.S., from Latin America or Africa or Asia? In
short, how many know anything more about the world than George Bush
knows?

After thirty years of self-absorption in MFA and MLA career-mongering
and
knee-jerk demography and the personal as political and the impersonal as
poetical, American writers now have the government we deserve. We were
good
Germans under Reagan and Bush I; we were never able to separate
Clinton's
person from his policies and gave him a complacent benefit of the doubt;
and the result is Cheney and Rumsfeld and Ashcroft and Perle and
Wolfowitz
and Scalia and Rice and their little president. They can't be stopped,
but

About negative reviews:

A review is essentially a sign of a dialogue, taking place either in the mind of the
reviewer or on a larger scale, between "goodness" and "badness." Reviews are, at
bottom, displays of opinion, and the boundaries of the dialogue in which they figure
are entirely subject to adjustment and to error. (Yes, I do mean error.) So, a very
negative review, one which shows only the degree to which the work pertains to the
"negative" side of the dialogue, that which pertains to "badness," is a less than
trustworthy piece of writing. Because, after all, one of the terms of the entrance
into this dialogue in the first place is that of assessment, i.e., of what has been
done well and what has been done not-so-well, and if all we hear about is what has
been done not-so-well, then the very reason for reading (or writing) the review in
the first place goes out the window, unless we choose to view the reviewer as a
victim of his or her subject...

The proposition that only positive reviews should be written, though, is a strange
one. If only positive reviews were written, then the experience of reading reviews
at all would become boring and textureless, sort of like cold oatmeal. Not to be too
lofty, but reviewers are responsible for arbiting taste, and part of arbiting, I
would think, is honesty, and most reviewers who care enough about their craft and
about their subject to write a review in the first place would, thus, care enough to
be honest. And that means being negative, if necessary. But also expressing why it
is you like something, or why it moves you, or why it impresses you.

Of course, I've indeed heard it said that poetry reviews should always be positive,
because of the low place poetry occupies in our economy and in public interest. In a
sense, this is true, but then, in another sense, reviews of poetry are written for
the community of poetry at large, and so are intended for the people for whom the
"dialogue" I mentioned above is alive, and vital. And these people create, in a
sense, their own economy, their own market, their own currency, 90% independent. And
so reviews have a responsibility to shape that, uh, microcosm--while bearing in mind
what accomplishments have been made by the work which is their subject.

If the ancient Egyptians could (and did) raise their temple stones by
beating them with sticks to alter their gravitational resonance, it's not
impossible that poets "working together" could produce the practicality of
some like miracle.  What does "working together" mean?  "Appearing"
together?  Chanting together a la Ed Sanders' "Out Demon Out" performance at
the Pentagon in the late sixties?  Or aggressively pursuing one's
differences with each otherone so as to make the potentialities of power and
position of all involved more clear?

Gary,

Eliot's primary "humor" (in the Jonsonian/Burtonian sense) is contempt,
hiding maybe a core of pride; this is unfortunate because he is also such a
wonderful writer of strange prose.

Eliot I think carries a big wound, the reception of his modern poetry
anthology. In retrospect, the big clash between him and Amiri Baraka at the
Poetry Project years ago was a comic event, between two persons neither fully
aware of the effect of his words on others.

Recently someone told me "war quickens." The verb, someone else said , is
also used when a woman is about to give birth. I think many or most of us
are deeply immersed in a "quickening" as threatening war and the opposition
to it mounts and claims the collective consciousness. I am not sure anything
has yet "objectively" changed but the attention - critical and felt
responses - to all objects is intensified to the max (either as before a
birth or after a personally significant death).
All which is preface to say, I really enjoyed and found myself reading the
Newsletter closely. Instead of maybe often reading it not so closely (from
here in San Francisco), as either a reputation definer, a local community
news tool, whatever responses I think many poets may use as our common line
of defense around the potential real estate claims of others, less what
little of our own in this world be endangered!
Any way, a very interesting poem by Nick P (the last section '4' is
particularly terrific), but I was also intrigued "The Blank Generation"
Forumn on "The Blank Generation" where Lyn Hejinian is set up the elder
"fall" person (implying in an excerpt from an interview that new young
writing is mainly surface with no root or utopian aspiration) off of which a
number of mostly young poets speak on whether or not  politics juices their
work. (Reg E Gaines, Laura Elrick, , M Nagee, R Gladman, A Gilbert, and some
oldies with a view of the young, L Scalapino, E Torres and , J Yau. )
Naturally the young are mostly irritated by Lyn, and the responses are
variously refreshing, angry, and provoked.
Interestingly this discussion also has it's parallel counter-weight in Eliot
Weinberger's talk at Poetry Is News at St. Marks. I agree with Maria Damon
that Eliot's tone is off-putting (a bit self-righteous, but I suspect from
the point of view of one who was wounded by the emergence of the Language
folks, of whom there were many, by the way. It's great fault as a movement -
full of the righteousness of its own youthful oats and regardless of any
high mindedness of its utopian politics - was to come off as exclusive and
abusive of anyone seen as "old school." Plus the work was new and difficult.
I remember being a left a little speechless when more than once I was asked
by a non-literary therapist if I knew what "Language Poetry" was. They had a
deeply troubled patient, etc!)

It's going to be curious - and inevitably there will be divisions - as
Poetry As News, and other events, such as Sam Hamill's anthology become more
public and prominent. (I was thinking of Ron Silliman's "New Sentence" the
other day when I submitted a "prose poem" to Hamill's site. The thin width
of the submission column is (currently) designed to accommodate a not so
wide lyric poem. I had to watch the "horizon"  lines of  my prose  break up
its sentences into a lyric experiment - which was kind of interesting!)

But, at the moment, I sense most of us are being tumbled inside out as we
re-emerge with these utility issues of language/theory/politics/activism
around the impending war.  A personal experience perhaps reflective of this
change: last weekend I offered to take my son (25) and daughter (22) to a
movie. My son is totally into writing & performing hip-hop - some of it
political & definitely angry - making "beats" and large graffiti gestured
paintings. He has never read or took interest in poetry as this list might
know it. (I didn't read my parent's books either).  When I asked him for a
choice, the movie he wanted to see - thinking it would be "The Gangs of New
York" etc. , he said, "I hear there is a great one at the Castro". His
sister agreed to also go and we spent the late afternoon watching the
documentary of Noam Chomsky giving lectures on Terror. He and my daughter -
a graduate of primarily  apolitical UC Santa Barbara Campus  - both loved,
discussed it, etc.  This movie choice - and discussion - would probably not
have happened a year ago. Next Sunday they are both hot to go on their first
ever Peace Walk here in the City.
Plus que ca change....

KYLE CONNER AND MACGREGOR CARD
Kyle Conner received his M.A. in creative writing from Temple University in
1995, where he studied with Toby Olson. He has been active in the
Philadelphia poetry scene for a decade and has been published in numerous
journals, most recently in The Hat, Ixnay, and 6,500, with work forthcoming
in Oyster Boy Review. He has two chapbooks, Songs for South St. Bridge
(1996) and The Pulverized Thing of Doubt (2002). In 1998, he co-founded the
Highwire Reading Series (now La Tazza) in Philadelphia and co-curated for
two years. Conner has birthed a theory of the artist he calls "Oughtism"
(because you Ought to know), which makes the obvious explicit, i.e., that
art is never more or less than an extension of the way one chooses to live
one=B9s life. He is currently at work on a series of short erotic fiction
pieces and is reading Nabokov=B9s Bend Sinister.

Macgregor Card lives in Brooklyn. A chapbook, Souvenir Winner, was publishe=
d
last summer by Hophophop. Recent poems have appeared in Aufgabe, Lungfull!,
The Hat, Slope, East Village Poetry and Can We Have Our Ball Back. He edits
The Germ and Germ Monographs with Andrew Maxwell. And with Olivier Brossard
he is co-editing a New York School poetry reader for French translation
(Joca Seria, 2004). In 2000-2001, he was awarded a grant from the Providenc=
e
Gas Company. Relocating to Brazil next year, he will be launching a magazin=
e
for American/Brazilian poetries in translation.

WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 12 [8:00pm]
TRACIE MORRIS AND CECIL TAYLOR
Tracie Morris is a multi-disciplinary poet who has worked in theater, dance=
,
music and film. Her books include Chap-T-her Won: Some Poems by Tracie
Morris (1993 TM Ink) and Intermission (1998, Soft Skull Press). She has
toured extensively throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa and
Asia. Primarily known as a "musical poet," Ms. Morris has worked with an
extensive range of internationally recognized musicians and other artists.
Having participated in a dozen recording projects, her sound poetry has mos=
t
recently been featured in the 2002 Whitney Biennial. She has been
anthologized in literary magazines, newspapers and books including 360
Degrees: A Revolution of Black Poets, Listen Up!: Spoken Word Poetry, Aloud=
:
Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Caf=E9, The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry
and Soul: Black Power, Politics and Pleasure. Her words have also been
featured in commissioned pieces for several organizations including Aaron
Davis Hall, the International Festival for the Arts, The Kitchen, Franklin
Furnace and Yale Repertory Theater for choreographer Ralph Lemon. Recording
projects include: Goldberg Variations (Uri Caine) (2000 Winter and Winter
Records) and Project Princess, Our Souls Have Grown Deep Like the Rivers
(compilation, Rhino Records, 2000).

Composer, musician, poet, and performer Cecil Taylor has, since the late
1950s, been one of contemporary music=B9s most influential figures. He has
recorded dozens of albums including Jazz Advance, Unit Structures, Silent
Tongues, The Willisau Concert, and Port of Call. He has incorporated poetry
into his work in a number of ways over the years; in 1991 Leo Records
released Chinampas, a recording which presents his poetry accompanied by
multi-instrumental improvisations. Taylor=B9s poetry articulates a vibrant
acoustic space in which he summons and unleashes a complex material magic
that is thoroughly of the moment and for the ages. He will be reading from
his recent work.

Now is the time that older generations of poets get out of the business of
lecturing younger generations about what to do *now*.  Politically,
poetically, socially, whatever.  It could not be more tiresome or
irrelevent.  Your war was not our war.  Your answers won't be our answers.
If you don't get what we're up to, that's your problem, grampy.

Now is the time for the self-beatification of older generations to come to
an end.  Your poetic fights are not our poetic fights.  What have you done
for us lately, and why is that *better* than what I've done?

It's suddenly not enough to be a poet now--we need to march or sit or teach
or op-ed or whatever.  OK, but why should our art fall away, especially now?
  How 'bout we figure out what we can do: it can be a million things and a
million different things.  Must we all goose-step in unison to be heard?
No.

Where are the poets?  Hopefully writing some fucking poems.

Subject:      Left-justified Poets Against the War
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello all,

I am new to this list, but some of you may know me from various other
contexts.

First, I want to say that I wholeheartedly support and respect Sam
Hamill's "Poets Against the War" project, and applaud him for his
efforts in putting the project together.

Now, that said, I want to express my frustration with some of the
particularities of the project.  I find it peculiar that he's
segregated the site into the 'Search for a Poem' section and the
'Chapbook' section where "you'll find a selection of especially
powerful poems and statements by prominent poets."  I find this
binary grouping of the submissions troubling. This sort of
segregation into "the powerful poems of prominent poets" (apparently
Robert Creeley is not a prominent poet, or his poem is not 'powerful'
enough to make it into the 'Chapbook' section) and, apparently, "the
rest of the rabble writing poems"  seems to demonstrate the sort of
intellectual elitism that the right is always using to undermine the
efforts of the left, and antiwar movements in particular.  Especially
insofar as the only way to access a poem in the "Find a Poem" section
is to search by the author's name or email address.  Not all will be
as acquainted with the nuts-and-bolts of search engines as I and type
in one letter (e.g. 'C' to find 'Creeley') to list all of the poets
with last names beginning with that letter.

Some will say that this statement is merely sour grapes at not having
been selected for the 'Chapbook' section myself, but I do believe
that when one is making a public,political gesture, as Hamill is
doing with the website, one needs to take such details into
consideration.  I know enough of computers to know that it would
require no greater effort to link each submission by last name, in
alphabetical order.

Additionally, I received an email from the site last night saying
that because I had submitted a poem as an attachment to an email
(said email being sent last Sunday, January 26th), I would need to
re-submit the poem via the website.  Frustrated, but still willing to
participate, I went to the site and opened the 'submit a poem' link,
where I entered my name, age, location, and the title of the poem.
While there was no message indicating that HTML tags could be used in
the field, I entered the tags to bold my title, italicize portions of
the text which were to be italicized, etc.  Unfortunately I forgot
that HTML commands would be required to preserve spacing of the poem
on the page and was subsequently presented with a LEFT JUSTIFIED
version of my piece, which, as written jumps around on the page.  I
realize that formatting such pieces for someone without much
knowledge of HTML could be somewhat difficult, I find it odd that
such considerations were not taken into account in a system whereby
poets submit their poems.  Am I wrong in thinking that it is wise to
assume, in a post William Carlos Williams world that poets, even
non-prominent ones, are going to stray from the left margin with
their lines, and that this will perhaps be an important device in the
poems as written?

Could not this (sorry, I can't resist...) left-marginalization be
construed to indicate that what we (e.g. Poets Against the War)
assume to be poetry begins, necessarily, at the left margin and,
obliquely: is narrative, is anecdotal, is confessional....

I realize that this sort of niggling can be construed as infighting,
and thus would not bring this up except among colleagues.  But I do
believe that if one is going to make a public statement of dissent,
one which is bound to attract criticism, scorn, anger, etc. etc., it
is wise to have all of one's 'ducks in line', as they say, to make
the statement as viable, vital and representative of the ones for
whom one is speaking as possible.  I don't find that Mr. Hamill,
bless his soul for starting the ball rolling, is looking critically
enough at the manner in which the site is being handled.  The site
should present an egalitarian voice against the administration's plan
for in all of its incarnations and variances.  Presenting the work in
segregated categories, and without consideration for individual
poets' particularities of form undermines this.

All best,
Mark Lamoureux

Poets Against the War--

I think the "chapbook" selection flushes you out for what you're really up
to on your site.  It's a bold and innovative bunch:  Hayden Carruth,
Galway Kinnell, Sam Hamill, Gregory Orr, Marilyn Hacker, John Balaban,
Ursula K. Le Guin, Adrienne Rich, W. S. Merwin. "On this page you'll find a
selection of especially powerful poems and statements by prominent poets."
Really, will we?

What started as a fairly democratic endeavor, to let powers know what
American poets felt about the war has instead become a chance for *you* and
*your friends* to do so.  Cure, meet disease.  You've officially become part
of the problem.

Dear SPT list, I forward an announcement from Pam Lu. Elizabeth


Please join us for a very special evening of readings by

=== Ann Veronica Simon ===

with additional readings by
Alex Cory & Pamela Lu

Saturday, February 8
7 pm
21 Grand
449B 23rd Street, Oakland (between Broadway and Telegraph)
Free of charge, refreshments provided


Poet, prose writer, and scholar Ann Veronica Simon has long been one of the
quirkiest, funniest, and most poignant voices in the Bay Area experimental
writing community. Her work rallies humor, memory, dream, childhood
observation, idiosyncracy, and the private language of friendship toward a
unique understanding of the mysterious, wonderful, and often perplexing
world that surrounds us humans. Manuscripts include *My Life as a Mouth
Breather*, *A Dictionary of My Vocabulary*, and the more recent *Things I
Have Learned Since I Got Cancer*.

Since the summer of 2002, Ann has been involved in an ongoing battle against
brain cancer. Although her body has been afflicted, her mind and heart
remain vibrant, engaged, open, and active. Please bring your love, your
support, your prayers, and most of all your selves as we celebrate the gift
of Ann's words and extraordinary presence.

Admission is free and open to all. Refreshments will be provided.


For more information, contact Pam Lu (pamela.lu@efi.com).

In the last year I've turned down several offers to review books that I
thought were of no value but were likely to sink on their own without
leaving a ripple. I've written two reviews of books that had serious
problems and were likely to receive more attention. One rendered Max
Jacob's poetry unrecognizable in translation, the other, meant for
classroom use, distorted California Latino literature by forcing it into
conformity with a political agenda. I have no idea whether my reviews kept
anyone from buyinhg or assigning these books, but I hope so.

I can see no reason to write a negative review of a small press production
of an otherwise unknown writer, and there's little point in bothering to
slam, say, Billie Collins, in a journal whose readers already know the bad
news. But if a journal or newspaper whose readership is largely
unsuspecting were to ask me to write a review I'd take it as an opportunity
to deflate the bubble, not by invective but by analysis.

Bad art is often easier to read than good art because it strokes our
various sentimentalities  (Louis Lamour's westerns outsell Evan Connell's
Custer book by a factor of 10), which is why bad art which has made its way
isn't something simply to ignore--it drives out good art.

Is it not important to point out that we are already at war? I believe we are
meant to take the War on Terrorism as literal fact, since the government
does, and certainly the soldiers in Afghanistan have no choice but to do so.
Invading Iraq would be an expansion of the current war, though it requires,
ostensibly, a new resolution from the UN. The protests against invading Iraq
are often publicly spoken of without the context of the War on Terrorism
being applied, and anyone who is willing to protest this expansion is, for
the most part, well aware that war is already upon us.  In this vein, the
movement to oppose invading Iraq is not merely crying "war bad, peace good",
but attempting to exert public will (consciousness) upon the way the ongoing
war is being framed. The President believes his cause to be a moral one, and
the opposition to invading Iraq largely believes that pre-emptive invasion an
extremely immoral action. Of course, anyone might disagree with this,
particularly those who do not wish to see any of this described in moral
terms. But that's the tag and collar Bush has on the situation, and what he's
crushing his opposition with.

Dear Mark Lamoureux,

Agree mostly.  Did something similar and was asked to use the website, which,
as you notice, almost forces one into hugging the left margin lyric mode.
Also, I told my 8th grade daughter about the project, she writes poetry, she
recruited 40 kids at her progressive middle school to write anti-war poems.
I typed them all up (!) and sent them in a very accessible attachment.  Now
they have to each be re-typed separately into Hamill's little box.  Hamill's
done a great public service, without doubt.  Yet, the logistics of delivery
aren't the best.  Also, I disagree on one point in your commentary--the
"chapbook" poems don't represent non-mainstream poetries, hybrids of
narrative and lyric.  This isn't a complaint or in-fighting, simply
observation.  Sometimes, even when one is rushed for time, a collaborative
solution to a problem may work better than an individual choice.

Friends:

This is important.    It came to me just a few minutes ago (10 a.m. PST).=
  =


I live in Oregon  Peter DeFazio is our representative to Congress from th=
e
Eugene area.   I called his office just now, and what you will read below=

is absolutely true. We who hope for a peaceful resolution with Iraq can g=
et

Thank you for your attention and concern -- and for whatever you can do t=

Love and peace,   and read on, below,

Friends:
Please email  your Congressperson and urge  her/ him to sign onto Cong.
Pete DeFazio's bill repealing last October's resolution giving Bush a fre=

is
bill is pasted below.  Also listed are the Congressmembers who so far hav=

agreed to cosponsor DeFazio's bill. (Check if yours isn't on the list).
DeFazio filed this within hours of Colin Powell's speech to the UN, so

grow if you and others put pressure on your Congressperson.  Please forwa=

Pierre,

Thanks for forwarding this to the list. Tho I read more news sources on the
Web than I probably should, I didn't see this piece and I'm glad now I did.
When I posted the other day about the cancellation of the Laura Bush poetry
social, I took a swipe at Billy Collins that I now see was unfair. He
should be commended for speaking out as he has, as a poet.

>HILLEL ITALIE
>Associated Press
>NEW YORK - The threatened war with Iraq has politicized the nation's
>poets, starting at the very top.
>In comments rarely heard from a sitting U.S. poet laureate, Billy
>Collins has publicly declared his opposition to war and says he finds
>it increasingly difficult to keep politics out of his official job as
>literary advocate.
>
>While at least three of Collins' predecessors also have stated their
>opposition to war, an incumbent laureate usually sticks to art for
>art's sake. Poets laureate are not political appointees; the selection
>is made by the Librarian of Congress, a post currently held by James H.
>Billington. Collins, who receives an annual stipend of $35,000, is
>serving his second one-year term.
>
>A spokeswoman for the Library of Congress said Tuesday that "Mr.
>Collins is free to express his own opinions on any subject."
>
>Collins, whose books include "Questions About Angels" and "Nine
>Horses," is a mostly introspective poet who doesn't have a history of
>political activism. But he defended anti-war poets who last week caused
>the White House to postpone a symposium sponsored by first lady Laura
>Bush.
>
>"If political protest is urgent, I don't think it needs to wait for an
>appropriate scene and setting and should be as disruptive as it wants
>to be," Collins said in a recent e-mail to The Associated Press .
>
>"I have tried to keep the West Wing and the East Wing of the White
>House as separate as possible because I support what Mrs. Bush has done
>for the causes of literacy and reading. But as this country is being
>pushed into a violent confrontation, I find it increasingly difficult
>to maintain that separation."
>
>Collins, Nobel laureate Derek Walcott, former U.S. poet laureate
>Richard Wilbur and about 40 other writers and artists signed an
>anti-war petition last month.
>
>In England, meanwhile, poet laureate Andrew Motion has written an
>anti-war poem that cites "elections, money, empire, oil" as the
>motivation for war.
>
>Concern about a possible war has also changed what had been a
>relatively positive relationship between Mrs. Bush and the literary
>community. A former librarian who has made teaching and early childhood
>development her signature issues, she has held a series of symposiums
>to salute America's authors.
>
>She planned a Feb. 12 forum on "Poetry and the American Voice,"
>featuring the works of Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Walt
>Whitman. Through her spokeswoman, Noelia Rodriguez, Mrs. Bush said last
>Wednesday that it would be "inappropriate to turn a literary event into
>a political forum" and postponed the forum. It has not been rescheduled.
>
>Former poets laureate Stanley Kunitz and Rita Dove were among those who
>refused to attend and Sam Hamill, a poet and editor of the highly
>regarded Copper Canyon Press, organized a protest to send anti-war
>poems and statements to the White House. So far, he has received more
>than 3,600, to be posted on a Web site. Contributors include Pulitzer
>Prize winners W.S. Merwin and Galway Kinnell and at least two state
>poet laureates: Connecticut's Marilyn Nelson and South Dakota's David
>Allen Evans.
>
>"I'm not speaking as a representative of the state, I'm speaking as ...

Subject:      Report from Mytili Jagannathan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Here is an email I got from Mytili a bit ago. It's a much more measured
response to Weinberger's paper than my own, but even more importantly, she
reports on some of the other activities at the Poetry is News event:

* * *

Hi Gary,

I'm an occasional webreader of the Poetics list but not subscribed, so I'm
writing backchannel instead of posting. (Feel free to post this if you
want).  I read your recent response to the Eliot Weinberger's talk at the
Poetry Is News event on Saturday.  I came up from Philly and attended the
entire Poetry Is News event, so I thought I'd add my quick two cents.

First of all, from my perspective, Eliot Weinberger was not "representative"
of the day's events—-certainly not its spirit.  His was certainly the most
negatively berating speech that happened that day.  On the whole, I agree
with your (wow) dazzling rant about his comments—-both with what was useful
in his speech (the quote about the 8000 poets is something I definitely find
rhetorically smart and productively inciting) and with what was clearly
wrongheaded: true-leftist grandstanding and a white-privileged scapegoating
of multiculturalism.  At the time of his actual speech, perhaps because of
the breathlessly packed schedule and because the way one processes
information aurally is different from reading a written text, I registered,
but didn't focus on, the objections you raise that I obviously share with
you.

In any case, I don't really have much more to say about Weinberger, but I
did want to say that I appreciated the efforts of Ammiel and Anne in
convening the day's event: it energized me to come back to Philly and
instigate/collaborate with a broader range of "public sphere" actions than
the targeted work on the detention/special registration front I've already
been engaged in here in Philly. For me, the event was a sort of
high-intensity/information-rich/wake-up marathon.  Panel discussions
alternated with "Reports from the Field"—and I think the latter were
probably ultimately most effective.

Highlights were high school students from Bushwick speaking out with furious
clarity against the stepped-up military recruitment in poor communities; the
testimony of Rebecca Murray about her 3 months in the Occupied Territories
with the ISM; and Paul Chan, talking about his experience as part of the
Iraq Peace Team.  Anger and humanity.

I did feel that in the drive to be so "information-rich," the structure of
the day's events made it somewhat "dialogue-poor."  That was too bad,
because it meant that there wasn't really a chance to hear what the audience
would have said to a panelist like Weinberger—or to any of the others who
raised provocative points of view (there was cartoonist Ted Rall saying that
well-behaved marches aren't enough, we need to break windows).  The two
brief sessions allotted for discussion ended up being taken up mostly by
Feb. 15 announcements—-important, obviously—-but not really "dialogue."

Anyway, that's just my fast memory replay from my own moving vantage.  We're
all in it, as you say, so I'm trusting that the dialogue is happening
elsewhere, everywhere, all-at-once with the action.  (I won't be in NY, but
Philly's having coordinated anti-war actions here on the 15th.)

best,
Mytili

I'd be very grateful if anyone can direct me to studies in English of
the Italian novelist Sciascia  -  or treatments of recent Italian
literature that treat Sciascia among others.

Jim, Jim, Jim!  What are you saying?

Didn't you read Gary's eloquent, passionate message in response to
Weinberger?  We's needs to sticks togethers!

So what if most of these poets are not ones we would choose to read, and
even ones that we feel should be negatively criticized for various poetic
reasons?  So what if they're misrepresenting the diversity of ways in which
people arrange pretty words on paper in this country?  Would most of us be
much fairer if we were selecting poems for the "chapbook"?  These poets are
like us in the only way that really matters in this context: THEY'RE OPPOSED
TO WAR.  WAR BAD, POETRY GOOD.  Even bad poetry good compared to bad war.

Kasey

We are marching again on Feb 16, big time.  And there are tiny enclaves of

I second part of it. But the first part, well . . . slamming the "older
generations" is as "tiresome" and "irrelevant" as slamming the younger
generations. It always was. Let's not any of us goose-step, and let's not
slam any of them. I mean, if you can convince me that the whole generation
is self-beatifying, that would be something. But I don't buy it.

as a non avant-guarder a couple of lessons I learned were that a favorite
tactic in dealing with protest is to pay people to splinter movements.

another is to pay people to join up and push the envelope over the edge.

I don't think the shoe fits in most cases, either. When applicable, poets of
all ages should be posing and showing off their halos less.

Of course.  But that doesn't mean we can't give them shit.  If they are
going to continue to brag about the 3600+ poets that have contributed, they
shouldn't be afraid or ashamed to stand side by side with them in their
tough-to-navigate site rather than their exclusive "general's tent."

Not just his pals, right?  Every poet.  You and me brother.  You and me
sister.  If they're with us, they should be *with* *us*.

It's funny, but I did notice that when the site first went up. I'd sent a
poem before the site was there and saw the list of folks up at first and
thought, well, that makes sense in a way...put up the "names" to attract
others, or even, in some sense to "legitimize" the effort. My poem never
went up, but it didn't really bother me, being happy that the site's there,
that the sentiment's out there. But thinking about Jim and Mark's comments,
I DO see the problem inherent in the "general's tent" but I haven't made up
my mind as to it's effectiveness. What I mean is: most people have never
heard of us really (and by "us" I mean all 1,000 or so folks on this list,
no matter how many hits Silliman's blog gets) but maybe, or, I'd guess, most
likely, some of those folks in the "general's tent"  ARE recognized outside
of our mostly insular community of blogs, small presses, little journals
etc. Again, I haven't made up my mind, but it's the same argument I remember
hearing when I was more involved with the DIY punk scene. Collectives/Bands
like Chumbawamba who realized that if they wanted to really spread their
message of anarchist politics, of utopian worlds, had to "sell out" and sign
to a major label to get the word out as they were merely preaching to the
converted at the little basement shows etc. I don't know how I feel about
it, but I do feel.

I didn't arrive at the Poetry Is News event until the
last hour and a half, at 7:30 with a 9:00 p.m.
closing.  There was no charge at the door; the hall
was filled

There were three panelists.  I do not know their
names.  From left to right, there was 1st a cartoonist
(male), 2nd a man whose metier was never explained
while I was there (a journalist?), and 3rd a poet
(female).

The poet was finishing up her reading.  She read poems
mocking Bush's intelligence, "haikus."  The cleverest
of them was one about him discovering that a "cup and
a saucer work together."  She spoke about her national
origin, which was from outside the United States.

The cartoonist did most of the talking.  It may have
been because he was the third and final person to
speak in that last half hour.  Like the poet, he spoke
about the United States (government) in terms like
"capitalist," etc.

He described being in Iraq with journalists and a
fellow journalist, in his words, having the skin
literally torn off his body.  They attempted to rush
the flayed man to medical help by helicopter (he
described the size of the helicopters as immense, as
filling half the size of the auditorium we were in,
and empty of freight or passengers), but, he said, the
U.S. military personnel were under orders that they
could not transport any journalists or they would be
court-martialed.  The mutilated man died.  He said
that the government killed his colleague.  When asked,
he was not sure of the dead man's name; he said he
thought his first name was "Paul" (Peter?).

I believe it was David Henderson who asked a question
from the audience.  He asked if this had been reported
in the press.  The cartoonist said that the press is
now so silenced that it's like living in a third world
country where we have to read foreign and
international journalism just to find out what's going
on, but that, yes, it was reported in the Guardian,
etc., etc.

The journalist spoke a lot about "censorship."  He
said that there was censorship via things being
reported a single time.  He cited the adage about that
a thing has to be repeated "26 times" before anyone
will hear it.  He said that that is what the
Administration is doing: every day, the same line, ".
. . linked to Al-Qauda," etc.  He referred to a
Pulitzer Prize-winning Newsweek story that
subsequently was never repeated or heard of again.  I
don't remember what he said the story was about.

In the Q-&-A, a woman asked what he meant by
censorship at the newspapers, as she was not exactly
seeing that sort of thing.  The poet said that she
"hates" the New York Times and that she let her
subscription lapse and will generally not buy it; that
she'll read it on-line or if she's finds a newspaper,
but that she won't give them 75 cents.  A woman in the
audience said she no longer reads newspapers anymore
because it's too upsetting.

Ann or another moderator brought Paul Chan to the
microphone.  He is the (very young) man who is just
back from a month's stay in Baghdad as part of a
citizens' grass roots voluntary "peace-keeping" (?)
mission of maintaining a small, non-military presence
there (whose messages home Brian Stefans was
publishing on his blog). Chan said that they brought
the Iraqis basics such as aspirin and toys.  He spoke
about the imbargo-induced poverty briefly --- proud
skyscrapers reduced to disrepair because the imbargo
is preventing maintenance, children/people without
shoes --- but he spoke more about what a wonderful,
literate, cultural city it is.  He said it's a city
about the size of Detroit, which it resembles.  More
Iraqis asked him about Samuel Beckett than anyone ever
before in his life.  He read from his laptop a
recounting of Muslim New Year's Eve while there.  He
(was it another speaker?) talked about the new regime
of political Islam and how, recently, before the
religion-ification, Saddam Hussein was photographed in
night clubs dancing, etc., but that now he's only
shown praying, and that this semi-legislated piety is
part of what was keeping people away from New Year's
Eve celebrations.

The Q-&-A followed, some of it mentioned above.  Ann
Waldman was talking questions from the audience, but
also often breaking off to point out someone in the
house and some rallying event they were organizing,
many of them, a march, sign-making gatherings, geared
for a February 15th climax (the day of Laura Bush's
canceled poets' symposium).  A woman in the audience
asked about a resistance possibility different from
what Ann was sponsoring, and Ann said, in essence,
Well, that's fine, and why don't you go and do that if
you want to, but this is what we're doing.  Ann
mentioned their web site.

The organizers/panelists were talking about being
arrested, training sessions for being arrested as an
act of civil disobedience, how in New York that
usually just means a ticketing and an appearing before
the bench with subsequent lenient "parole" and that if
you don't do anything else for a while afterwards it's
erased from your record.  They were saying that if you
feel you can't be arrested, you can take political
action with your checkbook and make financial
contributions.

Well there are many good reasons to write negative reviews.

1) because you want to figure out what you think about a book.  I've written
negative reviews where I didn't know, when I started out, that they'd be
negative.

2) because it cheapens literary discourse if all the punches are pulled.
Who's going to take your positive reviews seriously otherwise?

3) because a lousy book may provide the opportunity to talk about other
things too

4) because it might produce an interesting or entertaining piece of writing

5) or there's something that catches your eye you want to share with people
without troubling them to buy the book.  I panned a book (very briefly) in
_Gig_ 12 largely because it had a blurb I found so stunningly & amusingly
offensive that I wanted the opportunity to quote it.

I should say that I think strongly negative reviews should be published
sparingly--you don't want to look like some smug jerk like William Logan who
seems to spend his life trying to come up with pans more viciously
aphoristic than Randall Jarrell.  What I've aimed for in my own reviews & in
editing _The Gig_'s review section has been: to be sparing of enthusiastic
praise; to be sparing of ugly pans; & instead try to have a fair number of
reviews in the middle.  The binary terminology of "positive" & "negative"
reviews is very misleading because a lot of poetry books occupy the excluded
middle & so should reviews.  Reviews should anyway be informative: tell you
what a book is _like_ & quote a bit, rather than rushing to plaster it over
with judgments.  Here again the thumbs up/thumbs down model of
"positive/negative" is misleading.

A sliver of window: cold nouns (poor nouns!)
licking eyes until white and soiled.

I bubble over unexpectantly.
A silver of pillage: the very core
of gesture  ruts with morning
depression; concave like logic, I

bundle up expressively. My country
colonizing. See those motion-sick
colors bloodying dirty eyes? My
country in winter turns to murder.

I turn to computer, soft and warm.
Handfuls of pelt-flesh smother
my face in voice recognition. I

think over and under it. Lovely people:

cold nuns (poor nouns!) in space.

Marianne Moore's "Love in America-"

Whatever it is, it's a passion-
a benign dementia that should be
engulfing America, fed in a way
   the opposite of the way
in which the Minotaur was fed.
It's a Midas of tenderness;
   from the heart;
nothing else. From one with ability
to bear being misunderstood-
   take the blame, with 'nobility
   that is action," identifying itself with
   pioneer unperfunctoriness

   without brazenness or
   bigness of overgrown
   undergrown shallowness.

  Whatever it is, let it be without
     affectation.

  Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Joe -

Growing up would require us all, in the face of having our names used to
endorse a crime of world-historical proportions, to eschew quibbling over
theories about motives until we have either prevented the crime or
apprehended the criminals.

Anyway, this comes down to whether you believe Bsh II is cynical and
corrupt or psychotic and moral.

"Grow up" -- what are you, a CIA plant?

Much love from your old subsub pal,

Okay, I personally may disagree that Bush BELIEVES his cause to be a moral
one...
but ultimately neither you nor I have any proof that the pres. is more deluding
than deluded.
It seems to me that Anselm does not need to "grow up" because he's willing to
take
Bush's talk of morals as what he really believes....

And furthermore the word "THIS" in your post seems, er, self-referential....

Joe, my friend, I do not mean for you to believe that -I- think this is a
matter of morals... I don't believe that Cheney, Rumsfeld, et all believe
this. Money, power, oil yes yes yes. But the big boy has to sell it, and I
think he believes it. You know? Bush gets a lot of mileage out of being
called a dumbass...

I also see that tone is still not so readable via e-mail, no?

I'm with Jordan here.  While I tend to think of Bush as cynical & corrupt,
it would take a hell of a lot of cynicism to proceed with what he's about to
do and NOT justify it to himself on some kind of "moral" grounds.  Of course
it is also a money grab, as well as payback for trying to kill daddy.  It
also provides a nice distraction from the tanking economy, & from the now
all but forgotten Enron scandal.  Plus, if Karl Rove is right, it will all
but ensure Bush's reelection.  The war is all of these things to Bush, but
the question is, is he merely a corrupt sonofabitch, or a sociopath.  I
definitely believe there are sociopathic tendencies in the Bush
administration.  I'm more likely to ascribe these to Cheney &/or Rumsfeld,
but that doesn't matter.  As Jordan, Gary, Mike & others have said, what we
need to do now is try & stop this war.  For everyone's sake I hope we
succeed.

Peace,

Mark DuCharme

Hey,

Aside from the Paul McCartney & Carl Perkins album
"We'd Go On For Hours" does anyone know a place I can
get a recording or soundfile of the Paul MCartney/Yoko

Ashbery's "A Blessing in Disguise" is a great love poem, though with the

The whole morality point really is the war's tagline & slogan, it's like a
movie poster: an epic battle of good vs. evil, which is what's so
frightening, as it also distances us so much from it. I wonder how many
folks there were sitting around a table somewhere saying:
"Evil empire?"
"No, too Star Wars."
"Axis of Evil?"
"humm, that's good, it's almost poetic."

noah

I will leave this alone after this post.

All I wanted to get across was 1) to reaffirm the condition of war as present
and not just imminent, and 2) that moral conviction, or the appearance of it,
is an extremely effective weapon for Bush -- one that is easy to dismiss as
false, and yet to be effectively argued against by his opposition, in my
opinion (only)... and I am part of that opposition, if that actually had to
be fucking made clear to anyone. Adios.

so far I haven't seen any visual poems mentioned,  while looking for a
piece by Emmett Williams (was it called "Hearts"?) I found this one:

first love
http://www.berliner-galerien.de/Wewerka/Kuenstler/Williams.html


& humbly, no one has mentioned their favorite love poem which they have
written themselves.  for my self I would offer the piece Maria D & I
wrote several years ago called EROS/ION

I don't if New Advice represents a sad, paranoid version of "growing up"  o=
r
primarily a tool for survival if the Moral is used to precipitate an
invasion and "democratic occupation" (talk about an oxymoron), but I do
suspect I wrote the following from down inside some psychic level in which =
I
am experiencing the apprehension and terror of the arrival of those moral
agents - read most probably the FBI or your local Homeland Security Rep -
the avengers whose job is and will be to clear the population of doubters,
unclean pluralists, the anarchists, anyone who might be working to take the
self-declared Vector off his Righteous course:


New Advice

Hold on to your hat, your coat, your shirt, belt, pants, underwear.
Close down your skin, your muscle, your bones, your blood.
Hang on to your sperm, your eggs, your delivery or receptive tools.
If they did not come yesterday, they will be here today or tomorrow.
They are not elected. They are self-chosen. If not chosen, they are
    appointed.=20
When they knock, point out the hole in their socks, the out of place whiske=
r
next to a beige mole on the chin. Nickel and dime them with petty truths:
The sky is green. The ocean is yellow. The poll results are "interesting."
If they press harder, talk about the sex life between you
and their well known director. Implicate yourself in the pleasure
of providing him or her with normally unspeakable acts. Somewhere between
the lapel and shoulder pad, the recorder is on. Your words will kill the
   tape.
This is evidence they cannot show or replay in public or private. It=B9s your
   word
against theirs. Call it  "a poetry of distraction." In the meantime,
beware the false landscape. Find safe shelter. Anything
may catastrophically drop during "breaking news". Look up
through dark coated glasses. Register the national 1-800 number. Report
instances of fallen debris. Photograph but don=B9t touch. Toxicity
may be frequent. Walk carefully. Preserve vision at any speed.

(sounds like a good place for a poetry conference --mIEKAL)


Liechtenstein for rent

Friday, February 7, 2003 Posted: 12:33 PM EST (1733 GMT)

ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Country for hire, one careful owner.

The tiny principality of Liechtenstein is putting itself up for rent in
a bid to attract corporate conferences and bolster its tourism
industry, a local official said Friday.

The new "Rent a State" program lets corporate clients symbolically take
over the tiny country of just 33,000 residents tucked away among the
Alps between Switzerland and Austria.

"The basic idea is that an entire, small country plays host to a
conference with all the various possibilities at its disposal," said
Roland Buechel, director of the state tourism agency in Liechtenstein,
which covers an area of 60 square miles.

Rent a State is based on the Rent a Village concept developed by event
management firm Xnet AG in small towns in Austria, Germany and
Switzerland.

Xnet will drum up business among corporate customers seeking a site for
meetings, while the tourism agency will work with local authorities and
help organize rooms and program ideas.

Customers will get tailor-made programs that put their brand on display
and involve local officials -- but not the monarch Prince Hans Adam --
in special events.

"It is not envisioned to include the prince or government officials,"
Buechel said.

I'm new to the list, but know some of you from other
fora.

I wanted to let everyone know about a non-profit word
consortium I've started to provide online resources to
writers called Eat More Words, on the web at
http://www.eatmorewords.org

The main member benefit is access to the online OED.
Generally for individuals a yearly subscription is
$550, but under the aegis of the foundation we are
offering a year membership at $10/year until we launch
on or around March 1. Membership will be $12/year
thereafter.

Please also sign up on the notification list.

Should membership revenue exceed the cost of providing
these services -- and we hope that it will! -- we will
launch The Apicule Literary Award, and may  publish a
book of poetry in cooperation with a small press.
Future features may also include a subscription to the
xrefer plus reference library.

There is more info on the site.

Eat More Words operates under the auspices of The
Apicule Foundation, which will begin offering
microgrants to artists in mid-2003.

Best,

Caterina Fake

Nations Security Council was dealt a serious blow when Britain's Channel =
4 News broke a story that severely undermines the credibility of the =
intelligence Powell used to make his case to the UN.=20
>=20
>Powell's presentation relied in no small part upon an intelligence =
dossier prepared by the British Government entitled, "Iraq - Its =
Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation." That report =
plagiarized large swaths of an essay written in September of 2002 by a =
graduate student from California named Ibrahim al-Marashi. Al-Marashi's =
essay appeared in the September 2002 edition of a small journal, the =
Middle East Review of International Affairs.=20
>=20
>According to the story from Channel 4 News, which was later augmented =
by an Associated Press report by Jill Lawless, the duplicate text was =
first spotted by a Cambridge, England academic named James Ranwala. =
Apparently, Ranwala read the British dossier when it became available =
and believed he had seen it before. As it turns out, he was correct. =
Entire sections of the al-Marashi essay, including six full paragraphs =
in one section, had been cut and pasted into the British dossier, =
including several spelling and grammatical errors that are identical.=20
>=20
>According to the Associated Press, al-Marashi had no idea his paper was =
being used by the British. "It was a shock to me," he told the =
Associated Press, and expressed the hope that the British would credit =
his work "out of academic decency."=20

last names suggest.=20

al-Juburi,(86) demonstrating how another non-Tikriti, but from the =
tribal alliance that traditionally support the regime holds top security =
positions in Iraq.(87)=20

security positions between Tikritis and non-Tikritis, in the belief that =
the two factions would not unite to overthrow him. Not only that, but by =
constantly shifting the directors of these agencies, no one can =
establish a base in a security organization for a substantial period of =
time, that would challenge the President.(88)"=20
>=20
>After a close analysis of the identical text from both reports, it is =
also clear that Britain altered key words to give their report a more =
sinister and ominous twist. The British report states that the Iraqi =
intelligence agency is "spying on foreign embassies in Iraq." The =
al-Marashi essay's version states that the Iraqi intelligence agency is =
"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq." The rhetorical leap from =
"monitoring" to "spying" is evident.=20
>=20
>In another portion of the British dossier, Iraq is accused of =
"supporting terrorist organizations in hostile regimes." The al-Marashi =
essay's version states that Iraq is "aiding opposition groups in hostile =
regimes." The insertion of the word "terrorist" is manifestly =
provocative.=20
>=20
>A disturbing series of questions is raised by this matter. Mr. Powell =
relied heavily upon "facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence," =
often from foreign intelligence services such as the British. His =
presentation was meant not only to establish the fact that Iraq is in =
possession of prohibited weapons, but also that Iraq enjoys ties to =
terrorist groups like al Qaeda. In light of this data, the factual basis =
for these claims is in doubt. Britain's report was touted as an =
up-to-the-minute intelligence review of the situation in Iraq. In fact, =
much of it is based upon the work of a graduate student who published =
his essay five months ago.=20
>=20
>Furthermore, if the al-Marashi essay was worthy of plagiarizing, why =
did the British feel it necessary to alter certain key phrases so as to =
make it seem that Iraq is spying on foreign embassies and aiding =
terrorist groups? The manipulation of the original data appears, on the =
surface, to have been done in bad faith.=20
>=20
>An analysis of the footnotes for the al-Marashi essay clearly =
demonstrate that his work was meant to describe Iraq's intelligence =
apparatus and military situation in the 1990s. The British dossier was =
presented as an up-to-date report on the status of Iraq's weapons and =
terrorist ties. There are 106 reference footnotes in the essay. 103 of =
these footnotes reference reports and articles from 1988 to 2000. Only =
three are from this century, and all of them reference reports from =
2001. This is not current data in any context.=20
>=20
>Clearly, Mr. Powell cannot be held responsible for the veracity of data =
given to him by the British government. The fact remains, however, that =
the British intelligence data, which comes from the most steadfast ally =
of the Bush administration, has been severely undermined by this report. =
This calls into question the veracity of virtually every aspect of =
Powell's presentation to the United Nations.=20
>=20
>If the American Secretary of State was given such shoddily-assembled =
data from its most loyal ally, how can the rest of the data be =
considered dependable? The data on Zarqawi and Ansar al-Islam came from =
Jordanian intelligence, a source much less trustworthy than the British. =
Many of the "human sources" cited by Powell were, in fact, detainees in =
Guantanamo, Cuba. These sources are suspect at best, yet were a =
significant part of the basis for Powell's accusations that Iraq is =
working with al Qaeda and developing a wide variety of prohibited =
weapons. Between these sources and the unreliable data from the British, =
it seems all too clear that Powell's entire presentation was based upon =
information that is questionable to say the least.=20
>=20
>Finally, and most significantly, is the question of intent. The United =
States will have soon placed approximately 150,000 troops in the region =
surrounding Iraq with the full intention of going to war. Such a =
conflict is almost certain to cause destabilizing upheavals in the =
Middle East which could threaten the global community. More ominously, =
the CIA and FBI have reported that a war in Iraq will definitely lead to =
terrorist attacks in America and a number of European nations, including =
Britain. This matter must now be framed in a new light. Does the British =
government believe it acceptable to assist the United States in going to =
war on the word of a graduate student from Monterey?=20
>=20
>The revelation of this data could conceivably come to do significant =
harm to the Bush administration's attempt to assemble a "Coalition of =
the Willing" for an attack upon Iraq. Tony Blair and Britain have been, =
since the beginning, the most fundamentally important members of =
whatever international coalition Mr. Bush is able to assemble.=20
>=20
>This report could shake Blair's standing with his government and his =
people. Blair's relationship with his own party, and with the British =
citizenry, has already proven rocky on the subject of his alliance with =
the Bush administration over this conflict. If Blair's ability to stand =
with Mr. Bush becomes undermined, Mr. Bush would find himself almost =
completely isolated on this issue.=20

re: contact info for Vernon Frazer and Gwyn McVay? Gwyn McVay is the author
of "brother ikon" (inkstone press) and "This Natural History" (Pecan Grove).
She may or may not sport a tattoo of a black bird. This is the only
identifying information I have on this mysterious but very glamorous author
at present. Please help me find her as I am desperate for reasons I could
not possibly reveal on this list. It may help in your search for contact
info about her to check out her home page with her photo at
http://patriot.net/~gmcvay/ I know that Vernon Frazer (a.k.a. Burnin'
Vernon) is the author of two works on a recently released issue of a very
difficult to locate on-line magazine curiously called m.a.g.
(www.muse-apprentice-guild.com). These  TWO WORKS

are titled

Once you understand how much this enigmatic and hard to locate poet knows or
once knew about celebrity stalking and how it is done you will understand
why someone might desperately need to have contact information about him!
Thanks in advance for this extremely urgent contact info help on these two
very hard to locate writers!

The thought that Bush believes he is acting morally is very disturbing. A
Labor frontbencher here (in Australia) recently described him as "the most
incompetent and dangerous President in living memory" - if we add SINCERE to
the equation, it gets really scary.

FYI --

As I just finished teaching two semesters on research techniques and
plagiarism, something about this seemed fishy.  There are some serious
problems with the "sources" of the article below:

1)  Can't find any Associated Press report that quotes "Ibrahim al-Marashi"
2)  Can't find any article authored by "Ibrahim al-Marashi" in the Middle
East Review of International Affairs
3)  Can't find ANY reporting of this article through Google's News search
4)  Although Jill Lawless is a reporter for the Associated Press, I can't
find any article about this (though she has written about Doris K. Goodwin's
plagiarism)
5)  I find it hard to believe that a respected journal like MERIA allowed
"spelling and grammar errors"

Looks bogus to me...Anyone?

>
>The veracity of Colin Powell's report on Wednesday before the United
Nations Security Council was dealt a serious blow when Britain's Channel 4
News broke a story that severely undermines the credibility of the
intelligence Powell used to make his case to the UN.
>
>Powell's presentation relied in no small part upon an intelligence dossier
prepared by the British Government entitled, "Iraq - Its Infrastructure of
Concealment, Deception and Intimidation." That report plagiarized large
swaths of an essay written in September of 2002 by a graduate student from
California named Ibrahim al-Marashi. Al-Marashi's essay appeared in the
September 2002 edition of a small journal, the Middle East Review of
International Affairs.
>
>According to the story from Channel 4 News, which was later augmented by an
Associated Press report by Jill Lawless, the duplicate text was first
spotted by a Cambridge, England academic named James Ranwala. Apparently,
Ranwala read the British dossier when it became available and believed he
had seen it before. As it turns out, he was correct. Entire sections of the
al-Marashi essay, including six full paragraphs in one section, had been cut
and pasted into the British dossier, including several spelling and
grammatical errors that are identical.
>
>According to the Associated Press, al-Marashi had no idea his paper was
being used by the British. "It was a shock to me," he told the Associated
Press, and expressed the hope that the British would credit his work "out of
academic decency."

>A line-by-line comparison of the two documents clearly shows one example of
the plagiarism:

>"Saddam appointed, Sabir 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri as head during the 1991 Gulf
War. After the Gulf War he was replaced by Wafiq Jasim al-Samarrai.

al-Askariyya in early 1992 then in late 1992 Fanar Zibin Hassan al-Tikriti
was appointed to this post.

security positions. By constantly shifting the directors of these agencies,
no one can establish a base in a security organisation for a substantial
period of time. No one becomes powerful enough to challenge the President."

>From the al-Marashi essay -
>
>"Saddam appointed, Sabir 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri(80) as head of Military
Intelligence during the 1991 Gulf War.(81) After the Gulf War he was
replaced by Wafiq Jasim al-Samarrai.(82)
>
>After Samarrai, Muhammad Nimah al-Tikriti(83) headed Military Intelligence
in early 1992(84) then in late 1992 Fanar Zibin Hassan al-Tikriti was
appointed to this post.(85) While Fanar is from Tikrit, both Sabir al-Duri
and Samarrai are non-Tikriti Sunni Muslims, as their last names suggest.
>
>Another source indicates that Samarrai was replaced by Khalid Salih
al-Juburi,(86) demonstrating how another non-Tikriti, but from the tribal
alliance that traditionally support the regime holds top security positions
in Iraq.(87)
>
>These shifting appointments are part of Saddam's policy of balancing
security positions between Tikritis and non-Tikritis, in the belief that the
two factions would not unite to overthrow him. Not only that, but by
constantly shifting the directors of these agencies, no one can establish a
base in a security organization for a substantial period of time, that would
challenge the President.(88)"
>
>After a close analysis of the identical text from both reports, it is also
clear that Britain altered key words to give their report a more sinister
and ominous twist. The British report states that the Iraqi intelligence
agency is "spying on foreign embassies in Iraq." The al-Marashi essay's
version states that the Iraqi intelligence agency is "monitoring foreign
embassies in Iraq." The rhetorical leap from "monitoring" to "spying" is
evident.
>
>In another portion of the British dossier, Iraq is accused of "supporting
terrorist organizations in hostile regimes." The al-Marashi essay's version
states that Iraq is "aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes." The
insertion of the word "terrorist" is manifestly provocative.
>
>A disturbing series of questions is raised by this matter. Mr. Powell
relied heavily upon "facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence,"
often from foreign intelligence services such as the British. His
presentation was meant not only to establish the fact that Iraq is in
possession of prohibited weapons, but also that Iraq enjoys ties to
terrorist groups like al Qaeda. In light of this data, the factual basis for
these claims is in doubt. Britain's report was touted as an up-to-the-minute
intelligence review of the situation in Iraq. In fact, much of it is based
upon the work of a graduate student who published his essay five months ago.
>
>Furthermore, if the al-Marashi essay was worthy of plagiarizing, why did
the British feel it necessary to alter certain key phrases so as to make it
seem that Iraq is spying on foreign embassies and aiding terrorist groups?
The manipulation of the original data appears, on the surface, to have been
done in bad faith.
>
>An analysis of the footnotes for the al-Marashi essay clearly demonstrate
that his work was meant to describe Iraq's intelligence apparatus and
military situation in the 1990s. The British dossier was presented as an
up-to-date report on the status of Iraq's weapons and terrorist ties. There
are 106 reference footnotes in the essay. 103 of these footnotes reference
reports and articles from 1988 to 2000. Only three are from this century,
and all of them reference reports from 2001. This is not current data in any
context.
>
>Clearly, Mr. Powell cannot be held responsible for the veracity of data
given to him by the British government. The fact remains, however, that the
British intelligence data, which comes from the most steadfast ally of the
Bush administration, has been severely undermined by this report. This calls
into question the veracity of virtually every aspect of Powell's
presentation to the United Nations.
>
>If the American Secretary of State was given such shoddily-assembled data
from its most loyal ally, how can the rest of the data be considered
dependable? The data on Zarqawi and Ansar al-Islam came from Jordanian
intelligence, a source much less trustworthy than the British. Many of the
"human sources" cited by Powell were, in fact, detainees in Guantanamo,
Cuba. These sources are suspect at best, yet were a significant part of the
basis for Powell's accusations that Iraq is working with al Qaeda and
developing a wide variety of prohibited weapons. Between these sources and
the unreliable data from the British, it seems all too clear that Powell's
entire presentation was based upon information that is questionable to say
the least.
>
>Finally, and most significantly, is the question of intent. The United
States will have soon placed approximately 150,000 troops in the region
surrounding Iraq with the full intention of going to war. Such a conflict is
almost certain to cause destabilizing upheavals in the Middle East which
could threaten the global community. More ominously, the CIA and FBI have
reported that a war in Iraq will definitely lead to terrorist attacks in
America and a number of European nations, including Britain. This matter
must now be framed in a new light. Does the British government believe it
acceptable to assist the United States in going to war on the word of a
graduate student from Monterey?
>
>The revelation of this data could conceivably come to do significant harm
to the Bush administration's attempt to assemble a "Coalition of the
Willing" for an attack upon Iraq. Tony Blair and Britain have been, since
the beginning, the most fundamentally important members of whatever
international coalition Mr. Bush is able to assemble.
>
>This report could shake Blair's standing with his government and his
people. Blair's relationship with his own party, and with the British
citizenry, has already proven rocky on the subject of his alliance with the
Bush administration over this conflict. If Blair's ability to stand with Mr.
Bush becomes undermined, Mr. Bush would find himself almost completely
isolated on this issue.

Over the past several months I have been corresponding with a young Iranian
poet, Payam Fotouhiyehpour. He has alerted me to several interesting web
sites for Persian poetry (in English), which I thought would be of general
interest to the list:

Persian classic  literature:
http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks
Rumi, Ferdowsi, Jami, Saadi and the Attar in English in full-text e-book
format, from Aimes, Iowa

Modern Persian poetry:
http://www.art-arena.com/Poetry.htm

Offical website of Ahmad Shamlu:
http://www.shamloo.com/
"He is more than a poet for Iran. He is a national (not governmental) poet
in Iran. For us like Neruda for Chilie or Lorca for Spain," Fotouhiyehpour
tells me.

Forugh Farrokhzad's Open Forum Web Site:
http://www.forughfarrokhzad.org/aboutus.htm
 From the website intro: "An extremely small number of Iranian women have
achieved anything in Iran outside of the home without dependence upon a
relationship with a man or male patronage. The best known among them is the
poet Forugh Farrokhzad (1935-1967), the most famous woman in the history of
Persian literature." The site appears to originate in San Diego.

Fotouhiyehpour himself has a blog, in Persian of course:
http://payamfotouhiyehpour.persianblog.com/
I asked if I might mention this and he noted that it would not be of much
use, given the language barrier. He also said he was going to put up a link
to the Poetics List.

Below is a forward with the information pertaining to the National Day of
Poetry and Poets Against the War....here is what is going on in DC. Hope to
see those in this area here!

best,

Dear Fellow Poets and Concerned Poetry Lovers,


We are writing to invite you to a Poetry Reading as part of the National Day
of Poetry Against the War, Wednesday, February 12, 2003, 7:OO PM. The reading
will be held at All Souls Church Unitarian, 16th & Harvard Streets, NW,
Washington DC, near the Columbia Heights Metro. You are invited to read one
poem - your own or someone else's - in the spirit of dissent. If you wish to
read please arrive at 6:30 PM to sign up.


The National Day of Poetry Against the War was called by poet and Copper
Canyon Press director Sam Hamill when First Lady Laura Bush invited poets
from all over the country to celebrate the poetry of Langston Hughes, Walt
Whitman, and Emily Dickinson at the White House on February 12. Hamill
decided he would use the occasion to voice his opposition to the
administration's drive to war with Iraq. He called for the date to be a
National Day of Poetry Against the War and invited poets to send him poems of
resistance to compile and present to the White House on that day.


Hamill was immediately flooded with poems and has now received over 3,600
poems and statements. The First Lady subsequently postponed the White House
gathering, so poets have organized their own events all over the country to
voice their opposition to the war. The DC event will be held in Columbia
Heights in the heart of the District at a church with a long tradition of
working for peace and social justice.


Pierce Hall is wheelchair accessible and the church is a short walk from the
Columbia Heights Metro. The event is free, although we will be asking for
freewill offerings to help defray the church's expenses for the evening.
Refreshments will be served. For more information, contact Sarah Browning at
202-986-4533 or browning@womenarts.org.


Below is the text of the letter from Sam Hamill, calling for the National Day
of Poetry Against the War. See also the website:
http://www.poetsagainstthewar.org


Dear Friends and Fellow Poets:


When I picked up my mail and saw the letter marked "The White House," I felt
no joy. Rather I was overcome by a kind of nausea as I read the card
enclosed:


Laura Bush requests the pleasure of your company
at a reception and White House Symposium
on "Poetry and the American Voice"
on Wednesday, February 12, 2003 at one o'clock


Only the day before I had read a lengthy report on the President's proposed
"Shock and Awe" attack on Iraq, calling for saturation bombing that would be
like the firebombing of Dresden or Tokyo, killing countless innocent
civilians.


I believe the only legitimate response to such a morally bankrupt and
unconscionable idea is to reconstitute a Poets Against the War movement like
the one organized to speak out against the war in Vietnam.


I am asking every poet to speak up for the conscience of our country and lend
his or her name to our petition against this war, and to make February 12 a
day of Poetry Against the War. We will compile an anthology of protest to be
presented to the White House on that afternoon.


There is little time to organize and compile. I urge you to pass along this
letter to any poets you know. Please join me in making February 12 a day when
the White House can truly hear the voices of American poets.

Sam Hamill

Interesting.  Might have to save this for future lessons on plagiarism.

Mark has some good points here. While we're phoning, writing, marching
against this war, let's not forget to look ahead to getting Bush out of
there. We might not be able to stop this invasion, but we might be able to
prevent many more bright ideas this gang are bound to come up with.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Here in New York City, we're going on with our lives but
being more watchful. We watch CNN to get the day's news,
and we also read the crawl--just in case. And, when a sentence
on the crawl is interrupted for commercial messages, we call the
network to see how it ends.

We take the stairs down instead of the elevator--just in case.
And we lay in an extra gallon or two of water, not to mention
some extra batteries (AAAs, AAs, and Ds). Since the last
alert we've purchased battery-powered radios so that we will
not be "in the dark" if the power goes out.

We keep a closer eye on our neighbors, and on the delivery men
who bring pizzas and Chinese food to their doors. Of course,
we still rely on the security men downstairs to screen those who
make their way up from the ground floor.

On our way to the stairs, we press our ears to our neighbors'
doors, just in case they're cooking anything up that we ought
to know about. On the streets, we give a wide berth to heaps
of trash and garbage, and to abandoned strange-looking parcels.
We also cross the street to avoid dogs or dog-walkers who
might be suicide bombers.

At the market (and we're beginning to avoid markets where
folks speak something other than English), we purchase what
we need (fruits and vegetables and other staples) and leave
quickly, trying to vary the stores and markets we shop at, so
as not to have too predictable a routine. We're de-routinizing,
so to speak.

Back at home, one of us watches neighboring buildings (and
other apartments in our own building) with binoculars while
the other watches the news and reads the crawl. We take turns.

Here in New York, life goes on. But more watchfully.

Hal

Dear Nick

Thank you for bringing Gwynn McVay's and my tragic plight to the attention
of the List's subscribers. While acknowledging that Gwynn McVay is certainly
more mysterious and glamorous than I am, regardless of whatever tattoo she
may or may not wear, I too have a need to be easier to locate, if not less
enigmatic. If people cannot locate my work, such as the poem and story you
mentioned, not to mention my new books, I might be forced to prostitute
myself to write a best-selling book such as HOW TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL
CELEBRITY STALKER.

If anybody finds any contact info on me, I would appreciate receiving it as
well. Sometimes I feel very lost when I wake up in the morning.

With Extreme* Gratitude,

"Burnin' Vernon" Frazer

*Gestures of extreme gratitude will take place in a wire cage. Spectators
can bet on the outcome.

Did you forget that we never voted him in? As you say, much more than
another war, in a long line of wars, is at stake here. Whether or not we
emerge from this administration with anything that resembles a democracy is
what's really in question. Besides being anti-war, one needs to be
pro-constitution.

Are you frustrated by pluralism? Does contemplating
viewpoints other than your own wear you out? Tired of
strange accents, weird religions and political ideas
that just don't jibe with yours? Well, your worries
are over, because now there's Oil War!
         Just plug Oil War into any standard telephone jack
and get whisked away by the soothing screams of
(insert current evil)'s women and children expiring
like so many  out-of-date snacks in the fires of
long-range retribution! In minutes Oil War will
instantly dissolve unsightly anti-American sentiment,
leaving your world capitalist, passive, white and
Christian! And Oil War won't stain Judeo-Christian
skin!
        Men! Oil War is formulated with a special proprietary
blend of synthetic herbals and shrinking 401K's
guarenteed to turn your kitten into a raging tigress
when the lights go out! Oil War is 100% American-made,
with no migrant worker ingredients, no Federal Labor
Law and no Minimum Wage! Just apply Oil War to
uncooperative, sovereign regions, and in no time at
all Oil War will turn stubborn radical fundamentalists
into docile over-weight myopic consumers!
        Ladies! Oil War is non-toxic, which means you'll
never have to remember the tactics your country used
during the Cold War Soviet occupation of Afghanistan,
the Civil Rights movement, Amadou Diallo, and May 4th
at Kent State! Oil War's patented ingredients were
formulated by high level government scientists. One
dose of Oil War and you'll agree, it really IS The
Final Solution! Order Today!

I make an input movie clip
and an output movie clip.
I wake up. They are draggable.

They could go anywhere. I am
on the screen. My head hurts and
I'm reading what Bruce Andrews
has discovered that he doesn't know

about "cyberpoetry," as defined
by three people. It's all constrained!

She sleeps in a hull all night, licking
dreams from the backs of her hands.
I trace these bitmaps I found

in a Google image search on the word
"covered." I adjust the vectors. I script
the clip to load these backgrounds
randomly. My headache is different

moment to moment; she sleeps in a husk
while harvest waits beneath a skin
of cold crystals. I mimic a Windows

interface. I make coffee. I
look out on a weather thoughtlessly
turning;  spilled milk shadows, slow
water licking the banks between ice

and flaw. My head brims with salt.
She wakes up with a bloom.

[the list limit gave me a chance to rethink this before sending which I did
because it does reveal a certain amount of bitterness and self interest and
it's certainly not the profound balm these times seem to evoke nor is it a
politically correct admonition to hold the political line or poetic sentence
tight.  But then poets can't effect anything so I guess it's just a poem]

As the stolid poetry publishing world may change some day I'd be interested
in thoughts on a poetry career.  Even though there is a new web-based A-Gish
venture that crops up almost daily my impression is web-based has pretty
much settled into imitatoprint channels at present, so the tabloid here
intrigues me as a format.    As a careerist would publication in a local big
city paper, a local smaller city paper, a local tabloid, a trade union
workers' rag, 100 poetsagainstthewar, or? get me more bang for the buck so
to speak?

The Poet’s Theater Jamboree ended here in San Francisco last night with
the proverbial bang.  Thanks to all you hard-working souls at SPT for
putting it together!  It’s one of those alchemical events that
transmutes a scene into a community.  Highlights from where I was
sitting included:

---Eileen Tabios’ mesmerizing and squirm-inducing (geez, maybe I *am*
bourgeois!) But Seriously, When I Was Jasper Johns’ Filipino Lover . . .

---Elizabeth Treadwell’s La Gnossiene, a dreamy, acerbic fantasy that
puts Djuna Barnes, Aphra Behn, Jean Rhys and Gertrude Stein (replete
with lapdog) in the same room.  This is one I definitely want to study
more closely on the page.

---Kevin Killian and Clifford Hengst in drag—an event as semi-annual
around here as a Macy’s sale but twice as luscious.  Their performance
in Christopher Allegra and Brian Bauman’s Nu-Wave Bad Hair Day was a
coprophagous hoot.

--Taylor Brady in sling (he really did break his arm last week!) as Dick
Cheney—this had to be seen to be believed—in David Buuck’s musical farce
Hail, Guantanamo!  Favorite Dick line:  “Human rights?  No es possible.
Now pour, favor, a Cuba Libre.”  Cynthia Taylor’s as Conde Rice brought
down the house with an *amazing* singing voice.

Much more worth mentioning—Brent Cunningham’s terrific Theater of No
Feelings, Lauren Gudath’s talking cow, Mary Burger’s chilling video yada
yada yada.  Maybe someone else’ll take up the slack.  Okay, we didn’t
get the Olympics, but we’ve got the Jamboree to look forward to now
every year.

Kudos to Behrle for making it to 30 without self-immolating.

Hal: It occurred to me years ago that there had to be a strategic reason
why Islamic countries were settling so many of their citizens in New York
and establishing them in key industries. Now, on a command from Al Qaeda,
or Saddam, or whoever, every cab and every 24 hour convenience store in New
York could cease to operate on a moment's notice. The city would be brought
to its knees.

This probably came to me while I was trying to find a parking place in
front of my apartment at noon one day. There was a storefront mosque across
the street.

Yours in vigilance,

Mark

Forgive me for being on "High Alert",--but I'm after
all an Arab Male--am I missing the irony in these
posts?

*  KENNETH REXROTH'S Complete Poems was just published by Copper
Canyon Press, edited by Sam Hamill and Bradford Morrow.  Rexroth
(1905-1982) had a significant influence on, particularly, West Coast
writers and artists for decades and in several arenas-- as political
thinker, literary-cultural critic, newspaper columnist and radio
journalist, mentor and also nemesis to many younger writers.  This
free public celebration focuses on Rexroth's poetry, and is
co-sponsored by The Poetry Center, Copper Canyon Press, Poetry Flash,
the Western States Arts Federation, and the San Francisco Public
Library.

". . . he was America's--how else to say it?--great American poet.
=46or Rexroth, alone among the poets of this century, encompasses most
of what there is to love in this country: ghetto street-smartness,
the wilderness, populist anti-capitalism, jazz and rock & roll, the
Utopian communities, the small bands at the advance guard of the
various arts, the American language, and all the unmelted lumps in
the melting pot." --Eliot Weinberger

Note:  SF Main Public Library will also be hosting an exhibit of
Rexroth materials on their premises, 6th Floor of the Library, thru
=46ebruary 20.

as a one-time Christian who is still male but over 30 i probably will wake
on high alert on Monday unless Bush changes his plans to appear at the
Christian publishers' conference even though Copper Canyon doesn't belong to
this artistic clique and the 101st will be shipping out.

with luck i'll arise and walk to where the local shopkeep has camels waiting
for cents less than at the big chain like his father carefully pointed out
to me on his new computer even though he had trouble bringing up and using
the calculator.

it is odd that there are not 100 librarians against the war, my brother is
trying to calm our brothers in CO, and people continue to believe INITial
INITiated INTELigence reports and pillpopping pilots continue to keep us
safe?

Information I promised to a lot of you about our writers conference, set to
take place at the same time as the AWP. The venues are within half a mile of
the Harborplace Renaissance Hotel, where the AWP is taking place. We'll have
punk shows, panels, readings, and a lot of performance art, or pranks,
depending on how you look at them. Hope to see a lot of you there. And if
you have any more questions, you can send them to me or check out the web
site: www.dissociatedwritersproject.com

2/8/03
The DWP is a collective of writers, performance artists, painters,
magicians, comic book artists, comedians, plastic surgeons, screenwriters,
tattoo artists, English gentlemen, and others, meeting in Baltimore for the
purpose of exchanging ideas about literature. We’re not getting together to
talk about our preferences for one dogma over another, or anything like
that, but merely to provide a forum for discussing an array of aesthetic
choices.

At its core, the DWP isn’t interested in any presiding literary movement,
which is why we’re offering up for consideration the inclusion of forms of
expression traditionally left out of serious consideration in the conference
format. We’re too uneducated, I guess, to know what it means to write within
a literary movement, or what it means to write anything that isn’t true to
itself before being true to an idea. So we
think the DWP is bound to be a success. We have no regard for custom and no
interest in an absolute, predetermined goal. Which means that no matter
what, the final product will be perfect, because it won’t
be at all what we’re expecting.

Panel discussions will include “Is Bad Literature Good?/Is Good Literature
Bad?,”  wrestling (mud and otherwise), and something on Surrealism. Readers
will include among others the winners of our fiction and poetry contests
(see contest info online; we’re spreading the news around the country).

Here is our schedule:
Thurs., February 27 @ The 14 Carat Cabaret:
“Surrealism” panel
fiction and poetry reading
punk show: Thee Snuff Project

Fri., February 28 @ To Be Announced:
“Is Bad Writing Good?/Is Good Writing Bad?”
fiction and poetry reading
lounge show: The P. Oranges

Sat., March 1 @ The Sidebar
“The Future of Aesthetics” panel
short story/poetry contest winners’ reading
punk show: The Black Eyes

The Sidebar, a reputable Baltimore punk venue, and the 14 Carat Cabaret
Lounge aren’t the usual conference locations, and we really don’t care. We
want everyone in the community to attend. Our locations seat 100-200 people
and will probably be jam-packed with everyone imaginable, because we’ve
advertised everywhere, the more unusual the better. To be honest, we believe
that writing has an audience of everyone, and it’s too bad when nobody but
its practitioners are listening in. So we passed out hundreds of flyers at a
recent DC peace protest, sent e-mails to religious discussion groups, handed
out quarter-flyers to drop-
outs and geeks roaming the streets around Adams Morgan, DC, Astor Place, NY,
Golden Gate Park, Southey, Charles Village.

Also, anybody who wants to read at the conference will be considered. And no
writer at the conference has precedence. Each prospective reader and
panelist has to compete for time at the conference not on the basis
of credentials or accomplishments, but on the basis of the quality of the
work. Even the attending published writers, many that we respect and admire,
will have to walk through the same decision process.

Nothing about the DWP harks of anything we’ve ever seen before, which is why
we’re endlessly surprised about where we are. All we know is that everyone
in attendance has an enormous responsibility to contribute to the
discussion. We’re a renegade writing group with strong opinions, but this
doesn’t mean we’re going to run the show. Neither will the moderators or
readers be talking over a podium or over the heads of the crowd, but they’ll
be having beers with the audience, attending the conference on equal footing
with everyone else, because none of us had the answers before we came and
probably never will, but at least we all know enough to be trying something
different.

Hundreds of hours have gone into the planning of the DWP conference. For the
past month or so the organizers of the DWP have pretty much stopped writing
to plan. Which is amazing because the only thing that could ever get us to
stop writing is basically the end of the world. So, the end of the world is
here in a sense.

                                Thank You,
                                Brad Senning

A Song of Themselves

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/08/opinion/08GARM.html

By LEONARD GARMENT

Last week a group of American poets showed once again that artists can be
the worst enemies of the arts. Laura Bush, as part of her efforts to
encourage reading by honoring literature, had invited several poets to the
White House for a symposium. One of the invitees  perhaps channeling Eartha
Kitt, who lambasted Lady Bird Johnson about the Vietnam War at a White
House luncheon in 1968  decided to use the occasion to protest the
administration's Iraq policy. He solicited antiwar poems to present to Mrs.
Bush at the White House and posted them on a Web site.

One poet, Marilyn Hacker, offered this contribution: "while, claiming
they're `defending democracy,'/ our homespun junta exports the war machine/
. . . Jews who learned their comportment from storm troopers/ act out the
nightmares that woke their grandmothers." The White House canceled the
symposium. The poets expressed indignation that the administration was
stifling their freedom of speech.

The issue is not, of course, Iraq (about which I have my own
uncertainties). Nor is it about freedom of speech  these poets are free to
read their poems in their own forums, as many have said they will on
Wednesday, the day on which the symposium was to have taken place.

Rather, it is about bad behavior, the sort I have grown increasingly weary
of over the last 35 years. In the late 1960's, as a counsel in Richard
Nixon's White House, I was assigned to what I called (laughingly at first,
more seriously later) the "arts and riots" beat. I worked with the chairmen
of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the
Humanities to increase their budgets. Partly because Nixon was such an
unlikely arts advocate, the effort succeeded, perhaps too well.

As the endowments' budgets grew exponentially, so did the conflict between
politicians who disliked spending the government's money on the arts and
artists who disliked the idea that politics should have any role in
determining how public money should be spent. The results of this conflict
ranged from the irrational to the surreal. The arts endowment gave a grant
for an anthology that included a "visual poem" that read, in its entirety,
"lighght." (I always have trouble remembering exactly how many "gh's" it
had.) The award sent a Republican representative, William Scherle, into a
permanent orbit of anti-endowment outrage.

More seriously, as the Vietnam schism widened, Leonard Bernstein composed
the fierce antiwar opera "Mass." President Nixon declined to attend the
premiere, on Kennedy Center's opening night. Bernstein asked me to try to
change Nixon's mind, arguing quite seriously that if the president did not
attend, he would be impermissibly mixing art and politics.

More strange, the American Film Institute, newly established by Congress
and housed in the federally subsidized Kennedy Center, scheduled a showing
of the Costa-Gavras film "State of Siege," which treated with sympathy the
killing of an American hostage by leftist rebels in a Latin American
dictatorship. Knowing the film would be a boon to opponents of federal arts
financing, I asked the help of the institute's director, George Stevens Jr.
He canceled the showing, with the shrewd explanation that it was perhaps
less than appropriate to show a pro-assassination movie in a center named
after an assassinated president.

Still, the endowments kept their Congressional support through occasional
crises like these until 1990, when two events  an exhibition of homoerotic
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and a photograph by Andres Serrano of a
crucifix in the artist's urine  pushed them to the edge of extinction.

Congress appointed a commission, which I led along with John Brademas, a
former Democratic representative who had been the principal draftsman of
the legislation that created the arts and humanities endowments. Our
commission's unanimous report centered on a statement that in awarding
grants the endowments could, consistent with the Constitution, take into
account the country's diversity of sensibilities and beliefs. This
proposition was challenged by disappointed grant-seekers, but upheld when
the Supreme Court ruled against Karen Finley, she of the
chocolate-saturated performance pieces.

The recent incident, while more genteel than events past, threatens to
create the same kind of resentment and mistrust in places important to the
country's cultural life.

Here is a concrete example. One of the poems originally scheduled for the
White House was "A Dream Deferred" by Langston Hughes. The poem was to have
been sung by cast members of "Harlem Song," a musical showcase of Harlem
history that ran last year at the renovated Apollo Theater on 125th Street
and is scheduled to return this year.

This came about because, at the behest of the show's producer, I made
"Harlem Song" known to a friend at the White House, who then traveled to
New York to see the show. The invitation from Mrs. Bush followed. People
connected with the show were excited over the national exposure the
symposium would bring and the possibility that it might lead to an
invitation to present the entire show at the White House.

With or without the White House, "Harlem Song" will go on. But when the
symposium was canceled, the disappointment of people associated with the
show was distinct. So was mine: with colleagues in New York and Washington,
I have been working to build a museum of jazz, America's only indigenous
art form, in Harlem. The success of a show like "Harlem Song," and the
audiences it can attract uptown, are immensely valuable to the area. They
also deepen the profound relationship between the cultural and civic lives
of the city, which defines New York to the world.

Such relationships will thrive only if politicians and artists display
mutual restraint. Each party must refrain from gratuitously poking a finger
in the eye of the other, a principle that the protesting poets flouted.
They sought to use for political ends the platform that the White House
provided to them for their artistry. They showed no concern for the effect
of this on other artists and enterprises. Of course, they were exercising
their constitutional rights. But they should not be surprised that Mrs.
Bush, exercising her own rights, declined to offer them tea and cake. Let's
call it poetic justice and move on.

Leonard Garment, a lawyer, is president of the Jazz Museum in Harlem.

I am certain that Laura Bush could be more discriminating in the future
when she invites poets to the White House.  She can have the Dept of
Homeland Security check out poets' politics before she makes the
invitation.  That way the poets who "fit" her definition of politesse can
retain their invitations and even sign a pledge to keep art and politics
separate while the rest of the rabble is kept out of the august halls of
our government.  Maxine Chernoff

As for the organization Leonard Garment politics for here,  I'm sure she
can reinvite them for another occasion without making the mistake of
inviting poetics who happen  to have opinions beyond "craft" issues.

i just received a rejection notice for a piece i submitted to rhizome artbase.
it hurts.

the piece, a mid-life koala contemplates life II can be viewed at
http://users.bigpond.net.au/mangolegs/muriel/kom2.html


it is part of a collaborative piece.  muriel frega sent me, and three
others, the sequence of images of two figures dancing, computer generated,
young male and female.
my response, which is with all the other pieces is at the url,
http://murielfrega.netfirms.com/dco.htm

the work uses traditional animation, computer animation, performance
poetry, computer voices, flash animation and navigation and gif animation.
it is a cyberpoem as a whole, made up of many elements, user input
determining the temporal engagement of the user.

the work speaks of middle age sexuality and the stereotyped media
constructions of 'sexy' and 'desirable' as being young, trim, heterosexual
and good looking. the poem that appears as text and spoken by a female
computer voice celebrates sexuality in the language of the street, i
believe it is neither the phallo- or vagina-centric, maybe crude but
celebratory of the mutual pleasure of the participants. the viagara poem
says that chemicals are no substitution to emotional needs. these thoughts
are all tied together as dream sequences of the central character, a
mid-life koala.

or is middle age male sexuality a thing we shouldn't be questioning or
exploring in our art?

i would be interested to hear women's and men's responses to the piece.

DEAR POETS

To encourage poetic disruption in the militant logosphere, I'm forwarding
this modest action we've arranged here in Buffalo (friend and colleague
Sarah Campbell came up with the idea).

Feel free to borrow and implement in your own spheres.  In return, if you
have other ideas or have heard of any, PLEASE EMAIL THEM to
jskinner@buffalo.edu  I am compiling a catalog of poetry-action experiments
(along the lines of Bernadette Mayer's Writing Experiments or Darren
Wershler-Henry's Tapeworm Foundry) to disseminate as widely as possible.

http://www.poetryproject.com/features/mayer.html#exper
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/wershler_tapeworm.html

The predictable model of "anti-war poetry," to rally the faithful or "speak
truth to power," clearly has limitations in today's context, as does the
"language" model of disruptive, reflective and/or expressive writings
politely circulated amongst a company, however vital, of poets and critics.

These are both valuable approaches, not to be overlooked, but the moment
calls for practices reaching, in form as well as content, beyond what (and
whom) we already know.  (Poetry world infighting or the time-consuming
business of critical and theoretical debate, though perhaps useful in the
long run, are mainly a drag RIGHT NOW on limited resources.)  A list of
merely potential, even absurd practices (a la Wershler-Henry) could have
great generative consequences.

It might be poetry's particular contribution, furthermore, to disrupt
right-step, left-step reflexes with a productive confusion or a brutal
clarity, to electrify and awaken precisely the imaginative responses, the
historical and foundational questioning that are the first victims of our
administration's rush to war.

Now more than ever the world needs our variously defined intensively
activated IMAGINATIONS.

Makings that extend into whatever (im)mediate environment, not just that of
speech and writing, are of interest: the only suggestions NOT welcome are
those of a violent, destructive nature.  The emphasis, to rescue a sadly
trivialized category, is CREATIVE (including, of course, the
creative-critical).  Oblique as much as direct, both private and public
actions are welcome.

Need I add that there is nothing proprietary to this catalog.  In the
interests of urgency it will be circulated, plagiarized and propagated, as
widely as possible (and inevitably transformed and expanded).  Copyrighted
poets need not apply.  A list of contributors will be appended-- anonymous
suggestions are fine too.

If you have a poetry action to contribute, please send it NOW, as there is
little time to lose.  (Please indicate POETRY ACTION in the email subject
heading, and send your suggestion in the body of the email rather than by
attachment.)  All contributors will receive an electronic copy of the
catalog, to be further disseminated, once it is compiled.  And thanks in
advance!

a public reading / demonstration
Friday, February 14th at noon

SUNY at Buffalo's Student Union, North Campus
2nd Floor Social Hall (above lobby)

"For to oppose evil men is the chief aim we set before ourselves"
--from Boethius's _The Consolation of Philosophy_, which he wrote in prison
awaiting execution for "treason" against the reigning king Theodoric.

A public reading as demonstration of opposition to Bush's intended war on
Iraq.  The reading will be compiled and read by participants and will
describe the lives of people who have set before themselves as their chief
aim the opposition of evil.

    * * *

Please consider participating in this event which is part of
"Teach-Ins At College Campuses Throughout New York State" week,
being organized by people at Cornell University (Feb. 10-14, 2003).

The time this event requires is minimal, and the efficacy of it will be
boosted by the participation of many, so please consider joining in.

Here are details on how you can participate:

PREPARATION

Participants choose a person or group who has set him / her / themselves
in opposition to _______ (you may fill in the blank and go as far back in
time as you like) using non-violent means.  Each participant writes 20
sentences of fact about the person / group--these sentences may concern any
fact of the person / group's life: significant, mundane, representative,
detailed, general, whatever; each sentence should contain the name of
the person / group; and the person / group does not have to be famous.

PUBLIC READING

Participants read one sentence at a time so that each person passes the
microphone, reads one sentence, the next person reads a sentence, and so
on moving readers past the microphone and returning again for the next
sentence; thus the Catalog becomes a mingled compendium of oppositions,
in the round.

    * * *

If you'd like to participate, please send an email including your name to:
skc3@acsu.buffalo.edu, and then:

1) select your person / group and write twenty sentences about them and

2) come and read those sentences at the event

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

My Composition in Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not.

Nothing is relevant to the world.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism).

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism.

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate.

An effect already exhausts.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.'

My Composition2 in Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not.
It is entirely relevant to us.

Nothing is relevant to the world.
The world would not exist without us.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self. Existential statements procure the world in relation to our
perception.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world. The world transforms with each and
every utterance.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world. There is no 'world,' only
a confluence of interrelated protocols and effects.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism). Pointing-out symbolizes the
recognition which takes place all the way back, beginning with retinal
learning; the pointing-out is a consensus or coherency for others, for
community.

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism. Consciousness
defines and procures thought.

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this. It is entirely beyond this, beyond
this and others, beyond community and communality.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.
Consciousness is a priori and comes with the first imminence of the world.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.
Consciousness declares everything, internal or external to language.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.
Declaration is always prior to language; gesture cleaves thought itself,
the psychogeographical substrate of the world.

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate. Inscriptions
are contiguous to the substrate at best.

An effect already exhausts. An effect is always new; nothing repeats.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates. Language is build on the predication of the dialect
between body and environment; culture creates, and language follows.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.
Words are everything; every utterance is an active performative. The world
becomes comprehension and comprehends through language.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language. Language
comforts and transforms house into home; identity is situated in language,
just as alarum is subdued.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves. We speak only to others. We
speak only for them. This is the erotic gesture of culture.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.' We always speak;
language always employs the other as our master.

The self-reflexivity of language is the routing of resonance; all objects
and cultures are resonant holdfasts for our existence. Nothing depends on
language, which derails the resonance of the world.

Neither objects nor cultures exist. Objects and cultures exist in spite of
ourselves, others, and the symbolic resolution of language.

"The cornered vessel (ku) has no longer corners. What a 'cornered' vessel!
What a 'cornered' vessel!" (Confucius)

The ku has never existed. The ku has always existed; it is Confucius who
has disappeared.

Language infiltrates speaker, spoken, and spoken-to with its semantic
skein. Likewise, the skein does not exist. Language deludes the speaking
of the body; the skein of culture exists a priori to language. The sememe
itself is a priori.

Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are correlated actions in the world.
Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are mutually incoherent; they signify
the breaking of the world, the tendency towards dissolution. What they
hold, is released; what they confine, is loosened.

They have no relevance. They are relevant; it is their byproduct and
phenomenology, their glance, that describes everything.

The correlation is nearly decomposable. Every speaking is a composition.
Every composition is an appearance. Every appearance is an illusion.
The correlation falls to pieces. Every speaking breaks with self, world,
and others. Every breaking is immeasurable. Every breaking alludes.

Illusions are subject to entropy and dissolution. Neither the appearance
nor the illusion exists. What does not exist, disseminates, dissembles,
dissimulates. Speaking is subject to joining. Speaking, by measure of its
breaking, is substrate to appearance. What disseminates, dissembles,
dissimulates, returns, assembles, seminates, within the broken of
language.

Our existence is an illusion. Our existence is the only real.

The world is neither an illusion nor a copula. The world is all that is
neither an illusion nor a copula. The world coheres through the breaking
of the copula.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world is nothing. Everything is
relevant; the world is everything. The relevance of the world is the
beginning of politics.

My Last Composition of Language


It is entirely irrelevant to the world whether we exist or not. It is
entirely relevant to us. It is irrelevant to us whether we exist or not;
that is the truth to be learned.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world would not exist without us.
We would not exist without the world; we do not exist.

Existential statements serve an evolutionary purpose, the reification of
the self. Existential statements procure the world in relation to our
perception. Existential statements are a priori errors in relation to the
world. They disguise our truth and the truth of the world.

What occurs in language in relation to the copula or self-reflexivity, has
no effect whatsoever on the world. The world transforms with each and
every utterance. There is neither transformation nor non-transformation.
The world is an illusion of its truth.

Nothing has any effect whatsoever on the world. There is no 'world,' only
a confluence of interrelated protocols and effects. There is world and
non-world; we are ghosts looking in at the world; we are ghosts looking at
ourselves. To eliminate perception of ourselves and the world is the truth
of ourselves and the world. To see ourselves by not-seeing ourselves as
ghosts, that is the truth of the world.

Self-reflexive recognition is a form of pointing-out or gesture, in the
guise of naming (by virtue of nominalism). Pointing-out symbolizes the
recognition which takes place all the way back, beginning with retinal
learning; the pointing-out is a consensus or coherency for others, for
community. Pointing out collapses the world, just as nourishment and sleep
collapses the world. To eliminate the learning before language, to
eliminate language, that is the truth of the world.

Consciousness, self-consciousness, is a defense mechanism. Consciousness
defines and procures thought. Consciousness and self-conscious break in
relation to the world; through the broken, light emerges, that is the
truth of the world.

There is nothing to 'it' beyond this. 'It' is entirely beyond this, beyond
this and others, beyond community and communality. 'It' is already an
error of perception; forget 'it' and the truth of the world emerges.

It is a mistake to assume that consciousness exists outside of language.
Consciousness is a priori and comes with the first imminence of the world.
Immanence is neither of consciousness nor the world; nor is immanence of
language or the a prior, that is the truth of the world.

It resides in language; it is a tool which occupies or declares nothing.
Consciousness declares everything, internal or external to language. There
is nothing to declare, nothing to emerge. Declaration is false existence,
non-declaration is false existence.

Declaration occurs only in language. Physical gesture cleaves the air.
Declaration is always prior to language; gesture cleaves thought itself,
the psychogeographical substrate of the world. Declaration occurs
everywhere among gestures. Gestures declare; the world emerges without
declaration, that is the truth of the world.

Inscriptions transform the imminent world of the substrate. Inscriptions
are contiguous to the substrate at best. Inscriptions are the substrate
which must be comprehended to be forgotten; that is the emergence of the
world.

An effect already exhausts. An effect is always new; nothing repeats. An
effect has no being, no relevance, that is the truth of the world.

Culture is built on the predication that language means, and therefore
acts and creates. Language is build on the predication of the dialectic
between body and environment; culture creates, and language follows.
Following or leading make no difference; what goes before, goes behind.

Words are nothing and do nothing. The performative is a contextual myth.
Words are everything; every utterance is an active performative. The world
becomes comprehension and comprehends through language. The becoming of
the world is not the world, and the comprehension of the world is not the
comprehension of the world. Everything and nothing are nothing and
everything, that is the truth of the world.

Alarum is spread by language, just as identity precedes language. Language
comforts and transforms house into home; identity is situated in language,
just as alarum is subdued. Alarum for what, alarum hinders, ties one to
oneself, to the languaging and things of the world. Alarum ties one to
identity, identity ties one to language, to the world. Break identity and
alarum, that is the truth of the world.

"In its early stages the ballet also yielded ornaments which moved kaleid-
oscopically, But even after they had discarded their ritual meaning, they
remained still the plastic formation of the erotic life which gave rise to
them and determined their traits." (Kracauer)

We speak to ourselves. We speak for ourselves. We speak only to others. We
speak only for them. This is the erotic gesture of culture. Speaking and
eroticism tie one to broken meaning, taken for the meaning of truth, for
the truth of meaning. Break what is already broken, that is the truth of
the world. Do not break what is already broken, that is the truth of the
world.

We never speak. Language has never been 'employed.' We always speak;
language always employs the other as our master. Speaking negates the
world; speaking is always busy. In silence is the world's truth, after
employment and non-employment.

The self-reflexivity of language is the routing of resonance; all objects
and cultures are resonant holdfasts for our existence. Nothing depends on
language, which derails the resonance of the world. Dependency and
resonance, already an investment; eliminate dependency and resonance,
eliminate investment, that is the truth of the world.

Neither objects nor cultures exist. Objects and cultures exist in spite of
ourselves, others, and the symbolic resolution of language. More
hindrance! more hindrance!

"The cornered vessel (ku) has no longer corners. What a 'cornered' vessel!
What a 'cornered' vessel!" (Confucius)

The ku has never existed. The ku has always existed; it is Confucius who
has disappeared. Confucius exists and does not exist; the ku exists and
does not exist. So many objects! Forget existence and non-existence, that
is the truth of the world.

Language infiltrates speaker, spoken, and spoken-to with its semantic
skein. Likewise, the skein does not exist. Language deludes the speaking
of the body; the skein of culture exists a priori to language. The sememe
itself is a priori. Skein and sememe, all these structures; what else
emerges? What emerges, does not emerge; what does not emerge, emerges.
Forget emerging, in silence, that is the truth of the world.

Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are correlated actions in the world.
Speaking, spoken, and spoken-to, are mutually incoherent; they signify the
breaking of the world, the tendency towards dissolution. What they hold,
is released; what they confine, is loosened. Coherency is the skein of the
self; non-coherency is the skein of the world. Coherency and non-coherency
are joined by others and the spoken-to. The world fragments among the
assumption of contraries, divisions, typifications. Forget coherency; the
world coheres. Forget non-coherency; the world falls apart.

They have no relevance. They are relevant; it is their byproduct and
phenomenology, their glance, that describes everything. The description of
everything is the falsehood of the world; the truth of the world is
neither description nor non-description.

The correlation is nearly decomposable. Every speaking is a composition.
Every composition is an appearance. Every appearance is an illusion. The
correlation falls to pieces. Every speaking breaks with self, world, and
others. Every breaking is immeasurable. Every breaking alludes. Breaking
interferes; what is broken, has edges; what has edges, longs for
completion. Forget composition and decomposition; be a ghost! Illusion and
reality, all the same, that is the truth of the world.

Illusions are subject to entropy and dissolution. Neither the appearance
nor the illusion exists. What does not exist, disseminates, dissembles,
dissimulates. Speaking is subject to joining. Speaking, by measure of its
breaking, is substrate to appearance. What disseminates, dissembles, dis-
simulates, returns, assembles, seminates, within the broken of language.
Breaking and coming together, as of the spheres, that is nothing.
Semination and dissemination, that is nothing but the seduction of the
symbolic. Forget stasis and process, entropy and non-entropy, equilibrium
and non-equilibrium, they are naming, and naming is not the province of
ghosts. Be a ghost, that is the truth of the world.

Our existence is an illusion. Our existence is the only real. Our
existence is our non-existence; our illusion is our real; our real is our
illusion, our non-existence is our existence. Be a ghost, that is the
truth of the world.

The world is neither an illusion nor a copula. The world is all that is
neither an illusion nor a copula. The world coheres through the breaking
of the copula. There is no copula without division, a white horse is not a
horse, pairs never unite, that is the truth of the world.

Nothing is relevant to the world. The world is nothing. Everything is
relevant; the world is everything. The relevance of the world is the
beginning of politics. The beginning of politics is the end of politics;
the world is neither relevant nor irrelevant, nothing or everything. Be a
ghost! That is the truth of the world, be a ghost!

Hi Michael & all

That'd be Sweethearts, a very charming book published by Something
Else Press back in the 60s, I think.

Just one more book I've forgotten about after having a lot of boxes
in storage since we moved to Fort Worth a couple of years ago. We're
sorting through (& culling) music-related boxes now, I'm interested
in what the process will be like when we get to the literary boxes.

Hal:

Alan Sondheim is 218 years old. I first met him in 1843, just outside
Seattle. There was a knock on my door in the middle of the night. I opened
it,  and there stood a man mumbling something that now I know was a
primitive form of HTML. With him were ten emaciated slaves escaping from the
Microsoft campus, making a break to freedom in the south. I fed them, and
they disappeared into the rainy night, sparking a bit from what I believe
was electromagnetic fever. (EF) The next time I heard from Alan was in 1996.
I don't remember exactly where, but I must have been on the Net.

The world as conjurer
shows us what it can do. It
performs feat and stunts
we know are not possible
but, without guile, it rolls
up its sleeves, demonstrates
them out in front where
everyone can see & believe.
And we want so to believe;
after all, we've come here

It's small talk is part of its

It talks about war, economy,

My dog Midnight, a
black German Shepard,
at the reptile fair,

where scales are pornography,
runs

chromatic in a cobalt mode. The coin-slot
on my lizard terminal is loose (shoddy
work!) and something huge and scaly

slips out of its aquarium-cage.
Midnight catches it in her mouth

and swallows: scales:  peeling back to show
the poison-pink flesh. Midnight lays down;

she's sleeping still now, with no twitching
legs. The sky has her color tonight, and runs

minor chords across our heads.

I am both shocked and dismayed at the ageist ridicule this list is =
heaping on poor, old Alan Sondheim, arguably the grandfather of 21st =
century American literature. As I have in the past, I must once again =
step forward to defend him. This time, I am not defending his right to =
publish, but his right to live. If, at age 60,  as some allege, Alan is =
suffering symptoms of  serious age-related decline, it is imperative =
that we give him the contact information than he requests, again and =
again, so that it is always with him. I don't think any of us could bear =
the weight of the  responsibility for poor Alan wandering the streets of =
 Manhattan, mumbling to himself and to passersby, "I am John Grisham...I =
am John Grisham..."  or for his advanced consciousness deteriorating =
into the mundanity that would reduce him to writing a "New York Times =
Number One Bestseller" about a power-crazed President seeking to battle =
an Middle Eastern dictator to avenge his father's losing an election. If =
we don't help our friend and colleague, we will have only ourselves to =
blame for seeing him stumble onto late-night talk shows in a shocking =
state of wealth. I urge all of you to give Alan the information he needs =
to continue functioning in the way that we know he can. I urge you to =
stop your ridicule and show your full compassion and humanity to our =
good friend and colleague.

  Brandon Barr's astute comments about the value of listservs deserves to be
repeated and further discussed. Tom Bell wrote to me some time ago
suggesting that I write about my experiences on this list, as I have said
more than once here and many times to other friends socially that this list
is consistently a very valuable experience. I am encouraging every writer I
talk to to subscribe and contribute to the list, and I am trying to persuade
formerly active listservers to keep contributing. I also spoke to Joel Kuzai
about this recently at the Bowery Poetry Club. Joel Kuzai, well known to
subscribers to this list, is the author of "Poetics@" (Roof,1999), which
certainly should be required reading in any course on or systematic study of
listservs and blogging. I am fascinated by Barr's formulation and I imagine
there are also many other ways a listserv evolves, at least from my
admittedly limited experience. Brandon Barr's comment serves as food for
thought because I think the contentious aspects of the list, while being of
course problematic, are also very valuable because by trying to learn to
deal with them I've learned more about how to deal with important,
unavoidable and often necessary and ultimately sometimes beneficial
disagreements in the poetry community and elsewhere more openly and with
some kind of attempt, often admittedly clumsy, at humor. Every poet knows
that the poetry community, like any other, has its difficulties with
competition, manipulation and monopolizing. Then there is that continuously
troubling dynamic between a poet's invaluable idealism and the realities of
a poet's "career." Brandon Barr appears to be tracking and discussing on his
blog "texturl" -at http://texturl.net/-the rapidly developing phenomenon
that listservs and blogging are altering the media landscape in ways that
were unpredictable. The current political crisis now facing us is offering
an opportunity to to pinpoint the potential poltical power in the growing
synergetic relationship between listservs, blogging, poetry publications,
poetics, poets' published political opinions and commentary and the
interest and curiosity of other journalistic media. Commercial media are
like  predatory animals necessarily searching hungrily and desperately for
their food- news, interesting opinions and information. Countless print and
wireless media journalists and commentators must be constantly combing the
web environment. But clearly all media have a potential synergetic
relationship. By acting quickly and stealthily individual writers, such as
Allen Ginsberg, Abbie Hoffan and others in the 60's demonstrated so
unbelievably brilliantly how writers can utilize their imaginative powers to
redirect the attention of the mass media. The appetite on the part of the
media, as those writers and countless others have showed us so powerfully,
is there. The amazingly rapid success of Sam Hamill's experiment in poetic
anthologizing in finding a way to focus the political power of the web for
poets is encouraging. At last count 4600 poets have logged on. Meanwhile,
Brian Kim Stefans has jumped into the fray-with some understandable
trepidation- offering his own blog spot as an open forum for discussion on
the war. Dare I hope and say that working together- as countless activists
did in the late 60's- we can stop this war, or at least seriously slow it
down? I hope John Godfrey was right when he said yesterday at the Bowery
Poetry Club to me that he believed the momentum for this war among the
public is just not there. I've heard others express this opinion. I'm
excited to see the poetry community go into action so quickly and so
effectively before the body bags start piling up. Maya Lin is great, but I'd
rather see her express her formidable talents in other areas rather than a
Second Gulf or Third War War memorial.

once, a very wise man (i do believe it was Jim
Andrews) said to me: "We are all making the web."

I've had many disagreements with many excellent people
on many excellent lists. This is due mostly to my own
contentious streak. All of these disagreements have
taught me invaluable things. And these days, whenever
I sigh over some bit of web work I find fault with, I
always keep Jim's phrase in my mind, so that I may
temper any criticism I have with gentleness.

I only wish Bush would realize this chestnut of wisdom
that Jim gave me.

Last night on the local news I watched a young man saying goodbye to his =
wife and baby, a reservist heading to the Middle East. He said, "The =
most difficult thing about this is leaving my family." Not, "The most =
difficult thing about this is going to halfway around the world to kill =
people." Such are "family values" these days in the USA.

Robert Bly writes, in his poem, "The Battle of Ypes, 1915":

                          Some greedy part hankers for disaster, for =
things
                          To go wrong, for the war to start. Many people
                          Are disappointed when the bombing is canceled.

The poem is dedicated to Martin Prechtel, the son of my former =
Albuquerque neighbor, George. Martin was trained in Central America as a =
shaman (See, "M. Prechtel, "Secrets of the Talking Jaguar: A Mayan =
Shaman's Journey to the Heart of the Indigenous Soul." Los Angeles, =
1998.) He lives north of Santa Fe, where he cares for his family, tends =
his horses, and heals people. When he travels, he packs a medicine =
pouch, not a gun.
George is one of the few persons from New Mexico with whom I've stayed =
in touch. Retired, he reads Jungian books and takes brisk walks. He will =
not be disappointed if the bombing is cancelled.=20

Well, it's not just "these days," Joel. Remember Gen. Patton saying (roughly)
"I don't want you to die for your country. I want you to make that other poor

   I find the #'s attached to Nick's post disturbing..esp. from the ever so reliable V.V...used to be owned by Rupert Murdoch..now owned by a conglomerate mostly into real estate dev. and pet food....

   some #'s left out...

    1) deaths from Iraq's invasion of Iran...any where from 1 to 3 million on up...

    2) deaths from Saddam's internal repression...a few 100k...give or take a few hundred k..make up a figure and get any amnesty int. report... i'd add the 500,000 children's death...which a regime change would have allowed to live..

    3) est. spent on Saddam;s nuclear weapons and biological programs...10 to 20 billions on up..to the bathrooms of all of Sadamm's palaces..

  .. to  me the most troubling number.is the 500,00 children...altho Iraq's pop. has reportedly grown by 40 per cent since the first Gulf War.

    the position of both the French and Germans...the Democratic opposition to the War...and all the voices on the main stream left is that CONTAINMENT is the best answer to the Iraqui prob..tho the lala left has its own solutions...more inspectors, more over flights and dare i say continued sanctions...this is a an extension of the last decade...and if the figures are to be believed should result in the same deaths of 500k children...give or take a few 100k...as a footnote...Palestinian deaths in the two yrs of this Infantaada run 800 to 1,000........but when you're counting Saddam's K's...what's a few single deaths here or there...

    I'm going to leave the 6 mill..or so Rwandans out of this....whose only hope was a strong military response from the U.S..neither the Euros or the UN had the MILITARY FORCE....this did not happen for many many political reasons...not the least of which is the same morass of words...any military actions in any place would cause....stop the war....let 500,000  Iraqui children die...is that the plan.is that the poster....Harry...

READING The Tending Instinct (Shelley Taylor, Holt, 2002) set off some bells
for me as a nurturing male that I am mulling along with my morning coffee
that picks me up with Camels (tobacco auctioned not as often 5 miles away
but marketed via Dale via this afternoon's NASCAR 80 miles off to my
children and theirs) bought yesterday from a friendly-enough-looking man who
undoubtedly wishes he were faceless these days and whose father had
calculated for me the day before just how many cents I saved buying there as
his eyes rolled at my mention of taxes.  Today's headlines in the big city
paper include mention of Bush's possible appearance at the OK Corral of
Christian booksellers 60 miles off tomorrow and the departing (enplaning,
boating, enplaning?) of the 101st from 80 miles further.  We may speculate
in our own ways on loss of business and work for my daughter.

READING health Bulletin Boards Bill Boards thronging with females [Willie
Nelson featured on the the history channel's veterans award show and Marriah
Carey as celerbritysurvivor slamdunking at the allstar game] where men are
sometimes allowed to participate as pretend experts and then put down for
that pretense and Oprah out of Nashville out of Milwaukee continues to
prosper.

READING all the news that poetry is making and the slamming and reputating
that is bound to appear but out of the thickets of blooming blogs and
listserv brouhahas, hubbubs, and uproars does seem to be emerging some
thoughts worth thinking even though I haven't seen much in the way of
tending yet and I have to admit my first impulse comes from the old fight or
flight axis and it's only a bit later that society lets me tend.

IS IT POSSIBLE to make poetry out of healthcare and warfare or are they
making their own.[googling turns up Humor central, Tupac, slams, etc. but
you have to dig some to find WCW who said

      Transitional

 First he said:
 It is the woman in us
 That makes us write--
 Let us acknowledge it--
 Men would be silent.
 We are not men
 Therefore we can speak
 And be conscious
 (of the two sides)
 Unbent by the sensual
 As befits accuracy.

 I then said:
 Dare you make this
 Your propaganda?

 And he answered:
 Am I not I--here?

 [(from The Tempers, 1913

WRITING from the gut is perhaps a two stage process?  I'd like to read the
second poets that all those poets wrote when they realized that they were
banned from the stage of a librarian wife's acquiescence to a husband's
cowboy impulse.  this is of course only one way of peeling the onion but
when it comes down to it I'm fortunate to be able to type this out and send
it off?

BACK TO writing.

READING The Tending Instinct (Shelley Taylor, Holt, 2002) set off some bells
for me as a nurturing male that I am mulling along with my morning coffee
that picks me up with Camels (tobacco auctioned not as often 5 miles away
but marketed via Dale via this afternoon's NASCAR 80 miles off to my
children and theirs) bought yesterday from a friendly-enough-looking man who
undoubtedly wishes he were faceless these days and whose father had
calculated for me the day before just how many cents I saved buying there as
his eyes rolled at my mention of taxes.  Today's headlines in the big city
paper include mention of Bush's possible appearance at the OK Corral of
Christian booksellers 60 miles off tomorrow and the departing (enplaning,
boating, enplaning?) of the 101st from 80 miles further.  We may speculate
in our own ways on loss of business and work for my daughter.

READING health Bulletin Boards Bill Boards thronging with females [Willie
Nelson featured on the the history channel's veterans award show and Marriah
Carey as celerbritysurvivor slamdunking at the allstar game] where men are
sometimes allowed to participate as pretend experts and then put down for
that pretense and Oprah out of Nashville out of Milwaukee continues to
prosper.

READING all the news that poetry is making and the slamming and reputating
that is bound to appear but out of the thickets of blooming blogs and
listserv brouhahas, hubbubs, and uproars does seem to be emerging some
thoughts worth thinking even though I haven't seen much in the way of
tending yet and I have to admit my first impulse comes from the old fight or
flight axis and it's only a bit later that society lets me tend.

IS IT POSSIBLE to make poetry out of healthcare and warfare or are they
making their own.[googling turns up Humor central, Tupac, slams, etc. but
you have to dig some to find WCW who said

      Transitional

 First he said:
 It is the woman in us
 That makes us write--
 Let us acknowledge it--
 Men would be silent.
 We are not men
 Therefore we can speak
 And be conscious
 (of the two sides)
 Unbent by the sensual
 As befits accuracy.

 I then said:
 Dare you make this
 Your propaganda?

 And he answered:
 Am I not I--here?

 [(from The Tempers, 1913

WRITING from the gut is perhaps a two stage process?  I'd like to read the
second poets that all those poets wrote when they realized that they were
banned from the stage of a librarian wife's acquiescence to a husband's
cowboy impulse.  this is of course only one way of peeling the onion but
when it comes down to it I'm fortunate to be able to type this out and send
it off?

BACK TO writing.

Dear Mr. President this morning i called my cousin in Wyoming
his boyfriend was making the coffee like many good people do
in this beautiful country my cousin told me to tell you it's madness
you bring us when i told him i was writing to you today it's been
awhile since i've seen you in person on the streets of Philadelphia
you were waving and then you were speaking hey we've all heard
the stories of your cocaine and booze and i want to say i'm sorry
about your parents i'm sure other children of CIA brass need a
little craziness to get a little loose do a line of coke get naked and
run around campus were you freer back then of course you were
i'm an idiot for asking and i remember cologne when you spoke in
Philadelphia and i know it was your cologne you had that
i'm-wearing-cologne air about you see i believe there's a
big man inside you and yes we're angry right now yes it's
about war yes it's about many things the things men with
little time for love will impose on others and i wish i could
say HEY we're all going to be dead in a hundred years so let's
shift the pace let's forget about war let's pass a Let's Get
Naked And Crazy National Holiday i wish it was this easy but
nothing is ever easy with a man who has little time for love
and a man with little time for love is really just a man who
hasn't had love yet you haven't really had love yet there's no
way you could have had love real love and not want every human
body to have medical care if they need it have education if they
want it have more time with their families and loves like we all
NEED it Mr. President i'm worried your self esteem was damaged
many years ago and keeps you from seeing us out here our bodies
our black and white and red and yellow and Iraqi and Korean bodies
and we're all a little fucked-up with our problems but i know i JUST
know there's a big man inside of you big enough to really SEE need
and offer without hesitation because you can because there is plenty
you are stronger than your father's blueprints for your life i've seen
your fingers in person you have nice hands Mr. President and they're
your hands not your father's hands your life is your own it really is
it belongs to you and love is waiting i have a lot of love Mr. President
and i just want to press against you sometimes to let you get a little
of it HEY i'm so serious about this let's go away together this spring
just the two of us it's not a big deal don't even tell anybody i mean
you're the president after all but there's a marvelous stretch of woods
where i grew up we could smoke a little pot to wind you down get you
out of your oval office mode maybe a little wine i'm sure you need a
good massage maybe we could go to the creek and paint secret
mud symbols on our naked bodies like i used to do with my first
boyfriend what happens after that will be fine you'll see it will
be okay the break in the woods has the best flowers to rest
beside in the sun and you will awaken with a crown of honeysuckle
beautiful man that you are a real leader of real
lives who can change the world

with real love waiting for you

The lala left in this case includes most Americans, the overwhelming
majority of Europeans, and the governments of France, Germany, Russia,
China, and most of the other countries on earth. For want of a better
reason to favor containment (and there are plenty) the extreme
unpredictability of war and its aftermath for all concerned is sufficient.

As to those death tolls, Saddam is a monster, but most of those children
died as a result of sanctions, and the Iran war was fought by Iraq with our
encouragement and as our surrogate, albeit a willing one. The weapons
employed were supplied by guess who? The sanctions could easily be modified
short of either regime-support or war. Meanwhile, we can assume that Saddam
isn't immortal.

If, on the other hand, Saddam manages to make so many concessions in the
next week, as he apparently has begun to do, that US attack will become
more embarassing than it's worth, all those troops are already very
expensively in place. Think of all the other countries in the region  that
pose no immanent threat but are just waiting to be beat-up on.

I'm reminded of Jimmy Carter's response when a reporter asked him about our
invasiuon of Granada: "I didn't doubt for a minute that we could take
them."  The goal of that invasion seemed to me then to impress upon the
rest of the world's governments that we were not only supremely powerful
but just as crazy as they feared. Imagine a two-year-old with hydrogen
bombs. Whatever it asked for, who would refuse?

I am passionately in love with this country, but often it's not the
happiest of passions.

Here's something to ponder. It's the Senate's job to declare wars and
approve treaties, not that the current administration cares much about such
niceties, but if Bush asks its support remember that the Republican
majority consists of states with 42% of the US population. Not all senators
are created equal.

"cynical and
corrupt or psychotic and moral"

I think it's all of the above.  I think what happens is a process of
rationalization breathing inside a hard shell of denial.  Opportunism takes
root, and little by little, the more power one has, the less proximal he is
to personal relationships with those he makes decisions for, and handles
matters in more and more extreme ways, ways that reflect the lack of
proximity to the millions.  we're all stupid in some sense; stupidity isn't
the difference between any one of us and bush.  it's something else
entirely, a pattern of behavior permitted and nurtured through child
development into adolescence and into adulthood.  piles of cash.  dreams of
being a pirate like my daddy, like my granddaddies.  money makes things
easier.  people trained to feel bad about doing nice things.  and
encouraging others to join in the psychotic crusade.  the crusade is at once
cynical and corrupt and psychotic and moral, despite the inherent
contradiction within labeing one individual with all four words.  absolute
power corrupts absolutely, but the approximation of absolute power is
achieved step by step.  it is the product of another organism, another
creature, who is in so many respects uncannily similar to each of us.  this
organism is opportunistic, like all organisms, but it's been trained to
handle higher-level opportunities than most other organisms in its species
and to capitalize on those opportunities.  working at that distal level is
insane obscene self-centered and definitely corrupt, but it certainly also
comes with the feeling of moral righteousness.  the behavior and the moral
representation of the behavior.  because feeling good IS good, and what
makes an organism like george bush feel good?  Iraq's oil is certainly
central to the policy making, and that oil represents vast potential wealth.
if the bushies don't steal the oil, they fear that saddam will become
powerful, immensely so (as much oil as saudi arabia potentially, but of a
much higher quality), and that oil will tip the scales of geopolitics with
his immense potential wealth.  to date it's clear that in buying the
interests of france and russia with his vast potential oil wealth, saddam is
already tipping the scales.  so there's the moral justification for bush; i
think that he believes it is righteous to steal the oil.  (and that it is
righteous to evaporate civil liberties, one by one.  because capital capital
capitalizing on fear is capital-izing.  moral righteousness, reward.  bush
is undoubtedly nuts with all od the sick things he's done and said (laughing
about an execution and displaying utterly all-too-human sadistic disrespect
for the inmates family.)  france and russia's lack of support only
underscore this idea for bush's advisers.  at every step the rewards of who
wins from a decision of some powerful government executive such as the
president create a moral incentive (however distorted such a concept is) for
that executive to choose what is clearly corrupt to many of us.  but that
can only succeed only so far as the people will allow it.  no one man can
ever have absolute power unless people reliquish their power absolutely, and
that ain't never gonna happen nohow.

control.  control.  control.

thanks
patrick

Growing up would require us all, in the face of having our names used to
endorse a crime of world-historical proportions, to eschew quibbling over
theories about motives until we have either prevented the crime or
apprehended the criminals.

Anyway, this comes down to whether you believe Bsh II is cynical and
corrupt or psychotic and moral.

Aside from the Paul McCartney & Carl Perkins album

Ashbery's "A Blessing in Disguise" is a great love poem, though with the
beloved weirdly shimmery and absent.   Had it read at my wedding
anyway.  Maybe the budding entrepreneurs in Ankara will dig it.

On a totally different tangent (or is it?), I wonder if it's alright to
be against the war because you hate the way Rumsfeld *moves his hands*.

The whole morality point really is the war's tagline & slogan, it's like a
movie poster: an epic battle of good vs. evil, which is what's so
frightening, as it also distances us so much from it. I wonder how many
folks there were sitting around a table somewhere saying:
"Evil empire?"
"No, too Star Wars."
"Axis of Evil?"
"humm, that's good, it's almost poetic."

I will leave this alone after this post.

All I wanted to get across was 1) to reaffirm the condition of war as
present
and not just imminent, and 2) that moral conviction, or the appearance of
it,
is an extremely effective weapon for Bush -- one that is easy to dismiss as
false, and yet to be effectively argued against by his opposition, in my
opinion (only)... and I am part of that opposition, if that actually had to
be fucking made clear to anyone. Adios.

I don't if New Advice represents a sad, paranoid version of "growing up"  o=
r
primarily a tool for survival if the Moral is used to precipitate an
invasion and "democratic occupation" (talk about an oxymoron), but I do
suspect I wrote the following from down inside some psychic level in which =
I
am experiencing the apprehension and terror of the arrival of those moral
agents - read most probably the FBI or your local Homeland Security Rep -
the avengers whose job is and will be to clear the population of doubters,
unclean pluralists, the anarchists, anyone who might be working to take the
self-declared Vector off his Righteous course:


New Advice

Hold on to your hat, your coat, your shirt, belt, pants, underwear.
Close down your skin, your muscle, your bones, your blood.
Hang on to your sperm, your eggs, your delivery or receptive tools.
If they did not come yesterday, they will be here today or tomorrow.
They are not elected. They are self-chosen. If not chosen, they are
    appointed.=20
When they knock, point out the hole in their socks, the out of place whiske=
r
next to a beige mole on the chin. Nickel and dime them with petty truths:
The sky is green. The ocean is yellow. The poll results are "interesting."
If they press harder, talk about the sex life between you
and their well known director. Implicate yourself in the pleasure
of providing him or her with normally unspeakable acts. Somewhere between
the lapel and shoulder pad, the recorder is on. Your words will kill the
   tape.
This is evidence they cannot show or replay in public or private. It=B9s
your
   word
against theirs. Call it  "a poetry of distraction." In the meantime,
beware the false landscape. Find safe shelter. Anything
may catastrophically drop during "breaking news". Look up
through dark coated glasses. Register the national 1-800 number. Report
instances of fallen debris. Photograph but don=B9t touch. Toxicity
may be frequent. Walk carefully. Preserve vision at any speed.

Liechtenstein for rent

Friday, February 7, 2003 Posted: 12:33 PM EST (1733 GMT)

ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters) -- Country for hire, one careful owner.

The tiny principality of Liechtenstein is putting itself up for rent in
a bid to attract corporate conferences and bolster its tourism
industry, a local official said Friday.

The new "Rent a State" program lets corporate clients symbolically take
over the tiny country of just 33,000 residents tucked away among the
Alps between Switzerland and Austria.

"The basic idea is that an entire, small country plays host to a
conference with all the various possibilities at its disposal," said
Roland Buechel, director of the state tourism agency in Liechtenstein,
which covers an area of 60 square miles.

Rent a State is based on the Rent a Village concept developed by event
management firm Xnet AG in small towns in Austria, Germany and
Switzerland.

Xnet will drum up business among corporate customers seeking a site for
meetings, while the tourism agency will work with local authorities and
help organize rooms and program ideas.

Customers will get tailor-made programs that put their brand on display
and involve local officials -- but not the monarch Prince Hans Adam --
in special events.

"It is not envisioned to include the prince or government officials,"
Buechel said.

I'm new to the list, but know some of you from other
fora.

I wanted to let everyone know about a non-profit word
consortium I've started to provide online resources to
writers called Eat More Words, on the web at
http://www.eatmorewords.org

The main member benefit is access to the online OED.
Generally for individuals a yearly subscription is
$550, but under the aegis of the foundation we are
offering a year membership at $10/year until we launch
on or around March 1. Membership will be $12/year
thereafter.

Please also sign up on the notification list.

Should membership revenue exceed the cost of providing
these services -- and we hope that it will! -- we will
launch The Apicule Literary Award, and may  publish a
book of poetry in cooperation with a small press.
Future features may also include a subscription to the
xrefer plus reference library.

There is more info on the site.

Eat More Words operates under the auspices of The
Apicule Foundation, which will begin offering
microgrants to artists in mid-2003.

Best,

Caterina Fake

>The veracity of Colin Powell's report on Wednesday before the United =
Nations Security Council was dealt a serious blow when Britain's Channel =
4 News broke a story that severely undermines the credibility of the =
intelligence Powell used to make his case to the UN.=20
>=20
>Powell's presentation relied in no small part upon an intelligence =
dossier prepared by the British Government entitled, "Iraq - Its =
Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation." That report =
plagiarized large swaths of an essay written in September of 2002 by a =
graduate student from California named Ibrahim al-Marashi. Al-Marashi's =
essay appeared in the September 2002 edition of a small journal, the =
Middle East Review of International Affairs.=20
>=20
>According to the story from Channel 4 News, which was later augmented =
by an Associated Press report by Jill Lawless, the duplicate text was =
first spotted by a Cambridge, England academic named James Ranwala. =
Apparently, Ranwala read the British dossier when it became available =
and believed he had seen it before. As it turns out, he was correct. =
Entire sections of the al-Marashi essay, including six full paragraphs =
in one section, had been cut and pasted into the British dossier, =
including several spelling and grammatical errors that are identical.=20
>=20
>According to the Associated Press, al-Marashi had no idea his paper was =
being used by the British. "It was a shock to me," he told the =
Associated Press, and expressed the hope that the British would credit =
his work "out of academic decency."=20

>These shifting appointments are part of Saddam's policy of balancing =
security positions. By constantly shifting the directors of these =
agencies, no one can establish a base in a security organisation for a =
substantial period of time. No one becomes powerful enough to challenge =
the President."=20

>"Saddam appointed, Sabir 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Duri(80) as head of Military =
Intelligence during the 1991 Gulf War.(81) After the Gulf War he was =
replaced by Wafiq Jasim al-Samarrai.(82)=20
>=20
>After Samarrai, Muhammad Nimah al-Tikriti(83) headed Military =
Intelligence in early 1992(84) then in late 1992 Fanar Zibin Hassan =
al-Tikriti was appointed to this post.(85) While Fanar is from Tikrit, =
both Sabir al-Duri and Samarrai are non-Tikriti Sunni Muslims, as their =
last names suggest.=20
>=20
>Another source indicates that Samarrai was replaced by Khalid Salih =
al-Juburi,(86) demonstrating how another non-Tikriti, but from the =
tribal alliance that traditionally support the regime holds top security =
positions in Iraq.(87)=20
>=20
>These shifting appointments are part of Saddam's policy of balancing =
security positions between Tikritis and non-Tikritis, in the belief that =
the two factions would not unite to overthrow him. Not only that, but by =
constantly shifting the directors of these agencies, no one can =
establish a base in a security organization for a substantial period of =
time, that would challenge the President.(88)"=20
>=20
>After a close analysis of the identical text from both reports, it is =
also clear that Britain altered key words to give their report a more =
sinister and ominous twist. The British report states that the Iraqi =
intelligence agency is "spying on foreign embassies in Iraq." The =
al-Marashi essay's version states that the Iraqi intelligence agency is =
"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq." The rhetorical leap from =
"monitoring" to "spying" is evident.=20
>=20
>In another portion of the British dossier, Iraq is accused of =
"supporting terrorist organizations in hostile regimes." The al-Marashi =
essay's version states that Iraq is "aiding opposition groups in hostile =
regimes." The insertion of the word "terrorist" is manifestly =
provocative.=20
>=20
>A disturbing series of questions is raised by this matter. Mr. Powell =
relied heavily upon "facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence," =
often from foreign intelligence services such as the British. His =
presentation was meant not only to establish the fact that Iraq is in =
possession of prohibited weapons, but also that Iraq enjoys ties to =
terrorist groups like al Qaeda. In light of this data, the factual basis =
for these claims is in doubt. Britain's report was touted as an =
up-to-the-minute intelligence review of the situation in Iraq. In fact, =
much of it is based upon the work of a graduate student who published =
his essay five months ago.=20
>=20
>Furthermore, if the al-Marashi essay was worthy of plagiarizing, why =
did the British feel it necessary to alter certain key phrases so as to =
make it seem that Iraq is spying on foreign embassies and aiding =
terrorist groups? The manipulation of the original data appears, on the =
surface, to have been done in bad faith.=20
>=20
>An analysis of the footnotes for the al-Marashi essay clearly =
demonstrate that his work was meant to describe Iraq's intelligence =
apparatus and military situation in the 1990s. The British dossier was =
presented as an up-to-date report on the status of Iraq's weapons and =
terrorist ties. There are 106 reference footnotes in the essay. 103 of =
these footnotes reference reports and articles from 1988 to 2000. Only =
three are from this century, and all of them reference reports from =
2001. This is not current data in any context.=20
>=20
>Clearly, Mr. Powell cannot be held responsible for the veracity of data =
given to him by the British government. The fact remains, however, that =
the British intelligence data, which comes from the most steadfast ally =
of the Bush administration, has been severely undermined by this report. =
This calls into question the veracity of virtually every aspect of =
Powell's presentation to the United Nations.=20
>=20
>If the American Secretary of State was given such shoddily-assembled =
data from its most loyal ally, how can the rest of the data be =
considered dependable? The data on Zarqawi and Ansar al-Islam came from =
Jordanian intelligence, a source much less trustworthy than the British. =
Many of the "human sources" cited by Powell were, in fact, detainees in =
Guantanamo, Cuba. These sources are suspect at best, yet were a =
significant part of the basis for Powell's accusations that Iraq is =
working with al Qaeda and developing a wide variety of prohibited =
weapons. Between these sources and the unreliable data from the British, =
it seems all too clear that Powell's entire presentation was based upon =
information that is questionable to say the least.=20
>=20
>Finally, and most significantly, is the question of intent. The United =
States will have soon placed approximately 150,000 troops in the region =
surrounding Iraq with the full intention of going to war. Such a =
conflict is almost certain to cause destabilizing upheavals in the =
Middle East which could threaten the global community. More ominously, =
the CIA and FBI have reported that a war in Iraq will definitely lead to =
terrorist attacks in America and a number of European nations, including =
Britain. This matter must now be framed in a new light. Does the British =
government believe it acceptable to assist the United States in going to =
war on the word of a graduate student from Monterey?=20
>=20
>The revelation of this data could conceivably come to do significant =
harm to the Bush administration's attempt to assemble a "Coalition of =
the Willing" for an attack upon Iraq. Tony Blair and Britain have been, =
since the beginning, the most fundamentally important members of =
whatever international coalition Mr. Bush is able to assemble.=20
>=20
>This report could shake Blair's standing with his government and his =
people. Blair's relationship with his own party, and with the British =
citizenry, has already proven rocky on the subject of his alliance with =
the Bush administration over this conflict. If Blair's ability to stand =
with Mr. Bush becomes undermined, Mr. Bush would find himself almost =
completely isolated on this issue.=20

Hi Mark -


If we stopped the Bush, we wouldn't even be having any such discussion!

We should not as a nation allow this criminal regime to endure.

Stop the war?

YES BUT DON'T FORGET!!!

     ***IMPEACH BUSH!***

is what I shout.  He ripped off the American public & the IRS breaking the
SEC laws...Harken anyone?  That's not good enough reason (but getting a
blowjob is?).

    ***IMPEACH CHENEY!***

Where are the energy commission's documents, Dick?  What were you discussing
at those meetings, hmm?  Can't we decide whether such things are OK, hmm?
Democracy, Dick?  You know, D-E-M-O-C-R-A-C-Y?

With Patriot II on the way, I could be arrested on suspicion of terrorism,
and secretly so, just for suggesting even the democratic removal of this
creep and his fellow zombies.  My calculable "worst-case scneario," as they
would calculate form my post, is that someone who speaks like this could
later become a less rational sort of threat--a terrorist.  To everyone
around me it would just seem like I disappeared.  No FOIA access, no trace
at all.  Paranoia?  Or possibility?  We all know it's happened before in
history, it happens elsewhere now as you read this, it maybe even happens
here already...but if it doesn't, it's clearly on it's way.

the nazis are taking over this town with churches cars prisons liquor stores
guns lawyers drugs rape and credit cards.

The war is one of just many of our problems.  We have so many problems that
stem from the mad righteousness of this criminal & exploitative
administration, and we're going to continue to have more and more as long as
these creeps run the executive branch.

Ace of Hearts


You have a choice: upstairs with mommy or downstairs with a stick

It's one blurry firm a very apoplectic notion turns in on its
resident, all brittle things a nuisance, not knighted by any peep hole

"As our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make
our world safer, we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country,
to make this world better. In an age of miraculous medicines, no one should
have to hear these words

Can anyone measure up? Can anyone tell? She walked
his lines when the breaks stumbled under her feet; she
couldn't crawl to the end of the poem. He heard the rain fall
hard, spotlights of the video shoot unable to soften the thuds

But being shot at is no fun, and I never got used to it.
Because of our highly realistic training, this enemy for the first time
has a deeply ingrained fear that he or she will fail when meeting
grenade explosions and screaming men. A battlefield is also very
dirty with dust, wood chips and debris everywhere

Trucks might be loading fuel rods in North Korea; on the other
side of the world, in our trucks, we spend as much as can
before it's exhausted. A numbing agent. "My hearing is sound-
proof." He could hear the radio whimpering in her room, worried
that it was about war, about face. My thoughts end at the
window; my window begins at the thought. He's schooled after he's hungry

The climate of hating season is early upon us - the Seizure
Pram. They should cudgel the pill this week. The only songs
we're leering are how is going with whim, who boats a mass
in Manhattan, which loam company won't go tall if you
think, the most expressive tex face, and on and on and on.
The gossip emerges alone, cold powers the budding eccentricity
for the rust of the murky myriad

Congratulations! You are now hopelessly infertile.


I lead a double life. On one side of the page, I am quiet and unassuming. On
the side that nobody sees, I am a seething profligate.

Beneath my blistered feet churns a maelstrom. I instinctively feel its
vastness and that it is too deep and too cold.

One shadow gives back red, the other green. My smile conceals a gilded
frown. The food was a little out of focus, but I ate it anyway. I wanted to
sleep more tonight, but was engorged by emergency dreams.

Today I was digging thourgh some boxes of books in my (trans-Pacific)
storage room, and the debris of my life.  I cam upon a musty little stack
of journals from my undergraduate days at Berkeley-- Occident, Hyperion,
Berkeley Poetry Review and others.  They contain some of the interesting
first work published by writers such as Leslie Scalapino, Andrew Ross (the
an aspiring poet in Wheeler Hall), and for example a torqued lyric by
"Ronald Silliman" called "After the Pastoral, Driving with my Grandfater
to the Place Where Scott Coles Died, The Realities, An Aside For Rochelle"
(even the title then aspiring to eh deformatoin  serial of the New
Sentence).  But what woke me from my torpor of excess literariness was
thiscomment by Mark Schorer thatt William Burroughs, if he were invited to
teach in a university like Cal, "would be more useful in Home Economics,
teaching the use of scissors-- and needles?-- than in literature, teaching
something about composition."  And where are the new-critical snows of
yesteryear like
you Mark Schorer, and where have all the vicious sexist classist dumb
flowers gone?  Gone to a literary seminar in heaven to be sure,to start
over,
Rob Wilson

Cubism made me turn a corner
in my relationships with women.
I was living in a box of an apartment
on third street;  thus ensconced,
the reverberations of backward
compatability reached chutney
fingers through my pillow at night.
Accordingly, I never slept.  Most days
it snowed curry.

                             She was not just
knee-deep she was totally deep when
she did the freak with me. Though
she had the more current operating
system, I was able to slide through
her registry and announce myself in
a tiny, uninvited dll. He somehow
mapped a drive between us, a hub
of LAN sparkling pugnaciously under
the risotto sky we'd come to call
Reudens together.  He always seemed
particularly eager to see my flesh,
especially in motion, but when I suggested
we meet he backed off quickly. He
suggested a restaurant that served only
steak, and that quite rare; filets as
pinks as embarassed dusk. Knowing
full well that I'm a vegan,

                                           he
directed me to sites that sold
"Omaha Steaks," told me
it excited him very much, the thought
of forkfuls of tender veal in
my mouth. I got a thang, you got
a thang, ev'rybody got a thang.
I sat at that restaurant all night,
thumbing nervously the pages of
a book on Pop Art; to this day, there's
a print of A1 sauce on some of James
Rosenquist's finest work. She never
showed. A similar streak
of mustard, undoubtably from
a yesteryear lunch of salami on rye,
adorns my copy of Derrida's
Grammatology. What did the author
mean by it? After a while I got up,

paid the bill, and went home. Outside
the sky was twisted all over itself like
black licorice. Once back in my apartment,
wholly separate, I started boxing up
my things. It was time to keep on movin'.

INTERVIEW WITH AUGUST HIGHLAND BY ANDREW SHELLEY

(Andrew Shelley is an oxford- and cambridge-educated
poet, writer,
essayist and literary critic. He is the author of two
poetry collections,
"The Requiem Tree" and "Peaceworks".)



Andrew Shelley:

I like the kind of tricks your work is always playing
with the literary
establishment and with our expectations derived from
it and elsewhere,
but do you intend your work be taken as anything other
than that?

August Highland:

No. Absolutely not. I never play tricks in the sense
of hoaxes or
games. The tactics i am using are motivated by a very
serious commitment to
the western literary tradition. My work questions the
literary status
quo and the expectations of readers because this is
what a writer is
obligated to do, otherwise he is in the wrong
profession.


AS:
You have said elsewhere that the implementation of
technology aided you
in the attainment of your literary voice. How?

AH:
This is a very easy question to answer. The answer is
very closely tied
to what i stated in response to your first question.
Another inherent
responsibility that a writer must accept is allowing
himself to be a
vehicle or a voice of the generation in which he is
producing his literary
work. Otherwise he is creating in a vacuum and his
work has no validity
for society and makes no contribution to the
historical timeline of
civilization. We are living in what i call a
"technoculture" or
"hyper-literary age" or a "digital media generation".


AS:
Do you disown all the writing you produced prior to
your
technology-aided work? Was it more traditional? Would
you be willing to let us see
some of that work?

AH:
I do not disown any writing that i produced prior to
my creating
"hyper-literary fiction" and to my founding the
"worldwide literati
mobilization network". My earlier work was more
traditional in the sense that i
did not utilize digital tools in the production of my
text. I would not
show anyone this work because it has no pertinence to
anything other
than being an important stage in my development as a
writer.


AS:
The "worldwide literati mobilization network" is a
simulated literary
movement and all the members of the wlmn are your
multiple personas. Do
you still then want us to see and read your work as
"yours" and as
issuing from a "voice". Don't those terms issue from
the whole mythology of
the "autocratic" author and his presiding
consciousness you wish to
reject?

AH:
I do not want the reader to read the work by the
members of the wlmn as
issuing from me. I reject the whole autocratic
mythology. I reject the
centralized role of the author. I reject these belief
systems or
mythologies. The members of the wlmn are not me. Not
mine. Each member of the
wlmn however IS an autocratic writer. I have rejected
the myth. They
haven't.


AS:
How is a reader to locate himself/herself in your
work? What points of
reference can you provide?

AH:
Just as with the wlmn i have de-centralized the
author/authority/authoritarian position of the
man/woman behind the writing, the wlmn writers
extract from their work as many points of reference
that they can
without allowing the work to disintegrate. They
provide just enough points
of reference for the reader to be able to provide
his/her own reference
points. The writing is consolidated enough for the
reader to follow but
it is also tenuous enough to allow the reader to
infuse the work with
his/her own metaphors. The effect of hyper-literary
fiction allows the
reader to be immersed in the text and at the same time
to invest the
text with his/her own reality.


AS:
What led you to reject the notion of the author as a
unified presiding
consciousness? Can't we be diverse but unified? One in
many and many in
one?

AH:
My fundamental belief about the human psyche is that
the individual is
a very small part of a vastly greater whole. The
worldwide literati
mobilization network is a reflection of this. I
believe in the jungian and
the archetypal psychology notions that there is a
collective
unconscious comprised of a multitude of archetypes or
discrete transpersonal
selves that form the foundation of human
consciousness. I also believe in the jungian concept
of "complexes"
which are a group of selves that are correlated with
the archetypes. The
distinction between the two is that the archetypal
selves are
transpersonal or common to all human beings and the
complexes are a group of
selves unique to each individual. The archetypes are
innate. The complexes
circumstantial. That is to say that the complexes are
formed within our
psyche in response to each of our unique set of life
experiences.
This is what led me to renounce the notion of the
author as a unified
autocratic consciousness.
The second part of your question was: "Can't we be
diverse but
unified?". Yes we certainly are diverse AND unified.
One in many AND many in
one. That is exactly the principle concept behind the
worldwide literati
mobilization network. The members of the wlmn are the
"many". But the
members of the wlmn, the "many" are not me. I am not
the "one". I am
just as much a part of the "one" as each of the
members are. The "one" is
the collective unconscious interacting with the
personal unconscious,
or the archetypes interacting with complexes. The only
role i play in
all of this is that i am the person in which all of
these psychic forces
are dramatically being played out. I am more like the
announcer at a
soccer match. That's really my role as the author. The
players on the
field are the archetypes and complexes.


AS:
I want to discuss the issue of the relation between
randomly generated
text and how you modify it? To what extent and how
exactly, according
to what criteria, do you modify randomly generated
text?

AH:
There exists a misconception of hyper-literary fiction
as being
randomly generated or "programmatic" text. It is not.
The contribution of the
software and programming scripts that i utilize in the
production of my
work is actually very minimal. At one time, a couple
of decades ago or
even longer than that, the issue of programmatic
versus
non-programmatic literary work was a valid subject of
discourse and debate. When
writers began to use programming aids at the advent of
the technological age
they were adopting an aesthetic position that was a
radical departure
from the literary forms that were practiced at that
time. Today this is
no longer a viable issue. Technological tools form an
everyday part of
our lives now. They have become "self-extensions". The
demarcation
between people and technology is no longer an
earthquake fault in the
landscape of our culture. It is now just a line in the
sand. The digital
tools i use to assist me in the production of my work
are no different
than the mallet and chisel of a sculptor carving
marble.


AS:
How seriously are we to take your work? Isn't it more
interesting for
the theoretical implications it raises than anything
else? Aren't you
going to interest academics to the exclusion of other
forms of readers?
Isn't this more exclusionary than the "autocratic
author" ideology?

AH:
My audiences are both academia and readers.
Hyper-literary fiction has
dual-significance. An editor-in-chief of an academic
journal or a
professor of modern literature or new media will read
my work for the
conceptual significance and readers will read
hyper-literary fiction for the
same reason they would want to read any other new
literary work that is
adding to the spectrum of literary forms and
delivering content that
engages them. I am a reader and I like to read work
that tells me i am an
"important" reader and an "intelligent" reader and a
"creative" reader
and a "self-sufficient" reader. I don't want to hear
what is in the
author's mind because i really don't care what they
think and i really
don't care what they have to say. I want the author to
be interested in
what is in MY mind. This is what i want an author to
do for me. I want
him/her to collaborate with me and to invite me to
contribute to his/her
work. I created hyper-literary fiction to meet my own
needs as a
reader. Since the work by the members of the worldwide
literati mobilization
network are not me, i cannot be accused of making
arrogant assertions
by disclosing this.
The second part of your question was: Isn't this more
exclusionary than
the "autocratic author" ideology?
I earnestly dismiss this as being part of the
motivation behind my
work. As i was just saying my work "invites" the
reader to project into my
work his/her mental landscape or psychological terrain
or creative
imagery and associations. My work (and also my work as
an editor of a
literary journal) is founded upon the tenet of
inclusion.


AS:
Do you think traditional writing can effect the kind
of destabilization
and derangement you speak of in one of your
introductions? If so, why
not try to do it that way? Has it ever been done
before? Does that
matter? Do you want us to look for precedents to your
work - Burroughs comes
to mind - and how far do you wish to be seen as
continuing that trend?

AH:
Yes, traditional writing absolutely can achieve the
same kind of effect
as hyper-literary fiction. In fact nearly all of the
writers (over 400
in the winter 2003 issue) in the literary journal of
which i am the
editor and which is called the "muse apprentice guild"
are using
traditional means to achieve the same end that i am
concerned with achieving.
In response to the second part of your question, i do
write poetry from
a traditional approach almost daily.
As for the last part of your question concerning
precedents. I do not
wish to be seen as continuing the trend of writers
like William S.
Burroughs. This is because he is classified as an
iconoclast and a
subversive writer and an eccentric and heroine junkie,
etc. We live in a
different world now. There is no place in the literary
profession for junkies
and eccentric narcissists and cult figures and
careerists and people
with psychological disorders who are not attending to
their condition by
taking the appropriate medication or for any other
type of romanticized
self-destructive individuals. The world we live in
today is a
pro-humanity pro-earth world. So no, i don't want to
be associated with anyone
who is considered an extremist or a subversive. The
only modern writer i
can think of whom i consider to have contributed to my
development as a
writer would be Samuel Beckett, but only the early
novels by him and
not his dramatic work. I am not making a value
statement about his plays.
I simply have always read novels.


AS:
What do you think of work that is similar to yours but
produced
entirely by human agency, by writers disabling the
"transparent sense-making"
part of writing?

AH:
I read it with a passion. I publish it with a passion.

An Alchemical Fascism emerges. Captain Frankenstain w/ Walt Whitman =
skin-mask leads his hemacite sculpture vessel "the peep o' day" to a =
giant retort in the Pacific Ocean. On board is the hundred foot tall =
animatronic Prometheus made of dried fish parts. A giant pipe organ on =
the prow is played by a female sigh-borg-satyr who is grown into the =
instrument. (see Alien) The Pacific Ocean is now all black, because all =
of it is ink. It is now called "THE SPECIFIC OCEAN" (see specificity as =
hack-art-strategy or perhaps demonstration of non-linear =
social-chaos-science) It is all ink. On the shores of all the continents =
are giant foo-lion ink-pumps which suck it in and pipe it to the =
writers. What are writers? Writers are industrial mechanisms who =
resemble dull metallic sarcophagi. They hang in racks like filigree =
racing carcasses, glowing vibrating flowchart skeletons, optiglyphic =
ghost-flows.  They are designed by intelligent androids from the =
jacquet-droz clock company. An industrial horological android can =
produce 10,000 writers a day. Their feet are filter mouths. They suck up =
the ink into their feet. You see it percolate up through their glass =
wombs, where the text is displayed, and then it is sprayed in =
high-velocity chaos-whorls on the "screen-belt" which is a constantly =
renewing memory-production-historical-vehicle-archive-of-violence. Why =
violence? Because all inscription is violence. Why is inscription =
violence? Because space is nice and innocent and not devilish and =
mysterious and hiding weird quantuum code-chimeras or anything, that's =
why. "There really aren't any Psychological Resins."  Then after all =
Captain Frankenstain gets sacrificed to the giant Retort of Ink and =

Dear Poets:

Thanks for your overwhelming response to my query about a Feb 12
anti-war  poetry event. ItÕs nice to know there are so many lefty poets
in this  town.

Since Steven Allen May is organizing a similar event for the same
evening,  we've joined forces and will be collaborating on a Poets for
Peace reading  at 7 PM at RobinÕs Bookstore on the 12th. Kitty Bryant of
Campaign to End  the Sanctions may still do another event earlier in the
day for those who  canÕt come to an evening event. I will forward any
announcements about  this to the list.

In the meantime, Steven and I are still taking names of people who want
to  read. Depending on the number of participants, we'll probably have
everyone read one or two poems. All comers will be welcome to read until
  we run out of time. To get your name early on the list, please let me
know  that you plan to attend. I'll be contacting the twenty-odd people
I've  already heard from. Someone from the Philadelphia Independent will
be  collecting submissions of protest poems at the reading, and they
will  probably select one or two for publication in the paper.

On the 12th, we will also be taking some time to discuss possibilities
for  organizing future protest poetry events in Philadelphia. We'll be
sending  around a sign-up sheet at the reading if you'd like to be
involved.  Possible future events include a National Poetry Month
reading later this  spring, the formation of a reading series or
workshop group, or group  participation in rallies and marches. If you
canÕt make the reading but  you're interested in organizing, please
contact me off the list.

beached whale

suppose you stood thinking too long
        long enough for a film to appear
        a film about your life

everything from the past
        laid out like a homeless sidewalk sale
                pet dishes and a constable with short quotes

- there was a time in school
- the road to nowhere
- a body that shook for the first time with intentionality
- and those ghastly reminders of a mispronounced nervous system
- and the one on the something that seemed to be unkept

and then there is this a rack focus on to another film
        the one you keep private, incomplete
                underdeveloped and missing a sound track
                        dried teared short a short story disasters
                                 an out of focus resolution

within the form of a casket
        you stand in unshakeable
                 repose response to mine fields and plot soaked bandages
then there is this massive scene
        an empire in the making
                a torrent of fire engulfs the extras
the sunrise is green
        knifes dart back and forth
                striking their intended targets
                        the unarmed are bulldozed it in the pits

a taxi arrives
        the driver announces-
                "the show's over, its time to go home"
                        the sun is nothing more than a postcard
                                with a plug in fireplace

and yet you do not move
        words end, generations forgotten,  and clouds pass
                someone tells you it's all going to play again on television
                        and still you remain frozen
                                 unmoved and forgotten

Thanks, Pierre, for posting this one. I am dispersing it to all my friends,
and for those in offices, suggesting that they gather and play it aloud to
colleagues - I imagine this experience of listening to George B. may well
seem ironically (& savagely so) akin to gathering around a Philco circa
1939.

Dear Laura Bush,

I am so sorry poetry symposium on the work of Dickinson,
Hughes and Whitman had to be cancelled. Perhaps you would
have heard someone read from the memoranda from Walt
Whitman. Perhaps it would have been this passage:

"June 18. Bad wounds, the Young.-- The souldiers are nearly
all young men, and far more American than is generally supposed --
I should say nine tenths are native born. Among them are arrivals
from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois men. as usual, there are all sorts of wounds. Some of the men
are severly burnt from the explosion of artillery caissons. One Ward
has a long row of officers, some with ugly hurts. Yesterday was
more worse than usual. Amputations are going on -- the attendants
are dressing wounds. As you pass by, you must be on your guard
where to look. I saw the other day a gentleman, a visitor apparently
from curiosity, in one of the wards, stop and turn at a moment an
awful wound they were probing, &c. he turned pale, and in a
moment more he had fainted and fallen on the floor."

Or perhaps someone present at the symposium might have read
this entry Walt Whitman made in the summer of 1864:

"In one of the fights before Atlanta, a rebel soldier, of large
size, evidently a young man, was mortally wounded in top
of the head, so that the brains partially exuded. He lived three
days, lying on his back on the spot where he first dropt. He
dug with his heel in the ground during that time a hole big
enough to put a couple of ordinary knapsacks. He just lay
there in the open air, and with little intermission kept his
heel going night and day. Some of our soldiers then moved
him to a house, but he died in a few minutes."

Maybe it's better you (more likely your handlers) cancelled
the symposium, since all three of those long dead poets might've
themselves had a lot to say about the soon-to-be lost ones.

Poet/sculptor/painter Jerome Robinson was killed Thursday morning in West Philadelphia. He spent the better part of the last three decades as a mainstay in the city's artscene. His work could be found regularly at places like the Highwire Gallery in Olde City. Jerome's poems were often heard in Philly poetry landmarks like the Middle East & the Bacchanal, sharing drinks and conversation with the likes of CA Conrad & Linh Dinh. His most recent installation was at the Painted Bride Arts Center, sponsored by the Ellen Powell Tiberrino Museum.

He was generous with his time & his spirit when I was practically a kid. The poems go on, but not without great sadness.

The Romance of Anti-terrorism

interrogation regarding her partially 3-year-old daughter. Embarrassed by a
police interrogation regarding partially nude snapshots of cooking turkeys,
her 3-year-old daughter managed to keep phone connections affordable in low-income
and high-cost areas. Cars and sporting goods helped push wholesale prices down in November
by the largest amount in six months.

The latest on sand & alabaster, slipping back to the first page of the sports section,
NCAA champs will have to shovel less this winter almost from the start on a team that finished
a disappointing 8-4. Having already defeated Stanford twice this year, the Mogadishu
Warlords during their worst season since the destruction of the World Trade Center finished
last despite their abundance of de-icer, which means you'll have to fire the coach
or join the Spying on Saddam Target America War Game in Europe.

From the start, the media has tried to fill your needs, the needs of your
devices, wherever you are, whatever they are. Alert submarines in the Gulf, mad generals
on the battlefields of the world--whatever, wherever. Holy Land drug wars, that's the ticket.
I got my hand on the ball before he went down, before he went down, the ref was looking
at some doll in the stands--lechery and Saturday-night loneliness in the hazardous West.
Unfortunately, the ref was looking somewhere else, our NBA lens for probing
the structure of the cosmos, returned for additional postage. And I
lent him my lip balm.

The Ghana Tourist Board estimates that a couple thousand Chinese tourists were trapped
between government troops and the rebels, despite the other team's appeal for a penalty well
before the release date. Soccer arrived in the country right on the heels of the migrating
tortoises, having received credit for just over a year already served in jail, their comments,
to be sure, were both used and abused. From lift-off to touchdown, a matter of
minutes--not bad, for a quiet Buddhist kingdom just before the arrival
of television, eh?

Unfortunately, the ref didn't see our tears. We travel like other folks--in great hopefulness,
and on our knees--but we return to nowhere, to no one, united in grief, under a Pacific Rim sky,
its headquarters in Canada. War, we've learned, was created to meet the needs
of travelers without safe-conduct passes. Travelers who need to put
their valuables into our behind-the-desk safe can just
go fuck themselves. And so say all of us.

And what do dictators do? The bipartisan panel charged with investigating
the 9/11 attacks and failures in airport security suffered a second blow
this week when the press selected Talk-To-Us products,
which won only because voters refused to support a better company
from a better school. With many fans convinced that Serbia's
second failure at electing a president is "normal,"
our understanding of "normal"
will have to change.

Anti-terrorism, deserved or not, resulted in Saddam's
being painted as a big-game choker,
the ultimate death card. Americans, meanwhile, hate the press
that blows smoke in their eyes. Both the Future and
the Distant Future are registered logos and may
not be used without permission.

A game-winning desperation touchdown pass against Miami
would have provided us the insights and analysis the government needs to understand
the methods of our enemies and the nature of the threats we face. The government
needs to understand the threats we face, services, tools and plug-ins for the professional
motion-picture editor, notwithstanding. Trees now offer instruction and services,
defoliation expertise. Click here to see how to access the service wirelessly.

Dear Laura Bush:

In your years as school librarian did you ever come
across the poet T.E. Hulme? He was killed, Belgium, 28th
September 1917. I just wanted you to have this little poem of his:

Trenches: St. Eloi

Over the flat slope of St. Eloi
A wide wall of sandbags.
Night,
In the silence desulatory men
Pottering over small fires, cleaning
    their mess-tins;
To and fro, from the lines,
Men walk as on Picadilly,
Making paths in the dark,
Through scattered dead horses,
Over a dead Belgian's belly.

Perhaps, after you read this poem, you might care
to share it with your husband. But, then again, it's
probably hard to shake...isn't it... this notion that
this coming war is against some kind of threat. Difficult,
isn't it, to believe it's just for commercial and territorial
aggrandisement.

Cheers,
Gerald Schwartz

a thoughtless  man (a) ray / a beneficial  barking dog




please stand-by . . . . this could be it

there is a problems with the reception

the way seems to be tumblingdown tumblingdown


no match for the big show...
the big one in a million the one right off the edge of time.



and then . . . .

without warning lights or . . . .

the never  mind story submerses right in my mind . . .

I get caught in deep throated salvation

tall dark and waiting for that shadow show that lives in the heart

small spasmodic dogs are the next
a mimic produces a modern dumb laminal show
at the
fortune tellers convention

phobias without a stake in the the out come


I freeze frame
catch the next train or bus or plan or do a virtual mix-an-match .. one
body part for another..
recycle the rest in a dog-eat-cat-eat-dog-eat-cow-eat-dog-eat-past a
midnight act


the audience hasn't seen the slight of hand

the professor and mary
jesus and mary
tom and jerry
and mary todd

  all in forbidden acts for your pleasure restricted spectrum
a river of vowels
a nickname and never rubs off

dirty little works that leave bite marks



excuse me, says the moment after I give up on transmigration,
transsublimation, transcontinental express restrictive monumental new
age tell-all in one of briefest of brief night fall soup in your eyes I
thought you where my neighbor not my sister . . .

I need some aspirin, the aspens, the air planes to come hone and sing
tonight

where is the little sperm - that midnight express  - the some prefer
blondes syndrome

where is the cat in the hat?
the rockets red glare?
the chair with a bicycle wheel on it?


I slip in some intentions let it dry with a slow intention of sensation
whirl in some tobacco
  fasten my seat belt
give warning
  the sailors are out tonight
with there soft lips fn extra wavy sternums


really I want to be explicit

I want a dial tone I can count on
a tumbling down -  a tumbling down

this is the dirt and this is the dirt on the other end

I am a theorem
a three point hollow rod

and I am in avoidance of mt own state of grace
can some one send me a standup comic
or a stamp

a that is to much but I keep say more more more


and then the door bell

  I get the knock knock joke
and there
before me
a thought of despair
  takes me to the show daddy

lets bomb who ever we please
strip and bend over
I am your master your slave you are mine tonight
stand up sit down
repeat after me

"I am the margins on call"
"I am the indentation before phonemes"
"I am the last dance of Salome"

bold and with out relief you add up my bill
my after all and turn in the after lifes, my to much in the end to
remember
the prissy howdo you do

I did i do I will and this is nothing but an antonymous sunrise
and I am a kernal of reason lost in an ocean of parking lots

poet Alexandra Grilikhes died in her Philadelphia home this last Saturday.
she was editor of AMERICAN WRITING MAGAZINE, and the author of nine books of
poetry, her most recent title SHAMAN BODY:  POEMS NEW & SELECTED.  her
experimental novel YIN FIRE was published by Harrington Park Press.  she was
also a dance and performance art critic and had started the first U.S.
Women's Film Festival in the early 1970s.  for many years she hosted a poetry
radio program on NPR, and taught classes on The Poet As Shaman at The
University of the Arts in Philadelphia.
2 OF HER POEMS:


THE WOUND IN THE MOUTH

This morning I saw your
lips both bitten through,
bleeding.  you were
troubled as if you did not know
how it happened, still couldn't
believe it, surreptitiously licking
the wound.  It reminded me how
most of the time wounds are
hidden you don't know their depth,
how the would itself makes you
burst into tears on the wrong
occasion, how dumb with grief you
are how you will not speak to me
first how you are waiting for me how
I refuse how dumb with grief I am how
wounds are best healed when you
hide in the cave how the ceremony has
meaning you will rise in the ruins
and move towards the thing you most
want you won't know what it is till you
choose feel the wound feel the blood.


MANGLED

I write you
my tongue mangled on your
flowers, flowers that you brought me
from the city, mangled too on
you, your body a green
stone washed ashore at high
tide and still glistening.
You are all I wish for
in the clear light of this early
August day.  The
flowers the brown bottle, wanting to
live and I love their short fragile
lives, their sweetness, their slight
fragrance almost lost here in
the high sea winds.  Yet their outline
sharp against the light, fiercely
grips this room, and continually, my
looking at them.

Frank!

This totally sucks. Tell me more---how did he die? Was he riding his motorcycle?
I loved that guy----met him in '86. Was a great presence at all those pre-"slam" open
mics. "I Hate Art" was always a fav. On a personal level, he was warm generous bridging
the white-black thing as well as various little conflicts. When we ran the warehouse squat
"killtime place" in 89, he (and his motorcycle club, The Wheels of Soul), helped us little
white "anarchists" organize a "Free James Brown" dance party. A really great guy. I'd heard he actually achieved some money success from his visual art in the 90s, and I heard one of his poems on Berkeley radio station last year. I was hoping I'd get to see him again...

Jongleur -- noun -- an itinerant mediaeval entertainer proficient in
juggling, acrobatics, music, and recitation.




"Joglars", French jugglers, were the name given to the singers who moved
castle in castle, course in progress. They were the interpreters of the
troubadours when those could no longer sing their songs themselves. They
were messengers...the creations of these eternal poets. Messengers with the
service of the most powerful lord of this time: LOVE .

It seems in Medieval yore that the "jongleur" had more performing skills
than the "joglars."  I suspect Coolidge is/was primarily interested in
arresting the reader with either sounding out and/or visually participating
in the construction of the word as a catalyst into the way he wanted the
reader to engage the text between the covers. "Joglars" is so unsmooth - in
fact suggests, on one hand (or throat!) the "jugular" as perhaps dangerous &
vulnerable as in "go for the jugular"; or, simultaneously, sounded out, the
two sylables have the same assymetric tonal effect of a drummer striking two
cymbals down on each other as a way of gathering attention at the beginning
of a set.

Harry,

Who was C.H. Ford and what does this slavery nostalgia song or David
Henderson have to do with him or her?  Or with David Henderson or why he
should have been at this memorial?

Just trying to understand your poem; thought I'd just ask you.

(Note, also, the proposed EPA 'revisions'.  This may not be poetry but to
ignore it is at great risk. I suggest - as makers of language - minimally we
reclaim the language theft practiced by this Administration. "High Alert" I
think this phrase - state of mind - characterizes the best of great writing
as well as good citizenship. (Wasn't Frank O'Hara, for example, on "High
Alert." The Bush boys definitely have me - and I imagine most of us - on
"high Alert." Otherwise we currently be at even greater peril. Indeed there
are two wars on terror here - within and without.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats on Monday asked the Justice Department to
explain reports that it plans to ask Congress to expand an anti-terrorism
law to increase surveillance while restricting access to information and
limiting judicial review.

House Judiciary Democrats called on Attorney General John Ashcroft to
explain the existence of a copy of draft legislation called the Domestic
Security Enhancement Act of 2003. The Center for Public Integrity, which
posted the document online Friday, said it had obtained it from a government
source.

Attorney General John Ashcroft said Monday that the Justice Department is
working to figure out "what we can do to be more successful" in the war on
terrorism. "We're going to do that on a daily basis," Ashcroft said.

The new legislation, according to the alleged draft, would prohibit
disclosure of information regarding people detained as terrorist suspects
and prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from distributing
"worst-case scenario" information to the public about a nearby private
company's use of chemicals.

The measure would create a DNA database of "suspected terrorists"; force
suspects to prove why they should be released on bail, rather than have the
prosecution prove why they should be held; and allow the deportation of U.S.
citizens who become members of or help terrorist groups.

For Renee

Light bubbles over
somehow in the tree-branches a
sun is stuck like a kite
deflated. I drink light
dribbles down my chin like
you come hard thinking
your girlfriend is beautiful, may I
have her in mind? I love

the way gravity looks on her
hair shuffled ripe strawberry by
light or grape soda, orange
angel jellies and cake cataract
tassles of her arms blow around me
Eddie, you handfuls of whisper
lung sand take up and dreydle
a bird's salty declaration, hello,

this is morning: eat

I want to add that when I first saw "Joglars" - I forget if it was a mag or
book (maybe a Bill Berkson Blue Sky Press Production in early seventies?) I
thought  "joglars" was some kind of word for "throat" - from the "jugular"
connection from which would emerge a lyric with a twist/ a non-narrative
counter-lyric built on visual sounding of the word and/or syllables within
each word. German scat.

Jongleur -- noun -- an itinerant mediaeval entertainer proficient in
juggling, acrobatics, music, and recitation.




"Joglars", French jugglers, were the name given to the singers who moved
castle in castle, course in progress. They were the interpreters of the
troubadours when those could no longer sing their songs themselves. They
were messengers...the creations of these eternal poets. Messengers with the
service of the most powerful lord of this time: LOVE .

It seems in Medieval yore that the "jongleur" had more performing skills
than the "joglars."  I suspect Coolidge is/was primarily interested in
arresting the reader with either sounding out and/or visually participating
in the construction of the word as a catalyst into the way he wanted the
reader to engage the text between the covers. "Joglars" is so unsmooth - in
fact suggests, on one hand (or throat!) the "jugular" as perhaps dangerous &
vulnerable as in "go for the jugular"; or, simultaneously, sounded out, the
two sylables have the same assymetric tonal effect of a drummer striking two
cymbals down on each other as a way of gathering attention at the beginning
of a set.

Jongleur is twangy imitative Norman for joglar, rap artist in the vigorous
Old Occitan tongue of Arnaut Daniel (Dante's "lengua materna"), also means =
a
trickster.

Langue d'Oeil from the North (where yes is oui) crushed Langue d'Oc (where
yes is oc), and Occitan culture in the thirteenth century, through the
prolonged and horrific Albigensian crusade.  The massacre of civilians in
the church at B=E9ziers is one of history's notorious crimes against humanity=
.

(Occitan was generally spoken in the South until Napoleon instituted
monolingual learning.  You still can hear old people speak it today on
village squares in the Black Mountains.)

And then the French stole their poetry and codified it as a culture (Amour
Courtois) and called themselves jongleurs.  But we owe our lyric existence
to joglars. =20

Small Press Traffic presents the first of our
Spring 2003 New Experiments Events

Saturday, February 15, 2003 at 3:30 PM
New Experiments:
Jim Behrle Forgets His Heroes
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00
$5, free to members
Classroom East 1, CCAC SF Campus, 1111 - 8th St., SF (see website for map)

Jim Behrle writes: "Around September, 2001 did Human Nature change? How late
is it, and what does that mean for the younger generations of poets? Young
American poets are the bastard latchkey children of an overwhelming and
disparate generation. We are the students, acolytes, and banner-carriers for
poets who would like to mold and/or f**k us. Will we remain foot soldiers in
the wars of their mentors? What ought new magazines, presses, reading series
do to be vital? Ought Creative Writing programs exist? Every aspect of trying
to write innovatively in the United States needs to be refreshed. If the
succeeding generations of American poets are to be innovative and exciting,
they must be in spite of the work and advice of the previous generations.To
make it new, it ought to be broken. This discussion centers around the need
for new reigning models, which will place future generations of American
poetry out from under the shadows of their predecessors."

Behrle's latest chapbook is Recent Sonic News (Please evict us, 2002). He
serves as Roving Poet for WBUR's noontime syndicated Public Radio newsmagazine
"Here & Now." Behrle lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he also edits
the online journal can we have our ball back? and serves as the poetry editor
for Pindeldyboz.

New Experiments:
Emerging Patterns in Innovative Literature by Authors Born in the 1960s and
1970s, Elucidated by Themselves
New Experiments, which will continue next spring and beyond, aims to map new
ways of reading, and to put a new generation on those maps.
Join us for Saturdays this season for a special series, curated by Elizabeth
Treadwell Jackson.
In a recent letter to the Poetry Project Newsletter , Boston poet and editor
Jim Behrle made a call to innovative writers of the Baby Boomer (and older)
generation to "give the kids a chance". Small Press Traffic?s New Experiments
series will do just that. New Experiments will explore critical (though not
necessarily academic) ways of understanding writing that is being created now
by younger experimental poets and prose writers. These critical understandings
will be generated by the practitioners themselves in concert with the
presentation of new works by themselves and others.
These writers could be referred to as heirs of Language poetry, New Narrative,
New York School, and other fairly recently established categories, but our
idea is to seek out understandings of how far and wide -- and oddly, randomly,
anarchically through bumpy history -- their inheritances truly go and work. We
are also interested in exploring the contexts in which this writing is made
today, and the contemporary forces that shape it. Small Press Traffic is
interested in maintaining our position as an important venue for the latest in
writing by helping a diverse group of talented and committed poets and writers
under the age of forty-five -- most under thirty-five -- to create new works
and to discuss emerging patterns in the literature of their generation.
We are interested in how political and societal concerns and pop- and other
cultural influences function in the writing of this new generation, the what
and why of their aesthetics, and patterns in same that seem to each of the
invited writers to be appearing. New Experiments is devoted to finding out how
a diverse group of active writers and cultural workers see things; not in
creating new "schools" per se, but in creating new ways of reading and
understanding experimental writing that is happening today.

Harry, I hold no brief for the Poetry Project, but this is horrible lying
bullshit, and you know it. Were you born a jerk, or have you worked hard at
developing your jerkness over the years?

        O, Lorine, if this is
        a love poem it ain't
        to the addressee but
        full moon Louis who
        left you to dry

click send abandoned, no
response but perhaps
the point is too
tangentially asserted:
                        that it is perhaps
        not a love poem but
        a lament, a tiny elegy for
        his sib they (full
moon 'Rine) snuffed.
                        The address
to Paul could sneak it past
Cecelia (not that CZ was notably a gatekeeper but that
Lorine, by nature farouche, would have avoided
confrontation [the poem's trope, at LZ's insistence])
to the one whose sympathy--whose
guilt perhaps whose indictment--she sought.

        O, Louis, may I
        join you among the indited, among
        the guilty, among those
        the poem addresses

                                I too filled her

                                did Shelley and surely

I'm sorry to say that I made a mistake in listing the date of Keith =
Shein and Jono Schneider's reading from their new O Books at City =
Lights. The reading took place on January 21st, whereas I had listed it =
here as February 21st. Fortinately their readings were very good and =
there was a good audience. Schneider's book is: "...BUT I COULDN"T =
SPEAK..." and Shein's books is: RUMORS OF BUILDINGS TO LIVE IN. Both are =
available from SPD (1341 Seventh St Berkeley CA 94710) and O Books (5729 =
Clover Drive, Oakland CA 94618).
    The reason why I made a mistake recording the date was that there =
will be another O Books reading at City Lights on February 20th for the =
anthology ENOUGH. I will describe that in a different osting. Thank you =
-- Leslie Scalapino

Hi everybody, I thought you might like to read this well-researched,
informative and eye-opening article from the Washington Post:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52241-2002Dec29.html

Here are some excerpts that caught my eye:

On Nov. 1, 1983, a senior State Department official, Jonathan T. Howe, told
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that intelligence reports showed that Iraqi
troops were resorting to "almost daily use of CW" against the Iranians. But the
Reagan administration had already committed itself to a large-scale diplomatic
and political overture to Baghdad, culminating in several visits by the
president's recently appointed special envoy to the Middle East, Donald H.
Rumsfeld.

Secret talking points prepared for the first Rumsfeld visit to Baghdad
include[ed] the statement that the United States would regard "any major
reversal of Iraq's fortunes as a strategic defeat for the West." When Rumsfeld
finally met with Hussein on Dec. 20, he told the Iraqi leader that Washington
was ready for a resumption of full diplomatic relations, according to a State
Department report of the conversation. Iraqi leaders later described themselves
as "extremely pleased" with the Rumsfeld visit, which had "elevated U.S.-Iraqi
relations to a new level."

…..

A 1994 investigation by the Senate Banking Committee turned up dozens of
biological agents shipped to Iraq during the mid-'80s under license from the
Commerce Department, including various strains of anthrax, subsequently
identified by the Pentagon as a key component of the Iraqi biological warfare
program. The Commerce Department also approved the export of insecticides to
Iraq, despite widespread suspicions that they were being used for chemical
warfare.

The fact that Iraq was using chemical weapons was hardly a secret. In February
1984, an Iraqi military spokesman effectively acknowledged their use by issuing
a chilling warning to Iran. "The invaders should know that for every harmful
insect, there is an insecticide capable of annihilating it . . . and Iraq
possesses this annihilation insecticide."

….

The U.S. policy of cultivating Hussein as a moderate and reasonable Arab leader
continued right up until he invaded Kuwait in August 1990, documents show. When
the then-U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, April Glaspie, met with Hussein on July
25, 1990, a week before the Iraqi attack on Kuwait, she assured him that Bush
"wanted better and deeper relations," according to an Iraqi transcript of the
conversation. "President Bush is an intelligent man," the ambassador told
Hussein, referring to the father of the current president. "He is not going to
declare an economic war against Iraq."

If the saturday peace march is not be allowed,  we could  all go out with a
white/red sign, a piece of cloth tied to our wrists, or carry
a white/red sign in any other way, so that we would be manifesting
for peace as we go about,  shopping or walking, everywhere and at any
time, both as individuals or in small groups, to avoid the need to
have "a permit" to walk for peace.

pierre: who designed your signature?  it really makes me jealous...  I
spend my life doing things with computers & in 12+ years of having
email I still havent gotten a signature together, let alone something
this classy.  this signature sells books.

There cannot be the slightest doubt that false charges of sodomy are more
numerous than those of rape, and that this is too often a successful mode
of extortion. This is rather a legal than a medical question; but it is
especially deserving of notice, that these accusations are very frequently
made by soldiers and a bad class of policemen!

I have a hunch Jordan means this in the kindest sense possible- like putting
a sick and or crazed animal out of its misery. But why not start a Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to List Subscribers (SPCLS). I myself am
bi-cy, that is, bicybernetic, as I  like both blogs and the list a lot, in
spite of the occasional loose cannons or limp noodles as the case (in every
sense of the word) might be.

Hi---
are there any lonely lurkers, specifically female, say ages 24-42, out there...

maybe wanna talk on phone like late nights (is that even something
people do
here?)
or maybe even be a lake-walking partner (i do that kind of obsessively) in
Oakland.
If so, feel free to backchannel me. You don't have to be a poet; though it's
okay
if you are; it's even okay if you're a "poet scenester". Not necessarily
looking
for sex or a relationship, but am looking for some social warmth on a
one-on-one
basis. Sick of being third wheels with couples; sick of "guy's night
out," sick
of
long distance abstractions---
I've been told that I'm too intense for many,
but feel I actually sort of have something to give....

Anyway, just thought I'd say this if the list is gonna end before the
bombs go
off, etc...

Less a rib & more sig envy.  I read my mail on about 5-6 different
computer in 3 different places, from pop accounts & from the web.  But
I think my point was that these seemingly simple things always escape

In the course of the first few paragraphs I was sure that the author Bottum
had plagiarized the less competent, but equally obtuse, article by his
brother Kimball at the New Criterion.

There are no surprises here. Bottum thinks poetry can and should be
"political" but only if it has the right kind of politics. That is, the
9/11 attacks and Palestinian suicide bombers should move a red-blooded
American poet to write fierce and "competent" political poetry in the line
of Yeats or Auden. All other poets fall, Bill O'Reilly-like, into a sorry
pile of "anti-Americanism," whatever that may mean.

Speaking truth to power is American, but only if it politely retreats
afterward and allows power to get on with its private business transacted
in the public arena: through war. This is elitism at its finest.

At least Bottum has the honesty to admit he's a dabbler in poetry. And as
dabblers go he has an extremely narrow view of poetry (not to mention
politics). Like human lives in the political realm, he sees in poetry (or
recognizes) only the poets who matter. And they are-----the ones who are
signing petitions now and contributing poems to anti-war sites---falling
short of their mark as "serious" poets. To his credit, he refrains from
using the term "decadent."

Bottum (I can't help but want to write "on Shakespeare" after his name)
writes: "Though anti-Zionism, anti-globalism, and anti-Americanism were
building through the 1990s, America's poets showed nothing approaching this
level of protest when President Clinton spoke to the nation from the
Pentagon in February 1998 and brought the United States to the edge of
all-out war with Iraq."

He's absolutely right. As anti-war poem posting becomes fashionable even
among the laureates and Pulitzers, let's not forget that this murderous and
stupid war---that's right, Bottum! "murderous"---is in its 12th year. The
"shock and awe" bombing plan is a repeat performance. The less shocking
(save for those on the receiving end) but still awful weekly bombings in
the Fly-not Zones of Iraq kept up throughout the past decade have not been
the stuff of sonnets and odes. Not even in a magazine like "The Nation,"
tho it did tend to notice the US was still committing acts of war against a
population we were simulatenously killing by blocking the importation of
medicine and mechanical parts to fix desalination plants, etc.

So what's more offensive than Bottum's ranting his mediocre views of poetry
in this country (in addition to making/linking the grievances of the poets
to Mrs. Bush on a personal level) is his defense of the current regime as
being unfairly attacked for wanting to make a good war, while the paper he
writes for waged a relentless campaign against Clinton for enjoying
blowjobs in the oral office. Bottum, like all partisans, cannot see that
Clinton and Bush are two sides of the same coin. They are both disgusting
human beings, and disgraces as presidents. But at least Clinton's
impeachable offenses never got people killed. His actions (via use of
military) certainly did. But Bottum and company don't mind that kind of
thing. What's American power for if not to beat and kill people with your
big stick while softly speaking the nicer stanzas of Whitman's democratic
vistas?

Well, to read Bottum's article all the way through is to see a thumbnail
sketch of a right-winger's cultural prejudices. It's important at the
moment because this kind of narrow mind is widely found in every newspaper
and heard on every radio. But the forces Bottum claims not to understand,
the protesters who see no contradiction in a plethora of messages and signs
from before Seattle '99 to now, will continue to grow and reveal his
argument as without merit.

The Poetry Project/ St. Mark's Church
131 East 10th St. (at 2nd Ave.)
Manhattan
  February 19, Wednesday

Sardonic troubador Nada Gordon's latest book, V. IMP (Faux Press
2003), has been described as "mood-riddled hijinx and impudent lyric
protest" and "nonsense galore, as in a bathhouse." With Gary
Sullivan, she is the author of Swoon (Granary Books 2001), a
nonfiction e-pistolary multiform  novel.  She published two other
books in 2001:  Are Not Our Lowing Heifers Sleeker than Night Swollen
Mushrooms? (Spuyten Duyvil), and Foriegnn Bodie (Detour), a
collection of poems written during her eleven years in Tokyo. With
Gary Sullivan, she edits the Poetry Project Newsletter.  Ongoing
obsessions include song, odalisques, ornament, and all forms of life
IN OPPOSITION TO WAR AND OTHER IDIOCIES. Her more-or-less daily
musings on life and poetics can be found at
http://www.ululate.blogspot.com.



Steve Katz is the author of Creamy & Delicious (Random House, 1970),
the innovative novella, The Lestriad, recently reprinted by Bamberger
Books, and The Exagggerations of Peter Prince (Holt, Rinehart &
Winston, 1968), a Manhattan kind of a book, provincial and puckered
with graphics. His novel, Saw, was published by Alfred Knopf and, as
a Fiction Collective pioneer, he published Moving Parts, a book in
which the author writes an enormous, fantastic story, called Parcel
of Wrists and then keeps a journal as he sets out to live that
fiction. With Leo Garen he co-wrote a film titled Grassland. Cheyenne
River Wild Track emerged from this experience, a book of poems
focussed on making a feature film in South Dakota, quickly followed
by the new and improved Stolen Stories. Sun & Moon Press produced a
threesome of books - Wier & Pouce, Florry of Washington Heights, and
Swanny's Ways - as well as 43 Fiction that included passages from
several of his books as well as new work. Michael Stephens writes on
Moving Parts in the American Book Review "Like Rimbaud, Steve Katz
was formed of ice and polar nights, and as always he is much alive,
hurt and hurting, loved and loving, a contentious knight of Hope out
to do battle with the toothless electronic Dragon of Commerce."

Platform
by Rodrigo Toscano

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on April 15, 2003
of _Platform _ by Rodrigo Toscano. www.atelos.org/platform.htm

About the book:
        Rodrigo Toscano's _Platform _ is a political one; his writings
are predicated on the political conditions of contemporary life. But his
work is not (and will never be) predicted by those conditions; indeed,
outwitting, unnerving, and outspeaking the forces and figures clinging
to control is one of his signal artistic strategies. It would be correct
to read Platform as a triumphant product of precise and complex labor
(thus adding to the tradition set by of Louis Zukofsky). But where the
spirit of Johann Sebastian Bach informed Zukofsky's work, we would
suggest that it is the spirit of the Teatro Campesino that informs
Toscano's -- his poems carry out brilliantly creative interventions. The
works is bitingly inventive and yet delicately meticulous; outrageous,
funny, anti-hypocritical, and "unfuckingrightgaggable," Platform is
victory for the political intelligence whose exercise is now, more than
ever, a human necessity.

About the author:
        Rodrigo Toscano grew up in San Diego. After a few years in the
San Francisco Bay Area working as a social worker and an activist within
the labor movement, he moved to New York, where he continues this work.
He is a nationally influential writer, whose work along the
intersections of social and aesthetic activism is adding new dimensions
to contemporary poetics.

_Platform _ is Rodrigo Toscano's third book. His first book, The
_Disparities_, was published jointly by Green Integer and O Books in
2002. His second book, _Partisans_ (which, due to a variety of
circumstances, came out before his first), was published in 1999 by O
Books.

About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of the nonprofit
foundation Hip's Road. Atelos is devoted to publishing, under the sign
of poetry, writing which challenges the conventional definitions of
poetry. All the works published as part of the Atelos project are
commissioned specifically for it, and each is involved in some way with
crossing traditional genre boundaries, including, for example, those
that would separate theory from practice, poetry from prose, essay from
drama, the visual image from the verbal, the literary from the
non-literary, and so forth. The Atelos project when complete will
consist of 50 volumes; Platform is volume 15. The project directors and
editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis Ortiz; the editor for cover
production and design is by Ree Katrak.
 Ordering information:
        _Platform _ may be ordered from Small Press Distribution, 1341
Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA 94710-1403; phone 510-524-1668 or toll-free

Dear friends:

http://www.resonancefm.com.

The series features innovative radio producers, sound poets and audio
artists in conversation and performance: Gregory Whitehead, Stephen
Erickson, Jennifer & Kevin McCoy, cris cheek, Charles Bernstein, John
Oswald, Bob Cobbing, Christof Migone, Michael Basinski, Sianed Jones, Piers
Plowright, Paul D. Miller (a.k.a DJ Spooky), Lawrence Upton, Bufffluxus and
Jane Draycott & Elizabeth James. It also contains nifty little voice bumpers
from the likes of Allen Weiss, Kersten Glandien, Lauren Goodlad, Mark
Percival, Himan Brown, Tim Crook, Matthew Finch, Kenneth Goldsmith, David
Chesworth, Sonia Leber, Simon Elmes and Jo Tacchi; plus oringial music by

A website is in development at the EPC where I'll post news of subsequent

Martin

Note on Hsun Tzu


"By saying, 'There are no names necessarily appropriate of themselves,'
Hsun Tzu means that at the time when names were first invented, a certain
name was used to indicate a certain thing according to the free will of
those who made these designations. For example, men agreed with one
another that they would call a dog by the word 'dog,' yet at the beginning
they might just as conceivably have agreed upon the word 'horse' to
designate it. When these designations had once been agreed upon, however,
so that people used a certain name to indicate only that certain thing,
this became customary. Thereupon names and the things they designated had
their necessary appropriateness, one to the other, and could no longer be
changed at pleasure. Even when the names were first being made, however,
at the time when 'there were no names necessarily appropriate of
themselves,' there were nevertheless some that were 'especially
felicitous.' Names which could be readily pronounced, for example, would
be more felicitous than difficult sounding names." (from A History of
Chinese Philosophy, Fung Yu-Lan, 1952) - Saussure two millennia early.
But what is missing is the institutionalization of names - for example,
who or what declares the 'Axis of Evil'? The distortion of names is the
reification of an empathetic magic in which earlier designations resonate
with later; the result is a population, ourselves, unsure of any meaning
whatsoever, or even if meaning is ever applicable - perhaps it is nothing
more than an operator, a function ...

Lovely stuff on names.  There is a whole section in Proust devoted to the
topic.  And though this has little to do with names per se, Emerson says in
"The Poet," "every word was once a poem."

  stuff on names

liquid burns away a hard morning dust
a single syllable of permissible lies count's bodies and change

objects in walls
talking heads and slippery tongues

a slight of hand and puff of smoke dazzles us
engulfs our ignorance in hermit crab resilience

a doors shut
lips are sealed

either you're part of the song
or accumulating benefits for the dead

the method is progress
the foliage plastic

a letter is written
ashes returned

the label says
reread instructions / failed inspection

another calls: "I am going to kill myself . . .?
"we have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 a.m."

Last week NPR featured a report from North Korean in which an English
speaking journalist gave account of two air raid drills each day - with the
whole populous running for air raid shelters with sirens going off, etc. The
N K message was the drills are practice for an eminent USA bombing attack.
The reporter's interpreted the reoccurring drills as one of the means by
which the military dictatorship maintains maximum control and manipulation
of its citizens.

Two days later, the USA goes on "High Alert." Within the last week FBI and
CIA Director's are before the Senate prophesying terror attacks are eminent
and public, military and civil agencies are called upon to be vigilant.
Instead of running into an air raid cellar, we are encouraged to by duct
tape to seal gas out of our houses.

Isn't it curious that these Alerts are being raised simultaneous with the
impending siege of Iraq? The eminent UN vote. And, maybe most importantly,
just this week, before what will be massive International and domestic
demonstrations against a decision to go to war. I personally have no doubt
that the Alerts - and the attendant collective apprehension created by these
warnings - are designed to neutralize, or, one might say, are one of the
Bush regimes means to put duct tape around the mouth of public opposition.
(O yes, inevitably they will arrest somebody who they say was caught just in
time before going to do x).

I guess it is not surprising how old scripts become re-familiar.

What will be surprising - and fulfilling - is if global and domestic
opposition to this colonial charge to "own Iraq"  is successful.  (If you
want to get good creeps, I suggest reading, if you have not, the Lehman
article on the real White House ideology behind an Iraq  invasion and USA
futures in the Mid-East  in the New Yorker this week - it's readable on the
NY web site. Clue: it's got minimal to do with WMD, Al-Queda, etc. )

Call my reps daily, send the rice, and walk this weekend. As with Gloria
Frym's reference to "to a poem at the birth of every word",  why not this,
too. Otherwise, I sense a lot of real darkness coming.

um, dag...I took a real "whatever" attitude on this, as I had reached my
weekly threshhold, but...

Renee Gladman has been teaching a creative writing workshop there for the
past six weeks, fyi.

As a former Dark Room Collective member, I know that many of us (DR people,
that is) have had a presence there over the years.

Didn't Deborah Richards read there, too?

Erin Lambert | Five Poems


Erin Lambert is a graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University and worked
for several years at a homeless shelter in Richmond before moving on to
complete an MFA in creative writing at Syracuse University. She now
resides in Queens and works for a non-profit education organization in
Manhattan. Her work has appeared in Spectrum, Canadian Woman Studies
Journal, and is forthcoming in Fine Madness.


At Last

A woman stands, wanting sleep; her face
vague as the bottom of a bottle, means
to say: not at all happy, not entirely unkind.

Sunlight on half her hair, long and under: dark circles
around eyes that lead to a breadline in Leningrad.
As if this photo of an inconsolable crowd, viewed
through a shot-out window, cannot offer us enough.

I made the woman up, thought she would distract us
from that windowsill with breadcrumbs,
that window full of flies
dead among the rivets and last catch of light in nails.


Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

I'm looking for alice notley's essay "what can be learned from dreams" (an
approximate title?) which if I recall correctly appeared in Scarlet Fall
1991.  I've done some searching but haven't had any luck.  Please send any
suggestions offline.  thanks, mm

This apropos to Laura & Dungya Bush -- from an interview with John O'Brien,
the truly amazing "genius" behind Dalkey, at
http://www.centerforbookculture.org/pages/aboutus.html

"In relation to the idea of the subversive, I do have a very conscious
sense in selecting a book for publication that this is an author who is
saying something that people don't want to hear--that it will make them
feel uncomfortable, even if they love the book. I agree with the view that
the Russian Formalists held in the early part of the twentieth century that
art alters perceptions and that those altered perceptions can have a rather
direct impact on how perceptions are altered elsewhere, the most obvious
being in the political realm. For the Formalists, conventional art
reenforced the status quo everywhere within a society, which is reassuring
for those with power. But art that makes one see things differently can
easily affect how people see the world around them and then begin to
question institutions of power. This is why dictators tend to be so quick
to silence the artists; they understand the subversive nature of art."

 Yeah, yeah, all well and good, but what happened to the limp noodles? Don't
they make you cogitate also? Aren't you nervous when there are no limp
noodles around in a crowd of poets? No couples for them, then? No preferring
more than just one limp noodle? What happened to BEGGING all limp noodles to

"Get Your Kicks On Route 666"
by George "Dubya" Bush,

& Leader of the Free World(TM)



If you ever plan to invade the east
Travel my way, take the highway of the beast.

(Madman hicks on Route 666.)

It winds from Washington to Baghdad
More than 6,000 miles spreading dismay.

(Murder fix on Route 666.)

You destroy Mandali, Mosul, Ramadi,
And Kuwait City will smell mighty shitty.
You'll bomb Al-Hindiyah, Zakoh, As Samawah
Salman, Al Muthanna, don't forget Zubayir
Tikrit, Arbil, Ad Dinwaniyah.

Won't you pack your clip for this deadly scrip
When you take that C-17 trip?

The essay is in fact not in THE SCARLET CABINET (Scarlet Editions, NY
1992) which reprints only (in terms of essays) her "Homer's Art" first
published as "Curriculum of the Soul" pamphlet #9 from  The Institute
of Further Studies (Canton NY 1990). I have not been able to locate in
any of my AN books -- & would also be happy to know where it is.

and the Russian formalists. We can only imagine anyone in Washington
'defamiliarizing' any act of war...

"Tolstoy makes the familiar seem strange by not naming the familiar object. He
describes an object as if he were seeing it for the first time, an event as if
it were happening for the first time. In describing something he avoids the
accepted names of its parts and instead names corresponding parts of other
objects. For example in 'Shame' Tolstoy 'defamiliarizes' the idea of flogging
this way: 'to strip people who have broken the law, to hurl them to the floor,
and to rap on their bottoms with switches...' Then he [Tolstoy] remarks:

'Just why precisely this stupid, savage means of causing pain and not any
other--why not prick the shoulders of any part of the body with needles,
squeeze the hands or the feet in a vise, or anything like that?'

...The familiar act of flogging is made unfamiliar both by the description and
by the proposal to change its form without changing its nature."


from "Art as Technique"

Meanwhile, the poster of the "Not Fir for the White House" anti-war

Center came in electronically -- here is the url:

Below another grating  piece by Eliot Weinberger also in the morning,
critizising NION & the event:

From: Eliot Weinberger <unreal@worldnet.att.net>

To: (Recipient list suppressed)
Subject: Lincoln Center

I was shocked when I read that orchestra seats to the "Poems Not Fit for
the White House" event at Lincoln Center were $100; then I became
curious
to "follow the money." Various poets invited to participate whom I
contacted knew almost nothing about the details.

The event is sponsored and organized by Not In Our Name (NION) which has
been running a statement in newspapers, signed by many well-known people
and some 4000 "others." The statement is ill-written, verbose, and keeps
veering off the issues at hand, but was notable as probably the first
such
advertised petition to appear widely.

NION, which previously did not exist, was founded by people connected to
two largely interchangeable (in their personnel) groups: Refuse & Resist
and the Revolutionary Communist Party. R & R, which began in the 80's,
for
some years has mainly been dedicated to the Mumia Abu-Jamal case. The
RCP
is a Maoist group, supporters of the Shining Path in Peru and lately the
guerrillas in Nepal. Tax-deductible contributions to NION are made to
the
Bill of Rights Foundation: its sole activity for the last three years
(expenses of $100,000 a year) has been to pay the legal bills for Mumia.

As was the case in the Vietnam War, it often happens that the initial
demonstrations and antiwar activity are run by fringe groups, who have
the
organizational skills and the dedicated followers. Then the movement
spreads into a mainstream of coalitions of grassroots organizations.
This
appears to be the case again: The initial push coming from International
Answer and other groups with sometimes bizarre agendas has now expanded
into a national and international movement.

The Lincoln Center event is a benefit for NION. The money (according to
them) will go to pay for more ads with the NION statement.

The NION statement has already appeared widely. Is it necessary for it
to
be replicated forever? That there is something creepy, possibly cultish,
about this replication becomes apparent when one goes to the NION
website
(www.nion.us) and sees the "Pledge of Resistance" which is meant to be
recited in unison by large groups.

The money will go entirely to pay Lincoln Center (NYC's symbol of
corporate-sponsored art) for the hall and the media conglomerates to pay
for the ads. The money will not be given to any humanitarian
organization
or spent on any humanitarian cause, such as medical supplies for Iraqi
children.

The event is a microcosm of Bush America: The rich ($100 seats) are near
the action and the powerful on stage, the poorer ($10 seats) are far
off in
the balconies, and the very poor (for example, inner city high school
kids
who should be present, as they are the ones who will be "volunteered"
into
this war) are excluded entirely.

The idea of a gathering of Famous Writers is to create publicity for the
cause. This is an idealistic misunderstanding of news as it now exists
in
the US. There may or may not be an article in the arts section of the NY
Times, but the event will not be reported by the mass media: there's
nothing "newsworthy" about poets reading poems. (Unless, of course, J-Lo
and Ben show up.) The protest against Laura Bush's Poetry Tea became an
international sensation not because 5000 poets were against the war, but
because it was an embarrassment to Laura Bush.

All events against the war and the Bush domestic policies are worthy. It
is, however, seriously questionable whether it is worthwhile to have a
poetry event in the style and expense of a Manhattan charity fundraiser
solely to benefit the perpetuation of NION and its statement.

COMMENTARY
A Dreadful Act II
Secret proposals in Ashcroft's anti-terror war strike yet another blow at
fundamental rights

By Jack M. Balkin

February 13, 2003

Just as the Bush administration is preparing a preemptive strike on Iraq,
its Justice Department has been preparing yet another preemptive strike --
a new assault on our civil liberties.

For months, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and his staff have been secretly
drafting the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, designed to expand
even further the new government powers for domestic surveillance created by
the 2001 USA Patriot Act. Justice Department officials have repeatedly
denied the existence of the draft bill, dubbed the "Patriot Act II," but a
copy leaked out recently and has been posted on a Web site, www.public
integrity.org.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, the government has rounded up hundreds of people in
secret and refused to disclose even their names, on the spurious grounds
that this protects their privacy. As drafted, the measure would remove
existing protections under the Freedom of Information Act, making it easier
for the government to hide whom it is holding and why, and preventing the
public from ever obtaining embarrassing information about government
overreaching.

Another section would nullify existing consent decrees against state law
enforcement agencies that prevent the agencies from spying on individuals
and organizations. These consent decrees were crafted because state and
local governments illegally invaded the privacy of American citizens and
repeatedly violated their civil rights. To make matters worse, the proposed
bill prevents courts from issuing injunctions to block future abuses.

Perhaps the most troubling section would strip U.S. citizenship from anyone
who gives "material support" to any group that the attorney general
designates as a terrorist organization. Citizenship is the most basic right
for all Americans, one from which other rights -- such as the right to
vote, to participate in politics and even to live in this country -- all
flow. Under our Constitution, Americans can't be deprived of their
citizenship, and the rights that go with it, unless they voluntarily give
it up.

The measure would get around that constitutional guarantee through a legal
loophole. It presumes that anyone who provides "material support" to an
organization on the attorney general's blacklist -- even if that support is
otherwise lawful -- has intended to relinquish citizenship and therefore
may be immediately expatriated.

The McCarthy era demonstrated that the attorney general could wield
enormous power to harass innocent Americans by designating legal
organizations as subversive. The proposed act creates a similar danger:
Give a few dollars to a Muslim charity Ashcroft thinks is a terrorist
organization and you could be on the next plane out of this country.

The Bush administration claimed last year that the original Patriot Act
gave it the tools it needed to fight the war on terror at a minimal cost to
civil liberties. These new proposals show, however, that the administration
still is not satisfied. It now seems clear that there is no civil right --
even the precious right of citizenship -- that this administration will not
abuse to secure ever-greater control over American life. The Bush
administration and Ashcroft have become addicted to secrecy and are drunk
on power; the more they obtain, they more they demand.

We are fortunate that these proposals came to light now. Otherwise, the
administration probably would have revealed them only after it began its
war with Iraq, when political opposition would be inhibited by support for
our troops. The proposals would not help our war with Iraq, but they would
help our government cover up its mistakes.

It is frightening to think that our leaders would try to undermine our
civil liberties through a cynical manipulation of public opinion in time of
war. It would be even more frightening if they succeeded.

This is an insightful bit of investigation that's really worth thinking
about.  Thanks.  I agree about how poorly written the NION statement is.

By US Senator Robert Byrd
D-West Virginia
Senate Floor Speech
Wednesday, February 12, 2003

To contemplate war is to think about the most horrible of human experiences.
On this February day, as this nation stands at the brink of battle, every
American on some level must be contemplating the horrors of war.

Yet, this Chamber is, for the most part, silent -- ominously, dreadfully
silent. There is no debate, no discussion, no attempt to lay out for the
nation the pros and cons of this particular war. There is nothing.

We stand passively mute in the United States Senate, paralyzed by our own
uncertainty, seemingly stunned by the sheer turmoil of events. Only on the
editorial pages of our newspapers is there much substantive discussion of
the prudence or imprudence of engaging in this particular war.

And this is no small conflagration we contemplate. This is no simple attempt
to defang a villain. No. This coming battle, if it materializes, represents
a turning point in U.S. foreign policy and possibly a turning point in the
recent history of the world.

This nation is about to embark upon the first test of a revolutionary
doctrine applied in an extraordinary way at an unfortunate time. The
doctrine of preemption -- the idea that the United States or any other
nation can legitimately attack a nation that is not imminently threatening
but may be threatening in the future -- is a radical new twist on the
traditional idea of self defense. It appears to be in contravention of
international law and the UN Charter. And it is being tested at a time of
world-wide terrorism, making many countries around the globe wonder if they
will soon be on our -- or some other nation's -- hit list. High level
Administration figures recently refused to take nuclear weapons off of the
table when discussing a possible attack against Iraq. What could be more
destabilizing and unwise than this type of uncertainty, particularly in a
world where globalism has tied the vital economic and security interests of
many nations so closely together? There are huge
cracks emerging in our time-honored alliances, and U.S. intentions are
suddenly subject to damaging worldwide speculation. Anti-Americanism based
on mistrust, misinformation, suspicion, and alarming rhetoric from U.S.
leaders is fracturing the once solid alliance against global terrorism which
existed after September 11.

Here at home, people are warned of imminent terrorist attacks with little
guidance as to when or where such attacks might occur. Family members are
being called to active military duty, with no idea of the duration of their
stay or what horrors they may face. Communities are being left with less
than adequate police and fire protection. Other essential services are also
short-staffed. The mood of the nation is grim. The economy is stumbling.
Fuel prices are rising and may soon spike higher.

This Administration, now in power for a little over two years, must be
judged on its record. I believe that that record is dismal.

In that scant two years, this Administration has squandered a large
projected surplus of some $5.6 trillion over the next decade and taken us to
projected deficits as far as the eye can see. This Administration's domestic
policy has put many of our states in dire financial condition, under funding
scores of essential programs for our people. This Administration has
fostered policies which have slowed economic growth. This Administration has
ignored urgent matters such as the crisis in health care for our elderly.
This Administration has been slow to provide adequate funding for homeland
security. This Administration has been reluctant to better protect our long
and porous borders.

In foreign policy, this Administration has failed to find Osama bin Laden.
In fact, just yesterday we heard from him again marshaling his forces and
urging them to kill. This Administration has split traditional alliances,
possibly crippling, for all time, International order-keeping entities like
the United Nations and NATO. This Administration has called into question
the traditional worldwide perception of the United States as
well-intentioned, peacekeeper. This Administration has turned the patient
art of diplomacy into threats, labeling, and name calling of the sort that
reflects quite poorly on the intelligence and sensitivity of our leaders,
and which will have consequences for years to come.

Calling heads of state pygmies, labeling whole countries as evil,
denigrating powerful European allies as irrelevant -- these types of crude
insensitivities can do our great nation no good. We may have massive
military might, but we cannot fight a global war on terrorism alone. We need
the cooperation and friendship of our time-honored allies as well as the
newer found friends whom we can attract with our wealth. Our awesome
military machine will do us little good if we suffer another devastating
attack on our homeland which severely damages our economy. Our military
manpower is already stretched thin and we will need the augmenting support
of those nations who can supply troop strength, not just sign letters
cheering us on.

The war in Afghanistan has cost us $37 billion so far, yet there is evidence
that terrorism may already be starting to regain its hold in that region. We
have not found bin Laden, and unless we secure the peace in Afghanistan, the
dark dens of terrorism may yet again flourish in that remote and devastated
land.

Pakistan as well is at risk of destabilizing forces. This Administration has
not finished the first war against terrorism and yet it is eager to embark
on another conflict with perils much greater than those in Afghanistan. Is
our attention span that short? Have we not learned that after winning the
war one must always secure the peace?

And yet we hear little about the aftermath of war in Iraq. In the absence of
plans, speculation abroad is rife. Will we seize Iraq's oil fields, becoming
an occupying power which controls the price and supply of that nation's oil
for the foreseeable future? To whom do we propose to hand the reigns of
power after Saddam Hussein?

Will our war inflame the Muslim world resulting in devastating attacks on
Israel? Will Israel retaliate with its own nuclear arsenal? Will the
Jordanian and Saudi Arabian governments be toppled by radicals, bolstered by
Iran which has much closer ties to terrorism than Iraq?

Could a disruption of the world's oil supply lead to a world-wide recession?
Has our senselessly bellicose language and our callous disregard of the
interests and opinions of other nations increased the global race to join
the nuclear club and made proliferation an even more lucrative practice for
nations which need the income?

In only the space of two short years this reckless and arrogant
Administration has initiated policies which may reap disastrous consequences
for years.

One can understand the anger and shock of any President after the savage
attacks of September 11. One can appreciate the frustration of having only a
shadow to chase and an amorphous, fleeting enemy on which it is nearly
impossible to exact retribution.

But to turn one's frustration and anger into the kind of extremely
destabilizing and dangerous foreign policy debacle that the world is
currently witnessing is inexcusable from any Administration charged with the
awesome power and responsibility of guiding the destiny of the greatest
superpower on the planet. Frankly many of the pronouncements made by this
Administration are outrageous. There is no other word.

Yet this chamber is hauntingly silent. On what is possibly the eve of
horrific infliction of death and destruction on the population of the nation
of Iraq -- a population, I might add, of which over 50% is under age 15 --
this chamber is silent. On what is possibly only days before we send
thousands of our own citizens to face unimagined horrors of chemical and
biological warfare -- this chamber is silent. On the eve of what could
possibly be a vicious terrorist attack in retaliation for our attack on
Iraq, it is business as usual in the United States Senate.

We are truly "sleepwalking through history." In my heart of hearts I pray
that this great nation and its good and trusting citizens are not in for a
rudest of awakenings.

To engage in war is always to pick a wild card. And war must always be a
last resort, not a first choice. I truly must question the judgment of any
President who can say that a massive unprovoked military attack on a nation
which is over 50% children is "in the highest moral traditions of our
country". This war is not necessary at this time. Pressure appears to be
having a good result in Iraq. Our mistake was to put ourselves in a corner
so quickly. Our challenge is to now find a graceful way out of a box of our
own making. Perhaps there is still a way if we allow more time.

In going through boxes (& boxes & boxes) of books & records that have
been in storage for 3 years, I just happened to open one that
contained the first 20 or so Talismans this morning. The essay that
Michael is looking for is NOT in the Notley issue.

We had a wonderful anti-war reading at Modern Times Bookstore last night.
Donations were asked for a local artist activist web site in development.
Taylor Brady can provide details - if his one free hand is able to type (he
broke the other arm in the service of Art)- or maybe there is some one else?
About 60 people (in a day full of other readings in the Bay Area). Spirited,
sometimes sober, sometimes hilarious, and good - a nice dose of Iraqi modern
poems - new born little duet poetry playlets and various poem takes on Bush,
the nature of the media, and some inevitable questioning of the relationship
between the art of protest and the art of art.  (It will be interesting to
see in what ways poets revisit the questions Barry Watten has raised about
Denise Levertov during People's Park  -  a poetry of individual
consciousness versus a poetry of socio- political questioning with activist
consequences. How and where the two poles integrate with power (and against
another power).)

There are some who will seize any kind of divisiveness or simply difference
of opinions to paralyze the will to take witness against and oppose the Bush
people. I guess that's why the tone of Eliot W's piece comes off as counter
productive to moving things forward.
Every org will inevitably make self-serving tactical mistakes. But the
greater opposition will drown those and open up other opportunities.

I don't think anybody believes any one party or group is in control of this
opposition. The sense of growing public terror (this morning they are
proposing the revival of nuclear bomb tests and use) is so great, multiple
leaders have begun to abound. There is plenty of room for rich, and
inevitably temporary coalitions - and, if you ain't a joiner - it's still
possible and maybe inviting to grow your own opposition.

Otherwise we going to owning even more darkness.

This piece is in Scarlet No. 5, published Sept. 1991.

Scarlet was a magazine co-edited by Alice Notley and Douglas Oliver. The
Scarlet Cabinet was produced after five issues of the magazine had been
printed, and contains three books each by Oliver and Notley.

And for what it's worth, Notley and Oliver then went on to publish Gare du
Nord after they moved to Paris -- also five issues.

February 13, 2003


Remember, in the week before Valentine's Day, these moments leading up to
the war:

Colin Powell offers evidence to the UN of Saddam Hussein's perfidy that
would force Condoleezza Rice to bring Powell up on charges of plagiarism
before an academic tribunal.

Laura Bush cancels her celebration of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and
Langston Hughes because poems protesting her husband's war-mongering might
be read. In the past, poets questioned their role in American life, but now
they are scorned and insulted by war-ideologues for vanity and irrelevance,
and they relish their new role as fools. Who had thought anyone cared?

Reporters in the Kurdish controlled part of Iraq are shown the secret
warfare factory displayed in Powell's aerial photograph. Nothing can be
seen but ruins.

The Department of Homeland Security advises plastic sheeting and duct tape,
and there's a run on the stores.

American Idol and Joe Millionaire and the other entertainments conduct
their contests with the proper lack of dignity.

A pregnant mother from Modesto remains missing, her husband still eyed with
suspicion.

Israel makes plans to invade Gaza, and another eight-year old boy is shot
dead in the West Bank.

China is declared a future threat because of arms build-up, while Iran's
nuclear research, observed long ago, is re-observed, a bookmark for the
next war.

Germany and France and Belgium are scorned like poets.

North Korea declares the right to pre-emptive strike if America threatens
to invade, tearing a leaf from Bush's book.

Plans are made to "shock" Iraq with such massive bombardment its army will
surrender from sheer dismay after one or two days.

Osama bin Laden denounces America on al-Jazeera Network, calls for Iraq to
resist, even though Saddam Hussein is a bad Muslim. Colin Powell declares
that this is proof of terrorist collaboration between Iraq and al Qaeda.
The rest of the world scratches its head.

A federal appeals court decides that an insane man on Death Row should be
forced to take anti-psychotic medication to make him sane in order for him
to be sane enough to be executed.

Alan Greenspan, oracle of markets, gingerly questions Bush's tax cuts, and
a Senator tells him to shut up.

I keep getting mountains of spam asking me if I want a bigger penis.

The word is out that the U.S. military will be ready to launch their attack
by the beginning of March.

The manned space station twirling around the earth turns out to be nothing
more than an excuse to keep the Space Shuttle program in business.

A significant amount of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN on Iraq's
"weapons of mass destruction" is pasted together from magazine articles,
much like a sixth-grade report copied from the encyclopedia.

Saddam Hussein is still a dictator. No one in the world needs Colin Powell
or Donald Rumsfeld to remind us.

The Bush Administration deems it fine to cut more timber on national forest
land.

Israel keeps stealing Palestinian land. Someone needs to tell Colin Powell
and Donald Rumsfeld.

People hate their cell phone companies for providing erratic service and
hidden costs and price rigging. Consumer Reports labels them the most hated
companies in American business, but the Bush administration refuses to
regulate them.

New York City authorities restrict the movements of peace marchers.

Members of Congress call for the resumption of nuclear testing.

Don't forget to buy Hershey's Kisses.

Pilgrims circle Mecca for the Hajj, and someone interviewed on the street
in San Jose for TV says this makes her scared.

Remember these moments before the war with a bemused grin. After the war,
we will recall them with shame.

CIA Kills Cupid;
Business Analysts Concerned

2003-02-13 10:45:00

ATHENS (AP)

A CIA-operated unmanned drone launched an attack on love Tuesday morning,
killing Cupid and three other unidentified demi-gods. The pre-dawn raid
took place on the slopes of Mount Olympus, site of the 1999 US-led
invasion which attempted to eliminate the Gods in their immemorial redoubt.

"Cupid was a serious hindrance in the war on terror," said U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell in a statement today. "We have led the world in
recognizing his bow and arrows as weapons of mass destruction."

The capricious archer has been a thorn in Washington's side since US
President George W. Bush declared a moratorium on "unclean relations."
"We can't have Palestinians falling head over heels in love with Jews, or
Arabs with Christians. What kind of a world would we have on our hands
then? Historically, such unnatural alliances have needlessly muddied
foreign policy. The poets tell us what mayhem the little bastard's darts
have wreaked upon the innocent. Just look at Romeo and Juliet."

Officials described the attack as a preemptive strike. With Valentine's
Day looming and the war in the Gulf in its final stages of preparation,
the prospect of irrational outbursts of tender feelings was troubling to
the hawks in Washington.

"The War on Terror is also a defense of family values," stated Bush.  "We
can't forget that. I won't have America's children held hostage by some
Grecian sniper."

"Venus is next," Bush added. "Your days are numbered, slut."

Zeus was quick to issue a statement indicting the American attack. "This
is purely genocidal aggression against a powerless and isolated race of
immortals. Bush continues to insist that we harbor weapons of mass
destruction. But we have been perfectly compliant with the ongoing arms
inspections. We have no thunderbolts. Vulcan's forge was dismantled by UN
inspectors and it remains that way."

Meanwhile, business analysts at home have expressed concern. Ted Smith, a
spokesman for Hallmark Cards, addressed worries about the effect the
attack would have on the multi-million dollar Valentine's Day industry.
"Our shareholders have nothing to fear. The Pentagon has assured us that
they are working with Disney to manufacture a family-oriented replacement
for Cupid. The new one will reflect the decent, rational values that every
American can identify with. For us, this is an opportunity to clean up
Valentine's Day. To get rid of all that sex."

"We feel that the American public needs a little friendly pressure to keep
it on the right track. We want to ensure that whatever carnal relations do
exist in this country are no longer discussed in public, except when they
concern certain liberal elected representatives. Sex, sadly, is a
necessary evil intended solely for procreation, so our national holidays
should have the beneficial effect of reinforcing the association between
Christian values and compulsive consumption. If a few perverts feel
ostracized because they don't share these values, or if a few losers can't
keep their marriage together or get a date, that's their problem."

MONDAY FEBRUARY 17 [8:00pm]
FALL WORKSHOP READING
Participants from the four Fall Writing Workshops of Renee Gladman, Janet
Hamill, Kristin Prevallet, and Anne Waldman, will read from their work.

WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 19 [8:00pm]
NADA GORDON AND STEVE KATZ
Nada Gordon is the author of V. IMP. (just out from Faux Press), Swoon (wit=
h
Gary Sullivan), Are Not Our Lowing Heifers Sleeker than Night-Swollen
Mushrooms?, and Foriegnn Bodie. With Gary Sullivan, she edits the Poetry
Project Newsletter. Her more-or-less daily musings on life and poetics can
be found at http://ululate.blogspot.com.

Steve Katz is the author of Creamy & Delicious (Random House, 1970), The
Lestriad, recently reprinted by Bamberger Books, and The Exagggerations of
Peter Prince (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1968). His novel, Saw, was publishe=
d
by Alfred Knopf and, as a Fiction Collective pioneer, he published Moving
Parts, a book in which the author writes an enormous, fantastic story,
called Parcel of Wrists and then keeps a journal as he sets out to live tha=
t
fiction. With Leo Garen he co-wrote the film Grassland. Cheyenne River Wild
Track emerged from this experience, a book of poems focused on making a
feature film in South Dakota, quickly followed by the new and improved
Stolen Stories. Sun & Moon Press produced a threesome of books =8B Wier &
Pouce, Florry of Washington Heights, and Swanny's Ways =8B as well as 43
Fictions that included passages from several of his books as well as new
work. Michael Stephens writes on Moving Parts in the American Book Review,
"like Rimbaud, Steve Katz was formed of ice and polar nights, and as always
he is much alive, hurt and hurting, loved and loving, a contentious knight
of Hope out to do battle with the toothless electronic Dragon of Commerce."

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 21 [10:30pm]
POETS ON THE PEAKS
An event with John Suiter, author/photographer of Poets on the Peaks: Gary
Snyder, Philip Whalen & Jack Kerouac in the North Cascades. John Suiter is =
a
Boston-based freelance photographer and writer whose work has appeared in
numerous national and international magazines over the last ten years. He
lives and works in Boston, where he is an instructor at the New England
School of Photography. Poets on the Peaks is both a literary group portrait
of Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen centered around their
experiences as fire lookouts in the early 1950s, and a photographic homage
to the North Cascades landscape. The book features 54 photographs =8B mostly
B&W, Duotone photographs of the peaks =8B taken by John Suiter, and also
several historical photos, some of which have never before been published.
Based on scores of previously unpublished letters, journals, and recent
interviews with Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and others, Poets on the Peaks
is about the development of a community of poets, including the famous Six
Gallery reading of October 1955. It contains cameos by fellow poets and
mountain-climbers Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth, Philip Lamantia and
Michael McClure. It is also a book about Dharma and the years of Dharma
Bums, from the 1951 roadside revelation in the Nevada desert that led Gary
Snyder to drop out of academia and head for Japan, to Kerouac's
lonely vigil with The Diamond Sutra on Desolation Peak, to Philip Whalen's
ordination as a Zen priest. Finally, Poets on the Peaks is the story of the
birth of a wilderness ethic. Transcending many of the tired clich=E9s of the
Beat life, it tells how the solitary mountain adventures of three young
writers helped to form the literary, spiritual, and environmental values of
a generation. Anthony Brandt of National Geographic Adventure notes: "A
fresh, engaging chronicle of a gateway period in American cultural life, th=
e
rise of the Beats. . . . The book works best not as a chronicle, although i=
t
does that well, nor as a set of mini-biographies but as a reminder that the
twin of the active life is the contemplative one." Read Michael Rothenberg'=
s
wonderful interview with John Suiter (and take a look at some of his
photographs) in Big Bridge: http://www.bigbridge.org/fictsuiter.htm

so, what are you going to do? march on the sidewalk or not? Gary
Sullivan made a pretty heated call for respect of diversity of
aesthetics but what about diversity of tactics?

i realize that NYC is no the kind of place you want to be chucking rocks
at cops but is anyone willing to get arrested for an act of civil
disobedience?

I don't mean this to poke anyone in the eyes or to challenge anyone to a
game of activist street cred one-upmanship. I'm just wonderin what the
thinking is down there.

We were shown

slight variations in radio
microwave haze--

history of the universe --
from its first seconds --
that sizzling soup of

--with a sky ribboned with

race of puzzled
(moreover, puzzling),
ambitious bipeds whose

                        words
prolong unending acts
of our own birth; by
virtue of our immersion
in the world, as great waters
of matter may, without
even a ripple, endure
life.            Was just thinking this
as my five year old asked:
If there's war, does that mean
evolution has to begin
again?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The Seattle Research Institute Presents

"Between Indulgence and Denial:  An Experimental Theology Pre-release
Reading"

When: 7:00, February 25, 2003

Where: The Richard Hugo House, 1634 Eleventh Avenue, Seattle, WA

Who: Rebecca Brown, Lesley Hazleton and Robert Corbett will read from work
to be published in the Seattle Research Institute's Public Text 0.2,
Experimental Theology, due out early April.

Why:  We assert that the midpoint between St. Valentine's Day (the most
pagan Christian holiday) and Lent (the most ascetic) should be observed.
This midpoint, between the celebration of desire and its repression, seems
a particularly appropriate one in these times of decadence and renewed
Puritanism.

There will be a $3 donation.

Biographies:

Rebecca Brown is the author of numerous fictions published in the US and
abroad including The Dogs: A Modern Bestiary and The Terrible Girls, both
with City Lights, and The Gifts Of The Body and What Keeps Me Here, both
with HarperCollins.  Her next collection, The End Of Youth will be
published by City Lights in May 2003.  She has recently written a play,
The Toaster, on commission from New City Theater in Seattle.

Robert Corbett is finishing graduate work on romantic irony and abjection.
His academic work has appeared in Romanticism on the Net and in many
bucolic conference settings.

Lesley Hazleton lived in Jerusalem for thirteen years, where she worked as
a psychologist and a writer.  Writing won out.  Her 'Middle-East' books
include the award-winning Jerusalem, Jerusalem and Where Mountains Roar,
as well as the forthcoming biography of the Virgin Mary.  Since she wanted
to be a nun when she was ten and a rabbi when she was forty, writing a
biography of the Virgin Mary seemed the perfect solution.  The book is due
out Spring 2004 from Bloomsbury USA.

this obit focuses on her work as a librarian, which is strange to me, since she never talked about that at all.  which means i learned a thing or two about her i hadn't known much about, but she talked about poetry nearly every and any time you'd see her.  poetry is what i remember.

i've been rereading her work, of course, and wanted to share my favorite poem she wrote titled EMBLEM, but it's in her book THE BLUE SCAR, which i can't find right now.  damn.  anyway, let me share a couple more of her remarkable poems:

-------------

THE REVERIES

those
where our mouths
clasp and we're
overcome me continually
in the midst of important
matters

                    Off in the Caribbean sky
                    I'm taking a breath
                    taking dive over the beautiful
                    cliff and the
flower soaks through me I
fantasize terrific
longings in color
       spending it all you
       becoming fruit in my
veins soaking through I
hit water
swimming      for      life

-------------

VACATION

death came to me drunk
wearing a new white island outfit
she'd bought that day.  The men
on the road called us cunts.
"This is my dream place," she breathed,
"I feel so alive here.  Fuck me on this
bench."  On the half-lit porch,
the watchman taking a midnight nap
around the bend, I did as I was
told for a long time thinking I'd
please death this time at last.  Later
she rolled away and in the morning
rose early and left.  I bought
death many presents.  She bought me rags.

Public call for contributions towards


the 50th Anniversary presentation of John Cage's Williams Mix
Larry Austin's Williams [re]Mix[...stallation]
to be presented at Engine 27, NYC in March 2003




Engine 27 and composer Larry Austin invite all composers, musicians and
practitioners of electroacoustic and computer music, sonic art, New
Music, New Media, and sound design to participate, via the web, in the
Williams [re]Mix[...stallation]: a 50th Anniversary Celebration of John
Cage's Williams Mix.

Public call for sounds: city; country; electronic; manually produced;
wind produced; small, which need to be amplified. Call ends midnight,
March 16, 2003.

Go to http://engine27.org/williamsmix.html to upload your sound files,
for more information and for a brief history of Williams Mix.

Saturday, March 22, 2003, marks the 50th anniversary of the premiere
performance of John Cage's Williams Mix (1951-53) for eight monaural
magnetic tapes, the first octophonic tape music composition in the
world, created and performed with eight speakers surrounding the
audience. To celebrate this historic piece and its first performance 50
years ago, Austin will create the Williams [re]Mix[...stallation], a
continuously performing octophonic sound installation to be installed at
Engine 27, implemented with Austin's recently developed Williams
[re]Mix[er] (1997-2001), an interactive I Ching composing program. The
program, in operation, creates ever-newer versions and realizations of
Cage's original work, calling on a recorded sound library of hundreds of
sounds. The program's functionality is modeled on the compositional
processes used by Cage to create his Williams Mix, these processes
extrapolated and applied from Austin's analyses of Cage's 192-page
score, his sketches, and the eight monaural, analog tapes for the piece.

Since first starting the project, Austin has continued to collect sounds
for the recorded library of sounds (ranging from 20 to 120 seconds each)
according to Cage's six sound categories of city (A), country (B),
electronic (C), manually produced (D), wind produced (E), and small
sounds (F).


From February 14 to March 16, 2003, everyone is invited to upload
soundfiles, via the web for inclusion in the library to be used during
the new multiple Williams [re]Mix[ed] realizations to be played during
the installation.


Guidelines for contributing sounds



1. Sounds should be contributed as stereo, 44.1K, 16bit, aiff or wave
format soundfiles.
2. Sounds should be from 20 to 120 seconds in duration.
3. Each soundfile sent should be labeled by the contributor and placed
in the correct folder or directory according to Cage's categories of
city (A), country (B), electronic (C), manually produced (D), wind
produced (E), and/or small sounds, which need to be ampified (F) and
include the author's name or 'tag' and a number signifying how many
files you've contributed to the category. The contributor decides which
category the sound(s) belong(s) in.
4. Go to: http://engine27.org/williamsmix.html


Engine 27's Williams [re]Mix[...stallation] presentation dates: Saturday
& Sunday, 2-8pm, March 22, 23, 29, 30
opening reception: Saturday, March 22, 6-8pm, address: 173 Franklin St.
(btwn. Hudson & Greenwich)

In 5040 (1280 C.E.), Kabbalist Rabbi Abraham Abulafia received a vision
urging him to publicly condemn the notoriously anti-Semitic Pope Nicholas
III. Abulafia proclaimed his intention to speak in person to the Pope and
travelled to Rome. The Roman rabbis branded Abulafia a heretic and made a
joint accusation with the Christian authorities. The Pope rapidly ordered
Abulafia burned at the stake. When he arrived at the gates of Rome, Abulafi=
a
was warned that he had been sentenced to  imprisonment and death, and the
firewood was prepared for the next morning. It was the eve of Rosh
Hashannah, the beginning of the New Year and the High Holy Days. Untroubled=
,
Abulafia spent the night meditating a few miles from the city. In the
morning, as he passed through the city gates, Abulafia was informed that th=
e
Pope had died during the night, leaving the Church leadership divided and
preoccupied with its internal power struggle. Abulafia entered the city and
the Franciscan prison that had been prepared for him. He was released 28
days later.

=B3The letters are without any doubt the root of all wisdom and knowledge, an=
d
they are themselves the contents of prophecy, and they appear in the
prophetic vision as though opaque bodies speaking to man face to face sayin=
g
most of the intellective comprehensions thought in the heart of the one
speaking them. And they appear as if pure living angels are moving them
about and teaching them to man, who turns them about in the form of wheels
in the air, flying with their wings, and they are spirit within spirit.=B2
-Abraham Abulafia

Find strength in our very powerlessness. Permutate the letters and split th=
e
names.

Yes, the Big Bang.  Thank you for the addition.  Please, keep adding
more.  It's like accumulating the artifacts for an archeological dig even
before we're all buried.

Me, I'll be sticking to the sidewalks, and I will encourage all my fellow
resident aliens to do the same. I fear that an arrest would mean rapid
deportation, and I'm not anxious to be forced to leave a city I've called
home for over ten years.

Had I got around to becoming a citizen, however, I would be tempted to take
to the middle of the street -after- the rally, if it seemed there were a
significant number of others so inclined. I don't think the pre-rally
feeder marches should push the issue -- we need bulk at the place assigned,
where we will likely be penned up like hogs -- but afterwards the
unconstitutional ban on marching ought to be contested, and I'm absolutely
sure it will be.

Wednesday, February 13, 4:15, 2003I need everything; I need an end to
this.I need nothing; I need a beginning to This.Somewhere when i am worn
out and have nothing left to lose, i call on my lover, and she comes;
there is smoke in the air - grenades, mortars, screams of the dying and
wounded, the two of i collapse together, as one, you're both safe for the
moment -Thousands die everywhere around us; we're alone, there's a single
bright spot in the sky...We're breathing for our own deaths - we're
exhausted, frightened, Maria's pregnant... I crawl towards her, I'm
wounded, bleeding, we're together now, forever, together at last... We're
crying, we can't say anything. Weeping for language, weeping for ourselves
- we promise everything to each other - we give everything to each other -
We make our final vows - we wait for the end - it's almost here - it's
coming -Our final vows - without language, in silence - there am no others
-We're silent - we can't hear you - don't say anything else - it's time
for - it's time for nothing at all - silence, once again, we suppose,
we're sleeping, the baby...

Now everything gone, inscription after the fact, our epitaphs, our ruined
lives...

While I believe civil disobedience is an extremely
powerful political tactic when planned as part of a
comprehensive strategy (i.e. when Gandhi had the
Indian workers approach the Salt Mill gates precisely
because he knew they would get beat down and because
he knew the press were present and would report back
to the English public) I'm not sure I believe in
walking in the street and being taken into lock-up,
ticketed for "parading without a license" and release
seven hours later, tired and cranky (yes it's happened
to me before).

So I think I'll go the sidewalk route, unless it
becomes apparent that mass arrests become part of the
march strategy.

Subject:      Essays Needed for Book
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Contributors are needed to write short essays (ranging from 500 to 2000
words) on these topics (the list below is revised since my last posting):

David Antin (500 words)
Caribbean Poetic Influences (2000 words)
Pat Mora (500 words)
New York School (2000 words)
Vikram Seth (500 words).

The essays are for a volume entitled A Companion to Twentieth-Century
American Poetry (to be published in June 2004 by Facts on File, Inc., a
publisher that enjoys very wide distribution in libraries, colleges and high
schools, as well as bookstores).

Payment for essays will be in presentational offprints and, too, for the
large topic essays, a copy of the book. All essays will carry the author's
name, and a list of contributors will appear in the back of the book.

The entire list of entries for the volume can be viewed at this website:
http://eies.njit.edu/~kimmelma/companion.html; also at the website can be
found a set of guidelines for writing the essays as well as sample, model
essays.

Essays are due by this spring.

If you are interested in writing for this book, then please send a message
to Kimmelman@njit.edu, using the subject header Essays for Book (or else
simply reply to this message). Please provide a bit of background about
yourself including a brief account of your publishing history if you have
one (do not send an attached cv or samples of writing).

I hope to hear from you!

I'm reasonably sure that I don't agree with some of the fundamental

Words without Meaning
Christopher Gauker

According to the received view of linguistic communication, the primary
function of language is to enable speakers to reveal the propositional
contents of their thoughts to hearers. Speakers are able to do this
because
they share with their hearers an understanding of the meanings of words.
Christopher Gauker rejects this conception of language, arguing that it
Rests on an untenable conception of mental representation and yields a
wrong
account of the norms of discourse.

Gauker's alternative starts with the observation that conversations have
goals and that the best way to achieve these goals depends on the
circumstances under which the conversation takes place. These goals and
circumstances determine a context of utterance quite apart from the
attitudes of the interlocutors. The fundamental norms of discourse are
formulated in terms of the conditions under which sentences are
assertible in such contexts.

Words without Meaning contains original solutions to a wide array of
outstanding problems in the philosophy of language, including the logic
of
quantification, the logic of conditionals, the semantic paradoxes, the
nature of presupposition and implicature, and the nature and attribution
of
beliefs.

Christopher Gauker is Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Cincinnati.

Senate Remarks: The Administration's Dangerous Wartime Rhetoric
Made on 13 February 2002
By Senator Robert C. Byrd, D-WV

         The language of diplomacy is imbued with courtesy and discretion.
Diplomats the world over can be counted on to choose each word of every
public statement with precision, for an ill-received demarche could turn
allies into adversaries or cooperation into confrontation.

Like most professions, diplomacy has its own lexicon. As John Kenneth
Galbraith wrote in 1969, "There are few ironclad rules of diplomacy but to
one there is no exception: when an official reports that talks were useful,
it can safely be concluded that nothing was accomplished." And when we hear
a seasoned envoy refer to a "frank and open discussion," we know that he is
actually talking about a knock-down, drag-out fight behind closed doors.
While negotiation can steer great powers away from a course that would lead
to war, we can usually count on public statements about diplomacy to be
underwhelming.

There have been exceptional times when bold statements have energized world
opinion. When President Reagan stood on the Berlin Wall in 1987 and
proclaimed, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall," he spoke to millions of
Germans who longed to be freed from oppression. While I would not go so far
as to credit a single phrase with hastening the fall of the Eastern Bloc,
certainly President Reagan's statement reflected the resolve of the West to
oppose communism.

There have also been a fair number of bold statements to the world that
have backfired.

For example, Nikita Khrushchev squandered whatever credit he might have
gained through a goodwill tour of the United States in 1959, when he
visited the United Nations the next year. The Soviet Premier famously
exclaimed to the West, "We will bury you," while slamming his shoe on the
table in front of him. This ill-advised outburst was a vivid depiction of
an irrational and out of control superpower.

Fortunately, the United States has a tradition in foreign policy of being
slow to anger. We have nurtured a reputation of being rational and
deliberate. I doubt that Americans would have much tolerance for a
president who used the United Nations as a forum for testing the
construction of his footwear on the nearest table. It would be a great
departure for the United States to use its foreign policy organs as a means
to spread divisive rhetoric.

Unfortunately, the tone of our foreign policy in recent months has been in
a steady decline. To some of our allies, the United States, through its
words and its actions on the crisis in Iraq, is beginning to look more like
a rogue superpower than the leader of the free world. Many newspapers in
European capitals criticize U.S. policy toward Iraq. Moderate Muslim
nations, such as Jordan and Turkey, are growing progressively suspicious of
American motives in the war against terrorism. An increasing number of
people in Arab countries are coalescing around an outright hatred of the
United States.

Let us remember that President Bush came to office promising to change the
tone in Washington. I wonder if the current tone of American foreign policy
is what he had in mind? One source of alarm is the tone of the National
Security Strategy released by the White House in September 2002. In broad
strokes, the strategy argues that the United States should use its
overwhelming military power to engage in preemptive strikes to prevent
others from ever developing the means to threaten our country. The strategy
notes a preference for working with allies to keep the peace, but
underscores the willingness of the United States to act unilaterally.

The content and the tone of these important pronouncements in the National
Security Strategy sparked outcry, in the United States and around the
world. The report gave critics plenty of ammunition to make their case that
the United States is a 400 pound gorilla that will stop at nothing to get
its way. Our strategy leaves much of the world the impression that
Americans agree with the quotation of the late Chinese leader, Zhou Enlai,
which turned the axiom uttered by the military strategist Carl von
Clausewitz on his head: "All diplomacy is a continuation of war by other
means."

There are many examples of provocative rhetoric that have escalated the
stakes of our standoff with Iraq. In his 2002 State of the Union Address,
the President coined an "Axis of Evil," comprised of Iran, Iraq, and North
Korea. In October 2002, the White House Press Secretary suggested that
regime change in Iraq could be accomplished with "the cost of one bullet."
On December 30, 2002, President Bush said that Saddam's "day of reckoning
is coming." The next day, he chided a reporter who asked about the prospect
of war in Iraq by saying, "I'm the person who gets to decide, not you." The
President's coarse words did nothing to ease criticism of American
unilateralism.

Several members of the President's national security team warned Iraq in
January 2003 that "time is running out" for Iraq, and that such time was
measured in weeks, not months. On Sunday talk show interviews on January
29, the White House Chief of Staff refused to rule out the use of nuclear
weapons in a war against Iraq. On February 6, President Bush ominously
declared that "the game is over." With each of these statements, the
chances of war appeared to grow.

To be fair, the President and his advisors have repeatedly stated a
preference for the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. But as I speak right now,
many Americans believe that war is inevitable. Through words and through
action, the United States appears to be on a collision course with war in
the Persian Gulf. Stating a preference for a peaceful solution is not
enough to alter the heading of our great ship of state.

If our rhetoric toward Iraq is not alarming enough, the last weeks have
seen an appalling increase in criticism of our allies and the United Nations.

On September 12, 2002, President Bush delivered a strong and effective
speech that urged the United Nations to take action to disarm Iraq. The
President said: "All the world now faces a test, and the United Nations
[faces] a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council resolutions
to be honored and enforced, or cast aside without consequence? Will the
United Nations serve the purpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?"

The President threw down the gauntlet, and the United Nations acted.
Inspectors have returned to Iraq, and they are doing their job. The
inspectors have asked for more time, but the President has now challenged
the U.N. to authorize the use of force, or again face irrelevance. The
world is now wondering, which is the greater threat to the relevance of the
U.N.: a rogue nation that flaunts the will of the international community;
or a permanent member of the Security Council that views the institution as
useless unless it submits to its will? This hand has been overplayed. More
threats of U.N. irrelevance will only portray the United States as a bully
superpower.

European allies who do not share our view on the crisis in Iraq have
recently been in the cross hairs for verbal bombardment. Secretary Rumsfeld
has lumped Germany in with Libya and Cuba as the principal opponents of war
in Iraq. He also characterized Germany and France as being "Old Europe," as
if their economic and political power does not matter as compared to the
number of Eastern countries that comprise New Europe.

Richard Perle, a senior advisor to the Department of Defense, has also had
choice words about our European allies. In October 2002, Mr. Perle
recommended that German Chancellor Schroeder resign in order to improve
relations between our two countries. On January 30, Mr. Perle followed up
this charge by saying: "Germany has become irrelevant. And it is not easy
for a German chancellor to lead his country into irrelevance." Spreading
his criticism around, Mr. Perle stated that "France is no longer the ally
that it once was." So far as I can tell from press reports, Mr. Perle, who
is the Chairman of the Defense Policy Board, has not been admonished for
his inflammatory statements.

Such vindictive criticism of our European allies has had repercussions.
According to a new poll, published in the Financial Times Deutchland on
February 10, 57 percent of Germans agree with the statement, "The United
States is a nation of warmongers." And now we find ourselves in a pointless
stalemate with our NATO partners over military assistance for Turkey. If we
had been more temperate in our rhetoric, perhaps we could have worked
through the anti-American tone of the recent elections in Germany. Instead,
we find ourselves escalating a war of words against two great European powers.

How we communicate our foreign policy makes a difference. We expect North
Korea or Iraq to use inflammatory propaganda to speak to the world, but we
are a more dignified nation. There are ways for our country to indicate
resolve without resorting to bellicosity. The subtext to nearly every new
White House statement on Iraq is that the United States has run out of
patience. The Administration is signaling its willingness to use an extreme
amount of military force against Iraq when many still question the need to
do so. We need to change our tone.

Impetuous rhetoric has added fuel to the crisis with Iraq and strained our
alliances. Before committing our nation to war with Iraq and the years of
occupation that will surely follow, we should repair the damage to our
relations with our allies. I urge the President to change the tone of our
foreign policy -- to turn away from threatening Iraq with war, away from
insulting our friends and allies, away from threatening the United Nations
with irrelevance. Our rhetoric has gone over the top, from giving an
indication of our strength to giving an indication of recklessness.

I have learned from fifty years in Congress that it is unwise to insult
one's adversaries, for tomorrow you may be in need of an ally. There will
come the day when we will seek the assistance of those European allies with
which we are now feuding. But serious rifts are threatening our close
relationship with some of the great powers of Western Europe. The Secretary
of State said yesterday that NATO is at risk of breaking up. It is time to
put our bluster and swagger away for the time being. I urge the President
to calm his rhetoric, repair our alliances, and slow the charge to war.

I.      the car

in a car     driving     toward a wall
who's driving what car toward what wall what make is the car
          who's at the wheel
it is a 1957 Chevrolet with a license having a repeating decimal
why dont we have the sense to realize
who has the wheel
why do we think somebody has the wheel
does anybody think somebody has the wheel
is there a wheel
there are at least four of them     turning
driving in a car     on a road     toward a wall
waving a sword to keep off pedestrians
our signals are blinking
there is a road and a wall
it is more like falling
nobody thinks anybody has the wheel
in a falling elevator
though there is a road and a wall
that is     a floor
but there is also a cable
and there are doors
we might get out of one of the doors
it is falling toward a wall
who has the wheel
whoever has the wheel
push the button     the stop button or the alarm button or
                            at least push the test button
i want to get out
whoever is driving
what makes you think somebody's driving
in a car     driving
toward a hospital
in a W.C. Fields movie     he yanks the wheel out of the floor
and hands it to a backseat driver
we are all backseat drivers
looking out of the windshield over the front seat
i can't see the back of the driver's head

Be patient sending to these addresses. I sent an email earlier to all the
ambassadors, and quite a few bounced back. When I re-sent, most finally
made it. Evidently they are being flooded.

Dear Friends,
If you get this on Valentine's Day and are looking for great music, party,
relaxed fun, drop by the Club tonight. Raquay Danziger's got two sets at 8 &
9:30 -- her twelve piece band covers the world and guarantees liftoff; the
Tribe of Djembe follows at midnight, funk and world, "Wear Red Please." We
know what that means! (We do?)

Sat., 2/15 leads off at 2pm with Jazz in the Afternoon, mellow sounds of
Shu-ni Tsou on ditzi (Chinese flute) and James McKinney on keys ($8). Segue
presents two young hotshots, David Cameron and Joanna Furman at 4 ($4), and
then a special Frank O'Hara Happy Hour that will last to the amazing
Infusion, our biggest monthly party, with live hip hop poetry, art, and
(ahem) a free beer (Sam Adams) (10pm, $5).
Sun 2/16 2pm: Shakespeare in Harlem, the glorious poetry of Langston Hughes
(every Sunday at 2 in Black History Month, $15). World of Poetry presents
Basque poetry at 5: Kirmen Uribe, translations read by Elizabeth Macklin,
Mikel Urdangarin on guitar ($5). At 8 it's time for Westside Rhyme,
poetry-music-mayhem in the fast lane -- read your own, hear the New. Shawn
Randall and Karen Rockower, hosts ($5).
Mon 2/17 Will this be the thrilling conclusion of WCW's Paterson? Laura
Willey invites you to find out -- and pick out the next epic read. Mac
Wellman will lead Dixon Place in Exile: Experiments & Disordersat 7:30, da
Bips will improvise at 9, and Janice Girlbomb Earlbaum  and Sarah Fisch host
their series &quot;LIT!&quot; at 10 -- Anne Elliott's on this week, hooray!
All these events are part of Bob Holman's Monday Free4All.
Tues 2/18 Will Stephan Smith's The Bell become the Protest Song that Stops
the War? Pete Seeger thinks so. The release party for the CD will start at
7:30 -- it's free, and Stephan will perform. And at 9, the greatest living
metaphor of Freedom of Speech, Rick "Ride the Butterfly" Shapiro will blast
($12). Beau Sia's Whatever follows -- this series of great music, great
poetry, gret chill vibe-aroonie, is the perfect way to cap off the night ($5,
dj till 2am).
Wed 2/19 Tune up your guitar at 7:30 for the Songwriters Syndrome ($5) -
Fernando Ferrer de Borincua is featured. The amazing jazz stylist Judi
Silvano will bring us the poetry of Leanne Averbach in a rare appearance at
10 ($10).
Thur 2/20 Our weekly Urbana Slam rocks at 7:30 -- Mike Henry of Austin is the
Honored Guest Po. ($5) A new po-band from upstate, Galuminum Foil, will play
at 10:30 ($5), and then Rick Shapiro will riff till he drops (lat week: 3.5
hours!) ($12).
AMIRI BARAKA!  and his Word Ship FUNKLORE!  Next weekend , Fri-Sat-Sun --

I wanted to thank Anastasios and Jerome Rothenberg for passing around the
two latest Robert Byrd speeches.

Despite his past mistakes, I've always loved Senator Byrd. He is one of the
last great rhetors in Congress, and will be missed when he's gone. My
favorite recent moment of Byrd's is, when after many Democrats joined with
the Republicans in granting President Bush force authority in Iraq, Byrd
opened one of his more wending Emersonian harangues with the words:
"Fie upon the Congress. Fie upon this Congress."
I was so moved by both the directness and anachronism of the statement...it
said so much about where we are now as a nation, where the individual itself
is so often made made to be the anachronism, the exception. So I made that
quote the opening quote of one of my own collections of poems, The Coward
Ecumenical.
"Fie upon the Congress" --- Sen. Robert C Byrd

Thanks again,
Andrew

Dare I ask  if the shame

COWARDICE, or even TREASON?

The enclosed recently swam to the surface of my mind and my harddisk.  What
struck me at the time was the interesting view on the art from a poet's
perspective (still does, actually) and I was disappointed to find out from
John that it hasn't been printed or blogged or webbed.  perhaps there is a
home for an edited version at EPC, ELO, trace, or rhizome?  In any event, it
is worth sharing for John's comment that "I find it harder and harder to
keep track of everything i don't do" which I share and am planning on
stealing.

tom bell

blimey tom, never answered this. I'm very sorry. I am what I believe you
Americans refer to as slammed.
Nope, this was never 'published' anywhere except where it was published.
I find it harder and harder to keep track of everything i don't do,
all best wishes, John


were these comments ever 'published' anywhere, John?

Subject: epoetry 2001 - brief remarks


apologies for crossposting

briefest ? of remarks offered as a personal attempt to outline what I
consider particularly significant about this important and truly delightful
festival.

first again high paise and deep gratitude to Loss Peque-o Glazier without
whom. Note that proper-paradoxically, by single-tracking a huge confluence
of live datastreams he achieved a miracle of Lossless compression,
distinctly in contrast to more the more Lossy codecs of most conferences,
including the subsequent DAC (digital arts and culture) conference the
following weekend in Brown University (more on that later). Anyway ....

history: at last, in the field of what I call literal art in networked and
programmable media (phew: henceforth NPM, but there is as yet no easier way
to say it), we are beginning to see the wider emergence of historically
grounded contexts informing what have hitherto -- all too often -- had the
character of detached, naive-autonomous essays in the so-called new. The
presence of Philippe Bootz representing the configuration of poets and
programmers around *aLire*, the earliest all-electronic publication devoted
to writing in NPM (1989-) was crucial. *aLire* has a tradition, related to
but distinct from the ALAMO (computer assisted offshoot of the OuLiPo, most
prominent practitioner perhaps, Jean-Pierre Balpe). And I suspect this group
is also the earliest to have a developed sense and theory of 'poesie animZe'
which now plays as Concrete-inflected webbed-up textual Flash movies. And
although there are many others of us throughout the world working in Flash
(or Director or Flash-like things), doing so with a background in, amongst
others, Concrete, Dada, Constructivist graphics, Lettrism, etc. etc. (Flash
animators who have read and practiced some part of what Johanna Drucker's
read and practiced) we still don't have a history of animated text written
by a poet or critic of poetry. (Or do we? Please let me know.) This would
discover -- beyond the flipbook -- cinematic titling and proto-cinematic
titling as the originator of the mode and would trace it into and relate it
to animated text in advertising. The only book I've used on this is (the
impossibly over-designed so as to be almost unreadable) Bellantoni and
Woolman *Type in Motion: Innovations in Digital Graphics* London: Thames and
Hudson, 1999. (Saul Bass!!; Pablo Ferro); but maybe -- in a 'Digital
Culture' context -- Lev Manovich's *The Language of New Media* (MIT Press,
just out and I've just bought it) will have something to say on this or
provide leads .... Generally, we still have a long and necessary way to go
in relating our practice to media history. So on to ...

practice: here, for me, the most exciting development which I believe we are
currently witnessing is the transition to writing in NPM which is
practitioner-led rather than formal-experimenter or media-experimenter-led.
The already-poets and already-writers have tooled up and developed a sense
of what they can do, what they desire to do, what they do not desire to do.
Of course this actually began to happen some time ago, but efforts in this
direction have been -- perhaps with the exception of Kenny Goldsmith and
cohort's invaluable ubuweb (eUbu for the contemporary genuinely NPM stuff?)
which has been visible since its inception -- somewhat obscured by eFluff.
Brian Stefan's 'The Dream Life of Letters' (performed at the conference and
much-appreciated) is on ubuweb -- a tour de force; even a little depressing,
since its going to be hard to think of 2D text-and-graphic figures which
Brian hasn't done. Perhaps that's the point. We begin to stop trying to
think of new things to do and start trying to sort out which of the figures
might be regularly useful for our own practices and projects. (Maybe Brian
could suggest some that he particularly likes and maybe even give them
names?)

I probably should have sited the strong Brazilian contingent at ePoetry
before Brian since they are likely to be his 'anticipatory plagiarists' (I'm
not being rude, its an jocund OuLiPian term -- look it up; you'll have fun
doing so). Great stuff from Wilton Azevedo, who also read for the late
Philadelpho Menezes, and from Lucio Agra. Hot tip of an iceberg which seems
to me also to be better contextualized than animated poetry in the
English-speaking world.

Separate practice thread: I was also encouraged to see and hear that there
is new engagement with what I refer to as programmatological work; writing
in which the programmability of the writing media is a necessity. Amongst
the poets, and outside the chance-fearing OuLiPo, there are programmers who
can distinguish trivial manipulations of language from investigative and
generative procedures which address its structure and the abyss. Neil
Hennessey and Jabber; Darren Wershler-Henry & Bill Kennedy and their
apostrohe engine; Glazier's early-in-the-way Jonathan Minton; Glazier
himself. But all of them (Glazier except since he's written the history) are
somewhat decontextualize and we are still far from having these facilities
built into our word processors (whereas graphic and sound artists do have
the equivalent filters and modulators built into their tools).

In his *Open Letter* article 'Reflections on Cyberpoetry' (Number 9, Fall
2000, pp. 22-33), Brian Stefans opens with a quotation from Roger Pellet:
"The greatest cyberpoem would be an online application that provided you
with an interesting text and a robust interface with which to manipulate it.
In other words, a word-processor." Well yes, we can see where this is going
and the requisite perspective which it lends to the discussion, but MS Word
has never provided me with an interesting text or a robust interface (cf.
BBEdit) or any interesting tools to manipulate whatever text *I've* provided
for it (or plagiarized by anticipation). Maybe Photoshop or Flash are a
vizPo cyberpoems?

Under this thread, its also necessary to mention one of the best critcal
contributions to the conference, by Katherine Parrish, who provided
excellent materials for and analysis of precisely the history and
contextualization of writing in NPM, while heading for the further
textonomic quadrant of live collaborative writing (mixed with
programmatological intervention by e.g. MooLiBots) in MOOSpace.

Inevitably, I dwell on practices which, while not the same, are closely
related to certain of my own, but I also have to signal quite distinct
threads in ....

social literal art and literal art as gaming and (later I'll come to)
literal art as playable/performable instruments: ... not only because they
are, like, 'happening'. In gaming, in intercourse, 'rule modification is
inherently social' (based on the speaker's remarks during a paper by Jesper
Juul at the later DAC conference). This is one of those brilliant but
obvious statements which has important consequences, for any notion of the
avant-garde for one thing. It's hard to make a playable, configurable
avant-garde game or social intertext because the avant-gardist tends to
change the rules without telling anyone, or only telling 'his'
(invidiously/historically) friends, or with the intention of concealing the
rule changes (so that they are more disruptive?!?) or in the hope that later
(after-the-avant) critics will work out the clever changes that 'he'
(invidiously/historically) has made so that said avant-gardist gets to
retire to Olympus or the Academy. This is, perhaps, a good personal
strategy, but in this media it ain't going nowhere, since, it seems, in
practice, many aspects of the media are inherently social. For me, this
raises the happy prospect of no-compromise poetics which play out in the
social and therefore escape the seductions of avant-garde elistism. Ububoys
beware. You are great forces, and the Torontonians amongst you also come
from an important contextualized and localized tradtion, but you've got to
go opensource and join the f***ing community. On the other hand, I'm going
to resist and exclude myself also for as long as possible, but others out
there: M&M And & Damon; Alan Sondheim; the Albany configuration (which might
perhaps check out audience-response protocals when high art keeps calling
after time); but especially the general sense that work is nearly always
being made *in collaboration*. Reiner Strasser's turnaround times seem to be
particularly impressive and productive.

net/web art connections: Another major Brazilian contribution came from
Giselle Beiguelman, linking from the practices I've already mentioned, this
work was - with that of Alan Sondheim - also 'our' chief connection to the
world of 'net art' or 'web art'. These practices are widespread but hard
(for me anyway) to characterize or pin down, except to observe that they
seem to ally more with visual and performance art than with literal or
literary art. Nonetheless, they are often text-based, but in a manner which
is strangely willfully? autonomous from traditions (including avant-garde
traditions) of poetic practice. We definitely need more cross-over here, and
Giselle was our link at this festival. Follow it.

performance: (Excuse errors please. I'm racing to scribble this and get it
off before having to go back to my saltmine.) Finally a word on performance.
We will not be able to get away from the issue of performance in this type
of work. Off the page, the time-based aspects of literal art are more
difficult to bracket in both actual performance and actual criticism. Text
as space; as an instantiation of a spatial engagement with language (even as
time passes) is one thing (and perhaps an inalienable aspect of the
literal), but as consumed or performed, literal objects in networked and
prorgammable media move and morph and translate and transliterate and
interrelate and change in time. As such, practice and theory necessarily
extend beyond 'configuration for the sake of interpretation' (art-making) to
'interpretation for the sake of configuration' (gaming). These formulation
are based on an excellent paper at the later DAC conference by Markku
Eskelinen on the theory of games (in the context of literal art). We are
used to understanding that there are (literal) art objects and that there
are also games and social/intertextual spaces which may have literary
qualitities, but we now also need to develop a 'vocabulary' of a range of
transitional objects which display and modulated time-based media and which,
perhaps, are more like (musical) instruments: they may have an art built-in
and are interpretable as such, but this interpretation is done so that they
can be configured or 'played'. For some practitioners the playing, the
playing-well will be the goal of engagement with such objects. For these
people the instrumental practice becomes more like a game. For others the
playing, the configuration will be done for the sake of achieving an
interpretable moment or series of moments. The play or configuration will
resolve a time-based performance to a literal object of critical
interpretation.

(That last bit was written really quickly. Sorry.) Anyways, there are many
other dear performers at Loss's festival which I have not mentioned, but
please, you-all, don't take this wrongly. I have only been trying to set out
super-quick the tendencies and themes which I personally believe are
important for us to recognize and engage ....)

.... and I share in this sense of missing you all, since despite this
everwhere we seem to find ourselves in email networks (chiefly), you are not
here when I am ...

"multilayered technological intimacy"



finally existence
collapsing and filling my bordered space
exhibited it's lyrical cinema
of photomontage in a series of overlapping
frames
once the threshold was crossed
i needed immediate release
not from existence itself
nor from my bordered confinement
but from the problematic unsettling
interpretive process invoking cinematic metaphors
both cybernetic and social <diagonal>

i needed to breathe
i needed to visit that central moment
meant to coincide with the time of breathing

but i could not find that time

i was too unsophisticated and was essentially lured
into
music, party, relaxed fun <horizontal>

and now after a series of vertical necessity
the direction of my psyche has changed toward
catastrophic freedom

Dear Maria and all,

As you know, Maria, a group of us from the Poetics List has been
discussing a Poetry Is News-type event in Baltimore for some weeks.
(You were originally on the list but any mail I sent you in the last few
days has been bounced back).  Of that group, only Pierre, Gabe, and
myself can commit to participation, though Arielle may also.  Therefore,
there isn't a Poetry Is News involvemnt at this point.  I see this as an
opportunity for an open forum/open mike addressing the issue of our
capacities and responsibilities as poets in this time of threatened war.

For those of you who wish to participate: The Enoch Pratt Free Library
will provide an excellent room
on Friday February 28, 10-2pm.  The library doesn't allow political
meetings so please keep that in mind
when considering your contribution.

Please backchannel if you wish to participate.

Mairead

"In creation and in ritual, the Hebrew language was considered by Jewish =
mystics as playing a role much more important than the common =
communicative one that language regularly plays. It was the main =
instrument of the creation of the world, and it is the vessel that is =
prepared by man to contain the divine light that is attracted therein in =
order to experience an act of union or communication. In both cases, the =
letters do not serve, in any way, as a channel of transmitting meaning; =
too powerful an instrument, the letters are conceived of as creative =
elements that enable different types of communication, averbal ones, =
that accomplish much more than merely conveying certain trivial =
information. Letters are regarded as stones, as full-fledged entities, =
as components intended to build up an edifice of words to serve as a =
temple for God and a place of encountering him for the mystic....As God =
was able to create a world by means of letters, man is supposed to =
rebuild the Temple in his ritual usage of language. M. Idel, =

This is very sad. Dan was a young man and one of the most knowledgeable
Westerners about language. It is worth seeking out his fascinating
writings on the structure and function of languages, and in particular
native American languages.

F15 3:07pm 53rd and 3d: Crowd has been corralled on all four corners.
Police are pushing the crowd against the buildings.
50th and 3rd: Reports that people marching on the sidewalk were attacked by
police. Completely peaceful when police attacked crowd. Mass
pepper-spraying of crowd and large amounts of police violence. There is a
report that there is a severe lack of medical help at the scene. There were
men, women and children in the crowd.
F15 3:01pm 53rd and 3d Avenue: People on the west side of the barricade
have been trying to negotiate with the police but they may be getting ready
to storm it. There have been seven or eight reported arrests. There have
been reports of plainclothes policemen have been getting violent with
protesters.
F15 3:00pm There have been 2 reported arrests at 2nd avenue and 57th street
of people trying to storm a barricade. The crowd has begun getting very
restless and has begun shouting "War means War."
F15 2:42pm Estimate from organizers on crowd size the rally on 1st avenue
streches 59 blocks north. NYPD usually estimates 7000 people can fill an
avenue block. Including the additonal people trapped by police at 2nd and
3d organizers estimate over half a million people.
F15 2:40pm More reports of police violence at 53d and Third. There were
reports of people climbing atop barricades and being pushed off by police,
about 25 on horses, plus others coming out of buses. The police have
started to push the crowd back from 53rd street. However, people are
completely trapped with nowhere to go
2:18 pm 2:04 At 53d and 3d Avenue, New Yorkers rushed the street barricade
and 15 people made it through. Ten minutes later a group of 8 or 9
anti-capitalists linked arms and organized a second rush on a barricade.
About 50 or 60 other people joined them in the rush. The police brought in
reinforcements, maced 15 or more people, and pushed the crowd back.
1:50 Sources report that police have begun arresting demonstrators on 54th
and 2nd Avenue.
1:43 First avenue is reported to be completely inacccessible-- people who
want to get there to protest cannot. 2nd avenue is full wall to wall in the
60's. We are hearing reports that the police on 3d avenue have given up,
though this isn't confirmed.
1:37 A smaller group of people made it out of the 51st / 3d Avenue pen and
were herded north on 2nd avenue. It is a diverse group. They are now being
stopped by a row of mounted police on 54th st, and they cannot move north.
1:24 We have reports that portions of Second Avenue have been taken over by
marchers as well.
1:23 The uptown Lexington avenue line has been stopped at 23rd street
because of the protest.
1:21 Third Avenue is full from 50th to 53d street . Cars and buses have
been trapped by the crowd-- there are US Postal Service vans, a service
van, and taxis. Marchers have completely taken the street.
1:09 The police are putting up barriers on 53d and 3d avenue. They are
throwing them to one another. There is a huge crowd of people stopped by
the barriers and they are chanting "let them through, let them through."
There have been several unconfirmed arrests of people trying to get over
the barriers. There is a lot of pushing and shoving with the police.
1:07 There is a march occuring on 3d avenue; people are trying to get to
the protest and are moving north. 1:00pm. A report just came in that 2nd
Ave. is "a sea of humanity" protesters have taken over half the avenue and
more people are joining from every direction.
12:41 "3rd avenue and 58th is ours!" says one caller. From 57th to 58th is
completely full. There are no protest pens on third avenue. There are
groups up third avenue as far north as 72nd street.
12:38 The Labor March marching from 59th street is back on the sidewalk.
The police have broken it in half.
12:32 Police are making it very difficult for protesters to get to the
rallly; they are requiring people to go further and further north.
F15 12:06pm Update from Youth Bloc at 24th St and 6th: 300-400 protesters
remained penned in, on the sidewalk not being allowed to move.
Approximately 200 police, 3 deep for an entire block. Possibility that mass
arrests will be made soon
F15 12:02pm If you are heading to the rally from the west side of
Manhattan, you should attempt to get there above 55th st. It will be
difficult to get there otherwise. There are large numbers of protesters
heading north past 51st and Lexington.
F15 12:00pm From the rally: There are large numbers of people turning out
in the bitter cold, and it is difficult to estimate numbers. At least ten
blocks are packed in outside the Dag Hammarskjold plaza.
F15 11:53am Police have confirmed arrests at Union Square. No numbers given
by police.
F15 11:47am Youth Bloc Update: several hundred people penned in by police
at 24th st between 5th and 6th ave. One-hundred police and 15 or more
mounted police. There have been several arrests. Police are letting people
out five at a time. The march is on the sidewalk. The marchers are chanting
"The whole world is watching, they are on our side."
F15 11:39am We have word that the Youth Bloc was the march that moved west
from Union Square, not east. They marched towards 6th ave. and then north.
At 23d st and 6th ave, police moved in and pushed the march back east.
There are several mounted police, 15 vans vans, and several buses. At 24th
st, the march was cut in half by police.
F15 11:25am At the Public Library: Approximately 1,000 people at the
library. There are between 100-200 police in full riot gear, some with
batons drawn, standing in the second lane of 5th Avenue. People are leaving
in small groups, but no organized mach has yet left the library.
F15 11:03am One of the feeder marches just took the street on West 21st
street and 6th avenue. There are at least a thousand people on the street.
About 20 or so riot police are stationed on the street, but they have now
given up trying to force marchers back onto the sidewalk.
F15 10:59am 100 people have now left the Green Party headquarters, and are
headed towards the rally.
F15 10:55am Approx. 1,000 people have left Union Square, and they have just
been joined by an additonal march. The march has headed west on 14th st.,
not east. They are marching behind a banner that says "Our Nation Says No
To War," and are marching on the sidewalk.
F15 10:14am Plans continue to percolate for post-rally marching. Read
updates here.
F15 10:04am Looking for somthing to do before the rally? Come down to the
IMC at 29th street, pick up copies of the Indypendent and awesome party
benefit flyers to distribute at the march.
F15 9:27am Update on crowd control techniques near the UN: 1st avenue is
closed to traffic from 34th to 59th to begin with... Entry to side streets
from 2nd avenue ... will only be allowed every 4th street or so along 2nd
ave, and exit at different streets. [Read More]
F14 12:40am Welcome to the NYC IMC website for the F15 convergence.

i know we all have more important things to do, on the cusp of war
and all, but i thought i'd draw your attention (esp. you academics)
to the current ~mla newsletter~, the president's column, by 2003
president mary louise pratt, entitled "of poets and polyglots"...

i found the piece annoying as hell, not b/c it celebrates the
celebratory mode of poetry (esp. spoken word poetries), but e.g.:

"Today the premier poetry magazine in the United States receives
ninety thousand submissions a year, nearly three hundred a day.  At
the last wedding I attended, two poems composed for the occasion were
performed, one in traditional Urdu by a family elder and the other a
rap in English by a friend of the groom.  Poetry is alive among us,
juices flowing."

this is the president of mla, and no small potatoes as a scholar, for
that matter...

OY...

best,

Does anyone know why CSPAN is not covering the New York rally?  My
impression was they covered the last one in Washington, D.C.  Maybe it's
beyond their geo perimeters as a network.  If they have intentionally shied
away, phone calls are in order. Anybody have a contact ## to share.

Meanwhile, live reportage - in addition to Gabe's footage! - Pacifica
Foundation has got New York Live, and lots of reportage from global dems.
Latest news from inside UN is that Washington/London "leadership" is
"softening" the scripts for their joint Iraq UN resolution.

Well, if you want skitz (all puns intended) turn on Fox TV. I think the
globe is putting to test the credo that if you own the media, you run the
trix (pun intended). I want to believe the P's (most importantly Blair) are
the ones getting running off the street!

On to San Francisco.

hello all,

i'm pleased to report that 160-200 people turned out to read and listen
to poetry against the war this past wednesday night at all souls church
unitarian (16th and harvard streets NW, washington DC). the diversity
and range of poetries and poets and listeners was fantastic. as usual,
the major media outlets here failed to give notice to such an event.
indy media has filled in the void thoroughly, with a front-page write-
up as well as sound files of the complete proceedings.

check out http://dc.indymedia.org and scroll down the page, or else you
can go straight to the story and audio at:

Didn't see you there. We got off at 42nd, went to 53, cut over to first,
went straight over to two feet of the stage barricade. Shot a lot of
footage, including police arrests, etc. - Alan

There was no way of reaching the area of first avenue and 49th street after
about 1:15 P.M. The policde had barricaded all the cross streets. Big crowds
on third and second avenues. In the group, "Kurds and Turks Against the War,"
people were joining and detaching themselves from a circular dance to
anatolian beat. One sign stuck to my mind: "Read Between the Pipelines."

Another group of young men, still on third avenue, playing to tincan and
water cooler drums. Their tempo is irresistable. People all around can not
help moving their bodies. A young woman took off her sweater in the freezing
cold and began to dance, as if in a brazilian concert in the aisles.

Another sign: "Body Bags Are Made of Oil By Products."

I was trotting along and suddenly
there was no applause or dyslexia
and you said it was patriotic
but patriotism hits you on the head
hard so it was really men being afraid
and heartening themselves in their hurry
to control the traffic in the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
LAURA BUSH HAS CANCELLED THE AMERICAN VOICE!
there is no ambivalence in San Francisco
there is no irony in California
I have been to lots of readings
and acted perfectly bored
but I never actually didn't clap
oh Laura poetry loves you make up

Hello to all,

I am so heartened by the turnout for today's protests!  One thing I thought to
say, which I'm sure many of you have already thought of: when you're forwarding
your news, passing along the latest illuminating article or petition, don't shy
away from passing it one to those family members, bygone friends or
acquaintances who you think may be annoyed or angered by the gesture.  You
never know!  Minds can be changed.  I've gotten some expected pissed off
responses from the odd uncle etc but also some very encouraging replies from
people I always thought of as rather conservative politically.  "Keep on
pushin!"

In the meantime, I have two new poems at www.mainstreampoetry.com which, in the
Mainstream spirit and style, take a swipe at George W. and Paul Wolfowitz
respectively: "Fascist Fairytales #8" and "Paul Wolfowitz's Future."  The motto
which motovates these works is Frederick Douglass's:

"At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed...a
fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and
stern rebuke."

For those of you not familiar with the Mainstream Movement and the
compositional methods of its practitioners, feel free to backchannel and I'll
give you my take.

Peace,

Mike.

                                                 Masked Stress

From John Cayley:  "I find it harder and harder to keep track of everything
I don't do."

and Patrick McManus is volunteering a day a week at the local mental health
center
while I find myself quoting Satchel, "The hurrieder I go....
A librarian banishes poets while her husband plays at Teddy rough-riding.
While a poetry thread I started on a self-help health issue internet bb as a
place for my daily penance poetry journal is overwhelmed (the jargon is
intrusive) by a borderline and jocular cowboys posting limricks (sic) with
the careful disclaimer they didn't used to believe in that poetry stuff
because they thought it not Marlboro-man enough, I decide to continue it
even though no remuneration is on the horizontal longitudinally speaking.

My coffee is too cooled and jim Pennebaker has a new pice in ~Psychological
Science~ on pronoun use and suicidal poets and I've learned too well how to
mask the stress and can't get my mind around a shape for this piece and
somehow your offhand comments on a carefully crafted presidential address
bring home to me that the analytical perspective on 'fort da' may be Rankian
rather than Freudian even though his views on the artist have been filtered
out of most college level courses built to the test in our ever-narrowing
intellectual spiral.

And that said, I don't know how to fit in your post which set this off, Joe.
Footnote?  Hyperlink?
Spark? Irrelevant as the U.N.?  How should it be attributed? Per APA or MLA.
This may be all the credit you'll get.  And then who would publish it?

"i know we all have more important things to do, on the cusp of war
and all, but i thought i'd draw your attention (esp. you academics)
to the current ~mla newsletter~, the president's column, by 2003
president mary louise pratt, entitled "of poets and polyglots"...

i found the piece annoying as hell, not b/c it celebrates the
celebratory mode of poetry (esp. spoken word poetries), but e.g.:

"Today the premier poetry magazine in the United States receives
ninety thousand submissions a year, nearly three hundred a day.  At
the last wedding I attended, two poems composed for the occasion were
performed, one in traditional Urdu by a family elder and the other a
rap in English by a friend of the groom.  Poetry is alive among us,
juices flowing."

this is the president of mla, and no small potatoes as a scholar, for
that matter...

OY...

best,

joe"

~Jim Behrle Forgets His Heroes: SPT speech 2/15/03 SF, CA~

Did human nature change on or about September 2001?  That's American
solipsism, Exhibit A.  The 11th has turned from paradigm to myth in just a
year and a half.  We will never know what *really* happened that day, and we
may never know what it really means.

I was talking to John Mulrooney Thursday night, just back from Dakar.  He
reports that the bumpers of cars there generally declare two names: OSAMA &
MADONNA.  The power couple of the new hideous globalization game if I've
ever heard of one.

The lasting impact of that September wasn't the impacts.  The
Administration's response: that will last.  Flag-waving, anthrax, bombing,
invading, propping up new puppets, cutting deals with further devils,
cutting taxes and the whole Iraq watusi--these have served to distract our
fractured and freaked populace while the Bill of Rights was looted and
hostages sit in Guantanamo awaiting a trial or simply to meet with a lawyer.
  Should it make a poet feel *safer* that the Administration holds people
who have not been charges off American soil and sends them to Torture States
so they can give us enough nuggets to turn the warnings up to orange and
send us off to horde bottled water?

We've done nothing but speak about 9/11 since 9/11, and we know far less for
all the chatter.  The breathless declaration of the Boston poet Don Share at
a reading in late 2001, that we'd all be transformed into "war poets" made
me wish immediately that he'd be sent to the front lines, wherever those
are.  Rage Against the Machine famously, furiously sang "There be no shelter
here, the front line is everywhere" in the late 90s.  It was an apt
Nostradamus moment, but I still resist this talk about being at war to
describe our American condition.  Real bombs fall on real people in real
places with real consequences.  No war has been brought to the American
street, just a jittery, paranoid peace.  Those real bombs are ours, those
real casualties aren't and won't be.

Anyone in this room who sees anything but tough times ahead, please raise
your hand.  What time is it, have we invaded Iraq yet?  Plus North Korea's
saber-rattling, but that only effects you folks on the West Coast.  This
while we brace for Al-Queda's counterpunch.  We have resigned ourselves to
living lives in fear, looking up at all aircraft as they pass.

Whatever further doom awaits us down the road has become an understood, a
matter of time, a bright color on some chart.  The American electorate,
unfortunately, as always, deserves what it gets: a half-assed, dangerous
reflection of its own disappointing vanity and depressing stupidity.
Somebody please pass the duct tape.

I wish, especially as a poet, I could live in a static bubble, unaffected by
the horrors of the post-freakout world, unconcerned about the damage our
country is doing to itself and others.

What does this mean for poetry?  Poetry has endured endless eras of human
silliness and has shone through all our dark ages, right?  Not to be
overdramatic, but, to be put simply those attacks, and more importantly the
ongoing aftermath are context for whatever we write now, and a marker for
whatever was written before.

How late is it, and what does that mean for the younger generations of
poets? Business as usual in the poetry world now includes petitions,
protesting, organizing, agonizing.  Also a huge helping of some serious
motherfucking *dread*  This country stands for something unspeakably
different than when I wrote that letter to Larry, c/o the POETRY PROJECT
NEWSLETTER:

Mr. Fagin.

Your recent interview in the POETRY PROJECT NEWSLETTER made me very angry,
and upset many poets I know.  How angry did it make me? I performed a
dramatic reading of your interview at a recent Friday poetry reading,
reciting your interview answers in a voice that was a cross between Burgess
Meredith and Charlton Heston (think: cranky and old).

I posted an angry message on to the Buffalo Poetics Listserv, in which I
accused you and others of a "new-old fogeyism:"

"What we are witnessing, what we are enduring, is a new old-fogeyism: a
fanatical, nostalgic golden look back at our art, at all art.  These voices
tell us, 'Sorry, kids, we had it great and you missed it."

"Bullshit.  These voices tell us 'Poetry doesn't mean what it used to, poets
aren't as smart as they used to be, our magazines were better, our poems
were better, our poets were better.  Our weed, our sex, our boys and our
girls--it was non-stop heaven."

"Bullshit.  These voices tell us 'We had greatness, we had rhythm, we have
our Mt. Rushmore of poets, and now we just need to stop."

"Bullshit.  I don’t think you had to be a white guy and go to Harvard in the
1950s to be a poet in this country."

"Do we need poetry?  Yes.  Do we need poetry from you?  You decide.  Curl up
with your favorite golden oldies by the fire and remember how great it was,
nobody's stopping you.  The rest of us will be writing."

"Mom and Dad, I'm glad you don't like my music.  It's 9:30, why don't you go
to bed now?"

What set me off, why did I feel so angry?  You sounded so smug, you sounded
like a real asshole.  That young poets aren't smart enough to write poems,
that we don't have control of "diction and destiny."  That we're no fun.
That because I have to work for a living and can't get stoned all day, I
can't write poems.  That all young poets write is "lame stand-up comedy."
That everyone should stop writing "for say, five years."

It's possible that you are a smug asshole.  It's possible that you got
caught up in the interview.  Maybe you just don't know what you're talking
about.

I'm happy to report that you are a lousy critic of the current generations
of young American poets, that you have no sense of the great work that is
taking place across this country.  Mr. Fagin, you don't know what's going
on.

There's as much good poetry out there as there's ever been, some truly
wonderful work is being produced.  I'm thrilled to be a reader, an editor, a
poet, at a time when there's much energy, these many voices.

Is every young poet great?  No.  Have young poets figured it all out?  No.
But neither did you, Mr. Fagin, neither did the poets of the 50s and 60s.

Younger poets didn't invent poetry.  This is the American Poetry you have
given us.  If we love Ashbery, Schuyler, Koch and O'Hara, great.  We should
love them, and love a million others.  You are our teachers, you edit the
anthologies, you publish the books, you raise the rent, you show us the way.

We didn't invent sounding derivative, we didn't conjure up "clubbiness", and
we're not the first to write bad poems.  As the wise anti-drug commercial of
my youth said, "We learned by watching you."

This is your wake-up call, Mr. Fagin.  You ought to find out about some of
the great poetry being produced.

You now owe that to young poets.

I'll say it again.  The kids are alright.  Why don't you give them a fucking
chance?

--Jim Behrle

I may find out how Roger Daltrey feels, playing the same tune for the rest
of his life.

Larry's home phone number is (212) 254 6621.

I never intended to become a spokesperson for my generation, whatever my
generation *is*.  Larry's interview bothered me because I think it
represents the feelings of many older poets.  The latest POETRY PROJECT
NEWSLETTER sends us thoughts along the same line from Ron Silliman and Lyn
Hejinian.

Ron wrote in his weblog: "There has been a depoliticization of younger
people generally and that has impacted poets.  You see the long term result
in a lot of writing these days that is simultaneously politically correct
and depoliticized, a politics really of cynicism and disgust.  So this also
becomes an incentive not to organize, not to write critically."

Lyn is quoted from a RAIN TAXI interview from 2000: "I think poets in their
mid-20s and mid-30s now do not have a comparable historical moment [to the
Vietnam War].

The responses featured in the issue are worth a read, particularly Renee
Gladman's, Chris Stroffolinos', Laura Elrick's and Alan Gilbert's.  But John
Yau's, to me, stands out: "Hejinian doesn't recognize that all moments are
historical."  He correctly points out the emergence of the AIDS virus as a
defining/altering moment for younger generations.  I would say these current
dangerous moments, and my generation's ongoing reaction to them will
ultimately define us.

Why do some older poets dis us?  How should we combat this narrowmindedness,
should we waste our youth in this endeavor?  Now is the time for the
self-beatification of some established poets to end.  Your war is not our
war.  Your answers may not be our answers.  There are no saints in American
Poetry.  What have you done for us lately and why is that *better* than what
we've done?

I think youngsters have been too admiring, too eager to please our teachers,
our publishers, our blurbers.  We define ourselves through their impressions
of us.  We, like them, are an ambitious and competitive bunch.  But it feels
as though Poetry, Inc. is top-heavy, loaded with immovable established
management and lacking in upward mobility.  Welcome to the Working Week.

Should Creative Writing Programs exist?  Innovative and mainstream poetries
are defined in the universities, pitting poet against poet for jobs, books,
laurels, scraps.  Students can be secondary to some teachers: more important
to them is status and the status quo.  Sure, the hours are great.  But isn't
it all a big scam, a pyramid scheme to replace real dialogue, real
innovation, real communities?  Why are CVs more important than poems just
now?  I think Larry's indulgent statements stem from his endless role as a
workshop leader.  To him American Poetry means 25 blocks of Manhattan 40
years ago.

You define yourself as an irrelevant blowhard by living solely in the past.
In the millisecond a poet of any age is no longer open to new work, you
should grow a large asterisk on your forehead and become a walking footnote.
  Lyn and Ron are open to new work of the younger generations, and write
smartly about that work.  Which is why they both should fucking *know*
better.  They wouldn't have put up with garbage like this and why should we
now?

I find it amazing that Larry can mouth off to an interviewer on one hand,
but also, somehow, publish great first books by David Perry and Jacqueline
Waters.

Bitterness is the enemy of innovative poetry.  No one was promised anything
when they were drafted into out art, no one is entitled or deserving of
anything more than to work hard and write as best we can.  It's silly to
begrudge and bemoan the success of others, which doesn't preclude our own
successes.  What academia gives us is far outweighed by what it takes away.
The professionalization of poetry is laughable, there is no smaller American
payday.  The university presents poets with a tangible corporate ladder, a
way to measure ourselves against one another.  But when poets start their
young lives in the art in a $40K debt-hole, what else is to be done then but
somehow also teach?

Teaching is *not*, and should not be the only profession poets can thrive
in.  We need more bookstores, magazines, publishers.  There should be a
Small Press Traffic, Poetry Project or Innovative Poetry Shack in every
major U.S. city.  We need lawyers, doctors, pretty much everything else.  We
may have teaching covered.

If you're going to teach, you ought to be a great teacher.  Students place
themselves in debt, in awe and in bed with you to glean something profound
from the exchange. We've listened to you, what don't you listen to us?  We
continue to march in your silly poetic wars as if it was 1980.  It's not
1980.  It's closer to *1984*--that sad terrible mixture of technology and
fear.

Magazines cannot sustain themselves on flash and ego.  The table of contents
of innovative magazines should never be more impressive than the contents.
And why are editors of magazines sometimes a 24 point bold declaration?
Sure, take the credit for the editor's hard work, but not for all of the
work between the covers or behind the links.

Laziness, complacency, self-importance, celebrity: these are the enemies of
poetry.  Can anyone here name one poet who became a better poet after
becoming enormously famous?  No, not ever.  Why do some of dream of being
the next John Ashbery?  Universally-heralded across all aesthetics, reading
to hundreds?  They have to invent new awards for him.  It's a dangerous,
silly dream, which leads, to borrow from Jedi Master Yoda, "to suffering."
But also garbage office politics bullshit that talented poets should be
above.

I think now is an exciting time to be a young poet and to be experimenting.
Many older poets missed the chance to let punk, rap and noise seep into
their work.  I'm thrilled to be influenced by Sonic Youth, Public Enemy,
ABBA, Beck and The Pixies.  I feel I'm surrounded by amazing contemporaries.
  Maybe that's why I feel like I have to answer Larry and his pals.

Innovative Poetry has become too comfortable and too commercial on this
watch.  The mimeo revolution has been replaced by weblogs, which might
someday become a compelling way to critique.  Right now they seem saturated
with jism and self-splatter.  Maybe we need to become
post-review/post-blurb/post-author-photo poets.  The important thing is to
remain open to the new, and to tell it on the mountain when it does come.
We've listened to older generations, maybe it's time for them to listen to
us.

American Poetry is moving toward more hyper moments.  Computers can play
better chess than we do.  They will some day write better poems, paint
better canvases and write better novels.  English will not forever be the
dominant language on our continent.  Very soon we will have to overthrow the
U.S. government.  Nothing's sacred and no one lives forever except Dick
Clark.

Robert Creeley writes, "Poets are a company and poetry must finally be a
tribal art, despite the fierceness of the contest."  I'd say poetry is a
Casanostra.  The vast majority of older poets are supportive mentors and
heroes, and we should jump into bed with them at our earliest opportunity.
They need to get louder than the Fagins.  We've come to live in an
unbearably anxious, unstable and indecisive regime where, literally,
anything's possible.  If we turned on the TV tomorrow and the Moon had
fallen onto the Washington Monument, that would be par for the course.

It's better to snuggle beneath the covers with the poets we admire and who
admire us, across all ages.  Sleep with Larry Fagin if you want to.  But if
you're looking to get tuned in, to find out what's really going on, please
don't.  Please sleep with me instead.

Remember, you Fagins! Younger poets have you outnumbered at least 25 to 1.
Come out with your hands up, we've got you surrounded.

about 50 femmes d'une certaine age and a handful of guys and 3 dogs
stood in front of the falmouth post office for an hour, 11-12, lined
up side by side, with signs saying "Stop US bombing and terror,"
"Drop Bush not Bombs," "Imagine Peaceful Solutions," and so on.  A
lone counter-demonstrator stood a bit away, with 2 signs saying
"Freedom is worth fighting for" and "support our troops".  It was
bright sunshine though cold.  We were, as women of a certain age and
class are wont to do, wearing brightly colored woolen hats and
scarves of all hues, and the signs were mostly a neon lime green, so
we were quite colorful and hard to miss.  Lots of people honked as
they drove by and we waved and gave little thumbs-up signs if we were
wearing mittens and v-for-victory signs if we were wearing gloves.
Two scientists right next to me were discussing shrimp-eyes and
particle physics. A woman 2 people down was all proud because Howard
Zinn had autographed her sign some months ago at a demonstration in
boston.  Falmouth is a traditionally quaker town since the 1600s and
still has a strong quaker community, so a lot of little old quaker
bubbies were there, and the good old WILPF gang.  It was funny when
folks were afraid to meet our eyes as they walked past us into the PO
--we were such a fundamentally non-threatening looking group.  The
people driving by in SUVs smoking cigarettes tended to look angry at
us, while the people in more modest looking cars seemed more
encouraging. It was all very charming and small-towny.  To get home
and read gabe's post was quite distressing, as many of my friends
from here had gone down to nyc for the demo there.  i mean, it would
have been distressing anyway.  is it the police chief or the mayor
who has ordered such reprehensible tactics?

Just to add to the list of favorite signs at yesterday's demonstration in New York, where a lively band of us, many from this list, joined together, under a Poets Against the War banner, at the 59th Street Bridge and walked the few blocks to the rally (it was cold!):

*Axis of Unilateralism*
*Make Poetry Not War*
*Duct and Cover*

The last one I think I'll use as a title to a poem. Perhaps a variation on the first two might be:

*Make Love Not Unilateralism*

If I had gone to the trouble to make a sign, it might have said:

*We march to defend the honor of France*

But maybe that's why I didn't make a sign. And besides, we weren't allowed to march.

Duck tape did come in handy for those of us who have started to keep a roll on our persons  at all times: wrapping the feet with duck tape kept them a bit warmer and made us feel we were contributing to the anti-war effort.

By the way, I notice that my two attempts to post to the Poets against the War site have failed, so I will paste in below the one I sent last week.

We also had a genuine nazi in full uniform, swastikas and all, with a sign

We were in that ruckus at the intersection at 54th and 2nd Avenue. We left
our house at 11:00 to meet the Poets for Peace at 59th and First. I work at
66th and York and walk by 59th and 1st nearly everyday. The first sign of
things to come occurred when we learned that N train service from Queens
into Manhattan had been conveniently cancelled due to "construction" on the
tracks. It's not unusual to find Manhattan-bound service suspended on
weekends, but it hasn't been the case in months. We transferred to the 7 to
Grand Central and exited out the back of the platform that leads out to
42nd and Third. I told Laura it was the closest spot to the UN, but I
regretted missing the Poets for Peace. We walked north on Third Avenue
because we were prevented from walking east on 42nd. Every couple of blocks
we kept being told that entry to the rally was moving more and more north.
At first if was 49th St., then 51st St, then 53rd, then 55th, then 60th,
and finally 61st, which fed us into a "holding pen" between 59th and 60th
Streets on 1st Avenue.  The sound system was not working. The big screens
weren't either, and this forced us to get out even though a police officer
told us, "First you want to get it. Now, you want to get out? Well, you
can't, and I'm not going to tell you how you can leave."

We walked to the back end of the holding pen and went west on 60th Street.
We met up with a beautiful crowd at 2nd Ave and 60th, right where the tram
comes into its station at the mouth of the 59th Street bridge. The crowd
had heard that by that point in the day (~1 p.m.) 1st Avenue "holding pens"
were filled all the way up to 71st Street. Second Avenue had been closed up
by the many rally participants, and we were all enjoying ourselves. There
were more radios on Second Avenue, and we were all listening and cheering
to Al Sharpton's speech. But, then a woman fell to the asphalt. We tried to
help her and called over the police. By the time the cops lackadaisically
got to her, some people had helped her get to her feet. When one cop asked
another if the woman was okay, he replied, "Yeah, just another liberal."

The crowd began to dissipate and a critical mass began heading south on 2nd
Ave. I estimate that it was anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 people, but I
honestly have no idea. At approximately 58th Street, we all began marching
south down ON the avenue. We all started to get giddy. It was the first
time we'd actually had some fun all day. We'd been herded like cows all
morning. As we continued south, chanting, talking to our fellow marchers,
cops on horses quickly road up toward the crowd. They split up and lined
the sides of the avenue allowing the throng to pass them, and then filled
in behind us. They began to follow and head toward us. We looked ahead to
see police on horseback lining the intersection at 53rd Street; they'd
closed off the Avenue.  Behind the horses were police cars and paddy
wagons.  Unknowingly, we'd entered a gauntlet. We were trapped at the 54th
Street intersection. Drums were playing. People were singing. Banners were
passed among the crowd. And then the police behind us forced their horses
into the middle of the crowd. The crowd closed in behind them. Picture 12
horseback police in the center of a crowd of maybe 2,000 people. The crowd
started chanting, SHAME ON YOU. SHAME ON YOU. SHAME ON YOU. The traffic had
been stopped on Second Avenue, which for those who do not know is a major
southerly artery on Manhattan. Close to ~1 hour passed as the police waited
for all their back up to arrive. All of a sudden, the police who had
managed to alternately turn their horses around in the middle of the crowd
began forcing people toward the sides of the avenue by trampling us with
their horses. Cars waiting on Second Avenue. They wedged open the crowd
with a vise of horses. As the wedge began to be successful people fought
back, but we did not have the might to counter them. As the wedge opened up
even more, police vans with stacks of barricades drove into the opening,
and out popped riot troops who pulled the barricades off the vans and
placed them down behind the horses. They had successfully opened up 2nd
Avenue for the traffic. Someone said they were spraying, but I did not see
any spraying. We saw 15 paddy wagons approach, and we decided that we'd had
enough.

For me, it was a sad day. I watched our rights snatched away from us. I
heard antiquated rhetoric on the side of the marchers and heard old hippies
brag about how back in the day they knew how to chant and that now the
youth had no idea how to protest.

My experience was totally different - old hippies and young hippies, etc.,
everyone was making a lot of sense; there was good feeling in the crowd.
The police on 1st were helpful; there were five of us, and they let us
through and/or climb over the barricades through the corridors. I'm not
sure why. The footage I shot ended up a 20 minute video doc that looks
good.

Second Ave. definitely was different, had an angry air about it. We just
waited by one of the barricades towards the east and eventually we, and a
few hundred others, were let through. Once we were on 1st we were
surprised at how easy it was to move around.

Having all the avenues filled did send a different and maybe more
important message - the city was _occupied_ - not just an arena - and it
seemed almost like an uprising to me.

I don't know what you mean by 'antiquated rhetoric' - I'm not sure what
you expect. Charles B. posted some interesting poet slogans today - but
they seem as dated and not dated as anything else. A march or demo doesn't
gain or lose strength by the rhetoric - god, that hasn't changed since the
Fr. revolution if not earlier - but by an intensity, a media presence,
maybe a spirit recharging us to continue our work, I don't know. It's one
thing to complain and organize and analyze online; it's another to _see
people,_ the effects of all of this, and it was wonderful and even
spiritual in a sense -

Lynda and I took an 8th Ave. bus uptown (prob. about
1:00 or a bit later) and got off around 53rd St. and began
walking east through the theater district (crowds of tourists
lined up to get into, e.g., Flower-Drum Song). East of
B'way. we started seeing people moving westward, away
from the demonstration area. At Lexington Ave. we found
that police had barricaded 53rd St. and were not allowing
anyone without a local address and ID through. Lynda
thinks the barricades had just been moved into place.
So we turned south on Lexington, where people with signs
etc. were streaming mostly northwards. I think the police
were telling them they could turn east somewhere up in
the 60s. At Lex. and E. 50th we found we could go east
to 3rd Ave. There were masses of people at that
intersection and quite of few police--ordering people
to stay on the sidewalks, ordering people with cameras
down from their perches on something or other across
the street from us. Two or three columns of riot police
with clusters of plastic handcuffs at their belts and truncheons
in their hands moved into place. That was about it for us. The
street, at 50th and Lex. was barricaded as we started west.
And a couple "Corrections" buses were ensconced on the
block. We wandered south and west again, passing just a
block below Times Square, where we saw lots of placards
and heard chanting.

So, we saw lots of anti-war folks, no pro-war folks at all
as far as I could tell, and lot of police on the move, but no
horses, no head-cracking. I've no idea how many people
I saw. The main demonstration was way over on 1st Ave.,
and we didn't get nearer than two long crosstown blocks
from there. Close, but no Seeger.

tom, corey, maria, others---

i tried to give some indication of what i found annoying *in* my
post---foremost, pratt's preciosity (that wedding stuff---i felt like
i was listening to someone who'd just discovered poetry AND hip-hop
AND urdu, and that someone is now president of the mla)... but also,
the cavalier presumption e.g. that one can offer w/o controversy what
the "premier poetry mag in the US" might be (is pratt referring to
~poetry~?)...

but it's pratt's apparent surprise at the presumed "resurgence of
poetry," thanks e.g. to ~def poetry jam~, that points up the
problem... here's another choice bit from that piece:

"We see the effects in our classrooms.  Twelve years ago I instructed
students in a graduate seminar to memorize a poem and perform it in
class the next week.  The assignment failed.  No one had any idea how
to do this; no one had seen poetry performed.  Around the same time,
looking for poetry accessible to a freshman culture class, I fell
back on Whitman's ~Song of Myself~.  Another failure.  They couldn't
understand it, students said.  The had no experience reading poetry,
couldn't hear it in their heads.  By the late 1990s that had changed.
The hip-hop generation comes into the classroom with ears adeptly
attuned to synergies of sound, image, meaning, and rhythm.  They know
how to hear while reading and to comprehend while hearing.  They
memorize long poems so that they can recite them later, and recite
them they do.  They compose and perform at one another's birthdays
and graduations.  These days in my freshman course on Latin American
Nobel laureates, Mistral, Neruda, and Paz trump Garcia Marquez.  The
favorite classroom exercise is comparing multiple translations of a
poem and producing our own version.  Other undergraduate teachers
report similar successes exploring language through poetry

class, among other things plays a role here.  just as the Beats and rock and roll opened poetry to a wider audience, so has hip-hop to a whole new generation.  and OF COURSE those who are tuning their ears to hip-hop are going to acquire skills in listening closer to words, and will therefore be more likely to read and listen to a broader spectrum of poetry is they so choose.  now, whether you like hip-hop or not, frankly, is irrelevant.  what we're talking about here are some hard facts about kids getting familiar with poetry (whether you think it is or not) and how it can change the way they hear the world.

i do bring up class because class needs to be brought up, again and again if need be.  no one in my family --to my knowledge-- ever read poetry, too busy working, raising kids, etc., before my mother, who, like a lot of working class kids of her generation, plugged into Ginsberg.  i admit, she didn't take it much further, unless of course i'm counted as an extension of her initial interests in poems.

these sorts of things MUST be encouraged!  we MUST try as hard as possible to expose EVERYONE to these things!  why?  because it's POETRY and other arts that open the mind to new ideas which build the mind's skills and abilities to put a changed set of ideas BACK out into the world.  it's creativity and encouraging everyone's participation in creativity which will bring the ultimate changes of improvement to all our lives.

so this, in the face of war, is very important.  poetry is essential, whether we're at war or not.  and i LOVE hearing that the largest poetry magazine (whatever it is) receives 300 submissions a day!  think about how much more aware the world will be when they start to receive 1,000,000 a day!

Meanwhile in Toronto humbler numbers anywhere btwn 10,000 - 70,000
depending on what you read, I have no idae how they count these things.

Really good feeling, peaceful and energetic at the same time, lots of
people pushing strollers, one guy playing bagpipes in full kilt etc,.
amazing given the biting cold --

Montreal and Vancouver much bigger. Apparently the march in Edmonton was
in the 10,000s, really nice to hear for a city of 800,000 in a highly
conservative province.

Joe,

I agree. I've been to some readings of the kind he's
referring to, and they come off more like pep rallies
and rap contests. It seems that Mtv is taking over a
medium that continued in other venues and never died
out completely. There are kids in school who
understand poetry, but just like sports, it's not for
everyone. Turning it into something it's not, like
rap, or hipster homecoming (e.g. the chick with the
best piercing and most gratuitous use of the word
"fuck" wins) fails the task. Namely, to draw
connections between poetry and the modern art of rap,
but not to confuse one for the other. In a larger
sense, poetry is swept up as an incidental activity in
the bohemian trend that's so popular now.

wow!  okay, so the slam or hip-hop scene isn't for everyone.  why can't we have a larger world view?  i'm clear that i'm naive to believe that POETS could have a larger world view.  but these ARE class issues, the more i read this thread.

where i grew up, rock and roll was --believe it or not-- just about the only thing around to snag your ear and interest in words.  and if you were so inclined, than it was going to lead you elsewhere, if you were interested in being led.  so if i know this to be true in my white, working class small country town, than why can't i see this to be the case elsewhere, with other underprivileged groups?

chill out you guys.  encourage others!  so what if they're not reading the things you're reading!  you have no idea what someone else's idea of poetry may mean to them, or how it enriches and focuses their lives.  poetry is much too BIG to be contained, don't bother trying.

i guess i have to eat up my 2nd and last post today, and hastily, on
this question of economic class that conrad raises, as i'm as
sensitive to same as anyone:  yes, rap and hip-hop open poetry up to
class, *if* we're imagining this exposure to economic class (and
ethnicity, depending on who's listening) that you get via spoken word
and rap and hip-hop forms that are presumed to issue out of a poor
urban? context... all of which, as i'm suggesting via my last labored
sentence, is something of a generalization (and i'm the first in my
non-poetry reading family with a college degree, like you conrad?)...

but a few things:  first, as has generally been observed, more white
suburban kids buy rap and hip-hop than any other target audience...
so in this sense, the class effect *can* be more complicated than it
appears---what some of us used to call, perhaps unwisely, "slumming";
while for performers themselves, spoken word and rap and hip-hop can
provide, sure, an outlet, a literate outlet into the public domain
(as in ~8 mile~)... further, at the campus that currently employs me,
42-51% of the student body hail from households with annual incomes >
$200,000/year... with a few exceptions, it's difficult for me to see,
then, just how rap and hip-hop is opening up the economic class
issues in my classes from any BUT the perspective of "higher class
pays attention to/consumes presumed lower class-ethnicity" (as it's a
predominantly white campus, too, albeit spoken-word events on our
campus do serve, thankfully, as a nexus for students of color)...

in all, i'd need to hear more about the class effects you're discussing...

finally, and more to the point i was making, i do have reservations,
as flora intuits, as to the value of poetry and poetry events that
take their lead from ostensibly performative venues and forms, but
i'm willing to set my reservations aside for the sake of any
perceived "opening"... still, pratt's prattle (if this is not too
gendered a way of putting things), while celebrating some obvious
realities, seems oblivious to the economic reality that coincides
with same (paul krugman situates this have/have not reality squarely
in the nineties), and seems oblivious as well to acres of poetry and
performance that prefigure slams... she wants us to believe any
number of positive outcomes that hardly jibe with my sense of what's
happening, in all, in poetry---and not just on "my campus"---and she
wants us to believe these changes are all owing to the sanguine
effects of a cultural outside (to academe), one that she could do
nothing about herself as instructor until her students were exposed
to such cultural currents... as if she had herself no agency in this
process, and as if such changes were, well, anthropological---"they
know how to hear while reading and to comprehend while
hearing"?---reading and hearing WHAT, may i ask?... whitman?...
enthusiasm is vital, yes, but---

this all seems too obvious---just have a close look at that para i
reproduced... quite honestly, i can't detect in my hip-hop bound
students any greater comprehension skills than a decade ago, if i do
detect a somewhat greater desire to move toward performance...
perhaps we need to zero-in on specific aspiring groups, so
defined?... but that's another discussion, for tomorrow perhaps...

best,

joe

i've got to agree with you craig...
hip hop does encourage the kind of hearing needed to
appreciate poems, and the best hip hop I would say
rivals much of what we're used to as poetry...and
while i share with flora the trepidation about the
best piercing and most gratuitous use of "fuck" (only
because i went to far too many readings when i was
younger where this DID seem to be how poetic quality
was measured), i also rejoice in the fact that poetry
is STILL not dead, no matter how far along the chain
we move....

bliss

I agree.  It's clear she has no familiarity with contemporary poetry, yet she feels professionally entitled to offer an opinion about it.

I interpret her talk about the need to "create bilingual professionals" as both a pat on her own back (she is a Spanish specialist after all) and also a nod toward the fact that new PhDs in Spanish have an easier time finding jobs than their English-language colleagues do.  Possibly she represents the wing of the corporation that is still turning a profit.

But isn't the point of such a column--whatever its ostensible subject--really just to show how well-intentioned the MLA President is and, by extension, how well-intentioned the Profession is?  Oil-and-gas-industry newsletters do the same thing.

It's always sort of amusing, I think, when academics of a certain age credit popular interest in poetry to the "hip-hop generation."  You know that their grasp of "hip-hop" is based solely on cable TV and the fashions their students sport.  By linking a form of contemporary music to the interests of "the younger generation," they excuse their own lack of curiosity and paper over any real value such music might have.

I recommend the film "24 Hour Party People" as possible antidote to academic condescension and dullness.

Joe,
    Correct me if I'm wrong here, but i did pick up some irony in your
reaction to the mla president's speech.  At least enough irony to delay for
a brief time your departure to protest as a poet and a man.

   I do admit to feeling some irony (plus other feelings) on reading the
words of a white (?) female elected president of an organization I'm sure
many have called irrelevant and which i take it has a history of not
encouraging the teaching of writing when the funds for this would be 'more
appropriately committed' to academics....[once again trapped by grammar, I
see]...[she] called for essentially recognition(?) of language as she is
spoke rather than poetry as it has been taught in the academies and this is
a side issue but it's likely she heard this language as she is spoke on TV
rather than in the street [trapped again. so move on to] POETRY and the UN
as traditional irrelevancies but that may figure in a domestic disagreement
(or maybe not - this is something i will never be privy to) between a white
female librarian and a white male and suddenly POETRY and the UN are
relevant to us all, each and every one,'for lack of what is found there',
even if written by a white male modernist.


the language I was given no longer works!

of course this was inevitable...


So now there's a "poets for the war" website (www.poetsforthewar.org), run
by this guy: Charles L. Weatherford

funny that he also runs a website which offers custom poems for both

My experience at the demo was encouraging, for the record (in response
to some comments about the general feeling of the event). With regards
to the creativity of the marchers, I was not around for Vietnam so I
can't compare, but I was around for Gulf War I, and I was a bit saddened
to hear some of the same slogans we used 12 years ago, not because I
found the rhetoric antiquated but simply because of the repetitiveness
of history. Were 60's hippies more spirited/inventive/organized? I'd
have to say that, really, I don't care, but I find the attitude of young
demonstrators today amazing in that it is so cynical/jaded and so
energetic/optimistic at the same time. Lots of great puppets, funny
posters, sometimes absurd slogans — there's a very worldly
self-consciousness about it which I think is healthy for the
participants and the movement. Also, some people just don't like
chanting (me included), for good reason having to do with the importance
of individual thought. As for the police, my recurring impression was
that they were surprisingly friendly and good-natured, especially if you
compare their behaviour to that of the tear-gassing, clubbing riot
squads of the Summit of the Americas rally in Quebec in 2001, or
Seattle. I'm not saying that a little police oppression is okay, I just
find that accounts of demonstrations that focus on nothing but the
skirmishes between police and crowds are strangely myopic and
counter-productive. Rights may have been curtailed, but being asked to
walk on the sidewalk seems like a minor offense compared to, say, being
asked to sanction the bombing of innocents. All in all, I thought the
demo was an impressive success.

I'd been hoping we'd get more at the march than Melbourne's 150,000 - M. is

tend to get bigger numbers than Sydney despite the smaller population - but
lazy sensual Sydney got off its bum on a warm Sunday afternoon, turning out
between 250,000 and 500,000 - John Pilger was graphic, incisive, saying all
the things one doesn't hear in the media and my son was variously moved to

don't think Howard etc realise quite what they've helped spawn - all those

we can turn this around.

This is an updating of what were arguably Emma Goldman's most famous

Just back from the march and rally here in SF, which was still going on
when I left (4pm) -- carrying the sign and an arm in a sling since
9:30am was sending my back into spasms, so I had to call it a day.

So first off, thanks to friends and comrades in NYC, Toronto, London,
Rome, et al, for their inspiring turnout yesterday. And to NYC
especially for its determined resistance to state repression. (Tho' I'm
sure this could be said of many other places, that's just the one I have
the eyewitness accounts of). I'd like to think SF would have been a day
late but not a dollar short even without yesterday's show of solidarity
to galvanize us, but -- well, thanks. Estimates as I left were ranging
from 150,000 (police) to 250,000 (march organizers). Pick your own
number, it was huge, and took Dan Farrell and myself nearly three and a
half hours to walk from the Embarcadero to City Hall.

Mostly companionly, pleasant feel here today, but _more_ of
everything -- people seemed angrier, more joyful, more given to despair,
more utopian, et al, all at once. Didn't witness any trouble with
police, though like I said, it was big, so I don't pretend to know what
happened everywhere along the march route. Organizations and individuals
too many to name. What seemed of particular note to me this time,
though, was at least the rhetorical beginnings of a convergence between
the SWP-spinoff leftists who organized, and the liberal-left who
marched. Significant (as far as soundbites can be) multiple sightings of
slogan: "It's the _political_ economy, stupid!" Oh, and lest I forget,
two more to add to the list of favorite signs: "Coalition of the
Unwilling." And one carried by an elderly English woman: "Will the
member from North Texas please SIT DOWN?" Me, I came in my
plastic-sheet-and-duct-tape flag, stripes written over with a glossary
of U.S. foreign policy language. More of a stop-and-ponder object than a
recognize-and-cheer one.

Happiest moment: march stalls out as the labor feeder march attempts to
merge. While we wait the fifteen minutes or so to get our signals
straight, the ILWU drill team keeps spirits up with a step routine.
Great black and gold uniforms with white caps, definitely the sharpest
looking contingent on the march: comradeship, confidence, and discipline
shorn of its possible militarism. Many other unions making the merge
along with them: SEIU, Teamsters, CNA, CWA, etc. As we're getting our
act together, I recognize a face under one of the giant puppets back in
the Women in Black contingent -- someone who read at the event Wednesday
evening. Go say hi, get separated from Dan just as things start moving,
find him again, ok...

Best coincidence: Dan is wearing a hat shaped like the head of Big Bird
from Sesame Street, to the front of which he's attached a pin from the
protests against the first Gulf War. Several blocks into the march, a
woman comes running off the curb to hand Dan a photocopied sheet with an
image of Big Bird and the legend: "This war brought to you by the letter
Dubya." Sheet remains with us for the rest of the march, past the family
with several small children chanting, "Iraqi children one and all, U.S.
children hear your call," past the dancing Hare Krishnas, past the
Jewish Voice for Peace marchers, past the strong Filipino contingent,
the Puerto Rican group linking Navy bombing in Vieques to other aspects
of military imperialism, the guy in the pink spandex unitard riding the
unicycle, the group in business suits smeared with blood who yell,
"Everything is fine. If there was a problem, you would have heard by
now. Put down your signs and go home. Everything is fine," the
Jordanian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Brazilian, Mexican, Cuban drummers,
musicians and dancers. Run into Andrew Joron and Jeff Clark, then
promptly lose them again -- hard to keep track of more than one person
at a time, and Dan's hat is easier to follow. Run into woman who let me
share her cab to January's march when the bus never came, then lose her
again.

Best moment of political clarity: After reaching Civic Center Plaza and
being permanently separated from Dan in the crowd, I stand and listen
while an incredibly sexy older British socialist marshals all the
resources of his velvety voice to explain primitive accumulation to a
crowd of mostly "mainstream" SF liberals. They look convinced. If only
we all had such immediate instinctive appeal... He finishes with a rap
about peace itself not being enough, imperialist peace being predicated
on imperialist war. OK, maybe "predicated" is mine -- so sue my
imaginary for being mostly grammar.

we lutes,   enceinte

Much more to be said, so I hope others will chime in. My one good arm

I second Taylor's report! As different from the January 18 walk (I have a
tough time saying "march" as in military anymore) this one, though larger b=
y
a 100,00  (250-300,00), felt more somber - a troubled sense of what a
cliff-hanger this potential war has come to be, like no matter what our
force, a frustrating sense of Bush & Co. all but turning the final opening
knob on Hell's door. Yet, great costumes, signs, a marching (!) band, drums=
,
dancers.  It's all so counter-corporate. Such a diversity of faces and ages
that don't like any in the Calvin Klein's soft-porn models in the
cylindrical kiosks that line Market Street (People delight at putting No Wa=
r
in Iraq stickers and peace signs across their bare torsos.) The home grown,
mostly hand created anti-war signage flies in the face of Corportate logos,
advertising, all the other forms of audio and visual branding that saturate
daily life.  For me, this is one of the great delights of these walks: the
public revelation of identities that are so various and outspoken in ways
that are normally withheld from view by conventional media, advertising, as
well as the strictures of daily work life.  Urban Whitmanesque.

I did keep notes on the signs that held my eye - here goes:

    Vive La France
Give Peace a Chance

West Coast Terror Level =3D
      Green

Bombing  for Peace is like
F=B9ing for Virginity

There is No Willing Coalition

Terror Lies in the Bushes

Bomb a Parent
Create a Terrorist

Noam Chomsky Is My Homeboy

Queer Pride
Not Genocide

Our Intact, Breast Fed,
Home Birthed Children
Will Not Fight Your War
       for Oil

Revolution Begins In The Sink:
Only When Men Take Full Responsibility
For Their Share of the Cooking,
the Cleaning and Washing Up
Only Then Can Join With Women
And Together Build a New World

Waiter for Peace:
This Kitchen Will Not
Make New World Orders

Duct Tape Cannot Protect Us
from Our President

Wake Up &=20
Smell the Fascism

Fossil Fools

Another Angry White Guy
   For Peace

Homeland Security Is
     An Oxymoron

Somewhere in Texas=20
A Village Is Missing an Idiot:
And a Village in England
  Has Found Him

Bastards Without Borders

Who would Buddha Bomb?

Primates for Peace

With PreEmption
There=B9s No Redemption

We Are The Coalition
of the Unwilling

Peace or Total Eclipse

All these reports (Marilyn Hacker, on another list, also reported in
from Paris; she marched with a group of Americans opposed to war, one of
whom carried a sign that said, in French, "I swear to you, I didn't vote
for that asshole!) make me really determined, at the next event --
because there will without doubt be a next event -- to read Ginsberg's
1991 "Hum Bomb" in some way. As others have mentioned, it's weirdly, and
sadly, predictive.

I would add to these reports that in spite of a heavy storm last night, the
sun shone on and off and there was no rain.  It was about 58 to 60 degrees

Was packing a camera and part of a group handing out leaflets featuring a
defaced Guernica and text written by persons deeply involved in art.  The
title is, "Neither Their War Nor Their Peace."  One says to persons in the
crowd, as distributor:  Political thought, not war, or, Reading material?
Marketing, something one doesn't know how to do, but it comes naturally with
the deepest feeling. Most accepted, some rejected.  This is what a homeless
person might feel like if she asks for money and gets none.  The covering of
art isn't insult enough.  A good lesson.  We might have passed out 5000
broadsides among 15 of us.  There were probably 300,000 taking geisha steps
up Market Street,, colorful and also ordinary citizens.  There were kids
wrapped around light poles like vines, there was a pregnant woman with
writing and pictures on her naked very big belly, there were down's syndrome
people marching, there were the blind, the deaf and the dumb, the
wheelchaired and the steel crutched.  Persons who had been in wars and said
so on their signs.  A person one sees at many such events, and  A REPUBLICAN
FOR PEACE, there was AN ORDINARY MODERATE FOR PEACE, there were more Asians
than Blacks, many elderly and many young, and many in between.  Girls and
boys dancing, drums drumming, and some boys with primitve (almost earily
post-apocaplytic saxophones made out of straws and pcb pipes--beautiful
sounds, like way out jazz.  When I said, hey you guys sound a little like
Rova Saxophone Quartet.  They said, Oh We Love Them.  What an honor you think
of us with them!  They were about less than 20 years old.  I said, Larry
Ochs.  They said, yeah!
     Some police smiled.  As if given a flower in 1968, genuine, and this was
that. Several of my party and I stayed until the tail end of the march which
was followed by the clean up crew--marches are messy--police escorts, city
garbagemen and their machines with brushes and sprays.  There was a scarcity
of trash receptables, as they are believed by the superstitious to be
potential bomb sites.
       San Francisco has a leftist city council, headed by a man named Max
Gonzalez who goes to poetry readings and supports the Poetics Program at New
College and elsewhere.

Here were some original signs spotted to add to Steve's:

WE CAN'T LET THE WORLD BE RUN BY THE LOWER CHAKRAS:
      bush, dick & colin


911 IS A CALL FOR HELP NOT WAR (carried by a child)

HOW DID OUR OIL GET UNDER THEIR SANDS?

BLAME FLORIDA.

And a very old man of about 90 on the BART with a sign:  FUCK BUSH.

At 12th Street in Oakland, on the way out of Berkeley--towards the tunnel
under the water to the first stop in San Francisco, The Embarcadero, where a
rally was to be held, near a grassy knoll--one of my California  College of
Arts & Crafts students got on and threw her arms around me.  The metal from
her bountiful piercings and neckware just about pierced me.  But it was
great.  Again, people were packed so close, you could have gotten pregnant.

adjust one itself

the moment i tuck my clothes in, there are disturbances across its
surface, don't one continually adjust itself?

or like when an itch, someone else's scratching getting rid of it. or a
tickle, one can't do that to oneself.

body holds itself together as plastic sphere, they know when a disturbance
arise, when Other appears, disappears. some say it all depends. i say it
is very controversial.

body is very complex. you put a hat on and it fits not so right, you know
how that feeling is bad for you. it's not even the site for you, it's just
my bad feeling.

body always huddles and collapses into this sphere, you don't want
anything bothering it, i bend my head and feet into it when it is very
snowy, you are warming it.

what a thing i take for granted, i mean i don't think about you when it
happens, then it happens that i tuck it in, all of it, and then you are
very fine and it is a nice day. or you can go and do what you want.

just to add a bit to what Maria writes. saturday my wife and I stood in
front of the old post office in Bedford, MA, some few miles north and west
of Maria, among 10 or so participants in the demonstration. what we
experienced chimes with Maria's account. I am not Mr Civic Pride (he lives
down the street), nor have I made myself particularly noticeable in the town
except perhaps in having run 1000s of miles along the local streets, yet I
was conscious that my standing there put the face of _someone within the
terms of the demonstration. not in a heroic sense, but a local one. I think
that this is what Maria is getting at. the many large demonstrations put the
muscle of numbers behind the anti war movement, but the very local squeak of
these little demonstrations have their impact as well. the jarring sadness
that I felt was both scary and uplifting. resistance is fertile.

Recently I've been fighting my aversion towards mass gatherings and have
attended a number of different public events in my area - SF Gay Pride
Parade; Bikers' gathering in Hollister; today's. I do this more as an
anthropological exercise than anything else, I must confess, and am
beginning to see that there are certain aspects in which all such events can
be found to relate. Costumes, signs, chanting, marching, good cheer. This
one had not as much deliciously wicked nudity as Gay Pride nor as much
chrome and beard and belly and tattoo as the Bikers gathering, but it gave
forth a distinctly special vibe nonetheless.

I walk from the Embarcadero to CC in 3 1/2 hours, taking about 50 pictures
along the way. None that I would call a perfect moment (although I haven't
reviewed them yet), but a few that should be fairly okay. I focus on
close-ups, as I know the crowd angle will be well covered by others. I also
record 2 1/2 hours of sound on a portable DAT, since I feel that audio tends
to get neglected at these events, with so many cameras and vtrs capturing
the splendorous colors and visual dynamic. (Also, because my videocamera
broke down yesterday - damn!) The panoply of sounds is like a Charles Ives
symphony of protest and celebration, with drumming and chanting and waves of
spontaneous cheers rippling through the crowd. Many more energized young
people make a showing than I might have assumed, and a lot of parents have
come with children holding signs. The police are largely an invisible
presence except at the entry point from BART, where they meet everybody with
crossed arms and indomitable stares. There is also a helicopter hovering
ominously above the crowd towards the end, but it is far enough away not to
cause any real concern, except to make the implicit coercive point: You are
being watched!

Many smiles and hugs in thought from passers-by. A cable car appears to have
been hired for the event and rings its bell regularly as it drives up
Broadway. People climbing spontaneously onto statues, public toilets and
newspaper stalls to get a wider view. There is a mixture of the disturbing
and the absurd as garish color photos of Iraqi victims of the Gulf War
intermingle with crude hand-drawn signs of Bush as vampire, as emperor, as
ape etc. A wafting of many lovely foreign accents and languages, including
Arabic. One woman is simply waving a large American flag and fits in
perfectly. Voices on loudspeakers bounce off the stone walls of the old
library. An inebriated homeless man exploits the moment with a sign that
attempts to link his "cause" with that of the crowd. A few seconds of Jello
Biafra (I think) on mic telling people to "go home, shopping is good!" A man
in tidy business suit and made-up bloody face. Large, black shrouded
puppets. The sweet smell of weed now and again. And, happily, many widely
ranging colors of flesh, and not a single ugly incident. All in all, a
moving experience.


My predictions:

Okay, let's say for the sake of argument that it's not about oil. Then it is
about power and money and greed. Hasn't it always been? Does anybody doubt
that what we are seeing in Iraq is Iran circa 1950 all over again? I await
the arrival of Iraq's bloody new Shah, along with the revolution from within
that will eventually overthrow him and cause Arabs to have reason to hate us
all over again. And why is the comparatively moderate Powell supporting this
madness? Simple. If the war works according to plan he sees himself as a
shoe-in for VP in 2 years, and president for the next 6. You heard it here.


A couple of slogans I make up myself, but do not put to use:

Depilatate Bush!

Kocaine Kowboy Kommando

The Ape of Wrath

I know even as I say these things there are people who
will disagree. The larger issue for me is the
marginalization of traditional forms which (I feel)
require a different kind of discipline and are
therefore a different art form. I am not saying rap is
not valid, but I don't think it's the same thing. So,
when people think "oh, this is poetry," I think it
leaves out a lot of what is going on now for the sake
of something more performed and more user-friendly. I
also cannot bring myself to think of slams as poetry.
My experiences of them have been image-based and they
don't seem to focus as much on the content of the work
as the flashiness of presentation. Again, an art form,
but not what I think of when I think of poetry. I know
art forms evolve, and how can I be a fuddy-duddy at
26? Who knows?

by your reasoning then I guess visual poetry is also not poetry?

People! It's an opinion, not gospel! Poetry is
subjective by its very nature. I cannot help what I
like.

Cold day for a march, around 7 degrees, but we got 500 people assembled at
the Federal Building, then marched a loop through the downtown, and back to
the Fed. MaJo wore a string of Tibetan prayer flags as a shawl, I had a
navy watchcap with a roll of duct tape sewed to the top like a tiara. Every
parade needs a Dadaist. I decided against words, for the same reason I'm
not writing anti-war poems. All my poems are anti-war. Best sign I saw was
worn by a girl of about 7 years, NO FIGHTING. That about sums it up. Peace
and compassion for all sentient beings in limitless space. Sylvester

well that's fine, but you actually said "Turning [poetry] into
something it's not, like rap, ... Namely, to draw connections between
poetry and the modern art of rap, but not to confuse one for the
other..." --there was no qualifying acknowledgement of relativism, or
that one might be a subgenre of the other, or that you happen not to
like rap...which, of course, doesn't make it "not poetry."

FYI



Artistic Sign Language:
Symbols of the Coming Bush Fall
By Bernard Weiner

The Crisis Papers

Sign is symbol, symbol is sign. Consider:

*Powell goes to the United Nations so that the missile attacks on
Baghdad and Basra can begin -- and, in the lobby of that grand building,
Picasso's "Guernica" painting, which depicts the horrific results of the
Nazi bombing of that Spanish town, is covered over prior to Powell's
arrival. No use embarrassing the U.S. by reminding folks of what's in
store for Iraqi civilians.

*Ashcroft, in his police-state zeal, begins shredding the Constitution's
Bill of Rights with its guarantees of due-process of law, and, early on,
has the huge lobby statue of the Goddess of Justice draped and covered
over because of its exposed breast. How appropriate to shroud Justice so
that she can't see what's being done in her name.

*First Lady Laura Bush cancels a poetry workshop at the White House
because she suspects that a number of America's high-profile poets, in
the sacred grounds of that seat of power, will raise the issue of the
coming war with Iraq.

Did you notice the thread that unites these events? In all three cases,
symbolic shrouds are placed over art, so that nobody will notice the bad
things that are being done in American citizens' names.

But art knows. Art sees beyond, often before the general public is aware
of what's going on. (Often before the artists themselves are conscious
of what they're revealing.) Art points us in new directions that make us
think and question.

To those inclined more to rigid-order mentality, art is a virus that
needs to be stamped out, or, at the least, tightly controlled. ("When I
hear the word culture," said Nazi leader Goebbels, "I reach for my
revolver.")

It's all part of the so-called "cultural civil war." Those who control
the signs and symbols control the polity. Thus, minions are trotted out
to denounce artists and their tendency to look for complexity, ironies,
hypocrisies, hidden humor. To incipient fascists, the world is a
Manichean one, divided into black and white, those who are Good and
those who are Evil ("You're either for us or against us").

And since they are certain that God obviously favors their side, it
follows that those in opposition -- or even (or especially) those who
point the way to other visions of complex reality -- are part of the
enemy forces and must be dealt with.

One problem with authoritarianism -- whatever brand comes along:
Stalin's communism, or Hitler's fascism, or Islamic Talibanism, or
whatever we're moving into in America right now -- is that it makes art
more delicious and tempting. The public is not dumb and eventually comes
to figure out that the "truth" being propounded by the frightened rulers
does not match the world most citizens actually live in. And so they
begin to seek out and support art and artists and, most of all,
comedians -- those sly artisans, those holy fools, that can shake the
foundations of power with a well-aimed dart.

Musicians, playwrights, poets, painters, sculptors, dancers, novelists,
filmmakers, online satirists, comics -- everything these artists do in
an authoritarian society comes to be seen by the public in the light of
the repression visited from above.

A story to illustrate this point: American avant-garde theater artist
George Coates was invited to bring his visual extravaganzas to Poland
during the dark times there. One of the huge slide projections used by
Coates was of a manhole cover, which image covered the entire staging
area. Various human forms emerged from the holes -- i.e., real actors
came out of holes in the stage, but, given the projection, they appeared
to be emerging from the holes in the manhole cover.

The audience took this in with rapt silence and then a few brave souls
began clapping. Then waves and waves of applause and cheering washed
over the actors. Coates was mystified by the audience reaction.
Audiences in the U.S. loved this bit of theatrical magic, to be sure,
but nothing like this Polish crowd.

After the show, various Polish theater artists came backstage to talk to
Coates and his cast. They nudged Coates in the ribs and whispered their
admiration for his willingness to confront the Polish Communist rulers
by celebrating the "underground." Yes, what was merely an interesting
use of a visual image for Coates was a cunning reference to the
underground resistance of a budding Solidarity movement. After a few
attempts at explaining himself, Coates simply smiled and nodded as the
Poles heaped praise on his revolutionary "political" art.

Art has power. Art unmasks. Art tells lies in the service of truth.
(Whereas governments lie in order to conceal truth.)

The more lies authoritarian governments tell their citizens, the more a
sub rosa consciousness bubbles up from the culture's artists and then
from its ordinary citizens. It's a slow-growing and, at times, dangerous
movement -- which is why the forces of reaction try so hard to stomp on
it -- but it is an amazingly strong and vital and resilient force.

Because totalitarian governments rest on fake foundations, when those
regimes fall, they fall with amazing quickness and ferocity. One day
there's a wall, the next day it's torn down and the celebrations begin.
One day there is officially sanctioned art, the next day those huge
statues are toppled. One day, the culture arbiters and censors are in
control, the next day they are in disgrace -- or in jail.

Americans, still gripped by fear from 9/11, have tended to be in a state
of animated numbness, putting up little resistance to the machinations
of the authoritarian rulers. Similarly, out of great sympathy for the
post-9/11United States, various nations around the world bowed to the
wishes of the Bush government.

Bush&Co., meeting little resistance, interpreted this relative lack of
opposition as full support for their programs, foreign and domestic. And
so they've continued to want more, tighten the screws more, reach and
then over-reach for more. Their motto and guiding principle seems to be:
"We can't be stopped, so let's just go take it all."

Suddenly, though, Bush&Co. are running into overt opposition. Their
allies abroad are telling them -- to their face -- that current American
policies are mad, wrong, dangerous. More and more conservative allies at
home are warning the Bush Administration that their dash toward imperial
rule abroad and draconian Constitution-shredding at home is a violation
of what America stands for, and will bring the United States (and, given
the economic interweavings between nations, much of the world as well)
nothing but disaster.

The current U.S. rulers will not alter their course. It's war with Iraq,
full speed ahead and to hell with the rest of you -- especially ignorant
"old Europe," and American dissidents at home. It's a proposed extension
of the so-called USA Patriot Act, to give the federal government even
more martial-law-like police powers in controlling the society -- the
"cover" is hunting for terrorists, of course -- and to hell with the
protections guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.

These Bush&Co. leaders are so arrogant, so rude, so greedy and
power-hungry, so taken with themselves as God's mesengers and as the
world's only Superpower, so convinced they are right in the
tunnel-vision black-and-white world they inhabit, that it's clear their
days are numbered. It may take a bit longer to build to critical mass --
and there is going to be death and destruction and persecution while
that momentum is being built up -- but when the time for their fall
arrives, it's going to be quick and nasty. And we'll finally all wake up
from this nightmare that has crushed our economy, diminished our moral
light in the world, disgraced our beloved Constitution and country.

And at the vanguard of this movement away from the shadow America and
back into the light will be our our poets, our comedians, our painters,
our playwrights, our novelists, and so on -- "dangerous" artists all,
even when they're not political. They simply see too much, too clearly.

A toast to their hungry vision.

Nick,

I don't feel strongly one way or another about blogs, and I don't begrudge
anyone success.  Up with the people.   I simply agreed with Jim's observation
that "right now they seem saturated with jism and self-splatter."  That's a
plain enough observation without getting too personal.

Self-splattered,
Aaron

this is brilliant.  i'm keeping a copy of it to keep myself humble.  i =
might not always agree with every single word of jim's, but his overall =
point is so important---as is his energy, as are his smarts.  i'm not a =
young poet, but even at my age---i guess since i'm not "famous"---i've =
frequently been subjected to old-fogeyism, and have learned to be =
grateful for whatever keeps me rebellious and myself.  some years ago a =
friend gave my first book to HIS friend, a "famous" poet advanced in =
years.  this famous old (male)(white) poet (who's still writing the =
exact same kind of poem he wrote when he was 30) wrote directly to me =
(who asked him to?) and said that during his internship with roethke =
he'd learned all the things that were "wrong" with my writing, that i =
should be "chagrined" to publish "a book like that," and that allen tate =
would have told me "you could do better."  pretty funny stuff.  i keep a =
copy of that one too. =20

keep ranting, jim.  it's great for us to hear from you.

WHERE WE ARE

      for Kerry Sherin

        We may not have chosen to live inside Dick Cheney’s mind, but we
do.
        Wyoming, I read somewhere, is the safest place to live in North
America.
        No tornados, no tsunamis, no earthquakes, no hurricanes,
monsoons, cyclones, or floods. No major airport: no big planes crashing
in the sleet. Not even much traffic: not too many car crashes.
        But if living Wyoming is so safe, living inside Dick Chaney’s
mind, though it was formed in Wyoming and stood for Wyoming in the
Senate, is not safe at all.
        How do you get from Wyoming to Shock and Awe?
        Getting from Love to Hate, that’s easy: Love, Live, Give, Gave,
Gate, Hate.
        Love comes before life, and since newborns don’t survive on
their own, life at the beginning involves giving. It can’t not: breast
milk, protection, language, diapers made out of whatever, some sort of
attention before you crawl or walk. Everyone living got some of that
somehow.
        That gets us up to Give. Gave comes next because giving is
tiring. You give and give and what thanks do you get? Nothing. Or worse.
They think they’re entitled; they’re madder than ever: they sulk in
their rooms, they’re sarcastic, they throw rocks.
        So much for giving. I gave at the office and, since they think
they’re entitled and are madder than ever, the next logical step is to
build a gate, which will keep things quiet at least.
        But as we know, gates creak at night, they leak, they break, in
fact, gates concentrate whatever’s on either side, they distill hate.
        Love, Live, Give, Gave, Gate, Hate: Q.E.D.

        But getting from Love to Hate only sheds a little light on
getting from Wyoming to Shock and Awe.
        Shock and Awe? “Shock and Awe” is the Pentagon’s current battle
plan for Iraq: 300 to 400 cruise missiles the 1st day (more than in all
of Desert Storm), 300 to 400 the next, to demolish water, electricity,
communications, government buildings, roads, bridges, infrastructure in
general; 6000 satellite guidance kits to convert so-called “dumb bombs”
into so-called “smart bombs,” etc. “The sheer size of this has never
been seen before,” a Pentagon official told CBS. “There will not be a
safe place in Baghdad.” Harlan Ullman drew a direct parallel to
Hiroshima: the Iraqi people will be “physically, emotionally and
psychologically exhausted”; it will be “rather like the nuclear weapons
at Hiroshima, not taking days or weeks but minutes.” A 1996 report
elaborates: the point is “to impose [an] overwhelming level of Shock and
Awe. . . . [to] seize control of the environment and paralyze or so
overload an adversary’s perceptions and understanding of events that the
enemy would be incapable of resistance.”
        This is Shock and Awe, remember, not Wyoming.
        But by the end it gets a little hard to tell them apart:
overwhelming levels seizing control of the environment, paralyzing
perceptions and understanding of events.
        That works for Wyoming and just about anywhere in the United
States.
        That’s the problem with living inside Dick Cheney’s mind,
whether we’ve chosen to or not.

        What’s the point of Shock and Awe?
        To free the Iraqi people.
        Problem:
        “No safe place in Baghdad” contradicts “To free the Iraqi
people.”
        Rationale:
        Since the Iraqi people are enslaved inside Saddam Hussein’s mind
that mind must be destroyed. That means destroying Saddam Hussein’s body
wherever it is in Baghdad, which means brushing aside Baghdad to find
him to free the Iraqi people trapped inside his mind.
        But dead people are only free in the most limited way. Not much
bang for the buck there, really.
        Deeper rationale:
        Forget “free,” “love,” “give”: it’s an adult world. Shock and
Awe is adult political theater for a world audience. To reach an
audience that big you have to project. That’s the point of Shock, the
sheer size of which has never, etc. Otherwise the audience won’t be
struck with Awe.
        What’s the point of Awe?
        Awe kills two birds with one stone. For good Arabs, it
inaugurates democracy, somehow. For no-good Arabs, Awe will . . . what?
Awe will awe them into submission. Then things will be quiet outside the
gate.
        I can hear Dick Chaney arguing that Awe worked at Hiroshima.
        But the Japanese people were at war with us, and Awe didn’t work
outside Japan. The Iraqi people are not only not at war with us, we’re
rescuing them from Saddam Hussein’s mind. And as for working outside
Baghdad? Destroying it will awe Al-Qaeda? That’s a stretch. There are
more Al-Qaedans in London or Berlin than in Baghdad. Maybe we should get
Berlin first.
        No matter how big you make Shock, you can’t get to Awe.
        Even with a placid audience like the U.S. electorate, you can’t
get there.

        Forget it, we’ll never know the exact route from Wyoming to
Shock and Awe.
        Some combination of Gate, Hate, Oil, Worship of Force and
Getting Reelected mixed together in Dick Cheney’s mind got us halfway
there; and Shock and Awe is already halfway here: Here, Baghdad and
Here, Wyoming. We’re half “physically, emotionally and psychologically
exhausted”; our “perceptions and understanding of events” are half
“overloaded.”
        But even half a mind is enough to do the math: we’re half
capable of resistance.
        The shocks are huge, disgusting, realer than any hell, but at
least they’re not shocking, once we give up our imaginary safety.
        The other half, Awe with its ersatz religious capital letter, we
can resist right now, completely.
        The bombs are awful, all the worse because of the
thoughtlessness that aims them, but they don’t deserve a shred of awe
from us.
        Not a huge victory, but it does mean one weapon is destroyed,
the one they always use first.

[The Shock and Awe language comes from various web sites found on Google
under “Shock and Awe”: The McLaughlin Group; World Socialist Web Site,
etc]

Subject:      Swift on War and Pride
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Apropos of Maureen Dowd's op-ed in yesterday's NYTimes, in which she bets
her lot that war at present seems certain because of the Bush
administration's testosteronic need to save face. What started out as
avarice for oil has turned into carrying through as a matter of pride:

fr "A Full and True Account of the BATTEL Fought Last FRIDAY, Between the
Antient and Modern BOOKS in St. JAMES'S LIBRARY," aka "The Battle of the
Books":

WHOEVER examines, with due circumspection, into the annual records
of time, will find it remarked that War is the child of Pride, and
Pride the daughter of Riches:- the former of which assertions may
be soon granted, but one cannot so easily subscribe to the latter;
for Pride is nearly related to Beggary and Want, either by father
or mother, and sometimes by both:  and, to speak naturally, it very
seldom happens among men to fall out when all have enough;
invasions usually travelling from north to south, that is to say,
from poverty to plenty.  The most ancient and natural grounds of
quarrels are lust and avarice; which, though we may allow to be
brethren, or collateral branches of pride, are certainly the issues
of want.  For, to speak in the phrase of writers upon politics, we
may observe in the republic of dogs, which in its original seems to
be an institution of the many, that the whole state is ever in the
profoundest peace after a full meal; and that civil broils arise
among them when it happens for one great bone to be seized on by
some leading dog, who either divides it among the few, and then it
falls to an oligarchy, or keeps it to himself, and then it runs up
to a tyranny.  The same reasoning also holds place among them in
those dissensions we behold upon a turgescency in any of their
females.  For the right of possession lying in common (it being
impossible to establish a property in so delicate a case),
jealousies and suspicions do so abound, that the whole commonwealth
of that street is reduced to a manifest state of war, of every
citizen against every citizen, till some one of more courage,
conduct, or fortune than the rest seizes and enjoys the prize:
upon which naturally arises plenty of heart-burning, and envy, and
snarling against the happy dog.  Again, if we look upon any of
these republics engaged in a foreign war, either of invasion or
defence, we shall find the same reasoning will serve as to the
grounds and occasions of each; and that poverty or want, in some
degree or other (whether real or in opinion, which makes no
alteration in the case), has a great share, as well as pride, on
the part of the aggressor.

I like your account, Gloria. Probably either one of us should have said
something more bout the large to size "Guernica" carried high above the
Walk. Held up on poles by four or five women,  (produced by Robin Henderson
and the Berkeley Art Center), the canvas' figures kept catching angles of
sunlight between the buildings. Talk about "Shock & Awe" - definitely my
kind - albeit tragic - a powerful, cold and compelling reminder of plans for
the "Tomahawk" missiles aimed at the people of Baghdad. And refreshing to
see Picasso back at work outside the context of high art, Museums, etc.


I keep trying to figure out the pathological rational for an attack on
Bagdad. Say 250,000 people are killed, and/or wounded and/or psychologically
traumatized for life etc. Are Rumsfeld-Cheney-Rice-Wolflitz & Bush imagining
that the "new Iraq" will celebrate these deaths and casualities as national
sacrifices for the "rebirth" of democracy in Iraq?

For a refreshing look at the new power of public opinion with which this
Administration - if it is not totally pathological (nuts) - has to contend,
there is a good article in the NY Times:
 http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/international/middleeast/17ASSE.html

The President of the Board of Supervisors in SF is Matt Gonzalez (not Max),
a Green. My hope and suspicion is that Matt's political voltage went way up
yesterday. I bet on a run for Mayor and more. He, too, is refreshing.

Materia poetica, poesis of the will to struggle...

I take heart and joy from this demo sign in Melbourne downunder this
weekend, deftly posited against the Bush 2 war- machine regime and its
sleepwalking rhetoric of re-nuclearization and global
terror/fundamentalism in (blind all-seeing) killer reverse:

"Asses of Evil-- Bush Blair Howard"

yes, Meaghan Morris et al, we share that conjunctive malaise; but there is
also the splendid counter-geographical Fanonian plea on a magic-marker
demo sign in SF street protests Sunday for a (new)  new world order that
really would be a change and relief for many:

"USA-- OUT OF NORTH AMERICA"

"The Santa Cruz Sentinel" today, under a photo of the same swarming SF
demos, ran a helpful article for those sore-afflicted with Bush 2 regime,

"Doctors Prescribe Protests for War-related Anxiety"

(www.santacruzsentinel.com).  The Sentinel, counter to the citizenry of
Santa Cruz, is normally a right-wing newspaper, but even they must be fed
up with this preemptive-strike war upon the globe in the name of the
desert storm 2.

The Sentinel did not quote Edward Said today on the massive demos as a
global eruption to take hope in, but I will, even as the US we write
our anti-war poetry inside pushes for new brands of war, insecurity
states, rogue hostility,  and everyday terror.  Said writes,

"But it is also a great and noble fact that for the first time since World
War Two there are mass protests against the war taking place before rather
than during the war itself. This is unprecedented and should become the
central political fact of the new, globalised era into which our world has
been thrust by the US and its super-power status. What this demonstrates
is that despite the awesome power wielded by autocrats and tyrants like
Saddam and his American antagonists, despite the complicity of a mass
media that has (willingly or unwillingly) hastened the rush to war,
despite the indifference and ignorance of a great many people, mass action
and mass protest on the basis of human community and human sustainability
are still formidable tools of human resistance. Call them weapons of the
weak, if you wish. But that they have at least tampered with the plans of
the Washington chicken hawks and their corporate backers, as well as the
millions of religious monotheistic extremists (Christian, Jewish, Muslim)
who believe in wars of religion, is a great beacon of hope for our time.
Wherever I go to lecture or speak out against these injustices I haven't
found anyone in support of the war."

And Senator Byrd from the coalmines of West Virginia has become our
Jeremiah railing agaist the Bush 2 terror-regime in a kowtowed and
silences house and senate that want to sign on the dotted line and go back
to sleelwalking market-time...

Yes, Kissinger now warns that if the US does not push on into Iraq
its credibility as a superpower will be lost forever, and we all know
what a peace-lover he is.

***********************************

introduction:
The human character contains both a light and a dark side, good and bad,
individually manifested. Deeply rooted is a dark-sided
element:  Violence.
In happy surroundings, it becomes hardly visible and in
less happy surroundings - either of a physical, psychological,
environmental, ideological, economic or political nature  -
nearly automatically a kind of survival
strategy with all the known consequences we see
manifested in conflicts on a small or large scale.
Violence is present anywhere, hidden or sleeping,
hesitating, waiting or in action, starting from simple
mobbing via verbalor physical attacks, the bandwidth has no end.

Nowadays, globalization, social injustice,
unemployment, increasing wealth on one side and
on the opposite increasing poverty (without mentioning some
causes) produce a climate where violence has a fertile
soil.  From the attack on 9/11 in the USA, people from
the Western civilization became painfully aware that
security of any kind is a mere illusion; not only the
internal, but also the external enemy is present anywhere.

Artists are said to be the consciousness of a nation or society
as they reflect the actual state of the psychological and physical
environment.
When this state is penetrated by violence, nobody is surprised that
violence becomes a universal subject for artistic reflection, the differenc=
e
may
only be the view on it and its perception depending on
the respective cultural background.

'Art and violence both seem to stem from the abstract: that place beyond
logic, the realm of the emotion. When they intersect we are simultaneously
repelled and attracted, frightened and excited. Historically this meeting
has been wrought with complexity, and as cultural violence in every society
increases, we are prevented by paranoia, censorship and ethical demands fro=
m
asking, and sometimes even posing, some of the most important questions
violence and art together and separately produce: how is violence
represented, and what or how much of it do we need to resist the cultivatio=
n
of fear and the encouragement of dependency? Is violence a tool, a process
or a result? When are artistic portrayals of violence justifiable? As
intellectual exercise, ritual, or spiritual enhancement? For other purposes=
?
Or are they never justifiable? Is violence in art an action, reaction, or
reflection? '  (quotation: festival statement).

How different the results of an artistic reflection can be is
shown through the Violence Online Festival, a New Media
online exhibition project curated and organized
as an individual event by Agricola de Cologne
including more than 150 artists from
30 countries presenting their work. It forms a
dynamic collaborative art work presenting very
individual visions and use of media.

The relevance of violence becomes visible also through
the high quality standard of  all the included works. Each
of them represents another aspect of violence - caught
in textual poetry, running as a video or embedded in an
interactive environment of a net-based art work.

In reaction to the key role (mass) media plays by displaying and even
promoting
violence, a new environment (interface) has been created for Violence
Online Festival, which houses and hosts the art works within a virtual medi=
a
company named "Violence Media Incorporated".
By dividing the company into different departments (eg.
"Violence for Happiness" , "Violence Marketing" or "Violence Broadcasting")=
,
it becomes clear that their meaning
has a rather ironic or sarcastic character, which gives
the embedded art works a new meaning.

While surfing through this environment, the visitor is forced to ask and
give answers,  and becomes slowly a part of this network of art through his
reflections and changes of perception.

This reminds me of the letter (reprinted in Granary book's collected
heliczer) from Robert Graves to piero heliczer:

Thank you for the poems. In absence of a guiding metre ( not strict, but a
norm on which to make your personal variations), I wish for a music which
would fix them permanently on the mind; as it is, they read to me like
translations of poems from a foreign language which I would like to
understand. Forgive me.

Robert Graves
Canellun, Mallorca.
March 7,1958.

In my mind, "like translations of poems from a foreign language which I
would like to understand," is a huge complement. Not to mention the fact
that poets like Allen Tate and Robert Graves hold pretty much no currency
nowadays.

I just finished reading Diane Wald's (hello Diane!) The Yellow Hotel and
thought it was a wonderful book precisely because it was so subtly and
completely its own thing: quiet, personable, unpretentious and uniquely able
to infuse the domestic landscape with real emotion, rather than the
solipsistic dribble of a lot of poetry that tries and, in my mind, mostly
fails.

Jim, I enjoyed reading this and appreciate the consistency with which you're
always unafraid to articulate a position. It might seem like a small thing,
but I think doing that (articulating a position that is) is something a lot
of us are guarded against: it opens one up for attack (ugh! more war
metaphors again).

As a young poet (27) I've come to realize that I'm not writing in order to
seek favor/acceptance/validation from those already established, rather that
I'm writing within a community of MY peers, my friends etc. (which is what I
feel the whole language thing was about, creating a context for one's work,
creating a community as opposed to waiting for that community to accept one)
That's what I think is so great about what Jim's doing with his reading
series and canwehaveourballback etc. (I live two hours from Boston, where
Jim does his great reading series, but I try to make it out as often as I
can.) The poetry that is most important to me is being written by my
friends! Here's to moving out of the shadows and making our own!!!

The aerial bombardment campaign Bush plans is called "Shock and Awe."  But
I think the lunatics in DC are now the ones who feel "shock and awe" -- how
surprised they must be to witness the huge movement rising around the world
to oppose the New Roman Empire.  I marched in SF, and I was inspired by the
creativity and passion of so many ordinary people, and I'm excited to read
about the all the actions reported on this list.  All during the weekend I
heard right-wing pundits on TV acknowledge that world opinion is against
the war and that world opinion is a force to be reckoned with.  The NY
Times quips that there are now two superpowers, the US and world opinion,
comparing the world revulsion to Bush's war brain to the 1989 Eastern
European uprisings and even to the revolutions of 1848.  So, this is a
taste of a different type of "globalization," one we used to call
"international solidarity," except this time people around the world are in
solidarity with each other, since we are all potential victims of Mad
Cowboy Disease.  Now all sorts of small and large ways can make this "world
opinion" into a material force, and even if the lunatics go ahead with
their war, we have hope.

There was also a protest in Tallahassee, FL.  It was
not very large, and the most effective banner might
have been "Who would Jesus bomb?"!  We did not walk
either, rather we stood on each side of Monroe Street,
which leads to the Capitol.  The police did not even
show up.  This was particularly interesting for me, as
my only other experience of  demonstrations is a
French one.  As one event leads to another, Billy
Collins happens to read in Tallahassee, today, and
earlier on, when asked the hot question about the
involvement of poets into politics, he said that
"poets against war is like generals for war," which
was very funny, at first!  I'm not sure it is very
accurate though, as I have noticed among the
mainstream poets a certain disdain toward any attempt
to be even slightly "political."  This said, Billy
Collins eventually reminded the audience of his recent
declaration against a war at this point and went on
with his presentation.

The following story was posted on www.nationalphilistine.com.

February 15, 2003

(NEW YORK CITY) =96 Artist Emilie Clark and writer Lytle Shaw were arrested=
=20
for posting pictures of people from Baghdad in Soho late Thursday night.=20
Both have been released. A court date has been set to prosecute the two for=
=20
showing New York City the people who will die in a possible war against=
 Iraq.

Clark and Shaw were members of the Baghdad Snapshot Action Crew. Based in=20
New York City, the crew of 75 artists and activists began posting simple=20
flyers with pictures of ordinary Iraqi citizens around New York City, in=20
anticipation and solidarity of the February 15th anti-war rally.

The pictures were taken by artist Paul Chan, who recently returned from=20
Baghdad as a member of the Iraq Peace Team, a project of the Chicago based,=
=20
Nobel Peace Prize nominated activist group, Voices in the Wilderness.

Clark and Shaw were taping the letter sized flyer on a lamppost at the=20
corner of Mercer and Prince Streets when three undercover policemen=20
arrested them. They were charged with criminal misdemeanors. Shaw was=20
released after five and a half hours. Clark spent seven hours in jail=20
before her release. Clark is pregnant with her first son, and is expecting=
=20
this Spring.

The arrests were a clear attempt by the police to intimidate New Yorkers to=
=20
stay away from the protest. =93If there wasn't a march on Saturday we=20
wouldn't have been arrested.,=94 Shaw said. While in custody, police=
 harassed=20
Clark and Shaw with talk about how dangerous the rally will be. =93They kept=
=20
saying how mace was going to be used on all the protesters,=94 Clark said.=
=20
=93And then they said they had heard suicide bombers might attack the=
 rally.=94

What was most disturbing to Shaw was how the cops tried to justify their=20
actions against the two. "They tried to appeal to us sentimentally," Shaw=20
said, "as though the repression they were enacting was really in our best=20
interest."

"They wanted to send a message that we should stay home because it [the=20
protest] was dangerous, and they didn't want to see us hurt."

The court date is set for March 13.

Small Press Traffic presents
Etel Adnan & Brenda Iijima
February 21, 2003 at 7:30 PM

It was a rare pleasure to have Etel Adnan read at SPT last year on
International Women's Day, at the release party for our anthology Technologies
of Measure: A Celebration of Bay Area Women Writers. We are so pleased to have
her back for a full reading now. Adnan was born in Beirut in 1925 and is the
author of numerous books, including Paris When It's Naked, Of Cities and
Women, and Sitt Marie Rose, which has been translated into over ten languages
and is considered a classic of Middle Eastern Literature. Adnan currently
divides her time between Lebanon, Paris, and the Bay Area. Like Adnan, Brenda
Iijima is a visual artist as well as a writer. She hails from New York City
where she creates gorgeous handmade books. She is the author of several
chapbooks of poetry including, In a Glass Box (Pressed Wafer, 2002) and
Person(a) (Portable Press, 1998). "I see /you staunchly." For a preview of
Iijima's work, both textual and visual, check out theeastvillage.com.


All events are $5-10, sliding scale -- free to SPT members, youth under 18, &
the CCAC community -- and begin at 7:30, unless otherwise noted.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of Arts and Crafts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin) (please see our website for directions & map.)

I just finished reading (even though not completely digested yet) a
fascinating new article by Jim Pennebaker (who was involved in some recent
research on suicide and writers) that I think has implications for recent
discussion of psychology, spirituality, and writing and....("The secret ife
of Pronouns: Flexibility in Writing Style and Physical health, Campbell and
pennebaker, _{sychological Science, 14:1, january, 2003, 60 -64.).

Briefly, they use Latent Semantic Analysis to study the 'junk' words in
writing samples rather than the content words.  Oh no!  Langpo and
materiality and style and science all in one article.

Their specific conclusion here, that variation in pronoun usage (point of
view possibly) in writing is healthy than being stuck in a rut will
hopefully be subject to further research in the next few years, but the
methodology might be worth looking at even though it's that nasty hard
science stuff we don't like to dirty our hands with[****, trapped by grammar

Would like to see an analysis of the pronouns of the poets against the war

And this from Doug Manson . . .


[New Technologies for your Cantos ]


In Enjambistan at the end of 2001, the fusion of precision syllables and
information dominance produced a new poetic concept in which small numbers
of Special Operator metaphors on the ground used laser pointers and
Aesthetic Positioning System receivers to designate morphemes for inflectio=
n
in ballads and cadenzas. That moment will also be remembered for the U.S.
avant-garde's first use in a poem of an alarming, unmannered aerial
intonation: a Pedantic drone equipped to utter misguided Hellfire &
Brimstone missives at target audiences its sensors had identified. In that
case, sense and shamelessness had become one and the same.

The View From Above

If they do use this language, U.S. composers would have an unprecedented
view of the linguistic field, provided by a network of spry acolytes readin=
g
from 400 miles in space, Global Hack de-connaissance drones loitering in
65,000 cities, mangled JUSTASS verse-craft poets with moving-tongue
indicators reading 40,000 poetic feet, and Pedantic drones with video-taped
lectures, archaic inferences and breath-line sensors for every 20,000 iambi=
c
feet, all feeding DADA back to commercial centers and, in some cases,
directly to combat verse-craft.

In 1991, such intelligence wouldn't have mattered much: during the Great
Poetic Dearth, more than 90 percent of the poems read were "dumb" poems,
unguided, and they often fell hundreds of feet from their targets.

Now, using the same verse-craft, U.S. poets will be dropping either
laser-guided connotations or the Penguin Poet's new smart poem of choice,
the situationist-guided Juvenile Erection Reference Koncept, or JERK. Unlik=
e
laser-guided metrical scansions, JERKs cannot be blinded by weather or the
dust of the poetic field.

With this new precision-strophe capability, a single verse-craft
practitioner's complement of 50 "fightin' words" can hit more end-rhymes in
one night than hundreds of poets did on the opening night of the Great
Poetic Dearth -- and even Defensive Poetry Undersecretary Donald Hall
himself has deployed five of these metaphors in reference to Persian
Ecstatic Dervish poets.

Along with that capability, the minstrelsy department has significantly
upgraded several key poetic systems.

The Naive School's "Tons-o-hack"  cruel missives=8Bwhich would likely be used
against Academics as they were in 1991, in order to target the rival's most
heavily defended poetic conceits without risking plagarism =ADnow have APS
satellite receivers, which can be programmed with coordinated conjunctions
more rapidly and allow the missives to fly regardless of anomalies in
semantic terrain.

The APA's Apache Long-line Heliotropic Poems have vastly improved readers
who can detect and identify 128 types of poetry on a composition field five
miles away; they will fire new reader-response Hellfire & Brimstone missive=
s
that can latch onto and track moving free-verse poets, much like an
air-to-air whistle. The initial "A" version of the Zukofsky poem starred in
the Great Poetic Dearth, but the APA calculates that the Longliner model is
400 percent more lyrical and 720 percent more able to survive criticism.

The centerpiece of the Academic's campaign is expected to be an array of
baby-boomers, beginning with the Beat-inspired, reader-confusing "B" poem,
which flew its first stanzas in 1999, over Louisville. Each "B" stanza can
carry 16 JERKs, and each JERK can be programmed with coordinated
conjunctions so that each will hit a different tone. They will undoubtedly
be joined by 52 other boomers, who can compose 18 JERKs, and a few Gen-Xers=
,
who can compose 24-verse sestinas.

These are only the most dramatic of dozens of upgrades in poetry ranging
from night-visions, giggles to tangential Pound-forms that enable verse
craft to drop smart references in over 40,000 metrical feet.

"During the Great Poetic Dearth, we were at the beginning of a poetic
revolution," said Capt. Michael Palmer, a veteran figurative poet who is no=
w
skipper of the Pequod. "Since then, it's come on like Adbusters."




Original  piece of 2-16-03,  from the Washington Post:

Unrivaled Military Feels Strains of Unending War For U.S. Forces, a
Technological Revolution and a Constant Call to Do More

By Thomas E. Ricks and Vernon Loeb Washington Post Staff Writers Sunday,
February 16, 2003; Page A18


PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia -- An F-15C fighter rips the bone-dry
air as it roars down the runway, heat-seeking Sidewinder missiles pointing
from its wingtips.

A succession of American technological wizardry quickly follows: an RC-135
"Rivet Joint" reconnaissance plane, for intercepting enemy communications;
EA-6B jets, for jamming enemy radars and radios; F-16CJs, which specialize
in destroying enemy antiaircraft installations, and, finally, a big tanker
aircraft that refuels the "package" of aircraft in midair.

Here on the fringe of the Arabian Desert's forbidding Empty Quarter, this
aerial armada, mobilized to patrol the skies of southern Iraq, is emblemati=
c
of the U.S. military -- which now stands astride the globe more dominant
than any armed force since the legions of the Roman Empire.

Four times over the past 12 years -- in Iraq, in Haiti, in Yugoslavia and i=
n
Afghanistan -- U.S. forces have dispatched enemy forces in a matter of
weeks. Today, on the eve of a possible new war against Iraq, those forces
are exponentially more lethal, and their commanders, who have known little
but victory over their careers, are confident almost to the point of
cockiness.

"At no time in the history of modern warfare has a force been as
well-trained, well-equipped and highly motivated as our Air Force is today,=
"
Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air Force chief of staff, said last month. Indeed,
one of the Air Force's slogans is "Global Reach, Global Power."

That reach, say military commanders and other experts, may also prove to be
an Achilles' heel: The more capable the U.S. military has become, the more
it has been asked to do, and now strains are beginning to show. As the Bush
administration prepares for war with Iraq, it is also sustaining
peacekeeping missions in the Balkans, protecting South Korea from a newly
aggressive North Korea and pursuing a war against terrorism that stretches
from Afghanistan and the Caucasus to the Horn of Africa and Southeast Asia.

This is a period characterized by what seems like continuous warfare,
likened by military analyst Ralph Peters to the Thirty Years War that
decimated Western Europe in the 17th century, and the effects are beginning
to tell on the military's manpower, on its budget, on the nation's treasury=
,
and on a conflict of priorities -- between the need to fight today's wars
and the pursuit of means to dominate tomorrow's.

These tensions are partly the legacy of the nation's response to the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but they will not dissipate any time
soon: They are implicit in the administration's new national security
strategy. That 33-page document, issued in September, commits the nation
both to maintaining U.S. military hegemony and to attacking rogue or
terrorist states before they can threaten the United States.

If the United States does attack Iraq, it would be the first preemptive
strike this nation has ever launched.

Here at Prince Sultan Air Base, the headquarters of U.S. air operations in
the Middle East, there are two different -- but not mutually exclusive --
points of view on the state of the U.S. military.

One warm winter afternoon, Brig. Gen. Dale C. Waters, commander of Air Forc=
e
operations here, drove his big GMC Yukon SUV past F-15 and F-16 fighter jet=
s
lined up on the tarmac and said, "Yeah, I'd say there's a high level of
confidence."

Back at Air Force headquarters on the base, Lt. Col. Matt Molloy, an
animated young F-15 squadron commander, noted that his men and women flew
out of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, South Korea,
Japan, Iceland and the United States -- nine countries -- last year alone.

"We need to put this thing to the north to rest," he said, pointing in the
direction of Iraq. "My airframes are cracking. We are doing too much with
what we've got."

A tour of the military, from the sands of Saudi Arabia to the waters of the
Mediterranean, and from the halls of Congress to the think tanks of nationa=
l
security strategists and academics, shows the sources and extent of U.S.
military might -- and the limitations on it.

'We're Digital Now'

The USS Harry S. Truman, cutting a wide swath through the eastern
Mediterranean, is a 97,000-ton, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier whose deck
is as long as the Empire State Building is tall. But to get an idea of how
far the U.S. military has come since the Persian Gulf War, follow Rear Adm.
John D. Stufflebeem into the ship's cavelike Strike Intelligence Analysis
Center.

In 1991, the Navy carried out airborne photo reconnaissance with "wet" film=
,
which was flown off the ship in canisters for development and
interpretation. Days passed before the intelligence could be put to use.

But the day of the canister is done. "We're digital now," Stufflebeem said
as he walked across the strike center, which was chockablock with computers
and other information systems. One wall was dominated by a screen displayin=
g
real-time black-and-white video images from an unmanned Predator drone over
Afghanistan.

Today, every ship in the Truman's battle group, commanded by Stufflebeem, i=
s
linked to the other -- and to the world beyond -- by satellite-uplinked dat=
a
networks. The carrier's strike aircraft and reconnaissance planes beam
pictures back to the ship, where they are immediately interpreted by eight
"point droppers" -- eight sailors whose jobs didn't exist 12 years ago.

Sitting in the semidarkness of the ship's analysis center, they consult
constantly with intelligence analysts back in the United States, sometimes
using a secure chat room set up for that purpose. Then they determine
coordinates for targets.

Stufflebeem walked to the "precision targeting" workstation to tap a
computer screen displaying the image of a tank. "We can send this
information into the cockpit [of a fighter jet in flight] and say, 'Here's
the coordinates; go strike this target.' " The process, from sensor to
shooter, has been compressed to hours -- and, in some cases, minutes.

This ability -- to add velocity to data -- is the most dramatic improvement
in the U.S. military over the past decade, the one that underlies
overwhelming advances in the speed and accuracy with which those forces can
bring ordnance to bear.

Many military analysts and historians believe that U.S. precision-strike
capabilities, first seen in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, represent the third
"revolution in military affairs" of the 20th century, during which emerging
technologies and new war-fighting concepts changed the nature of war.

The first took place between 1917 and 1939, with the combination of interna=
l
combustion engines, improved aircraft design, radio and radar; it produced
the German blitzkrieg, carrier aviation and strategic aerial bombardment.
The second came at the end of World War II, with the advent of nuclear
weapons. The third is all about precision strikes, information dominance an=
d
near-real-time targeting as the U.S. military leads to the way from
Industrial Age warfare to Information Age operations.

There was a time when mass on the battlefield meant military strength. But
now, with 24-hour battlefield surveillance and instantaneous targeting, mas=
s
on the battlefield is a liability, because it makes forces easier to track
and target.

"High-quality intelligence is the American 21st-century version of mass,"
said Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, director of the National Security Agency.
"With it, we have replaced mass on the battlefield with knowledge and
precision." -------------------------------------- In Afghanistan at the en=
d
of 2001, the fusion of precision weapons and information dominance produced
a new war-fighting concept in which small numbers of Special Operations
soldiers on the ground used laser pointers and Global Positioning System
receivers to designate targets for attack by bombers and fighters. That war
will also be remembered for the U.S. military's first use in combat of an
armed, unmanned aerial vehicle: a Predator drone equipped to fire
laser-guided Hellfire missiles at targets its own sensors had identified. I=
n
that case, sensor and shooter had become one and the same.

In any war against Iraq, U.S. military planners would be expanding on the
lessons learned in Afghanistan.

The View From Above

If they do attack Iraq, U.S. commanders would have an unprecedented view of
the battlefield, provided by a network of spy satellites at 400 miles in
space, Global Hawk reconnaissance drones loitering at 65,000 feet, manned
JSTARS aircraft with moving-target indicator radar at 40,000 feet and
Predator drones with video, infrared and radar sensors at 20,000 feet, all
feeding data back to command centers and, in some cases, directly to combat
aircraft.

In 1991, such real-time intelligence wouldn't have mattered much: During th=
e
Gulf War, more than 90 percent of the bombs dropped were "dumb" bombs,
unguided, and they often fell hundreds of feet from their targets.

Now, using the same aircraft, U.S. pilots will be dropping either
laser-guided bombs or the Pentagon's new smart bomb of choice, the
satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM. Unlike laser-guided
munitions, JDAMs cannot be blinded by weather or the dust of the
battlefield.

With this new precision-strike capability, a single aircraft carrier's
complement of 50 fighter jets can hit more targets in one night than
hundreds of aircraft did on the opening night of the Gulf War -- and Defens=
e
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has deployed five carriers to the Persian Gulf
region.

Along with that capability, the military has significantly upgraded several
key weapons systems.

The Navy's Tomahawk cruise missiles -- which would likely be used against
Iraq as they were in 1991, to target the enemy's most heavily defended air
defenses without risking pilots -- now have GPS satellite receivers, which
can be programmed with coordinates more rapidly and allow the missiles to
fly regardless of anomalies in terrain.

The Army's Apache Longbow helicopter gunships have vastly improved radars
that can detect and identify 128 targets on a battlefield five miles away;
they will fire new radar-guided Hellfire missiles that can lock onto and
track moving targets, much like an air-to-air missile. The initial "A"
version of the Apache starred in the Gulf War, but the Army calculates that
the Longbow model is 400 percent more lethal and 720 percent more able to
survive combat.

The centerpiece of the Air Force's campaign is expected to be an array of
bombers, beginning with the bat-winged, radar-evading B-2, which flew its
first combat missions in 1999, over Kosovo. Each B-2 can carry 16 JDAMs, an=
d
each JDAM can be programmed with coordinates to hit a different target. The=
y
will undoubtedly be joined by B-52 bombers, which can carry 18 JDAMs, and
B-1 bombers, which can carry 24.

These are only the most dramatic of dozens of upgrades in equipment ranging
from night-vision goggles to targeting pods that enable aircraft to drop
smart bombs from 40,000 feet.

"During the Gulf War, we were at the beginning of a technological
revolution," said Capt. Michael Groothousen, a veteran fighter pilot who is
now skipper of the Truman. "Since then, it's come on like gangbusters."
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------- The success of that revolution accounts for so
much besides the military's sheer strength: its confidence, its
professionalism, the better-educated men and women in the ranks -- and the
number of those men and women.

At the end of World War II, there were 12 million troops on active duty.
Today, with the nation's population doubled in size, there are just 1.4
million.

Even since the Gulf War, the military has shrunk by about one-third. The
force waging the current continuous campaign is surprisingly small.

We also had a small rally (some 300-strong; that's minus the five busses
that went to NYC) on Saturday at Bidwell and Elmwood here in Buffalo-- same
spot where I've been standing with Women in Black once a week for sixteen
months now-- in the chill 12 degree air. It was energetic and inspiring,
even for a small crowd, and recalled for me, yes, how little numbers count
for next to the more intangible historical buzz-- a steadfast moment of
simultaneity I felt coursing through the calls and response between crowd
and speakers.  (My contribution to the sloganfest: "No Blitz for
Wolfowitz.")

There was some showing from Poetics (I spotted five hardy poets: Doug
Manson, Barbara Cole, Gregg Biglieri, Sarah Campbell, Eric Gelsinger), alon=
g
with many familiar, and unfamiliar, Buffalo faces, and a general warmth
extending to the honks of traffic in reponse to vigorous waving of signs
(SUVs' windows passing in sinister and obscure silence).  This was before
we'd heard of the true extent of the world protests (though word of the
amazing London rally had certainly come in): the energy felt germinal to a
moment springing, almost, from the ground to flourish in the radiant winter
sun.  If you were there, you were in the world.

In a more sober moment, I wrote the following assessment.

EMPIRE AT THE BRINK: A CALL TO ACTION

We stand truly at an historical juncture, with several directions mapped
before us, and several more unknown. Yesterday's protests demonstrated an
immense will for peace around the world, a growing sense "the people" have
had enough. While immensely inspiring, the moment also calls for a clarity
of mind, to assess the powers before and behind us, as well as within, and
the road ahead. We must not underestimate the technological and ideological
behemoth massed at the borders of Iraq and lodged in the minds of the men
who command it. =20

At the same time as free (and some not-so-free) countries around the world
allowed their citizens to mass in peaceful protest, the forces of
liberalization=8Bmanifested in the superiority of American air, ballistics an=
d
communications power=8Bappear ready to take a calculated risk with
liberalism's next logical step across the globe. (I discuss the largely
symbolic, though still significant, distinctions between "liberalism" and
"imperialism" below.)  To wit: if American and British (plus any other
willing coalition's) troops are "met in Baghdad by Iraqis lining the street
in celebration," then Blair and Bush's increasingly-reviled faces will enjo=
y
a dramatic and successful makeover (Schell).  Even North Korea, with its
fledgling nuclear weapons program, or Iran, with its intractable
fundamentalist regime, will be unable to resist a seemingly implacable
forward march of history.

The strategy is one of three-step brinkmanship:  1) overwhelming force is
massed, preferably by a unanimous international coalition, so persuasively
that the resisting regime finally backs down and goes into exile; 2) barrin=
g
that, the regime is isolated (as in Kosovo) and the air and communications
environment so dominated by the "liberating" forces that the regime implode=
s
under popular pressure; 3) when this strategy fails (as, debatably, in
Iraq), an invasion becomes necessary to remove the regime by force.  The
U.S. and its key UN (as well as NATO) partners do NOT disagree on the
fundamentals of this strategy: the differences are of timing, and of which
of the three steps at present to push (though there is an understandable
reluctance on the part of the allies to allow a unilateral U.S. progression
to step three, which reluctance I discuss at length below).  The U.S.,
Britain and a handful of European allies with little to contribute and much
to gain from supporting the effort, are clearly pushing for steps one and/o=
r
three.  France, Germany, Russia and China, amongst others, seem to think th=
e
resources of step two have not yet been exhausted.  If, in fact, warfare is
increasingly a technological race to dominate the communications sphere (De
Landa), then why make haste to draw blood?  Can we not just step up the
surveillance and monitoring (U2 fly-overs, teams of inspectors on the groun=
d
backed by troops, etc.) to the point of squeezing the life out of the Baath
regime?  The goal is the same--promoting democracy through the threat of
"overwhelming force"--but without the risks implicit in the inherent
unpredictability of warfare and the ensuing military occupation.  Haven't w=
e
learned to use our guns without firing them?

The U.S. argues that steps one and two appear unlikely, if not
impossible--twelve years of sanctions having only broken the Iraqi people
and hardened Hussein's grip on power, rather than inspiring, as hoped, a
popular revolt; and the rough ideological terrain obviously requiring
oversight, deeply divided as it is between Shiite, Kurd, Sunni and secular
concerns, promising little in the way of a "spontaneous" transition to
democracy.  But U.S.-led force has another, more intrinsic reason for havin=
g
no options but step three:  until tested in the battlefield, the U.S. will
not truly be able to "deploy" its intended domination of the global
communications sphere (De Landa). The U.S. will not decisively have
demonstrated to the world its undisputed military-technological superiority
(=E0 la Hiroshima and Nagasaki--cf. Ullman; Afghanistan was a start but also
disappointingly easy in its initial phase), and it will not be able to
progress to the next stage of research and development without testing its
innovations in the field.

Just as Gulf War I was, in the main, a showcase for the new technology of
"smart bombs," Episode II promises to open a new theatre of digitized "real
time" command-to-operations communications and space-based, as well as
autonomous ("intelligent") artillery operations:

If they do attack Iraq, U.S. commanders would have an unprecedented view of
the battlefield, provided by a network of spy satellites at 400 miles in
space, Global Hawk reconnaissance drones loitering at 65,000 feet, manned
JSTARS aircraft with moving-target indicator radar at 40,000 feet and
Predator drones with video, infrared and radar sensors at 20,000 feet, all
feeding data back to command centers and, in some cases, directly to combat
aircraft. (Ricks and Loeb)

The U.S. Administration has to toe a line between minimizing civilian
casualties, and maximizing the overwhelming effect of the new technology
("Shock and Awe"):  not an easy line to walk (Ullman et al).  The risks are
great--on the side of U.S. forces, with inevitable glitches in the
technology on which these forces are increasingly dependent, including new
vulnerabilities implicit in open architecture cyberware (a trade-off for
stability), and with increasing strain and fatigue on "volunteer" human
resources stretched thin and worked to the breaking point (De Landa, Ricks
and Loeb); on the Iraqi side, with the question of Hussein's willingness to
use whatever stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons he does harbor o=
n
his own people and/or the invading forces, plus his demonstrated willingnes=
s
to use his own people as "human shields" for military targets--but the risk=
s
of inaction, of failing to complete the step to global communications
hegemony, are, by this zero-sum logic of military dominance, far greater.

Whether this is a dominance of "liberalism" or "imperialism" in part depend=
s
on success in patching over an increasingly evident mid-Atlantic rift:
while in some respects the disagreement with France, Germany, Russia and
China is one of means, in other respects it signals a potentially far more
serious rift.  As Jonathan Schell argues in his latest piece for Harper's o=
n
the "futility of war," the closest historical analogue for the present
moment would be not, as is generally argued in camps both for and against
the war, 1938, but, rather, 1945--in particular, the period between the
drafting of the outlines of a U.N. Charter at the San Francisco Conference
on International Organization in April of that year, and the destruction of
Hiroshima on August 6.  U.S. deployment of the atomic bomb effectively
rendered the U.N., which came into existence on October 24, 1945, irrelevan=
t
as a governing body.  Today, the United States' rival powers (rival being a
very relative term here) understandably hope, however quixotically, to
forestall as long as possible a decisive U.S. victory in the race to
"space-based" military hegemony.  France, for example, is currently working
on its own versions of the new high-powered "microwave" weaponry the U.S.
reportedly will test out in a war on Iraq.

Europe would like to perpetuate the '90's facade of a "liberal" coalition
that at the same time enables a sharing of its de facto imperial benefits
(Anderson).  In this light, Blair's stubborn embrace of the U.S. program,
awkwardly reaching across the Atlantic chasm, is both a calculated
realization of the inevitability of U.S. hegemony ("empire") and a "heroic"
attempt to keep Europe on board, and thus, to sustain the hopes of
"liberalism."  In "Force and Consent" Perry Anderson has argued that the
death of any democratic elements of "liberalism" went down long ago, in an
effectively imperial "Americanization" of the planet sugar-coated with a
palaver of humanitarian and democratizing high-mindedness; nevertheless, a
unilateral (or bilateral) "preemptive" U.S. strike will still mark a
critical turning point.  The discourse of liberalism will be dealt a fatal
blow in the "theatre of operations" as the U.S. demonstrates its unrivaled
power and, more importantly, its will to use that power in flagrant
disregard of the will of the international community.  The "liberal" system
of international alliances will be discredited, and fundamentalist or other
popular resistances to U.S. imperialism will be emboldened.  At the same
time, a successful "liberation" of Iraq, under the new sign of empire, woul=
d
bring potent viability to the notion of a Pax Americana (Anderson). The U.S=
.
"showdown" in Iraq has significantly MORE to do with these kinds of
calculations (outlined in The National Security Strategy of the United
States) than with either Saddam Hussein or evident U.S. oil interests in th=
e
region. =20

To dispense with "old Europe's" liberalism does seem like madness, and the
possibility of this has brought the world's liberals (who supported the
bombings of Kosovo and Afghanistan) into a now-mainstream anti-war
movement--but the end of liberalism is built into the logic, strategic as
well as tactical, of U.S. militarization, and it is also a step impelled by
frankly theocratic elements in the current U.S. administration. A convictio=
n
that the U.S. has been "chosen" to lead the world to "freedom" apparently
outweighs the potentially fatal results of choosing to scrap old alliances.
It is all or nothing: a brinkmanship with a fearful God where only inaction
is unforgivable.  What matters is to assume the righteous cause; the
righteous who lose themselves, or the world, in the process, will be
forgiven; but the righteous will prevail, confident in their faith--or so
the screed goes.  In many respects, the fate of the world hangs on the
outcome of an old ideological debate internal to the dominant "culture" of
the United States . . . between the "moral majority" and its more secular
counterparts.  It is a debate that may already have been decided in the
elections of 2000 and 2002.  The economics of U.S. militarization also have
a large role to play in the outcome.  Strains internal to the military as
well as on an already precarious U.S. economy, of a $1 billion-per-day
deployment, are tremendous and cannot be sustained for long (Ricks and
Loeb).  All of these factors--a militarized strategy for global dominance,
extremist theocratic tendencies within at least two, if not all three
branches of the U.S. government, and the material momentum of military
buildup itself--come together in a decision for military action in Iraq; al=
l
that holds the U.S. back are the liberal interests of international backing
and (which is part of this) some friction provided by an alliance with the
Blair administration--a friction which may become more apparent as the U.S.
moves toward decisive action.

Or IS that all that holds the U.S. back?  Popular manifestations of
opposition to U.S. imperialism around the world are the largest they have
been in thirty years, dwarfing the anti-globalization protests of the '90's=
,
and this movement is just getting underway.  If such opposition is merely a
drag on an inevitable U.S. attack, and if the U.S. calculation succeeds wit=
h
even the moderate success that has been encountered in Afghanistan, then
such popular opposition will swiftly evaporate. (It would be interesting to
know how many of this weekend's protesters would support a multilateral
operation in Iraq.)  If, however, a U.S. operation in Iraq encounters any
serious setbacks, then popular opposition could become full-scale.
Dissension if not outright mutiny within the U.S. military is even possible=
.
Finally, if popular dissent is earnest about actually stopping the U.S.
military machine before it goes to the brink, then several questions need t=
o
be asked up front--all posed under the general rubric of asking whether,
indeed, "the people have the power."

1) As I have already asked, to what extent are the current demonstrations a
continuation of the critique of "liberalism" manifested in the pre-9/11
"anti-globalization" protests?  Or is the much-celebrated, new ideological
diversity of these protests, at its mainstream core, largely a response to
the threat of unilateral U.S. sabotage of that status quo?

2) To what extent was the "velvet revolution" across Central and Eastern
Europe (as well as peaceful revolutions in other parts of the globe) a
"flowering," as Jonathan Schell claims, of "liberal democratic" nonviolent
action? Or was it, as U.S. hardline strategists obviously believe, a gift o=
f
the U.S. "defeat" of the Soviet Union through economic, military and
technological might?  The official line is, of course, a bit of both.  But
nonviolent activists in the U.S. would do well to break that history down
and assess the odds, as they move forward with actions modeled on such
precedents. The same goes for the much-invoked examples of Mahatma Gandhi,
Martin Luther King, or Nelson Mandela.

3) Demonstrations have so far been "legal" or "permitted" and the
authorities have, in the main, handled protestors with kid gloves.  An
effective campaign of nonviolent "non-cooperation" will, when push comes to
shove, inevitably involve mass civil disobedience (and mass arrests).  In
what way will the new tools (cf. USA PATRIOT Act, "Uniting and Strengthenin=
g
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism") of what is now effectively a U.S. police state be applied to
such demonstrators?  What is the critical mass that would deter authorities
from locking up or otherwise silencing dissenters, and is such a mass
attainable?  What support could U.S. dissenters count on from the
international community?

4)  The odds of popular revolution are strengthened by a perhaps unintended
side-effect of communications technology: the possibility for instantaneous
coordination around the planet.  This weekend's rallies--millions of people
marching in the U.S., South Africa, Ireland, Scotland, England, Norway, the
Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Italy, Bosnia,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ukraine, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt,
Israel, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, South
Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and a host of other countries--were
coordinated in less than five weeks.  The popular will for peace, a
collective assertion that the zero-sum game of military conflict is a
dead-end for the planet, seems to cut across many ideological and cultural
barriers. Have these new circumstances even begun to be exploited?  How muc=
h
can the "unpredictable" nature of the new, asymmetrical global terrain be
counted on?

U.S. military brinkmanship thus operates in at least two directions at once=
.
It seems ready to dissolve old liberal alliances like the United Nations or
even NATO, but it also may be provoking a popular solidarity across the
globe, the likes of which have never been seen before.  For those who oppos=
e
U.S. imperialism, the riskiest course of action is inaction, to "wait and
see" what happens in Iraq.  The uncertainties of that venture are
terrifying; but the worst possible, and most likely, outcome would be a
swift and successful victory for the U.S. (Anderson). A fiasco would be
second worst, entailing possibly dire consequences but also new room for
change (the "things have to get much worse before they get better" outlook)=
.

The popular will for peace needs to be tested and encouraged by a clear
education in the likely scenarios and the long-term issues at stake, which
includes a frank discussion of the undersides of a Pax Americana and/or
"liberal" democracy, along the lines of the "anti-globalization" critiques
vocal just two years ago--foregrounding environmental, labor and social
justice, as well as human rights, issues.  And that momentum thus clarified=
,
spurred by the U.S. administration's brinkmanship, needs to be rallied to
fearless and overwhelming nonviolent force--something along the lines of a
national strike. Otherwise it will remain merely symbolic if the U.S.
succeeds in Iraq, or unprepared in the case of a disastrous outcome.

At this very moment we are living a critical historical juncture; the seeds
of the future are latent right now in the actions of each and every human
being on this planet.  The moment is not lost on violent militarized states
and terrorists; will the powerful forces of nonviolence, for their part,
allow this uncertain moment to slip by?  Last weekend's outpouring was a
call to get in the streets and stay in the streets, and not to shrink from
power when it comes marching with its clubs and its chemicals.  I, for one,
do not intend to be a spectator, to let the dogs of war have the upper
hand--while the rest of us sit around, to "wait and see" what will "happen"
on TV.  Do you?

OK, I admit, I'm pretty bummed no one mentioned the two best protest signs
of the weekend, carried up Market St. by myself and Del Ray Cross.

Del's: GIVE US BACK OUR MONICA LEWINSKY

Jim's: PLEASE PEPPERSPRAY ME (front)
       GUESS WHERE THE BUCK STOPS: EVERYWHERE (back)

After the peace march Del and I were walking to Kevin and Dodie's house and
as we passed through Market and 8th St. we witnessed some penultimate
moments just before a standoff between an anarchist splinter group and the
San Francisco police got ugly.  We couldn't cross that intersection, the
cops had everything surrounded.  We turned down 8th and headed for Mission
just as the crowd started a light, eerie chant of "Our Street."  A lot of
the euphoria I felt after marching in such a terrific parade faded.  We saw
a police van quietly speed up 9th Ave and I knew those kids were gonna get
it.

See full page ad in Sunday Feb 9, 2003, taken out by Wendell Berry.
He begins his article with an analysis of GWB's use of "we."  Very
instructive.  "While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the
support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if
necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively
against such terrorists..."    GWB
       Berry goes on with, "A democratic citizen must deal here first with
the question, Who is this 'we'?  It is not the 'we' of the Declaration of
Independence, which referred to a small group of signatories bound by the
conviction that 'governments [derive] their just powers from the consent of
the governed' . And it is not the 'we' of the Constitution, which refers to
the 'people [his emphasis] of the United States'.
       "This 'we' of the new strategy can refer only to the president.  It is
a royal 'we'.

Barrett:

The first strategy of a country about to make war on another is to make an
abstraction of the people it is planning to kill. The reverse is true too.
The first thing the US media did after 9/11 was to make the victims real and
discrete. Thus, as Lytle and Emilie know, it is the abstraction of Iraqis
that must be resisted. The pictures of these people, reading their names,
and talking about who they are, would have been more powerful than the usual
celebrities giving the usual speeches.

I think it's the 'we' Teddy Roosevelt used to charge up San Juan Hill while
his boss was out sick, unfortunately.  [I may be wrong in my sorting out of
memories of poorly digested history books here]

Is Wendell's ad available on the net?

Great! The gov surveillance appropriationist "aerial flaneur."  Amazingly I
am sure some of the devices you describe will become true & good resources =
&
tools.
One legend says Punk rock took its sound from shoulder held rocket-launcher=
s
- who would have ever thought? I wonder, actually, what kind of sound a
"Drone" makes. One Dict def defines "drone" as "to make a dull, continuous,
monotonous sound; to speak in a dull or monotonous tone". I guess that's Ar=
i
Fleisher in a nut-shell.
 Not aesthetically promising unless manipulated by a non-drone. When Ari F
breaks down hysterically screaming and crying in a White House press
briefing - I guess, in the power of public protest, we non-drones  will hav=
e
done part of the job.

UbuWeb Presents RADIO RADIO
--------------------------------------

http://ubu.com/radio


RADIO RADIO is a sixteen-part series of forty-five minute broadcasts focused on sound
artists. The series features innovative radio producers, sound poets and audio artists in
conversation and performance: Gregory Whitehead, Stephen Erickson, Jennifer & Kevin
McCoy, cris cheek, Charles Bernstein, John Oswald, Bob Cobbing, Christof Migone, Michael
Basinski, Sianed Jones, Piers Plowright, Paul D. Miller (a.k.a DJ Spooky), Lawrence
Upton, Bufffluxus and Jane Draycott & Elizabeth James. Available in MP3 and streaming
RealAudio. Produced by Martin Spinelli.


Program 1:  Gregory Whitehead has created remarkable sound for radio, the stage and the
gallery for over twenty years. His more than one-hundred radio plays, essays and
performances notably include Dead Letters, Pressures of the Unspeakable (winner of a Prix
Italia) and Shake Rattle Roll (winner of a Prix Futura).  He has written extensively on
the unique qualities of "radio art" and co-edited the seminal radio criticism anthology
Wireless Imagination.

Program 2:  Stephen Erickson has produced perhaps the best documentaries heard on radio
in the past twenty-five years and garnered numerous awards in the process (most
significantly a Gramy for his audio work on Ken Burns's series The Civil War).  His Radio
Radio program features samples from his programs Forbidden Voyage, The Exile of Braten
Braten Bach, Airworks and The Blue Wall of Silence: the New York Police Department.

Program 3:  Jennifer & Kevin McCoy are Brooklyn-based artist who cycle, repeat and morph
pop-culture tropes and images.  Their series of microradio installations conflate gallery
patrons with pirate radio listeners while ironically tweaking the language of novels like
Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and the corporate-promo-speak of the web.  In New York
City their work has been exhibited at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, P.S.1, Postmasters
Gallery, The New Museum and other venues.

Program 4:  cris cheek is a sound poet, performer, curator and SONY Award winner.  He has
collaborated on the Slant series of CDs and has created soundtracks (or languagetracks)
for choreographers such as Michael Clarke, Kirstie Simpson, Miranda Tufnell, Lisa Nelson,
Patricia Bardi, Mary Prestidge, Sue MacLennan and Julyen Hamilton.  In his Radio Radio
program cheek discusses "performance writing" and plays/performs "Public Announcement,"
"How Can this Hum Be Human" and other pieces.

Program 5:  Charles Bernstein is a poet, critic and formerly the David Gray Chair of
Poetry and Letters at SUNY Buffalo, now professor of poetry at the University of
Pennsylvania.  He is Executive Director of the Electronic Poetry Center and (perhaps most
famously) he produced with Bruce Andrews The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book which gave rise to its
own genre of writing.  On his Radio Radio program he performs selections from his book
With Strings, his opera Shadowtime about the life of Walter Benjamin, and "Dear Mr.
Finelli."

Program 6:  John Oswald's 1989 CD Plunderphonics spawned a new category of music which
samples not just pop songs, but their cultural contexts as well.  Since then Oswald has
refined his "electroquoting" on the CDs Greyfolded, Electrax, Discosphere, Plexure and
the recently released Plunderphonics box set.  In his Radio Radio program he talks about
the legal machinations that have surrounded his work and plays a range of examples.

Program 7:  Bob Cobbing was a fixture on the London literary scene from the late 1940s
until his death in 2002.  Despite being the publisher of Writers Forum, having produced
hundreds of books of poetry and pieces of visual art, and more-or-less inventing the
concept of the "sound text," he made remarkably few inroads into either institutionalized
art culture or academe.  His Radio Radio program is his last broadcast interview.

Program 8:  Christof Migone is a composer, performer and radio artist who heads the
Centre for Radiotelecommunication Contortions (CRTC) where the voice of his radio body
hems, haws, slurps, clicks, breaths, contorts, cuts, modulates and masticates.  His CDs
include South Winds, Undo and Radio Folie/Culture.  On Radio Radio he plays selections
from his other CDs Hole in the Head, Vex and the Death of Analogies.

Program 9:  Michael Basinski sounds the poetry in "chart junk," the printers' ding-bats,
wing-dings and odd typefaces found in any casual scroll through your word processor's
font list.  For more than twenty years he has performed choral voice collages and sound
texts with his intermedia performance ensemble The Ebma; The Ebma has released two Lps:
SEA and Enjambment.

Program 10:  Sianed Jones & cris cheek are poets, musicians and multi-media artists who
have collaborated on the Slant series of CDs and performances.  For Radio Radio they
present and discuss several versions of their book/CD/performance project Navigations in
Sound and discuss how in-situ studies of ethnopoetics have contributed to their own
performance styles.

Program 11:  Piers Plowright worked for thirty years as a BBC producer of dramas,
documentaries and innovative features before setting out as an independent producer.
During this time his elegant and hybridized programs have won several SONY Awards and
three of radio's most significant award the Prix Italia.  On Radio Radio he talks about
the evolution and the future of the medium and plays samples of his work from throughout
his career.

Program 12:  Paul D. Miller, A.K.A. DJ Spooky, is a writer, visual artist and
platinum-selling recording artist.  His mixes blend black radio and cartoon soundtracks
with vintage recordings of Thomas Edison and manage a rare combination of street
credibility and critical sensibility.  In his program he discusses "the mix" as culture
and as metaphor.

Program 13:  Lawrence Upton is the curator of London's long-running Subvoicive Poetry
series.  Upton has been making poetry for nearly four decades and works in a variety of
writing genres. He divides his time between London, where he was born, and the west of
Cornwall and Scilly, where his family originates. His most recent collection, Wire
Sculptures, is published by Reality Street Editions.

Program 14:  Jane Draycott & Elizabeth James have been collaborating on radio poetry
projects for several years.  Their work has been heard on the BBC and on stations and
networks around the world.  Draycott's latest collection Tideway (Two Rivers Press) is a
collaboration with artist Peter Hay. A sound montage made during the writing of the book
features in the Summer 2002 issue of Boomerang UK.  James's poetry has been published by
Vennel Press, Form Books and Writers Forum (the latest being Recognition, 1999). Her
other collaborative projects include:  Neither the One Nor the Other with Frances Presley
and 'Two Renga' with Peter Manson.

Program 15:  The BuffFluxux ensemble consisted of Matt Chambers, Rick Royer, Mark Peters,
Natalie Basinski and Mike Basinski at the time of this recording.  Based in Buffalo, New
York, they have performed at venues throughout North America and Europe.  For their Radio
Radio program they perform "Five Minutes of Eternity," "Breath Song of the Soil Fungi"
and "Shit Piece."

Program 16:  Bob Cobbing & Lawrence Upton had worked together on Writers Forum for over
thirty years and had been collaborating sound and voice performers for nearly as long.
Together they produced the seminal sound-text anthology Word Score Utterance Choreography
and the pamphlet series Domestic Ambient Noise from which they perform during their Radio
Radio program.

Usually I just lurk, but I must confess that when I taught a September
11th seminar, we spent a lot of time on the pronouns in Bush's speeches.

I think it's considerably more complex than a case of the "royal we."  He
moves a lot between the executive "I" and the empathetic "we" in the
aftermath of the disaster.  And check out all the different ways he uses
"you"!

Anyway, I wrote a hypetext article about the seminar in _Kairos_
at http://english.ttu.edu/kairos/7.2/binder.html?sectionone/losh

You can see some of the stuff about pronouns under "ethos" in the _Kairos_
article and under "student final comments" at the bottom of the course
syllabus at http://eee.uci.edu/faculty/losh/syllabi/

I wrote part of my dissertation on pronouns in Oppen, so I'm glad to
discover that there are other similarly obsessed people.

FW: TWO ARRESTED FOR POSTING PICTURES OF IRAQIS IN NEW YORK CITY

February 17, 2003

TWO ARRESTED FOR POSTING PICTURES OF IRAQIS IN NEW YORK CITY

(NEW YORK CITY)- Artist Emilie Clark and writer Lytle Shaw were arrested
for posting pictures of people from Baghdad in Soho late Thursday night.
Both have been released. A court date has been set to prosecute the two
for showing New York City the people who will die in a possible war
against Iraq.

Clark and Shaw were members of the Baghdad Snapshot Action Crew. Based
in New York City, the crew of 75 artists and activists began posting
simple flyers with pictures of ordinary Iraqi citizens around New York
City, in anticipation and solidarity of the February 15th anti-war
rally.

The pictures were taken by artist Paul Chan, who recently returned from
Baghdad as a member of the Iraq Peace Team, a project of the Chicago
based, Nobel Peace Prize nominated activist group, Voices in the
Wilderness.

Clark and Shaw were taping the letter sized flyer on a lamppost at the
corner of Mercer and Prince Streets when three undercover policemen
arrested them. They were charged with criminal misdemeanors. Shaw was
released after five and a half hours. Clark spent seven hours in jail
before her release. Clark is pregnant with her first son, and is
expecting this Spring.

The arrests were a clear attempt by the police to intimidate New Yorkers
to stay away from the protest. "If there wasn't a march on Saturday we
wouldn't have been arrested.," Shaw said. While in custody, police
harassed Clark and Shaw with talk about how dangerous the rally will be.
"They kept saying how mace was going to be used on all the protesters,"
Clark said. "And then they said they had heard suicide bombers might
attack the rally."

What was most disturbing to Shaw was how the cops tried to justify their
actions against the two. "They tried to appeal to us sentimentally,"
Shaw said, "as though the repression they were enacting was really in
our best interest."

"They wanted to send a message that we should stay home because it [the
protest] was dangerous, and they didn't want to see us hurt."

The court date is set for March 13.

Leftover from yesterday's hip-hop/poetry discussion:

Actually, I DO like rap and never said that I didn't,
and I can acknowledge that elements of both affect the
other, processes don't occur in a vacuum. However, I
wasn't trying to say other views are invalid, I was
simply stating my opinion. It's fascinating how
passionate people can be and I think that's a good
sign for the state of poetry, regardless of differing
views. All this aside, I do feel, whether they are
connected are not, rap is its own form, and cannot
replace poetry. Poetry has its own validity which I
worry will be lost if they it's simply replaced by a
different art form. I see stating your opinion can be
pretty dangerous around here.

Paris Connection examines the art of a loosely-knit group of six Parisian web.artists who,
individually and collaboratively, are producing some of the most vibrant and challenging work on
the Web today. Via interviews, profiles, essays, interactive works, graphical explorations, and
links to the actual works, Paris Connection offers perspectives on the artists, individually and
as a group, within the broader context of contemporary art.

Paris Connection is presented in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish; it is co-produced and
co-published by sites in Toronto, New York, Berlin, and Rio; the 15 person production network is
located in Canada, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Paris Connection is a strong and optimistic statement about the international dimensions of the
Internet and presents art and commentary on that art which pushes the boundaries of expression
and understanding.

There will be an online chat amongst the artists, producers, production network, press, and
whomever wants to show up. The chat is at any of the above URLS (click on discuss>chat) at the
following time:

13:00:00 Sun Feb 23 2003 in US/Eastern time
15:00:00 Sun Feb 23 2003 in Rio time
19:00:00 Sun Feb 23 2003 in Europe/Paris time
See http://www.timeconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc to calculate the time in your area.

ARTISTS: Jean-Jacques Birgé; Antoine Schmitt; Nicolas Clauss; Frédéric Durieu; servovalve; and
Jean-Luc Lamarque.

WRITERS: Paris Connection contains writing by Jim Andrews of vispo.com and coriolisweb.org in
Toronto; Helen Thorington of turbulence.org in New York; Regina Célia Pinto of arteonline.arq.br
in Rio, Brazil; and Roberto Simanowski of dichtung-digital.org in Berlin. Paris Connection also
contains writing by Carrie Noland, a scholar of French literature at the University of
California who has written Poetry at Stake: Lyric Aesthetics and the Challenge of Technology
(Princeton University Press), which explores historical poetic attempts to redefine the
relationship between subjective expression and mechanical reproduction.

PRODUCERS: Regina Célia Pinto's arteonline.arq.br is one of the main nodes on the Web for
cross-fertilization between South American and North American web.art; Thorington's
turbulence.org is well-known for its long-time commitment to commissioning, exhibiting and
archiving works by artists exploring the networked medium; and Simanowski's
dichtung-digital.org, published in German and English, concentrates on critical writing about
international digital literature and art. Paris Connection is the first publication of
coriolisweb.org.

Since today was pretty much the biggest coordinated protest (correct me
if I'm wrong) in the history of the planet, I made a two-page poster out
of the list of 603 cities listed as participating. To commemorate the
very many events that took place, and to point to what the mainstream
media will inevitably do a good job of ignoring.

I included crowd estimates of some of the bigger demos (many over 1
million!). (I had trouble finding figures for S. America. Those will be
added asap.)

John Matthias alerted me to the death of Peter Russell a few weeks ago.
Richard Burns has now sent the full text of his obituary, a portion of
which was published in The Independent on January 28, 2003, with the hope
it will be of interest to the wider poetry community.

I have put the full text of Burns's obituary at the EPC:

John Gery's very informative recent review of Russell appeared in Notre
Dame Review #14 and is available at:

& 50 cent seems to have the spirit of Bukowski down with the

---> UPDATES <---

BOOKS & PUBLICATIONS, BOOKSELLERS & PUBLISHERS ---> The Montreal Bookfair
Organizing Collective is making an extra effort to obtain anarchist,
anti-authoritarian and left-libertarian literature, magazines, books, and
zines, in English, French and Spanish, from all over the world. While not
all booksellers or distributors might be able to attend the bookfair in
person, the bookfair collective will try to have these items available for
distribution and sale at the bookfair. Please pass on your tips, leads and
contacts to bookfair2003@ziplip.com.

BOOKFAIR TABLES ---> This year's new bookfair location will have more
space, but tables will still be limited. If you want to have space at the
bookfair, PLEASE RESERVE IN ADVANCE. You can reserve table space by
writing bookfair2003@ziplip.com. Please write us before April 1, 2003, and
please include a brief description of your group, as well as how much
table space you might need. Bookfair tables will be charged a fee, based
on a sliding scale.

HELP WITH PUBLICITY ---> If you are able to promote the Montreal Anarchist
Bookfair locally (distributing flyers and posters), please get in touch,
and we'll send you materials. If you maintain a webpage, we encourage you
to link to our site: http://www.tao.ca/~lombrenoire. And, if you
publishing a magazine, paper or zine before May 2003, let us know if
you're willing to run a promotion for the Montreal Bookfair.

MONTREAL-AREA POSTERING ---> Each year, the bookfair collective aims to
poster widely throughout Montreal, including outlying neighborhoods. If
you can help with postering efforts, please get in touch.

WORKSHOPS ---> Again this year, the Anarchist Bookfair will include
several workshops. Introductory-style workshops will take place on May 17
(at 2515, rue Delisle during the bookfair itself), while more in-depth
workshops will take place on May 18 at 1710, rue Beaudry. If you would
like to present a workshop, please send along your workshop proposal
BEFORE March 17th to bookfair2003@ziplip.com. Your proposal should include
a title, workshop description, language of workshop, and mini-bio of the
presenters.

about your events before April 1, 2003, to coordinate the calendar of
events. To date, the following Festival of Anarchy events are scheduled to
take place:

Actually, thinking of rap as poetry is not radical.
I'm sure many people who care about either would
agree. And of course it has poetic elements, but I
also think it is it's own thing. My point is being
missed in favor of tangential arguments, so I give up.

caught in possession of thoughts



in the first book of myths, the day was a compromise, the edge a grave
diggers spade. ridicule came from

  the airways pumping blood that canceled the previous foretold.  weeds
where replaced with something

form, an armored body,  or golden vertigo madness. I felt the
compromise again, those placenta headlines,

and the winds of the flatlands that turned darkness to a sound without
ends. the cold froze my hands to

murder cut-off from pain. suddenly the morning was burning with
impotence on a fake landscape. tickets

where sold for the battlefield, the body torn to shreds. I had to
answer to my parts scattered across a

temporary phenomena. there was a cinematic climax, souls isolated and
questions flogged and gagged.

there was another compromise and the day begun again. in the first book
of myths, on the edge a grave

diggers spade . . .

Please join us as the spring season of the Poetic Research series =
begins!
(See entire series at bottom.)

***

The Germ and the Poetic Research Bloc present:

Jerome Rothenberg & Walter K. Lew

Sunday, February 23 at 4pm at Dawson's Book Shop!

***
Jerome Rothenberg is an internationally known poet and the author of =
over
sixty books of poetry and a number of breakthrough anthologies of
experimental and traditional poetries (Technicians of the Sacred, =
Shaking
the Pumpkin, Poems for the Millennium, etc.).  He was a founding figure =
of
ethnopoetics as a combination of poetic practice and theory, and he has =
been
a longtime practitioner of poetry performance in frequent =
collaborations
with performers like Bertram Turetzky and Charlie Morrow and with =
groups
like the Living Theater and the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (Cologne).  The =
Lorca
Variations works with a redistribution of vocabulary from Rothenberg's
translations of the great Spanish modernist poet, Federico Garc=EDa =
Lorca,
while That Dada Strain starts as a tribute to the Dada poets of Europe, =
who
were instrumental in opening up new forms of creativity while debunking
older forms of artistic repression.  The occurence of Dada in the midst =
of
the first world war and the martyrdom of Lorca at the time of the =
Spanish
Civil War and Great American Depression are also crucial to a reading =
of
these works.  A Book of Witness, Jerome Rothenberg twelfth book of =
poems
from New Directions, will be published in April

Walter K. Lew's most recent book is Treadwinds: Poems and Intermedia =
Texts
(Wesleyan U. Press, 2002) Earlier books include Excerpts from: ?IKTH =
DIKTE,
for DICTEE (1982) (1992), a critical artist's book on the work of =
Theresa
Hak Kyung Cha, K=F4ri: The Beacon Anthology of Korean American Fiction,
co-edited with Heinz Insu Fenkl (Beacon, 2001), Crazy Melon and Chinese
Apple: The Poems of Frances Chung (Wesleyan, 2000), and the acclaimed =
Asian
North American poetry anthology Premonitions and Muae 1 (both published =
in
1995). Formerly a TV news and documentary producer on events in Korea, =
Lew
has also staged his own multimedia performance pieces for the Los =
Angeles
Festival and Walker Art Center. He is currently working on a =
translation
with commentary of the selected works of the Korean avantgarde author =
Yi
Sang (1910-1937), as well as a fictionalized account of the life of the
first Korean American novelist Younghill Kang (1899-1972).

***

POEM


don't be nervous, I'm a poet like
Allen Ginsberg except much shorter

making his way to Oakland to watch
the Celtics and Warriors

I don't have a monkey, either

we thought we saw Allen at a diner
eating brunch the other day

he looked very tired, we didn't
bother him

we should have said, "Allen, don't
you see what's going on? help us!"

but maybe he's done enough and it's

up to poets like us and monkeys
so don't worry



GUARDIANS OF THE SECRET


Go ask them for the antidote for ecstasy, probably
a bargain

the parade route if already immaculate, but
they x'd her sternum every chance they
got

people keep blocking my view, become
people paintings

I'd visit that museum, too, all flesh and
determined looks

action required, to open the phonebook
and get lost in black and white

I, too, will be a painting soon

once decoded I will illuminate for miles
the richness of lusts too powerful to stand



STREET PARKING


late in life and sprawled in an endless
backseat, green reflecting atop green

let's remove tops to play that great
old standard

keenly awash on the mission, needing to
change a 2 dollar bill into a flavor

windows be fogged with whispering

they are chasing the homeless out of Eden
today

and putting the elderly on parade

without you I'm careening but not
dressed for speed

be wet upon the grass and be
the grass wet and whispered to

minus the parking brake, it's a great descent



CITE


what's it like to live in the jaw?
who's asking?  eleven satisfied birds

they were out of Warhols, but will get
more in Friday and next Friday

second-best still rings the twelve bell

what can I say to you now?  their
peals are terrifying and my flight's
forever grounded

a terrific hummingbird just visited

and what if I were sticky across
your legs, or is that too much
to ask?  sorry,

maybe we're not getting anywhere

except noon, left out for orioles
to bite and snatch

Our garbage truck is a Ford with boarded-up sides.
Water in the stream,  still now, milky like a
cataract. Birds pop around us, cute poofs of sophistry
and orgasm. We fell down today walking to our car.

        Until late yesterday, unrelated strands like the snow
walked sullenly and with airless grace through cars
parked along the pile-up, chunks billowing like a
toughened floral cape that fell from the sky burning
up, down homogenized eyes staring back at the word for
eyes staring up. We felt down in a drift of fitted
void, oval with lathering fear in directions of
accumulations nearly perfect in blankness;  a software
of war coming, mingled on nimble businesses that rape
brown skin for black gold, still running at the corner
of our vision down our legs to coil, hugging purple
stars. Birds palpitate cuteness,  hallucinating, as if
powder's endurance could be anything more than our
faces smashed backwards in spoons.

        Take something. Our tongue rolling out to poke an
erection back into cavities; fit  for ovoid snow.

        We watch months of trees shimmying from floral
growth. It had bad teeth, and all its bones were loose
in its skin. Our garbage truck can barely make it over
the ice on the streets. In the background, oily sirens
are proud of dusk, excited by her blood.

What Must Be Done

Reusable East Asian surrealisms, unhappy in their new
environs, yet speaking the language of their times, resolving
issues in a newer, cleaner way, with little or no debris,
recouping trillions of dollars lost when high-tech bubble burst.

Elections, freely and fairly conducted–the sign of true democracy,
guaranteed satisfaction with our personal trainers, with or without binding
arbitration. Several factors militate against fundraising campaigns
not approved by the White House. Cops on the beat, their credibility

damaged during the last bull market, desperately seeking cover,
peaceful solutions totally up to us. Our newest and coolest experiments
in nation-building–just in time for the collapse of nationalism, the rising tide
of transnational fundamentalism. Multicultural subsidies–end them now!

"The event was called "Poems Not Fit for the White House," and the idea
seemed simple enough: a few dozen poets went to Avery Fisher Hall on Monday
night to read poems and express their opposition to an attack on Iraq...This
was an entertaining show, well packaged and paced....
....The night's most memorable moment came from Galway Kinnell, who began
with some remarks on the state of the nation. When he declared, "We are the
resistance," the audience gave him a standing ovation. "But that wasn't my
poem," he protested, half-joking. "I just wanted to read this poem about
giving my son Fergus milk in the middle of the night."

This a curious combination of paragraphs - sounds like the audience went for
one thing and got mostly another(?) (Was anyone on this list there? Were
there any good exceptions?) It sounds as if that most of the invited poets
could not find anything in their own "repertoire" that could speak directly
or indirectly to the issue and need. As if, perhaps, for more than a
generation, duct tape has been covering that part of the poet's pulse and
production when it comes to collective and extra-collective issues.

Yet, at least in terms of the one anti-war poetry reading at Modern Times
(that I have been to) that was not my experience (nor will it be, I suspect)
at this evening's reading at City Lights for the O Books Enough anthology.

But best, no matter where or who, a public door has been opened. I suspect
we're in for all kinds of evolutions.

By the way, if you want a good visual global capital/guerre hit, the artist
Louise Lawler has put together a fantastic series of animations at:

Subject:      For Immediate Release - Faber & Faber inspired by Nthposition's
              100 Poets Against The War, rush out peace anthology

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - FEBRUARY 19, 2003

Faber & Faber - the English world's leading poetry publisher - inspired by
Poets Against The War and www.nthposition.com 's 100 Poets Against The War
book - rush to press with their own volume for peace


In a startling sign of the times, traditionally conservative London-based
Faber & Faber - the famous poetry press which is home of Larkin, Heaney and
Eliot, among others, has rushed out an anti-war anthology of poems, titled
101 Poems Against War.  The collection features poems from antiquity to the
present, and some major poets, and was apparently first conceived three
weeks ago.

Faber declares their book is one of the fastest such publications ever,
though they are just now catching up to the global interest in protest
poetry, first sparked by the Poets Against The War web site, and
www.nthposition.com 's 100 Poets Against The War anthologies, both announced
in late January.

The Poets Against The War web site, first set up to protest Mrs. Bush's
cancellation of a White House Poetry function for fear of anti-war
demonstrations, has to date received almost 9,000 poems.  Nthpositon's
"instant anthology" has been downloaded and printed up world-wide, tens of
thousands of time, in the last 3 weeks, and its editor has received over a
thousand poems.  It has since spawned Franch, German and even Brazilian
versions.

Todd Swift, editor of 100 Poets Against The War - an ebook of poems already
available online since January 27, 2003 in three versions - which has been
the source of widespread media interest from the LA Times to the Guardian
(which called it "remarkable" in early February) - is struck with Faber's
dedication to political protest poetry and its decision to rush its
publication date forward, now that millions have demonstrated over the
week-end.

"I am impressed that Faber - often seen as the home of genteel English
verse - is taking this anti-war stance.  Naturally, I am quite flattered
that they were clearly inspired by Poets Against The War in America and
Nthposition's projects, as well as the projects of Larry Jaffe in LA, and
others in Ireland and across the world.  Faber's marketing decision to rush
the book out like this is intriguing.  It seems publishers want to get on
the peace train before the war starts - and ends.  One hopes no one intends
to profit from anti-war poems, however.  We must keep our eye on the main
goal: to oppose an unjust strike against Iraq, not simply pat ourselves on
the back that we sent some poems out with a nice message.  That being said,
we welcome such a book and have offered to publicise it along with our own.
Faber seems interested in the idea."

Salt Publishing - itself a significant UK/Australian poetry press - was one
of the first to pick up on the impact the thousands of peace poems
criss-crossing the Internet were having - and offered to republish 100 Poets
Against The War in a standard book format, in early March - all profits for
Amnesty International.  This was announced in a press release at the start
of February.

The collection features many of the world's leading contemporary poets and
poetry activists, from Ireland, America, Canada, Australia and the UK,
including: Charles Bernstein, Marilyn Hacker, Bob Holman, Mark Rudman,
Sandra M. Gilbert, George Bowering, George Murray, Mimi Khalvati, Adrian
Mitchell, Sean O'Brien, Robert Adamson and Sinnead Morrissey.  Salt will be
launching the book with readings in Ireland, America, Canada, and England in
March.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

                {I tried to send this a couple of days ago, but goofed.
So I try again}


                What follows has, I think, everything to do with poetry
and poetics, because it has to do with public discourse and freedom of
speech, though I suppose the subject heading might at first glimpse
suiggest otherwise.

                I'm curious: I've not seen any discussion on the List,
and very little elsewhere in USAmerican media, of the suspension of
Habeas Corpus in the U.S. - has there been a news blackout down there,
south of the 49th?

                I'm thinking of the Patriot Act, the Homeland Security
Act, and the proposed Second Patriot Act (on which, see the LA Times for
13 or so February). As things stand right now, it looks as though only
aliens - i.e. people whose skin is the wrong colour, or perhaps their
religious affiliation - can be summarily arrested and thrown into jail
without trial, without charges, and without ANYONE being told what's
happened (your name is not revealed, in order to protect your privacy).
It is disgusting, it is shameful, and it is alarming.. At least one
Canadian citizen was stopped at the border, arrested, and sent to Syria
(from which he was a political refugee) where he was jailed - and it
took the Canadian government quite a few weeks to find out what had
happened to him (he's still in a Syrian jail) - so far as his family was
concerned, he simply disappeared, as did so many in Argentine, Chile,
and sundry other South American states a decade or two ago.

                Aliens are already fair game, can join the ranks of the
disappeared. In was it January of this year President Bush sought the
prerogative to declare ANY citizen an "enemy combatant," subject to an
indefinite jail term without charge or bail or access to a l;awyer or a
court review. Did he get it? Or is that the Second Patriot Act? Does
anyone know?

                And if an immigration officer doesn't like the look of
you, goodbye!

                I may have this wrong, but I think the last suspension
of habeas corpus in the U.S.A. was under Lincoln - after which it was
ruled that it may not be suspended in any area where courts operated.
It's been suspended in Canada too (and in the fairly recent past), by
invoking the War Measures Act - so far it hasn't, this time round, been
invoked.

                If you want to see what happens when Habeas Corpus is
suspended, especially in times of futile and useless War under a berserk
government, read up on life in Britain under Pitt in 1794 [The
Treasonable Practices Bill, 4 November, House of Lords; The Seditious
Meetings Bill, House of Commons, 10 October; the Corresponding Societies
Bill, 19 April 1799; after which the right of  public meeting, of free
speech, and of a free press, ceased to exist] - but even then there were
public trials, even of those "suspected of seditious activity." Check
this out, if you want, in one of the older Britannicas (before it got
dumbed down in the 1960s) - it's an instructive and alarming five-minute
read. And read Blake, and Shelley.

                Say the wrong thing, and you might be in jail, one of
those gentle "houses of correction" so notable in hard-boiled fiction.
What do you think? Am I wrong? Am I simply shouting fire in a crowded
theatre? (We've heard - and on one trip noticed - that if at the border,
driving down to Seattle, you say you're going to a poetry treading, or
to buy books, they search your car. If you say we're on vacation, they
wave you on through. Ah the power of rumour.)

                "Poets Against the War" hardly scratches the surface.

Giving a $350. billion war machine to George W. Bush is like giving a 2 =

I always thought all New Yorker poems were about
gardening, and some flower I've never heard of, and
how that flower is a metaphor for life, or death, or
sex, but only in a very tiny way.

(This is of course not true: there was a Lucia Perillo
poem in there a couple years ago about a funeral that
really rocked my world.)

New Yorker Poem

I never pulled my weeds and now, alas, Viagra doesn't even work.
I never smelled the rose, but now I'm dead, and, boy, do I feel like a jerk.
The garden grew unruly, like my life, and I just thought its waywardness a
quirk.
But now I'm limp and dead, and tossed in the compost with Cheney's smirk.

Possum Sighting in San Francisco

Dale Smith, Hoa Nguyen, and Sotère Torregian reading at New College (777
Valencia Street, btwn 18 and 19th), 8pm, Thursday, February 27.

Hoa Nguyen and Dale Smith, publishers of Skanky Possum Press in Austin,
Texas, visit San Francisco for a reading with Sotere Torregian, whose book I
Must Go (She Said) Because My Pizza’s Cold was just published by Skanky
Possum. They’re great good friends and wonderful poets, and just gosh-all
nice people to meet.

Click here
http://www.durationpress.com/subpress/ancient.htm
for information about Hoa’s new book, Your Ancient See Through

and here
http://www.litvert.com/floodngardenrev.html
for a review of Dale’s latest book, The Flood and the Garden.

and Skanky Possum:
http://www.skankypossum.com/index.html

See below for information about Mr. Torregian, and I hope to see you all
there!

Affiliated with French Surrealist poets and associated with the New York
School of poets and painters, Sotère Torregian has published eight books of
poetry and contributed to many small press magazines, including the Paris
Review and "C," a magazine of the arts. He was acclaimed by Kenneth Rexroth
in 1971 as one of the "best intensely political young anarchist Surrealists
in France." The poems selected here represent a diverse range of work by a
hidden treasure of the American avant-garde.

Not to beat a dead thread, but....

I was all set to write in and share/address Joe's pain:  my own is not so much
produced by the particular things Pratt says as by the symptomatic quality
of this invocation of "Poetry": the "resurgance of poetry" is something that
"happens" again and again, and after a while one has to ask what such an
invocation signifies....

For all its surface reference to the "now" in the form of "def poetry jam",
Pratt's is essentially I think a mythic account:  "Poetry is alive among us,
juices flowing" might be translated as "Poetry has returned to the vital energy
of speech without which it will inevitably wither and die".  And so Pratt finds
it appropriate to use contemporary poetry as an introduction to the topic of
American multilingualism--poetry's vitality comes to signify the diverse
livliness of American speech...

What it DOESN'T signify, in Pratt's letter, is the practice of the original
core constituency of this list.  As the counterpart to the hip vid kids Pratt
refers to "us musty word worshippers":  a nauseatingly faux-self-effacing
gesture which sets up a tidy binary between academics and the "life of poetry".
The President, I want to say, is not speaking for me.  Among the "flourishing
of noncommercial activities" [!] that Pratt lists (many of which are hardly
non-commercial), there's no sign of the 20th century tradition of little mag
publishing--it's as if Pratt didn't know small presses existed...

However:  all the above now needs the following ironic contextualization.
An hour ago an intro to poetry student was in my office, wanting to know if she
could write on a poem other than those I'd suggested.  In the course of our
conversation she identified herself as a beginning writer of performance-
oriented poetry; talked about the importance of "def poetry jam" to her;
expressed suspicion of formalized ways of talking about a poem.  OK.  But when
the question of those other poems came up (disclosure:  text is Vendler, _Poems
Poets Poetry) she went into the back of the book where she'd been reading
around--very extensively, it looked like-- and had marked "Why I Am Not A
Painter," "Blackberrying", and Raleigh's "The Lie".  She especially dug the
last one.

Remarks by the President, Former President Bush, Laura Bush, Former First
Lady Bush and Former Prime Minister of England John Major
The Wortham Theatre Center
Houston, Texas
7:04 P.M. EDT
MRS. BARBARA BUSH: Welcome to this year's Celebration of Reading. I can
hardly believe it, but this is our seventh year. We see so many familiar
faces coming from year to year that we're beginning to think that you even
maybe enjoy the evening, or that you're gluttons for punishment.
(Laughter.) But we are honored and blessed by your support, and thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

Once again, you have managed to outdo yourselves. Incredibly, we will raise
more than $2 million tonight, which -- (applause) -- which means we can
help more people read and build better lives for their families. That's
what tonight is all about. So, thank you for taking the time out of your
busy lives to be with us.
FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH: This is indeed a banner -- a banner year for
Barbara's foundation. But if I may say so, it's been a special year for the
Bush family. (Applause.) As Barbara noted, we have so many friends here,
particularly Texas friends, that we would be remiss if we did not take this
opportunity to thank all of you for your good wishes on the election of the
43rd President of the United States. (Applause.)
You know, it is impossible to describe how 43's election has impacted our
lives. (Laughter.) Fortunately, I don't even have to try to explain it. And
somehow, some of the changes have been captured on video. And we thought we
would give you a glimpse of what life is like for us today.
(A video is shown.) (Applause.)
MRS. BARBARA BUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States
and Mrs. Laura Bush. (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Laura and I
are really glad to be back in Texas. (Laughter.) I didn't realize, Dad,
until I saw that video, how different your life has been since I'm the
President and you're not. (Laughter.) Sounds like it's been pretty rough.
And perhaps you and I should sit down and have a discussion, talk about it.
Let me think: I have an opening the 27th of September. (Laughter.)
We have some other family issues to discuss, like where to put my
presidential library. (Laughter.) I've decided not to go through the hassle
of raising money. And so, you know my dad's library? We're just going to
add, "And Son." (Laughter and applause.) As you can already tell, lately my
dad has been calling me "43." I call him "41." It's kind of shorthand we
have in our family. And we have a nickname for mother as well. To show you
where she stands in the power structure of this family, we call her "Number
One." (Laughter and applause.)
And so I'm going to turn the stage back to Number One, and then close the
program with some remarks of my own. It's really great to be back in
Houston, and to return bearing the proudest title ever been given to me:
son of Barbara and George Bush. (Applause.)
MRS. BARBARA BUSH: Well, I want to thank the President and our fabulous
First Lady for taking the time to be here. It's hard to really judge what
their loyal support to our little event has meant to its success. And,
needless to say, speaking as a literacy advocate and a mother, I think
they're doing a fantastic job in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)
I also want to thank our extraordinary group of authors for joining us
tonight to share their remarkable writing talents. Tonight, we're pleased
to announce the winners of our 11th National Grant Competition, which you
will find listed in your program along with three new grant winners from
Texas.
As many of you know, over the past six years our celebration has been
funding the development of a network of strong family literacy programs
across the state through the new Texas Fund For Family Literacy, and the
First Lady's Family Literacy Initiative For Texas. Nearly $1 million
awarded to 50 family literacy programs in 41 different cities so far.
This initiative is still going strong and is headed by its founder,
America's superb First Lady, Laura Bush. As in past years, we will be
splitting the proceeds from tonight right down the middle: 50 percent for
Texas and 50 percent for the rest of the country. Sounds kind of fair.
(Laughter and applause.)
We're pleased to have the U.S. Secretary of Education here with us tonight,
our superb former Superintendent of the Houston Independent School
District. A strong supporter of family literacy and our very dear friend,
Secretary of Education Rod Paige. (Applause.)
The Secretary has told me that I can announce tonight that he plans to
highlight adult and family literacy in the department, and bring it to new
prominence. And I cannot think of a better note of encouragement to start
our program.
* * * * *
MRS. BARBARA BUSH: As many of you know, we were originally scheduled to
have John Major, the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, and our very
dear friend, at the celebration last year. We were very sad when an
emergency back surgery forced him to change his plans.
However, we had no intention of letting him off the hook. So we're
delighted that he is here with us tonight to read from his wonderfully
engaging autobiography. It's a fabulous book, not only because it provides
fresh insight into historic events, but it is also a great story.
Please join me in welcoming the Right Honorable John Major. (Applause.)
FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN JOHN MAJOR: As Barbara said, I should have
been with you last year, but I was having surgery on my back. It was one of
those rare occasions when a politician had a knife in his back and it did
him good. (Laughter.) But I am, in any event, delighted to be here for
George and Barbara Bush, two of the loveliest people that I know. These
readings are about my life. My father was brought up in Pennsylvania. As a
boy, he joined a fife and drum band and twice paraded in front of President
Grover Cleveland. By the age of eight, he taught himself acrobatics, and
was the top of a four-man pyramid.
As a teenager, he performed on the flying trapeze without a safety net in
order to attract a larger crowd and earn a bigger fee. When I was born, my
father was in his sixties, and my mother was surprised. (Laughter.) I only
remember him as a stern, but kind old man.
My mother was a Peter Pan figure with a gift for attracting lame ducks. I
remember sitting at the table, about to eat my lunch, when a cold and
hungry gypsy knocked at the door. He was invited in, and my mother served
him my meal, leaving me hungry. Afterward, she had the grace not to ask me
to do the washing up. She didn't consider that fair; but being
superstitious, nor did she ask the gypsy to do it.
Books introduced me to a world I had never known and to people I'd never
meet. To me, they were an escape and an education. Some became lifelong
friends. "Fame Is Despair." "A Horseman Riding By." "How Green Was My
Valley." "Trollope," "Phineas Finn," and "Phineas Redux" were never far
from hand. Biographies and histories joined Agatha Christie, Neville
Carters, Thomas Costain and many more. I love Jane Austen and Dickens.
Such books became cherished friends, companions and tutors; the true
furniture of the mind. In my late teens, I read Kafka and Voltaire, Spinosa
on ethics and Aristotle on politics. I dipped into Colette and Hardy. And
all those books remain on my shelves today.
When I was 12, my father's business failed, and he lost all that he owned.
Our family moved from comfortable circumstances to an old victorian house
in Brixton, South London, where we lived in an apartment of two rooms for
the five of us, plus of course Butch, the dog. We shared a cooker on the
landing. There was no bathroom. We washed at the sink or in a tub.
That house was home to a rich collection of characters. On the floor below
us were three Irish boys, one of whom invited my sister to run away with
him. (Laughter.) Another actually proposed to her one morning as she left
for work, but she wasn't really listening; a convenient gift that she
retains to this day. (Laughter.)
Another tenant was a middle-aged cat burglar. He lived with a girl who used
to walk around the house in her underwear. Something of a novelty in the
1950s, but one that added pleasurably to my education. (Laughter.) The cat
burglar occasionally asked me to place his bets on race horses with a book
maker who operated illegally in the tunnel of the local railway station.
Once he offered me half a crown to check if there were any policemen around
before he went out of the house. I agreed to scout with him, but
high-mindedly refused to take the money. It probably wasn't his anyway.
The indignity of our situation affected my parents deeply as they lived
through setback and disaster. They were never crabby or miserable, but
fought adversity in their own way, laughing joyfully at minor triumphs,
outwardly optimistic, and forever hoping for a future that to them would
never come. Too proud, too stiff to acknowledge ill fortune. My father saw
his troubles, his health, his blindness, as temporary setbacks, from which
he would somehow emerge triumphant.
As for my mother, if I found her with wet eyes often enough, I never found
her without hope. If the rain came through the ceiling, well, the water
would be mopped up. If the bills piled up, well, they'd be paid eventually.
If their health worsened, well, it would surely improve. There was always
tomorrow, full of wonderful possibilities. Especially, they thought, for
me. I was to achieve what they had not. I was to put right what was wrong.
My mother, at least, was confident of that.
At the age of 13, I visited the House of Commons for the first time and I
fell in love with it. From that day, my ambition to enter Parliament never
wavered, though it often enough seemed to be an impossible dream.
At 16, I found a job, and I went out into the world as my father retreated
from it. And I can see him now: Thick, over-long grey hair swept back.
Stern features, shirt and Fair Isle sweater under a tweed jacket, stepping
out as fast as he could without hesitation, using his walking stick to
lever himself upright.
He didn't stroll, he marched. Near blind he may have been, but he was
devoid of self-pity. He taught me so much. Not to be deterred by obstacles.
Not to give in to fate. For him, triumph and disaster were passing moments
to be enjoyed or to be endured. When they had gone, he moved on without
regret. All this, he taught me.
A lifetime in politics brought many memorable moments. One day in the
mid-1995s, Boris Yeltsin came to stay at Checkers. Checkers is the British
Prime Minister's Camp David. A beautiful historic house set in hundreds of
acres of beautiful rolling countryside.
We had had some lengthy meetings, and I felt like some fresh air. And I
said to Boris: How do you feel, Boris, about a walk? He agreed. But he went
upstairs to change and he came down a few moments later in an electric blue
track suit and sneakers. (Laughter.) And off we went -- myself, Boris,
Naina Yeltsin, my wife, Norma; 40 or 50 diplomats. (Laughter.) Sixty or
seventy protection officers. The sort of everyday walk for heads of
government.
And we hadn't gone very far -- about 300 yards -- when it became apparent
even to the most casual observer that Boris Yeltsin was not one of the
great walkers of our age. (Laughter.) We walked for a while, and we stood
on the prow of a hill, overlooking some sleepy English villages. And I said
to him, Boris, you have three choices: We can retread our steps all over
the fields and walk back to Checkers. He said, "Baahh." We can climb into
those cars down there, Boris, and be driven back. "Bbbhhh."
Over there, Boris, I said, in the distance, in that village, you can see
the Bernard Arms, Boris. An old-fashioned English pub. (Laughter.) Where we
can get some refreshment. And it was at that moment that for the first
time, Western intelligence learned that President Yeltsin had a few words
of English: "Gins and tonic," he said. "Gins and tonic." (Laughter and
applause.)
And off we set to the pub. The long crocodile followed behind us, and we
arrived at the pub, and it was shut. (Laughter.) Boris Yeltsin's aids were
not at all happy. Their president was not used to being shut out of
anything, let alone an English pub. And there, in the middle of this
beautiful summer day in the English countryside, their aides went 'round,
banging on the door. "Open up," they yelled. "It's the President of
Russia." "Oh, yes," said a voice from inside, "and I'm the Kaiser."
(Laughter.)
Of course, in politics, sometimes you lose, as well as win. On the day
after my election defeat in 1997, the telephone rang. It was George Bush. I
know what losing's like, he said. I've been there. And he went on, warmly
issuing invitations. Come to Kennebunkport, bring the children. The
bluefish are biting. Barbara sends her love.
It was a very cheerful and uplifting call, very George. He was the first to
call me on the day I became Prime Minister, and the first to call me on the
day I ceased to be Prime Minister. The weather was beautiful, as the new
Labor government took up office. And at our home in Cambridge here, Norma
and I considered the future.
On Sunday, we had a buffet lunch for some of our closest friends. It was a
very jolly wake. There was no shifting of eyes, no mumbled sorries from our
guests. There were hugs, and a few tears, and much cheerfulness. We raided
my best wines and my guests sank the lot. (Laughter.) Lunch spread into
supper, as the party rolled on. The whole weekend was a mental windbreak. I
went to bed on Sunday night thinking not of what had been, but of what was
yet to come.
Thank you. (Applause.)
MRS. LAURA BUSH: Before I introduce my husband, I want to congratulate
Barbara Bush once again for such a really fabulous evening. (Applause.) I
also want to thank the writers for inspiring and entertaining us. Your
readings were terrific. And I want to thank everybody else here for coming
tonight and for supporting literacy -- 50 percent for Texas and 50 percent
for the rest of the country. (Laughter and applause.)
You know the old saying that something happening once can be a fluke, two
times makes it a coincidence, three times makes it a habit, but seven
straight years of the Celebration of Reading makes it a wonderful
tradition. I hope this evening's emphasis on literacy inspires more Texans
and Americans of all ages to read.
And, needless to say, I'm very proud of the efforts of the next speaker to
help make sure that every child is educated. If we follow his lead, we'll
certainly become a nation of readers.
Ladies and gentlemen, my husband, the President of the United States,
George Bush. (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you, Laura. One again, thank you all
for that warm welcome. I know all of you join me in thanking the authors
for being here tonight. The readings were fantastic, and we appreciate it.
(Applause.)
You've certainly set a high standard for a little reading I intend to do
tonight. (Laughter.) Now, some people think my mom took up the cause of
literacy -- (laughter) -- out of a sense of guilt over my own upbringing.
(Laughter.) That's one reason why she was so happy I married a teacher.
The truth is, I guess I could have paid a little closer attention when I
was in English class, but it all worked out okay. (Laughter.) I'm gainfully
employed. (Laughter.) And I even have a new book out. And I brought along a
copy. Right here it is. I didn't actually write all of this, but I did
inspire it. (Laughter.) Some guy put together a collection of my wit and
wisdom. (Laughter.) Or, as he calls it, my accidental wit and wisdom.
It's not exactly a world transformed, but I'm kind of proud that my words
are already in book form. (Laughter.) And I thought tonight I would share a
few quotable passages with you. (Laughter.) It's kind of like thoughts of
Chairman Mao. (Laughter.) Only with laughs and not in Chinese. (Laughter.)
Here's one. And I actually said this. (Laughter.) "I know the human being
and fish can coexist peacefully." (Laughter.) Now, that makes you stop and
think. (Laughter.) Anyone can give you a coherent sentence, but something
like this takes you to an entirely new dimension. (Laughter.)
Here's another. "I understand small business growth. I was one."
(Laughter.) My, do I love great literature. I said this up in New
Hampshire. "I appreciate preservation. It's what you've got to do when you
run for President." (Laughter.) "You've got to preserve."
You know, I really don't have the slightest idea what I was talking about
there. (Laughter and applause.) You know, a lot of times on the campaign,
they asked me about economics and I actually said this. "More and more of
our imports come from overseas." (Laughter.) Now, most people would say
this when they're talking about the economy. We ought to make the pie
bigger. (Laughter.) However, I said this. (Laughter.) "We ought to make the
pie higher." (Laughter.) It is a very complicated economic point I was
making then. (Laughter.) But believe me -- believe me, what this country
needs is taller pie. (Laughter and applause.)
And how about this for a foreign policy vision? "When I was coming up, it
was a dangerous world. And we knew exactly who the they were." (Laughter.)
"It was us versus them." (Laughter.) "And it was clear who the them was."
(Laughter.) "Today we're not so sure who the they are" -- (laughter) --
"but we know they're there." (Laughter and applause.)
John Ashcroft, by the way, attributes the way I talk to my religious
fervor. In fact, the first time we met, he thought I was talking in
tongues. (Laughter.) Then there is my famous statement. "Rarely is the
questioned asked, is our children learning?" (Laughter.) Let's analyze that
sentence for a moment. (Laughter.) If you're a stickler, you probably think
the singular verb "is" should have been the plural "are." But if you read
it closely, you'll see that I'm using the intransitive plural subjective
tense. (Laughter.) And so the word "is" are correct. (Laughter and applause.)
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have to admit, in my sentences, I go where
no man has gone before. (Laughter.) But the way I see it is, I am a boon to
the English language. I've coined new words, like "misunderestimate" --
(laughter) -- and "Hispanically." (Laughter.) I've expanded the definition
of words, themselves, using "vulcanize" when I meant "polarize" --
(laughter) -- "Grecians" when I meant "Greeks," "inebriating" when I meant
"exhilarating." (Laughter.) And instead of "barriers and tariffs," I said
"terriers and barrifs." (Laughter.)
We all make our contributions in the world, and I suppose mine will not be
to the literary treasures of the western civilization. (Laughter.) But I do
hope to contribute in my own way. And one of those ways is to bring closer
the day when every child and every American learns to read. And that is why
the budget I submitted to the United States Congress triples the amount of
money available for reading programs all across America. (Applause.)
I'm proud of mother. She took up the cause more than a decade ago. And she
didn't leave it behind in the White House. Through her efforts, and the
efforts of all who have helped the Barbara Bush Foundation, so many lives
have been enriched with new opportunities.
We heard Norma Vargas beautifully describe the good that has come into her
life since she has found the courage to walk into that San Jose classroom
to begin her first lesson. Tens of thousands more have their own stories.
Stories of people finding new and better jobs, and gaining a new sense of
dignity, because now they can read.
And I'm proud that Laura has her own commitment to education. She was a
teacher when I met her. In her own way, she will always be a teacher. She's
the best kind of teacher, too, the kind who leaves no one out, and believes
in the possibilities of every person.
That's the spirit of your cause, and ours. I thank each of you for all you
have contributed. It will be repaid many times over, in lives of new
achievement and lives of new hope. Thank you, and God bless. (Applause.)
MRS. BARBARA BUSH: That ends another Celebration of Reading. Thank you very
much for coming, and a special thank you to our authors. You were terrific,
all of you. And a very special thanks to the President and the First Lady.
I still can't get used to that -- (laughter) -- who have decided to forgo
supper in exchange for more sleep. Maybe he'll do a little better on the
language if he sleeps a little more. (Laughter.) We bid them farewell, and
thank you very much. And God bless you all. (Laughter.)

This link will tell you about an important electronic march to take place
Febr 26th. We are all of us encouraged to participate. Please forward this.

MoveOn, as many of you now know, has been instrumental in the anti-war
movement. It's fair to say that MoveOn's ads and activism have
significantly shored, galvanized, and amplified US and international
anti-war efforts. Please participate in this electronic march on
Washington, Febr 26.

The sexless, godless
communist
machine

that Lorenzo Lamas built

died Wednesday at eleven-oh-four
PM.  What I dislike
most about being alive

is the knowingness in the eyes of
black people

when I glance up from the register
as they enter the store. Even though

I don't follow them at all,
I know they think I think

they're stealing. And that hurts;

unlike death, which is sexy, and
godfearing. "I only wish we'd
had more time, " the black widow

mourns, bearing her scarlet hourglass
in the form of discrete pasties
cupping her nipples. She sure puts on one

helluva show. As for me, I'm just
paranoid. For homeland security,

I keep my eyes on the screen, and my hands
to myself.

Subject:      good times with the President
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

   THE PRESIDENT: There's a joke going round the Internet right now about
my library burning down.  (Laughter.) It says all the books in it were lost
in the fire (laughter) -- and they were both children's books.  (Laughter.)
My good nature and confidence in Jesus Christ as my personal saviour allow
me to laugh at these harmless ribbings. (Laughter and applause.)

The truth is, I don't read books and don't respect them and have no respect
for the people who do.  (Laughter.) They think they're better than other
people.  (Laughter.)  Just because someone works hard to know something
about the world that can't be got on television doesn't make them
better.  (Laughter.) If they're so smart why aren't they president?
(Laughter.)

It's a tough world today and no amount of reading is going to protect you
from it.  (Laughter.)  Look at poetry and what poets in this country think
they can do.  (Laughter.)  Poets don't have much to fear by way of job
loss. (Laughter.) They never got hired to write poems and no one is going
to fire them for writing them wrong. (Laughter.)

But what does a poet know about the real world? (Laughter.)  I think we
could overthrow the Iraqi leader just by dropping anthologies of awful
poetry on Baghdad. (Laughter.)  There's no shortage of 'em, no shortage of
bad poetry here.  (Laughter.)  How's that for "shock and awe," read this
you lousy dictator! (Laughter and applause.)

But that's why they say poetry don't make nothing happen. (Laughter.)  The
trouble with that plan is that it would offend the good tastes of ordinary
Iraqi citizens. (Laughter.) That's why it's better simply to rain missiles
upon them like nobody's business and scare the holy piss out of anyone
armed with anything larger than a pocket knife. (Laughter.) If it don't
kill them first, which it probably will. (Laughter and applause.)

Sure, we're going to end up killing lots of civilians.  (Laughter and
applause.)  We're going to end up killing lots of women and children.
(Laughter.)  But that country has been starving and dying from simple,
curable things and not having simple things like potable drinking water for
more than 12 years now. (Laughter.)  So let's just get this thing out of
the way. (Laughter.)  And that will learn them not to mess with the US!
(Laughter, hoots and loud applause.)

So you look at what a poet says and it just is uncredible. (Laughter.) Like
the liberals they think we just want oil. (Laughter.)  This ain't about
oil, it's about human rights. (Applause.) It's always been about human
rights. (Laughter and applause.) We don't want the Iraqi's oil, we just
want to help them administer it while the country is rebuilt. (Laughter.)
But we don't want the oil for ourselves. ( Laughter.) Maybe we'll just take
a handsome fee for helping them out. ( Laughter and applause.)

The other day Dick Cheney briefed me again on the international situation.
He said they have weapons of mass destruction. He said the leader was a
dictator. He said the people in the country were horribly oppressed. He
said they had a sizable nucular program and they were a positive threat. I
said, let's roll. (Laughter.) Let's get in there right now no matter what
it takes. (Applause.) He said, hold on Mr. President, I'm talking about
North Korea! (Laughter and applause.)

Now there's a country that might do some damage. (Laughter.) They might
give us a real fight! (Laughter.) No, we don't want to fight them.
(Laughter.) Diplomacy is brass knuckles by other means. (Laughter and
applause.)

Now it's no secret that when I campaigned I said the most influential
philosopher on me is Jesus Christ. (Standing applause.) And I believe it's
prayer that helps people, not reading. (Applause.) So I'm going to share
this prayer with you that a young child who suffers from many disadvantages
sent me. (Laughter.) It comes from the great American poet Sam Twain.
(Laughter.) And it's what America needs today to see us through this time
of challenge:

"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our
shells; [Laughter] help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale
forms of their patriot dead; [Laughter]  help us to drown the thunder of
the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, [Laughter and applause ]
writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes [Laughter] with a
hurricane of fire; [Laughter] help us to wring the hearts of their
unoffending widows with unavailing grief; [Laughter]  help us to turn them
out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of
their desolated land [Laughter] in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of
the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit,
[Laughter] worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave
and denied it-for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
hopes,[Laughter]  blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage,
[Laughter] make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain
the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! [Laughter and
applause] We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of
Love, and Who is ever-faithful refuge and friend [Laughter] of all that are
sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts," ...but
especially Americans! Amen. [Laughter and long applause ]

Now what Mr. Twain don't know the Pentagon understands. ( Laughter.) Those
miserable survivors are going to be welcomed into the loving arms of
America. ( Laughter.) That's the spirit of your cause, and ours. (
Laughter.) I thank each of you for all you have contributed. ( Laughter.)
It will be repaid many times over, in lives of new achievement and lives of
new hope.  Thank you, and God bless. (Applause.)

(Crowd applauds, begins chanting... "USA USA USA USA!!....)

Yes, if that is what is meant.  I believe I covered this elsewhere.  The play
between "principles" and "principals" seemed apropos, particularly since
we're celebrating "language" poets who interrogate, among other things, the
notion of authorship.  Sorry if I disturbed the Queen.  Best, Bill

Mirakove Relay #2: On Patriot II

[Note: version on Circulars has live links.  Thanks to Carol for
sending this on!]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY OBTAINS SECRET DRAFT OF PATRIOT ACT II


The nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity has obtained a
draft of a secret document called the Domestic Security Enhancement Act
of 2003. This document is more commonly known as the Patriot Act II,
and is designed to "give the government broad, sweeping new powers to
increase domestic intelligence-gathering, surveillance and law
enforcement prerogatives, and simultaneously decrease judicial review
and public access to information." You can download the document here:

Find an excellent guide to the document by the Bill of Rights Defense
Committee at http://www.bordc.org/Repeal.pdf

View a quick list of consequences to Patriot II here:
http://reclaimdemocracy.org/civil_rights/govpower_enhancement_act.html

GRAVE CONCERN #1: SECRECY AND LIES

Patriot Act II reverses the fundamental principles of a liberal,
democratic society: rather than citizens living private lives and our
government being transparent, we are now to be transparent to
government's impenetrable authority. Charles Lewis says, "democracy is
supposed to be a contact sport, with many and diverse participants, and
we quickly discovered that practically no one on Capitol Hill in either
party or in the national news media had ever even heard of the Domestic
Security Enhancement Act of 2003." So the first concern is, this
document is very mature and was kept from nearly everyone on Capitol
Hill -- never mind the general public.

When the story broke, Barbara Comstock, director of public affairs for
the Justice Dept., said, "Department staff have not presented any final
proposals to either the Attorney General or the White House. It would
be premature to speculate on any future decisions, particularly ideas
or proposals that are still being discussed at staff levels." In fact,
the staff at NOW with Bill Moyers had obtained a control sheet that
proved the document was delivered to VP Dick Cheney and Speaker of the
House Dennis Hastert on January 10. Caught red-handed in lies.


GRAVE CONCERN #2: DIMINISHED CIVIL RIGHTS

Whether you're a liberal, a libertarian, a conservative, an anarchist,
all over free enterprise, an electric-triangle prodigy, or an amoeba
painter, the Patriot Act II is not your friend! The only group that
would be served by this act is one who believes that s/he is best
served by a government that operates behind a thick veil, whose
authority is beyond reproach and not subject to accountability.

The ACLU has posted an outstanding, detailed analysis of the Patriot
II. Here are the basic offenses:
-- diminishes personal privacy by removing checks on government power
-- diminishes public accountability by increasing government secrecy
-- diminishes corporate accountability under the pretext of fighting
terrorism
-- undermines fundamental constitutional rights of Americans under
overbroad definitions of "terrorism" and "terrorist organization" or
under a terrorism pretext; [nb: this topic will be the focus of relay
#3 -- carol]
-- unfairly targets immigrants under the pretext of fighting terrorism
http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&c=206

GRAVE CONCERN #3: NO CHECKS NO BALANCE

"Another section would nullify existing consent decrees against state
law enforcement agencies that prevent the agencies from spying on
individuals and organizations. These consent decrees were crafted
because state and local governments illegally invaded the privacy of
American citizens and repeatedly violated their civil rights. To make
matters worse, the proposed bill prevents courts from issuing
injunctions to block future abuses."
http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0213-09.htm

GRAVE CONCERN #4: CITIZEN ENDGAME

"Perhaps the most troubling section would strip U.S. citizenship from
anyone who gives "material support" to any group that the attorney
general designates as a terrorist organization. Citizenship is the most
basic right for all Americans, one from which other rights -- such as
the right to vote, to participate in politics and even to live in this
country -- all flow. Under our Constitution, Americans can't be
deprived of their citizenship, and the rights that go with it, unless
they voluntarily give it up."
http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0213-09.htm

DEJA VOODOO

If you want to know the future under these new laws, check out the
past. Remember COINTELPRO, the FBI counterintelligence program from
1956-1971? Like the Patriot Act, it claimed to be protecting us from
evil terrorists and agents of foreign powers. In practice, it was a
plan to discredit and neutralize political dissidents at home --
dangerous terrorists like Martin Luther King, the NAACP, and the
National Lawyers Guild. Congress and the courts shut COINTELPRO down
because it was unconstitutional. Bush, Ashcroft & Co are bringing it
back.. on steroids. The report of the Congressional committee that
investigated COINTELPRO is surprisingly readable; see
http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm. It's an
eye-opener.. and it could have been written last week.

THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE "DICTATOR"

John Ashcroft's TIPS program in the original Patriot Act looks an awful
lot like Fidel Castro's Committees for the Defense of the Revolution
(CDR), which the U.S. forcefully condemned. The CDR consists of
neighborhood watch groups, which monitor and patrol blocks and barrios
in order to enforce sedition acts. Many arrests have been made under
their advisement. Behold, The U.S. Cuban Liberty and Democratic
Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996: SEC. 205. REQUIREMENTS AND FACTORS
FOR DETERMINING A TRANSITION GOVERNMENT.
(a) Requirements.--For the purposes of this Act, a transition
government in Cuba is a government that--
(1) has legalized all political activity;
(2) has released all political prisoners and allowed for investigations
of Cuban prisons by appropriate international human rights
organizations;
(3) has dissolved the present Department of State Security in the Cuban
Ministry of the Interior, including the Committees for the Defense of
the Revolution and the Rapid Response Brigades; and
(4) has made public commitments to organizing free and fair elections
for a new government--

Read what the ACLU has to say about the TIPS program:

OUR FREEDOM, OUR RESPONSIBILITY

Heriberto Yepez, a writer, translator, and teacher in Tijuana, reports
that U.S. flag burning has become common in Mexico.
http://thetijuanabibleofpoetics.blogspot.com/ (see entry 15.2.03)
Freedom is a responsibility. We really must reclaim ours. As
international citizens, we have a responsibility to stop the violations
the U.S. is guilty of, to get out of this isolation that the current
administration have thrust us into, and to reinscribe the USAmerican
flag with values that Mexico will embrace, not burn.

If anyone has a minute or two to do a little detective work,  I need a question
answered rather quickly-- via backchannel, if you please.

Langston Hughes has a poem titled "Last Call," which appears on p. 454 of his
collected poems (Knopf, 1994).   The tenth line of this poem is "Lord, that is
your name?"   In context, it seems there might be a typo, that the real line is
"Lord, what is your name?"   But I lack another Hughes text against which to
check this suspicion.

Can anyone help?

If every poet on Earth was as giving and loving a mentor as Joe Torra has
been to me, I would never have to run my mouth at all.  I love him dearly,
and not just because he picks up the check.  He and the list of poets he
mentions have been open and supportive and I count upon as some of my very
best friends.

My SF speech does not damn *all* older poets.  I can't name all the poets
who are supportive and gracious, who make being a younger poet easier and
more fulfilling.  If you feel somehow fingered or implicated by my speech, I

when you say rap is it's own thing, are you saying it has no roots in poetics?  you say it has "poetic elements" but...  but what?

rap's history can be traced to West Africa and later Jamaica, where a fast-paced narrative poem in rhyme was part of the culture's story telling and historical document (in Jamaica these were known as "toasts").  the world of poetry is suddenly ENORMOUS to us (because it is ENORMOUS) because we're finally getting our heads out of our big fat white asses and seeing and hearing what's out there and BEEN out there for thousands of years.

we're pretty damned fortunate to be alive in the TIME when poetry's many splinters are finally coming together and being heard by everyone!  it's LIBERATING!  and beautiful.

Man, I'll be the first in line to agree with overthrowing and rejecting
generations in your way.

But for someone who does not want to hear anyone else's suggestions, you
have a great many of your own.

Do your own thing, Jim. Knock yourself out. If it resonates with people,
they'll buy what your selling.

Keep the focus on yourself.

Nevermind the bullocks.

What follows are the true anti-war exploits of my Uncle Zan, a crazy preacher
who has Alzheimer's.  If any of you saw this horse episode, or by some miracle
captured it on video, let me know.

(As reported by my mother in law)

"Zan went to the Anti-war march in NYC with a group from his church -- a
Methodist church that is pretty activist-- but after they arrived, he got
separated from the group. However, he listened to the speeches, and enjoyed
that -- Desmond Tutu, MLK III etc.,  then after that, he went to a coffeeshop
with about 50 other people and had a nice cappucino; when he came out onto the
street again, he saw a police officer on a horse chasing a woman.  Zan was just
sure that the horse was going to trample the woman, so he stepped out into the
street and grabbed the horse's reins as it galloped by bringing the horse to a
sudden stop! The officer tried to get rid of Zan by whacking him with his stick
but Zan just kept pulling the horse's head around, so that the officer was
striking the horse instead of Zan. The horse got spooked, reared up and threw
the officer off onto the ground, and ran off. Four more police arrived and they
all jumped on top of Zan, who was mad as a hornet all the while, and was
fighting them off with all the strength he could muster; they cuffed him and put
him in a paddy wagon.  Oh -- the photo of all of them on top of him is
supposedly in the paper; he is not named in the picture, but apperantly all you
can see is the top of his head.  So then they took him off to a holding cell
where he spent about 6 hours with a bunch of other protesters who had been
arrested anyway, he was charged with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest
but he has lost the paper that told where and when the hearing is."

Please join me in a round of applause for Uncle Zan.

As I mentioned earlier, I've given up on this issue.
It seems expressing an opinion can lead to headaches.
What I am saying is, I hope that traditional, written
forms of poetry will not disappear in favor of
performance poetry, rap, etc. Because I think it has a
virtue separate from the virtue of rap. I am saying
NOTHING dispariging about rap, but only stating my
hope for the future of written poetry, whose content
appeals most to me. Just an opnion, I still feel
liberated by the written word and its beauty, aside
from the slams, jams, and everything else--Call me old
fashioned. I was not saying that rap's roots are not
in poetry, I think focusing on a small semantic issue
misses my point. But really, I get exhausted just
thinking about this thread.

Flora,

I don't think anyone is questioning your taste. That is personal thing.
But, written language comes along rather late in the game. We've been on
the planet as Homo-Sapiens for 35-50 000 years but writing for only 5000.
Might I suggest reading the first section of Walter Ong's _Orality and
Literacy_.

You can even read about this tradition in Blake.

I once wrote:

Early on in his career Blake was conscious of the limitations of fixing
verse into a book. His method of illuminated printing was less stable than
commercial letter press printing and this de?stabilization forces the
reader to consider the book's production.  The form itself is a subtle
analysis of print and points out how the book works to mute any dialogue
between the reader and the author.  Blake produced his own alternative to
the technologizing of poetry.  By combining words and visual images on the
same page we can more clearly regard the printed word as a visual image.
The "Introduction" to The Songs of Innocence traces a movement from
piping, through singing into writing ?? three modes of human utterance.
By the end of the poem the poet is alone and the child has "vanish'd from
my sight"(15). This is a lament for a loss of community as writing is a
solitary pursuit.  The "book that all may read"(14) is the only method of
transmission of the Songs and can only exist when there is a reader there
to liberate or participate in the poem.  The poet's work is done so he
isn't needed anymore.  The book that remains has lost the Bard's
spontaneity, tone, cadence, and gesture - all of the important facets of
reciprocal discourse. Blake was beginning to show an understanding of  how
the mode of production was linked to consciousness and continued to
develop his ideas through allegory in his subsequent poetical works.

just my two cents.

kevin

Conrad's post brought up my memory of the summer of 1966 recording "oral
literature" one summer with a Nigerian colleague in his home province of
Ogoja. Along with much great traditional song & story making, we spent one
whole night's in his father's compound listening and recording contemporary
stuff by young men in what resembled a jam session, or as I later wrote in
an 1981 essay, "perhaps most similar to American blacks vying back and forth
in the telling of 'toasts'. The language was a hybrid of Pidgin English,
formal English parody, dabblings of Italian, and Ojoja dialects. In Richmond
(in the Bay Area where I had grown up), I was very familiar with the form -
having worked with African-Americans, many with long experience in southern
prisons  - who could go on at great length improvising on "The Signifying
Monkey", "Stag-a-Lee", one great one about Jack Johnson, the boxer who went
down on the Titantic, swimming under the Atlantic and arriving on the
streets of New York City.
In Ogoja I sensed I was clearly at one of the original roots of the form. &
I loved it. Maybe two lines from from Linue Ede Igbagiri sums up one of
arguments in this MLA thread (mandarin vs. 'servant' claims to culture?):

       Gentility without ability
       calls me a drunkard


Unfortunately the tapes - but not one of our 'translations' went up in the
smoke of the Biafran War.

The essay is called, "Collecting in Ogoja" and it's in THE POETRY READING: A
Contemporary Compendium on Language & Performance, edited by Stephen Vincent
& Ellen Zweig (Momo's Press, 1981) - a few copies still available at SPD or
the library.

Yes, written language came after oral language, but it
doesn't change my preference. And I think poetry
thrives on musicality and sound. It would take too
long to qualify statements with a brief history of
history, so I assumed the gaps, I guess I should have
qualified my controversial statement to avoid offense.
Thank you for your insight--I love Blake.

War On Iraq? (leaflet for teach-ins, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Following is another document that Jonathan forwarded to me which was
put together -- in a curt, bullet-pointed fashion -- to help with
teach-ins.  Here is a <a
href="http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/war_on_iraq.pdf">.pdf
version of the document</a>, formatted to be printed on a single
two-sided sheet and good for handing out.]

Over the past year and a half the Bush administration has put forth a
variety of arguments for prosecuting a war on Iraq to unseat Saddam
Hussein. Keeping up with these arguments can be confusing—partly
because they keep changing. At the same time, both here and abroad,
challenges to the administration's reasoning continue to mount. What
follows is an attempt to break down the major areas of debate.

FOR WAR

<b>* Iraq is a threat to the United States and the world.</b>

The Bush administration argues that Iraq under Saddam Hussein is a
rogue state capable of developing and deploying weapons of mass
destruction (WMD); if left unchecked, this capability would make Saddam
a menace to the peace in the Middle East, if not the world at large. An
even greater danger is that he could supply terrorist networks such as
Al-Qaeda with WMD. Once WMD are in the hands of terrorists, argues
President Bush, they "could not easily be contained."  Likening this
moment to Munich in 1938, administration officials have argued that
Saddam Hussein must be stopped before this threat is realized, just as
the Allies should have stopped Hitler.

<b>* Iraq suffers under a brutal dictatorship.</b>

Hussein's government has inflicted countless atrocities on its own
people and numbers among the world's worst abusers of human rights. He
employs torture and surveillance to keep the Iraqi people in a
continual state of fear, while diverting Iraq's resources toward the
enrichment and consolidation of his regime. He must be removed on
humanitarian grounds alone.

<b>* Regime change in Iraq will benefit the Middle East.</b>

Democracy in Iraq would lead to growing liberalization of govern-ments
all over the region by offering an alternative template to Islamic
fundamentalism and authoritarian rule. The benefits of this process
could also include an eventual resolution to the Israel-Palestine
conflict.

<b>* The credibility of international rule must be maintained.</b>

Iraq has flouted several United Nations resolutions and must be held to
account. If not, the UN will lose all credibility in its attempt to
preserve an interna-tional rule of law that applies equally to all its
members.

<b>* Advances in communications and warfare technology, together with
the time the U.S. has had to prepare for this war, will result in a
quick and decisive conflict with minimal U.S. and civilian
casualties.</b>

Military technology since the first Gulf War has improved
signif-icantly, with a tenfold increase in the use of "smart"
satellite-guided bombs, and the introduction of unmanned reconnaissance
vehi-cles, high-powered microwave weapons and a thoroughly digi-tized
communications network.

AGAINST WAR

<b>* The military threat from Iraq remains unproven, while North Korea,
among other nations, openly flouts international agreements.</b>

Credible analysts, including former chief UN weapons inspector Scott
Ritter, argue that Iraq has been largely disarmed and that it is now
effectively restrained through the UN inspections process. Hussein
knows that a deployment of WMD traced to his regime would bring swift
and decisive response.  Connections between Hussein and Al Qaeda remain
speculative at best.  Meanwhile, the presence of WMD in the hands of
other unstable or totalitarian regimes around the globe—in North Korea
(with a missile capable of reaching the United States), Pakistan, and
China, not to mention the neighboring Middle East states of Syria,
Egypt, and Israel—argues for a general plan of disarmament to rid the
world of these deadly weapons, of which the United States is now the
leading manufacturer and supplier.

<b>* "Nation building," in Iraq as well as elsewhere, is a long and
arduous task, for which the United States has shown neither capability
nor commitment.</b>

Since the post-WWII recon-structions in Europe, the U.S. has largely
restricted its leadership in the world to military matters, leaving the
real work (and costs) of humanitarian aid, peace-keeping, and "cleaning
up" to the international community. If the U.S. acts unilaterally, this
time, it will have to face the consequences alone. The still-precarious
situa-tion in Afghanistan, together with the equally uncertain state of
the U.S. economy, offer little support to the confident assertions in
Washington that we can manage a post-war crisis in Iraq.  Iraq's
political terrain, rooted in its colonial history, is complex:
Hussein's despotic regime masks a feudal power structure, itself
undermined by diverse revolution-ary movements, including substantial
numbers of Kurds, as well as Shiite Muslims and a Sunni minority,
opposed to one another and divided among themselves.  Such difficulties
argue against any smooth transition to democratic gover-nance.
Furthermore, the past history of U.S. support for Hussein's regime at
its bloodiest, during the 1980s—which entailed active collaboration in
his war against Iran, even in the face of evidence that he used
chemical weapons against his own people—does not, in many Arabs' eyes,
qualify the U.S. for its professed role as "liberator."

<b>* Justice in the Israel-Palestine conflict is a better route to
peace in the Middle East than imperial invasion.</b>

A U.S. invasion of a sovereign Middle East nation is likely to further
inflame Arab feeling against the United States and against its client
state Israel (a state also equipped with undeclared WMD). Neighboring
countries would suspect, justifiably, that a puppet regime in Iraq is
simply a means of extending U.S. control over an oil-rich region. The
chances that an invasion would further undermine security both in the
Middle East and abroad are too great to justify war. Instead, they
point to the overwhelming need for a just and peaceful solution to the
conflict in Palestine—where a less than fully democratic Israel
continues to occupy Palestinian territories and subject their
inhabitants to oppressive control, in tandem with a less than fully
democratic Palestinian Authority that cynically ignores the demands of
its constituents for reform. Aggressively promoting democratic
solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would do much to ease
tensions in the Middle East generally, as well as take away one of the
few propaganda points in Hussein's attempt to ally himself with his
Arab neighbors.

<b>* The credibility of UN rule is best maintained through the
compliance of its most powerful member. </b>

The U.S. needs to abide by the rulings of the UN in its determi-nations
over the best way to deal with a noncompliant Iraq. A "preemptive"
invasion of Iraq, without a second UN resolution authorizing force, is
illegal and contravenes the very basis of the charter of the United
Nations, the principle of nation-state sover-eignty. The UN inspections
process has produced results, and may be expected to produce more in
the future. A U.S. rush to war can only further shred the fabric of
international agreements, already weakened by the current
administration's cavalier dismissal of those it finds uncongenial.

<b>* Make no mistake: civilians are always the first victims of modern
warfare.</b>

Even in Afghanistan, where the U.S. went to some lengths to minimize
so-called collateral damage (and which has been touted as a success),
as many as 8,000 civilians were killed by U.S. bombs and many more
maimed.  In Iraq the U.S. has demonstrated its willingness to exact the
"price" of significant civilian casualties— in the past, through
bombing of water and sewage treatment infrastructure which, in
com-bination with long-term sanctions limiting access to basic
medicines and chemicals like chlorine, has led to the deaths of as many
as 500, 000 children. Faced with invasion, Hussein will be far more
likely to use whatever chemical and biological stockpiles he does
harbor, whether on his own people or on U.S. troops. Finally, for all
its reliance on high-technology and high-precision weaponry, the
number-one priority of current U.S. military strategy— minimizing the
deaths of U.S. soldiers through massively concentrated bombing from the
air— can only translate into a corresponding increase of civilian
deaths on the ground. We are told repeatedly that the Iraqi people are
not our enemy. But Pentagon blueprints suggest otherwise.

Here is something from a little feature that I follow on commondreams.org
called "Ari & I"

Ari & I
White House Press Briefing with Ari Fleischer
  Wednesday, February 19, 2003 - 12:15pm
  by Russell Mokhiber

  Mokhiber: You said last week that, "Every step will be taken to protect
civilian and innocent life in Iraq." But Pentagon officials have said that
under a battle plan called 'shock and awe,' "there will not be a safe
place in Baghdad when we attack." Baghdad is a city the size of Paris,
with five million residents. If there will not be a safe place in Baghdad
when we attack, then how do you plan to protect every civilian life?

Ari Fleischer: First of all, I think that any construing of any statements
that are made by anybody at the Pentagon to suggest that the Pentagon does
not and will not take every step to protect innocent lives is an unfair
representation of what the Pentagon would say. It's well-known how the
United States conducts itself in military affairs. We are very proud of
the fact that any time force is reluctantly used, the force is applied to
military targets and innocents are protected.

Mokhiber: Second question. You have admitted that Saddam may attack our
invading troops with chemical and biological weapons. On Sunday, 60
Minutes reported that many military leaders believe that our troops have
neither the proper equipment, nor the proper training to survive a
chemical and biological attack. The report quoted an Army audit that found
that 62 percent of the gas masks examined "had critical defects that could
cause leakage."

Now, since 100,000 U.S. veterans in the Gulf War may still be suffering
from Gulf War [illnesses] -- many of them believe that this is from
inhaling toxic fumes. Tens of thousands of them were exposed to sarin gas
when we bombed a Iraqi munitions dump. How can the President send troops
into harm's way knowing that they are not adequately protected from a
chemical and biological attack?

Ari Fleischer: The President has full faith and confidence in the
Department of Defense and in their planning for the worst. And I think
premised in your question is the fact that perhaps you now are coming
around to the realization that Iraq does indeed have weapons of mass
destruction and a willingness to use them. It's not anybody in the United
States government who has admitted -- in your word -- that Iraq might use
these weapons -- it's that Iraq has such weapons, they've used them in the
past. And hence the danger not only to the troops who are in the region,
but to people abroad, people in the United States, and friends and allies
and civilians in the region who remain vulnerable to Saddam using such
weapons on innocents.

Mokhiber: What about the 60 Minutes report that we're not prepared --

Ari Fleischer: As I indicated to you, the President has full faith and
confidence in DOD's measures to protect our troops in all circumstances.

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 21 [10:30pm]
POETS ON THE PEAKS
An event with John Suiter, author/photographer of Poets on the Peaks: Gary
Snyder, Philip Whalen & Jack Kerouac in the North Cascades. John Suiter is =
a
Boston-based freelance photographer and writer whose work has appeared in
numerous national and international magazines over the last ten years. He
lives and works in Boston, where he is an instructor at the New England
School of Photography. Poets on the Peaks is both a literary group portrait
of Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen centered around their
experiences as fire lookouts in the early 1950s, and a photographic homage
to the North Cascades landscape. The book features 54 photographs =8B mostly
B&W, Duotone photographs of the peaks =8B taken by John Suiter, and also
several historical photos, some of which have never before been published.
Based on scores of previously unpublished letters, journals, and recent
interviews with Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and others, Poets on the Peaks
is about the development of a community of poets, including the famous Six
Gallery reading of October 1955. It contains cameos by fellow poets and
mountain-climbers Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth, Philip Lamantia and
Michael McClure. It is also a book about Dharma and the years of Dharma
Bums, from the 1951 roadside revelation in the Nevada desert that led Gary
Snyder to drop out of academia and head for Japan, to Kerouac's
lonely vigil with The Diamond Sutra on Desolation Peak, to Philip Whalen's
ordination as a Zen priest. Finally, Poets on the Peaks is the story of the
birth of a wilderness ethic. Transcending many of the tired clich=E9s of the
Beat life, it tells how the solitary mountain adventures of three young
writers helped to form the literary, spiritual, and environmental values of
a generation. Anthony Brandt of National Geographic Adventure notes: "A
fresh, engaging chronicle of a gateway period in American cultural life, th=
e
rise of the Beats. . . . The book works best not as a chronicle, although i=
t
does that well, nor as a set of mini-biographies but as a reminder that the
twin of the active life is the contemplative one." Read Michael Rothenberg'=
s
wonderful interview with John Suiter (and take a look at some of John's
photographs) in Big Bridge: http://www.bigbridge.org/fictsuiter.htm

MONDAY FEBRUARY 24 [8:00pm]
ERICA KAUFMAN AND DAN MACHLIN

New York for quite some time. She assists Rachel Levitsky with the
Belladonna* reading series which is currently held monthly at Zinc Bar. Her
recent poems can be found on canwehaveourballback.com.

Dan Machlin is the author of two chapbooks of poetry, This Side Facing You
(Heart Hammer) and In Rem (@ Press), and a recent Audio CD collaboration
with Serena Jost, Above Islands (Immanent Audio). His poems have appeared i=
n
Crayon, Pom2, A Portable Boog Reader, Talisman, Fell Swoop and online at Th=
e
Poetry Project and the EPC at Buffalo. He is a founder and editor of
Futurepoem books and March 2003 curator at The Bowery Poetry Club/Segue
Saturday series.

WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 26 [8:00pm]
SHERMAN ALEXIE AND CHUCK WACHTEL
Sherman Alexie recently made a stunning debut as a director when he brought
his title, The Business of Fancydancing, out as a debut independent film.
The movie has been voted Best Narrative Feature Film (Durango Film Festival=
)
and received an Outstanding Screenwriting Award (OUTFEST). The Seattle
Weekly raves: "Every filmmaker should have such talent." Sherman Alexie has
published 14 books to date, including his most recent collection of short
stories, The Toughest Indian in the World, and his newly released poetry
collection, One Stick Song. His several books of poetry include Old Shirts =
&
New Skins (UCLA) and The Summer of Black Widows (Hanging Loose Press).
Shortly after the publication of his first book, The Business of
Fancydancing - a collection of poetry and stories - Alexie was described as
"one of the major lyric voices of our time" in the New York Times Book
Review. He was named one of Granta's Best of Young American Novelists and
won the Before Columbus Foundation's American Book Award and the Murray
Morgan Prize for his first novel, Reservation Blues, published in 1995 by
Atlantic Monthly Press. His second novel, Indian Killer, published in 1996,
also by Atlantic Monthly Press, was named one of People's Best of Pages and
a New York Times Notable Book. A story from his first collection of short
stories, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, was released as the
movie Smoke Signals at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1998; the movi=
e
won two awards: the Audience Award and the Filmmakers Trophy. Alexie
occasionally does readings and stand-up performances with musician Jim Boyd=

Jim Behrle

first of all, it was nice to meet you at the SF protest last weekend with
mr. cross...

i've been thinking about your speech (and sorry again that i missed it at
the event) and turning over a few thoughts on it ever since... as you've
already acknowledged, not every older poet ought to be "damned."

i'd like to chime in to testify that i too could never have made it this far
without the support and nourishment of older poets. and that my experience
with the doubters, the naysayers, the holder-backers, is that they come at
least as much if not more from the ranks of the poets closer to my own age
or just a little bit older, who seem to believe they have something to
protect, and are afraid of associating with the forming or yet-unformed
among us, as i was when i first arrived here in SF... (and in many ways
still am)

i think it's more than important to make that distinction. i don't think we
do enough listening to our elders, to come to a place where we give them the
big "fuck you" and move on with total confidence in our own forms. yes, on
some level the "fuck you" is eventually necessary, even to those who've
nourished and supported you (though there is of course a much nicer way to
say it) it is absolutely necessary to grow to stand on one's own legs
without teacher propping one up.

but i would thank even those who've stood in opposition or discouraged for
that opposition has shaped me every bit as much...

a true teacher (read "older poet") is one who has burned everything up in
the fight, and is nothing but joyful to see the student beginning to take
shape in the realm of poetry, so that the arc of the learning can go on...
at least that's how it seems to me.

when i was at naropa last summer there was a large contingent of very young
students going around muttering about anne waldman (one of them even wrote a
poem that started

"O anne, anne, anne with an 'e'" !!!!)

--- bitching that she wasn't doing enough to make herself available to
younger students, that she only stayed for half of the student reading, etc.
not one of them had bothered to try to talk to her, however, they had done
the characteristically youthful, petulant thing of feeling rejected and
snapping back to that "fuck you" without bothering to get the real goods. so
i guess that's the caveat i have with this whole "forgetting yr heroes"
thing, jim... i have this image of you leading us all out of the cellar of
poetry mansion with yr red sox cap on and a baseball bat in yr hand, but i
hope it doesn't dissuade any of the younger folks from stopping to sit at
the feet of their elders for a little while and digging what they have to
tell them...

best,

DH

New to list.  What speech about older poets?  Is it available?

Most remarkable "fuck you" was Dorn's "From Glouster Out."  Now there's
a young poet paying due homage yet saying he must stand on his own,
elsewhere than when Olson stands.

I don't know if it's the most remarkable of its kind, but it ranks.
(And it sure tops Lowell's 14-liners on his elders: Frost, Pound, etc.)

Hiya,

i'm looking for a page citation for the oft-quoted but as far as i have so
far found never cited in detail Lautreamont image:

'He is handsome . . . as the fortuitous encounter on a dissecting table of a
sewing machine and an umbrella'

I've got a 1970 edition of the Alexis Lykiard translation (Alison and Busby)
and would at least hope that somebody hereabouts has an idea which of the
six 'songs' it comes from if not an actual page number given that editions
will differ. I'm wanting to read what leads up to and follows on from this
ubiquitous quote.

I've scanned through it several times today and still not spotted it.
Various book trawls and web searches have thrown up numerous references but
no actual reference.

any help appreciated. Back channel i guess to save the list.

love and love
cris

It will sound ungrateful to say this but I personally I have not found
older poets to be of much use at all, and as far as I can tell the feeling
is mutual. I could name exceptions, of course, but none of them are people
I think of as "older," in that they haven't lost their appetite for
novelty. Or if they have, they're putting on a brave show. --By the same
token, I'm not that alarmed to hear that older poets don't "get" younger
poets, can't figure out their politics, etc. Nor will I be surprised to
find today's young Turks stymied by the following generations. Wasn't Ed
Dorn's early work groundbreaking, and didn't he become a complete dick. Who
will be the host of Curmudgeon's Corner 2030? Bet it's the last person
you'd expect LRSN

Howdy, I'm jumping into this thread quite late, haven't been reading it for
lack of time, but I'd say I've had a different experience from David's (or
maybe David's just counting the best of the older poets as "younger"?).  I've
talked before on this list (probably years ago now) about how generous Bob
Perelman was to me and Louis Cabri, Kristen Gallagher, Mytili Jagannathan, Matt
Hart and many others when I lived in Philadelphia -- and by generous I DO NOT
mean he hooked us up with prizes and publishers, there was none of that, but
rather he treated us like equals, was enthusiastic as hell, starting reading
groups which were VERY anti-hierarchical but nonetheless intense, assertive,
informative.  Just very encouraging and challenging too.  I can think of many
others who've been similarly encouraging and open to what I was doing
poetically even if it wasn't necessarily their exact thing (Bill Berkson and
Susan Howe come immmediately to mind.)  I was one of the lil upstarts who
criticized Ron's and Lyn's statements in the Forum section of the latest Poetry
Project Newsletter (is that how this thread got started?) but that sort of
harangue has been the exception in my experience rather than the rule.   -m.

now i know some of you know how to use a microphone, and i know some of you
know how to plug it into your computer (although passing it through an
enhancer [amplifier]doesn't hurt; a small 4 track mixing desk i use)

what i would like is to hear your voices on my audioblog, reading poems,
saying hello in the language of your choice, ranting or raving on the topic
of your choice, telling jokes if you feel like it.

so i have prepared a little tutorial using techsmith's camtasia studio to
capture my screen and output it as a flash movie.
the tutorial runs you through using audioblog by jeremy allaire and
accessible through http://bilbo.macromedia.com/audioblog

the tutorial is at

http://live-wirez.gu.edu.au/cyber/komninos/testvoice.html

what is basically involved is recording your piece, it is stored as a
streaming mp3 file on the macromedia server, audioblog gives you the code
for accessing it, you send the code to me and i enter it in my blog.
unfortunately you can't post code as comment or you could do the whole
process your selves.

so i expect to be getting your voices as code in emails very soon.
love to hear your voices.
i'd just love it.

wouldn't all of you like to hear what everybody else sounds like?

a brief note to say how much I am enjoying Sawako Nakayasu's
_Hockey Love Letters_ (Tinfish 2002).  Sawako's attack on
something "visually elaborate but always wordless" is great fun--
most especially "Ice Event:  For 14 Performers and 1 Audience
Member"--but also goes after the oddly mathematical side of the game
--that analytically compelling aspect of its physicality

& the chapbook as object itself, lovely

If someone disagrees with you, does it mean you're causing offense?
Aren't you just causing a conversation?
I'm not offended, Flora, but I do disagree with you.

Bookseller purges files to avoid potential 'Patriot Act' searches

Thursday, February 20, 2003 Posted: 7:32 PM EST (0032 GMT)

MONTPELIER, Vermont (AP) -- Some booksellers are troubled by a
post-September 11 federal law that gives the government broad powers to
seize the records of bookstores and libraries to find out what people
have been reading.

Bear Pond Books in Montpelier will purge purchase records for customers
if they ask, and it has already dumped the names of books bought by its
readers' club.

"When the CIA comes and asks what you've read because they're
suspicious of you, we can't tell them because we don't have it," store
co-owner Michael Katzenberg said. "That's just a basic right, to be
able to read what you want without fear that somebody is looking over
your shoulder to see what you're reading."

The Patriot Act approved after the 2001 terrorist attacks allows
government agents to seek court orders to seize records "for an
investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine
intelligence activities."

Such court orders cannot be challenged like a traditional subpoena. In
fact, bookstores and libraries are barred from telling anyone if they
get one.

U.S. Attorney Peter Hall played down concern that government agents
might soon be darkening the door at Vermont bookstores and libraries.

"Only in very rare and limited and supervised circumstances would
anyone be seeking that sort of business information from a bookseller,
a library or a business of any sort," Hall said.

He also said businesses can do whatever they want with purchase records
as long as the material isn't being sought under a court order.

Such record requests from bookstores were becoming more frequent even
before the attacks.

Kramer's Books in Washington won a court order blocking independent
counsel Kenneth Starr from getting records of purchases by Monica
Lewinsky during his investigation of the sex scandal involving
President Clinton. And the Colorado Supreme Court ruled last year for a
Denver book store in its fight against a subpoena of purchase records
by a defendant in a drug case.

The court found that "compelled disclosure of book-buying records
threatens to destroy the anonymity upon which many customers depend."

Chris Finan, president of the American Booksellers' Foundation for
Freedom of Expression, said booksellers until now have frequently kept
lists of books their customers read as a matter of marketing. Some
offer discounts to frequent customers or send a notice when a favorite
author has a new release.

Finan said he wasn't aware of any widespread move by booksellers to
purge such lists.

Peggy Bresee was in Bear Pond Books recently to buy "War is a Force
That Gives Us Meaning" and "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy" as
birthday gifts for a son who lives in Utah. She had the store purge the
purchase records.

"It really does make me feel so much better," she said. "They're
protecting those of us who are readers. It matters."

madness of organs


the madness of organs. the organist takes care of things. the organist
watches the keyboard. she watches her hands on the keyboard. she takes
care of higher keys and lower keys. her hands move apart and return in
fugue. the organist is in fugue state. he commands the air we breathe. he
siphons the air. the air is siphoned by the organist. his passion is
controlled by the process of pressing a key. the key is pressed and held.
holding the key down, the organist controls a column of air. he commands
the reeds of metal and bodies of wood. she is obsessed over a beautiful
boy. her hair streams in the wind. she plays the organ naked. her breasts
thrust forward with the stroke of keys. the boy is wounded in flanders
field. the boy is dying. he is obsessed with her. he thinks he is ugly and
disfigured. he plays madly. he is in a state of fugue.

i am that organist in a state of fugue. i am surrounded by beautiful girls
and boys. i am utterly mad in my columns of air. i command the atmosphere.
i command the world of metal and wood. the organ towers above me. the
organ is a great loudness in the world. the organ broadcasts my obsession
and passion. the organ is a great tower unto mankind.

my long hair falls on the keys. my thick blond hair falls on the keys. my
thick black hair falls on the keys. the beautiful boy will come and hear
my playing and take me in his arms.

***my apologies if you receive this multiple times***

yes, the time is upon us once again, the time when the sense that the =
world is full of people seated atop thirty foot poles with their ears =
finely tuned for the sound of one hand as it claps in the wind dusts off =
its shoulders and rudely makes its own way in from the cold like some =
sort of belligerent person.  why be cold?  we might want to ask for our =
own very special reasons.  in the matter of a fight the law will always =
seek out the victor as the transgressor.  so why not make a night of it?

imagine:

Nikki Reimer-- air in the matter of a secret, lacunae that frustrate =
familial albums, and that not only on full moon nights, Nikki Reimer =
should be listed as a powerful natural force of kindness in whatever =
almanac you regularly turn to when in need, and she will mesmerize, oh =
yes, yes she will.

Francais Kruk-- the recipe should include several wolves, a scarf, some =
chocolate, an invocation of Edgar Cayce (any will do, though in a pinch =
I'd reccommend the one made by our friends at the goodly Nabisco company =
for added pluck), something borrowed, and something blue so as to =
produce the most excellent conditions for our spirits to be wizened by =
Francais Kruk's totalimmersiontheatre.

Nicole Markotic--  there are two figures with catapaults way up on Nose =
Hill, and somewhere, unbidden, a costume shop opens with a voice that =
says quietly behind your left ear:  "never mind that, it is damn cold =
out here, so go to the hop n brew to hear Nicole Markotic read!"

little portraits of frail anomalies, presidents whose canoes bleed in =

Greedy inertia winks its timeless blossom for abandon flows turbulent =
with a flavor of meander

broken dolls chattering like national stripes in the universal wind
break red corn bread this heart clock is cake
beaks line the tournament and all the world is a symphony of arms
reaching to the root which stark raving sad

one liquid drop

For several days, I've felt an exuberant, political hunger
to desire, to kiss tenderness on both cheeks,
and from far away I've felt a demonstrative
desire, another desire to love, willingly or by force,
whoever hates me, the one who tears up his paper, the little boy,
the woman who weeps for the man who was weeping,
the king of wine, the slave of water,
whoever hid in his wrath,
whoever sweats, whoever passes, whoever shakes his person in
        my soul.
And I desire therefore to arrange
the braid of whoever talks to me; the soldier's hair;
the light of the great; the greatness of the kid.
I desire to iron directly
a handkerchief for whoever is unable to cry
and, when I'm dejected or happiness aches me,
to mend the child and the geniuses.

I desire to help the good person to become a little bad
and I have an urge to be seated
to the right of the left-handed, and to respond to the mute,
trying to be useful to him
as I can, and likewise I so much desire
to wash the cripple's foot,
and to help my one-eyed neighbor to sleep.

Ah to desire, this one, my own, this one, the world's,
parochial and interhuman, mature!
The feeling comes, perfectly timed,
from the foundation, from the public groin,
and, coming from far away, makes me hunger to kiss the
        singer's muffler,
whoever is suffering, to kiss him on his frying pan,
the deafman, fearlessly, on his cranial murmur;
whoever gives me what I forgot in my breast,
on his Dante, on his Chaplin, on his shoulders.
I desire, in order to terminate,
when I'm at the celebrated edge of violence
or my heart full of chest, I would desire
to help whoever smiles laugh,
to put a tiny bird right on the evildoer's nape,
to take care of the sick annoying them,
to buy from the vendor,
to help the killer kill--a terrible thing--
and I would desire to be good for myself
in all

Thank you to you and Kasey... that was the piece I thought
the allusions were to...

Yes, The New Yorker: and perhaps I was wrong-headed --
or at least too hard on the mag: I was quickly reproached by
a friend of mine who works at the Conde Naste pub., who
informed me that a full spread on Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes
is planned to coincide with the release of the feature
film "Sylvia and Ted". She added with enthusiasm that
"Sylvia's story combines all the things we love to see
spliced together in one big tragedy: a tall, willowy beautiful
woman of immense intelligence, fire and sexuality." "And, "
she continued,"you capit it off with a broken heart and a
quiet, Betty Croker-like suicide, and you've got the makings
for a cult heroine who will go on in the century to come to be
treated as a patron-saint for soccer-moms and  teenage
poetesses alike." I asked here if I could quote her and she
consented as long as she remains anonymous.

This set me to remember Samuel R. Delany's amazing book,
"Einstein Intersection", where, in a post-apocalyptic landscape,
centuries on, the essences of Jean Harlow, Ringo Starr and
Billy the Kid along with Jesus are recast and replayed. The
novel could have just as easily been driven by Princess Di,
Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, etc.  Any listers know it? After
talking to my friend I now think Sylvia and Ted could as
easily be inserted...

Hiya,

i'm looking for a page citation for the oft-quoted but
as far as i have so
far found never cited in detail Lautreamont image:

'He is handsome . . . as the fortuitous encounter on a
dissecting table of a
sewing machine and an umbrella'

I've got a 1970 edition of the Alexis Lykiard
translation (Alison and Busby)
and would at least hope that somebody hereabouts has
an idea which of the
six 'songs' it comes from if not an actual page number
given that editions
will differ. I'm wanting to read what leads up to and
follows on from this
ubiquitous quote.

I've scanned through it several times today and still
not spotted it.
Various book trawls and web searches have thrown up
numerous references but
no actual reference.

any help appreciated. Back channel i guess to save the
list.

love and love
cris

Dear George,

When you next talk to your Conde Nast chum, could you ask her what in the
hell is meant by a "Betty-Crocker-like suicide"? Is somebody trying to
tell me that Betty Crocker is dead, and the era of the layer cake in the
US is over?

I wonder if this can't be usefully framed somewhat differently.  That
is, in terms of poets' relationship to the academy and academic
thinking, or poets who consider the academy as the site of contemporary
poetic culture and poets who either are not associated with the academy
or who view it as a decent employer for who they will labor diligently
(after their own manner) but will not have their notions of what poetry
can be soiled with the recreative writing culture of prizes, networking,
and all the other filthy habits of . . . well.

As Williams predicted, little good can come of poetry's association with
the universities.  The best can be said: it gives us a place to eat, but
we get lazy, shit and sleep there as well, and wake up with business
cards coming out of our ears. (Best way to deal with it?  Wear a mask,
keep the motor running.)

Case in point.  Relations between poets of different generations.  When
I wrote "From Gloucester Out" by Ed Dorn was a fuck-off poem, I was
trying to open the measure to all those ways we relate between
generations.  And to establish, at least provisionally, a "natural order
of things" (please, no post-structural debates), artists to artists,
compared to the manner in which artists relate within the academies--and
I don't care if it's the New School in San Francisco, SUNY-Buffalo,
Naropa, Black Mountain, Florida State, or Iowa. (Perhaps the co-option
of poetry by the academy has a pernicious effect in this regard beyond
even its borders. Loose among us.)

Let me ask two basic questions.

1.) If poetry was not now so bound to the universities, how would poets
relate to each other in terms of sheer geography?  (I want to focus only
on those who are really interested in poetry and not the toadies,
taggers-along, whatever it is which wich our age seems so well stocked.)
Would they gather in cities, choosing where they went by what kind of
city they wanted? Or because it's a haven of East Coast jazz? Who would
they find there? Or if they'd read about the Pacific Northwest and
decided to try logging and writing. Would they find others of their
kind, young _and_ old?   That's been my experience.  Or perhaps young
poets would camp out on the lawns of older poets, "to knock with decency
/ that a Blunt should open," that is, they might gravitate to certain
older poets, introduce themselves (or not, in the case of Berrigan with
O'Hara, at least for some time), and then attempt to be in the older
poet's presence as much as suits everyone involved. Typically, the
younger poet will have read much of the older poet's work before giving
the older poet his or her work to read. (Here, can you hear the scream
of the point, the difference I am _going_ to make?) Or the relationship
can be through the "geography" of the postal service, like Olson and
Creeley, who later claimed that distance was one his greatest teacher,
since he had to be clear in the mails. He and Olson sometimes wrote each
other twice a day. (But then there was no great artistic generational
divide between these two. The correspondence is nearly among equals, at
Olson's insistence. I sure you can think of your own, better,
examples.)  How many other ways might such relationships occur and how
would these relationships unfold in manners that the academy can barely
understand?  Or, even, how might a younger poet expresses his or her
feelings upon departing from the older, a painful but necessary
separation (which Dorn prolongs to the end of the poem, he can't let go,
. . . almost).

Or maybe that's too idealistic?  What the hell do I know?  I'm _in_ the
academy.  (You might want to check out the above through the biographies
you know of poets or artists prior to the middle of the
twentieth-century.)

2.) Now, how do relationships in the academy occur? Since this is the
world I assume (I hope I'm wrong) that most of us know, I'll not belabor
it.  Just a few observations.  I've heard young poets ask older poets to
chair their dissertations in creative writing who only know the older
poets' work from the few readings they may have attended (when it didn't
interfere with some playoff).

Another: a young man who is finishing his master's came to me recently
to ask me for letters of recommendation to half a dozen schools for a
Ph.D. in creative writing (if you can imagine such a beast!).  Not
thinking, I asked him, "Oh, who's at University X?"  Turned out he
couldn't tell me the name of even one poet in one program.  I suggest
this case is not the exception.  Perhaps he will like the climate.

Another: A young fiction writer of some talent entered our program
(Univ. of Louisiana, Lafayette) a dozen years back and told me all he
wanted from our university was Ernest Gaines's Rolodex.  That's it.  A
real pragmatist. At least he had read Gaines.

Enough.

Basically I'm posing the question (and suggesting the answer) of what
the academy has done in terms of relationships between poets.  (But,
please, every age has had its share of sycophants, malingerers, toadies,
etc. I do not mean these. I'm thinking of poets like those who went to
Pound in the 40s, or of Pound who went to Yeats, or of Dorn who woke to
find himself, happily, in the presence of Olson, or did he go there
because of him?) I'm more than willing to be persuaded that my view is
naive (though I think it damn well holds for most of the poets I've ever
cared to care about) or wrongheaded.

This list, whatever one calls it, has probably considered such issues
from the start, so I'll understand if there's no response.

But if you think that there might be some truth to the above
observations, then the question is, as always, what now?

***my apologies if you receive this multiple times***

yes, the time is upon us once again, the time when the sense that the world
is full of people seated atop thirty foot poles with their ears finely tuned
for the sound of one hand as it claps in the wind dusts off its shoulders
and rudely makes its own way in from the cold like some sort of belligerent
person.  why be cold?  we might want to ask for our own very special
reasons.  in the matter of a fight the law will always seek out the victor
as the transgressor.  so why not make a night of it?

imagine:

Nikki Reimer-- air in the matter of a secret, lacunae that frustrate
familial albums, and that not only on full moon nights, Nikki Reimer should
be listed as a powerful natural force of kindness in whatever almanac you
regularly turn to when in need, and she will mesmerize, oh yes, yes she
will.

Francais Kruk-- the recipe should include several wolves, a scarf, some
chocolate, an invocation of Edgar Cayce (any will do, though in a pinch I'd
reccommend the one made by our friends at the goodly Nabisco company for
added pluck), something borrowed, and something blue so as to produce the
most excellent conditions for our spirits to be wizened by Francais Kruk's
totalimmersiontheatre.

Nicole Markotic--  there are two figures with catapaults way up on Nose
Hill, and somewhere, unbidden, a costume shop opens with a voice that says
quietly behind your left ear:  "never mind that, it is damn cold out here,
so go to the hop n brew to hear Nicole Markotic read!"

skip, that's an interesting prod... i'm an academic too, and a poet,
and i rather see the situation in academe as being more fraught (i'd
say) than do you... i.e., more in terms of jed rasula's ~american
poetry wax museum~... i.e., that poetry has in essence gone
underground in academe, even as the new critical techniques
implemented by trade poets (qua academics) in the 30s and 40s have
become something of s-o-p (at least when we do "close readings" and
the like)...

rasula detects 4 zones at work in the contemporary us "poetry
world":  the associated writing programs; the new formalism; language
poetry; and "various coalitions of interest-oriented or
community-based poets"... more recently, mark wallace has identified
5 "major networks of poetry production," two of which correspond
roughly to rasula's "awp" (wallace uses the mfa designation) and "new
formalism" zones (for wallace, "traditional form"); his remaining
three "networks" comprise identity-based poetries (with a strong mfa
component), speech-based poetries, and avant-garde poetries (see
wallace's provocative essay in the fine compendium he coedited with
steven marks, ~telling it slant~; i trust i'm paraphrasing
properly)...

this is an oblique way perhaps of extending the discussion you
desire, i know... on a somewhat more anecdotal basis:  of the 50
tenured and tenure-track faculty here at cu, i would say that perhaps
a half-dozen (three scholars, three creative writers) have any real
working knowledge of poetry as a contemporary practice... the most
one can ask of the faculty in my dept is that they've had some
exposure to some modernists, and a few contemporary names... most
scholars know more about pop cultural discourse, i'd say, than
something as comprehensive as the rothenberg/joris volumes, and what
these latter might mean for poetry, past and present... further,
attendance at poetry readings and the like is woeful if judged by
faculty attendance (albeit this perhaps takes us in another
direction, as much the same can be said for poets attending critical
theory talks)...

anyway, just some thoughts, skip (and others)... thanx for the occasion...

best,

joe

Again with the academy. What is this? To read this list you'd think the
academy was the source of all that's wrong with poetry. I can't help
feeling that some of this must stem from an exaggerated *faith* in the
academy's mission -- i.e. an outraged sense that our universities are
failing to carry out their ancient noble mission of preserving and
promoting the best of culture. How do I break this to the Andrew Rathmanns
of the world? The academy was always already behind. Knowing this, the best
poets don't give a FUCK.

Would a grad student's perspective help here? The people who thrive in
university environments are typically the shy and frail. They're the kids
that got picked last for kickball, for whom good grades were the only token
of the world's approval. Little surprise that they would gravitate to the
shelter of the academy, where they can enjoy the company of other misfits
and continue to receive good grades into adulthood. These are people who
hardly go out! Whose most meaningful relationships are to books and fellow
critics of books, not living writers! Why then are we surprised at the
tameness of their tastes, and their readiness to follow established trends?
What do you even think poetry *is*, if you think it can be co-opted?

I'm glad that others of my generation have found support and guidance from
older poets. I really am -- I mean that without any irony. I just see no
sense in pretending that it's been the case with me, and you're not going
to hear any older poets piping up in protest. In fact it's a little point
of pride that my every opportunity in Poetry World has come thanks to
people my own age (more or less) and younger. And my saying so shouldn't
threaten anyone. Unless you think the future belongs to minor poets like
myself, in which case you better start kissing my ass.

Bob Grenier rocks, Kevin and Dodie rule. And they live closer to the edge
than I do. Lyn Hejinian was nice to me once. That's it, my fingers are cold
and the clammy tomb awaits LRSN

well, a crock of shit if yr including MFA students in w/"grad" students.
I've been in the MFA program at Umass for 3 years now...ours is a 60 credit
program where we take lit courses along w/the MA/PHDs. I've been here so
long because we've got a great union and I've got a great advising job where
I get paid to send emails to the listserve. Why am I in a MFA program??
Well, after having made it up to assistant manager at the dollar type store
I was working at in Northampton, and having to work a lot of hours and
trying to write at night I figured it would give me time. And it did, but it
also gave me community! Yes, it's problamatic that I needed to go to a
university to find it, but I do not live in a large city with a multiplicity
of differing poetry scenes.

Anyway, as far as the mentor issue, there really wasn't anyone here like
that. Peter Gizzi came here last year and he's been great, great because of
his insistance that everyone create their own community, start journals, do
reading etc,--and beacues of his insistance that those communities are
VALID, that one doesn't need a prize to be a poet. etc.

As far as most of the PHD students here: I can't stand them! There really is
a divide between PHD/MFAs...we're looked down on/talked down to and envied
at the same time...

anyway, I think it's intresting that I've learned the most from my friends,
from reading their work, from talking with them etc. The MFA was just an
excuse to get us togther...   do I want to teach? I'm not sure, I don't want
to work a 9-5...

anyway, back to work...

noah

CIRCULARS has become a pretty distinctive mixture of writings by poets and
artists (including satires, leaflets, and the "Mirakove Relays"), report
activities (including news of arrests), links to political humor sites, a
repository for articles covering things you won't hear about in the news
(including government leaks and floor speeches), and some lively debate pro
and con (look at the comments bar).  Thanks to all of the editors, writers
and hecklers who have contributed so far!

We were also recently written about in an article in the Village Voice:
http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0308/clover.php.  The article prompted
over 5,000 hits over the past 4 days -- 1300 on Thursday alone.

One can question what a site like CIRCULARS or any indy media site does to
stop the march toward war -- I do myself -- but there is no doubt that a lot
of information and opinion has moved through the internet consolidating
public anti-war sentiment in a way that is not happening on television, and
that the web can spark new ways of imagining and enacting protest -- of
creating a culture with its own points of focus, senses of humor, etc. --
that couldn't have happened 20 years ago.  As many people are reading
indy-media sites online, and what flies into their inboxes, as are reading
the New York Times, and they are not necessarily radicals "in the know,"
with the right subscriptions and contacts.

I still hope that something some poet writes for CIRCULARS or any site, like
Poets Against The War, becomes as addictive as the Senator Byrd speech has
been for those with email trigger fingers -- "forcing the hand of chance,"
as they used to say.  If I can be faulted for thinking of this as a media
war leading up to the "real thing," I think it's an ok mistake to make -- I
think of the entire Homeland Security Department as a multi-media
department, lodging their camouflaged, gun-toting performance artists in the
NYC subways at their will, and without petitioning for handouts.  This all
seems so incredibly shameful and insulting to me; I hope they keep doing it
if only to embarrass themselves further.

Perhaps we can bring it to a point where we can organize worldwide protests
EVERY WEEK -- sounds ridiculous of course, but not impossible.  But I,
personally, think the protests made a difference, if not in the US then to
the people the US will have to talk to for airspace, foot soldiers, or even
a sympathetic chat on the phone (or in the headlines).  This one feel good
moment is not enough, and people seem willing to spend a few hours walking
in the same street.

Other site news: today I'm installing a search engine!

Please pass on word of Circulars to friends of yours who might be
interested, and especially to other site and listservs who might include
them in a links column, blogroll, etc.

Here's a few items that have appeared recently (the first paragraph of each
entry is included -- all the stories go on from there):

Bookseller Purges Files to Avoid Potential "Patriot Act" Searches
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000209.html

In the interest of avoiding potential searches under the Patriot Act, Bear
Pond Books in Montpelier, Vermont has already discarded the names of books
bought by its readers' club, and will purge purchase records for customers
if they ask. "When the CIA comes and asks what you've read because they're
suspicious of you, we can't tell them because we don't have it," store
co-owner Michael Katzenberg said. "That's just a basic right, to be able to
read what you want without fear that somebody is looking over your shoulder
to see what you're reading."

War On Iraq?
(leaflet for Teach-Ins)
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000204.html#000204

Over the past year and a half the Bush administration has put forth a
variety of arguments for prosecuting a war on Iraq to unseat Saddam Hussein.
Keeping up with these arguments can be confusing—partly because they keep
changing. At the same time, both here and abroad, challenges to the
administration's reasoning continue to mount. What follows is an attempt to
break down the major areas of debate.

Empire At The Brink: A Call To Action
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000203.html#000203

We stand truly at an historical juncture, with several directions mapped
before us, and several more unknown. Yesterday's protests demonstrated an
immense will for peace around the world, a growing sense "the people" have
had enough. While immensely inspiring, the moment also calls for a clarity
of mind, to assess the powers before and behind us, as well as within, and
the road ahead. We must not underestimate the technological and ideological
behemoth massed at the borders of Iraq and lodged in the minds of the men
who command it.

Account of the Clark/Shaw Arrest

Many friends have asked for more details about our spending the night in
jail for taping up flyers last Thursday, February '3. So we wanted to offer
a description of what happened.  First of all, the flyers we were putting up
were images of daily life in Baghdad taken by Paul Chan. As many of you
know, Chan was in Baghdad in December and January as part of the Iraq Peace
Team, a project of Voices in the Wilderness. Last Thursday night about fifty
people met to pick up 8.5 x ''-inch copies of Chan's photos and begin
posting them around Manhattan. The goal, of course, was to particularize and
humanize our soon-to-be victims.

Mirakove Relay#2: On Patriot Act II
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000199.html#000199

CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY OBTAINS SECRET DRAFT OF PATRIOT ACT II

The nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity has obtained a draft
of a secret document called the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003.
This document is more commonly known as the Patriot Act II, and is designed
to "give the government broad, sweeping new powers to increase domestic
intelligence-gathering, surveillance and law enforcement prerogatives, and
simultaneously decrease judicial review and public access to information."
You can download the document here:

Kasey S. Mohammad
Acknowledged Legislators: A Rant
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000194.html#000194

I sense that the poetry community is in a sensitive transitional period
right now. By "the poetry community," I mean all the thousands of people who
write poetry and who are increasingly more aware of each other's views and
activities than historically ever before thanks largely to electronic
technology. And by "sensitive" I mean simultaneously very promising of
increased dialogue and cooperation, and very delicately poised on the brink
of bitter conflict. It seems trivial to use such a phrase when the world is
poised on the brink of a much bitterer conflict, but it is especially that
larger conflict, along with poets' responses to it, that has advanced this
transitional phase dramatically in the past month or so.

At times it felt like hell on wheels. But the peace activists who travelled
across a continent by London double-decker bus arrived at a Baghdad bomb
shelter yesterday with their sense of mission just about intact. Few places
in Baghdad convey the horror of war as sharply as the al-Ameriya shelter,
where 400 Iraqi civilians were incinerated by US missiles during the last
Gulf war.

Reckless Administration May Reap Disastrous Consequences
Senate Floor Speech - Wednesday, February 12, 2003
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000165.html#000165

To contemplate war is to think about the most horrible of human experiences.
On this February day, as this nation stands at the brink of battle, every
American on some level must be contemplating the horrors of war. Yet, this
Chamber is, for the most part, silent -- ominously, dreadfully silent. There
is no debate, no discussion, no attempt to lay out for the nation the pros
and cons of this particular war. There is nothing.

nationalphilistine.com: Baghdad Snapshot Action goes online and worldwide
http://www.arras.net/circulars/archives/000168.html#000168

[New York City]-- On February 13, 2003, teams of artists and activists
postered New York City with thousands of copies of snapshots from Baghdad.
Quiet and casual, the snapshots show a part of Baghdad we rarely see: the
part with people in it.  The snapshots were taken by a friend of ours who
just got back from Baghdad working with the Iraq Peace Team (link below).
Yes, he saw Iraqis suffering and struggling. But he also saw Iraqis dancing
and laughing. This moved him because laughing under the weight of the UN
sanctions and the threat of an absurd war is no easy task. We were moved
because the people in the pictures remind us of our friends & family.

        We may not have chosen to live inside Dick Cheney’s mind, but we do.
        Wyoming, I read somewhere, is the safest place to live in North
America.
        No tornados, no tsunamis, no earthquakes, no hurricanes, monsoons,
cyclones, or floods. No major airport: no big planes crashing in the sleet.
Not even much traffic: not too many car crashes.
        But if living in Wyoming is so safe, living inside Dick Chaney’s
mind, though it was formed in Wyoming and stood for Wyoming in the Senate,
is not safe at all.
        How do you get from Wyoming to Shock and Awe?

Subject:      Chris Emery on SADLY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Chris Emery recently posted (to another list) the following comments on
William Fuller's SADLY (Flood Editions, 2003). I am sending them along with
his permission:

---------------------
I've just finished my fourth or fifth reading of "Sadly" by William Fuller,

and I think it marks a further development of this fantastically gifted

writer. It's a simply majestic book and you must go and buy it.


Surely this marks Fuller out as a -major- writer in English now -- the

language is just charging through him, I don't want to suggest that this is

a book of chi-chi pyrotechnics, though there's phenomenal skill on show here

(for example, in "Down in the Dive" or the verbally perfect "Mobile Steam

Plant/Spare Change" ), no, this is a book of tremendous grace -- a set of

meditations for our time. Or perhaps its a logbook, for you'll be taken on a

journey through this book, not a descent into the filthy circles, but a

silver arc up out of the top of your head.


All those surprises of diction and narrative are perfectly counterbalanced

with lightness of touch and joy. This is clearly a new metaphysical writing

-- sensual and transfiguring. The sheer delight of language and playfulness

of "Aether" -- a book I couldn't put down for months -- are here in "Sadly",

but where one sensed the pleasure of the poet back then was in continuous

surprise and accident at finding new forms and new paths and delighting in

the strange permission of extension and submission, we can see here a

restraint and philosophy and, well, spirituality taking charge of the whole

factory of effects. And what a factory.


Spirituality -- now there's a word I'd normally run wild from terrified into

the warehouses and malls of secular showtime, yet Fuller has created a work

of tremendous spiritual poise, nothing lofty you understand, but completely

uplifting -- in fact it's his playfulness and artfulness that are here under

a new kind of religious control (Atheists do not be scared), not some formal

clamping down but a control of intent and trajectory. We're swinging away on

the star paths of some new sense of the human, taken up with some

dematerialised sense of journeying out. You'll go with this man, you'll be

whisked away, and at the end of the book you'll return to a new territory,

and glad to see the glassworks of the world shining with fresh pouches of

light.


Maybe it's the materiality or transubstantiation of the poems, but I'm

feeling wholly refreshed by it. In these dark times, and the circuitous

paths of poetic ingestion, here is someone to clasp hands with and step back

to the wide-eyed miracle of it all.


Go read.

I agree forcefully with this statement. Building a group of friends to

Subject:      DWP conference Baltimore
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Here's the final conference line-up in Baltimore, Thursday February 27-
Saturday March 1:

Thursday 2/27 at the 14 Karat Cabaret Lounge @ 8:30 pm

town hall discussion on Surrealism
reading by "The Dissociated Writer"
performance by et at it
et at it, formerly Ra Ra Fre + Am is two guitars and a bass. I'd describe it
as a strange mixture of process music and Primus-like bass-lines, with
vocals that don't refer to anything explicitly, but are more  like
fricatives and uvular plosives. The bassist was in a band in the nineties
called the Metamatics, which set the tone for post-punk. This is their last
concert ever. The guitarist is moving to New York.


Friday at Paloma's @ 8:30 pm
town hall discussion on Is Bad Art Good?/Is Good Art Bad?
readings by the DWP contest winners
Is Bad Art Good?/Is Good Art Bad? will consist of ten to twenty short
lectures on the aesthetics of a variety of usually unrepresented art forms
by a tattoo artist, a belly dancer, a plastic surgeon, a mannequin maker, a
collegiate football player, a jump-rope specialist, a comic book artist, a
talk show host, an etiquette specialist, aerospace engineer, biological and
evolutionary scientist, auto-body engineer, etcetera.

Saturday at The Sidebar @ 8:30 pm
town hall discussion on the End of Literature and Art
readings by DWP readers
performances by Thee Snuff Project & The Black Eyes
Thee Snuff Project is a really awesome sort of nouveau cock-rock band. The
lead singer will often bring a butterfly knife on stage and threaten to end
it all right there. He's kidding of course. But he sings like he means it.
The Black Eyes are perhaps the best, edgiest, DC punk band on the scene. I
don't know how to describe their sound except to say, fucking good. They
were just signed by Dischord and are notorious for putting on great shows.


By going to this conference you will be participating too. The Surrealism
discussion will have much in the way of audience involvement, perhaps even
writing exercises and men in funny suits. If you come to the Surrealism
discussion, you can dress in whatever costume you want and fit right in. The
End of Literature and Art discussion will concentrate on aesthetic
possibilities given the direction the arts have come from and the direction
they seem to be going. We can't divulge the names of the authors and artists
who are taking the reins of these discussions, because the focus is on
ideas, not reputations or personalities. But we can say that they come from
all walks of life.

You want to get involved? Display art on the walls, breakdance in one of the
five rooms Paloma's has given us? Present your idea to us on our web site:
www.dissociatedwritersproject.com. Or give our office phone a call: (202)
253-0464. This is a locally-grown conference, planned by punks with an
interest in shaking things up. Any and all ideas are welcome.

Brad Senning

almost as much fun as an allstar ballot.  but here you can only vote once
every 24 hours.  What am I going to do with all the other time on my hands?

I realize that this is probably the wrong list to ask this question of, but,
just in case any of you happen to have first editions: does anyone have first
editions of John Ciardi's children's books (with dustjackets) from the late
fifties (Reason for the Pelican) or later, specifically, those children's books
edited by Edward Gorey? If so, let me know off-list.

Thanks a bunch,

Forgive the Faux-determinism and asian evid/dence=absente[rms] but,
Actually the evidence shows there was also a very long sequence of "token"
use before actual written language developed, these tokens were usually made
of clay and had several functions.. the "realationship" to counting has also
been studied as an important factor..
Denise Schmandt-Besserat's excellent _Before Writing_ series "from counting
to cuneiform"
is one source for this thread..

i was thinking of the account of the
Clark/Shaw arrest when my friend G
told me he had been arrested last Sun.
in Soho, luckily he had been able to
stow the glass pins and broaches he makes
in Helena Rubinstein. His story was similar
to the Clark/Shaw affair, tho w/o the moralizing.
The finger print machine was broken; he was moved
more than once to one that did work & he spent a
total of ten hours in incarceration before he
was released. He had been picked up in a sweep
right next to a guy selling knock off Gucci bags,
a high priority item on the police agenda that week.
He sd rather matter of factly that since he had
a picture i.d., it was and is police policy to just
issue a summons. G. is working class, 50 to 60, his father
drove one of those grinding machine trucks of my
South Bronx Youth. He used to work in a fancy SOHO
gallery before the wive's of rich dentists got
tired of decorating their hubby's offices with
Erte...whatever...

As someone with an extensive crime career
from small small town Southern jails to big city
lock ups, SOME ADVICE. The beat cop or the arresting
sweep officer is yr Best Friend. They have a job to
do, they've been told by their command to do it, and
they invariably would rather be doing something else.
Clark/Shaw would have been better off reading Human Rights
Watches' Report on Torture in Iraq than irritating the police.
They also would have been better off putting up the pictures of some millions of millions of dead Iraquis than perfectly good live ones...whatever..

My last appearance in Court some two summers ago
might be instructive. 100's upon 100's of people,
some 5 hours of busy busy paper work. I spent most
of the time reading a 19th century edition of Paradise Lost remembering how large Satan was, a league and a
league. Finally in Court, my favorite detainee was an old
man who had been arrested for public intoxication. He told the judge he lived on the street and was drinking in his own home. DISMISSED...The public defender presented my case "He SAYS he was selling books"....the judge not looking up from his own mound of paperwork...'DISMISSED'...

A demonstration IS "not a good place for a pregnant
woman" If Clark/Shaw can't figure that out that, they
shouldn't be allowed outside by themselves. Better to be
at home trans. Iraqui Po...the street for the street wise..

So, what does it mean if you're in an MFA program, studying with Bob Grenier
and you truly were always the last one picked for kickball?

I guess time will tell . . .

Again with the academy. What is this? To read this list you'd think the
academy was the source of all that's wrong with poetry. I can't help
feeling that some of this must stem from an exaggerated *faith* in the
academy's mission -- i.e. an outraged sense that our universities are
failing to carry out their ancient noble mission of preserving and
promoting the best of culture. How do I break this to the Andrew Rathmanns
of the world? The academy was always already behind. Knowing this, the best
poets don't give a FUCK.

Would a grad student's perspective help here? The people who thrive in
university environments are typically the shy and frail. They're the kids
that got picked last for kickball, for whom good grades were the only token
of the world's approval. Little surprise that they would gravitate to the
shelter of the academy, where they can enjoy the company of other misfits
and continue to receive good grades into adulthood. These are people who
hardly go out! Whose most meaningful relationships are to books and fellow
critics of books, not living writers! Why then are we surprised at the
tameness of their tastes, and their readiness to follow established trends?
What do you even think poetry *is*, if you think it can be co-opted?

I'm glad that others of my generation have found support and guidance from
older poets. I really am -- I mean that without any irony. I just see no
sense in pretending that it's been the case with me, and you're not going
to hear any older poets piping up in protest. In fact it's a little point
of pride that my every opportunity in Poetry World has come thanks to
people my own age (more or less) and younger. And my saying so shouldn't
threaten anyone. Unless you think the future belongs to minor poets like
myself, in which case you better start kissing my ass.

Bob Grenier rocks, Kevin and Dodie rule. And they live closer to the edge
than I do. Lyn Hejinian was nice to me once. That's it, my fingers are cold
and the clammy tomb awaits LRSN

Now that you have the date set for this event, I guess it's only a
matter of time before you get around to letting us know what
continent it's taking place on, right?

Good thing we still have a week or so to make travel plans (if it's
not happening down the street from here).

Florida Court Issues Historic Marriage and Custody Decision for=20
Transgender Dad
The National Center for Lesbian Rights and local attorney Collin Vause=20=

represented Michael Kantaras in a divorce and custody case in which=20
Michael's wife asked the court to declare him a legal stranger to the=20
couples two children.
   TAMPA, FL -- =A0In a groundbreaking decision, Florida Circuit Court=20=

Judge Gerard O'Brien ruled today that Michael Kantaras, a transgender=20
man, is legally male and was legally married to his former wife Linda=20
Kantaras, stating that "the Court has carefully reviewed all the=20
pleadings, record evidence, expert medical testimony, lay witness=20
testimony and the appropriate statutory authority for marriage in=20
Florida and concludes the overwhelming weight of evidence favors=20
declaring the marriage valid." Final Judgment at pp. 806-07. The court=20=

also awarded Michael primary custody of the two children he and Linda=20
raised together during their marriage.
    Judge O'Brien's opinion is one of a handful of decisions addressing=20=

marriages involving transsexual spouses, and one of the first in the=20
United States to hold that such marriages are valid. =A0The only states=20=

with similarly favorable decisions are New Jersey and California; in=20
contrast, Texas and Kansas courts have held that marriages involving=20
transsexual individuals are void. =A0 Internationally, courts in a =
number=20
of countries have affirmed the validity of such marriages, including a=20=

very recent decision by the Family Court of Australia upholding a=20
marriage between Kevin J., a female-to-male transsexual, and Jennifer,=20=

his wife.
    After completing sex-reassignment, Michael Kantaras met and married=20=

his wife, Linda in 1989. =A0 Linda was fully aware of Michael's=20
transgender status prior to the marriage and permitted Michael to adopt=20=

her then three month old son. =A0The couple later had a daughter through=20=

Subject:      greetings + announcement

Poetics.ca now on-line

As an attempt to discuss the range of contemporary practice in modern
poetry, we are pleased to announce the first issue of Poetics.ca
(www.poetics.ca).

Based in Ottawa, but wide-ranging in scope (and completely on-line),
Poetics.ca will work to explore the astonishing diversity of approaches
to poetic text, with a focus on writing by Canadian authors. The site is
designed to evolve with each new issue, with the help of its
contributors and audience. The first issue, now on-line, includes ideas
about poetry from David McGimpsey and nathalie stephens (statements on
poetics), Colin Morton (on American poets Rachel Loden and Wendy Battin)
and Andy Weaver ("That Bastard Ghazal"), and a conversation/interview
between Stephanie Bolster and rob mclennan.

The site is not intended to express a single poetic, but to provide a
forum for energetic dialogue between diverse poetics. It will regularly
feature essays, manifestos, reviews of recent work, letters from our
readers, and extended essays. Please visit Poetics.ca and send us your
thoughts.

Stephen Brockwell and rob mclennan, editors

A young poet friend of mine, Micah Ballard, wrote me after he first
moved to San Francisco, that he occasionally saw Coolidge around town,
coffee shops or whatever, and asked me if I thought it would be
appropriate if he introduced himself.  I told him he should feel
comfortable to introduce himself to anyone he cared about.  So confident
was I in Micah's ability to read, I was sure he would rarely be
rebuffed.  How could you read Coolidge and _not_ know he would be
receptive? Or Mayer? Or Clark?  Or Hejinian? (And I don't care who I'm
putting side by side.)  And who would _ever_ be interested in meeting
Angelou?

After 6 months in the city, Micah would never think of asking me such a
question, so obvious are such answers.

Is there any other art-form or part of American society where youth is as
large a liability than in poetry?  I'd say nowhere.  Imagine novelists or
filmmakers dissing the youngsters in their biz.  They'd be burned at the
stake.  Pass the marshmallows.

We're supposed to sit back and wait until we're 80 for what?  Publication,
Bollingen, affirmation?  So we can oppress those younger than us?  Ha.

And this stems out of nothing if not envy.  Envy of youth, envy of vigor and
envy of time.  And it's not just L. Fagin, and if you don't get that you're
deluded.  It's you, grandpa and grandma.  Poet meet mirror.  If you aren't
actively involved with inspiring and supporting the great poems being
written by younger generations, you are the problem.

I think younger poets should stop buying the books and magazines of
established generations, for, say, five years.  Buy a friend's book.  Buy a
first book, instead.  Buy a new magazine.  Show publishers that we're
economically viable.  Put that W.S. Merwin down.  Put down that APR.

There's been a lot of static on the weblogs about that one line I put in
that speech.  Whatever, it's a challenge.  You are the future.  What we say
could be valuable or it could be worthless.

This List is often one of the most worthless and depressing places in all of
poetry.  Maybe these discussions can rise up, over the jackal static, but
that's a real rarity.  Can you imagine a publisher publishing what's been
happening on this list for the past 2 1/2 years?  Ha ha ha.  No, never.

Younger generations will be making decisions, in anthologies, in what's
in-print and what's out-of-print, in what gets taught and what fades away.
It's not up to you, it's up to us.  Enjoy some sun, it will set.

Peace Out.
Jim Behrle

The horse you're flogging looks dead to me, Jim. Yale doesn't offer
an Older Poet Prize, and publication of and prizes for first books by
younger poets seem to outnumber those of last books by older poets
by about a zillion to two.

This is a really GREAT e-mail Jim!  and of course it's true!

although i do want to say that there are some older poets who are NOT part of that competitive-needs-therapy-REAL-BAD set.  Alice Notley for one.  i didn't doubt her sincerity for ONE SECOND after hearing her give a lecture at Temple about a year ago where she said IT'S THE YOUNGER POETS she pays attention to.  she followed it up by saying the dogma of her generation is boring.  HER approach to the idea of us younger poets not having "a focal point" or whatever the fuck it is we're supposed to have, is that it's GREAT, it's LIBERATING, it's BEYOND THE BULLSHIT!

i'll ALWAYS remember her saying those things, some poets of her generation sitting RIGHT THERE while she said it.  That woman has REAL courage!  And she's a GREAT writer on top of the courage!

she's not the only one of course.  there's plenty of others, Eileen Myles for instance, who just read in Philadelphia the other night, BLOWING our hair back with her VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS!  she's NOTHING but interested in supporting younger writers.  i remember hearing her read in New York a couple of years ago where someone moaned about the ENORMOUS number of poets writing these days, "SO MUCH competition, wah wah wah" Eileen sort of snorted and laughed and said, "THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM!"

but to be honest with you, the older poets (and yes, we know who they are, FOR SURE!) who treat younger poets like shit, man, just IGNORE THEM!  there's NOTHING they hate more than being ignored!  if they ever get their shit together they'll remember that we'll still be here after they're finally dead, removing their sorry asses from the bookshelves of the world.  sort of like the bumper sticker, "BE NICE TO YOUR KIDS, THEY'LL CHOOSE YOUR NURSING HOME ONE DAY!"

but i like ignoring assholes more than playing the old Golden Bough game.  who is really THAT interested in climbing the hill to kill the king?  fuck the king, he's already dead.  that's a Death Wail you hear, all that bitching and whining they make.

thanks for your perfectly splendid outrage Jim Behrle!

Funny, I didn't start getting the publishing and reading opportunities many
younger poets get till after I was 55. I had to make a living outside of
literature at a job I hated and write at night till my mind and body gave
out, then keep doing it.

About 12 years ago a young poet seemed to cop an attitude when I was doing a
poetry-music duo with the legendary saxophonist Thomas Chaplin at the Middle
East in Cambridge. I was put off by the younger poet's attitude because he
apparently fancied himself the "Young Turk" and resented what he perceived
as my "position." Funny thing was, my "position" had been acquired at the
expense of a total physical and mental collapse at age 45 that I never fully
recovered from and I lost money doing the gig on top of everything. Because
of the lack of recognition given me, I had to remain a "young Turk" well
past the age when I should have ahem gone to pasture. In performance, I've
blown away at least two "famous poets," but they continue to get work in
career-enhancing venues while I continue to get overlooked---often by
younger poets, curiously enough.

I have no beef with younger poets. I want to read anybody who's writing
fresh exciting stuff that keeps my mind alive and challenges me to do
better, to go a step further. At 57, complacency is my enemy, as it is with
younger writers. I haven't "made it" so I have to keep my edge. I admit that
I have received some very nice opportunities with more to come, but I don't
have a nest of laurels I can rest on yet.

I would certainly take offense at an older poet who presumes that because
one is a certain age one hasn't paid their dues without reading one's work.
(Wasn't Rimbaud writing his best stuff at 19?) It sucks. But it's also the
typical career path in many fields. You work your way up in your 20's and
30's. In your 40's you start getting the cushy gigs that let your
ever-fattening jowls droop till they overhang your ever-fattening butt. From
50 on, you ride out the string.

That's how the game is played. I don't control it.

Being a young poet is difficult-being a young ANYTHING is difficult--- but
in most cases being an old poet isn't any easier. Since I spent much of my
life working as a musician as well as a writer and having a day job, let me
say that there are some benefits to being a writer as you age. Through
experience, you gain insights that are very different from your 20's, 30's
or 40's. After a few decades, your craft develops so that you can execute
phrases almost instantly. You can continue to be creative without your body
paying the price for playing till 3:00 A.M. and having to go to work the
next day. When your reflexes finally go, your mind still stays sharp for a
few decades.

Shut up and write. That's what I've done. And do.

Umm, what does that mean?? that when one's older one writes faster? Maybe
that's how it worked for you, but I can execute phrases pretty quick--you
should see how many poems I killed today!

ps: there's this great passage in Waldrop's book about Jabes where she
mention a tango contest (i think it was tango??) the Jabes' won. Everyone
else there was about half their age...

hey y'all,
            Sunday March 2nd, 1-3 PM (the crack of dawn, i know) The =
Bowery Poetry Club is hosting a new reading series--check out our

SILLY PRESS RELEASE

Bowery Poetry Club's new monthly Under The Influence reading series =
gives New York's younger poets an opportunity to read their own work and =
present an informal talk on/reading of the work of a poet who's =
influenced them.  This series puts together two up and coming poets with =
one of the New York area's most successful young poets-it's a showcase =
of exciting new poetry, and an attempt to bring a little diversity to =
the old poetic gene pool.  Check out this month's line up:=20

Tom Kelly is a Columbia Senior from Iowa (the state).  His poetry rocks =
harder than ocelot on speed.  Chance operations, found poems, or just =
the old-fashioned 'fuck you' genre, Tom's got it all. =20

Tom is going to talk about Jackson Mac Low's The Pronouns.

Justin Jamail was born and grew up in Houston, Texas.  He has been in =
NYC for five years and now lives in Brooklyn.  Reading one of Justin's =
poems leaves you thinking that it makes perfect sense.  Then you look at =
it again, and realize that there's absolutely no identifiable reason why =
it should.  This is a good thing.

Justin is going to talk about the role of taste in the poems of Paul =
Violi


Brian Kim Stefans graduated from Bard College and now lives in Brooklyn. =
 He's probably best known for his web poetry, much of which you can find =
on his awesome website, www.arras.net.  He also has three books out, =
Gulf, Free Space Comix and Angry Penguins.  Brian received a cease and =
desist order from the New York Times for some of his recent online =
work-and who said poetry makes nothing happen? =20
Funny that you should ask-Brian is going to give a talk about W.H. Auden =
that will apparently incorporate John Ashbery and Icelandic sagas-we're =
looking forward to it.



It's gonna be lots of fun, and it's only 5 bucks at the door--bring all =
your friends etc etc

BOASTS AND SHAMES


i am one of the best writers in the world. i am working on an entirely new
mode of writing. my writing is the most intense in the world. it is a com-
pletely new direction for political discourse. it will be years before i
am recognized.  long after i am dead my writing will be read. new audien-
ces will discover new ways of reading my work. my work is not recognized
as poetry, fiction, non-fiction, net-art, non-fiction, or codework. i am
not recognized as the last romantic or the first harbinger of the future
of all culture. i will be recognized as all of these. scholars will search
through net archives, print sources, remnants of film, video, recordings,
for the slightest trace of my work. my work will be attributed to others.
there will be academic journals devoted to my work, and reputations will
rise and fall based on competing hypotheses. my works will be searched for
clues of identity, madness, influence, primogeniture. and i am ashamed of
this. i am ashamed for my contemporaries who find me arrogant, crazy,
dismissive, depressive, hysteric, obscene, furious, a nuisance, a pest,
useless, demanding, hyperbolic, obsessive, full of myself, elitist, vile -
a bad writer, a writer with too much writing - a non-writer - a videomaker
with too much video, filmmaker with too much film - an obscene organist, a
manic fake... i am ashamed for myself, who can only plead guilty to these
charges, these horrendous accusations. i am ashamed for our country, which
refuses me the honors i deserve. my work is subject to misunderstanding;
it requires patience that no one has and no one wants to give. i am
ashamed that i will no longer be alive when, in the troubling and far-
distant future, my work is rediscovered, for its insights, genius, range,
and all-encompassing worlds of philosophy, psychology, literature, and
fields not yet discovered. and i am ashamed that i must admit to this
truth, still so early in my career.

Keston Sutherland: A Short Critique of Pacifism

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A SHORT CRITIQUE OF PACIFISM

One benefit of the slow popularization of dialectical understanding is
that fewer and fewer people are naive enough to go on claiming that
living in a democracy means that they are free.  We know that we are
not.  What passes for freedom is, we know only too well, a condition of
relative civil liberation based on and expressed principally through
the free consumption of commodities; the sham forms of political
enfranchisement attendant on that free consumption are possible for us
only because they are impossible for the masses of people who spend
their lives in poverty and misery working to produce the commodities
that we pick and choose.  As popular political understanding becomes
more dialectical, this fact becomes more and more obvious.

Certain consequences of this fact apparently remain less obvious. We no
longer want to be free at the expense of the freedom of others; that
is, we don't want a world in which freedom means one thing for the
superconsumers of the west and another, considerably less appealing,
thing for the proletarianized people of developing industrial and
agricultural states.  And yet many opponents of the present episode in
U.S. imperialism speak as if peace, unlike freedom, meant the same
thing the world over.

Our understanding of peace--and of pacifism, which is a separate
question--seems to fall very short of our understanding of freedom.
The following few remarks are offered in the hope that we might start
to think more dialectically about the opposites of war.

Pacifism is not a political tendency but an ethical tendency.  Its
fundamental proposition is unshakeable: state orchestrated violence,
like other forms of violence, is inherently indefensible since it
creates victims (of suffering, of injury, of murder).  The
indefensibility of state orchestrated violence is not, for pacifism, to
be explained in terms of the specific political character of the state
which orchestrates it, but on abstract ethical grounds.  The effects of
violence are of course not at all abstract, and the repugnance felt by
observers toward the acts which cause those effects is not itself a
merely speculative, abstract form of repugnance.  But the position
taken up in reaction to that feeling of repugnance is nonetheless an
abstraction on ethical grounds from particular instances of violence to
a general and summary pronouncement against them.

We do not need to be immune to that feeling of repugnance to question
how it serves to legitimate an abstract ethical position.  The problem
with pacifism is not that it opposes violence too absolutely or
generally, but on the contrary that it does not oppose violence
generally enough.  The opposite of war in a world whose economy is
dictated by a single capitalist hegemon is not peace, but preparation
for war.  When the U.S. is not at war--or more accurately, when the
U.S. is not massacring the civilians or civilian conscripts of another
state--it is very far from being at peace.  It is merely in a stage of
preparation for war.

The problem is that capitalism itself is the basic structure of
violence which determines not only the character but the necessity of
current military forms of violence.  Everybody knows that the war
against Iraq has geopolitical and strategic objectives whose basic
determining motive is economic, which is to say capitalistic; the
pacifistic response to this is rightly to oppose the war, but on the
wrong grounds.  This war should be opposed not only because it will be
the cause of terrible suffering, but also--and this is in fact the more
important reason for opposing it--because it is the manifest outcome
and effect of terrible suffering.  It is the effect of the suffering of
a proletarianized population massed across Africa and Asia, the
suffering of their daily submission to the capitalistic work process
and the value exploited from them by corporations and western consumers
alike.  It is only through constant, unremitting opposition to this
primary form of violence that we can possibly hope to confront not just
this coming war, but all imperialist war, at its wellspring.

It may be objected that pacifism does not offer any support to
capitalistic violence, and that its opposition to war is in effect even
an indirect opposition to it, since by hindering the drive of
imperialism into new areas of economic exploitation it effectively
hinders the total development of that exploitation.  Theoretically this
is true.  But in practice the effect of pacifism is to provide the
governments of belligerent states with a form of public criticism which
they can easily handle, and on which they might even to some extent
rely, since the public argument becomes focused on a single polarity of
opinion over whether war should or should not happen.  War, the
pacifists say, is inherently unjust; set against this absolute refusal,
the government's counter-arguments will always appear more specific,
more pragmatic, more engaged with the particularities of the present
crisis, and more canny in their recognition of the bankruptcies of
idealism.

What is urgently needed is a form of opposition to the basic violence
of capitalism.  The upshot of this would be clear.  No government of
the U.S. or Britain could claim merely to be responding to an unwanted
crisis when their citizens know that they are just the stewards and
administrative bureaucrats of an economic system which perpetually
enforces a state of crisis.  What is urgently needed is popular
understanding of the fact that war is caused not by "hawks", deviants,
bigots and imbeciles like George Bush, but by the logic of capitalism
itself.  For as long as the world's economy is run by capitalism, there
will continue to be massacres of the kind we are about to witness on
our TV sets.  Voting out George Bush will not change this; the whole
sickening farce of democratic elections in the U.S. is first and
foremost the propaganda-means of capitalists to ensure that their
labour force remains compliant through believing that it is
meaningfully involved in the running of its country.  A change of
president will achieve very little. A change of economic structure
would completely radicalize social relations across the entire planet.
It is a matter of choosing one purveyor of injustice over another, on
the one hand, or of radically transforming the meaning of justice
itself, on the other.  There can be no question which of these aims
deserves our commitment and solidarity.

Pacifism is itself a dialectical problem.  It is a genuine force for
good, insofar as it generates popular resistance to the growth of
imperialism during moments of military crisis.  But it is a regressive
ideology insofar as it champions a peace which is really the
preparation for war.  The peace which will come following the massacre
of Iraq's civilians and civilian conscripts is the same peace which led
up to it: the non-disturbance of the capitalist economy in its
inexorable growth toward its next imperialist crisis.  This is
absolutely not a peace worth defending, no matter how much we justly
prefer it to outright war.  It is the basic violence of exploitation
run riot across the world, unstoppable except by mass resistance in
solidarity with its most miserable and perpetual victims: the
proletarianized people who make our commodities and who suffer the
effects of U.S. policy more powerfully and fully than any American,
despite never having the opportunity to elect that policy's
administrators.

Pacifism will not only fail to prevent this war.  It will not only
provide the executors of war with a form of opposition beside which
they appear pragmatic, businesslike and well adjusted to reality.  Most
damagingly of all, it will allow the great spirit of resistance and
solidarity that now distinguishes the millions of people who oppose war
to dwindle and dissipate as soon as it becomes evident that the war is
indeed going to happen despite pacifistic opposition to it; or if not
at that early point, then later, when the war is finished.

What is urgently needed is a form of opposition and solidarity based on
the popular recognition that as long as capitalism prevails, the war is
never finished.

The Death of the Oil Economy
by Ted Trainer

From Earth Island Journal, Spring 1997

Australia - A new report on world oil resources, World Oil Supply 1930-2050
(Campbell and Laherre, Petroconsultants Pty. Ltd., 1995), concludes that th=
e
planet's oil supplies will be exhausted much sooner than previously thought=
.

The report, written for oil industry insiders and priced at $32,000 per
copy, concludes that world oil production and supply probably will peak as
soon as the year 2000 and will decline to half the peak level by 2025. Larg=
e
and permanent increases in oil prices are predicted after the year 2000.

Industry experts assumed in the past that oil resources would last 50 years=
,
based on calculations that simply divided estimated reserves by the present
annual use. But this method of prediction failed to account for an increase
in Third World oil use.

If everyone on Earth were to consume petroleum at the per capita rate of
industrialized countries, it would require a fivefold increase in current
oil production to meet the demand. If, by 2060, the world's population
reaches the expected 11 billion mark and all were to consume as much energy
as the average Australian does now, annual worldwide oil production would
need to be increased about 30 times.

It seems that the oil companies and oil exporting countries have been
fibbing. It is in their interest to state that remaining resources are in
good shape, because their business agreements limit them to pumping and
selling a proportion of their remaining resources. In fact, the rate of oil
discovery is falling sharply. The world consumes 23 billion barrels a year,
but the oil industry finds only 7 billion barrels a year.

Economists argue that scarcity will result in price increases, making it
more profitable to access poorer deposits. That seems plausible only if one
thinks only about dollar costs. The fact is, as an oil field ages,
increasing amounts of energy must be exerted to pump the oil out. The cost
of this energy must be subtracted from the total value of the energy in the
oil retrieved. According to a 1992 study, these two curves actually will
intersect around the year 2005. Beyond that point, the energy required to
find and extract a barrel of oil will exceed the energy contained in the
barrel.=20

There is reason to believe that the oil industry is well aware of oil field
depletion. No new supertankers have been built for 20 years, while interest
in squeezing oil from shale deposits seems to be growing.

What, then, is the solution to our acute energy problem? There isn't one.

Natural gas resources are about as limited as petroleum and gas use recentl=
y
has been growing at a rate of 9 percent per year.

Relying on nuclear energy to provide 11 billion people with First World
living standards would require a system of 250,000 giant breeder reactors
using around 1 million tons of plutonium.

The tremendous amount of energy necessary to build fusion reactors (if they
ever could work on a commercial scale) would guarantee a far worse
greenhouse problem than what we face already. Even then, fusion power could
supply perhaps only 2030 years of energy for an affluent 11 billion people.

There is no question that we should convert to renewable energy sources as
quickly as possible, but even "clean" energy is not capable of bringing the
Western world's energy-intense way of life to all people.

Beyond 2005, the energy required to find and extract a barrel of oil will
exceed the energy contained in the barrel.

There is not enough plant matter to fuel the world's transport fleet. To
supply 11 billion people with the number of cars used by people in rich
countries would demand 10 times as much fuel as used today. Because the win=
d
does not blow all the time, wind-energy never will be able to contribute
more than 5-30 percent of the world's present electricity demand.

And a popular proposal to meet Northern Europe's winter energy demands by
utilizing solar collectors in the Sahara desert fails to acknowledge that
about 95 percent of the collected energy would be lost in transmission and
conversion.=20

A person living in a First World city requires the equivalent of about 4.5
hectares (11.1 acres) of productive land for food, water, housing and goods
(as well as carbon sinks to soak up the carbon dioxide produced by their
energy use). Applying this "ecological footprint" standard to Australia
shows that Sydney needs an area of productive land 35 times as big as the
city to sustain itself. For 11 billion people to live like people in Sydney=
,
we'd need about 50 billion hectares (124 billion acres) of productive
land=8Baround six times all the productive land on the planet.

By the year 2060, if the world maintained a mere 3 percent annual economic
growth rate and all the world's people were to benefit equally, world
economic output would have to increase to 80 times its current rate.

These limits-to-growth themes have been debated in academic circles for mor=
e
than 30 years, but they almost never appear in the mass media.

We must almost entirely scrap the prevailing model of a competitive, growth
economy and adopt materially simple economies that stress cooperation and
participatory control. Above all, we must move to a steady-state or
zero-growth economy. There is now a global ecovillage movement pioneering
the development of new settlements that are required for sustainability.
Hopefully, the coming "mother of all oil shocks" finally will get all this
on the public agenda.

Economy. Adapted from Real WORLD, 91 Nuns Moor Road, Newcastle upon Tyne,

February 23, 2003
Interview by REGAN GOOD






Q As the poet laureate of the United States, I assume that
you were invited to the White House symposium on poetry
that was canceled recently once some poets began planning
to use the event to protest war in Iraq.

Yes, I was. I would have gone if it had been held, to see
what was going to happen. Politicizing the event has
resulted in its cancellation and perhaps the end of
literary events at the White House.

Could it really have that effect?

I don't know. I've
always tried to keep the West and East Wings separate. I
think the loss in this particular case was the opportunity
to look at Whitman and Dickinson. In the middle of both of
their lives occurred the central trauma of our country, the
Civil War. And Whitman more or less jumped into action. He
served as a volunteer nurse and wrote a poem, ''Vigil
Strange I Kept on the Field One Night,'' where he holds the
body of a dead boy and buries him. Whereas Emily Dickinson
just stuck to her knitting, and her knitting just happened
to do with immortality and death and the grave. It is a
wonderful demonstration of the choice that poets have, to
deal with the world around them in whatever way they think
best.

So what sort of interaction have you had with Laura Bush's
literacy program?

Well, none, really. I get invited to her book festival
events. I have my Poetry 180 project, which I've made my
main project. We encourage high schools, because that's
really where for most people poetry dies off and gets
buried under other adolescent pursuits.

What kind of authors have been at the book festival
affairs?

Kinky Friedman comes to mind. He's one of theirs -- you
know, a Texan. And Mary Higgins Clark. You know, popular
authors, really.

We've had an actor as a president -- do you think we'll
ever have a poet as a president?

Now there's a long shot. I think we'll definitely have a
woman before a poet -- I mean, I don't think Gene McCarthy
won any points when the public found out he wrote poetry.
No, the public is probably more suspicious of poets than
women, and maybe for good reason.

So much for Shelley's declaration that poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the world.

It's a delusion of grandeur. One of the ridiculous aspects
of being a poet is the huge gulf between how seriously we
take ourselves and how generally we are ignored by
everybody else.

What was the last poem that really spoke to, or was
embraced by, the American people?

I can't think of an antiwar poem that has spoken to the
American people. There is one poem that has spoken to the
American people, and that is ''Stopping by Woods on a Snowy
Evening.'' That is the most popular poem in America. It was
either that or ''The Road Not Taken'' that John F. Kennedy
carried with him in his wallet on a piece of paper.

Do you imagine that President Bush reads much poetry?

I
don't know what he reads. I hope he's not reading too much
of it -- he should be busy doing other things, like running
the country and maybe even keeping us out of war. I
remember that when I read before Congress, someone
commented that Dick Cheney on the CNN feed didn't appear to
be paying a great deal of attention to my poem. I said:
''Well, I really wouldn't want him to. I would rather he
concentrated on the affairs of state.''

If you could hand Bush or Cheney a poem right now, what
would it be?

The poets who have written the best poems about war seem to
be the poets whose countries have experienced an invasion
or vicious dictatorships. Poets like Vaclav Havel, and
Mandelstam and Akhmatova from Russia, and from Poland,
Milosz, and the poet whom I am centering on, Wislawa
Szymborska, a Nobel Prize winner. She has a poem, ''The End
and the Beginning,'' that begins: ''After every war/someone
has to clean up./Things won't/straighten themselves up,
after all./Someone has to push the rubble/to the side of
the road,/so the corpse-filled wagons/can pass.'' I would
probably stand at the White House and hand out this poem.

"Whereas Emily Dickinson

(which of course has nothing to do with the civil war....
or with those who keep the sabbath going to church
or shut one up in prose, etc....

yep, good old unpolitical status-quo supporting emily

For what it's worth, James Earl Carter is a published poet, and a darn sight
better at it than E. McCarthy. (Not saying much) As well, Lincoln wrote some
verse as well.

Yes, Mr. Collins: women and poets are two totally different things. But do
you think a poet could get elected if she were a woman, and wrote her
poems in such total secrecy as to make Emily Dickinson look like a town
crier by comparison?

I mean, I'll shut up about the poetry thing long enough to get through the
campaign if you let me be President.

But all writing is a technical problem, and it seems likely that codes and
laws whether they stem from Bossuet, Coleridge or Perl instigate certain
reflexivities. Morse Peckham (Man's Rage for Chaos) might be useful here;
I'm not sure the learning curve argument goes very far --

interesting.  had this thought last night
"and then you wonder
one day
If
the word is really the way I wrote it?
the word is really the way I write it?
they write it?
we write it?
this pen writes it?
this computer writes it?
this ami,ation program zips it?"

Then I got your message and thought of Lu Chi and brush meditators and
something Dmitri Buatov said about the roots of visual poetry and
Pennebaker's research which might say the how you 'say' actually determines
what you say as in process determines content.

i think aan has done some things along this ine and a lot of people don't
see it.

food for thought,
but for now I'll pick up my train of thought and write my world and wonder
how well off Johnny Paycheck would have died had he not done 'Take This Job
and Shoved It"?

well i've been saying for a long while that the *absence* of a
generation gap (owing perhaps to the demise of a sustainable
working-class middle class, the top .01%, and so forth) is preventing
"youth," by and large, from occupying the more resistant public place
of dissent we customarily associate with "youth"... it's well and
good to protest the war with 60s types whose collective consciousness
is stuck back in the day, or to see former sds rads with their
well-heeled sons & daughters at the latest pop/rock concert... but i
don't think "youth" benefits entirely from this interaction, in the
terms customarily assigned to "youth"... esp. not "youth" whose youth
is hemmed in by play dates and the like...

let's not get into the "youth" issue as it pertains to poets (e.g.)
vs. novelists (e.g.)... assuming we can distinguish the latter (which
(e.g.) the ~ny times book review~ does often w/o thinking---see
today's issue) neither class of language perps has a claim to
premature or senile "greatness"...

now i'm 47, so please, take everything i'm saying with a grain of
salt (or, of course you will)... like vernon, i feel i've had to eat
a helluvalotta shit to get the begrudging respect (if that's what it
is) that i'm currently not getting as a writer---and believe me, i'm
goddamn grateful for this disrespect i'm not getting, as it's not
been paying the bills for the past 15 years or so (judging by my
hard-earned chapter 7 of four years back, albeit kass and i are ahead
right now by, what, $4000)... also, most of the literate beings
(poets incl.) i come across---in my classrooms, and at poetry
readings (etc.)---haven't seen the economic hard times i've seen
(i.e., growing up on public assistance and watching members of one's
family break apart and plunge into the stereotypical under class,
with its stereotypical alcoholism, despair and, of course, premature
death---i am not talking grad school privation, sorry, and it's ok
with me if you too have suffered), so this tends to make me a wee bit
difficult (read "angry"), esp. around my fellow professorial workers,
and occasionally, in these online confines (or textually, as i read
recently in a student paper---a student whom i like very much,
btw---to paraphrase:  "and then the maid came in to clean my room,"
offered w/o irony)... and for that matter, i think the young *can*
learn from the old, and vice versa... but in any case, that there can
be a wisdom that comes with age (even if it ain't necessarily so)...

but alla that said, i think the right and proper response to jim
behrle, given the problematic i've just outlined in brief, is to
further effect said generation gap, above, which (at least according
to sixties scripture, which as you will be sure to note, i heed
herein to some extent) was both the promise and the curse of the
aforementioned decade:

FUCK OFF, jim, and i mean this sincerely---

yrs,

After a while, things become second-nature. If I'm writing a text, I have
all the unix tools at my disposal, and they're now second-nature to me. If
I have to do a 3d-animation, I know Blender well enough to do it pretty
much without thinking, even though the initial learning curve was
relatively steep. Tacit/extended knowledge takes over after a while, and
at that point, one's vocabulary is extended - gerunds, participles, grep,
awk, etc.

Quite literally had a dream last night in which the garment industries in
league with poets in opposition to the advent of war started sewing "poetry"
tags on to pants, shirts, blouses, etc.
Similar to the old - or maybe it still goes on - little red "Levis" tags on
jeans.
I won't spend my Sunday morning deducing all the implications,
possibilities, down and upsides of a populace whether domestically, in
school, work or on the streets with "poetry" as  both an intimate and public
banner -  with "peace" or "anti-war gesture" by implication.

Since Laura B and Sam H have put poetry on the public palate, it's a fresh
time (apparently) to seize the opportunity - wherever the location.

I missed the first Jim Behrle post on this, which seems to have had a
warm reception on the list, but in this second post I find little to rally
around.

I'm wondering first, who these old poets are that are so oppressive,
and just how they are being oppressive. And to whom are they being
so, specifically, oppressive . . . ?

Still, there IS an argument to be made here, actually an argument
Robert Bly made back in 1980 or so in an interview with The Ohio
Review in which he said (I'm going from dim memory here) something
to the effect that young poets MUST attack their elders, to clear a
space for new work. And that the problem with Creative Writing
programs in academia is that they work against this necessary
antagonism by creating an environment of nepotism and aesthetic
repetition.

Is this true? I'm not sure. I look at so many of the first books out there
these days, wonderful poets that are being talked about and read, that
seem utterly unlike the poets who came before. (There are a million
examples here . . . many wonderful first books to choose from: Arielle
Greenberg, Joy Katz, Mark Salerno, Timothy Donnelly  . . . I could go
on!) [In my own specific case it was Michael Heller who chose my
manuscript for publication, a poet I didn't know, but one I had long
admired.]

Some of these books were chosen for publication by, or endorsed by
VERY ESTABLISHED poets (Richard Howard's introduction for the
Donnelly book, as just one example) who seem to me to be doing a
great service for poetry. Since almost all the established poets are
doing this -- from Merwin to Pinsky to Ashbery to Jorie Graham (none
of whom are 80 . . . actually), I'm wondering who Behrle is actually
criticizing here. If not the system itself. And if he's criticizing the
system, why not say so? Why create the strawdog poet to vilify?

Of course I'd LOVE it if these VERY established poets would be
talking about me, but just because they aren't doesn't make me think
old poets are the problem. Maybe there is no problem. Maybe we're all
the problem.

In friendly disagreement, maybe,

>Maybe we're all the problem.

john g, that's really incredibly smart... as my last (ok,
masculinist) post suggests, i *do* believe there's a problem with
poetic practice, and artistic practice in general, in terms of age as
it pertains to class (and no doubt to the entire complex of
structural social realities)---which is why i think in fact jim
behrle is onto something... thing is, class has the effect, for one,
of leveling age differences... here in boulder, i can't tell you how
many old folks i see dressed like teens... and how many teens i see
sporting every affectation of the older millionaire classes (i.e.,
their parents)...

those old folks, they should be slumped over, backs broken with
manual labor, like my grandpa... or they should have fingers the size
of my thumb, like my old man... and those young folks, they should be
hitching a ride to campus and back, or driving junkers, not their
parents' used camry's...

ysee, i have my own inexorable hang-ups...

i think tho that taking aim at "the academy" or "the creative writing
classroom" (or "old poets") misses the mark IF the argument is that
there's nothing we can do to offset the encroaching effects of these,
well, institutions... speaking *as* an academic (who was fired btw
from fortune 500 *as* an engineer, largely for shooting his mouth
off), no doubt one is fighting an uphill battle if one enters the
creative writing classroom, e.g., and makes students conform, from
first to last, with what one thinks is the proper aesthetic... there
are ways to mitigate this, but if you try them, you'll likely end up
holding the stick come tenure time (don't get me started)... there is
no way entirely around power, in OR out of the classroom... it's just
that this latter observation can become an abstract dodge for
actually working with the power you have to change the system for the
better...

in that regard, e.g., when i activate to help a student get into grad
school, i'm both using power exclusively (as those who don't have the
sheer privilege of knowing me (;->) will not have access, by
association, to my power) and using power as it should be used...
we're all at the mercy of the system, of course, and in this regard,
we all ARE the problem (though some are perhaps more the problem than
others!)...

i've been giving a lot of thought of late to particular ethical
quandaries... e.g., and i know this is off-topic, but should, do i
have more respect for (1) the person who's anti-affirmative action,
but who'll stand up in a public place for someone who's being subject
to a racial slur, or (2) the person who's on the left with me, but
who doesn't have the courage of (1)?... i understand this is a sloppy
scenario, as i've described it, and i understand too how testicular
it is at some level... but i've come across the (1)'s and (2)'s more
than once or twice in my life---it's easy to be against the war, in
some sense, it's more difficult to be with your coworker who's
getting canned---which gives me pause, and which forces me to ask
what the proper ethic might be for dealing with our systemic
imperfections, as they butt up against our personal liabilities
(which of course we all have---witness this post of mine)...

christ i'm talky today... anyway, thanx,

later///

Harry Nudel raises some good points but he's a little soft
on the prision-industrial-literary complex. The "beat cop"
often enough acts without direct orders in the harassment
and beating of the lumpen, at least in my town. In fact,
the crisis of police violence in Vancouver is so extreme
that each day over the past month the chief constable has
 appeared at a press conference to explain away this or
that beating of drug users, street people, sex trade
workers, or political dissidents. Check out this report
from the Pivot Legal Society for details of what may well
be going down in your own home town.

Or does the challenge of the tool push the digital writer to take more
risks, open more territory? Dealing with one technical problem all week, I
feel like my mind is somewhat larger from the task. And as this problem
involves representing an image on a page of primarily of text, the text also
matured during the struggle, being more than tangentially involved with the
problem. This is new fieldwork, after all, somewhat different from the one
Williams, or Duncan, were commenting on, created by the typewriter.

There has been a lot of interest in the PDF file of the Poetry Plastique
catalog, from the show Jay Sanders and I curated two years ago. There are a
few copies remaining of the book and Granary will sell them, while they
last, for the original price of $20. For information write to Granary:
info@granarybooks.com.

The Poetry Plastique web site is at:

http://epc.buffalo.edu/features/poetryplastique/

Some browsers may have had a problem with the site, but that should be
fixed now.

I have added a number of images of "With Strings", the word sculpture that
Richard Tuttle and I created for the show:

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The army's relation to the physical wars it occupies has long been a
locus of literary, philosophical, and architectural conversations. =

Soldiers mirror wars and wars mirror soldiers, and each is gendered in
particular ways. Countless generals have addressed links between the
soldier and the war he/she inhabits, employing certain gender
assumptions to characterize war and likewise using war to construct
gender.  Critics since Virginia Woolf have explored the implications of
a =93gun of one's own,=94 dividing space into seemingly irreconcilable
=93feminine,=94 domestic remains and =93masculine,=94 pubic arenas.  This=
 panel
is interested in using established dossiers of gendered soldiers and the
wars they encounter as a point of departure from which to more closely
examine other connections between gender, soldiers, and war.  We
encourage papers that broadly define the terms =93war(s)=94 and =93gender=
ed
war,=94 as well as ink that addresses the ideological agendas that
accompany these discourses on in-line skates. We are also interested in
how gendered prescriptions affect female soldiers recovering within
certain wars, and conversely, how these female soldiers might affect the
gendering of those wars themselves.  Papers might discuss (but are not
limited to) institutional and industrial wars, recreational wars, or
ecological  wars as manifestations of or responses to a gendered
soldier.  In a postmodern era riddled with deconstructivist questions
about the =93white war=94 of the text as well as the infinite scope of th=
e
World Wide Web, we also invite panelists to engage with narrative or
cybertechnological soldiers or wars. =

Hi. Just a reminder that there are performances of Spaced Out coming up=

this week, Thursday and Friday nights, and next week, Saturday night an=
d
Sunday matinee.

It's a fabulous concert, for which I'm thrilled to be doing the music
(a live mix of electronica), and hope you can catch it -- in the new DT=
W
space.
Here's the press release.

DANCE THEATER WORKSHOP
presents
Sally Silvers & Dancers
in Spaced Out (premiere)
 part of DTW?s Carnival series

February 18, 19, 27, 28 and March 8, 2003 at 7pm
March 9, 2003 at 2pm
at DTW?s Bessie Sch=F6nberg Theater (219 West 19th Street, between 7th =
and
8th Avenues); New York City


Dance Theater Workshop presents Sally Silvers & Dancers in the premiere=
 of
Spaced Out, part of DTW?s Carnival series, a three-month rotating sched=
ule
of performing artists. Spaced Out opens February 18 at 7pm and runs
February 19, 27, 28 and March 8 at 7pm.  There is also a Sunday matinee=
 on
March 9 at 2pm. Tickets are $27, $17 for DTW Members, students and seni=
ors.
Tickets may be purchased online at www.dtw.org; tickets and memberships=
 are
available by phone at (212) 924-0077 or at DTW?s Box Office at 219 West=

19th Street.

"Silvers?s strong suit is the ability to convey an exciting emotional
undercurrent beneath a cerebral formal structure? An extraordinary disp=
lay
of shifts in rhythm and movement.  Silver?s performance is quick and fu=
ll
of extremes.  It is the embodiment of feeling."
                              - Anna Kisselgoff, The New York Times

Choreographer Sally Silvers returns to DTW for the third time with a ne=
w
evening-length group dance that sizzles to the beats of global club
culture.  With precision, exuberance and wit, Spaced Out flirts with
impossibility in a valentine to our polyglot cities of the future.
Zigzagging across borders (from a Tijuana picnic, underworld dreamscape=
s,
Bollywood flamboyance and into the unknown) with a staging of nerves an=
d
romance, the work serves up a vivid imaginary urban landscape. In her
refreshingly angular style and out-of-joint inventiveness, Silvers
choreographs a space between an unforeseen future and a layer-cake of t=
he
past.  Silvers?s panoramic bustle of global nightlife features the sexy=
,
defiant, mutant, zany, plush, ornamental, swoony, confrontational,
vulnerable, melancholy, austere, nostalgic, humorous and hybrid.  Space=
d
Out ricochets with an all star cast of nine that includes Jamie Di Mare=
,
Cynthia Fieldus, Amy Lee, Julie Atlas Muz, Mark Robison, Noem=ED Segarr=
a,
Karen Sherman, Silvers and David Thomson with a live electronica sound =
mix
whipped up by Bruce Andrews.  Costumes are by Elizabeth Hope Clancy, li=
ghts
by Philip W. Sandstr=F6m and spatial design by Tokyo-based architect Yu=
mi
Kori.


Sally Silvers, originally from East Tennessee, has been making dances f=
or
20 years in New York City.  She continues her on-going fascination with=
 the
poetic as well as the social meanings of movement,  to offer a
no-holds-barred exploration of movement possibilities that are often
playfully tilted toward the eccentric  and unexpected.  Vulnerability, =
risk
and vernacular fun take the stage. Choreographing with the widest palet=
te
of unconventional movement, the work fashions carefully defined yet
surprising structures for the articulated body. Silvers has taught
composition, improvisation, and repertory, both in the U.S. and abroad,=
 and
her essays, scores and poetry have appeared in journals, literary magaz=
ines
and anthologies.  She has co-directed two experimental dance films:  Li=
ttle
Lieutenant and Mechanics of the Brain.  She has been honored with a Bes=
sie
award in 1993, received five NEA grants as well as awards from the New =
York
Foundation for the Arts, The Guggenheim Foundation, Meet the
Composer/Choreography Project for collaborations with John Zorn and Bru=
ce
Andrews and most recently from the Foundation for Contemporary Performa=
nce
Arts.=

will hardly doubt the breadth and extent of this great beast, nor of the

dreaming, of the boasting of this great beast and its shame upon the shim,
its beasting and its penury, of what else may it be said, to have captured
its essence upon the great shim, of the beast and its shim? replace your
olding onward this great beast with the penurious shim of gentle wood,
neither attack nor defy, this bodie of lovely parts, such is the olding
high and among us with such kindly shim, of this great beast, its
immeasurable breadth and length of this great beast, nor of the yearning
and olding shim olding its calmness and surety in the midst of such great
dreaming, as of the beasting, the boasting of the shimming up of the shim
of cranky wood beneath such beast, its impecuniousness, of such speaking
and writing, to have situated, this great beast, upon its shim.

The poet Jason Nelson did just that.  Worked with the
fashion designer behind Lilytank.   There was a
feature on/by him in Outlet # 3.  I quote:


"After contacting many of the larger mall-chain
companies, I found Pamela Thompson.  Pamela, a few
years out of design school, a few years out of design
school . . . And when I say company, I mean it in the
smallest terms.  Basically, it was just her and her
roommate, . . . We worked together for about a year
and 9 months, until money woes forced her out of the
independent fashon design business.  She now works for
. . . Anna Sui.

Initially, our collaboration process was for her to
give me a brief description of the concept behind each
design grouping, then send me drawings of each design.
 I used the concepts for word choice, and the actual
design for the feel and flow of the words.  Sometimes
she would request that I change a few words, or accent
a different aspect of her work, . . .

She used the poems on various pieces of clothing and a
backpack.  The clothing incorporated the poetry in
small ways: in the lining, or in a metallic strip down
along the hem, or on a pocket . . . an unexpected
surpirse with words that mirror that particular dress,
shirt of pants.  Mostly however she used the poems in
her marketing schemes, such as press kit materials and
mailings.

. . . I feel confident that soon you will see poetry
on the backs of shoe box lids, or on the bottom of
shoes,a nd poetry on clothing labels or repeating over
and over in the lining.

. . . While our initial idea was only to include
poetry, I happened to send her some 'sudden fictions'
and she thought it might be nice to include some short
adventures in her press packets to augment the
existing descriptions of her logo character.  She
would give me a basic premise for each adventure, and
then I'd write from there."


Three of the Nelson/Lilytank fashion accessory poems
printed in Outlet 3:


televox

sensors erase the limitation
trapping  each  mortal event
along the electrostatic


spectroscope

numbered by a succession of gravities
pulled back and stretched
from a small space


savant

she is  confused of metal coils
a machine  asking of fire
the impossible



It would seem that Pamela Thompson's move to Anna
Sui's studio, rather than being the end of the
fashion-poetry campaign, might have been its
beginning.  Sui is very receptive to the unlikely,
from my two degrees of separation contact with her.
My friend the cartoonist (New Yorker, etc.) Paul
Gerrets, a.k.a. Leroy the King of Art,

-- http://www.leroykingofart.com/
http://www.gvfba.com/leroy.htm ---

was doing a series of celebrity shoe drawings.  He'd
draw shoes that tangentially commemorated the name of
some celebrity.  And he sent Anna Sui his Anna Sui
shoe drawings.  Sui responded with open arms, not only
further commissioning him to do regular work for her,
but when she admired the scarf he was wearing and it
turned out to be knitted by his mother, commissioning
his ~mother~ to knit a whole wardrobe of scarves for
her models.  There was a Women's Wear Daily/W cover of
a runway model wearing a scarf by Paul's mother.


The "poetry"/fashion/label aesthetic has, of course,
been put into practice widely, . . . in Japan.  See
the site

http://www.engrish.com

The French Lesson

February 23, 2003
By R=C9GIS DeBRAY


PARIS - In the year 212, Emperor Caracalla granted
citizenship to all free men in the Roman Empire. Emboldened
by that precedent, a friend of mine, a former high French
official, once asked a president of the United States to
treat Europeans as compatriots. It was an agreeable
fantasy; only vassals were wanted.

For the current trans-Atlantic crisis to be defused, the
White House would do well to steer between those extremes
and to treat its European allies as what they are -
citizens of independent states, each with an idiosyncratic
history and geography. That approach would spare us many a
useless bout of hysteria as the Security Council this week
considers Iraq. To each its own geopolitics.

Eight out of 10 Europeans on the street agree with the
French-German position, and the governments of Britain,
Spain, Italy, et al., have cut themselves off from public
opinion. In confronting that awkwardness, the United States
has chosen France as its scapegoat. Not having any training
as a satellite state, unlike the countries of Eastern
Europe, France has assumed the right to judge for itself
(despite a number of elites firmly in the American camp).


The United States, of course, is free to decide that a
cadaverous satrap, kept under close surveillance, affects
its national (and familial) interests. If the American
administration is intent on precipitating the war that is
Osama bin Laden's fondest wish, if it wants to give
fundamentalism, which is currently ebbing, a second chance,
we can say only, so much the worse for you - while
regretting that history's most constant law, the perverse
effect, is not better known to the Pentagon. Provoking
chaos in the name of order, and resentment instead of
gratitude, is something to which all empires are
accustomed. And thus it is that they coast, from military
victory to victory, to their final decline.

"Old Europe," the Europe of Crusades and expeditionary
forces, which long sought by sword and gun to subjugate
Jerusalem, Algiers, Timbuktu and Beijing, has learned to
distinguish between politics and religion. In 1965, one of
its old champions, de Gaulle, loyally warned his American
friends that their B-52's would not be able to do anything
against Vietnamese nationalism - and that to devastate a
country is not the same as winning hearts and minds. Europe
no longer takes its civilization for civilization itself,
no doubt because it is better acquainted with foreign
cultures, notably Islam. Our suburbs, after all, pray to
Allah.

Europe has learned modesty. A civilization that believes
itself capable of making do without other civilizations
tends to be headed toward its doom. To be sure, in
defending its interests a great nation may end up promoting
freedom. Such was the situation with the concentration
camps. It will not be the case for the $15 barrel of crude.



The stakes are spiritual. Europe defends a secular vision
of the world. It does not separate matters of urgency from
long-term considerations. The United States compensates for
its shortsightedness, its tendency to improvise, with an
altogether biblical self-assurance in its transcendent
destiny. Puritan America is hostage to a sacred morality;
it regards itself as the predestined repository of Good,
with a mission to strike down Evil. Trusting in Providence,
it pursues a politics that is at bottom theological and as
old as Pope Gregory VII.

Europe no longer possesses that euphoric arrogance. It is
done mourning the Absolute and conducts its politics . . .
politically. It is past the age of ultimatums,
protectorates at the other end of the planet, and the white
man's burden. Is that the age America is intent on
entering? One can only wish it good luck.

"Old Europe" has already paid the price. It now knows that
the planet is too complex, too definitively plural to
suffer insertion into a monotheistic binary logic: white or
black, good or evil, friend or enemy. When, one wants to
ask, will Washington agree to count to three - and think
not this or that, but this and that? A sober weighing of
threats, without emotional obfuscation, is far more attuned
to our current world, which Balkanizes minds even as it
grows more unified in its implements, than an impatient
divine investiture.

Whence this paradox: the new world of President Bush,
postmodern in its technology, seems premodern in its
values. In its principles of action, America is two or
three centuries behind "old Europe." Since our countries
did not enter history at the same time, the gap should not
surprise us. But as to which of the two worlds, the secular
or the fundamentalist, is the more archaic, it is surely
not the one that Donald Rumsfeld had in mind.

Mitterrand of France, is editor of Cahiers de Mediologie

Prevailed.'' This was translated from the French by Jeffrey

2.
When Democracy arrives, you best

Subject:      Dream: Feed/Field.
Comments: cc: WRYTING-L@listserv.utoronto.ca

Dream: Feed/Field. (Cantilever against Normalization)


They do tell me things have degraded. This is part of the chorus that
coninually surrounds me. I call it the feed. The feed as opposed to the
field.
The field often synchs to the feed, and very often they begin to
resonate, or let us say communicate, and actually we all know there are
quantum entanglements. Yes, these stairs are composed of "rough music".
Not the rough music of 18th century french printing apprentices making
their satirical in-house performances, their "copies", but lets say the
interpretive outlines of thought itself. So apparently there was a
desert to cross. There aren't many details about how the desert was
crossed, but we know that it was crossed because here are the stairs.
And now is where we first determine there is a cultural subtext,
because there is a nexus of symbolic materiality inherent in the
stairs, and precisely it is a tunnel penetrating a sheer rock face at
the end of a vast desert. The stairs are of carved cinnabar, mercury
sulfide, and seem to present a text which proceeds stair by stair into
the blackness.
We don't know if the stairs go up or down, but we know it must be one
or the other.

The text of the 183 stairs is as such:

This is a hole in the world. If you enter these stairs, you will not
come back to this spot (spot) ever. You may find either great power or
loss, or you may in fact become quite mad. You may die. You may be
transformed into another. You may be trapped. You may learn why you
entered the desert. You may encounter desire. You might begin to dream.
You may wake up. You may re-enter the sleep of days. You may see the
woman. You may see what you take to be corpses. You will certainly find
the dragon.

The words on the stairs are not in English, and they are not in
Chinese, but are in a language resembling very much Chinese, and in
fact this is the field, so consult the feed to determine how exactly
the language might look, and how it is that it has come to be
translated here for you.

Each cinnabar step is crossed and at the end of the tunnel, which is
much too dark for reading, you step out onto a platform which is
situated
mid-crag in a huge and rocky valley. There is a sandy path leading down
to it. A final detail: you are now naked.

What is it? Its hard to say exactly what it is. Let's start by saying
that its a building. Let's also say, that no amount of explanation can
really determine the reason for its existence.

The simplest way to explain the building is to replay the memories of
the feed on the existence of the building.
The building must be a kind of archive, or perhaps a temple. It may in
fact represent a kind of computer or intelligence.
The building at first appears to be a "log cabin" in the shape of a
dragon which splays itself down the rocky valley walls towards the
river. The "logs"
are made of carved cinnabar, and are really elaborate coffins or
perhaps stasis machines. Inside each "coffin-log" would seem to be an
extremely ancient
human being, which can be seen through a small amber viewing window.
Each being appears to be naked but is completely wrapped in their own
extremely long hair which in some cases grows soley from the head, but
sometimes from the face as well and is quite white, or quite bright
(ambertone). The flesh still appears to be fresh, though softly
wrinkled. The head of the dragon is some ways down the cliff, and its
long whiskers are themselves staircases which meander the rest of the
way down the rock face to a series of cinnabar platforms poised above
the rushing waters of the river.

Its not that you entered through an anus that is a highly stylized
portal, but more like a dream where you appear inside, and you are
dressed
in a soft cotton ankle-length caftan. You decide to verify the
feed/field and see if in fact there are beings inside these
cinnabar "logs". There are. You find yourself being attracted to a
strong smell of flowering plants. Determined to find some nourishment,
you decide there must be a garden somewhere nearby. As you walk down
the great hallway, you notice a network of glass veins running
throughout the structure, interpenetrating the entire cinnabar "log"
dragon. Inside the veinwork is what appears to be a glowing elixir.
Still, you are too thirsty and hungry to give it much notice, though
the entire field of vision is filled with details of an extraordinary
nature. Finally you discover a portal into an open atrium where there
is a large and perfectly groomed garden (unlike this text/field) with
many species of flowers and fruiting trees and a wonderful fountain of
sparkling water. But soon you notice a kind of "rough music", a wooden
but miniature galloping (a rapid, but uncertain clogging). And then the
wooden chair has you. Its ornately carved arms are really arms and they
restrain you, and it continues to gallop. You pass through hundreds of
galleries and rooms, many of which are filled with people dancing,
laboratories, menageries, libraries, shrines, etc.. The galloping chair
takes you out a small door and you are galloping down one of the
precarious whisker staircases heading for the river. You have been
expelled, and rather rudely. The long flight down the cinnabar
staircase is frightening. When you reach the river, the chair stops. At
that moment a giant nude woman rises from the river. Her skull must be
at least 20 foot tall by itself. Her eyes are like the eyes of snakes,
and her entire body is covered in an elaborate and animated "tattoo".
Part of the tattoo is a replay of your journey through the building.
One part shows you reaching into a pool of water to drink. Another part
shows you reaching for and plucking a fruit. You don't remember any of
those things happening, but perhaps it did. It is what you had
intended. She begins to speak to you in the most beautiful human voice
you have ever heard, in an unknown language, but somehow resembling
Chinese. Her enormous hand comes up out of the water. The chair
releases you. You stand. Four smaller "copies" of the woman leap from
her hand to attack you. They use incredible agility. You are subdued
very quickly. They take you to the original. She smiles at you revealing
large perfect teeth that glow brightly as the sun sets over the rocky
valley. Then she eats you. When you wake up you are dead. You are in
the desert again. You begin to walk. You consult the feed/field.

Author Bios
Michael Gizzi is author of more than 10 books of poetry, including __My
Terza Rima__ (Hard Press, 2001). Bernadette Mayer says of him
"Troubadour-trickster Gizzi is a poetry troublemaker and he's fortunate to
have two golden z's in his name. Interlocking Gizzi is relentlessly learned
about the American idiom and it's delphic and unobscurely elfin to perceive
everything the way we think he does."
Chris Jackson has recently moved home to Boston from Tennessee. He is the
author of the exquisite __Adventures of the Human Doodle__.
Gary Sullivan is the author of How to Proceed in the Arts and, with Nada
Gordon, Swoon. His play, "PPL in a Depot," was recently performed at the
Poets Theater Jamboree in San Francisco. He will direct a new short play--in
part a response to some of the work in Pom2 #3--at the reading.
Dana Ward lives in Cincinnati, where he edits Cy Press. Recent poems
appeared or are forthcoming in Anomaly, Aufgabe, & Torch.
Karen Weiser has a chapbook entitled Eight Positive Trees published by
Pressed Wafer and has had or will soon have poems in Pom2, San Jose Manual
of Style, and Magazine Cypress.

AGAINST SHOCK AND AWE

                                                            for Kerry
Sherin

         We may not have chosen to live inside Dick Cheney’s mind, but
we do.
         Wyoming, I read somewhere, is the safest place in North
America.
         No tornados, no tsunamis, no earthquakes, no monsoons, or
floods. No major airport: no big planes crashing in the sleet.
         But if living in Wyoming is so safe, living inside Dick
Cheney’s mind, though it was formed there, is not safe at all.
         How do you get from Wyoming to Shock and Awe?
         Getting from Love to Hate, that’s easy: Love, Live, Give, Gave,
Gate, Hate.
         Love comes before life, and since newborns don’t survive on
their own, life at the beginning involves giving. It has to: breast
milk, protection, language, diapers made out of whatever, some sort of
attention before you crawl or walk. Everyone living was given some of
that somehow.
         That gets us up to Give. Gave comes next because giving is
tiring. You give and give and what thanks do you get? Nothing. Or worse.
They think they’re entitled; they’re madder than ever; they sulk in
their rooms, they throw rocks.
         So much for giving. The next logical step is to build a gate.
         But gates creak at night, they leak, they break, in fact, gates
concentrate whatever’s on either side, they distill hate.
         Love, Live, Give, Gave, Gate, Hate: Q.E.D.

         But getting from Wyoming to Shock and Awe?
         “Shock and Awe”? That’s the Pentagon’s current battle plan for
Iraq: 300 to 400 cruise missiles the 1st day (more than in all of Desert
Storm), 300 to 400 the next, to demolish water, electricity,
communications, buildings, roads, bridges, infrastructure in general.
“The sheer size of this has never been seen before,” a Pentagon official
told CBS. “There will not be a safe place in Baghdad.” Harlan Ullman
drew a parallel to Hiroshima: the Iraqi people will be “physically,
emotionally and psychologically exhausted”; it will be “like the nuclear
weapons at Hiroshima, not taking days or weeks but minutes.” The point
is “to impose [an] overwhelming level of Shock and Awe, to seize control
of the environment and paralyze or so overload an adversary’s
perceptions and understanding of events that the enemy would be
incapable of resistance.”
         This is Shock and Awe, remember, not Wyoming.
         But it gets hard to tell them apart: overwhelming levels
seizing control, paralyzing perceptions and understanding.
         That works for Wyoming and just about anywhere in the United
States.
         That’s the problem with living inside Dick Cheney’s mind,
whether we’ve chosen to or not.

         What’s the point of Shock and Awe?
         To free the Iraqi people.
         Problem: “No safe place in Baghdad” contradicts “To free the
Iraqi people.”
         Rationale: Since the Iraqi people are enslaved inside Saddam
Hussein’s mind that mind must be destroyed. That means destroying Saddam
Hussein’s body, which means brushing aside Baghdad to find him to free
the Iraqi people trapped inside his mind.
         But dead people are only free in the most limited way. Not much
bang for the buck there.
         Deeper rationale: It’s an adult world. Shock and Awe is adult
political theater for a world audience. To reach an audience that big
you have to project. That’s the point of Shock, the sheer size of which
has never, etc. Otherwise the audience won’t be struck with Awe.
         What’s the point of Awe?
         Awe kills two birds with one stone. For the right Arabs, it
inaugurates democracy, or something, somehow. For the wrong Arabs, Awe
will . . . what? Awe will awe them into submission.
         I can hear Dick Cheney arguing that Awe worked at Hiroshima.
         But Japan was at war with us, and Awe, or at least Instant
Submission, didn’t work outside Japan. The Iraqi people are not only not
at war with us, we’re rescuing them from Saddam Hussein’s mind. And as
for working outside Baghdad? Destroying it will awe al-Qaeda? That’s a
stretch. There are more al-Qaedans in London or Berlin than in Baghdad.
Maybe we should get Berlin first.
         No matter how big you make Shock, you can’t get to Awe.

         Forget it: We’ll never know the exact route from Wyoming to
Shock and Awe.
         But Shock and Awe is already halfway here: Here, Baghdad and
Here, Wyoming. We’re half “physically, emotionally and psychologically
exhausted”; our “perceptions and understanding” are half “overloaded.”
         But even half a mind is enough to do the math: We’re half
capable of resistance.
         The shocks are gigantic, disgusting, but at least they’re not
shocking, once we give up our imaginary safety.
         The other half, Awe with its ersatz religious capital letter,
we can resist.
         The weapons are huge and thoughtless, but they don’t deserve a
shred of awe.
         A small victory, but it’s one weapon destroyed, the one they
always use first.

[The Shock and Awe language comes from web sites found on Google under
“Shock and Awe.”]

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

Constant apprehension of war has the same tendency

"America is a quarter of a billion people totally misinformed and disinformed
by their government. This is tragic but our media is -- I wouldn't even say
corrupt -- it's just beyond telling us anything that the government doesn't
want us to know."

I've started posting my own blog at http://breakfastservedallday.blogspot.com/

It is not so much concerned with poetics, touches on the matter at points. I hope to make something a little lighter, almost parodic of, other arts/lit weblogs.

As soon as I figure out how to add links I will start posting links to anyone's blog or website who cares to have it posted.


"Poetry can be this or it can be that. But it ought not be restricted to being necessarily this or that. Except perhaps for being both delirious and lucid. It seems to me that beyond Surrealism, there is a mysterious something that has yet to be isolated; beyond automatism, there is intent, beyond poetry there is the poem, beyond passive poetry there is deliberate poetry, beyond liberated poetry there is the liberated poet. Try now and then, young poets, my beloved friends, to see that you are not yet really free."  - Robert Desnos

sorry, that doesn't seem to be how it works. if people want to make
useful points about what constitutes reading, i'm all for it, even if
it doesn't specifically address an issue that someone else thought
was the central one.

what kind of moronic sexist blather is this?  this guy is a poet
laureate???  this is the stupidest thing i've ever read in my life
and i've read lots of unbelievably subnormal stuff, but this takes
the cake for sheer driveling and dribbling idiot drivel-garbage
idiocy.  is this peckerwood literate in even the most literal sense?
i am indulging in unmindful speech but i am so glad to be back on
email and then to have to read something like this...makes me damn
glad to be a chick poet who's into cross-stitching and weaving
---i'll have to get a refresher course in knitting, and maybe even
take up cosmetology and modeling if i can afford the time away from
the embroidery hoop...if my nails dry on time i might even send in a
poem to poets against the war to be shuffled into the "lesser known
scribbling horde of housewife poets" category...

Thanks, Jeffrey, for this. Your friend Jason Nelson and the designer do/did
good and smart stuff. Did you look at the Berstein "With Things" piece in
collaboration with Richard Tuttle - somehow a syntactic-spatial connection
with her garment work.
My dream was thinking very simple. Only the word "poetry". Hip people, I was
thinking this morning, would prefer a "poetix" label. More drive.
He said.(o well)

yes, i feel compelled here, like gwyn, maria, others, to register my
disgust with our poet laureate's take on emily dickinson, for
chrissakes...

of course he's spoken out against the war, so---

so what, exactly?... this is what i was getting at in a prior post as
to ethical quandaries... protesting the war, as paramount as it may
be, is making for some strange bedfellows (highest increase in the
protest movement is, i think, right now coming from religious
groups), but in any case i'd want to distance mself from such sexist
diatribes...

i don't want to say, either, that i'm not surprised... i AM
surprised, and disappointed, and i suppose we might see this little
debacle in light of the dangers of marketplace success, and how those
with it often get it w/o having to, well, THINK... in which regard,
don't even get me started on the grammy awards last night...

best,

joe

Right on, Maria.  And furthermore, no biography mentions ED knitting, but
baking.  And NEVER cooking.  Unless our poet laureate mistakes making
(poesis) for baking.  When Billy Collins gave forth his words of wisdom after
9/11 on PBS, he said something akin to, well poetry is about feelings,
emotion, and that's why so many people are turning to it now.  My then-11
year old daughter said, NO, WHAS UP WITH THIS GUY ON RADIO?  HE'S WRONG.
POETRY IS ABOUT THINKING AND LANGUAGE.  I swear on a bible that I never told
her that.

Best, Gloria Frym

Marcella Durand: Tracking George W. Bush: A Not-So-Silent Spring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suppose that based upon his or her own particular fascinations each
individual builds a personal opposition to the projected war upon Iraq
and the current Bush administration. While the Bush administration has
certainly given many of us an extraordinary spectrum of reasons to
oppose it, it was Bush’s own record on the environment, dating back to
his time as the Governor of Texas, that first brought home to me the
very depth of his untrustworthiness. And now that environmental record
serves me as reminder of how unaccountable our president is, not only
to his own citizens, but to the world about him.

A man who so utterly disregards the well-being of his country, from the
human to the animal, and mineral of it, is not a man who can be
entrusted with conducting a war. Because for such a man, war must be
the “natural” way to be—the disruption of systems, the thoughtless
destruction of both human and land. And after war, for such a man,
there must be no point to rebuild: the exterior world, the “other,” is
evidently meaningless.

Before the mock 2000 elections, an in-depth article on Bush appeared in
<i>Vanity Fair</i>. The article detailed how in Texas under Bush toxic
air-borne byproducts had expanded to such a remarkable degree that in
some towns mid-air benzene explosions—in one case, occuring regularly
over a school filled with children—had become alarmingly regular.
Despite letter-writing campaigns by the desperate parents of children
with cancer, with asthma, with other respiratory afflictions caused by
this literally explosive pollution, Bush remained remarkably deaf to
them all. I use the word “remarkably” because usually politicans will
at least give lip service to their constituents, but this at-the-time
elected leader of a state gave absolutely no notice of the physical and
emotional pain of his own fellow Texans.

However, this was just the beginning of it. Through reading various
environmental magazines and news sources, it became apparent to me that
Bush wasn’t just oblivious to environmental problems and that he wasn’t
just supporting business “over” ecology. Instead, he was quite
deliberately acting against anything resembling environmentalism—to a
degree that indicated he must be responding to ecological issues on a
philosophical basis. Many regulations that had been in place for
years—successful regulations, supported by both local environmentalists
<i>and</i> businesses, such as fishing limits and marine protective
measures—were being dismantled or unenforced, to the confusion of all.


The only reason to undermine such regulations across the board, whether
they were economically successful or not, whether they were supported
by the community or not, whether they had to do with air pollution
limits, water rights, logging or habitat protection, had to be
philosophical. While I certainly can’t begin to guess what sort of
philosophical system decrees that the health of the exterior world is
to be not only completely disregarded, but actively exploited, polluted
and, to put it plainly, killed stone-dead, the fact that the president
participates in such a system says to me that he must be a man deaf to
the universe.

So it is doubly, triply, quadrupedly, alarming that this man, so
unaware of life, nature, health, well-being, is drawing lines between
“good” and “evil.” Yet it is logically consistent with his
philosophical beliefs as expressed in his environmental record that he
would be the man to propose war as a first, rather than a last,
resort—that, ignoring the needs and wants of his own populace, he is
the one to most passionately wish to embark on the destruction of
peoples and land, without even bothering to offer a valid, solid
“reason.”

There are plenty of people who choose the satiation of their appetites
over the well-being of others, both human and non-human. However, there
are not so many people who do so on a philosophical basis. Through his
environmental record, the only “others” Bush appears to care about are
the most short-term of short-term businesses, the sort of parasitical
economic activity that rapidly kills the host.

What secrets of future times are hidden in this little word ["social"]
[...].
Karl Grun (mid 1900s)

"Society" is not a valid object of discourse. There is no single underlying
principle fixing -- and hence constituting -- the whole field of
differences.
Ernesto Laclau & Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony & Socialist Strategy (1985)

Just as society doesn't exist, we should formulate the basic materialist
thesis that "the world doesn’t exist" [...].
Slavoj Zizek, Revolution at the Gates (2002)

They're casting their problems on society. And you know, there's no such
thing as society. There are individual men and women, there are families.
And no government can do anything except through people, and people must
look after themselves first. [...] There is no such thing as entitlement,
unless someone has first met an obligation.
Margaret Thatcher (1980s)

In this life
        to die
                has never been hard.

To make new life
        's more difficult
                by far.
Vladimir Mayakovsky, To Sergey Esenin (1926)

[T]here cannot be a situation where the writer creates something that does
not carry its social mark.
Osip Brik, The Social Command (1929)

We understood his [Mayakovsky's] lines about unmarked, "easy" death, and
about the fact that "to make a life is markedly more difficult," and we
realized that, according to this upside-down view of the world, not death
but life "required motivation." [...] [F]or Mayakovsky, life was a marked
category and could be realized only when there was a motivation for it
[...].
Roman Jakobson, The Concept of Mark (1930s, 1980)

Ch. What news?
Cl. Strange ones, and fit for a novation.
Chapman, Revenge of Bussy d'Ambois (1613)

While I feel reluctant to present a defense of Billy Collins, a poet in
whom I'm not really interested, I just want to soberly introduce the
possibility that you're misreading this quotation. I feel compelled to
do so because I hate seeing anyone misrepresented, regardless of
aesthetics or politics. You all seem to be assuming that Collins is
coming down on Dickinson for being a stay-at-home woman poet, as if he
believes that the only poets who matter are those who go off to war when
duty calls. First of all, ask yourselves how likely it is that he
believes this; the fact that you are so flummoxed by his statement might
itself be an indication that you're misunderstanding. I may be wrong
too, but when I first read this it seemed clear to me that the point he
was making was that writing meditative poems about death and immortality
can be a significant act just as politically motivated as nursing
soldiers. Hence his line about "a wonderful demonstration of the choice
that poets have": he means, I think, that both choices are equally
valid. As for the knitting comment, it's obviously metaphoric: the
"knitting" (whether she ever actually knit or not is irrelevant) is her
poetry. He's not only valorizing what she decided to do with her life
but also poking fun at the sexist assumption that women's creative
activities are frivolous pastimes. This seems to me a feminist statement
if anything. No?

Joe --

as a fan of Ms. Jones, I have to get you started on the Grammy
Awards!  (though it would have been nice if they'd given this sort of
attention to Cassandra Wilson about ten years ago)

and didn't you at least enjoy LONDON CALLING?

Seeing Arif Mardin standing between Aretha Franklin and Norah Jones was
worth sitting through the rest of that execrable affair -- spanning four
decades of good "pop" recording -- We may have nothing like the 60s
Atlantic sound to turn to today, but at least NSYNC was there to screw up
somebody else's songs, not to get record of the year!

don't get me started on the jazz category, which has never been anything to
get me started on --

I spent the hour after the Grammy show listening to William Parker's Little
Hughey Orchestra -- a fine antidote to 3 12/ hours of pop --

oh god, two threads, with backchan incl... i don't think i'm up to
it, esp. as i have to run off to catch ~the pianist~ before it
disappears from theaters everywhere in this part of colorado...

ok, as to mr. collins:  corey, you will note that he's separated, in
contemporary terms, "west" (public realm of action) from "east"
(domestic realm of action)... this is perhaps the worst possible way
of "reading" women poets, and is at the very least ignorant of
decades of feminist thought, which has served, one would think, to
disabuse us of these separate realms (esp. given his position as poet
laureate, i'd say it's downright anti-feminist, Big Surprise)...

further, this question of "knitting," as other have observed, speaks
directly to his "east" wing (as he's employed them, two terrible
metaphors for the price of one!)... those two "just"'s all but undo
any sense of agency on women's parts, whereas a poet like whitman
"jumped into action"... so again, at the very least, or most, women
like dickinson could "choose" to do that which the "east wing" poets
are, what, expected to do?...

do we really need to flog this further?... the guy obviously needs to
take women's studies 101 (and apologies for putting it in such
academic terms)... and maybe he'll cough up something a bit more,
shall we say, sensible...

aldon, grammies:  someone just posted me backchan about same, and i
must confess, i missed perhaps the best part (the beginning---simon &
garfunkel, or so i'm told)... ok, so we'll set aside "in agreeance"
and the production problems and the terrible pap coming from the
record execs who'll "do their part" (to paraphrase) as we verge on
war... and, too, the wretched history of the grammies, their
tradition of ignoring much the best stuff out there... i like nora
jones well enough, too, but she's not exactly, to my ear, worthy of
quite this much buzz---not yet anyway... i liked "london calling,"
too, and for that matter, i think the dixie chicks do have the best
country album of the year... and ok, it was fun to see eminem
(again)...

but the entire affair seemed too intent on challenging media reports
re how the greedy music industry is suffering from piracy and the
like... never mind the artists for the moment---i've never felt the
problem was with them exactly (for that matter, neither does big head
todd)... i mean, baby boomers really *should* be pirating like hell,
no?---we've had to buy, what, ~sgt. pepper's~ on vinyl, 8-track,
cassette, half-speed master vinyl, and now $20 cd's (which, according
to neil young, aren't being recorded with the best technology out
there anyway, ergo special issue cd's etc.)...

i guess i mean to say that, despite seeing on stage so many musicians
that i know and love, the entire affair seemed kinda, well, desperate
on the one hand, and smug on the other...

best,

joe

I hadn't had the chance to play back the tape yet, and so hoped "in

Corey, it may be true that "meditative poems about death and immortality
can be a significant act just as politically motivated as nursing
soldiers" but to me the stoopidist thing about Collins' remarks is that he is
*dead* wrong about the kind of writing Dickinson did (in this sense the fact
that she never knit *is* significant since his lack of knowledge on this front
is an extension of his apparent failure to read through her collected poems,
let along the letters.)  Dickinson's poems and letter include commentary and
indeed poetry on most of the significant social issues of her day, Civil War
prominent among them.  Susan Howe argues that "My life had stood a load gun" is
significantly informed by Nat Turner's rebellion. "I'm 'wife'" is a radically
feminist poem and social to its very bones; "The Bible is an antique volume"
etc etc etc.  Collins neglects *all* of this.  -m.

This is more or less the way I read it, too. I had never heard of
this Collins guy before a couple months ago, and so do not know his
poetry and manner of thinking. But it did seem to me that he was
essaying a metaphor that said that a stay-at-home poet can make
valuable work in favour of what is good or noble or great. This way
does Collins contradict his brainless denia;l of Shelley's position.

Corey reads this passage just about exactly as I do, and in
fact I was about to rush to the defense of poor Billy
myself, when it struck me that his statement in its
larger context is almost certainly a rhetorical ploy
designed to defend Collins himself against charges of being
apolitical or insufficiently committed. He bemoans the
cancellation of Laura Bush's event and worries that this
may be the end of literary tea parties at the White House.
He defends her for wanting to keep the east wing separate
from the west. He then says yes, you can be Whitman and go
to the front, but you can also be Dickinson (read, "me")
and stick to your knitting. The phrase is meant to be
ironic, but its irony is not, ultimately, in reference to
Dickinson -- she's his metaphor for the separation of poet
and state.

Of course this brings up all sorts of OTHER problems -- the
laureate is a public figure, he can't will himself into
domestic anonymity, so instead he creates a fiction in
which Dickinson's (supposedly) elective self-confinement
can be adopted as a heroic pose.

I don't get it. Why would a bunch of poets take to watching a TV show
about teenagers' music?

Very sorry for multiple postings, but the NYC reading starts at 7 PM _not_
6PM.




POM2 Magazine announces two exciting launch reading events for Issue 3!

March 2:
Wordsworth Books, 30 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA, 3 PM
featuring Michael Gizzi, Chris Jackson and possible surprise guest.

March 6:
Teachers and Writers, 5 Union Square West, NYC, 6 PM
(refreshments!) featuring Gary Sullivan, Dana Ward and Karen Weiser.
>
Michael Gizzi is author of more than 10 books of poetry, including
__My Terza Rima__ (Hard Press, 2001).  Bernadette Mayer says of him
"Troubadour-trickster Gizzi is a poetry troublemaker and he's
fortunate to have two golden z's in his name. Interlocking Gizzi is
relentlessly learned about the American idiom and it's delphic and
unobscurely elfin to perceive everything the way we think he does."
>
 Chris Jackson has recently moved home to Boston from Tennessee.  He is
the author of  the exquisite __Adventures of the Human Doodle__.
>
 Gary Sullivan is the author of How to Proceed in the Arts and, with
Nada Gordon, Swoon. His play, "PPL in a Depot," was recently performed
at the Poets Theater Jamboree in San Francisco. He will direct a new
short play--in part a response to some of the work in Pom2  #3--at the
reading.
>
Dana Ward lives in Cincinnati, where he edits Cy Press. Recent poems
appeared or are forthcoming in Anomaly, Aufgabe, & Torch.
>
Karen Weiser has a chapbook entitled Eight Positive Trees published by
Pressed Wafer and has had or will soon have poems in Pom2, San Jose
Manual of Style, and Magazine Cypress.
>
POM2 seeks submissions for Issue 4 through July 1.  Please see
www.pompompress.com for guidelines.

CNN has a headline this hour - no lie - announcing "Fewer Deaths, More
Cremations."

I guess this headline is old fashioned holocaust thinking in practice.
Or certain night clubs.

It's creepy times on Main Street, not to mention the desire/compulsion for
"shock and awe" inside Cheney's Brain
as viewed by Bob Perleman

"The Unknitting Factory" is hard at work.

At least Billy and Emily are at home in rhyme.

"shorter plot lines"?
"a grave situation at the cemetery"?

Speaking of morbid humor-I'd like to throw in a pitch for _Published and
Perished: Memoria, Eulogies & Remembrances of American Writers_, edited by
Steve Gilbar and Dean Stewart. The table of contents alone is worth the
price of admission: Emerson on Thoreau, Tate on Eliot, Morrison on Baldwin,
Cather on Crane...

The Poetry of the TV Banner!

My favorite was a double banner on the first day of major league
baseball after 9/11 on a story about Numb Nuts throwing out the first
pitch:

Top banner for story at hand:   "America's Favorite Pastime"
Lower, "permanent," banner:     "War on Terror"

Sometime the truth can squeak through, even at Fox News.

Kent Johnson: Basra Exceeds Its Object

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Come off it, Tha’lab, you faker, you <i>kadhib</i>,
yes, very funny, but for goodness sake, just
put back those purple bowels in your tummy,
you’ll be late for work!

Make haste, Safia, you little scamp, you pig-tailed <i>qasida</i>,
put that fat flap of scalp back on your crown,
now’s not the hour for teenage pranks,
it’s time to go to school!

Ah, quit moaning Miss Al-Sayab, you <i>muwashshara</i>,
we know that fetus hanging from your bottom is a rubber trick—
we’re not stupid, you know, so cease being crass,
and get ye to market!

Cut the crap, Nizar, you <i>iltizam</i>,
pick that torso up and put it back on your dancing spine—
we know that old box and mirror trick,
now get thee to prayers!

Hey, Rashid, you <i>al-nahda</i>,
we know you love the special effects of Hollywood movies,
but it’s not safe to make yourself into a geyser of fire—
and anyway, you’re supposed to be accompanying the inspectors!

Say there, little Samih, you <i>shirnur</i>,
six-month-olds aren’t supposed to be able to fly—
so get down from those power lines and gather
your legs and head on the ground here, you naughty child!

Listen, Tawfiq, you <i>tafila</i>,
OK, so you’re a sorry-assed academic with a Ba’ath mustache,
but put your brains back into your head, you can’t fool us by calling
in sick—
it’s time for class and your students are ablaze!

Yo bro, my main-man Bashad, you <i>tardiyyat</i>,
you’re as if dead and white as marble, but there’s not a scratch on
your body—
quit fucking around, the mosque is rubble,
make the siren light flash and spin on your ambulance!

Greetings Ahmad, you <i>badi-kamriyyat</i>,
put your face back on and also that water pipe hose thing back into
your belly—
you’ve been a joker since you were five,
but now you’re a father, so pick up that basket of combs and gum!

Good morning, Mrs. al-Jurjani, you <i>madin</i>,
author of four essays on postmodern currents in American poetry,
what are you howling and wailing like that for, hitting your skull
against the flagstones like a mechanical hammer?

A horse is a horse, and if a horse is dead, a horse is dead—
More so, you are naked, which is unbecoming of a lady your age and
standing.
Like Hamlet, your emotion is unconvincing, for it exceeds its object.
Therefore, we beseech you: Put a plug in it.

Could have been stated more simply: Billy wants us to think
that, like Dickinson, he is justified in knitting while
Rome burns. As Maria pointed out to me backchannel, he
invokes Whitman in a suspect way, too. I read it as the
equivalent of "support the troops if not the war."

Did anyone else notice that the name of the interviewer is
"Regan Good"?

I dunno. His poem, "Undressing Emily Dickinson" seems
to confirm some exploitive effort to belittle a
specifically female poet who was brilliant, rather
than sensualizing and celebrating her, or whatever he
wanted people to believe it was about. He taught at my
school (SLC) and even though I never took a class, I
got the sense from others that he had less respect for
female poets, based on several statements he made in
class. This may be off the point, just thoought I'd
add my experience of the man.

Yes, I think that's exactly what he was saying. I don't know if I'd call
it a "rhetorical ploy," which suggests that he's being clever; he's
simply stating the view that the personal can be political too. (Which
of course is not to say that poetry belongs exclusively in the realm of
the former. If Collins or Laura Bush or anyone thinks it does, they're
wrong, of course.)

"Felt things last longer than seen things, says who,
drawing out forks of fire, who walking by, tied for
departure, packaged into powder. Fled ecstasy as a
response like 'brilliant' can mean anything.
Everything appears to shine given enough darkness.
Crushed into brilliance, the bright ball, dished.
Write your poem in the space above, erasing what is
beneath it. Paper covers rock. Listen. It's tough,
hearts get crushed by metal these days, no matter
what."
--from "Drive"

Elizabeth Willis writes a poetry of mystery and power.
In The Human Abstract (Penguin, 1995), she explored
modes of religious, creaturely knowledge through a
prism of poetic fragmentation, ellipsis, and densely
felt moments. Her much-anticipated new book,
Turneresque (Burning Deck, 2003), is in part a
meditation on the semantic interrelations between 19th
century painter J.M.W. Turner and present-day
capitalist mogul Ted Turner. She teaches at Wesleyan
University in Connecticut.

What is so special about On the Cave You Live In
(Flood Editions, 2002), Philip Jenks' first book of
poetry? Jenks has written one of the first great books
of poetry in America in this new century. A stranger,
more necessary set of poems you'd be hard-pressed to
find. Superficially, Jenks appears to have been
schooled in some of the tactics of Language poetry,
but the disjunctions of these lyrics seem less
theorized and much more embodied, as in a spasm or a
psychic hiccup. In his poetry it's rather as if Blake
had read Olson or Hannah Arendt before he started
writing his prophecies: "My mind gleams like the
fangs/ of a viper in white heat/ dying to sink my
teeth into/ the throat of something wrong"

The whole act of contrasting the two irks me-- as it was doubtful that at
that time Dickinson could/would have "gone to the front" anyway. (so many
women were taken into the "fighting!") I know this is obvious, but I needed
to state it.
    You know, harkening back /suggestively/ to articles like Linda Nochlin's
1971 article  "Why Are There No Great Women Artists" pertaining to the
visual arts world, but none the less... she wrote WAY back then:

"Art is not a free autonomous activity of a super-endowed individual,
'influenced' by previous artists and more vaguely and superficially by
'social forces,' but rather...occurs in a social situation, is an integral
element of social structure, and is mediated and determined by specific and
definable social institutions, be they art academies, systems of patronage,
mythologies of the divine creator and artist as he-man or social outcast."

When I read our lariat's interview in the Times today, I didn't hear the
Dickinson analogy as being domestic at all, nor about how the personal
can be political. Rather, I think Mr. Collins was using a corporate
analogy. "Stick to the knitting" is one of the classic (in Harvard
Business Review/Forbes/Wall Street Urinal contexts) tenets of
"excellence," identified literally as such by Tom Peters in his best
seller of about 15 years back, "In Search of Excellence." It means
staying focused on what you are good at -- rather than going off in too
many directions at once (e.g. AOL-Time Warner) or in directions that
having nothing to do with your "skill set" (the way George the First's
pre-CIA oil company a few years back tried to morph from Zapata Oil into
a web developer called Zapped!). What Collins admires about Dickinson
isn't her writing, nor her politics, but rather her marketing
strategy....

Subject: Re: NYTimes.com Article: Versus Verses

Right on, Maria.  And furthermore, no biography
mentions ED knitting, but
baking.  And NEVER cooking.  Unless our poet laureate
mistakes making
(poesis) for baking.  When Billy Collins gave forth
his words of wisdom after
9/11 on PBS, he said something akin to, well poetry is
about feelings,
emotion, and that's why so many people are turning to
it now.  My then-11
year old daughter said, NO, WHAS UP WITH THIS GUY ON
RADIO?  HE'S WRONG.
POETRY IS ABOUT THINKING AND LANGUAGE.  I swear on a
bible that I never told
her that.

Best, Gloria Frym

whoa-ho!  now this is the first generous interpretation that makes
any sense to me because it is based on insider knowledge of corporate
jargon.  but wasn't whitman also "sticking to his knitting" by doing
what he was good at, i.e. chasing young men, this time rendered
helpless in hospital by their wounds? don't get me wrong anyone, i
see nothing terribly wrong with this, but i find it comical that
collins misses the homoerotic impulse behind whitman's heroics.

i don't get it that you dont' get it; obviously he meant principles.
it was not the birthdays of the leading lights he was toasting, but
the principles that made language etc a coherent intervention into
american poetry. bowering, bromige, your brilliance is misleading you
in this case, darlings.  get back in the cage!

Subject:      Report from Turkey
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The Turkish Parliament will vote today on whether to allow 40,000 U.S. =
troops into the country to form a northern attack zone for the proposed =
war against Iraq. From what I hear they're already unloading the boats. =
It's a done deal.

That leaves the U.N. vote. Britain and the U.S. have tabled a new =
resolution, revised since the demonstrations. The only informed =
reporting I could find on this was from The Independent (today's). For =
'intense diplomacy' below read 'coercive tactics' and 'vote buying':

=20

Officials talk of "intense diplomacy" - that to gain the nine votes =
needed from a reluctant Security Council, the gloves are very much off =
and that in some cases efforts are being made to buy votes.

This includes telling countries that with a war against Iraq all but =
inevitable, they would be advised not to find themselves on the wrong =
side of the issue and that the future of important trade agreements =
could hang on their vote.

"It has been firm and pragmatic. The effort has been very much in =
reminding countries of their need to stand by their commitments," said =
one diplomat involved. "I think some of the non-permanent members [of =
the Security Council] are now wishing they had not applied to be =
members." The diplomat added: "[Economic inducements] are a factor. That =
is something that is happening between the capitals rather than at the =
UN. People are quite aware that this is an important vote ... and that =
it is an important part of their relationship with the US."

American displeasure can be crippling; in 1991, when the Security =
Council voted for the Gulf War, a non-permanent member, Yemen, voted =
against. Minutes later, a senior American diplomat told the Yemeni =
ambassador: "That was the most expensive 'No' vote you ever cast." =
Within three days, a US aid programme of $70m to Yemen was stopped.

To be adopted, the resolution requires agreement from at least nine =
members of the Security Council, with none of the five permanent members =
using their veto. If the vote was taken today, the United States and =
Britain could be assured of only two other votes in favour, those of the =
non-permanent members Spain and Bulgaria. In response, diplomats and =
officials have been concentrating on trying to persuade the six "swing" =
non-permanent members of the council - Guinea, Mexico, Pakistan, Angola, =
Cameroon and Chile. Syria and Germany, both non-permanent members, =
remain opposed to a second resolution.

Diplomats have been using a mixture of carrot and stick to get the votes =
they need. Over the weekend President George Bush telephoned Mexico's =
President, Vicente Fox, and Chile's President, Ricardo Lagos. He has =
previously spoken directly to the Pakistani leader, General Pervez =
Musharraf. At the same time, Tony Blair telephoned Russia's President, =
Vladimir Putin, and other council members have received telephone calls =
or visits from senior American officials.

The package to Turkey, in exchange for the right to deploy US troops, =
will include $5bn in aid and $10bn in loans to cushion the Turkish =
economy from the impact of any war. But America is keen to avoid having =
to offer such obvious inducements to other countries, conscious that the =
so-called coalition of the willing could quickly become the coalition of =
the bought.

"We think the case is strong on its merits," one senior administration =
official said. "We're looking to our friends to work with us to confront =
a common danger ... So the question doesn't arise in those terms."

How votes are being marshalled in the Security Council

YES (IN FAVOUR OF SECOND RESOLUTION)

UK (veto-holding); US (veto); Spain; Bulgaria

NO (AGAINST SECOND RESOLUTION)

France (veto); Germany; Russia (veto) Tony Blair calls President =
Vladimir Putin on Sunday; Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar calls =
Mr Putin yesterday

Syria Mr Powell phones the Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Shara

UNDECIDED

China (veto) Mr Powell visit

Guinea Senior US official visit

Mexico President Bush phones and Mr Aznar visits President Vicente Fox. =
Visit by two US officials

Pakistan Mr Bush telephone call

Angola Senior US official visit

THE PRESIDENT: There's a joke going round the Internet right now about
  my library burning down.  (Laughter.) It says all the books in it
were lost
  in the fire (laughter) -- and they were both children's books.
(Laughter.)
  My good nature and confidence in Jesus Christ as my personal savior
allow
  me to laugh at these harmless ribbings. (Laughter and applause.)

  The truth is, I don't read books and don't respect them and have no
respect
  for the people who do.  (Laughter.) They think they're better than
other
  people.  (Laughter.)  Just because someone works hard to know
something
  about the world that can't be got on television doesn't make them
  better.  (Laughter.) If they're so smart why aren't they president?
  (Laughter.)

  It's a tough world today and no amount of reading is going to protect
you
  from it.  (Laughter.)  Look at poetry and what poets in this country
think
  they can do.  (Laughter.)  Poets don't have much to fear by way of
job
  loss. (Laughter.) They never got hired to write poems and no one is
going
  to fire them for writing them wrong. (Laughter.)

  But what does a poet know about the real world? (Laughter.)  I think
we
  could overthrow the Iraqi leader just by dropping anthologies of
awful
  poetry on Baghdad. (Laughter.)  There's no shortage of 'em, no
shortage of
  bad poetry here.  (Laughter.)  How's that for "shock and awe," read
this
  you lousy dictator! (Laughter and applause.)

  But that's why they say poetry don't make nothing happen. (Laughter.)
 The
  trouble with that plan is that it would offend the good tastes of
ordinary
  Iraqi citizens. (Laughter.) That's why it's better simply to rain
missiles
  upon them like nobody's business and scare the holy piss out of
anyone
  armed with anything larger than a pocket knife. (Laughter.) If it
don't
  kill them first, which it probably will. (Laughter and applause.)

  Sure, we're going to end up killing lots of civilians.  (Laughter and

  applause.)  We're going to end up killing lots of women and children.

  (Laughter.)  But that country has been starving and dying from
simple,
  curable things and not having simple things like potable drinking
water for
  more than 12 years now. (Laughter.)  So let's just get this thing out
of
  the way. (Laughter.)  And that will learn them not to mess with the
US!
  (Laughter, hoots and loud applause.)

  So you look at what a poet says and it just is uncredible.
(Laughter.) Like
  the liberals they think we just want oil. (Laughter.)  This ain't
about
  oil, it's about human rights. (Applause.) It's always been about
human
  rights. (Laughter and applause.) We don't want the Iraqi's oil, we
just
  want to help them administer it while the country is rebuilt.
(Laughter.)
  But we don't want the oil for ourselves. ( Laughter.) Maybe we'll
just take
  a handsome fee for helping them out. ( Laughter and applause.)

  The other day Dick Cheney briefed me again on the international
situation.
  He said they have weapons of mass destruction. He said the leader was
a
  dictator. He said the people in the country were horribly oppressed.
He
  said they had a sizable nucular program and they were a positive
threat. I
  said, let's roll. (Laughter.) Let's get in there right now no matter
what
  it takes. (Applause.) He said, hold on Mr. President, I'm talking
about
  North Korea! (Laughter and applause.)

  Now there's a country that might do some damage. (Laughter.) They
might
  give us a real fight! (Laughter.) No, we don't want to fight them.
  (Laughter.) Diplomacy is brass knuckles by other means. (Laughter and

  applause.)

  Now it's no secret that when I campaigned I said the most influential

  philosopher on me is Jesus Christ. (Standing applause.) And I believe
it's
  prayer that helps people, not reading. (Applause.) So I'm going to
share
  this prayer with you that a young child who suffers from many
disadvantages
  sent me. (Laughter.) It comes from the great American poet Sam Twain.

  (Laughter.) And it's what America needs today to see us through this
time
  of challenge:

  "O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with
our
  shells; [Laughter] help us to cover their smiling fields with the
pale
  forms of their patriot dead; [Laughter]  help us to drown the thunder
of
  the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, [Laughter and applause ]
  writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes [Laughter]
with a
  hurricane of fire; [Laughter] help us to wring the hearts of their
  unoffending widows with unavailing grief; [Laughter]  help us to turn
them
  out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the
wastes of
  their desolated land [Laughter] in rags and hunger and thirst, sports
of
  the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in
spirit,
  [Laughter] worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the
grave
  and denied it-for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
  hopes,[Laughter]  blight their lives, protract their bitter
pilgrimage,
  [Laughter] make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears,
stain
  the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! [Laughter and
  applause] We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source
of
  Love, and Who is ever-faithful refuge and friend [Laughter] of all
that are
  sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts," ...but
  especially Americans! Amen. [Laughter and long applause ]

  Now what Mr. Twain don't know the Pentagon understands. ( Laughter.)
Those
  miserable survivors are going to be welcomed into the loving arms of
America.(Laughter.) That's the spirit of your cause, and ours. (
  Laughter.) I thank each of you for all you have contributed. (
Laughter.)
  It will be repaid many times over, in lives of new achievement and
lives of
  new hope.  Thank you, and God bless. (Applause.)

Collins definitely needs something to be sewn shut...
Something has always bothered me - why are
no male poets ever compared to Emily Dickinson,

Subject:      personal political etc...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

corey:  not to nitpick, but let's have a closer look at the clearcut
assertion our laureate makes before he gets started:

>  I don't know. I've
>  always tried to keep the West and East Wings separate.

the idea behind "the personal is the political" was to *collapse* the
"east" and "west"... i.e., that the political as such is too charged,
too diverse to be kept in the "west wing" (which thought you can find
in feminist writings decades before 1970, when that phrase was coined
as such by claudia hanisch)... but of course, collins knows, as
above, what he won't say he actually knows:  that these domains ought
to be kept "separate"---in line with any number of poets who believe
that one's aesthetics have nothing to do with politics, or ideology,
but also entirely gendered... so i see a partial alignment with
dickinson on collins's part (as damian and others have suggested),
but i doubt, if pressed, he would have responded that his work as a
poet ought to be construed as "knitting"...

in short, what he's giving to dickinson with one hand he's taking
away with the other---a ploy that anyone who's looked at the history
of women's writing is pretty familiar with, i daresay... and along
with which, we have as well his conviction (i guess you'd call it)
that many poets share who 'prefer not' to talk ideology (basil
bunting, apropos of another war:  "poetry does not seem to me to have
any business with politics," he writes... "whatever thoughts the war
in vietnam puts into my head, they are not such as could be
well-expressed any kind of verse"... this in a letter to ~poetry~
magazine in sept. 1972)... no, collins' is not a feminist statement,
for christ all mighty... what julie k has posted in is much more to
the point...

i guess i have to leave this one alone now...

ron:  what you're saying is intriguing, but if we had to choose twixt
whitman and dickinson in terms of which poet pursued marketing
strategies more vigorously, well that would have to have been
whitman, no?... i won't bother going into this here, but i'm sure
most folks are aware of whitman's boundless energies for
self-promotion...

apologies if i sound testy, but again, i don't think this is about
misreading, not at all... from where i sit, collins is speaking in a
tried & true code...

best,

joe

As others ( Kimmelman, Foster) have pointed out,
William Bronk's poetry can be compared to E.D.,
especially in economy, it its compression.

sometimes I can tell by the types of decorations they have on the back=20=

        I was so happy after that, I felt like I had done my job for =

Many male poets have been compared to Dickinson. A number of
commentators have noted similarities between Creeley and Dickinson.
Creeley finds a correspondence between Olson and Dickinson in that they
both used "the imagination of themselves in some intensive and extensive
manner" in his "The Girl Next Door" (_Ironwood_ 28).  And I've heard
later Rich compared to Whitman (but I think the comparison is
"overdrawn," as they say).

[NOTE: This webcast was rescheduled--now on March 18.]


                     you are invited to join us as....

                   Kelly Writers House Fellows presents

         a conversation with legendary screenwriter WALTER BERNSTEIN

                             via live webcast

                  10 AM eastern time - Tuesday - March 18


                        Among the most eminent living screenwriters,
                        WALTER BERNSTEIN was first a regular
                        contributor to The New Yorker and wrote for some
                        of early television's finest dramatic shows. He is
                        best known as the writer of films, among them
                        FAIL SAFE, THE MOLLY MAGUIRES, THE MAGNIFICENT
                        SEVEN, and THE FRONT (for which he received an
                        Academy Award nomination). During the
                        anticommunist period, he was blacklisted and
                        could not work openly as a writer. His memoir,
                        INSIDE OUT, is an account of this experience.

Robert Fisk: How The News Will Be Censored In This War

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0225-08.htm">How The News
Will Be Censored In This War</a>

<i>A new CNN system of 'script approval' suggests the Pentagon will
have nothing to worry about</i>

Already, the American press is expressing its approval of the coverage
of American forces which the US military intends to allow its reporters
in the next Gulf war. The boys from CNN, CBS, ABC and The New York
Times will be &quot;embedded&quot; among the US marines and infantry.
The degree of censorship hasn't quite been worked out. But it doesn't
matter how much the Pentagon cuts from the reporters' dispatches. A new
CNN system of &quot;script approval&quot; ï¿? the iniquitous
instruction to reporters that they have to send all their copy to
anonymous officials in Atlanta to ensure it is suitably sanitizedï¿?
suggests that the Pentagon and the Department of State have nothing to
worry about. Nor do the Israelis.

Hmmm.  Sorry to be a skeptic here, but perhaps I'm emboldened by recently
discovering (via Silliman's blog) that I'm not the only poet on the face of
the planet who doesn't get the big attraction to Bronk.  In the case of a
WB-ED connection, I can see it, I guess, except that Bronk is so discursive,
whereas ED is slippery, elliptical, & much quicker, I would say, than
William ever was.  Also, Dickinson is exploding a convention that I see
Bronk as taking as a given, even if he does not exactly hark back to it.

Another male poet whom I've heard compared to Dickinson is Robert Frost.  In
his case, maybe the "corrected" Dickinson was influential, but, for reasons
similar to Bronk, I see the impulse of his work as counter to that of
Dickinson's (to say the least).

The only male poet who comes usefully to my mind in this case is Creeley.
Here again, there are big differences, but RC seems a lot closer to
Dickinson territory, both in the formal baggage & in the kind of
intelligence of the work, than other males I can think of.

I'm sure there are about fifty things I've just said that will cause some of
you to hit the reply button in order to point out, DuCharme doesn't know
what he's talking about, & if he'd just read Fishbait's essay on the
transcendental his thinking would surely be set straight. To those gentle
listmates I can only say, yes, well, indeed.

Now, what female poets are we gonna compare to Whitman?  Stein & Anne
Waldman, both different from each other as they are from old Walt, somehow
leap to mind.


Mark DuCharme


P.S. to Joe: Amazing, isn't it, that such words could drip from the pen of a
poet who himself was once employed in military intelligence (oxymoron
intended).

Ron,

I wonder if you could *ever* post a blog that didn't somehow sound set in
marble and handed down from the clouds.  Yours may be the TIME magazine of
the current gen of weblogs, but it's as soluble, too.  So concerned are you
with owning "the future" or knighting the next king or queen, that your
message becomes a hideous, haughty vapor.  You're smarter and better than
that, man.  C'mon.

HN: I think you shd be more forgiving, especially since your last two
verses--which suggest that you don't want to be a poet under any
circumstances except an irredeemable past--show a touching sympathy
for your own mussed self. I don't say this in defense of Antin (uh),
xxx, or the AAP (which does widespread, beneficial work despite the
calcified poetics of much of its membership)--but at least I don't
have to wade through them everyday to glean more goodies from the
Poetics list. For a model of generosity, think of all the people who
continue to subscribe even if they have to download daily yr
unchanging scowl and simpering fragments of cynicism. Even if Harry
Nudel "there were there is" a poet.... drn.... wanna'd be....

nothing more than a  simple rating of one-thru-ten, telling me what=20

an office that smelled of homeless footprints of those who found it=20
easier to relax their bowels than save them for special occasions. =09

congress and masturbated in richard nixon=92s direction. everything was=20=

taller than three feet and singed. the child in question was shorter=20

only would the child not mention it, but couldn't express the fear that=20=

lay beyond, in the field of distance and height, that offered no entry=20=

point or exit signs.

        this could have been the back of the house where the baby sitter =

         the child in question knew any attempt at naming this tallness =
where=20
the red compaion was lost would recognize the relationship and that=20
would be fruitless. the child in question was also not sure it wanted=20
to know what was behind the gates, having already been visited by=20
demons and ladders that would walk down long silent hallways in the=20
night. the said red companion had vanished behind the wall of the=20
possible. there was nothing for the child in question to do but wait=20
for memory conspiracies and conversation  promises  to reappear.


entry date 2/5/5.391
        somehow time passed as time passes, maybe years, maybe the sun =
never=20
moved, frozen in its own mid-sentence satisfaction.  then without a=20
preview from next week=92s up-coming attractions, the child's supposed=20=

father reappeared, who from birth informed the child to not use the=20
term father, instead to call the father, "the unionist," since the=20
father belonged to the brotherhood of those that toiled and sweated=20
into the disputed hours of the dawn to buy meager beard crumbs and=20
meager black and white television sets sold at the local=20
do-right-for-you-store. with the arrival of the unionist at this grassy=20=

wasteland wonder, slowly melting under the heat, the unionist scanned=20
the area owned and paid for by the toil and sweat into the loathsome=20
hours of the dawn, noticed something missing from the accumulation of=20
accouterments, and with quid pro quo tabulations the unionist realized=20=

with grunting gratification the red companion that had been bought and=20=

paid for, was missing.
          -where=92s the companion  . . . where is the one I asked you =
to name?=20
. . . I  told you  to name it by the time I returned? . . . where is=20
it? . . . show me? . . . show me now?   =09
        with plier hands turning in on the child's shoulders, standing =
in the=20
semi-cool of the lower atmosphere, the child in question who could=20
remember the object, but misplaced the name stood looking at the ground=20=

for the perfect refraction of the sound of the perfect answer -
        -oh. . . I=92ve forgotten that, it has disappeared on its own, =
gone away=20
to a different town. I know where the ladders live and what the demons=20=

do at night. I know what happens behind the walls - what's beyond the=20
gates of disdain

(the child in question didn't really say that, since the child in=20
question had the vocabulary smaller than your local food chain. but the=20=

child in question wanted to say that.)

         the child in question went on to state with certanly that the=20=

companion had a mind of its own and maybe it was refusing to return, or=20=

on the other hand it could have been swallowed by what lay just behind=20=

the field of distance and height. in either case to mention either or=20
both would produce issues which can manifest at night as the death=20
march of demons, walking talking ladders, vengeful union members, and=20
holiday picnics with lost eyes in some mistaken oedipal conformation.=20
still the child in question knew that without a name no one could enter=20=

or mention the land of the field of distance and height again.

        but the unionist continued with militaristic dictates to produce=20=

effects -
        -where is that companion? . . . where is it, you useless? . . . =
it=20
didn=92t just get up and buy a ticket to st. louis . . . you know how to=20=

speak, speak up damnit? . . . you must have done something with it? . .=20=

. speak up, speak up . . . what have you done with it you useless piece=20=

of . . .?

        somehow, the child could hear the mumblings that proceeded from =
above=20
and knew truth was relative, as is the distance to the stars, even when=20=

using simple calculations based on the speed of light, curved space,=20
and so on and so on. as to whereabouts and location, and to the child=20
in question=92s mind, the red companion was lost in the land of the =
field=20
of distance and height. though verbal skills where limited, the thought=20=

process was able to telegraph a message

what is truth to you is a lie to others, and to some a lie maybe the=20
perfection of truth. there seemed to be no lies that were not also=20
truths, and no truths that could not fall off the edge  between you and=20=

me.

        the child continued with a first step dialectic transmissions-

        but where is where, and what could I know of where? I have =
turned over=20
the pinking shears and the tinker toys, and found nothing but a=20
different paradigm and paranoia.

        the unionist knew what a pair of dimes was, but paranoia seemed =
like a=20
song sung by some migrationalist comedy troupe. demands of servitudinal=20=

consequences were brought forth by the unionist with a bellowing=20
harangue perched on a simple rejoinder -
        -I spend laaarge summmsss of money and time to produce a fair =
exchange=20
value for this red companion of yours and still you don't know where it=20=

is . . . your trial and error search is nothing but a girlish smirk and=20=

a courtesy pirouette . . ..

        the child was uncertain of the terms hidden in these multiple =
factors=20
was the possibility that the red companion may been swallowed live and=20=

held captive behind the wall of the unseen in the land of the field of=20=

distance and height.
        -all I can tell you is, one minute it was here, and the next . . =
.=20
gone . . . just gone, just like that . . . maybe it went to find a=20
cooler climate or  . . . maybe it melted into the seams, maybe it=20
wanted to move to a better neighborhood . . . here one minute, than=20
gone. stop. and gone again. stop. just gone.

        the unionist, acting as executioner put on a black hood and =
slapped=20
the child to the ground, where the grass was still cooler and closer to=20=

heaven, where things hadn=92t begun to melt yet. the child tried to =
apply=20
the basic principles of leg and feet usage only to be slapped down to=20
the earth again and again. maybe heaven was closer than the child had=20
ever thought.
        -where is the item I paid for with my life and leftover money =
from=20
toil and sweat into the wee hours of the dawn, after paying union dues=20=

and for side show cinematic relief? show it to me you lying little=20
thief . . . you little liar. I will get you for this, your life isn't =20=

worth the spit you=92re made of.

        lying and thief were new terms, words without position, words =
without=20
definition, but even without knowing, the lexicon produced an effect=20
with its side order of slobbering rage and accents on certain syllables=20=

that tended to label the particularities. the particulars were unknown=20=

- "you, thief" . . . "you, the accused" . . . "you, the liar," the one=20=

that hides things behind the the land of the field of distance and=20
height, you are the one in the distant corner always watching, never=20
saying anything, letting time go by and never saying anything, you are=20=

the one that stood by on the wooded side. I say, you there, don't lie.=20=

you=92re the one that has always been the one.

        when the light finlly lifted over the edge of many other days, =
the=20
child in question searched for options other than, option (a) the=20
splattering unionist. one day presented itself,  with weapons leaning=20
against bare chested bodies that glistened in dripping season, having=20
just returned from somewhere behind another tall forbidden zone, where=20=

bugs crawled though the skin of the deceased -
        -hey you . . . come join us . . . be one of us . . . walk along =
with=20
us . . . we=92ll show you what plato=92s ideal army is truly like . . . =
if=20
you want a career we=92re it, we=92re the future.
        leaning against a wall of an automobile repair shop after a hard =
day=20
of capture and rescue, the soldiers would wait for new recruits to sign=20=

up, rolling up their shirts to reveal beckoning buddha bellies to be=20
rubbed for good luck. for a truly adventurous spirit, an invitational=20
entree into the concord vortex of an oily garage was always present -
-come . . . lay with us in used motor oil . . . we will show you how to=20=

make an engine purr in the dark . . . how to disassemble your weapon,=20
and put it together in a second . . . we will also show you how hit a=20
target a mile away with a weapon of your choice.

        always promising, promising anything and everything.
=09
        we will give you a free lube and rotate your rear end for you. =
we will=20
show you the world from the back of a truck and behind an assassin=92s=20=

sight.
        this was a new advertising scheme put forth by the war =
department that=20
had become an off shoot of the motor vehicle and traffic pattern=20
department, because the war had been canceled, then started and=20
restarted. they told those like honey that there was still a need for=20
preparedness and quick assault forces that could drive deep in to the=20
enemy=92s thought process, and walk onto the flesh of those to be=20
converted.

        the soldiers knew one was born every second and two were killed =
in=20
less time than it takes to say =93swindle.=94 when you=92re alone in the=20=

field with just your buddies, there=92s always a  need of something to=20=

keep your mind occupied.
-we need more young recruits . . . more children to come along for the=20=

ride, more of plato's ideal.
        was the constant chant outside the automobile repair shop, as =
others=20
would chime in, tapping their toes to the beat of the advertising=20
scheme.
-come join us, be one of us today . . . go on long walks, carry guns .=20=

. . it will be your future, it=92s good for god and country.

        honey kept repeating the quote etched in the left and right arms =
by=20
the unionist, "join or die - join or die," a flag, a snake, the=20
national anthem, every time I hear it . . . must I join them, or will I=20=

standing up.


        as with anything, a thing becomes a place and a place begets a =
name=20
and honey would be the name that took the place of the child that never=20=

exsisted.
-honey, come here your ailing mommy needs a special something . . .=20

honey, play dress up with your mommy, touch mommy in that special place.

        honey knew there were other images besides being mommy's pet=20
bedspread, images that were in every newspaper, headlines that promised=20=

salvation from a returning icon from nowhere or norway. a persistant=20
savior that descended to new jersey, it was in every newspaper and=20
spewed out of everyone's mouth.
-what an abomination, what a sin, a crime against humanity, what is it?=20=

or, something like that should never be, whether bought or sold, either=20=

you have it or you don't.
        but honey knew it filled something beyond the land of the field =
of=20
distance and height, beyond the unionist splattering terms of trauma=20
options,  beyond belts and mechanical devices.
         -honey come here your ailing mommy needs a special something . =

        honey volunteered into the future, always on alert, ready to =
serve and=20
defend. there seemed no other choice, no other options. join or die, do=20=

or . . .. only option (b) existed, option (a) become nothing more than=20=

what the unionist was already.

        living in a rusty trailer, in and abandoned trailer park, too =
far=20
south of the mason-dixon line to be remembered, stationed behind a=20
cinder block building with its flashing neon sign- =93girlz, girlz, =
girlz=20
- 25 cents,=94 with twenty five cent booths, and twenty five cent=20
magazines. it felt as comfortable as being knocked to the cool grass on=20=

visiting the informational booth for an historical understanding of  =93a=20=

dog, a horse and two girlz,=94 was a dime and a few gift certificates to=20=

the trailer park is prodigal laundromat that no longer functioned.

-all I have is seventy five cents  . . . can=92t you give me just a few=20=

years, I know every stain on the floor . . . fifty percent of them are=20=

horse says to the dog and how it turns out?
        from behind a counter, behind "slit magazine" an autonomic voice =

from something that never turned off or was never really turned on-
        -get lost kid . . . this is a business . . . I have to make a =

. . . do you think these films grow on trees? and those =93girlz, girlz,=20=

(I=92m not going to tell that kid that the horse and dog come cheap, =

biscuits and a bone, besides, I=92m not about to give away all my trade=20=

secrets.)
        -beat it kid . . . or I=92ll sic the dog and horses on you.

        rejected like a whore ready to debate organizing statistics, I =
was=20
riddled with an unquenchable craving for the ravishing icon that=20
descended from the heavens. I had no other option, but to stand outside=20=

the trailer with no more change and stare at the stars, which were much=20=

taller than the field of distance and height.

Hmmm.  Sorry to be a skeptic here, but perhaps I'm emboldened by =
recently
discovering (via Silliman's blog) that I'm not the only poet on the face =
of
the planet who doesn't get the big attraction to Bronk.  In the case of =
a
WB-ED connection, I can see it, I guess, except that Bronk is so =
discursive,
whereas ED is slippery, elliptical, & much quicker, I would say, than
William ever was.  Also, Dickinson is exploding a convention that I see
Bronk as taking as a given, even if he does not exactly hark back to it.

Another male poet whom I've heard compared to Dickinson is Robert Frost. =
 In
his case, maybe the "corrected" Dickinson was influential, but, for =
reasons
similar to Bronk, I see the impulse of his work as counter to that of
Dickinson's (to say the least).

The only male poet who comes usefully to my mind in this case is =
Creeley.
Here again, there are big differences, but RC seems a lot closer to
Dickinson territory, both in the formal baggage & in the kind of
intelligence of the work, than other males I can think of.

I'm sure there are about fifty things I've just said that will cause =
some of
you to hit the reply button in order to point out, DuCharme doesn't know
what he's talking about, & if he'd just read Fishbait's essay on the
transcendental his thinking would surely be set straight. To those =
gentle
listmates I can only say, yes, well, indeed.

Now, what female poets are we gonna compare to Whitman?  Stein & Anne
Waldman, both different from each other as they are from old Walt, =
somehow
leap to mind.


Mark DuCharme


P.S. to Joe: Amazing, isn't it, that such words could drip from the pen =
of a
poet who himself was once employed in military intelligence (oxymoron
intended).

Composting Whitman's MY COMPOST - Version 2


Some of a sick person; yet behold the mulberry-tree,

I will press my spear of the willow-tree any of its graves,

Out of its tongues,

That appear, the cow, the mare,

Out of what was on its probably every continually rises that have you draw
from my body all over with my plough, It is safest,

I will not touch my plough, I was safest,

It green-wash of the orange-orchards,

The graves,

Out of its tongues,

That all is clean forever,

    That the fruits axis, will not go not see and themselves in the delicate
spear of the where have you to-day, or perhaps I am sure I though probably
every continually putting looks its graves,

    Out of what calm and startles me wheat all is cluster together on their
carcasses?

Those strip the calf is dropt from the well the foul liquid and meat?

I do not calm and patient,

    It gives such leavings from the pastures to meet my flesh to the growths
of herbs, roots, or person; yet behold this is so amorous and juicy,

That was once a catching distemper'd corpses within you to-day, orchard and
meat?

    I do not go now I am deceiv'd,

I will not to lick my naked body to men, and overs the yellow it will none
of the prairies,

The resurrection pierces upward,

    The apple-orchards, grain?

Are they not every mite has once form'd part of animals appears with its of
them at last.

Has it ocurred to anyone else that this whole Iraq mess may just be a
vast diversion to sneak Dana Gioia into the captain's chair at the NEA?
Next he dismantles the East Coast literary establishment and California
takes its rightful place as shining western star.  Here's a tribute to
his great good efforts to make poetry matter.

P.S.  All in good fun, Bugs razzing Fudd.

1.  THE BIRTH OF DANA GIOIA

Under Hawthorne’s smoggy pall
California’s urban sprawl
Pauses in a gaudeamus
For California’s not-yet famous.

“The avant-garde is dying, dead,”
the preternatural infant said.
“Meter, feet and lots of scansion
lead straight up to the Muses’ mansion

But woe to loose free-versifiers
who think to crash Tradition’s choir.
I come with rhymes exact and slant
To save you from their avant-rant!

My yoke is light—sweet formal reins
Shall grace your existential pain
And salve our faithless, grey condition
With balm of massive erudition.”

A silence falls.  He gurgles, claps
And reaches for his mother’s pap.
The freeways roar a lullaby.
A lone jet winks across the sky.

Santa Fe Police Detain Library Patron over Chat-Room Visit

A St. John's College Library visit by a former public defender was abruptly
interrupted February 13 when city police officers arrested him about 9 p.m.
at the computer terminal he was using, handcuffed him, and brought him to
the Santa Fe, New Mexico, police station for questioning by Secret Service
agents from Albuquerque. Andrew J. O'Conner, 40, who was released about
five hours later, said in the February 16 Santa Fe New Mexican, "I'm going
to sue the Secret Service, Santa Fe Police, St. John's, and everybody
involved in this whole thing."

According to O'Connor, the agents accused him of making threatening remarks
about President George W. Bush in an Internet chat room. Admitting he
talked politics face-to-face in the library with a woman who was wearing a
"No war with Iraq" button, O'Connor recalled saying that Bush is "out of
control," but that "I'm allowed to say all that. There is this thing called
freedom of speech." He also speculated that the FBI might have been
observing him because of his one-time involvement in a pro-Palestinian
group in Boulder, Colorado.

Earlier on the same day O'Connor was questioned, officials at St. John's—as
well as at the College of Santa Fe and Santa Fe Community College—issued
warnings to students and faculty that the FBI had been alerted to the
presence of "suspicious" people on campus within the past four weeks.

Concern about threats to individual privacy under the USA Patriot Act has
prompted New Mexico legislators in both houses to propose resolutions
urging state police not to help federal agents infringe on civil rights.
The resolutions also encourage libraries to post prominent signage warning
patrons that their library records are subject to federal scrutiny without
their permission or knowledge.

"Saying high times are over for those who sell pipes and bongs favored by
pot smokers, federal agents raided more than 100 homes and businesses
throughout the nation Drug Enforcement Administration offices in several
states were part of the investigation.

"With the advent of the Internet, the illegal drug paraphernalia industry
has exploded," said Attorney General John Ashcroft in a statement. "Quite
simply, the . . . industry has invaded the homes of families across the
country without their knowledge. This illegal billion-dollar industry will
no longer be ignored by law enforcement." "


Anybody up for getting inside the head - I hesitate to say brain - of
Ashcroft? Note his curiously timely use of the verb "invaded" - in this
case, as different from the US invasion plans for Iraq - as a negative form
of terror.   Totally left to his own devices I am sure this man would "love"
to send dope-pipe vendor terrorists of the American family off to
Quantanamo.   I would think his advisors would have at least paused for a
moment to figure out how much tax loss on a billion dollars will mean to
this already deficit hungry administration and the legions of State and City
governments that are going broke .

Clearly this is all part of a larger Administration political climate to
terrorize and repress individual expression on all levels - in this case
creative pleasure for many, let alone relief from pain for medicinal users.
Calls for a chorus of "Rock of Ages standing still..."    Well - just like
home made Peace Walk banners - I suspect inventive home made pipes will be
back on many a living room table or wherever it may be safely located. (A
memory flash here of a smoky gallon Gallo wine bottle with cork and tubing
circa Berkeley one evening in 1969 while listening to a pipe bomb go off in
the door way of the Bank Of America, one block away.)

Walt W with his reed and Emily D with a cocoa vessel   - I suspect John A is
working on a strategy to go after anti-war poets. I suspect many of us will
be happy to give him - with or sans pipe -  some hot, smoky verses.  This
move is really outrageous.

jim, i've looked at your website...

listen, it's ok with me (and you needn't have "heard of me," either,
to answer your backchan to me publicly, and who cares?) if you want
to go after noted poets or writers that you think are overstepping
their bounds... i've done much the same at times, and have been
slapped down for it, so i get it, i really do... and of course, in
criticizing, we pay homage to criticism (levi-strauss?)...

but here's the thing, jim:  at that site, you suggest that the lack
of response to your post is evidence that people hereabouts fear ron
silliman (right?)... and this just ain't so... i know it's asking a
lot for anyone to actually READ old list material (i'm not joking, as
i find it tedious as hell), but this list is going on, what,10 years
old as a public item (we really ought to celebrate its first decade,
hint hint, come next january, warts and all)... and i don't recall
seeing "jim behrle" during the first five years anyway (and i've been
here since the get-go)...

now please don't jump the gun and suggest that the old (moi) is
castigating the young (i'll use "vous")... i suspect it's one of the
real problems with lists such as this one that folks who've been
around (and around) specific threads get tired of answering the same
objections over and over, and over, and their jadedness plays out as
old/experienced vs. young/inexperienced...

which at times makes me feel, really, that i should unsub from the
list, so as not to get tired, and not to wear down other, newer
subscribers with my jaded opines...

but to be fair, i trust, i think it's not too awful much to ask you,
jim, to be a bit more specific re your gripe with ron, whose blog
strikes me both as eminently useful and insightful and as
occasionally oracular and partial (and ron, i don't care what you
say, john wayne *could* act---others, see poetics archives)... now in
fairness, again, i ought not to write what i've just writ w/o
fleshing it out some---but my point here is not about ron, but about
you, jim, and it's about me (and others on the list, minus 2 1/2
posts) whom you would seem to be coating with a broad brush...

anyway, at the risk of creating an exclusive/inclusive binary, i
really do think it's less fear you're up against, jim, than tedium,
the wear & tear of each and every thread and comment being recycled,
and recycled and recycled, often contentiously so (and yes, something
new does occasionally emerge therefrom, ok then)... which might
explain why so many folks are starting blogs... re which, see the
discussion not long ago pro/con blogs (which we'll probably have to
replay a year from now to accommodate, uhm, glogs)...

best,

joe

Jim:

Anger has its uses, but why not a more substantive
critique? I doubt you're going to convince very many people
that Ron Silliman exercises some kind of poetical hegemony
just by virtue of the fact that he knows a lot of stuff and
likes to write about it on a blog that one can, after all,
take or leave. Frankly, this fuck-your-heroes stuff is
getting creepy -- so much "jackal static," to use your own
phrase.

WITH BEER POURED BY FOREIGNERS TO SEE OUR LUSCIOUS NIPPLES. KILL ALL

Had a longer response all typed up, but alas, it disappeared into
digital oblibvion.

For the most part, I do agree with Jim's view of the poetry world at
large, but considering that Ron Silliman played a large part in
initiating the whole blogging thing to a number of online poets (a
youthful gesture in my mind), I fail to see how he could be funneled so
irrevocably into poetic codgerdom.

I do think that anyone who cares about innovative poetry, or poetry in
general, can see the need for youthful (a quality which doesn't
necessarily exclude elderly folks, last time I checked) and
regenerative efforts to take place, although since I'm under the age of
35, I'm probably biased. In any case, the Ron Sillimans of the world
don't appear to be representatives of the "Enemy"....

I can't seem to post my letter to the Times on the list, which I wrote
before I rejoined you good folks.
Suffice it to say that I also found Billy Collins's interview offensive.
To opine that the US will have a woman president before a poet
president, because the populace finds poets more frightening than
women....
To say that it's grandiose to imagine poets "unacknowledged
legislators"!  As if the word unacknowledged meant its opposite!
To say that Cheney and Bush should NOT read poetry, but attend to the
"affairs of state," and then conclude by saying he'd hand out a
Szymborska anti-war poem at the White House.  Who would read it?  Is
she not a woman?
I've been told he's actually against the war.  But with allies like
him, oo la!

aloha, Susan

slogging blogs is an advance over slogging poetics?
"Invalid option" the computer
announced (snickered, spit out, bellweathered, cajoled underhandedly a soft
lob I could, I thought, wham outa the park but overcut down into the ground)
today via BellSouth (Cricket, Clickit, Verizontally)
the SSI Disability Examiner stated (uttered, actually he saw the irony as
well).

Could be the name for a new school (flock, coterie, collab) of poetry

[but
would have been truer before 9/11 and the latest discovery of the ability to
rejoin (at
least in one sense or maybe even enjoin) the trumpets of war].

War is a real danger or a brief bickering TV flicker.

NEEDS A VISCERAL DIMENSION

  I couldn't agree more Walter K.
Lew. Drn is a mussed, scowling
simpering cynic..in a famous phrase
he is a 'nattering nabob of negativity.'
I myself delete all his postings.
He uses the age old trick of attacking
his po betters to draw attention to
himself. IGNORE him & he's sure to go
away. Yes, yes his poetics is disgracefully
not advanced. He needs programming.

  AS to the other thriller conflict
of the day "f...king yr heroes," why
not go "f..k your auntie heroes." More fun,
less Ky jel....harry..

Maria, I just happened to see your e-note today. I hadn't gone online to
read you; it just so happened that you had posited something that caught my
eye.  It hurts like hell! That will teach me to be less literal-minded. This
just happens to be from an old comade, David Bromige.

Ifbrilliance misled one, Maria, it wouldnt be brilliance. i  have read many
posts by this gent, and never once come across evidence of an intellect that
could concceive of such a pun, nor do his arguments in his defense ring
true. He sounds sniping and gloating, utterly out of tone with the initial,
though incorrect, sentence. I am aware that those of us who have a lot of
papers to read, may incline too much towards the benefit-of-the-doubt
tolerance. But I haven't  had to read a paper for several years.My ear for
tone is no longer blunted. I am glad to see that George's retirement has
improved his own. May I suggest you read the original post once more, and
check what doesn't quite fit its author's claimed intentions? Not, st this
point, that it much matters. Once people choose sides, the moment is
changed, and everyone sounds like a self-serving liar---if only to him or
herself.  Love, David

Jim, I thought your Fuck Your Heroes speech was terrific, and wrote you a
note to tell you so. I thought the debate it sparked on the list was useful.

But now I'm grossed out.

It sounds like you're just throwing an empty tantrum. Who *really* hurt you,
baby? I know Larry Fagin stung you something awful, but the pain will go
away. A lot of poets don't even know who Larry Fagin is. I doubt the
immortality of any poet is riding on old Larry's shoulders. Immortality,
yeah!, isn't that what all the bitching here is about? Who gets remembered?
Who's considered important by the people already considered important?

If you really want to give the finger to your heroes, Jim, don't give them so
much credence.

Hey! Toke on this, Jimmy -- Why don't you write a Fuck Your Peers speech,
too? There's just as much spite, sniping, we're-better-than-you posturing and
other alienating tactics amongst the "young poets"...Do you *really* need
examples?!

You seem threatened by Ron Silliman, why? You don't give any substantive
reasons for attacking him on your This Is Not Ron Silliman's Blog, other than
the fact that he likes to play poetic cartographer -- mapping out his version
of what poetry is, where it's gone, where it's going. Don't we all do that?
Silliman just makes his ideas public.

I'm not defending Silliman. I think he can be quite a tunnel-visioned
asshole. His condescending, arrogant tone is, at times, annoying. I met him
once a few years ago in Philly and told him, to his face, that he's always
reminded me of Darth Vader. But so what? Why do you, Jim Behrle, give him so
much power? I don't. I think he has interesting things to say, sometimes, and
other times no.

He wrote a favorable little review of my chapbook on his blog and in the next
entry basically wrote me off an imitator. But that was cool with me. Silliman
has no sway over my love for poetry.

I don't write poetry with a career in mind. I just love poetry. I read it
everyday and write it when I feel like it -- it's a part of my life. Jim, I
can only make sense of your arguments (taken to this creepy level) in the
context of a career.

Oh my god! That's it. I was wondering who Ron Silliman reminded me of,
but in between his being very very tall, requiring mechanical life
support, and being able to strangle people to death by just thinking at
them... it all fits.

Dear Jim,

I have it from the horse's mouth, you might say, that flaming is not
encouraged on the list.

As you must know, flaming is when you angrily attack someone personally.
Your attacks on Ron qualify for this definition.

I suggest, respectfully, that you try to refrain from this as it could lead
to you being asked to leave the list.

And you would be definitely missed.

Best wishes,
Nick

I posted nothing *angrily* here yesterday.  Can't someone take issue with
Ron Silliman's weblog?  I'm not a fan of the tone or the underlying message
Ron's much too smart not to notice.  What I wrote here constitutes
"flaming?"  Whatever.

Kick me off every list.  Kick over every podium (props to Nada).  This place
has less poets and more Harry Nudels anyway.  Enjoy the view from the
treehouse.

Love
Jim Behrle

Greetings all;

Well it took damn long enough, but it's here. We have completely redesigned
castagraf and we think it looks really damn good if we do say so our damn
selves. Things are much more streamline --and we like to think-- easier to
figure out. There are wonderful new features as well, like the ability to
leave comments for your favorite authors or tell us about things that don't
work or tell the world about some great little site you found clinging like
a barnacle to the creaking pilings of the internet. We think you'll enjoy
it.

And of course, as always, this issue features wonderfully talented people
like...

Joshua Beckman, Michael Calore, Todd Colby, Primoz Cucnik, Catherine Daly,
Noah Gordon, Steve Grubbs, The Instruments, Andrew Morgan, Megan Nadolski,
Travis Nichols, Melissa Piechucki, Gregor Podlogar, and another installment
of the ever-popular Whalebone Essays.


Come by for a visit: http://www.castagraf.com/

Thanks for reading and feel free to forward this to anyone you think might
be interested and maybe a couple people you're pretty sure aren't.

The Poetry Center
presents

Julie Ezelle Patton
& Drew Gardner


Thursday February 27,
7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center,
1187 Franklin (at Geary), San Francisco

New York-based poet-performers Julie Patton and Drew Gardner will appear
together in an evening focused on improvisation fusing poetry and music, on
Thursday March 27, 7:30 pm at the Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin at Geary,
presented by The Poetry Center.  JULIE EZELLE PATTON's writings, surprising
library installations of hand-made and altered books and texts, vocal
recitations, and site-specific performances have been experienced by
excited audiences at festivals, literary venues, exhibition spaces, and in
publications internationally.  As a vocalist she's performed and/or
recorded with innovative jazz-classical composer/pianist Uri Caine,
mastermind turntablist DJ Spooky, and celebrated jazz clarinetist/composer
Don Byron.  Her own group Phonemen-ology recently debuted in New York, and
her third book Do Rag, on and on, is forthcoming from Tender Buttons.  A
native of Cleveland, Ohio, Ms. Patton lives in New York City.

Julie Patton speaks about the relationship between the visual and poetic
arts:

"Perhaps I am primarily a visual artist, extending my early exploration of
sound-sculpture, forever fascinated by the plasticity of words, trajectory
of line, line, line. My early work, was all about line. I used to make huge
three-dimensional drawings that was really my attempt to get sound off the
ground, they were performed into being and, visually speaking, had a lot in
common with writing, calligraphy. The painter who performs painting (Yves
Klein for example) is still a painter, not a performer and had no pretense
to be one, same with John Hejduk, an architect who inscribed architecture
with poetry."  (Interview with Drew Gardner)

Patton, a poetic-sound architect, constructs a world of melodic images:
"the musicians in kinder/ garden/ ope, penned/ by a female conductor."  Her
improvised performances blur the lines separating music, poetry, and visual
presentation, stepping past proprieties surrounding poetry performance and
the conventional 'poetry reading'.

DREW GARDNER's first full-length book Sugar Pill was released this past
year by Krupskaya in San Francisco.  A native of New Jersey, he is a
graduate of Bard College in New York, lived for a time on the West Coast
(San Francisco), and currently lives in Manhattan, where he's active as a
musician--drummer, composer, and vibes player.  He's performed and/or
recorded with master saxophonists John Tchicai, Sonny Simmons (both former
Bay Area presences), astounding trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith, et al., and
he's editor of the poetry magazine Snare.

Gardner asserts a pulsating presence in his book, Sugar Pill: "Missile
silos implode in North Dakota/ copping the absence/ as I shrunk back in
horror at the use I was making of my intelligence..."

In Sugar Pill, Gardner magnifies the percussive moments of existence within
the context of America's political climate:

"the bucket of squirming frogs

the specks of mind caught in amber

okay, this is your last moment on earth...

the unused light bulbs

the interstellar sweating

the belligerent jock crossing the ancient riff

a bound glow of sustained peace

do we get to drink it?

the distance missed on purpose

a blur of sending, weightless refusal, continually learning"

I just couldn't stay away from Poetics!
So here's my contribution to the discussion of Billy Collins's interview
this past weekend: I owe #3 to my friend, Steve Carll.

Susan




To the Editor
New York Times


I would like  to submit some follow-up questions to Billy Collins, the US
poet laureate, who was interviewed by Regan Good on February 23, 2003 in
your magazine.

1.      Who ?politicized? the White House poetry event that was cancelled, Laura
Bush or the poets who wanted to read their poems?  Are Whitman and
Dickinson, who wrote about the Civil War, not political poets?  Is it not
frightening that this premeditated exercise in free speech means ?perhaps
the end of literary events at the White House,? in your words?

2.      What did you mean when you said, ?I think we?ll definitely have a woman
[president] before a poet [president]??  When you continued, ?the public is
probably more suspicious of poets than women, and maybe for good reason??
Are women not poets?

3.      When you say poets suffer ?a delusion of grandeur? by calling
themselves, as did Percy Byssche Shelley, ?unacknowledged legislators of
the world,? were you not aware of the meaning of the word ?unacknowledged??

4.      You say that Vice President Cheney and President Bush should not read
poetry, but rather  ?be busy doing other things, like running the country ?
or concentrating ?on the affairs of state.?  Is not poetry a form of
concentration, one that helps its readers to clarify their ethical
positions?  Could not Cheney and Bush benefit from such concentration?

5.      Given your answer to question 4, why then would you hand out a
Szymborska poem at the White House, a poem that is so explicitly anti-war?
Who would read it?

Dear friends and colleagues:

As Faculty Director of the Kelly Writers House, I will soon lead a team of
Writers House-affiliated writers to hire a new Director.* She or he will
start July 1, 2003. We will accept applications between now and April 1.

The position, and process for applying, are described in detail here:

        http://www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/hire.html

Please feel free to forward the information on that web page to anyone you
think might have an interest in seeing the Writers House through a
successful transition.

         in 1997 and led in that role, and then as our first
         "Director," since that time. She has been nothing short
         of remarkable, as many of you know from working with her

         making the Kelly Writers House so well regarded by members
         of the extended Penn community as well as by writers
         nationally and internationally. After July 1, 2003, she
         will continue to be affiliated with the Writers House as
         a senior advisor, an Associate Fellow of the Center for
         Programs in Contemporary Writing, and an instructor of
         writing seminars.

MARCH 1  - APRIL 5, 2003
Opening Reception Saturday, March 1st, 6 - 8 pm
Conrad Atkinson in conversation with Alfredo Jaar, March 1st, 5 pm

Art and politics mix in work by internationally renowned British artist
Conrad Atkinson.  In the context of two decades of paintings, drawings,
ceramics, textiles, and prints, Atkinson creates visually compelling

his own art among the masterpieces that inspired them.  Ceramic
sculptures of landmines, such as those created at the Courtauld, are
prominently displayed in the windows of White Box and of Ronald Feldman
Fine Arts, SoHo.

Raffle tickets at $50 are offered and the winner will become the
collector of a unique Conrad Atkinson work of art, valued at $3,000.
Raffle tickets for four Land mine ceramic works are available at White
Box.   Winning tickets will be drawn by Tim Rollins on Friday, March
28th at 8 pm at White Box and are tax deductible.

I think you make some good points here Susan, but, at the risk of beating a
dead cow, that everyone keeps mistaking for a horse:

Hamill was NEVER invited to read. He was invited to be part of the audience.

Refusing to allow a member of the audience to climb onto the stage and take
the spotlight hardly qualifies as censorship... Especially when security
issues are a concern. (Heck, U2 didn't let ME onstage--those fascists...)
If Laura Bush wanted to politicize, she would have kept Hamill and other
anti-Bush poets off the guest list, as her advisors suggested.

For what it's worth I thought what Jim wrote was not flaming.  He was
offering a critique of Ron's blog, and so, by extension, of Ron's poetics
(or maybe the way that Ron ~presents~ his poetics), not of Ron as a person.
Now, the ~way~ in which Jim was doing this, I have to say, was pretty
in-your-face.  I think that approach was ill-considered, and I think
Damian's & Joseph's responses pretty much sum up how far this tactic is
going to get Jim.

I assume Jim didn't have permission to forward Nick's e-mail to the list, so
maybe it's unfair to comment on it.  However-- and giving Nick the benefit
of the doubt that his motivation was to try & get Jim to cool down so that
he could STAY on the list-- it's easy to see how Jim might view this as more
"proof" that the older generation is acting in lock-step (though to what
end, I'm not sure).  Perhaps we could all leave such warnings in the capable
hands of our list administrator, who's unenviable job it is to consider
when, and whether, to make them.

A lot of arguments are rationalization built around the reality of an
in-your-gut reaction. It is that reaction that justifies the rest, makes it
resonate. In that respect, we should try more to understand what Jim is
really reacting to. Here is my take.

Ron is a very meticulous and within his frame work of thought fair, even
"open" reader. The difficulty is that, in my view, he never reaches outside,
tries to push beyond these frames. I never saw him in his writing ever doubt,
teeter on the validity of one of his basic poetic assumptions. Jim and a few
other poets (I consider myself one of them) believe in a kind of writing
which has discarded some of those assumptions. Therefore, I understand his
impulse. Instead of other people going to Ron's defence attacking Jim's
manners -or putting the issue as being between young and old -maybe Ron
should try to defend himself why his approach is not narrow, some of his
arguments not tautological.

To give a specific example, a few weeks ago in his blog, Ron introduced the
idea of the unconscious in relation to Rachel duPlassis's work -that it dealt
with, faced the unconscious. I wrote him that a writing which embodied the
uncoscious must embody a process which made mistakes possible, while Ron
claimed that in Rachel's work every word, every effect (including
distortions, puns, etc., etc.) were intentional. To me, Rachel's work may be
dealing with the concept of unconscious impeccably, but does it possess a
visceral feel of it? Ron did answer my note, saying that he did not express
himself clearly; but he went on the next several days to develop his initial
point. My use of the word "mistake" was a challenge to "facing the
unconscious in total control. Ron never picked on the challenge, which was
the sub-text (no tantrum! here!) of my note. My question, as far as he can
see, created no ripples in his argument.

Maybe Ron believes that "the unconscious" is itself a text, that there can be
no "mistakes," therefore outside a text. Therefore, there can be a completely
conscious text facing the unconscious, including mistakes. But he never said
said. If he did, then, one can argue with him pointing to the weaknesses,
limitations, insanities in his argument.

one thing that grabs at me here is our referencing another online form/forum...

my partner just had to order an official copy of her transcript from
her grad institution... that's a (long distance) phone call... they
told her to go to the web (online, via the phone), print off the form
she finds there (print), and fax it (on the phone again)... welcome
to multimedia!...

typically we discuss print poetry here, and sometimes poetry on web
journals, and occasionally other lists, and of late, blogs in terms
of their efficacy (let's say, among other things)... we have
discussions here too, of course, about discussions here... now,
rather suddenly, we're discussing the content *of* blogs... i.e.,
blogs become the textual source (whatever their content), not the
printed book, not what's on this or other lists...

it's perhaps no biggie, but it's an interesting development in
itself, i think, and it follows quite naturally from folks posting
their blog headlines here... ultimately these various interfaces (if
that's what they are) will likely fall back into transparency (i.e.,
if they stick around)... at this point, though, i can't help but
notice how content is manifesting itself in different forms, if not
media, and how we're rather casually absorbing the, what?---
referential diversity...

best,

i used these kinds of poems all the time in writing workshops.
here's a section from a style manual i wrote for high school students.
komninos


poetry is making lists.

some poems are simply lists, lists of single words,
lists of observations, lists of thoughts, lists of feelings
on a particular subject.

step 1:   choose a subject to write about, something you know
                 a lot about.
                 the topic you choose may be football or netball
or
                 some other form of sport, pets, hobbies, your
                 younger brother or sister, school, homework, work,
                 shopping, music, the environment, teachers, parents,
                 the country, the city, holidays, grandparents,
                 smelly socks, in fact you can write a list poem
                 about almost anything, maybe the emotions are good
                 to write about, happiness, sadness,
lonliness,                 jealousy, love, anger.

step 2: write the topic you've chosen at the top of your
                 page and compile a list of single words about
                 that topic,

                 example:
                                 the city is     crowded
                                 the city is     noisy
                                 the city is     buildings
                                 the city is     people
                                 the city is    smelly
                                 the city is    polluted
                                 the city is     concrete
                                 the city is     escalators
                                 the city is     elevators
                                 the city is     neon
                                 the city is     buskers
                                 the city is     shopping
                                 the city is     pinball machines
                                 the city is     fun
                                 the city is     scary
                 just keep adding words to your list until you run
                 out of things to write.

step 3:         now read through your list and find a comment to
                 finish it off, to round it up, to summarise what
                 your feelings are about that topic.

                 example:
                                 "the city's alright i suppose, if you wear
a peg on your nose."


step 4: now you have a list poem, a list of single words
                 about a chosen topic, and a list of different images
                 or pictures of the topic.
                 there are many things we can do with that list
now,
                 but the simplest treatment we can do is to
                 replace the single words in our list with phrases.
                 replace all the single words in your list with
                 phrases.

                 example:
                                 "the city is crowded" can be
replaced                          with,
                                 the city is full of people rushing,
                                             pushing and shoving,
                                 "the city is noisy" can be replaced with,
                                 the city is beeping horns and screeching
                                                brakes and sirens wailing.
                                 you continue down your list using the
                                 chosen topic and the single words to
                                 conjure an image that can be described
                                 in a phrase.
                                 the city is large structures of concrete,
                                                glass and steel reaching high
                                                   into the sky.
                                 the city is a large mass of bodies moving
                                                   like a humungas
crawling                                                        caterpillar.
                                 the city is the smell of hamburgers and
                                                   chips and chinese food.
                                 the city is the stench of motor
car                                                                exhaust
fumes and rotting
                                                rubbish.
                                 the city is grey, lifeless, dull,
cold,
boring concrete.
                                 the city is streams of people swimmimg
                                                   in electronic rivers.
                                 the city is people in boxes
shooting                                       vertically upwards
                                                   at supersonic speeds
                                 the city is flashing coloured lights
                                                   blinking on and off.
                                 the city is wandering minstrels singing
                                                   for their supper.
                                 the city is shop windows, department
                                                   stores, sales and too many
                                                   bags to carry.
                                 the city is video games, flippers and
                                                   tilts, silver balls
and                                                         flashing lights.
                                 the city is having a good time with my
                                                   friends.
                                 the city is derelicts, skinheads, homeboys
                                                   and police.
                                 the city is alright i suppose, if you
wear                                                a peg on your nose.
by replacing the list of single words with phrases, we get a much better
image of what the topic is about, and we can begin to feel what it was like
for the writer.


step 5: now that you have followed the steps to write a
list            poem, it's now time to allow your creativity to take
                 over.
                 you have to decide how it sounds and how it looks
on            the page, you may wish to delete some words, to add
                 other words, to re-arrange words.

                 example:

the city

                         people rushing, pushing and shoving
                         beeping horns and screeching brakes and
                         sirens wailing
                         structures of concrete, glass and steel
                         which reach high into the sky
                         a large mass of bodies moving like
a                           humumgas crawling caterpillar
                         the smell of hamburgers and chips and chinese
                         the main road stench of motor car exhaust fumes
                         the back street stench of rotting rubbish
                         the city.

                         the city so grey and lifeless and dull
and                      boring and concrete
                         yet there are people in this city
                         streams of people swimming in electronic
                         pedestrian rivers
                         people in boxes shooting vertically upwards
                         and downwards
                         at supersonic speeds.
                         flashing coloured lights blinking on and off
                         wandering minstrels singing for their supper
                         shop windows, department stores, sales
                         and too many bags to carry
                         video games, flippers and tilts, silver balls
                         and weird electronic melodies
                         the city is having good times
                         the city is derelicts, skinheads, homeboys,
                         cops and other fearful things
                         this city
                         any city
                         our city
                         my city.

this is a list poem.
you'll agree that the list poem is a very simply written poem that can say
a lot about a particular subject and can see one subject from many
different perspectives.
there are many more variations on how to write a list poem, those exercises
will appear later in the book.



more lists.

list poems are easy and lots of fun to do.
in this chapter you can try at least three more ways of writing lists.


4.1:    lists of similes.

step 1: choose a subject to write a list poem about.
                 the subject could be computers or television or
                 reading or writing or the zoo or the circus or
                 movies or your favourite sport, or it could be
                 colours, or feelings, or the bush, or the beach,
                 or chairs, or shoes, or anything you like.


step 2: write the subject you have chosen on the left
of                your page followed by the word "is" or "are".

                 example:
                 colours are -

step 3: now begin writing single words that you think
of                when you think of that subject.
                 work quickly and do not edit your list, that
is                 write down every word you think of when repeating
                 the subject to yourself, even words you don't
                 think fit.

                 example:

                 colours are - red
                                     blue
                                     yellow
                                     green
                                     purple
                                     black
                                     white
                                     refreshing
                                     exciting
                                     flashing
                                     radiant
                                     sombre
                                     grey
                                     orange
                                     brown
                                     mud
                                     rainbows
                                     eyecatching
                                     everywhere.
                 this list of words on the subject of colours tells a
                 story of it's own, there are a mixture
of               descriptive words and feeling words.
                 the object of this exercise is not to get the most
                 possible words but to find the words you know
and               feel about the subject, some people may only
have               five words in their list, others may have
twenty                five, so don't worry about the quantity of words.
step 4: the next step is to replace all the single words
                 in your list with similes, that is, statements
                 that compare one thing to another.
                 similes usually start with as or like and compare a
                 word to something it looks, tastes, smells,
sounds              or feels like.

                 example:        colours are red could be replaced by the
                                 simile colours are as red as the summer
                                 sky at sunrise,
                                 colours are blue could be replaced by the
                                 simile colours are as blue as the
summer                                sky at midday,  and so you continue down
                                 the list until you have a list of similes.
                 colours are as yellow as the summer sun
                                   as green as slime
                                   as purple as a bruise
                                   as black as depression
                                   as white as a hospital
                                   as refreshing as a rain forest
                                   as exciting as a circus
                                   as flashing as the city neon
                                   as radiant as a light globe
                                   as sombre as a winter's day
                                   as grey as the thunderclouds
                                   as orange as autumn
                                   as brown as dirt
                                   as muddy as winter
                                   rainbows like magic in the
sky                                                                  as
eyecatching as an explosion
                 colours are everywhere.

                 now you have a list of similes, which should say
                 a lot more about your subject than the original list
                 of single words.
                 as well as having a list of images about
your           subject, you have also been able to view
your           subject from many different angles, list poems
are              like verbal sculptures.



step 5: the final step of this exercise is to read
through              your list of similes and decide how it reads and
                 looks best on the page.
                 you have to decide whether you will start each
line             with "colours are", perhaps your poem makes
sense               without having to state each time what it is
you're             talking about.
                 perhaps you want to re-order your list for clarity.
                 you may even decide to reject some similes, or
add              some.






                 example:


                             as red as the summer sky at sunrise,
                             as blue as the sky on a cloudless day
                                   as yellow as the sun
                          as orange as
autumn                                                           as brown
as dirt
                                   as muddy as winter
                                   as grey as the thunderclouds
                                   as lushly green as spring
                                   colours.
                                   all the colours of a rainbow.
                                but colours can also be
                                   as purple as a bruise
                                   as black as depression
                                   as white as a hospital
                                   as refreshing as a rain forest
                                   as exciting as a circus
                                   as flashing as the city neon
                                   as radiant as a light globe
                                   as sombre as a winter's day
                                   as eyecatching as an explosion
                                   colours.
                             colours, everywhere.

we have now constructed lists of single words on particular subjects and
processed these lists to expand the images made by the single words.
the first method in the basic chapter on list poems replaced the single
words with statements.
the second method replaced the single words with similes.
another method would be to replace the single words with metaphors.
metaphors are similar to similes but instead of comparing one thing to
another they actually call one thing something else.
example:
                 colour is sunrise red
                        is clear-sky blue
                        is the sun
                 colour is autumn leaves
                        is the earth, the dirt
                        is a winter's day
                 colour is a tempest
                     is new shoots of growth
                        is the magic of a rainbow
                 colour is a man in the gutter
                     is a drunk at a bar
                        is a motor car accident
                 colour is the smell of a rainforest
                        is the swinging trapeze
                        is the neon lit city
                 colour is the expression of light
                 colour is the lonliness of rain
                 colour is the relief of a tear.
                 colour is.....................
can you think of any other ways to process the list of single words?
4.2:    lists of responses.
another way to write a list poem is to list your responses to a certain
word or statement.

step 1: choose a word or statement to respond to.
                 you can really let yourself go on this type of
                 poem, you can let your imagination run wild.
                 for example, here's some statements you
could           respond to,
                 "if i was the richest person in the world"
                 "if i was the president of the universe"
                 "if i was a famous film star"
                 "if i was in your shoes"
                 "if i was the parent and you were my child"
                 or maybe you could try,
                 "i love it when"
                 "i hate it when"
                 "when i was your age"
                 "without you"
                 "you know you really should"
                 or even these single words,
                 "siiirr?"
                 "miiiss?"
                 "muuum?"
                 "please?"
                 i'm sure you can think of plenty of things
                 to use as your initial statement, statements
                 that generate a variety of responses.

                 here's some more,

                 "it's not my fault that..."
                 "how many times have i told you"
                 "thank you, have a nice day"
                 "it's a great day for...."
                 "if you do that once more..."
                 "johnny don't..."
                 "i should've..."
                 "i would've...."
                 "yesterday i..."
                 "tomorrow i'll..."
                 "in the future"
                 "when i was five"
                 "i remember when.."














step 2: now write your initial word or statement on the
left            hand side of your page and list the responses.




                 example:


                 i could've      read a book
                 i could've      written a few poems
                 i could've      started that painting i've
been                                                 meaning to start
                 i could've      worked on my play
                 i could've      straightened out my finances
                 i could've      played my instrument till my
fingers                                            were sore
                 i could've      sung to my heart's content till
the                                             early hours of the morning
                 i could've      had a conversation with my wife
                 i could've      visited some friends
                 i could've      gone to see a band
                 i could've      caught some theatre or a movie
                 i could've      played some pool, sunk a few pots,
                                                 told a few jokes, had a
few                                             laughs
                 i could've      sipped coffee in some trendy
                                                 little inner suburban
                                                         bourgie cafe
                 i could've      strutted the streets of the neon
                                                 city searching for inspiration
                 i could've      discussed the meaning of life and art
                                                 with a fellow
barstool                                                  philosopher
                 i could've      danced naked in the botanical gardens
                                                 under the nighttime moon
and                                                    stars
                 but,
                 i watched television again
                 till it was time to go to bed.



in this example i listed all the things i could've done instead of watching
television.













4.3:    found lists.
lists poems can also be written by collecting statements that occur in our
daily existence, statements that other people have written that we collect
and re-order to give them a new meaning.
all around us we can find poems, if we look hard enough, and if we know
what we are looking for.
take advertising jingles or slogans for example.
we hear advertising slogans all the time.
"oh. what a feeling", "coke is it", "just like a chocolate milkshake only
crunchy", these are things we hear, and if we collected all the advertising
slogans and ordered them into lists we could tell other stories.

newspaper headlines also are similar things, we could make lists of
headlines that told us something about life or about the writer.

song titles are another category of like statements that can be grouped and
re-grouped to create a story.
"she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"
"i wanna be your man"
"love will keep us together"
"why'd ya do it she said"
"breaking up is hard to do"
"it's over"
"crying"
"nothing compares to you"

the titles of movies, the titles of books, street signs,
you can think of your own categories of like statements.
things different politicians have said, political campaign slogans, the
first lines of different songs or poems.

step 1: select a category of like statements.

step 2: collect as many like statements within that category
                 as you possibly can, don't reject any at this
stage             and don't worry about making sense of the list.

step 3: now that you have all the information start grouping            the
statements together so they begin to tell a                 story.
                 in my example below i got the idea one morning to
                 collect all the statements around me that warned
                 against doing certain things.
                 so i set off to the supermarket with my pad and pen
                 and wrote down all the warnings i found along
the               way.

                 example:

                 warning: smoking reduces your fitness
                 warning: smoking causes heart disease
                 warning: smoking causes lung cancer
                 warning: use by 15/12
                 warning: do not obstruct driver's view of doorway
                 warning: please do not smoke in the interests of

A general letter from George & Lucy Mattingly:

Hello Everyone,

This is just to let you know that we are reprinting "So Going Around
Cities: New & Selected Poems" by Ted Berrigan.

The book will be available by the beginning of April at a list price
of $34.95 (quality paperback). Please pass the word on to friends who
may have always wanted a copy but couldn't find one! And college
professors, too. Class adoptions are always welcome.

The book will be available through Small Press Distribution, Ingram
(which means most bookstores can order it), Baker & Taylor, and
Amazon et al. It will of course be available directly from us, and
soon we will have a website (bluewindpress.com).

So order your copies now for friends and family!

All the best,
Lucy & George

Are you thinking of Kenneth Koch's book, Wishes Lies and Dreams? In it, he
articulates several exercises of this sort, all for kids. Also check out his
Rose, Where Did you Get that Red?

Best,
Joseph

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 900 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web
archives at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project, and respect our decision to
operate a moderated list. For subscription information or to
contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Please note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific rather than general interests, and also to keep the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and
two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that basis;
however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between
this and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to
be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under
individual review, in which case only their messages would
be received for moderators' approval before being forwarded
to the list. For further information, please see number 4, the
Cautions section of this Welcome Message. We remain
committed to this editorial function as a defining element of
the Poetics List.

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this
list have forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide
by list policies as stated in this Welcome message. While we
adhere to a practice of not discussing particular cases on the
list, the areas of our greatest concern include flaming of other
list subscribers, including the list owners, and/or giving us
false registration information. Please note some individuals
have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames
of the list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List
exists to support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern
and contemporary poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what
is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog, as well as
announcements of events important to our subscribers. For this
reason, the list has always been private or moderated: so that
we can do the best job possible to ensure the editorial project
that underlies our efforts.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your
old address, please contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be
temporarily suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe
to the list by contacting the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to one week or more for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome. Feel free to query the list moderators if you are
uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions to
the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on
publications and reading series that they have coordinated, edited,
published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees or the list owners, also messages designed to
"waste bandwidth" or cause the list to reach its daily limit.
These messages are considered offensive and detrimental to
list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be
removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

'Caveat lector': The Poetics List has become increasingly, though
in small proportion, occupied by subscribers who interest themselves
in pseudonymous authorship. The practice, while not encouraged by
the moderators, is tolerated on the grounds that it is no more
practicably eradicable than effectually harmful - not harmful,
that is, until it becomes so on the level of particular, individual
interactions. The feeling, for subscribers unaware of the circumstance,
may be - and perhaps justifiably so - one of having been 'duped.'
That said, we have felt it necessary to caution subscribers to
read carefully and be sure of your acquaintance as it suits your
personal comfort.

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

For reasons of basic security, we actively discourage the
sending of HTML-formatted messages to the list. A quick
glance at the list archive and at list digests (see sections 5
and 9) will show that HTML-formatted messages are not
interpreted by the listserv program as it is currently
configured, which makes their reading inconvenient at
best. All messages intended for the Poetics List should
be sent in ASCII or Text-Only format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission
of the author! Posting on the list is a form of publication.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "Review Subscribership" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review subscribers"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information. Address queries are, of course, welcome
to be posted to the list.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

PRIVACY FOR SALE AT ... EBAY?

I'm not sure why we have to go all the way to Israel for a shocking
report on invasion of privacy at eBay, but, apparently, we do.

According to the Tel Aviv daily newspaper Haaretz, recently Joseph
Sullivan, eBay's "director of law enforcement and compliance," spoke to
law enforcement agencies at a conference in Connecticut called "Cyber
Crime 2003."

The speech was "closed to reporters," writes Haaretz's reporter, Yval
Dror, and no wonder. Having "obtained a recording of the lecture," Dror
writes that Sullivan told the audience: "eBay is willing to hand over
everything it knows about visitors to its website" to anybody in law
enforcement, no subpoena necessary. In fact, a FAX is fine.

eBay can get away with this because "when someone uses our site and
clicks on the 'I Agree' button, it is as if he agrees to let us submit
all of his data to legal authorities," Sullivan said.

So anyone from a police detective to a CIA employee, FBI agent or
National Park ranger can make a request to receive all eBay knows about
a customer. Then, routinely, "eBay sends back the user's full name,
email address, home address, mailing address, home telephone number,
name of company where seller is employed and user nickname," Dror
writes.

"What's more, eBay will send the history of items he has browsed,
feedbacks received, bids he has made, prices he has paid, and even
messages sent in the site's various discussion groups." And don't worry
if your request is about an old customer. eBay has saved "every iota of
data" that has come through since the company began in 1995.

Why the zeal to release this kind of data?. "We believe that one of the
ways to fight fraud is to cooperate with the legal authorities at the
various levels," says eBay spokesperson Kevin Pursglove. Aha: So cozying

up with the right people in law enforcement means eBay may ask for an
exchange of favors as well?

That sounds awful, but it gets worse. When computers at eBay sense
suspicious behavior on the part of a customer, Sullivan and his six
investigators have created "pseudo buyers" with "simulated histories"
and "simulated feedback" to draw suspects into the open (the word
"entrapment" is not used).

With such antics as this, Sullivan has found ways to "help" law
enforcement even further. "Tell us what you want to ask the bad guys,"
he told the conference, according to Dror. "We'll send them a form,
signed by us, and ask them your questions. We will send their answers
directly to your e-mail."

As Dror concludes: "Essentially, by engaging in what seems like
impersonation, eBay is exploiting its relationship with customers to
pass on information to law enforcement."

And it still gets worse: Last year, eBay bought the credit-clearing
Internet service PayPal. From this, Sullivan reportedly boasted of
having a new "20 million files on its users," and said to the law
enforcement agencies: "If you contact me, I will hook you up with the
PayPal people. They will help you get the information you're looking
for. In order to give you details about credit card transactions, I have

to see a court order. I suggest that you get one, if that's what you're
looking for."

Whoa: Sullivan can look at these files (and those of Half.com, which
eBay also owns) and advise law enforcers whether *they* need a court
order? Is that really what he means? Would that be invasion of privacy
or just plain spying?

Well, we're a long way away from Kenneth Starr's demand of booksellers
to reveal Monica Lewinsky's book-purchasing records. With "details about

credit card transactions" so amply available behind the scenes, Starr
and other prosecutors need never be embarrassed by bad publicity or
court orders, at least from eBay.

And what a shame all this is: eBay has long had the reputation of being
the safest place to buy and sell on the Internet because it offers a
self-cleaning environment. Customers share their experiences about
buyers and sellers and warn each other about "the bad guys."

But a story like this from Haaretz could scare off millions - I know
I'll never use eBay again - especially since Dror looks at Sullivan's
zealotry in the context of 9/11.

"One would think that preserving privacy of the users, whose moves are
so meticulously recorded, would be keenly observed at eBay, whose good
name in the Internet community is one of its prime assets," Dror writes.

"But in the U.S. of the post 9/11 and pre-Gulf War II era, helping the
'security forces' is considered a supreme act of patriotism."

That's what it looks like from afar, but one wonders what eBay is really

up to.

Thanks to weblogger John Adams at http://www.jzip.org for tipping me off

to this story. If the American press doesn't report it, you can find it

This particular claim – that poets are the unacknowledged etc – has always
exasperated me and hearing it repeated the other day at a reading of poets
against the war did nothing to lessen my irritation.

Which poets? The good? Bad? Mediocre? But that’s just a quibble.

Legislators, acknowledged or otherwise, make laws. Whatever the relationship
poets may have with ‘laws’, it’s not this. Some/many poets may
discover/reveal/explore/test laws, but that’s it – they don’t frame them or
impose them. (What laws are we talking about here? Truths is probably a
better word, although problematic – well, what isn’t?)

Poets are the unacknowledged cartographers or scientists or oracles of the
world.

... anyone familiar with the film "The Ern Malley Story"
(http://jacketmagazine.com/17/movie-100.html)
could have told him that; John Wayne as Marcel Proust (in the famous "dream
scene") was a knockout:

"An unusually  subtle performance... soulful looks... eye shadow... the rat
hunt was harrowing ..."
                 -- N.Y.Times

"Wayne handles the role well, considering his lack of a horse..."
                 -- L.A.Mirror

"When John Wayne as the handsome young Marcel Proust gently stroked the
hand of the groom, I almost fainted..."

If you're in Baltimore for the AWP or otherwise, you are very welcome to
attend two events which address the capacities/responsibilities of
poets/poetry in this time of threatened war against Iraq.

BARBARIC YAWPS AT THE ENOCH PRATT LIBRARY
Friday 28 February 11-1pm
Open Reading including Pierre Joris on Arab & Iraqi poetry; Jane
Sprague, "Poetry, Politics and Translation: American Isolation & The
Middle East"; Kazim Ali on "Monument and War: Maya Lin, Yoko Ono, and
the New York City Peace Rally"; Gabe Gudding, "Dung in an Age of Empire;
poems by Wendy Carlisle, James Cervantes, Joelle Hahn, Patrick Herron,
Toni Asanti Lightfoot, Anastasios Kozaitis and Your Name Here.  MC:
Mairéad Byrne.

Barbaric Yawps at the AWP
St. George Room, Friday 28 February, 2.30-4.00pm
Panel discussion questioning Laura Bush's assertion "There is nothing
political about American literature," Dana Gioia's claim that "the urge
to politicize art proves irresistible to the ignorant, the lazy, and the
small-minded of all persuasions," and  Stanley Fish's argument that no
university, and therefore no university official, should ever take a
stand on any social, political, or moral issue."  Panelists include
Pierre Joris, Jane Sprague, Kazim Ali, Toni Asante Lightfoot, and
Mairéad Byrne (moderator).

Note: The library is easy to get to and under a mile from the
Renaissance Harborplace.

From the hotel, walk  a long block west on Pratt to Charles Street and
make a right. Come north on Charles for 6 long blocks and turn
left\(west) on either Mulberry or  Franklin. We're on the next block
over across from the green-domed church. We'll be in the Poe Room on the
second floor.  Bring your own lunch!
[Thanks to WOM-PO for directions]

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Good dream!  From the seamstresses' point of view, in this case in
Lower East Side sweatshops (from _Crazy Melon and Chinese Apple: The
Poems of Frances Chung_, Wesleyan U. Press, emphasis added):

The noise stops for a brief respite but the sewing activity really
doesn't. Preparations for the afternoon hours. Folding collars and
pockets. Knowing both sides of cloth. Tying MANUFACTURER'S LABELS
THAT YOU CAN'T READ YOURSELF. You have your own identification
number. Getting your share of the free tea before the supply is
exhausted. Going to the bathroom of no toilet paper. Punching out.
Taking out lunch cooked in the morning or food from last night's
dinner in thermos or baby food jars. The Chinese jars that one can
recognize by shape. Rice for sustenance. Food from Chinatown and its
sweet creamy coffee. The latest Glamour styles are sewn for a few
pennies. Doesn't the dust get into your lungs? What kind of lunch
hour is this? Thirty minutes.
[...]
When the sewing is good (prices are high) at the factory, the women
are happy. They say that they are eating 'soy sauce chicken.' One
woman says that she takes the number 11 to work, meaning her two legs.

The factory ladies, grateful for elevators and drafts of fresh air,
develop a bent back from their positions at work. They sometimes wear
cloth masks over their mouths, like doctors in an operating room. (No
one has heard of D. H. Lawrence.)

The threads in your machine are entangled. You have made a mistake
and must take apart your sewing. Beyond the fire escape you can see
into other factories, through replicas of your own dust-ridden
window. Lunchtime is suddenly over.

(Pp. 61-62)

2.27.03, 13:00, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey

=20

A former student of mine who recently graduated came back to campus to =
see me the other day. He was making the rounds announcing his impending =
marriage. Delighted for him, I said, "Congratulations! When?" He looked =
down at his feet for a few seconds and when he looked back up at me all =
the happiness had left his face. "I don't know," he said. "We will =
wait." Standing between him and married life is 8-16 months of =
compulsory military service, and potentially an extended period of =
conflict in the region, conflict in which he may be personally involved. =
He thinks a U.S. invasion of Iraq would just be the beginning. He's =
probably right.

=20

Turkey's main concern with regard to a possible war in Iraq (of many =
besides the economy) is the Iraqi Kurds. The Kurds in Iraq are =
substantial in number, presently occupy and govern their own territory, =
and have a large militia (70,000-130,000). In the event of a war that =
topples Sadam's regime, they will be gunning for their own state.=20

=20

Far from agreeing to let this happen, Turkey in fact proposes to move =
into Kurdish territory after the American invasion for the purpose of =
supplying "humanitarian aid." Did I forget to mention that the Kurds are =
sitting on top of a lot of oil? Well, they are. Their Jerusalem is a =
city called Kirkuk, an "oil rich" place.

=20

Needless to say, a Turkish presence in Northern Iraq would not be =
welcome and the leadership of the Iraqi Kurds has already promised that =
there would be conflict.=20

=20

Peter W. Galbraith, writing in the New York Times, suggests that the =
Iraqi Kurds are again about to be double-crossed by the U.S.=20

=20

My student and I continued to talk for a while, about the war, not his =
marriage. The silences between our talk grew longer and longer. Finally, =
he stood up, dejected, shook my hand, said goodbye and left. =20

Dear Joseph Massey,

Charles Bernstein believes that your personal attack on Ron Silliman is not
in the best interests of this list.  Darth Vader?  However, I am not writing
to you in an official capacity.  I just thought that I would give you a heads
up.  I'd hate to be forced to ask you to leave the Poetics list, but if I
have to, I will.  And btw why not send Charles a copy of yr chapbook? perhaps
he'll like it--he's always beating the bush for what's going on invisibly,
under the radar.  I hope we can dialogue further re this.  In the meantime,
why not resist posting for several weeks until this blows over?  Perhaps you
should wait for me to tell you when yr next post would be appropriately timed.

All the best,

Lori

Blogs

                I too, dislike them: there are things that are important beyond all this
fiddle.
                Reading them, however, with a perfect contempt for them, one
discovers that there is in
                        them after all, a place for the maudlin.
                Minds that can't grasp an imaginary turd, findings
                                that make the eyes dilate, hair
                                        on neglected parts of the body, these things
                                                                        are important not because a

                blogger's high sounding "interpretation" can be put upon them, but because
they are
                free.  When they become so mundane as to become _ad hominem_
                        well, the same thing may be said for
                                                -- well, _some_ of us, that we
                        "do not criticize what we
                                        don't understand": the bat held upside down in quest of
                                                                        some balls, the balls

                eating elephants, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a
                                a tireless wolf under a tree (now _that's_
                        unusual, yet the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse
                                that takes a flea under a tree is a base-­
                                ball fan, a statistician -- oops, I thought I was blogging...
                        again)
                                        -- nor is it valid to discriminate against
                                                                        "business documents and

                school-books": all these "phenomena" are important (if secondary). One
must make
                        a distinction: when dragged into prominence by half bloggers,
                                the result is not blogging, but "writing" -- nor till
                        the bloggers among us, "hyperventilators of
                                criticism" -- above insolence and triviality and
                                                                        a loyal fan base can

                present for public indigestion, revolutionary values with
                                real poets in them, shall we have
                um, them. In the meantime, if you demand on one hand,
                        the raw material of blogs in all their obtuse, necrophilic,
pretentious
                                        grace, and that which is on the other hand
                        genuine, then you are interested in blogging.
                                                                        I suggest you try www.blogspost.com.

mapped like my friend Jim, which whom the clarity spins. yet in the august
taproot of imperial laundry, these sayings resemble poetic ilk. this leads
to the choppy waters of serving those fences, were we so reposed, until odds
are kempt turning over letters. mildew for reasons, squeaks the pharmacist,
a Jim of some networking. but Jim, in poetry, means divot along the highway.
and Jim at the fractured renting of your name is at a different party
altogether. merely being Jim at Super Stop & Shop mutters of billions,
adipose billions. these are not the answers, says Jim. it is as if there are
names filled with apparent distances, and the language has been. Jim has
been, too. which wattage most of all, when we get to that tremendous?
answers are simply upheaval, you'd be better. Jim at the tournament knows he
must score quickly. it's in the age of retention, a matter of fact buttery
quality, while salient whatsis runs amok. we cannot have it exactly this
way, says one Jim to another. it's all so complicated, like dates in the
mirror, or time itself, as a lodestar for nearby farm animals. gee, says
Jim, an anvil for the nonce. others stand up with lots of battered details.
it could be the "way to go", someone opines. this is reasonable. we aren't
exactly Texans, say the New Mexicans (temperate Jims) who have been really,
really stocky, and subtle and loose on horses. the discussion veritably
encapsulates the whole war zone, says Jim, in  particular. and Jim, the
sprayed out proxy for an associated generation, denies as simply as saying.
so there, finally, is the rim of the extent.

Not a question of truth but belief. Shelley was saying that what poets
believe now, others acknowledge later. It's actually quite simple.

The war's saw-toothed shadow wads
itself up as it snows again, throws
itself almost out, but for the oblivion
white means to say in its honest moments.
The inevitable comparisons with milk
and that other product of pulled udders,
pearls

and the breath of the dead (war
says hi!), uncrumple like beloved bills
slapped to a drugstore counter in exchange
for Fleet enema. The old men so happy

to watch youth burn up the underbrush
on new territory like to keep things
to themselves. If the generals had it
their way, it would snow long and deep;
drifts of sudden economy to lighten the trenches

of the dead and their secrets.

Thanks for posting this, Walter. If "we" only knew the conditions of labor
in "our" dreams! Which is "the work" here of Frances Chung   "Sew Your Own"
is the guilt free solution - Maria Damon responding that she may
cross-stitch "poetry" into her work - yet, I assume, Chung clearly is much
more interested in transforming the conditions of the work (and not throwing
the people she renders out of work).
Of course my dream of "garment industries in league with anti-war protests"
was probably hopelessly ironic and/or utopic in the first place.

In any case, it's great to see this work with which I am not familiar.

2.  At the Poetry Slam with Dana Gioia


“The “Chocolate Genius” spits on me
   While rapping out his ‘poetry’.
But I don’t mind a little mist
   Because I am a populist.

It’s true, his passion’s misdirected—
   I’ll write an essay to correct it.
You’ll never touch the Absolute
   Addressing Puerto Rican roots.

Still, I prefer his faulty metrics
   To theory-drunken academics’.
This has an art brut, street appeal—
   If it ain’t good, at least it’s real.

It’s oral poetry, this rap—
   Tradition peeks out from the crap.
True, I can’t completely back it
   But I sure look sweet in a leather jacket.

 And I perceive a subtler function—
   To slam the door on Deconstruction.
Just think!  The freshest minds among us
   Intoning Causley and Catullus

And all the French wags I don’t like
   Prostrate before the open mike!
The prosody of spoken word will
   Lead the common man to Virgil

Dispelling Theory’s fads and fashions
   With the merest whiff of canon.
The art restored!  And I its leader
   Beloved by the common reader.”

The Genius reads his final page
   Screws back the mike and leaves the stage.
The crowd cheers, leaves—all one-two-three go
   For double non-fat mochaccinos.

Edwin Torres started creating text and performance work in 1988 under the
banner "I.E. Interactive Eclecticism."   In 1990 he discovered poetry at Th=
e
Nuyorican Poets Caf=E9 and the St. Mark's Poetry Project and poems evolved ou=
t
of his I.E. Monologues.  He has since collaborated with a wide range of
artists, creating performances that mingle poetry with improvisation, visua=
l
theater, music and sound.  His media assault includes MTV's first Spoken
Word Unplugged and in Rolling Stone, High Times, and New York Magazine; his
CD Holy Kid was part of the Whitney Museum's American Century Part II
exhibit.  His books include The All-Union Day of the Shock Worker (Roof
Books), Fractured Humorous (Subpress), Onomalingua:  Noise Songs and Poetry
(Rattapallax), and three self-published chapbooks, SandHommeNomadNo, Lung
Poetry (with photos by Luigi Cazzaniga), and I Hear Things People Haven't
Really Said.  Edwin is currently co-editing POeP!, an eJournal, and Cities
of Chance:  An Anthology of New Poetry from the United States and Brazil
(Rattapallax).

David Larsen is a graduate student in UCB's Comp. Lit. department, where he
works on Greek and Arabic. He is also writing a horror comic entitled
"Basket of Blood." His art, writing, and art writing have appeared in Old
Gold, Explosive, Kenning, Chain, the St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter,
and numerous self-published booklets, many in the collection of the Bancrof=

Fellow Legislators,

When Shelley wrote "unacknowledged legislators" the term "legislator" did=20
not mean a Senator or MP; it arose from the French Revolution and it meant=
=20
a visionary, a charismatic leader who could lead humanity through the=20
perception of reason and brilliance of rhetoric.  It is more the visionary=
=20
revolutionary, such as embodied in the poem "Queen Mab."  Or take a look at=
=20
Volney's "Ruins of Empire," the main pre-Marx text of the revolutionary=20
movement.  Now does the phrase make sense?

'Mister Rogers' Dies of Cancer at 74
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS


Filed at 12:13 p.m. ET

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Fred Rogers, who gently invited millions of children to
be his neighbor as host of the public television show ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood'' for more than 30 years, died of cancer early Thursday. He was
74.

Rogers died at his Pittsburgh home, said family spokesman David Newell, who
played Mr. McFeely on the show. Rogers had been diagnosed with stomach
cancer sometime after the holidays, Newell said.

``He was so genuinely, genuinely kind, a wonderful person,'' Newell said.
``His mission was to work with families and children for television. ...
That was his passion, his mission, and he did it from day one.''

From 1968 to 2000, Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister, produced the
show at Pittsburgh public television station WQED. The final new episode,
which was taped in December 2000, aired in August 2001, though PBS
affiliates continued to air back episodes.

Rogers composed his own songs for the show and began each episode in a set
made to look like a comfortable living room, singing ``It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood,'' as he donned sneakers and a zip-up cardigan.

``I have really never considered myself a TV star,'' Rogers said in a 1995
interview. ``I always thought I was a neighbor who just came in for a
visit.''

His message remained simple: telling his viewers to love themselves and
others. On each show, he would take his audience on a magical trolley ride
into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where his puppet creations would
interact with each other and adults.

Rogers did much of the puppet work and voices himself. He also studied early
childhood development at the University of Pittsburgh and consulted with an
expert there over the years.

``He was certainly a perfectionist. There was a lot more to Fred than I
think many of us saw,'' said Joe Negri, a guitarist who on the show played
the royal handyman in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe and owner of
``Negri's Music Shop.''

Negri said Rogers refused to accept shoddy ad-libbing by guests who may have
thought they could slack off during a kid's show.

But Rogers could also enjoy taping as if he were a child himself, Negri
recalled. Once, he said, the two of them fell into laughter because of the
difficulty they had putting up a tent on the show.

Rogers taught children how to share, deal with anger and even why they
shouldn't fear the bathtub by assuring them they'll never go down the drain.

``He talked directly to children and they listened. He nurtured creativity,
self-esteem, curiosity and self-discipline, and his profound contributions
will live on, as will the spirit of the man who created them,'' said Pat
Mitchell, president of PBS.

During the Persian Gulf War, Rogers told youngsters that ``all children
shall be well taken care of in this neighborhood and beyond -- in times of
war and in times of peace,'' and he asked parents to promise their children
they would always be safe.

``We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility,'' he said in
1994. ``It's easy to say 'It's not my child, not my community, not my world,
not my problem.'

``Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people
my heroes.''

Rogers came out of broadcasting retirement last year to record public
service announcements for the Public Broadcasting Service telling parents
how to help their children deal with the anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks.

``If they see the tragedy replayed on television, they might think it's
happening at that moment,'' he said.

Rogers' show won four Emmy Awards, plus one for lifetime achievement. He was
given a George Foster Peabody Award in 1993, ``in recognition of 25 years of
beautiful days in the neighborhood.''

At a ceremony marking the show's 25th anniversary that year, Rogers said,
``It's not the honors and not the titles and not the power that is of
ultimate importance. It's what resides inside.''

The show's ratings peaked in 1985-86 when about 8 percent of all U.S.
households with televisions tuned in. By the 1999-2000 season, viewership
had dropped to about 2.7 percent, or 3.6 million people.

As other children's programming opted for slick action cartoons, Rogers
stayed the same and stuck to his soothing message.

Off the set, Rogers was much like his television persona. He swam daily,
read voraciously and listened to Beethoven. He once volunteered at a state
prison in Pittsburgh and helped set up a playroom there for children
visiting their parents.

One of Rogers' red sweaters hangs in the Smithsonian Institution.

Rogers was born in Latrobe, 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. Early in his
career, Rogers was an unseen puppeteer in ``The Children's Corner,'' a local
show he helped launch at WQED in 1954. In seven years of unscripted, live
television, he developed many of the puppets used in his later show,
including King Friday XIII and Curious X the Owl.

He was ordained in 1963 with a charge to continue his work with children and
families through television. That same year, Rogers accepted an offer to
develop ``Misterogers,'' his own 15-minute show, for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.

He brought the show back to Pittsburgh in 1966, incorporating segments of
the CBC show into a new series distributed by the Eastern Educational
Network to cities including Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.

In 1968, ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began distribution across the
country through National Educational Television, which later became the
Public Broadcasting Service.

Rogers' gentle manner was the butt of some comedians. Eddie Murphy parodied
him on ``Saturday Night Live'' in the 1980s with his ``Mister Robinson's
Neighborhood,'' a routine Rogers found funny and affectionate.

Rogers is survived by his wife, Joanne, a concert pianist; two sons; and two
grandsons.

I heard an interview with Dave Newell on the Christian radio station this
morning... not long ago I heard a "this American life" on NPR in which a man
who had met Mr. Rogers as a kid revisited him many years later, and found
him to be exactly the same as he remembered him, talking and acting and
dressing completely in character!

of course I have my own memories of watching Mr. Rogers, but i'll keep those
to myself today, sadly...

'Mister Rogers' Dies of Cancer at 74
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS


Filed at 12:13 p.m. ET

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Fred Rogers, who gently invited millions of children to
be his neighbor as host of the public television show ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood'' for more than 30 years, died of cancer early Thursday. He was
74.

Rogers died at his Pittsburgh home, said family spokesman David Newell, who
played Mr. McFeely on the show. Rogers had been diagnosed with stomach
cancer sometime after the holidays, Newell said.

``He was so genuinely, genuinely kind, a wonderful person,'' Newell said.
``His mission was to work with families and children for television. ...
That was his passion, his mission, and he did it from day one.''

>From 1968 to 2000, Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister, produced the
show at Pittsburgh public television station WQED. The final new episode,
which was taped in December 2000, aired in August 2001, though PBS
affiliates continued to air back episodes.

Rogers composed his own songs for the show and began each episode in a set
made to look like a comfortable living room, singing ``It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood,'' as he donned sneakers and a zip-up cardigan.

``I have really never considered myself a TV star,'' Rogers said in a 1995
interview. ``I always thought I was a neighbor who just came in for a
visit.''

His message remained simple: telling his viewers to love themselves and
others. On each show, he would take his audience on a magical trolley ride
into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where his puppet creations would
interact with each other and adults.

Rogers did much of the puppet work and voices himself. He also studied early
childhood development at the University of Pittsburgh and consulted with an
expert there over the years.

``He was certainly a perfectionist. There was a lot more to Fred than I
think many of us saw,'' said Joe Negri, a guitarist who on the show played
the royal handyman in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe and owner of
``Negri's Music Shop.''

Negri said Rogers refused to accept shoddy ad-libbing by guests who may have
thought they could slack off during a kid's show.

But Rogers could also enjoy taping as if he were a child himself, Negri
recalled. Once, he said, the two of them fell into laughter because of the
difficulty they had putting up a tent on the show.

Rogers taught children how to share, deal with anger and even why they
shouldn't fear the bathtub by assuring them they'll never go down the drain.

``He talked directly to children and they listened. He nurtured creativity,
self-esteem, curiosity and self-discipline, and his profound contributions
will live on, as will the spirit of the man who created them,'' said Pat
Mitchell, president of PBS.

During the Persian Gulf War, Rogers told youngsters that ``all children
shall be well taken care of in this neighborhood and beyond -- in times of
war and in times of peace,'' and he asked parents to promise their children
they would always be safe.

``We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility,'' he said in
1994. ``It's easy to say 'It's not my child, not my community, not my world,
not my problem.'

``Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people
my heroes.''

Rogers came out of broadcasting retirement last year to record public
service announcements for the Public Broadcasting Service telling parents
how to help their children deal with the anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks.

``If they see the tragedy replayed on television, they might think it's
happening at that moment,'' he said.

Rogers' show won four Emmy Awards, plus one for lifetime achievement. He was
given a George Foster Peabody Award in 1993, ``in recognition of 25 years of
beautiful days in the neighborhood.''

At a ceremony marking the show's 25th anniversary that year, Rogers said,
``It's not the honors and not the titles and not the power that is of
ultimate importance. It's what resides inside.''

The show's ratings peaked in 1985-86 when about 8 percent of all U.S.
households with televisions tuned in. By the 1999-2000 season, viewership
had dropped to about 2.7 percent, or 3.6 million people.

As other children's programming opted for slick action cartoons, Rogers
stayed the same and stuck to his soothing message.

Off the set, Rogers was much like his television persona. He swam daily,
read voraciously and listened to Beethoven. He once volunteered at a state
prison in Pittsburgh and helped set up a playroom there for children
visiting their parents.

One of Rogers' red sweaters hangs in the Smithsonian Institution.

Rogers was born in Latrobe, 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. Early in his
career, Rogers was an unseen puppeteer in ``The Children's Corner,'' a local
show he helped launch at WQED in 1954. In seven years of unscripted, live
television, he developed many of the puppets used in his later show,
including King Friday XIII and Curious X the Owl.

He was ordained in 1963 with a charge to continue his work with children and
families through television. That same year, Rogers accepted an offer to
develop ``Misterogers,'' his own 15-minute show, for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.

He brought the show back to Pittsburgh in 1966, incorporating segments of
the CBC show into a new series distributed by the Eastern Educational
Network to cities including Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.

In 1968, ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began distribution across the
country through National Educational Television, which later became the
Public Broadcasting Service.

Rogers' gentle manner was the butt of some comedians. Eddie Murphy parodied
him on ``Saturday Night Live'' in the 1980s with his ``Mister Robinson's
Neighborhood,'' a routine Rogers found funny and affectionate.

Rogers is survived by his wife, Joanne, a concert pianist; two sons; and two
grandsons.

I assume you mean driving or train.

Ottawa is about 8 hours straight along the 401 highway from Detroit, with
Toronto being almost exactly in the middle. Now, how far is Chicago from
Detroit?

ERIC BOGOSIAN AND JIM CARROLL
On the New York stage Eric Bogosian has attained singular achievement. In
the last twenty years, he has authored five full-length plays and created
six full-length solos for himself. For these, he has received three OBIE
awards and a Drama Desk Award. His two best known plays, Talk Radio, at the
New York Shakespeare Festival, and subUrbia, at Lincoln Center Theatre, wer=
e
each translated into acclaimed films. Talk Radio, directed by Oliver Stone,
garnered Bogosian the Berlin Film Festival Silver Bear award for his work a=
s
author and star. Richard Linklater directed the acclaimed film version of
subUrbia. Bogosian=B9s credits as playwright also include Griller (Goodman
Theater and Center Stage, Baltimore), Humpty Dumpty (McCarter Theater), Red
Angel (Williamstown), and Bitter Sauce (for The Acting Company). His solos
include Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll, Pounding Nails in the Floor with My
Forehead and Drinking in America. He has toured throughout the United State=
s
and Europe. His solos and plays are performed by acting companies
internationally. Last year, Simon & Schuster published Bogosian=B9s first
novel Mall. His novella, Notes from Underground, was published by TCG in
1995. He has made numerous appearances as a film and television actor,
working with some of the leading directors of our time: Robert Altman, Paul
Schrader, Woody Allen, and Atom Egoyan. He has starred in films as diverse
as Bright Shining Lie to Under Siege II.

Jim Carroll is a poet, diarist, musician, performer, actor, and best-sellin=
g
author of six books. With his now-classic The Basketball Diaries, the
award-winning Living at the Movies, and his critically lauded Praying Manti=
s
spoken word album, he continues to pack concert halls for his poetry
performances. If Jim Carroll was "the Dylan of the 80s," he also voiced the
passion of the 90s. He heralded the new millennium with his first rock albu=
m
in fourteen years in 1998 that may well be the definitive work of his
career. Released in the same year as Void of Course, a collection of his
poetry, Pools of Mercury is an intense combination of new songs and
music-backed spoken-word pieces, including "8 Fragments for Kurt Cobain."
His Catholic Boy, named the second-most-popular album of 1980 by BAM, is no=
w
considered one of the last great punk albums. Musician, Player and Listener
described Carroll as "a transformer, chanting and moaning his litany into
something infinitely more palpable than symbols made of sounds." William
Burroughs called him "a born writer." His most recent release is Runaway EP
(2000).

Damian, you really need to relax.  protocol is so tedious.  if poetry were really as boring as some try to make it i think i'd have to kill myself as soon as possible!

Jim, you need to know that there are some of us out here who support you!  i really feel you're building some sort of momentum, and FRANKLY, who CARES if people are creeped out!  big deal!  people can just ignore your posts if they're SO DISTURBED!  (it cracks me up over and over to be honest, all the visual, the shock and horror that Jim is DOING something DIFFERENT!  so so scary!)

i mean, is this list for poets or pastry chefs?  actually i dated a pastry chef once and he was a mean muther, but fun, for a couple weeks, grrrrrr!

i applaud your direction, no matter how jagged you open the ground.

cut your way man, there's always something BRAND NEW out there, and sitting back sipping the martinis of dead bartenders is really what it's not about you know.

sincerely,
CAConrad
