My Soul Still A Virgin by Gulnar Ali Balata

Cover painting by Ghada Habib=20

Gulnar Ali Balata was born in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1974. She is the author of=
 two books of poems, Luna and Twelve Months (Hawar Press, 2006) and Song of=
 the Sad Ruins (Hawar Press, 2008) published in Duhok, Iraq. Gulnar has had=
 work appear in a number of literary journals, websites and anthologies in =
Kurdish and Arabic languages which are her first and second languages. She =
is now busy with her first story, a novel, and a third book of poetry.=20
She received an associates degree in English from Duhok, Iraq. She taught E=
nglish for three years before she left home in 1996. Gulnar received an ass=
ociates degree from Bunker Hill Community College in 2009. She currently is=
 working on her bachelors degree in art. Her work has been published in new=
spapers and magazines in Kurdish and extensively on the Internet.=20
She has been listed as one of the top Kurdish women's voices in modern Kurd=
ish poetry. Her poems have a romantic power. She uses a clean and pure voca=
bulary.=20


These are poems of exile, torn from the soil of the author's native Kurdist=
an. They are poems of the human spirit orphaned. They demand of the reader =
the care and compassion any orphan requires to retain hope and nurture the =
promise of return.=20
=E2=80=94T. Michael Sullivan, Director William Joiner Center's Writers' Wor=
kshop=20

Gulnar's poetry speaks in English the language of her native Kurdistan. The=
 mountains, streams, and valleys are both harsh and sensitive barriers in t=
he mist. The ever present partridge reminds us of the country's beauty and =
beyond them and before them lies its sadness. Gulnar Ali Balata is a wonder=
ful poet whom it has been my great pleasure to work with for the past sever=
al years watching her adapt her Kurdish and Arabic poetry to English.=20

Live Landscape by Andrey Gritsman

Andrey Gritsman is a poet and essayist, born and raised in Russia. He lives=
 in New York City and works as a physician. He has been widely published in=
 Russia, including five collections of poetry. Poems, essays and translatio=
ns in English have appeared in Manhattan Review, New Orleans Review, Denver=
 Quarterly, Notre Dame Review, Poet Lore, South Carolina Review and many ot=
hers and were anthologized in Modern Poetry in Translation (UK), in Crossin=
g Centuries (New Generation in Russian Poetry), The Breath of Parted Lips: =
Voices from the Robert Frost Place and in Stranger at Home: American Poetry=
 with an Accent . Collections of poetry and essays Long Fall was published =
by Spuyten Duyvil in 2004 and recent poetry collection PISCES by Numina Pre=
ss. Andrey=E2=80=99s work was nominated for the Pushcart Prize in 2005, 200=
6 and 2007 and was on the short list for the Joyce Osterweil/PEN American C=
enter Prize in Poetry in 2005. He runs the Intercultural Poetry Series in a=
 popular literary club Cornelia Street Caf=C3=A9 and edits international po=
etry magazine INTERPOEZIA .=20

Andrey Gritsman is quite literally a groundbreaking poet. From Moscow to Ne=
w York is a steep distance but Gritsman makes us aware of the threads that =
link seemingly disparate occasions. Fresh perceptions create new styles and=
 Gritsman=E2=80=99s is more than a synthesis of two cultures: it is an art =
that probes delusions and pleasures by a poet who has been around some daun=
ting blocks.=20
=E2=80=94Baron Wormser, author of Good Trembling and many other collections=
 of poetry.=20

Andrey Gritsman=E2=80=99s poems are unwavering in their honesty, relentless=
 in their assessment of contemporary life, and clear-eyed in their approach=
 to human love and mortality. We instantly recognize the terrain he is nego=
tiating. Perhaps only Gritsman, with his unprejudiced immigrant=E2=80=99s e=
ye, can describe the empty, arid landscape of the American West. These are =
poems that peer into the abyss behind the official public happiness of Amer=
ican life, the compulsion to be always hopeful, positive and bubbling over =
with good spirits. That is to say: they are real poems, and make no accommo=
dation with fanciful dreams. Read =E2=80=98em, and weep.=20
=E2=80=94Kurt Brown, poet, editor of several anthologies, founder, Aspen Wr=
iters=E2=80=99 Seminar=20

Gritsman=E2=80=99s poems are tenderness in transit. They fully inhabit thei=
r evoked circumstances so that their significance keeps expanding and reson=
ating before the quality of attention given over to them. He so quickly is =
able to penetrate to the depths in the poems, it is as though working with =
a large, oiled, sharp shovel while the rest of us are working with miniatur=
e dull and rusty spoons. The use of brevity in some of these poems remind m=
e of my beloved Denise Levertov. His poems are =E2=80=9Ctime-flooded=E2=80=
=9D and remind me that whether we look backward or forward in time always t=
he beloved figures are diminishing, disappearing, and the shadow growing fr=
om our own foot soles moves among the company of many other shadows. =E2=80=
=9CConstant departure,=E2=80=9D as he says it, is our state, and all we can=
 do is stand for our count, make our song, and salute each other.=20

FOR MY FATHER=20

After you've been gone,=20
I've been flying alone back and forth=20
above the waters and the continents.=20
Both of us: me here and you there=20
know too well that this is a waste of time=20
and space.=20
I may be flying, looking for you=20
for the rest of my life=20
or death, and still never see you.=20

Nothing can be undone,=20
and I can't take it.=20
Nor I can take the fact=20
that every time I see my close ones, I know,=20
it may be the last time I see them.=20

Don't worry about me. While I fly,=20
an angel in uniform attends me,=20
gives me some water and bread,=20
and smiles to me.=20
She takes care of me=20
until it's time to get out,=20

and then to disappear into crowd=20

Dear David

Once again, thank you for your kind words. I apologize for my delay in =
responding; we=92ve had family visiting us this past week.

So far, my knowledge of Sound Poetry has been limited to a short clip of =
The Four Horsemen. To me, their pieces sounded very much like creative =
music (free jazz), and I felt that I could have contributed to the =
group, had I lived in Toronto. I=92d like to hear more of their work, =
but don=92t know of any available recordings. I=92ve seen samples of =
their scores, but have no performances to enable me to follow them.

Your points about scoring work are well taken. Contemporary composers =
have employed a variety of notational systems. As long as the performers =
agree on what the notes, direction or images represent, the system =
employed for organizing sounds will work. Cracks in a sidewalk, if =
nothing else, could have important rhythmic and textural implications.=20=


I=92ve didn=92t read =93Un Coup de Des=94 until 2004. Mallarme=92s use =
of fonts creates a three-dimensional work, visually and aurally. If I=92d =
read him earlier, he would have been an influence on my work. In my own =
reading from that period, I=92ve never seen anything comparable to =93Un =
Coup de Des.=94 His language and its movement across the page give me =
both the image of a hand shaking the dice and the dice rolling across =
the page to stop at a capitalized word, as though the dice are being =
thrown even while the throwing hand is shaking them. Movement seems to =
happen and remain suspended at the same time.

As work on the page, IMPROVISATIONS ultimately creates a very precise =
=93musical notation=94 using language. Listening to the playback of what =
I consider a less than successful performance from the work at the =
Poetry Project in 2005, I discovered that my ear worked; the multiple =
lines came together in the kinds of =93verbal dissonance=94 I wanted to =
create in certain passages. Unfortunately, the microphones didn=92t pick =
up the voices of the other readers very well. In the process of =
composing the work, I took the license to employ an =93orchestral=94 =
approach, allowing me to =93play against=94 the poem while composing it. =
Space is integral to the work. In addition to rendering the=20
referentiality of any word or phrase =93provisional=94 until the next =
word or phrase appears, it also allows, in my own =93hearing=94 of the =
work as a performance, instrumental interludes,
in which the reader=92s silence allows space for musical commentary on =
the phrases. In=20
readings in which I haven=92t used  other readers I=92ve found other =
ways to recite the work so that the  =93problems of performance=94 find =
resolution. Certain sections of the poem require the readers to choose =
how they are going to read the intermingled  lines. While I can=92t =
recite a five-voice passage =93in harmony=94 during a solo reading, I =
can read the passage horizontally or vertically. At the Poetry Project, =
I read =93XLVIII=94 unaccompanied and resolved its multi-voiced =93problem=
 of performance=94 by reading the overlapping passages in one of about =
five possible sequences. Although the work is precisely =93notated,=94 =
the score does allow room for interpretation. Jim Gardiner, who knows my =
work very well, has on several occasions performed the work with several =
readers reciting =93cut-ups=94 of my multi-voices passages and pacing =
themselves so that however they interpret their lines, all the readers =
end at the same time.

Concerning my YouTube performance, I think your description of the =
=93poet/performer in action,=94 is very accurate in that the poem =
already exists and my performance brings out what is =93at once new to =
me, and yet not unknown=94 because I take improvisational  liberties in =
the overdubbed recitation and fill the space between textual passages =
with improvised basslines that give the performed work a different =
=93meaning=94 than the written text. My performing and presenting the =
text as a video does create a work encompassing =93all forms,=94 so to =
speak,  but even there, it=92s the presentation of all resources =
available within the performing situation and could be rendered in many =
different ways while working from the core piece.

Thank you once again for your kind words and informed commentary.

"Scalapino makes everything take place in real time, in the light and
air and night where all of us live, everything happening at once."
- Philip Whalen


Leslie Scalapino passed away on May 28, 2010 in Berkeley, California.
She was born in Santa Barbara in 1944 and raised in Berkeley,
California. After Berkeley High School, she attended Reed College in
Portland, Oregon and received her B.A. in Literature in 1966. She
received her M.A. in English from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1969, after which she began to focus on writing poetry.
Leslie Scalapino lived with Tom White, her husband and friend of 35
years, in Oakland, California.

In childhood, she traveled with her father Robert Scalapino, founder of
UC Berkeley's Institute for Asian Studies, her mother Dee Scalapino,
known for her love of music, and her two sisters, Diane and Lynne,
throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. She and Tom continued these travels
including trips to Tibet, Bhutan, Japan, India, Yemen, Mongolia, Libya
and elsewhere. Her writing was intensely influenced by these travels.
She published her first book O and Other Poems in 1976, and since then
has published thirty books of poetry, prose, inter-genre fiction, plays,
essays, and collaborations. Scalapino's most recent publications include
a collaboration with artist Kiki Smith, The Animal is in the World like
Water in Water (Granary Books), and  Floats Horse-Floats or Horse-Flows
(Starcherone Books), and her selected poems It's go in horizontal /
Selected Poems 1974-2006 (UC Press) was published in 2008. In 1988, her
long poem way received the Poetry Center Award,  the Lawrence Lipton
Prize, and the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation.
Her plays have been performed in San Francisco at New Langton Arts, The
Lab, Venue 9, and Forum; in New York by The Eye and Ear Theater and at
Barnard College; and in Los Angeles at Beyond Baroque.

In 1986, Scalapino founded O Books as a publishing outlet for young and
emerging poets, as well as prominent, innovative writers, and the list
of nearly 100 titles includes authors such as Ted Berrigan, Robert
Grenier, Fanny Howe, Tom Raworth, Norma Cole, Will Alexander, Alice
Notley, Norman Fischer, Laura Moriarty, Michael McClure, Judith Goldman
and many others. Scalapino is also the editor of four editions of O
anthologies, as well as the periodicals Enough (with Rick London) and
War and Peace (with Judith Goldman).

Scalapino taught writing at various institutions, including 16 years in
the MFA program at Bard College, Mills College, the San Francisco Art
Institute, California College of the Arts in San Francisco, San
Francisco State University, UC San Diego, and the Naropa Institute.

Of her own writing, Scalapino says "my sense of a practice of writing
and of action, the apprehension itself that 'one is not oneself for even
an instant' - should not be,' is to be participation in/is a social act.
That is, the nature of this practice that's to be 'social act' is it is
without formation or custom." Her writing, unbound by a single format,
her collaborations with artists and other writers, her teaching, and
publishing are evidence of this sense of her own practice, social acts
that were her practice. Her generosity and fiercely engaged intelligence
were everywhere evident to those who had the fortune to know her.

Scalapino has three books forthcoming in 2010. A book of two plays
published in one volume, Flow-Winged Crocodile and A Pair / Actions Are
Erased / Appear will come out in June 2010 from Chax Press; a new prose
work, The Dihedrons Gazelle-Dihredals Zoom will be released this summer
by Post-Apollo Press; and a revised and expanded collection of her
essays and plays, How Phenomena Appear to Unfold (originally published
by Potes & Poets) will be published in the fall by Litmus Press.

Her play Flow-Winged Crocodile will be performed in New York at Poets
House on June 19th at 2pm and June 20th at 7pm by the performance group
The Relationship, directed by Fiona Templeton and with Katie Brown,
Stephanie Silver, and Julie Troost. Dance by Molissa Fenley, music by
Joan Jeanrenaud, and projected drawings by Eve Biddle. This production
is co-sponsored by Belladonna* and the Poetry Project.

There will be a memorial event for Scalapino at St. Mark's Poetry
Project on Monday, June 21st.

A Zen Buddhist funeral ceremony will be conducted by Abbott Norman
Fisher in about a month with the arrangements in a subsequent
announcement. Tom requests that in lieu of flowers, Leslie's friends
consider a charitable donation in her memory to: Poets in Need, PO Box
5411, Berkeley, CA 94705;  Reed College for the Leslie Scalapino
Scholarship, 3203 Southeast Woodstock Boulevard, Portland, OR

I am devastated by this news, as I know many of you are.  Leslie Scalapino
is one of our greatest, most inventive American poets.  I can't put that in
the past tense.  I will write more when I get my wits about me.  Thank you,
Charles, for your posting.

Announcing the publication by BookThug of

MACHINE LANGUAGE

by David Dowker.


"MACHINE LANGUAGE delves the delic, from the 'pataphysical conjunction
of archaic paper tape code, a fragment of Sappho and the Gorgon
(apparatus) to
writing through (over under sideways around) various texts and
subtexts of the
post-modern North American rhizome, coding the flows of Black Mountain
poetics
and so-called 'language poetries,' elliptical traces of neo-surrealist
tendencies with
reconnaissance syntax and pliant iambics, love's number crunched for
the age of
surveillance."

Dear Vernon and Murat:

re the white spaces--i jotted this down in notebook=2C as an other way of t=
hinking of "white space" not as "silence"--but as "white noise"--

white spaces in poem-mallarme's "intervals"--in musical/visual composition-=
-("Un Coup de des")--
wondering--think
of white spaces as "white noise"--background sound of the Big Bang
radio-heard in universe--"out of noise arises music"--
neg-entropy
of--chaos/white noise--out of which EMERGE--patterns=2C rhythms=2C
poems--music----dissolution--decay--disappearance--back into noise--
and over again--
and again=20
and
the theme of "emerge/nce" is central to al my works in various media--
this (white noise/chaos)--is just another possibility in considering ways o=
f perceiving via al the senses--those areas out of which things emerge--

("Not to seek=2C but to find"--the element of the uncanny--rather than begi=
nning with a preconceived manner of apprehending the emergence=2C what does=
 emerge--of "placing it"--to be open--to what is found--something which may=
be "new to me=2C yet not unknown" as Emerson put it--this is why Mallarme i=
s provisional in his text--"a throw of the dice will never abolish chance"-=
-which is the unknown as it is found--"by chance"--)

a very strange example i just read is--(at once unrelated and related to th=
e subject at hand--perhaps a sort of "negative" or "counter" example!!-as G=
ombrowicz is indeed a "contrarian"---)--

in Gombrowicz's novel=2C COSMOS=2C--in the continual stream of chaos flowin=
g past the narrator--it is repeatedly noted throughout the book--the immedi=
ate human "scanning" so to speak--for patterns--for relationships among obj=
ects=2C bits of faces=2C stains on a wall--a hanged bird=2C a "hanged" piec=
e of wood=2C a hanged cat--and=2C finally--a hanged man--

there is a both a "suspension"-(things=2C beings=2C hanging in the air-)-an=
d a "finality" (death)--yet "life goes on"--the narrator goes back home to =
continue his war with his father--
(which may be of course be read in many ways Freudian=2C in terms of religi=
on=2C etc)

You are invited to participate in the first World Listening Day, which
happens on Sunday, July 18, 2010. The purposes of World Listening Day are:
. to celebrate the practice of listening as it relates to the world around
us, environmental awareness, and acoustic ecology;
. to raise awareness about issues related to the World Soundscape Project,
World Listening Project, World Forum for Acoustic Ecology, and individual
and group efforts to creatively explore phonography;
. and to design and implement educational initiatives which explore these
concepts and practices.

World Listening Day is being organized by the World Listening Project, in
partnership with other organizations. July 18 was chosen as the date for
World Listening Day because it is the birthday of the Canadian composer R.
Murray Schafer. Schafer is one of the founders of the Acoustic Ecology
movement. The World Soundscape Project, which he directed, is an important
organization which has inspired a lot of activity in this field, and his
book Soundscape: The Tuning of the World helped to define many of the terms
and background behind the acoustic ecology movement.

The World Listening Project invites you to participate in World Listening
Day. Here are several possibilities --
. You can set aside some time when you pay attention to your soundscape.
. You can organize a soundwalk or a listening party when people play field
recordings.
. You can organize a performance event that involves field recordings and
other artistic expressions that explore our soundscape and how we can listen
to our sonic environment.
. You can facilitate an educational event that relates to acoustic ecology,
field recordings, or a similar topic.
. You can contact organizations that are participating in World Listening
Day, to see if you can get involved that way.

World Listening Day includes the following organizations and projects:
American Society for Acoustic Ecology
Auroral Borealis Listening Group
Berg 26 (Berlin)
Chicago Phonography
Citizen Sound
Community Sound [e]Scapes
Fruit for the Apocalypse - "The Stepney Soundscape"

"Philosophy never confesses / its=20

Stecopoulos deploys the paradoxical force/fragility of poetry at all too=20

Eleni Stecopoulos is among a=20
constellation of contemporary U.S. poets effectively correlating=20
somatics (the everyday practices and conditions of bodies) with geopolitics=

through a radical and emergent lyricism. In Armies of Compassion=2C the=20
poet's body becomes a site allegorizing disasters of "immunity": the princi=

Antonin=20
Artaud's Theater and Its Double=2C reads: "The Grand-Saint-Antoine=20

what plagues us is not alterity=2C but the dangerous fiction that 'self' an=

An urgent note from Roland Prevost: save jwcurry & Room 302 Books!





john curry=2C certainly a world class poet living in our community=2C is pr=

Stephen Brockwell alerted
me of this precarious situation=2C by phone=2C and asked if I would get the

an unused resource. His archive documenting the growth of avant-garde
writing in Canada is one of the key collections in the country. Nicky Drumb=
olis has said: =93curry and his work are the best-kept secret in Canada.=94

Since time is of the essence=2C if curry=92s to avoid eviction=2C there are=
 a few ways you can help:

Start to use his goddamn store!

Donate outright.I would like to encourage
you to donate something so as to keep this excellent bookstore=2C
publisher=2C archive and artist alive=2C and at the same time help prevent
curry=92s eviction from his apartment. For those who=92d like to purchase

My contribution, "DOWN IN THE PARISH,"=A0can be read here:

http://thisshiningwound.blogspot.com/

Recently I=92ve discovered the holistic work of physicist-philosopher,
David Bohm, and am amazed by the intricate flow and interrelation
among all forms of matter. Decades ago he saw the segmented,
mechanistic view of reality as a dangerous justification for
unrestrained technology. Bohm further realized our entire system of
thought is incoherent. He believed fresh perspectives are attainable
only through imagination and the potential inherent in an artist=92s
inescapable need to create.

When working in the energy sector, specifically the heavy electrical
apparatus industry, I became aware of studies to determine the effect
of electromagnetic radiation on children. I also learned too many
utilities recklessly generate electricity using coal, gas, and nuclear
power. We must end our reliance on toxic energy supplies and quickly
transition to safe, renewable energy, or this planet will be
uninhabitable for most species. Reduce, reuse, recycle, bicycle, and
use mass transit!

I no longer apologize for writing poetry using metaphors drawn from nature.

Mary Jo Malo

The Renaissance Society presents

*Saviana Stanescu
=93NY THRU AN IMMIGRANT I or (r)EVOLUTION
(Flagstories and other personal histories)=94
Sunday, June 6, 2:00 pm*

*You are invited for The Renaissance Society's last event of the year - a
reading by Saviana Stanescu, followed by a reception with light refreshment=
s
in the gallery.*

Stanescu was a college student in 1989 when she participated in the Romania=
n
"revolution" and the so-called "end of communism". Now, after almost 20
years she witnesses the so-called "end of capitalism" in New York. This
autobiographical performative lecture explores her immigrant experience in
New York through the lens of a personal dichotomy East-West and a permanent
negotiation between the old and new set of values.

Playwright, poet, screenwriter, teacher, journalist, curator, Stanescu does
it all. Her work is often characterized by a black humor and a sense of the
absurd that is distinctly Eastern European. She wrote the screenplay for Do=
g
Luv  which is featured in the exhibition Seductiveness of the Interval. She
has won numerous awards and her plays have been widely presented
internationally and in the US. Recent New York productions include: Aliens
with Extraordinary Skills, Waxing West, and YokastaS Redux (co-authored wit=
h
Richard Schechner). She teaches at New York University.

*The reading will take place in Swift Hall room 106, at The University of
Chicago, 1025 East 58th Street (on the Main Quadrangle of the University,
directly east of Cobb Hall).  The reception will be at The Renaissance
Society, 5811 South Ellis Avenue, 4th floor, Cobb Hall. FREE*

Dear friends,

We at the Spare Room are asking you to participate in an afternoon of poetry
for voices  Sunday July 18.

In our business of bending literary tradition, we are working against the
notion of literature as solitary act. We will be spending an afternoon in
Portland, Oregon, out of doors,  performing and sharing works of poetry
composed or arranged for multiple voices.  In doing so, we are looking back
to the Greek Chorus, Louis Zukofsky's "A"-24, Canada's Four Horseman, and
others, but you are as much encouraged to bring your own work, or re-imagine
the work of others.

This is an open call, do pass it on.

Please let us know if you plan on attending, & any other information we
might find useful for promoting the event.

Thank you.
James Yeary, for Spare Room

Subject:      FUCK DEATH!
MIME-Version: 1.0

for Leslie Scalapino & Peter Orlovsky

Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the barve.
I know.  But I do not approve.  And I am not resigned.
--Edna St. Vincent Millay

It makes me angry that we die.  I'm on Edna St. Vincent Millay's side
with this one!  FUCK DEATH!  I am not resigned and will not intend to
ever be so!  Dying is a growing grief for the living.  A humiliating
and treacherous sadness in piecemeal THIS WORLD!

It was very sad to hear of the passing of Leslie Scalapino and Peter
Orlovsky.  I had the weirdest things happen with both of their works,
not weird really because everything we think weird or coincidental
will probably be revealed one day as the softest magic imaginable,
meaning WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG THE magic faucet roars beyond this
world.  But I recently stumbled across Leslie Scalapino's AMAZING book
<em>Crowd and not evening or light</em> JUST before hearing that she
had died.  And have since reread it, and loved it all over again.  I
despise religion which drives customs, which evaporates autonomy, and
SCALAPINO also OPENLY felt the same way over and over again in her
poems.  Like this great stanza:

people finding out what
they are -- because they don't have any
custom any longer -- we don't
not from suffering -- though going on
or their finding out, the women having been enslaved
the men dead -- custom -- suffering
made to be that

And today I wish I knew Peter Orlovsky's poems as much as I do
Scalapino's.  I heard him read in Philadelphia many years ago at the
Painted Bride Arts Center.  It was Lamont Steptoe who brought him here
I believe, but I'm not 100 percent sure.  The first person who ever
mentioned him to me was Molly Russakoff.

Today Molly and I went deep into Fairmount Park together.  We had a
picnic for Peter.  She had dated him at Naropa back in the 1970's at
the same time that Allen Ginsberg was dating him.  We had oranges and
wine and dark chocolate and kale and blue corn, and ate, and offered
some for Peter under the massive cottonwood tree in the park today.
It was beautiful, this.  This sharing and being together, being
grateful for our lives and WE MUST be grateful for our lives we know.

JUST before I found out that Peter died last week I was in the
Rittenhouse Library, sitting in front of the poetry section reading
from the marvelous anthology OUT OF THIS WORLD (St. Mark's Poetry
Project), and a book title's spine jumped out at me:  WHEN I WAS COOL.
 I forget the author, but Molly knew him as well, in fact the book was
about going to Naropa, and the author was there when Molly was there.
When Peter Orlovsky was teaching there, and Ted Berrigan, and it
sounded like a great time.

But I opened WHEN I WAS COOL to a page with Orlovsky's picture, and a
caption which read something like, "On the first day of class Peter
Orlovsky said, 'raise your hand if you think pussy tastes like
strawberry jam'" or something like that.

WITH LOVE TO THE LIVING.  I mind dying, I mind very much!  I do not
approve, and am not resigned!

In mourning Leslie Scalapino's death and in celebrating her multi-genre
poetry, I am coordinating a "Streaming / Reading Memorial" on my blog site,
Chant de la Sirene.  Four pieces have thus far been posted this week.  We
are looking forward to more:

Anyone who wishes to send in a short piece about Leslie, on the topic of
reading / re-reading her work, please backchannel me (
laurahinton12@gmail.com).

In related news, new poems up at Poets for Living Waters:

http://poetsgulfcoast.wordpress.com/



Poets for Living Waters is a poetry action in response to the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico begun on April 20, 2010, one of the most profound human-made ecological catastrophes in history.

The first law of ecology states that everything is connected to everything else. An appreciation of this systemic connectivity suggests a wide range of poetry will offer a meaningful response to the current crisis, including work that harkens back to Hurricane Katrina and the ongoing regional effects.

I like the "white noise" idea.

In a sense, it renders the universe more kinetic, always in motion, so th=
at even "silence"=20
may not be an absolute silence but a suspension of the kinetic elements t=
hat creates spatial=20
and rhythmic tension, and an element of undertainty.=20=20

As I envision "Un Coup de Des," my sense of the hand shaking the dice con=
tinuing=20
throughout the poem suggests to me a continuation of energy, not a cessat=
ion. In effect,=20=20
the space on the page would fill with the tension and anticipation arouse=
d while awaiting the=20
toss. In a universe in constant motion, e.g. from energy to matter and ba=
ck, the continual=20
flux of energy and matter would render the outcome of the poem/toss "prov=
isional".

Mingus Awareness Project 2010

a benefit concert for ALS support and research



Wednesday, June 23, 2010 (8 p.m.)



On June 23, a group of musicians will gather at The Jazz Showcase to
celebrate the life and music of Charles Mingus, and to benefit the Les
Turner ALS Foundation. Mingus, an American musical hero who died of ALS, is
one of the greatest figures in jazz history. His bass playing, compositions
and philosophy have transcended his genre and left indelible marks on music
history.



MAPtet will perform music by Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Rahsaan Roland
Kirk, and Eric Dolphy, as well as original compositions --

      Jon Hey -- piano

      Paul Hartsaw -- tenor saxophone

      Dan Godston -- trumpet

      Fred Jackson -- alto saxophone

      Jon Godston -- soprano saxophone

      Raphael Crawford -- trombone

      Tom Berg -- baritone saxophone

      Cory Biggerstaff -- upright bass

      Brian Jones -- drums



Admission: $20 / $15 for students



Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a raffle to win items.
All proceeds will go to benefit the Les Turner ALS Foundation.



Mingus Awareness Project is organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective, in
partnership with the Les Turner ALS Foundation. The Borderbend Arts
Collective is a 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to promote the arts,
to create opportunities for artists to explore new directions in and between
art forms, and to engage the community.



Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease
for the New York Yankees baseball icon, is a progressive neuromuscular
disorder that causes atrophy throughout the body, ultimately leading to
total paralysis. Brain cells cease sending messages to muscles, which slowly
prohibits patients' movement and their ability to communicate. Onset
commonly occurs between ages 35 to 65, and is slightly more prevalent in
men. There is currently no cure for ALS, but treatment and interventions can
help alleviate some symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival
by delaying respiratory failure. The clinical progression can vary widely;
however, patients typically live with the disease two to five years after
the onset of symptoms. ALS knows no racial, cultural or socioeconomic
boundaries and follows no pattern.



The Les Turner ALS Foundation, founded in 1977 is recognized internationally
and is the only independent publicly supported non-profit organization in
the Chicago-area devoted solely to the treatment and elimination of ALS. The
Foundation is affiliated with Northwestern University Feinberg School of
Medicine where it supports a large multidisciplinary clinical program and
two world-class scientific research laboratories.  The Foundation's
comprehensive patient services include support group meetings; professional
in-home consultation services; communications and durable medical equipment
programs; respite care grants; and educational programs.

Tsk tsk.
Since that remark can now be sourced, it can be used against "we" no matter
how sardonic or satiric it may have been meant. Whatever you do re this
disaster, DON'T shoot from the lip. Careless lips kill wildlife. Careful
lips demolish politicians and their cronies.

And, as Amy says, ACT.

Hi all,

I have the honor of curating this gig - please come and spread the word:

Jewish Art for the New Millennium: Avant-Garde Poetry and Music
Charles Bernstein, Kenneth Goldsmith, and Jamie Saft
Curated by Jake Marmer

Tue June 8th, 8:00 pm
Sixth Street Synagogue

Cover: $8 (includes a free drink)
RSVP on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=3D125609840793872

Sixth Street Synagogue, Foundation for Jewish Culture, and the Forward
present the first in a new series of innovative cultural evenings at
Sixth Street Synagogue. The =93Jewish Art for the New Millennium=94 series
is aimed to showcase cutting edge Jewish artists, who represent their
identity in most original, innovative ways.

The first night features three artists who represent different
generations, genres and aesthetics. Multi-instrumentalist musician
Jamie Saft, poet Charles Bernstein and writer/poet Kenneth Goldsmith
team up for an evening of intellectually provocative words and music
as each performs separately and then join forces for conversation.

Charles Bernstein is a rebel voice in the world of poetry and poetic
theory. Author of a number of acclaimed poetry collections including
this year=92s =93All the Whiskey in Heaven: Selected Poems=94 (Farrar,

Maxine Chernoff is both a poet and novelist. The Turning is her newest =
book
of poems, praised by Aaron Shurin who says, "Maxine Chernoff's poems are
born in the ache of the world in need of itself. Amid the false papers =
of
emptied language, this writing envisions 'a home inside the neutral =
gleam,'
where the heart of the authentic resides." She's published six books of
fiction, including Signs of Devotion, which was a New York Times Book =
Review
Notable Book. With Paul Hoover she edits New American Writing, and with =
him
she co-translated Selected Poems of Friedrich H=F6lderlin, which won the =
2009
PEN USA Translation Award.


Rachel Loden=92s new book of poems is Dick of the Dead, which was a =
finalist
for the California Book Award. A poem from the collection was recently
featured in the Washington Post=92s =93Poet=92s Choice=94 column, and it =
has been
called =93oddly sublime=94 and =93intoxicating=94 by the Poetry Project =
Newsletter
and =93expansive and whimsical=94 by the Brooklyn Rail. Loden=92s first =
book,
Hotel Imperium, was one of the San Francisco Chronicle=92s ten best =
poetry
books of the year. She is the recipient of a Pushcart Prize, an &NOW =
award,
a California Arts Council fellowship, and a grant from the Fund for =
Poetry.

Donna de la Perri=E8re is the author of True Crime (Talisman House, =
2009) and
the forthcoming St. Erasure (Talisman House, 2011).  The recipient of a =
2009
Fund for Poetry award, she teaches in the MFA and undergraduate creative
writing programs at California College of the Arts and San Francisco =
State
University, and curates the Bay Area Poetry Marathon reading series at =
San
Francisco's The Lab gallery and performance space.

 a playground of moving parts, of slides and ladders and radio chatter. Far=
rell composes at the level of the phrase, using parataxis and accretion rat=
her than subordinated sentence structures to build his sonic textures via j=
uxtaposition, non-grammatical fragments, portmanteau, codes, homophonic pla=
y, and poliglot disco-balls. The phrases tease at narrative, then refute it=
, establishing a dizzying surface texture, an experience in reading that re=
wards participation. Sentences swivel at their hinges, or refract at obliqu=
e angles, an effect of rupture reminiscent of William Burrough=E2=80=99s cu=

Poets for Living Waters is a poetry action in response to the BP oil disast=
er in the Gulf of Mexico begun on April 20, 2010, one of the most profound =
human-made ecological catastrophes in history. Former US poet laureate Robe=
rt Pinsky describes the popularity of poetry after 9/11 as a turn away from=
 the disaster=E2=80=99s overwhelming enormity to a more manageable individu=
al scale. As we confront the magnitude of this recent tragedy, such a retur=
n may well aid us.=0A=0A=0A=0AThe first law of ecology states that everythi=
ng is connected to everything else.  An appreciation of this systemic conne=
ctivity suggests a wide range of poetry will offer a meaningful response to=
 the current crisis, including work that harkens back to Hurricane Katrina =
and the ongoing regional effects.=0A=0A=0AThis online periodical is the fir=
st in a planned series of actions.  Further actions will include a print an=
thology and a public reading in Washington DC.=0A=0A=0AIf you would like to=

Dear Jared & Everyone:

still recovering from an operation so am a bit behind on email--though have
followed this the last few days--

"poets for living waters"--

i thought immediately also of another assault on "living waters"--
the Israeli commando attack on a humanitarian aid flotilla in International
Waters--

when the starving people of Somalia, whose coastline for fishing is toxic,
being used as an international waste dump for the powerful--
attack a ship, they are called "pirates"--
their country being of course "linked to terrorism" also in the eyes of the
usa--

of course, when humanitarian aid workers are attacked in international
Waters by state commandos--
they must be "terrorists" too--

the "living waters"--
whose "living waters?"--

think how each day, "living waters," beings, humans, reefs, plants, ways of
life, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, puddles, rain drops--are killed off by
toxic dumping, toxic oil and toxic anti-humanitarianism--

the "living waters" --think on all the "living" and dying waters of the
world--
and of how many ways they are made toxic-

all the poets of the world need "living waters"--

without "living waters" --
for all--
there won't be "living poets"--

nor poems for "living waters"--

that's my non-poem--

In the face of an unprecedented ecological disaster with =

Dear Jared,=0A =0AIn the face of an unprecedented ecological disaster with =
ongoing likely-to-be-global catastrophic consequences, Amy King and I have =
turned to poetry. We have called for people to write poems. Thousands of pe=
ople have done just that, and we have published those poems. We have also c=
alled for people to organize poetry readings. People around the world have =
done just that, and we have too. But 500,000+ gallons of oil a day roil int=
o the Gulf of Mexico choking marshes and bays, with coastlines destroyed an=
d economies wrecked, and in response--poems? You want to know what the poet=
ry will produce. You bring up a reasonable question, and I think you do so =
in a fair enough way. You refrain from personal attack. You feel the same o=
utrage and genuine concern about the escalating disaster, I think, that mos=
t of us feel.=0A =0ALet me decline the opportunity to outline the documente=
d relevance of poetry for therapeutic purposes in grief work or assert the =
need to shape cultural consciousness through the collection of historical d=
ocumentation recording marginalized voices and, instead, explore the possib=
ilities of concurring with your implied accusation. In the effort to stop t=
he slow and pointless and avoidable (though now increasingly unavoidable) d=
eath of a 300 million year old richly diverse ecosystem, a demise perpetrat=
ed by an indifferent, corrupt, and even sinister global power, a death with=
in a larger systemic crisis already underway in the oceans, the Poets for L=
iving Waters project is useless.=0A =0AI embrace this uselessness. It is my=
 only hope. I think the demand that an activity have a use is endemic to th=
e thinking behind our current ecological crisis. The expectation that a poe=
m be of use, that a person be of use, that one's life be of use or have a p=
urpose--is an expression of the assumption that all the rest of the natural=
 world is to be of use. This is basically the =E2=80=98instrumental view=E2=
=80=99 we have inherited from the Greeks and Judeo-Christian thought=E2=80=
=94the instrumental view ecologists pretty much all agree bears fundamental=
 responsibility for this current mass extinction, this heartbreak era of ec=
ocide.=0A =0AAt a candlelight vigil on World Ocean Day, which I attended on=
 the Gulf of Mexico in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, desperate folks talked ab=
out making changes to reduce their carbon footprints=E2=80=94putting timers=
 on their hot water heaters, carpooling, lobbying for clean energy=E2=80=94=
all reasonable enough intentions. But others implied and I would argue the =
problem is, at least partly, much more basic. The problem is located in our=
 assumption of what our lives mean or rather that they mean. We want meanin=
gful lives. We strive for bigger, better, more abundant lives full of evide=
nce that we have in fact been useful, purposeful, day-planner-packed alive,=
 have improved on the lots of our forebearers. In this mode, we=E2=80=99ll =
keep demanding the energy reserves to get us all those important places we =
need to be. And companies will keep drilling to get the energy we buy. What=
 if instead we accept our lives as meaningless? What if we collectively ask=
 how we can be radically
 useless? What if instead of purposeful lives, we simply appreciate, engage=
, value, and insist on shared access to the joy offered by a sensorial conv=
ersation with our fellow transient creatures in a living world?  =0A =0AWe =
are ourselves each a living world. Poetry can teach us this. And it is the =
news without which many die everyday. We are also ourselves each a world us=
ed instrumentally. Poetry can teach us this too. Alice Notley says, =E2=80=
=9CI=E2=80=99m, we=E2=80=99re, the flower of suppression. / Much of one is =
suppressed / towards being another kind of one / other colors, petal arrang=
ements, scents / you can only have one scent.=E2=80=9D I believe Notley is =
describing the way in which we literally embody the forces that quantify an=
d objectify the world, turning natural processes into human products.  =0A =
=0ANotley is describing the way in which our entire mind/body system, inclu=
ding both our conscious and unconscious minds, are shaped for the purposes =
of economic forces.  When we are suppressed, our conscious mind is shut off=
 from our unconscious, in a culture privileging a mode of quantifiably prod=
uctive thought for which we receive wages. Most unconscious material is dro=
wned out while also being reconstituted by a daily torrent of profit motiva=
ted mass media. This torrent keeps us unconsciously motivated to behave in =
ways that produce profits for others. Importantly, our unconscious is most =
exploitable when its processes are kept hidden through their devaluation an=
d through our profound dissociation from sensorial engagement.=0A =0AWe cou=
ld perhaps reclaim our lives from the forces that use them as resources for=
 profit. How much time do we spend consciously conversing with our unconsci=
ous, challenging our mind's collection of profit-motive materials, cultivat=
ing a healthy consciousness?  How often do we bridge the two parts of our m=
inds and our bodies? Generally speaking, I=E2=80=99d guess the majority of =
US citizens simply do not consciously bridge these two parts on a daily bas=
is at all and spend a large chunk of time dissociated from their immediate =
surroudings. Gregory Bateson has described poetry as a bridge between the c=
onscious and unconscious parts of the mind, helping to give voice to our no=
ndirective, nonpurposive modes of thought. What if everyone wasted an hour =
a day writing pointless poems?=0A =0APerhaps it's fair to say that a nonpur=
posive mode needs much more emphasis in order to stop the work ethic and be=
lief in growth that are destroying the planet. Jed Rasula in an interview r=
ecently published in Brenda Iijima=E2=80=99s )((eco(lang(uage) (reader)) pr=
oposes not attempting activism that aims to take down a monolith like BP bu=
t instead thinking of activism as =E2=80=9Ca series of transient occasions.=
=E2=80=9D I like this idea. What I understand Rasula to imply is that our v=
ery embrace of transience is itself activism. I also think he points to a s=
ystemic model of change, suggesting that the local chemical reactions of an=
 event unfold within the larger system, evolving into changes not perceived=
 or foreseen by the individuals local to the event. It=E2=80=99s also a pro=
foundly nonheroic model.=0A =0AI do think we want to examine what sort of s=
ystemic reactions any of our actions might be likely generating. With respe=
ct to the online anthology, these poems seem to be facilitating grief work,=
 and they are arriving in from diverse enough quarters to serve as part of =
the historical record.  But that work is not the purpose of the site. It is=
 a generative outgrowth. The larger project claims to =E2=80=98create venue=
s for poetry in support of healthy ocean communities=E2=80=99. That is a us=
e. The venues function to distribute the poetry. But, to repeat your questi=
on, what does all this poetry produce? Even though I would enjoy and likely=
 learn from exploring how poetry plays a role in the evolution of meaning-m=
aking through the creation of new contexts, I'd rather for the moment agree=
 poetry makes nothing happen. I hope that I=E2=80=99ve suggested that the P=
oets for Living Waters project, in part by its promotion of the useless, is=
 potentially an effective agent for
 change.   =0A =0A All the erring quest,=0A =0AHeidi Lynn Staples=0A=0A=0A =

Jared writes:

*I guess, my question, what will be the actual
produce from
=93poets for living waters?=94  What opportunity
is it truly presenting, or realizing, "for" whom and for what?*

I think these are important questions.  What do we *produce,* what "produce=
"
is "made" by our efforts?  Does it come down to *form*?

Because I also think that what Heidi Lynn Staples implies in her argument
below, especially in her reference to Notley's words, effectively suggests
that "poetry" -- in its most refreshing and opening up -- of the language o=
f
the brain? --  can behave like an organism that resists the current world's
toxicity, in an ironic turning of the physics and matter involved (now
floating in the Gulf of Mexico and perhaps on its way by now up the norther=
n
Atlantic via the Gulf Stream...).

Heidi eloquently writes that all is connected, and (in reference to Notley)=
,
that poetry is perhaps:

*the way in which we literally embody the forces that quantify and objectif=
y
the world, turning natural processes into human products.*

The questioning of use / use value / the capital-corporate model is
important in Heidi's written defense of these Poets / Living Waters
political-poetic events.  Maybe language comes first.  Then, the
corporation.  So -- does it make sense to turn ourselves back to the deep
structure of the language? To renew it, reinvigorate it, with new language,
new thought -- as means to critique the current culture of damage and greed=
?

But do we not, as poets, and or intellectuals, and/or feminists /
environmentalists, too often find ourselves relying upon the same language,
the same principles, that the corporate-style model is the most overt
manifestation of?  --  when we host "events" on behalf of what is
essentially a consciousness-raising effort but it becomes too exclusive
and/or a plug for our own work?  By this, I mean in that we kow-tow to the
designs of hierarchy, the premise of non-inclusion.

I got the call we all got here on Poetics Lists a couple of weeks ago to
volunteer to be involved in this particular NYC event;  I immediately
backchanneled and offered to help. I received no answer back.  I would have
loved to have been involved in any way possible, including arranging
chairs.  But I never heard back.  Perhaps this is just a blip?  Perhaps
everyone else who  backchanneled was responded to?

But I, at least, become a bit concerned when I get the final announcement
replete with poet bios, that the event wasn't created out of a sincere,
truly collective spirit.

Part of the corporate "use" model and promulgated now on Facebook plugs is
plugging one's own career.  We all can use that model -- we live in the
world of "social networking."  But when it comes to the Gulf spill, such a
horrific tragedy and loss of life (non-homo-sapiens sapiens, but perhaps
just at the moment), I agree with Jared:  I wonder what this will
"produce".

To CHANGE that model, we need to reach out -- beyond the comfort of our own
shores.  And our own small tributaries.  Waters expand the globe.  Perhaps
just a call for everyone to show up would be a better way to build a
movement of poets against the war on the environment.  A powerful show-up, =
a
real poetry-protest.

I do believe that poetry -- its reading, its teaching, its writing,
rereading -- can help us do something different, to heal ourselves and our
ways.  But we have to *listen.*

This is my opinion.

Laura,

First, I never saw your email to participate!  I'm sorry, but it did slip through whatever cracks exist.  I did, however, receive a few backchannels of interest that I responded to and added people to the "exclusive" list as they expressed interest to read.  You and I have certainly corresponded in the past, and I'm not sure why, when you didn't receive a reply, you didn't simply send a second email expressing your interest directly to me.  The announcement also was an invitation.  Those who emailed me they were attending were asked to bring something to read.  I didn't receive an email from you yesterday or Monday; only this one after the fact today.

I was away for a week or so prior but was also checking email on my handheld and threw this "exclusive" list together within the last 48 hours based on those who had expressed interest. Again, I really don't understand this idea that if your email went unreplied to, you assumed you were being ignored instead of simply sending out a second query, especially directly to me since we "virtually" know each other and have corresponded numerous times in the past.  You would have been more than welcome to attend, read, organize chairs, hold up signs, heckle, or anything else you felt compelled to do.  I recall even forwarded something to Wompo the other day at your bequest, and yet, you didn't mention being "ignored" when you asked me to do that favor.   No one "owned" this reading, as is being implied - I simply asked and organized.

Heidi spent hours putting together a sheet of suggestions and advice she sent to everyone offering to organize a reading; she also spent hours corresponding online with those volunteers about the tragedy and what she hoped this kind of action might be like.  Last night, I read for two minutes and introduced everyone else, who read for about five to ten minutes.  During and after the reading, we all talked about what is happening, how we feel, what might be done, etc.  It was a gathering, an open gathering.  It felt like such - the tone was in implied as well as overt.  Of course, nothing was resolved (do any poetry readings ever resolve anything??), but we came together, not before our tv screens, but in person; we listened and we talked.  Others in other states, and in the one you and I are in, took the initiative to organize for World Oceans Day (ours was not the only one in NYC yesterday!). No one forbidden; everyone was encouraged.  We parted feeling
 a mix of emotions, which was better than the usual media effect that leaves the majority of us feeling angry and impotent.

As for equating such a gathering and our efforts with the site with perpetuating the capitalist model, I don't get it, and yes, am affected by such criticism.  It feels like a punch in the gut.  Heidi and I are two people reading through submissions for the last two weeks, posting as quickly as we can in between our jobs and family responsibilities.  No work has been rejected.   We are eager and anxious to post as much as possible during our free time.  And we have been on a daily basis, including corresponding with poets sending in work and poets organizing readings elsewhere and announcing their poetry and statements as they go up as best as we can.  We feel honored to do this work and are solidly invested in it.  We are learning.   If others feel like it's not a worthwhile project, they can A) ignore our efforts to give voice and space -- and/or  B) create another action according to their own standards.  No one owns the license to respond to this
 tragedy.  I've always felt if you don't see something done the way you like, why not do it the way you prefer?  I certainly don't rely on the mainstream to give me space and voice; if you see this project that way, why would you?   On my end, I find it worthwhile to put some of my efforts into getting folks' poems into the world, especially in the face of a tragedy like this, and I work towards drawing attention to their efforts.  That's what we're doing, the best way we can at the moment with the resources, energy and time we have.

No one was banned last night from attending any of the readings across the states, and everyone was welcome to honor World Oceans Day as they desired.  Many of us did.  You could have just "shown up," as you note!   Why not?!

As for plugging my own work, I have done so unabashedly and without apology for a long time now in specific poetry venues like listservs, on my own blog, my Facebook page, etc, whether I'm working on a separate project like this, editing a journal (as I'm currently doing times two at the moment), running a reading series, taking care of family, or just teaching my classes (my students are never instructed to read my work -- and when they discover it, I discourage their interest until the semester ends).   Conflating my efforts here with blatant self promotion seems obvious and divisive, at best.  My grandma always encouraged her little southern belle towards modesty ("Pretty is as pretty does"), but I never learned that age old lil' lady lesson and have never apologized for such "selfishness!"

Assuming the worst unfortunately seems to be the default setting in this thread.  If you want a poetry protest, why not join one of the readings last night?  If you see an error, why not offer constructive advice?  What model would you use?  Are you willing to put something together?  Another professor from NYC couldn't attend last night, but wants to organize a reading at her college shortly - you are welcome to do the same!  I'd be happy to attend!  And for future events, we hope you will participate.  If we don't answer the phone, ring again!  For the record, everyone is welcome!!

Best,

Amy

I got the call we all got here on Poetics Lists a couple of weeks ago to
volunteer to be involved in this particular NYC event;  I immediately
backchanneled and offered to help. I received no answer back.  I would have
loved to have been involved in any way possible, including arranging
chairs.  But I never heard back.  Perhaps this is just a blip?  Perhaps
everyone else who  backchanneled was responded to?

But I, at least, become a bit concerned when I get the final announcement
replete with poet bios, that the event wasn't created out of a sincere,
truly collective spirit.

Part of the corporate "use" model and promulgated now on Facebook plugs is
plugging one's own career.  We all can use that model -- we live in the
world of "social networking."  But when it comes to the Gulf spill, such a
horrific tragedy and loss of life (non-homo-sapiens sapiens, but perhaps
just at the moment), I agree with Jared:  I wonder what this will
"produce".

To CHANGE that model, we need to reach out -- beyond the comfort of our own
shores.  And our own small tributaries.  Waters expand the globe.  Perhaps
just a call for everyone to show up would be a better way to build a
movement of poets against the war on the environment.  A powerful show-up, a
real poetry-protest.

Dear Jared,

I appreciate your concern and challenge. =

From Heidi:=0A=0ADear Jared,=0A=0AI appreciate your concern and challenge. =
I would be genuinely interested in considering specific ideas about how to =
make this mobilization of poets in response to the crisis meaningful. I wou=
ld love to consider specific, practical ideas related to the form of events=
, publication of materials, etc. We are striving to have an open, diverse, =
wild space. When considering this request for ideas, please keep in mind th=
at as it stands:=0A=0A1. We publish pretty much everything we receive. Even=
tually!=0A2. We celebrate and support all responses to calls for organizers=
. Anyone who did not hear back probably had their email drop into the ether=
, which has happened to numerous people. Folks send their materials and the=
n for whatever reason, yahoo drops the mail into the nowhere. If you don't =
hear from us PLEASE RESEND! We are very concerned about each person who wri=
tes and appreciative of their interest.=0A3. We are not able to give the pr=
oject the time its urgency would suggest is appropriate. We are volunteers =
with full demanding lives. For example, I'm still getting organized after a=
n international move late last fall, am studying for comprehensive exams in=
 two weeks, and have a three and a half year old and no local family help. =
The site receives around 100 emails a week, which add up really fast. Amy w=
as out of town for a few days. Some days I just need to study or else I'll =
disappear into this disaster and my effort to respond, of which this 'liste=
ning', which is how I understand the site, is a part. In my own self intere=
st, I shouldn't really even be writing this email. But I recognize the vali=
dity of these concerns and am hoping that by pooling together and streaming=
 apart and flowing together again our resources as a poetry community, we c=
an generate many meaningful responses to this crisis.=0A=0AThanks for your =
interest and the seriousness with which you take poetry.=0A=0AAll the very =

Oil, our pasts


Our battles and our contemporaries are doomed, in twenty years,
we will hardly be memories or pioneers.

These animals are instruments of oil, collapsing in the debris
of other lives which had given birth to them.

Hopeless this technology, despair is hopeless, death hopeless,
life hopeless, above all life is hopeless.

Hopeless life must be lived until it is no longer present at
life, hopeless death, in twenty years or among many pasts.

Hopeless the pasts unaccounted for, in ten years who among us
shall meet or come into their own among others already forgotten.

Our worlds are already gone, gone the battles of pasts, gone the
futures, our mouths full of worlds already gone, past lives ...

http://www.alansondheim.org/oil.mov

On this vista the curtain may be drawn. Neither poet nor seer
can look beyond. Nature, who is unconscious in her immorality,
entrancing in her beauty, savage in her cruelty, imperial in her
prodigiality, and appalling in her convulsions, is not only deaf,
but dumb. There is no answer to any appeal. The best we can do,
the best that has ever been done, is to recognize the implaca-
bility of the laws that rule the universe, and contemplate as
calmly as we can the nothingness from which we are come and into
which we shall all disappear. The one consolation that we hold,
though it is one which may be illusory too, consists in the
belief that when death comes, fear and hope are at an end. Then
wonder ceases; the insoluble no longer perplexes; space is lost;
the infinite is blank; the farce is done.*

Their agony, their dying breaths, their inconceivable twisting,
in thirty years, none will remember us among emptied halls, what
suns, what lights, what glories already gone among them

From Heidi in response to Laura:

Dear Laura,

I am so sorry to hear that you requested to help out with the World Ocean Day Action and did not receive a reply. I know there is one note we got late last week about helping out to which we have not yet replied. But I do not even know if it was yours. We have been  pretty swamped with the combination of our own very busy lives beyond the Gulf Coast tragedy and getting this project going. If that note was not yours, then I think your communication got lost in the ether. Yahoo has repeatedly let us down, and it's just another detail we have not yet addressed. I am really genuinely sorry.

This reading action was impromptu and was planned pretty much at the last minute. Would you be interested in creating an action for another day? Perhaps the summer solistice on the 20th or July 4th--calling for the freedom of the world's waters? I am just brainstorming here. Any ideas you have will be welcome. I

Thank you so much for your interest in participating. When you reply, perhaps cc amy and this address--that way we will be sure to get together on this.

And thank you for speaking out. I am really sorry to hear that you have felt let down. But I am glad that we have a chance to redress the complaint and now, hopefully, help bring to fruition your ideas for a transformative response to these frightening painful times.


All the very best wishes,

Heidi

Response to Amy --

Just wanted to put out there that -- with all the wonderful intentions that
you and others have had -- the message you are trying to communicate can
sometimes get lost.  The way an event gets publicized, organized -- again,
the form of the event -- is part of what gets "produced" (going back to
Jared's original e-mail).

I once organized a Poets against the War poetry reading in Harlem, where I
teach.  This was the week Bush 2 bombed Bagdad.  I thought it was a powerful
event.  Some of my students loved it.  Some of my colleagues thought it was
terrible to read poetry at a time like that, and refused to attend.  Or
maybe they were supporting Bush.  (Bottom line: you can never please
everyone when you organize / activate. But -- is the point to please?)

I will say that our flier did not post the names of poets or bios in
star-like format.  It was "come as you are" -- and read. That, for me, was
the power in it.

Maybe these "default" e-mails that go to no real person and the Facebook
style of organization and the invitations with bios -- they might be part of
the failed message.    We are all so busy "networking."  Those lines between
self-promotion and doing the right thing can be misconstrued -- all too
easily.  And this environmental disaster -- how to respond -- *Do we really
know how?*

Maybe we should all go to our rivers and oceans, collectively, and wear a
gag or gas mask -- and NOT speak, as poets.

Amy you do a lot here for us all, and know that you are appreciated.  Thank
you for your openness to this discussion.  You are wonderful, truly.  Maybe
my critique is more one of the era we are in and how we fashion ourselves
and our messages.  It's directed, too, at myself.

[As I've written this note I see a response from Heidi.  The answer is YES.
Let's organize something ... And do it, say, on another river here in NYC.
The Harlem River?  For me, any event will have to be in early September as I
go across the oil-splattered ocean soon, following the Gulf Stream.  No
default e-mails.  Open to all poets, artists.  But ... will people attend?]

Amy and Heidi,

While I understand that poetry, especially in electronic form, cannot
soak up all the oil in the Gulf, I believe that a poetic response to a
crisis, whether environmental, political or military, can have a long
lasting effect.  Just think - we're still reading anti-war poems about
long ago wars.

		Above all I am not concerned with Poetry.

		My subject is War, and the pity of War.

		The Poetry is in the pity.

		Yet these elegies are to this generation in no sense consolatory.
They may be to the next. All a poet can do today is warn. That is why
the true Poets must be truthful.

																													- Wilfred Owen


Nature poetry, of course, has inspired many generations to value our
environment.  Unfortunately the BP execs didn't get that message, but
who knows - maybe their children will.

Regards,

Geer Austin

Owen had credibility, however. He died in the war he wrote about. Our
embrace of him has to do with that. I doubt many of us are willing to lay
down our lives for tarballs.

You should give us a sample. A list of names gives no idea what to

Brenda Hillman is pretty eloquent on all of these matters. It seems to me that we need to demand, now, the equivalent of a Manhattan Project to end the carbon based economy. People familiar with nanotech tell me that the means exist to do this. What does not exist is the will, the commitment, the willingness to be outspoken. This demand should go viral.

Dead people have more credibility than the living?

Certainly they are more conisistent, and it is easier to measure their
political effectiveness.

I am going to a yoga earth healing meditation on Sunday. Through yoga I hav=

s about the Gulf, of course, but I think that we will be meditating on more=
 than that. The horrendous abuse that our earth has endured is something th=
at=A0is hurting=A0all of us.=A0Perhaps if the understanding of the poetry f=

 but I will use that word.) =A0

Exactly. People who sacrifice have more credibility than people who just
talk. It's why Christ was more than a notable teacher.

I think there is all the will in the world to stop polluting the Gulf.
Emotions run high. Solutions,once the oil gets out, are harder to come by.

I think that, at the very least, teaching people to think imaginatively =

us who teach poetry (as well as write it) are presented with a good =

interconnectedness of all these things, and the importance of paying =
attention BEFORE the catastrophe happens.  You may not be able to teach =
someone to actually write poetry (or even appreciate it!), but you can =
communicate the power of using imagination in different situations.  And =
we desperately need to be doing that. =20=

Perhaps I am too idealistic in my replies - please do weigh in if you are so moved:


The Poetry Feminaissance by Travis Nichols

Are you a poet? Do you feel overwhelmed by negativity? Feel like there's no hope for a poet in this world? Especially a female poet? Well don't despair. Spend some time with Amy King. She's the author of Slaves to Do These Things (Blazevox), and, with Ana Bozicevic, she co-curates the Brooklyn-based reading series, The Stain of Poetry, and, maybe most importantly, she has ideas. Over the past few weeks we've been emailing back and forth about her ideas of what it means to be a poet today. Here's a few slices of the force for your perusal. Enjoy.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CThe Ashes of Thoreau=E2=80=
=9D by Chris Mansel.
Description:

Chris Mansel writes like a man without a country. Each poem of =E2=80=9CThe=
 Ashes of Thoreau=E2=80=9D is a labyrinth of fragmentation and resolve. The=
 projection is dense but difficult to abandon. Like cinema, it will leave y=
ou entertained by the time you step back into the light.

 Rockpile Tour Interviews and Feature at The Argotist Online.=20

This feature relates to ROCKPILE a collaboration between poets David Meltze=
r, Michael Rothenberg and Terri Carrion, who travelled through eight cities=
 in the U.S. to perform poetry and prose, composed while on the road, with =
local musicians and artists in each city. ROCKPILE=E2=80=99s main aim was t=
o educate and preserve, as well as to create a history of collaboration. It=
 is hoped that it has helped to reinforce the tradition of the troubadour, =
a tradition that is central to the cultural upheaval and the identity polit=
ics that reawakened poets, artists, musicians and songwriters from the mid-=
1960s through to the 1970s.

Included in this feature is an interview with David Meltzer and Michael Rot=
henberg, an interview with David Meltzer, perspectives from two of the musi=
cians involved (Bob Malone and Daniel McNaughton), some reactions from peop=
le who were either involved or who saw the tour on the road and an overview=
 of the tour by Michael Rothenberg.=20

Subject:      An Announcement from Big Bridge- NO MORE OIL!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear Friends of Big Bridge,

My apologies for writing you all on issues that are not related to Big =
Bridge. But we have come to a moment in our existence as a species in =
which "propriety" is less and less meaningful.=20

As you all know Big Bridge has always been vocal on political and social =
issues and so the time has come for us to speak out against OIL!=20

Many of our friends living in the Gulf Coast are seeing their lives =
destroyed forever. An entire ecosystem appears doomed. The impact is =
global.=20

Everyday it seems more certain that we are witnessing the worst man-made =
environmental holocaust in history and I feel we must be heroic in our =
actions to make something positive out of this horror.=20

Over the last few weeks, I have focused attention to my facebook =
communications, posting as many articles and pieces of information on =
the "spill" as I can, hoping that the spread of information will make a =
difference in how we do things. I have organized three events, =
fundraising benefits for The Louisiana Bucket Brigade, =
http://www.labucketbrigade.org/ , a non profit environmental health and =
justice organization tracking the impact of the BP oil spill and =
prevaenting the impact from being "swept under the rug." Two events in =
Petaluma, June 27(poetry and music fest)  and July 10th (an art =
auction), and another event in Pacifica, CA (poetry and music and art =
auction) on August 7. For details please contact me.=20

It is time to make a real change. Not just leave it to government to =
show us the way. Please, get out in the street, wave signs, write =
friends, spread the word, organize!! We are into a new age. Stop Oil! =
Stop Global Warming! Stop Corporate Ownership of the Planet! There is no =
time left to waste.=20

If you have news that you want to get around please send it to me or =
join me on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/michael.rothenberg. If we =
are not "friends" yet, I would be happy to add you. Again forgive me for =
using Big Bridge mailing list to send this message but I could not hold =
back.

My sincere best in these sad and terrifying times. Hope lies in real =
change not in promises!

Yours,=20

If anyone's had trouble with the website, we've had server problems.

furniturepressbooks.com

But all's well now!

Chris McCreary's "Undone: A Fakebook" and Emily Carr's "Directions for
Flying" are still available (even though we've practically sold out of
the titles already!)

A second printing will of the making soon, so hurry!

              reply-type=original

Inspired by netpoetic.com, which is a group blog on 'electronic literature',
I recently started up a group blog called Netartery at
http://netartery.vispo.com . Which looks a bit like a much earlier project
of mine called Webartery ( http://vispo.com/defib/pastevents.htm ).

There are only a few posts, so far, to Netartery. They're by Gregory
Whitehead, Andy Campbell, Jhave Johnston, and myself. Currently 13 people
have agreed to post at least 6 times per year. That number will probably
increase and decrease and, hopefully, balance out to something steady in
terms of semi-regular posts.

Netartery is like netpoetic in that the reader and writership will consist
probably primarily of writers. But the focus is not so much on 'electronic
writing' as a more general 'writers gone wrong' approach. Gregory Whitehead,
for instance, is an audio writer. I've been following his work since the
80's
and regard him as the best literary audio artist I've encountered.

Jhave Johnston ( http://glia.ca ) and Andy Campbell (
http://dreamingmethods.com ) are also involved. Jhave Johnston is a
Montréal-based poet-programmer who is producing some of  the strongest
contemporary poetic net art (such as http://vispo.com/jhave ). And Andy
Campbell has been producing digital fiction since the early nineties and
continues with his truly outstanding project dreamingmethods.com . The other
people involved (and haven't posted yet) are Chris Joseph, Christina
Ljungberg, Christine Wilks, Jason Quackenbush, Kedrick James, Leonardo
Flores, Marcus Bastos, Michael Harold, and Regina Célia Pinto.

Netartery is primarily a place to post about one's new work and new work of
interest to the group and its readership, and about related issues. New
work, interesting ideas, events, and so on. The people posting to Netartery
are media writers and scholars of media writing. They are 'writers gone
wrong' in this sense. They might write books, but they are also involved in
other forms of artistic writing. These can be vispoetic or performative,
programmerly, audio-oriented, and what not.

*Sunday, June 20, 6 pm at the Bowery Poetry Club* marks the second event of
the *P||R||O||J||E||C||T||I||O||N||S* series, curated by Paolo Javier and
Jeremy J F Thompson. Our series presents an active intersection of moving
text and moving image:

*1. text moving sonically through space*

* 2. image moving on the surface of a screen*

The fundamental scenario presents one or more present persons utilizing
words &/or sounds &/or movement to mediate both spatially and conceptually
between images on a screen and a live audience. Performing this Sunday are:

 *KATE EICHORN*, author of *Fond* (BookThug, 2008) and co-editor of *Prisma=
tic
Publics: Innovative Canadian Women's Poetry and Poetics* (Coach House Books=
,
2009). A second collection of poetry, *Fieldnotes: a forensic*, is
forthcoming in fall 2010 from BookThug. She teaches writing and cultural
theory at The New School.

*DANNY SNELSON*, a writer, editor, and archivist recently acclimated to
Philadelphia. His online editorial work can be found on
UbuWeb<http://www.ubuweb.com/>,
PennSound <http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound>, and Eclipse. He is the
founder of Aphasic Letters <http://www.aphasic-letters.com/> (with Phoebe
Springstubb) and No Input Books <http://www.noinputbooks.com/> (with James

and with free103point9 Transmission Arts <http://www.free103point9.org/>.
Invited lectures at the Sorbonne, Centre Pompidou, &Now SUNY Buffalo,
Princeton University and University of Washinton Bothell. Recent writing
projects include Simultaneously Agitated

*Sunday, June 20
Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery (and Bleecker St)
$6 at the door.
Full bar available.*

Historical practices related to this series: Benshi (Japan), Py=F4nsa (Kore=
a),
Benzi (Taiwan), Gavrilov Translations (USSR), Lector (Poland).

Contemporary practices related to this series: Movietelling, Neo-Benshi,
Voiceover, Redubbing, Gag Dub, Resubtitling.

In the last 5 years, these practices have emerged in clusters throughout th=
e
world, owing in part to practitioners=92 frustrations with the limitations =
of
certain mediums, and in part to the collective social urge to confront and
appropriate the onslaught of information and media that now overwhelms us.

Our hope is that this series might become a hub, an intersection for
practitioners already stretching and breaking the bounds within their own
mediums and communities. We will showcase poets, film-makers, musicians,
performance artists, scholars, critics, editors, and other producers and
managers of meaning and form.
Please come, and do pass along this invitation!

Subject:      Reviewers needed for Dialogue's End (plus) Baltimore Center for
              the Emerging Text announcement
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Good evening,

The Dialogue's End blog (http://dialoguesend.blogspot.com/) is in need
of poetry title reviewers. I began the blog ages ago but cannot
sustain it without help from writers who might need a venue to share
their ideas.

The basic premise of the blog is twofold:

1. Review a (newish) book of poetry
2. Develop a dialogue (interview) with the writer of the book

In the end, one will have created an inter(re)view of the title and the writer.

I'm not sure if something similar has been done before. Perhaps the
two acts could be melded into one?

I'm open to ideas.

Also, this will be part of the Furniture Press Books website, and all
reviewers will have free reign to decide with which titles/writers
they feel it necessary to create a dialogue, and to persue a format
that best suits the task.

We're also developing a project called The Baltimore Center for the
Emerging Text (B-CET), a multi-facted space and resource center which
will include a performance venue, a small press poetry
library/electronic catalogue, resources for small presses, bookmakers,
writers, librarians, students, teachers, DIYers... the list goes on...
Anyone who may be interested in hosting events, workshops, talks,
lectures, please backchannel to furniture.press.books@gmail.com. I
will anounce a general strategic planning meeting in the weeks to
come. Those in Baltimore are urged to come; those outside also, but
your eMails will be equally urged, especially if your ideas bring this
concept to fruition!

In light of that, we're also looking for donations of small and large
press poetry books, chapbooks, pamlphets, zines, ephemera, incunabula
for our library. The central aspect of the Center is to develop
creative literacy skills beyond our status quo, unfortunately lacking
education in the poetic arts!

Thanks!

Christophe

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear Jared & Everyone:

still recovering from an operation so am a bit behind on email--though have
followed this the last few days--

i am sending a longer version of a question written last week--

might one not ask--
as some have--

whose "living waters"?--
are poets to write about--
wondering, with others,--is the attention to be on the poets?
rather than the "living waters"?--
is this a form of privatized therapy, self help--
carried out in public, dramatized "in real time"--
narcissistic adventures, poses, spoken parts--?
"feeling good about oneself"  for writing re "living waters" . . .
while "living waters" go on dying--

are the "living waters" exclusive? limited to just one area of "living
waters"?--
are the "living waters" being exploited?--
for the therapeutic or career values?--
for the "show"--

for sheer accumulation--huge quantities--of poems--piling up--
to "balance the scales"--scales of justice--scales of weights measures
values--
fish scales--?--

will the poems do Freud's "work of mourning"---
will the poems function like Reagan's "trickle down economy"--
poem tears and waters trickling down through time to touch --someone--

"poets for living waters"--

are their poets for another assault on "living waters"--
the Israeli commando attack on a humanitarian aid flotilla in International
Waters--

are therer poets for the starving people of Somalia, whose coastline for
fishing is toxic, being used as an international waste dump for the powerful
nations--computer dumps--leaking toxins--
when the starving attack a ship, they are called "pirates"--
"terrorists"--their country being of course "linked to terrorism" in the
eyes of the usa--


of course, when humanitarian aid workers are attacked in international
Waters by state commandos--
they must be "terrorists" too--

the "living waters"--
whose "living waters?"--

"the living waters" running through Southwestern  Indian rezervations,
seeping into the soil for decades--toxic from mining, toxic with
radioactivity from atomic tests long ago--

"living waters" along the lower Mississippi River--made toxic by chemical
wastes dumped in areas where the poorest people live--

"living waters" around Chernobyl, Three Mile Island--producing Ukrainian
deformed children--kids with strange complaints near Three Mile island--

"living waters"--tap water-- having to be paid for by communities, their
being owned by private corporations--in the USA--and not long ago in
Bolivia--

think how each day, "living waters," beings, humans, reefs, plants, ways of
life, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, puddles, rain drops--are killed off by
toxic dumping, toxic oil and toxic anti-humanitarianism--the toxins
deliberately dumped on Indian lands--

the "living waters" of Gaza which are 93% polluted, raw sewage running in
the streets, due to deliberate bombing--due to siege--no parts of any kind
allowed in to repair anything-

whose "living waters"--entire coastline of Lebanon polluted, toxic for
hundreds of years due to targeted "smart"  bombing of sewage and chemical
plants--

whose "living waters?"--the waters of Iraq--rendered toxic, killing 500,000
children in the 1990's--shocked and awed all over again--since
2003--continually pounded water mains--toxic, polluted, undrinkable--

toxic waters in China, India, the Amazon . . . Alaska--

the "living waters" --think on all the "living" and dying waters of the
world--
and of how many ways they are made toxic-

all the poets of the world need "living waters"--

without "living waters" --
for all--
there won't be "living poets"--

nor poems for "living waters"--

that's my non-poem--

(Please distribute this call for work to all your colleagues, peers,
students and associates)

Calling all poets from Baltimore City/County...

I'm developing an audio a/onthology (blog, perhaps) associated with
the Furniture Press website and as a sister project of the Dialogue's
End inter(re)views project. This big county/city is thriving with
multifarious poetry projects and I want to document everything that's
happening here (as far as one person can). In light of this, and I
don't think this is a secret, but the Baltimore Historical Society is
collecting works of poetry, in all formats, by Baltimore City poets.
My project has no direct correlation to this collection process, but
it is parallel. So...

What will it entail? I'll be recording individual poets reading from
their books, or manuscripts, at the Towson Arts Collective in Towson,
or at a location that is suitable for the poet.

I'll consider these three platforms:

1. I'll set up an evening where a group of poets can meet for a small,
intimate reading session. I'll capture their (short) readings (about 5
minutes), then digitize the readings in mp3 or wav format, then add to
the website (with bio, of course).

2. I'll set up a meeting with individual poets where they feel most
comfortable reading. I understand some folks can't travel because of
medical/physical circumstances. No one will be left out of this
project.

3. You can send me a clean 5-minute reading of your poems (in mp3 or
wav format) to:

Furniture Press Books
406 York Rd. (lower level)
Towson, MD 21204

Cheers,
Christophe Casamassima

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is NEOLIPIC by John M. Bennett.

Description:

158 poems (or barely constrained outbursts) written in the Spring of 2009 in which John M. Bennett tries to reformat the world with a swarm of linguistic distortions and formal jiggling, bursting out of the thin shirt of consciousness to reveal what's out there and also what's in there. The poems are textual, visual, aural, multi-lingual (English, Spanish, - or their simulacra - and bits of French and Globbolalia). Unlike anything else written.


Available as a free ebook here:

This Noh play by poet Leslie Scalapino travels between the left and right
sides of the brain, with appearances by a reincarnated Patty Hearst in the
1974 SLA bank heist and a green-winged creature that is part crocodile, par=
t
Michelin man and part charging rhino. The play is performed by The
Relationship, a performance group directed by Fiona Templeton that
specializes in innovative language and use of site.

Leslie Scalapino is the ground-breaking, genre-stretching author of thirty
books of poetry, poem-plays, essays, and fiction, including way, which won
the American Book Award; Sight, a collaboration with Lyn Hejinian; Zither &
Autobiography; The Tango; New Time; and It=B9s go in horizontal: Selected

Slack Buddha is happy to announce this season=92s new La Perruque chapbooks=
:

Sonnagrams 1-20 by K. Silem Mohammad
    The first installment of K. Silem Mohammad's anagrammatic manipulations=
 of Shakespeare that tell us, among other things, that "Richard Nixon screw=
ed a giant squid," and that there is "a word the OED omits," and "Whoever s=
ays it retches, dies, and shits." This one's a killer!=20

Ladybug Laws by Laura Moriarty
    An imagined society of Ladybugs, you and I--Moriarty takes us into the =
realm of the possible where language and civil disobedience are both games =
to be played for real. "Some writers to their readers are as spiders / But =
you to me as reader are insectivore / Or creature of paradise".

Market Freakout by Stan Apps
    Poetry is like the forces of the market. Adjustment of the forces is li=
ke being in love with "Santheripean Kingdies." Apps takes us on a poly-voca=
l exploration of the realities of a world run by Wall Street.

Alphabet Man by A. J. Patrick Liszkiewicz
    The concrete poems in this volume are produced using all of the letters=
 of the alphabet each exactly one time. Clean, provocative, and almost scul=
ptural, Liszkiewicz plays with a very plastic conception of language. A mus=
t for those interested in the visual use of the letter.

"Tebot Bach welcomes poets Nicholas Karavatos & Kim Noriega to Golden West =
College."
=20
NICHOLAS KARAVATOS is included in the anthology *Punk Rock Saved My Ass* (U=
kiah: Medusa=92s Muse=2C 2010) and the latest issue of *West Wind Review* (=
University of Southern Oregon=2C 2010). In December 2009=2C Amendment Nine =
published his first book titled *No Asylum* (Arcata=2C 2009).
=20
David Meltzer wrote on the back cover: =93Nicholas Karavatos is a poet of g=
reat range and clarity. This book is an amazing collectanea of smart sharp =
political poetry in tandem with astute and tender love lyrics. All of it vo=
iced with an impressive singularity.=94
=20
Nicholas Karavatos lives near Dubai=2C teaching at the American University =
of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Previously he taught in Muscat=2C S=
ultanate of Oman. He is a graduate of New College of California and Humbold=
t State University.=20
=20
KIM NORIEGA grew up in a suburb of Cleveland=2C Ohio=2C but in her late 20'=
s bought a brand new Camaro=2C and -- with her five-year-old (beautiful!) d=
aughter in tow -- drove "as far south and west" as possible without leaving=
 the country -- to San Diego to be exact -- where they danced together on t=
he beach singing Pretenders' songs and made angels of sand instead of snow.
=20
Now that her daughter is grown=2C Kim spends her time (when not writing) pu=
tting her books in order according to the Dewey Decimal Number Classificati=
on System (mostly 800s) and thinking of crafts to make for her day job with=
 her family literacy kids using yogurt containers. Kim's favorite flower is=
 the lilac (closely followed by wild violets and black tulips) and her favo=
rite color is red -- which is why she wore a red lace wedding gown when she=
 married her beloved=2C Ernie.
=20
Kim=92s poem Heaven=2C 1963=2C first published in Tebot Bach's Blue Arc Wes=
t: Anthology of California Poets=2C was featured by former U.S. Poet Laurea=
te=2C Ted Kooser=2C in his nationally syndicated column=2C American Life in=
 Poetry. The title poem of her first book=2C Name Me=2C recently published =
by Fortunate Daughter Press=2C was a finalist for the 2009 Joy Harjo prize.

EOAGH Reading Series:

Michael Gottlieb and Susie Timmons



***Faux | Other Book Launch***

celebrating the publication of new books from Faux|Other



Sunday, June 20 at 4PM

at Unnameable Books,

600 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY

FREE





MICHAEL GOTTLIEB is the author of fourteen books including The Likes Of Us,
Lost And Found, Gorgeous Plunge, The River Road and New York. In the 1970s
he helped edit the magazine Roof. His new book Memoir and Essay from
Faux|Other makes available two recent prose works by Gottlieb: "The Empire
City" is a moving, eloquent, funny memoir focusing on the early days of
Language Poetry - the personalities as well as the work. It also brings to
life New York in the 1970s, that grim, foreboding, thrilling place, and what
it meant to come of age as a writer then and there. An accompanying essay,
"Jobs Of The Poets," asks two questions: what is the job of the poet, and
what kind of jobs do poets have to take, so they can do their real job.



Read Gottlieb's review of Lydia Davis' Proust translation in EOAGH 4:

http://chax.org/eoagh/issuefour/gottlieb.html

Paint, from Faux/Other.



Poems by Timmons are forthcoming in EOAGH.

Boog City 64: Gay Pride Issue 2010

A quick thanks to all of our editors and their contributors for acting =20=

so quickly and to alter their sections on a dime to enable us to get =20
out this solid Gay Pride issue. I'm real grateful.


featuring:

***On the Cover***

There=E2=80=99s a Riot Going On: Martin Boyce Remembers Stonewall and =
Gay =20
Life Before AIDS, interview by Nathaniel Siegel


**And from our poetry section, edited by Joanna Fuhrman**
   (excerpt below)

=E2=80=94Fort Greene, Brooklyn's Julian Brolaski
with Sea Aloe Song
	Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
				-Shakespeare, Sonnet 8.2

Stellar sea cows, svelte manatees embrace
And lob their salty aloes each to each
While we graze greenly on the filtered rays
Fanned from their froth.  I beg for you to teach
Me all the ways the Romans fucked, and how
Juventius, with honeyed eyes, would sit
In Catulle=E2=80=99s lap, and lick his salty brow.

and

fools act so hard

what, for a fool to act so hard
saying no they will go get the wine
leaving notes around like
=E2=80=9Clet cash be earned while you=E2=80=99re sleeping or cruising=E2=80=
=9D


=E2=80=94Huntington, N.Y.'s Ana Bo=C5=BEi=C4=8Devi=C4=87
with Live a Little
Turn the music on, any music.
We=E2=80=99re doing this like a school play.
First, you=E2=80=99re born in a position of looseness: everyone, stand =
in the =20
same position!
Hands down your sides, head-loll round:
that=E2=80=99s how you do =E2=80=9Cyou.=E2=80=9D OK, next, =
=E2=80=9Creligion=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94
What=E2=80=99s the basis of this one?  Rigidity.


=E2=80=94Chelsea's Bill Kushner
with Lili Marlene

These streets, these rooms, these soldiers.
One guy plays from a dusty accordion, what
a gloomy old place.  No one dances.  I sit
on a bench.  In a moment, I will ask him,
Gunther, to dance with me.  There are no
women left for us, so why not dance, he and
I together, to Lili Marlene?

and

Mason

Mason, of course, drops to his knees, while
Kurt, of course, mutters something about never
all while standing on one leg like a pink flamingo
looking for love online.  Does he have a huge thingo
for Mr. Postman, or is it hey hey just us?  Looking
like the cat that just swallowed the canary, Kevin,
you know him, comes in and comes in and comes in.


**the re-launch of our small press section, now headed by Douglas =20
Manson**

=E2=80=94"The idea that a gay book is not just a keyhole into the hidden =
=20
world of queerness, but a keyhole into the hidden world of men, is =20
something that I have wanted in gay writing ever since I was a kid." =20
from The Keyhole or the Gate: Rainbow Book Fair Organizer Perry Brass =20=

on The Queer Lit Expansion; Straw Gate Books


**from our printed matter section, edited by Arlo Quint**

=E2=80=94"The poems of The Tolerance Project swerve from meta-chat on =20=

violence and feminism and gay dogs, to fragments in a Big-Brother =20
manual discussing the necessary containment of hope." from The =20
Tolerance Project Redefines M.F.A. by Ana Bo=C5=BEi=C4=8Devi=C4=87


**"It was =E2=80=A6 a great surprise to find that the bar patrons, =
Village =20
Voice reporters, and even the cop who led the charge could speak about =20=

the dramatic unfolding of events in such vivid, heartfelt terms, as if =20=

those nights of 1969 were yesterday." from Beyond Drag-Queen Heroics: =20=

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The following is from the announcement for my latest book, Concealments =
and Caprichos, from Black Widow Press in Cambridge:

"Combining two series of poems written since the turn of the century, A =
Book of Concealments and 50 Caprichos after Goya, Rothenberg's latest =
volume is a two-pronged follow-up to his earlier hundred-poem work, A =
Book of Witness, with some notable changes in strategy & composition.

"As Rothenberg states in his pre-face: 'In A Book of Witness I was =
concentrating on the rescue of the first-person voice as our principal =
instrument of witness - not only the personal "I" but the possibilities =
of a real if sometimes fictive "I" across a range of experiences, my own =
& at choice moments those of others. ... By contrast the poems in A Book =
of Concealments suppress or conceal the witnessing "I" but draw from =
more distant "romantic" predecessors & from my own accumulated works by =
collaging as italicized inserts small fragments of poems already written =
& published, while 50 Caprichos, written simultaneously, compensates for =
the largely missing "I" by allowing a give-&-take responsive to the =
dance of images in Goya's early opening to states of spirit & mind that =
many of us would later come to share. ... The writing of these poems at =
a time of new wars & new dissimulations - a notable change since the =
writing of A Book of Witness - is another circumstance not to be =
ignored.'"

The book should be available by now in the usual places.

downtown Ithaca, NY). This reading is free and open to the public.

Carolina Wren Press. She wrote a dissertation on poetry and science at
Cornell University and received her MFA from the University of Iowa.

ADMISSION: $20 / $15 for students



On June 23, a group of musicians will gather at the Jazz Showcase to
celebrate the life and music of Charles Mingus, and to benefit the Les
Turner ALS Foundation. Mingus, an American musical hero who died of ALS, is
one of the greatest figures in jazz history. His bass playing, compositions
and philosophy have transcended his genre and left indelible marks on music
history.



MAPtet will perform music by Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Billy
Strayhorn, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and Eric Dolphy, and Jon Hey --

      Jon Hey -- piano

      Paul Hartsaw -- tenor saxophone

      Dan Godston -- trumpet

      Fred Jackson -- alto saxophone

      Jon Godston -- soprano saxophone

      Raphael Crawford -- trombone

      Tom Berg -- baritone saxophone

      Cory Biggerstaff -- upright bass

      Brian Jones -- drums



We will be performing the following compositions by Charles Mingus -- "Jelly
Roll," "Peggy's Blue Skylight," "Ecclusiastics," "Better Get Hit in Your
Soul," "Fables of Faubus," "Reincarnation of a Lovebird," "Goodbye Porkpie
Hat," "Haitian Fight Song," "E's Flat, Ah's Flat Too," and "Nostalgia in
Times Square." We will also perform "Fleurette Africaine" by Duke Ellington,
"Portrait of Those Beautiful Ladies" by Rahsaan Roland Kirk, "Isfahan" by
Billy Strayhorn, "Gazzelloni" by Eric Dolphy, and "Charlies' Arch Isle" by
Jon Hey.



Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a raffle to win items
donated by Sue Graham Mingus, Myopic Books, Reckless Records, Dusty Groove
America, Peterson Picture Frame Co., and other individuals and
organizations. All proceeds will go to benefit the Les Turner ALS
Foundation.



Mingus Awareness Project is organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective, in
partnership with the Les Turner ALS Foundation. The Borderbend Arts
Collective is a 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to promote the arts,
to create opportunities for artists to explore new directions in and between
art forms, and to engage the community.



Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease
for the New York Yankees baseball icon, is a progressive neuromuscular
disorder that causes atrophy throughout the body, ultimately leading to
total paralysis. Brain cells cease sending messages to muscles, which slowly
prohibits patients' movement and their ability to communicate. Onset
commonly occurs between ages 35 to 65, and is slightly more prevalent in
men. There is currently no cure for ALS, but treatment and interventions can
help alleviate some symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival
by delaying respiratory failure. The clinical progression can vary widely;
however, patients typically live with the disease two to five years after
the onset of symptoms. ALS knows no racial, cultural or socioeconomic
boundaries and follows no pattern.



The Les Turner ALS Foundation, founded in 1977 is recognized internationally
and is the only independent publicly supported non-profit organization in
the Chicago area devoted solely to the treatment and elimination of ALS. The
Foundation is affiliated with Northwestern University Feinberg School of
Medicine where it supports a large multidisciplinary clinical program and
two world-class scientific research laboratories.  The Foundation's
comprehensive patient services include support group meetings, professional
in-home consultation services, communications and durable medical equipment
programs, respite care grants, and educational programs.

Ambit, a journal of temporary and unstable poetics.

Ambit will not elaborate upon a few disparate poems that lack
contiguity. Rather, Ambit is a journal that emphasizes the liesurely
expansion of an idea, an expansiveness that muddles time and space
over the course of space and time. Simply, Ambit is a host to the
serialized poem, the long poem.

"Poem," of course, is an open idea. Visual elements are also welcome,
as well as...

Each issue of Ambit will appear as a downloadable PDF, and will
feature the work of 9 writers.

Each issue of Ambit will also feature the work of one artist, who will
design the cover art.

To engage in a discussion of length seems inappropiate. Send your work
to furniture.press.books@gmail.com, but please follow a few, simple
guidelines so that we do not lose your submission in the aether.

1. Please follow this format in your subject line: name/title of
work/"Ambit Submission"

1a. If you are submitting artwork for the cover, follow the same
format as above, but write "Ambit Cover Submission" instead.

2. Send work as a Word attachment. PDF is also welcome.

3. Add a short cover letter and bio.

4. Allow up to 30 days for reply.

In the event that electronic submissions are impossible, we'd be glad
to see it come across the USPS. Remember to add all relevant
information, and follow this format when sending:

Furniture Press Books/Ambit Submission, 406 York Rd. (lower level),
Towson, MD 21204.

All work that does not follow these guidelines will be used to
decorate the walls of our office.

REMEMBERING PETER SEATON

Just having returned last night from Leslie Scalapino's memorial at St. Mar=
ks - a packed, hot, long, fraught, draining event - one that I have to admi=
t I had to leave halfway through. So many people there, so many people for =
whom Leslie was so important. Old, young - so many young people. She did so=
 much for so many, was such an exemplar, mentor, publisher, friend...  And =
then the next day, today, this news: Peter Seaton, dead.

And who is going to organize his memorial? Just how many remember him, how =
many remember how powerful, unflinchingly, unerringly, nakedly vital was hi=
s work when he burst among us, how many years ago?

I don't have his books in front of me now, and I don't have the years -  th=
e timeline called up - to fix him in our greater calendar but suddenly he w=
as there one season: slight, sandy hair, a pack of... of Camels? Luckies? i=
n his breast pocket. Bespectacled, a perpetual, canted, slightly sardonic s=
mile on his face.

One book, two books, three, maybe there were four, and then he was gone.  H=
e threw himself out of our world, not - at first - going altogether all tha=
t far. Off to Coliseum Books in Midtown Manhattan - where he worked for yea=
rs and where quite apparently he made another life for himself; and made an=
other life with a life partner who we also knew, at least for awhile. But t=
hen what happened?

He reappeared a few years later, read again at the Ear and was just as powe=
rful as ever and it was as if he'd never left - which was a little troublin=
g in a way because, and I'm guessing I'm not the only one who thought so - =
enough years had gone by that it wasn't unreasonable to expect that things,=
 he, his work, might be a bit different, but no. It was all the same.

Then he was gone, again. And it was clear, it was as clear then as it had b=
een clear from the beginning, in the very same way that it remained clear o=
ver the years as Peter came to mind, as his name came up in conversation fr=
om time to time, that Peter could have, maybe should have, been someone who=
se name was always on the tip of all of our tongues. That he could have bee=
n someone whose books were bought, whose writing was taught (is it?  Does a=
nyone teach it now?), he and his poems could have been, should have been th=
e subject of seminars and conferences but for whatever reason - he bailed..=
. he didn't want to live the life, he couldn't deal with the requirements t=
he... the what?  The compromises, the blandishments? Whatever. So he took a=
 walk.

And that act in itself was a kind of admonishment to the rest of us. A caut=
ion and a remonstrance reminding us, recalling to mind - if we needed any r=
eminder - of all the compromises that we have made, we make every day in th=
e name of our careers.  He wouldn't, I guess, he couldn't.

Pearl Pirie's "over my dead corpus"  is a feast=20
of sounds, playful and thoughtful poems culled=20
from the corpus of the world. "The main source=20
corpus is over 500 pages of scrap notes that=20
served as fodder for recombinance. Words or=20
phrases were scraped for letter sequences within=20
syllable or that broke across syllable or word.=20
The other corpus is incidental word combinations=20
from scrabble strung in the mind's insistence for=20
meaning or sound." Pearl Pirie

"Home is a series of recollections, of distances,=20
as easily remembered as mis-remembered, and a=20
blending of events that can sometimes never be=20
confirmed. =85And why write as a "memoir" instead=20
of calling them "prose poems"? I want these=20
stories not to be misunderstood; I want them to=20
be seen as what I remember, what I believe to be=20
true, from my vantage point of some three decades=20
later, and thousands of miles. It felt like=20
reclaiming something that had been far away for a=20
very long time, but no longer. It felt like=20
bringing out the good out from underneath all the=20
bad that came later, overshadowing so much of=20
what had happened before." rob mclennan
$5; Limited Edition of 50 copies. ISBN: 978-0-9783780-7-3

if you are in Ottawa, please attend the launch of=20

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "An Archeology of Theory" by Peter Ganick.
Description:
What is a text? After John Coltrane's "wall of sound", we have here a "wall of text". What does making sense entail? Is it in the words themselves and/or the sequence of words? In "An Archeology of Theory", Peter Ganick suggests both and neither in true spatial reference. Energy is space is a version here-to-be-read.

I received an email from Ron Silliman telling me that Peter Seaton died las=
t
month.

Peter Seaton and I met at City College (CCNY) in 1960 or 1961, when we were
freshmen or sophomores. He was probably born in 1942. We spent many, many
fascinating hours together discussing literature and reading each others
writing throughout our college years. Peter was a terrific marathon
one-on-one conversationalist, a mordant, literary wit of the Holden
Caulfield variety, an indefatigable reader who loved to endlessly talk and
search for books and new ideas. This, combined with the fact that he was
among the most private and secretive persons I have ever known, added
immeasurably to the quality of mystery that surrounded both his presence an=
d
his absence.  One of his early short stories was of a character obsessed
with going out into the city on an inexplicable, lonely search for a certai=
n
hard to find poster.  Our interests and directions concerning poetry and
poetics remained parallel after graduation in 1964, often attending reading=
s
together at St Mark=B9s, reading The World magazine and other poetry magazine=
s
and discussing them avidly, through to the establishment of This magazine,
and L=3DA magazine, up to the early 80=B9s. During the opening and middle years
of Language poetry many of Peter Seaton=B9s long prose poems were published,
widely read and influential. Peter and I did some writing collaborations an=
d
even some film experiments together in the late 60=B9s and early 70=B9s (we wer=
e
then both big fans of Stan Brakhage) although these may now be lost or hard
to locate. I may still have one or two letters or postcards that he wrote t=
o
me when I was living for awhile in Italy and Morocco in the late 60=B9s. It
was he that told me that Bernadette Mayer, whose work we both greatly
admired, was giving an open workshop at the Poetry Project in 1973. He
always encouraged me in my writing and collage productions particularly,
explaining to me that he was knowledgeable about this because his mother ha=
d
once run an art gallery. I am sorry to say that we lost touch with each
other in the early 80=B9s. Peter=B9s writing and poetry and his penetrating
insights into poetry, culture, technology, language and life were of
constant interest to me during our many years of close friendship in the
60's and 70's.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "Experimental Sex Hospital" by Todd S=
wift.
=20
Description:=20
=20
Todd Swift=E2=80=99s "Experimental Sex Hospital" is the ebook sequel to his=
 critically acclaimed, "Mainstream Love Hotel". Shadowing that previous wor=
k, the poems here deepen and lengthen the poet's exploration of desire and =
devotion, and, aesthetically, the tension between innovation and tradition =
in contemporary poetic styles. As in all Swift's work, musicality, sense of=
 form, and wordplay fuse with elevated and street-level tones that create a=
 zany, risk-taking book-text that interrogates ideas of self-identity and p=
oetics, with an earnest eroticism. Barely literature, or literally bare, th=
ese are poems that enjoy walking naked with a flamboyant display.

I received an email from Ron Silliman telling me that Peter Seaton died las=
t
month.

Peter Seaton and I met at City College (CCNY) in 1960 or 1961, when we were
freshmen or sophomores. He was probably born in 1942. We spent many, many
fascinating hours together discussing literature and reading each others
writing throughout our college days. Peter's appearance changed little over
the years. He had short, close cropped light brown curly hair, which later
became gray. He wore glasses, frequently sunglasses or glasses with clear
plastic frames through which you could invariably observe twinkling eyes,
often a dark brown henley t-shirt and light tan corduroys, and though short
in stature he had a distinctive walk, a rolling gait that sometimes reminde=
d
me of a sailor. Peter was a terrific marathon one-on-one conversationalist,
a mordant, literary wit of the Holden Caulfield variety, an indefatigable
reader who loved to endlessly talk and search for books and new ideas. This=
,
combined with the fact that he was among the most private and secretive
persons I have ever known, added immeasurably to the quality of mystery tha=
t
surrounded both his presence and his absence. Other than the fact that he
attended boarding school, he spoke little about his early life.  One of his
first short stories, perhaps written for a short story class that we
attended together at CCNY, was of a character obsessed with going out into
the city on an inexplicable, lonely search for a certain hard to find
poster.  Our interests and directions concerning poetry and poetics remaine=
d
parallel after graduation in 1964, often attending readings together at St
Mark=B9s, reading The World magazine and other poetry magazines and discussin=
g
them avidly, through to the establishment of This magazine, and L=3DA
magazine, up to the early 80=B9s. During the opening and middle years of
Language poetry many of Peter Seaton=B9s long prose poems were published,
widely read and influential. Peter and I did some writing collaborations an=
d
even some film experiments together in the late 60=B9s and early 70=B9s (we wer=
e
then both big fans of Stan Brakhage) although these may now be lost or hard
to locate. I may still have one or two letters or postcards that he wrote t=
o
me when I was living for awhile in Italy and Morocco in the late 60=B9s. It
was he that told me that Bernadette Mayer, whose work we both greatly
admired, was giving an open workshop at the Poetry Project in 1973. He
always encouraged me in my writing and collage productions particularly,
explaining to me that he was knowledgeable about this because his mother ha=
d
once run an art gallery. I am sorry to say that we lost touch with each
other in the early 80=B9s. Peter=B9s writing and poetry and his penetrating
insights into poetry, culture, technology, language and life were of
constant interest to me during our many years of close friendship in the
60's and 70's.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "Sparagmos Never Mind the Via Negativa" by Jim Leftwich.

Description:
The word is flesh. Tear it apart, syllable by syllable. Tear the syllables apart, letter by letter. There is no longer any need to begin with the word. We have already torn the letters apart. The word made flesh, theletters made noise... Eat it - raw. Jim Leftwich's "Sparagmos Never Mind the Via Negativa" was written in May 2010 using a Logitech EX 100 keyboard. It is a text, but it is not a text about reading.
Available as a free ebook here:

Rachel,

Sexton was my teacher that year at Boston U. Much to say.

George Starbuck had left Iowa to become the head of creative writing at BU.
I think he hired Anne. And John Malcolm Brinnin, Dylan Thomas' road manager,
who wrote a wonderful bio of Stein taught in the program, too. He brought
Octavio Paz to our class.

Alberto de Lacerda, the Portuguese poet, came to BU also & gave a course on
Portuguese & Brazilian poets, some of whom he had known.

Don't know if any of this is of interest but here it is.

Ruth

I would certainly include the publication of Watten and Grenier's THIS

I believe the first issue of Shocks magazine appears in 1971 which included=
 probably the first ever printed review of a reading by the late Pedro Piet=
ri here in San Francisco.=20
You should also check out the publications of the various women's presses i=
n the Bay Area - which published Alta, Judy Grahn and Susan Griffin about t=
his time.=A0 This was the 'break ground' moment of diversity (gender, racia=
l) in new American writing (let alone issues of (anti)war, ecology, prisons=
, et al). (I suspect this=A0 happened in the Bay Area because it is a relat=
ively "porous" cross talking region, and not as divided (ghettoized)=A0 as =
then was New York or Chicago=A0 How all of these movements do or do not (& =
why not) get embraced in the formal/critical considerations of "This" and "=
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E" is, I suspect, a critical enigma much worth examining, and=
 maybe some folks have or are doing that (??).=A0=20

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

On Tuesday June 29 I'll be posting on Poems and Poetics the first =
installment of a three part essay by David Antin on narrative, a topic =
of ongoing concern to Antin, which he addresses in his =
characteristically sharp and often surprising way.

Other recent postings include Andrew Schelling, Poems from "The =
ArapahoSongbook"; Mark Weiss: Six Cuban Poets from The Whole Island: =
Robert Duncan's charting of "a symposium of the whole," a key to my own =
discussions of ethnopoetics & related matters; and a further installment =
of Outsider Poems, a Mini-Anthology in Progress, this one a series of =
"Irish Traveller Narratives from Johnny Cassidy's Tellings."

I expect to send out announcements of future postings -- my own and =
others -- which have now been scheduled and cued until early or middle =
September.

And in the meantime suggestions for additions to the anthology of =
outsider and subaltern poetry continue to be welcomed.

I should have checked the source, but in my panic, I did not.  The story is not on the AP at all.  I hope that this is just a mere sensationalized story (god do I) with no validity, whatsoever.

With possible gleeful (& tail-tucking) apologies,

Just when we thought the "spill" couldn't get worse - http://www.huliq.com/9990/ocean-floor-gulf-mexico-verge-collapsing

Excerpt:

BP CUT CORNERS

"The cracks on the ocean floor are the direct result of the single string casing used by BP and the failure to apply proper cementing bond logs in addition to only using 6 centralizers instead of the recommended 21."

Welcome, newly-possible 150,000 barrels of oil a day!  Thanks, BP!

In 1971, I left Germany where I was because of Vietnam era military service.
I brought back with me a love for Olson and Zukofsky. I had picked up Z. at
a bookstore in Covent Garden. My special love was Basil Bunting. My buddy
had studied with Kenner in Santa Barbara and could recite "Brigg Flats" by
heart. That wowed me and fit with my Anglo-Saxon Studies agenda. It was Old
English that drew me to Oregon. Contemporary poetry for me began there with
Galway Kinnell and Robert Creeley and necessarily William Stafford whose son
was a classmate. Donald Davey came up and promoted Ed Dorn and Thom Gunn.
Ralph Salisbury was a poet and a friend. Some of you may know the inimitable
Joe Smith whom I later published in O.ARS. I have written a history of my
associations with Charles Olson and people like Harvey Brown which is
available on the web at
http://www.cranberryisles.com/photos/olson_tangents.htm.

Well=2C I think THAT pretty much covers it.  Thank you=2C Kevin!

One question: is the title of the Adrienne Rich work you're thinking of The=
 Will to Change (shades of Olson) or Diving into the Wreck?

All Best=2C

He was 73.=20




The cause was complications of multiple sclerosis=2C his daughter Emma=20
Snowdon-Jones said.=20

Mr. Sonnenberg funneled the proceeds from the sale of his father=92s=20
five-story town house on Gramercy Park into Grand Street=2C a journal conce=
ived in=20
the spirit of high-minded but nonacademic magazines like The Dial and Horiz=

for nine years=2C working out of the dining room of his apartment on Rivers=
ide=20
Drive=2C until health problems forced him to sell the magazine in 1990. It =
ceased=20

=93I thought a magazine would be a good way to give money to=20
individuals whose writing I liked=2C=94 he told Newsday in 1989. =93I wante=

intellectual talk of both politics and art=2C of sex as well as money.=94 A=
 dandy=2C=20
boulevardier and self-educated litterateur=2C Mr. Sonnenberg consulted only=
 his=20
own taste=2C backing it with substantial paychecks to his writers=2C some w=
ell known=20
and others not. Grand Street was the first to publish the short stories of=
=20
Susan Minot=2C for example=2C whom Mr.=20
Sonnenberg hired to work at the magazine.=20

=93It was his work of art=2C in a way=2C=94 Ms. Minot said in a telephone=20

The first issue of Grand Street =97 named after the street on the Lower=20

poems by Ted Hughes=2C Alice Munro=2C James Salter=2C John Hollander=2C Nor=
throp Frye and W.=20

Later issues included political reporting by Amy Wilentz and=20
Christopher Hitchens and the kind of=20
offbeat matchup of writer and subject that Mr. Sonnenberg loved to instigat=
e.=20
For example=2C he commissioned the jazz critic Gary Giddins to profile Jack=
 Benny. The Washington Post=2C=20
surveying the winter 1985 issue=2C described the magazine as =93Hellenic=2C=

=93Of all those characteristics=2C the one I find hardest to accept is=20
=91impeccable=2C=92 =94 Mr. Sonnenberg told The Boston Globe in 1990.=20


Benjamin Sonnenberg Jr. was born in Manhattan on Dec. 30=2C 1936. His=20

It was not a happy childhood. Ben made himself unwelcome at a series=20

Oscar Wilde as his role model and=20
doted on the writings of the Marquis de Sade.=20

Happy Junetime, those with the Summertime Blues and those in Australia!
We at www.UnlikelyStories.org would like to announce:

Lawrence Welsh, Kim Noriega and Rex Wilder will read
on Thursday, July 8 at 8pm
at Loyola Marymount University
in Los Angeles, California
ECC 1857, University Hall

Lawrence Welsh is the author of Unlikely's latest chapbook, /Carney
Takedown/, and he'll have copies of that, and many of his other books,
on hand in L.A. Check out /Carney Takedown/ at
http://www.unlikelystories.org/10/welsh0410.shtml , and learn more about
his collection of works at http://www.lawrencewelsh.com/

then behold:

An Unlikely Literary Happening
On Friday, July 30 at 8pm
at FORUM Arts + Culture
in El Paso, Texas
1500 Texas Ave. at Cotton St.

We'll be showing the poetry films of León De la Rosa, author of the
forthcoming Unlikely Book /Soy solo palabras but wish to be a city/.
We'll have a discussion with psychotherapist Deb Hoag, author of the
forthcoming Unlikely Book /Dr. Gonzo/. And we'll climax with a live
reading featuring Lawrence Welsh, Donna Snyder, Ray Ramos and Jen
Shugert, who'll be reading before an actively-mixed video feed from
videojockeys Rene Lopez and Tipo. Oh, and we should have a DJ. I should
call one. That would be smart.

FORUM Arts + Culture is a literary-friendly, non-profit, artist-run
gallery with a beautiful, multi-roomed space above a warehouse. The
space offers the perfect venue for displaying León's many films in
freakish conjunction, and boasts a main stage backed by a northern view
of the mountains. We'll be brutally covering that view with acetone for
our videojockeys, and let me tell you, if you've never seen a poetry
read accompanied by video feed, it's a real different experience, one
that you'll take with you in a haze of entrancement, enchantment, and
xanax. Also: we'll have wine. $5 suggested donation at the door.

Astute readers will notice the lack of updates at
www.UnlikelyStories.org recently -- please rest assured we are,
nonetheless, working our asses off. The July 30 event is in preparation
for our huge book release at this year's Burning Man Arts Festival in
Nevada. We will be releasing five full-length books in three volumes:

Monolith, poetry by Anne McMillen, bound together with Soy solo palabras
but wish to be a city, a graphic longpoem (like a comic book, yo) by
León De la Rosa and illustrated by gui.ra.ga7
My Hands Were Clean, nonfiction ranting by Tom Bradley, bound together
with Dr. Gonzo, an analysis of the mental health industry by Deb Hoag
and /Unlikely Stories of the Third Kind. Unlikely Stories of the Third
Kind/ is the physical representation of all things Unlikely, including
110 pages of fiction, 100 pages of essays and reviews, 90 pages of
poetry, 40 pages of color visual art, 40 pages of B&W visual art, a CD
of music and spoken word and a DVD of assorted literary-themed films.
We're making final selections for it now (so if you've been waiting to
hear back from us, and would like to confirm that we received your
submission, now is the time). Nonetheless, there will be a mini-text
issue later this week, featuring the release of the winner of the 2009
WRITE REAL GOOD Poetry Chapbook Contest, /When You Come Again, You Will
Never Go/ by Andreas Morgner. There will be a multimedia issue in
mid-July, and a full-sized text and multimedia issue in the first half
of August. Then it's Burning Man, baby. Maybe we'll see you there.

I'm looking for a few poets who can translate Spanish into English.
If you are interested in a new project, just e-mail me for details.
