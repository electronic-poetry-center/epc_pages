Subject: BOOBY, BE QUIET! -- "One of the most engaged and enthusiastic
works of poetics in recent years" (Charles Bernstein)

Dear friends.=20

Booby, Be Quiet! is a collection of essays and columns about poetry,
literature and literary politics(the title is a very learn=C3=A9d reference to
Auden=E2=80=99s translation of the Eddas). The essays and columns have been
published in various places in the last five years =E2=80=93 about
half of the bo=
ok
consists of material written for The Reykjav=C3=ADk Grapevine, Iceland's englis=
h
speaking magazine, the other half are lectures and longer pieces written fo=
r
various occasions, but all aimed at a foreign audience.

The book is currently available on the poEsia web:
http://www.poesia.fi/booby-be-quiet/

It can also be downloaded as a pdf =E2=80=93 no strings, but free donation
apreciated (5-15 euro suggested =E2=80=93 click here:

BOOBY BE QUIET Eir=C3=ADkur =C3=96rn Nor=C3=B0dahl
=20
=E2=80=9CThese youthfully exuberant essays on translation, innovation,
performanc=
e,
and audience are compelling, delightful, and often funny: illuminating as
Reykjavik white nights and sharp as the skate blade of a North American
racing champion. Eir=C3=ADkur =C3=96rn Nor=C3=B0dahl redefines the
issue of poetry and
national language in a brilliant and transformative essay that is the
centerpiece of the collection. His impatience with the tried and true is
infectious. One of the most engaged and enthusiastic works of poetics in
recent years. =E2=80=9C

Charles Bernstein, author of All the Whiskey in Heaven (Farrar, Strauss &
Giroux, 2010), Attack of the Difficult Poems  (University of Chicago Press,
2011) amongst other books.


=E2=80=9CNor=C3=B0dahl's essays are brilliant vivisections of
contemporary poetry and=
 its
problems, filtered through the prism of Iceland's 2008 economic collapse =E2=80=
=94 a
close cousin of our own so-called "economic downturn."   The kitschy,
nostalgia-driven "future economies" of both contemporary money culture and
poetry culture are closely linked here (and elsewhere):  " . . . the presen=
t
worships an outdated past, even at the cost of a living present."  As poets
we may be working toward a goal of "fame" in the twilight of imagination =E2=80=
=94
and, as citizens, working toward "affluence" in the twilight of capitalism =
=E2=80=94
but if we identify the importance of the living moment as "the only eternit=
y
that lasts, without pause," at least one of us may yet become that "he or
she who affects . . . the entire critical mass of moments we call eternity"
=E2=80=94  beyond the mirage-like glow of "fame."   Nor=C3=B0dahl's
lively essays als=
o
introduce us to (perhaps) heretofore unexplored global poetries old and new
in the most entertaining way, and leave us pondering a few delightful
scenarios: "Imagine a poem so robust and resourceful that it could survive
humanity . . . the nuclear dust finally settles and all that's left of
mankind is poetry."  Considering how long poetry's been around, that's
probably what's going to happen anyway.  But in case you're wondering what =
a
poetry that robust might look like, there may be some presentiments of it
right here.=E2=80=9D=20

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CArticulating Space: Short Es=
says on Poetry=E2=80=9D by Jessica Smith
Description:=20
Composed between 2000 and 2006, these short essays on poetry and poetics st=
raddle the genres of traditional academic essay and manifesto. They include=
 analyses of L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poetics (Andrews, Bernstein, DuP=
lessis, Hejinian, Howe, McCaffery, and Silliman) and poetry by Modernists E=
liot, Stein, and Zukofsky; 19th Century poets Browning, Rossetti and Shelle=
y; and contemporary poets Cecilia Vicu=C3=B1a and Christian B=C3=B6k. Spinn=
ing 200 years of poetry and philosophy, Smith weaves a theory of the concom=
itance of space and time in language.

~

Right now is what dwindling feels like, despite
the mulberry outside my window steadfastly
anchoring its taproot. The new century counts planets
that might support rooted beings and ravenous predators.
But stardust piles up on lines connecting dots
in constellations, blurring them into nebulae. Shapeless
experience waffles between concrete and abstract, accounting
for the popularity of horoscopes, especially when Jupiter enters
Aries and we vacillate, like volcanoes heaving ash
before the pyroclastic flow, collapsing before tsunami, dwindling
until the next cycle. I abstractly shake dew from ripe mulberries.
Or I lie down, gazing at shivering green tracery non-existent
a couple of months ago and just as soon to vanish.
A more or less concrete cup of coffee balances on my belly,
wobbling to the diastolic and systolic rhythms of my heart.

SOME NEW VISUAL POETICS:

With the statue of William Penn standing guard, the protestors of Occupy
Philadelphia are standing up. But there's also another rather large
monument, just across the street in Thomas Paine Plaza, that is keeping a=

watchful eye as well.

It's Jacques Lipchitz's "Government of the People," which was designed as=
 a
symbol for democracy and dedicated during the bicentennial of the United
States of America in 1976.

In light of everything that's now occurring, I think Government of the
People is starting to make more sense to more people.

This Sunday, Nov. 13, 2:00-5:30 pm, at the Memorial Art Gallery auditorium,=
 500 University Ave., Rochester, there will be a group reading to celebrate=
 the forthcoming Poets Walk, Rochester and honor poets to be included in th=
is tribute to two centuries of poetry in the Greater Rochester/WNY area (in=
cluding Lucille Clifton and Robert Creeley). Over 40 poets will read their =
chosen poem, and others will read poems by departed poets or poets not able=
 to be present.

The reading will be followed by a reception in the atrium of the Gallery.

Poets Walk, a sidewalk along University Avenue between North Goodman Street=
 and Prince Street, will feature the engraved words of local poets placed i=
n granite blocks and bands throughout the length of the block. An interacti=
ve component will allow visitors to use their cell phones to hear audio rec=
ordings of community voices performing poetry written by local poets or poe=
ts who are historically significant.

Transcripts and audio of the included poems, along with biographical inform=
ation from each featured poet, can be found at http://artdrop.democratandch=
ronicle.com/poets-walk .

 Poets Walk, a joint venture between the City of Rochester, the Memorial Ar=
t Gallery and Writers & Books, is part of the Artwalk Extension project.

**Bone Bouquet
http://www.bonebouquet.org

For two years, Bone Bouquet has aimed to highlight the important work =20=

of female poets, who are often underrepresented in the writing =20
community and popular media. Rather than personal politics, their =20
criteria are excellence and vibrance. Rather than segregating the =20
poetry of =93women=92s issues=94 from =93regular=94 creative work, their =
goal is =20
to provide an additional arena in which female poets can make their =20
work more visible to readers, building their reputations as artists.

*Sarah Bridgins

Sarah Bridgins=92 work has appeared in Monkeybicycle, InDigest, Pear =20
Noir!, Playground, and Bone Bouquet among other journals. She lives in =20=

Brooklyn with a cat and a boy.

Lauren Nicole Nixon is a Brooklyn-based artist representative, =20

After Language / Letters to Jack Spicer
         Stephen Vincent     (BlazeVox)

 The test of a true poem, Stephen Vincent writes, is how not to die for it.
How can a book that chills you to the bone =97 As Jack Spicer=92s Language
surely does =97 become a structuring, challenging, politicizing and even
comforting recurring presence through forty years of a life lived under its
spell? With a hard-won, contrarian patience, Vincent applies the test, and
the hope he finds at the end is all the more convincing for the
precariousness of the path it takes through the silent gap between *No* and
*One listens to poetry*.

=97Peter Manson


Stephen Vincent's engagement with Jack Spicer's poetry goes arguably
farther back than anyone who wasn't a friend or acquaintance. What is not
arguable is the generative richness of that engagement. Having been sent
Spicer's Language by a friend while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in a
Nigeria poised on the brink of civil war, he finds in its "uncomfortable
music" a poetry uncannily expanding the borders of meaning. Cast in the
creative-epistolary form of Spicer's own After Lorca, this book is a
tactful searching: it respects the intransigence of the poems, and tries,
in the gentlest of ways, to understand the man who wrote them. After
Language is a meditation on interpretive migration, on the troubled paths
of poetic inheritance, and on the tangled, fraught (and yes, magical) ways
that poetry survives it makers.

*David Brazil, ECONOMY*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/david-bra=
zil-economy>
In David Brazil=92s *ECONOMY* a meditation takes shape as prosody, and the
material trace of that effort is everywhere in evidence. Such a scrap heap
of thought in facsimile might at first be reminiscent of Francis Ponge=92s
notational practice in *The Making of the Pr=E9*. However, in Brazil=92s
pr=E9/conomics the field=92s littered with home furnishings: =93From stuff,=
 to
sense, among us.=94 And the elemental dwelling places of sentiment are
politicized: home (=93The house as a production unit, productive=94) and al=
so
touch (as both sentimental & productive). *ECONOMY* is a home economics *as
prosody*: =93Am I doing the right things with my time?=94

*Pattie McCarthy,
L&O*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/pattie-mccarthy-lo>
In this, the fourth book from Pattie McCarthy, repetition marks the
coordinates of maternity and childhood. Divided into two sections, the
first =93Liminal=94 opens between the death of a father and the speaker=92s
pregnancy. =93=85it=92s easy to disappear/ completely into it. *masses of f=
lowers*=94
McCarthy writes while rendering a figure neither wholly swallowed by grief
or birth, but extensively visible in such a threshold state punctuated by
=93the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf=94 (in quotation from WCW), the son wh=
o
eats =93=85a freshly/ fallen orange/ autumn leaf before/ anyone can stop hi=
m.=94
The second section =93Oyer=94, Middle English for hearing (also in the lega=
l
sense before a court) cribs it=92s 14 line structure from the sonnet, yet
end-rhymes give way to a more imperfect repetition that nonetheless defines
an intimacy across =93this precipitous division=94  =97 =93the baby raises =
his arms
(because he/ believes me & I pick him up=97=85=94 Such returning gestures (=
and
returning phases) define the consolation of what repeats as well as the
harder mourning for what can=92t. These determinatives =93make explicit the
caesura,=94 McCarthy writes while weaving each section from a bordering
network of quotation, multiplying the body of the text further, so that
from =93=85quietly inside the house, it expands to meet you.=94

"Tony Trigilio's Historic Diary (named after Lee Harvey Oswald's account
of his time in the Soviet Union) excavates the nightmarish record of the
first Kennedy assassination, its auguries and aftermath, with a blue
fury and an obsessive zeal that border on the Talmudic.  What he finds
there goes beyond chilling to a pure-product-of-America craziness that
makes me tremble for my country.  'I am waiting // for someone to / ride
me, the / locomotive of history,' Trigilio writes, and his ticket beyond
the grave takes us, willy-nilly, on this scarifying, brilliant, and
disturbing ride" (Rachel Loden)

"'Hegel makes no sense when everyone is looking at you,'" confides the
protagonist of Tony Trigilio's Historic Diary, and he's speaking from
experience.  In this extraordinary work of imaginative reconstruction,
Trigilio assembles a postmodernist Warren Commission Report from
archival research, obituaries, interviews, and historical broadcasts
surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, only to discover, in
the chaos of evidence, rumor, and falsehood, that no dialectical method
can offer his speaker an escape from the prison house of paranoia.  By
composing what Ezra Pound would have called 'a poem including history'
from this harrowing litany of Cold War casualties, however, he offers
his reader the stark consolation of an elegy for the truth itself: 'This
is the story of what never happened, written ahead of time'" (Srikanth
Reddy)

"Richly varied and deeply brave, Historic Diary is both a page-turner
that takes you into remote corners of the Kennedy assassination
controversy, and a bold postmodernist collage of poetic styles, voices,
and forms. This fine book will keep you rereading and reworking the
fragments the poet offers until you are left with not only an oblique
but fascinating portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald and the times in which he
lived, but also a challenging poetic exploration of the nature of
history itself" (Martha Collins)

If you're at a loose end, or even if you're as busy as hell, please take a
minute or two to read TRUCK at http://halvard-johnson.blogspot.com/  I've
published a sequence to follow Doug and Sheila's - and this one is by Phil
Hall, Canadian poet, and myself, Aussie bloke. I explain the circumstances
before the poem, but I must tell you my wife suggested placing it in the
mag at this stage. Good thought. I normally avoid publishing myself when
I'm editing - it just seems bad manners - but I tell myself it is a
sequence, and Phil had more control over it than I had. I hope you agree.

You'll also find Lawrence there, and Ken Wolman, and Australian poets Geof
Page and Andrew Taylor.

More to come in the days that follow!

Brmmm brmmm and off we go again ...

What if Kafka had written the =E2=80=9CKama Sutra=E2=80=9D? What if the rhe=

 What if the icons of punk and glam found themselves curled up with Sheena =
of the Jungle? What happens when a poet draws a lucky card in the Mexican l=
otteria? What if poems were made from the flotsam and jetsam of culture, hi=
gh and low? What if the author really has died, as Roland Barthes told us h=
e would, and been replaced by the scriptor, whose sole power is to mingle t=
exts? What if Jimi Hendryx had only given us the last two words of =E2=80=
=98Voodoo Child (slight return)=E2=80=99? The questions, if not all the ans=

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CEndless, Beautiful, Exact=E2=
=80=9D by Francesco Levato
Description:=20
A series of texts, remixed from appropriated oral and written source materi=
al, which explore interpersonal conflict through a fragmented and implied n=
arrative. The author seems to have a clampdown on what he is willing to exp=
ress, and what few words are allowed through are charged with emotion and t=
ension.

The Poetry Bus, Irelands newest and second best independent magazine (Carty=
s Poetry Journal being THE best, check it out!!!) is fundraising for the th=
ird issue. Its edited, its set, its ready to run, only its held hostage by =
the printers who are refusing to release it until the print run is paid for=
. The cheek of them, and it a recession and all!!!

So the Poetry Bus Liberation Front is asking poetry lovers everywhere to he=
lp out with FUNDIT.ie and subscribe, where you can get a copy of issue 3, w=
ith a FreeCD and other enhanced packages!!!

Background

The Poetry Bus started off as a blog which started off as a thread on the w=
ebsite of the Stinging Fly (Irelands third best independent magazine after =
the Bus and Cartys Poetry Journal!!!). Two issues have hit the streets, and=
 the next is in the garage as we speak.

If you cant donate to get a copy, give it some publicity anyway, share onli=
ne... we have =E2=82=AC600 to raise in 5 days!!!!

Yabba dabba do it now, to paraphrase Peadar O Donoghue, the Poetry Bus chie=
f engineer!!!!

    Barzakh, a biannual multi-genre journal with an internationalist
stance run by graduate students in the English department at the
University at Albany, SUNY is open to submissions for its next issue.
?Barzakh?  is a word / concept that names the connecting link, the
?between? of something, such as different spheres of existence. In
light of the current global occupy movements Barzakh is seeking
innovative creative, critical and collaborative writing as well as
writing in translation that specifically addresses the political
implications of "the idea of being as essentially
being-with-one-another." The "between" of self
and other is what allows other and self to reverse positions and thus
complicates fixed notions of identity and relationship.  When we are
with one another and aware of the between we are vulnerable because
our position can be changed.  How can language specifically address
and facilitate this vulnerable "between"?  Can the polis be an
all-inclusive space and what role would language play in it?  Can
power relations be conceived as  flowing between concentric circles
rather than as a hierarchical top down movements? Can both
listening/reading and speaking be considered
authorial and thus reciprocal? Can there be a politics of reciprocal
relationship or love based on mutual respect?  Can the other be
animal, plant, machine, alien or self?  How could an all-inclusive
polis be one that is based on differentiation and not assimilation?
How could a unity of diversity be articulated in language? For its
next issue Barzakh is looking for innovative creative, critical and
collaborative writing as well as writing in translation that addresses
the ethos and praxis of sharing in common a polis that is contingent
on the "between" of "being with."

Please send any creative or critical work that delves into these
subjects to barzakh@gmail.com by February 28, 2012.

What are the new poetics and the new manifestos? What do authors REALLY DO
when they write, and what can we learn from their investigations? This
series of talks on queer poetics, titled in honor of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,
explores the intersection of queer writing, the manifesto, poetic practice,
and pedagogy.

MASS NON-VIOLENT DIRECT ACTION !

THE REVOLUTION CONTINUES !

The Occupy Wall Street! Movement is calling upon you to participate in
an international day of direct action on November 17th and again on
November 19th in celebration of the the two month anniversary of the
Occupy Wall Street! Movement.

http://occupywallst.org/action/november-17th/

"Occupy Together" ...

http://www.occupytogether.org/

"The last week has seen a coordinated attack against numerous major
occupations in the United States, including Portland, Phoenix, Salt
Lake City, Seattle, Denver, Oakland, San Francisco, New York and other
cities across the country.  Several news reports have indicated that
these simultaneous attacks were directed by the Department of Homeland
Security, in consultation with local mayors and police departments.
It should be clear to us that this is happening not because we are
weak, but because we have become a real threat to the status quo, and
the US government fears the new, more forceful direction the Occupy
Wall Street! movement has taken in recent weeks.  If our adversaries
in the government can coordinate a national offensive against the
'Occupy' movement, then we too can coordinate a response that draws
upon the considerable depth, breadth and diversity of our occupations.
 Occupy Wall Street=92s national call for a two month birthday
celebration on November 17th is an important step in this direction.
To continue this national momentum, we call on all other occupations
to join our day of action against state repression on November 19th."

Friends of the Fox:

The second issue of the Parks & Occupation special series is out, and can
be downloaded for free at http://whiskeyandfox.org

At least one more Parks & Occ. is on the way.

No. 2 features work by Joshua Zelesnick, Rebecca Mertz, Gloria Frym,
Michael Farrell, Andy Spragg, Gracie Leavitt & RJ Maitland, Robin Clarke,
Jeff T. Johnson, David Hadbawnik, and Jon D. Witmer. Again, another set of
fantastic work. As (this time) Duncan writes, "No crow flies. It is not
America./ From what we call Poetry/ a bird I cannot name crows."

WHY I AM A NET ARTIST
http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0014.214

A new essay I wrote published in the Journal of Electronic Publishing in an
issue on digital poetry. The essay is called Why I am a Net Artist in which
I attempt to explain my folly and explore some of the properties of the
medium.

If you google +"Why I am a Net Artist" you will find but one instance of
this phrase on the net. Or, if there are, by now, multiple instances, they
will all refer to this essay.

Litteraria Pragensia Books is proud to announce the publication of

*PIERRE JORIS - CARTOGRAPHIES OF THE IN-BETWEEN*
ed. Peter Cockelbergh
ISBN 978-80-7308-370-0 (paperback). 420pp.
http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/joris.html

 Pierre Joris's work is known to many and in many guises, but nevertheless
seems to slip through the mazes of American, British, French, North
African, Luxemburgish and German secondary literature. Long overdue, this
volume brings together renowned poets, critics, philosophers, translators
and scholars, all with different backgrounds and languages, contributing a
range of texts on as many aspects of Joris's work as possible (and needed).
The main sections of the book are devoted to spaces (Luxemburgish, North
African and English), "po, po & po" (poetry, poetics & politics), nomadics,
translations, and American "lineages and crossovers." Additionally, short
so-called "geographemes" cut across the book, in which Joris revisits and
ruminates on earlier campsites, journeys and writings. Supplementing this
volume, an online archival platform with additional poems, audio and video
materials, unpublished essays, translations and book illustrations will be
launched as well.

About the editor:
Writer, scholar and translator, *Peter Cockelbergh* studied at the
universities of Antwerp and Leuven (Belgium), at the EHESS in Paris, and is
currently working on a PhD at the Technische Universitat Darmstadt
(Germany). For a number of years, he has been reading, writing on and
translating Pierre Joris's poetry and essays (into Dutch, French &
English), and has recently worked on the author's papers and archives.

Subject:      Call for Papers: kadar koli=?windows-1252?Q?=97the_?= Violence
              issue
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-2
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

*Call for Papers: kadar koli--the Violence issue*



The idea for this special issue of* kadar koli *emerged from a question
posted by British poet Keston Sutherland to the UK poetry listserv and to
the *Sous Les Pav=E9s* online discussion group in response to "calls for
violence" during and after the U.K. protests: "I ... want to know what peop=
le
think about the wishing for and urging of violence (against whom? just the
police, or who else? how?)." One example cited by Sutherland is Justin
Katko's "Lines for a Protest Song, After 9 December":



Sometimes I wish that instead of their horses

They'd call up the hold where they store their guns;

And when they shoot one of us down we'll rise up stronger,

For in the taste of our blood be remembered we are one.



Sutherland's question is an urgent one, particularly for participants in
the "Occupy" movement who are debating the role of violence in collective
action, its justifications and consequences: What *kind* of violence?
Coming *from* whom? For *what* ends? Indeed, from Tunisia to London to
Oakland, our current geo-political landscape has been swept by a series of
uprisings, reminding us of the power of mass mobilization and of the
intimate connection between violence and democracy. What role does or can
poetry play in these uprisings? This question suggests the venerable
problem of aesthetics and politics: How might thinking about violence
alongside poetic practice throw different light on this quandary?



These questions open up other areas of possible inquiry that fall under the
general heading of violence and contemporary poetry. How have contemporary
poets responded to or documented different kinds and instances of violence?
What kinds of poetic practices have been developed as a result of violence?
How does violence get defined or named by poetry? Slavoj =AEi=BEek says we
should distance ourselves from "the fascinating lure" of "violence
performed by a particular agent" and instead try "to perceive the
background which generates such outbursts." How does or can poetry disclose
the unseen contours of the violence that determines our everyday lives? How
can poetry illuminate--or sound out--the histories of discipline and
punishment that determine the quotidian?



Violence is often said to be "meaningless." But perhaps violence does have
meaning. What can it tell us? How does it communicate? Perhaps, it is only
the poem that can help us answer these questions. How have poets reckoned
with the ways that language itself is bound up with violence? Similarly,
how might the poetic act be an act of violence, however necessarily?



Finally, it might be said that the same logics that structure our
socio-cultural realities also shape the field of contemporary poetry.
Certain "brands" of poetry, for example, remain dominant. The editors would
like to see work that tackles the structural violence that shapes our
field.



For this special issue of *kadar koli*, we invite submissions that reckon
with the relation between violence and contemporary poetry. We seek *poetry=
*,
short critical *statements* (max. 1,500 words), and longer critical
*essays*(max. 4,000 words). We are also interested in
*art* (collage, photographs, drawings). *Deadline for submission is January
15.*



*kadar koli* 7 will be produced as a print journal, as well as an
open-source, downloadable file, in Spring 2012.

WHY I AM A NET ARTIST
http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0014.214

A new essay I wrote published in the Journal of Electronic Publishing in an
issue on digital poetry. The essay is called Why I am a Net Artist in which
I attempt to explain my folly and explore some of the properties of the
medium.

If you google +=22Why I am a Net Artist=22 you will find but one instance of
this phrase on the net. Or, if there are, by now, multiple instances, they
will all refer to this essay.

The professional Jew-hater G. K. Chesterton was a hugely fat man who
dressed to accentuate his fatness and devised a jolly prose style to
accompany that persona. Reading the typography of a Chesterton fanzine
here, I discover something about how jolliness is communicated.

bill bissett's work is very readable, actually. and he makes his living
selling his books, cds, and paintings at readings. people buy his books and
read them. many years ago, jack kerouac described him as the greatest living
poet.

bill bissett gets the sort of resistance in canada that allen ginsberg got
in the usa. and bissett is still at it after all these years. keeping an
open mind.

Hi. It's Jennifer,

I have begun to compile an EPC page for the poet Mary Rising Higgins. I am
looking for assistance with the project. Our plan is make PDFs of all her
books. I need help with a few things: 1. I need most of the books and/or I
need help scanning the books. Would anyone like to take a few hours to scan
their copies of Mary's books? Would anyone be able to loan/sell me the
books? The ones I need are below. 2. I need permission from all of Mary's
publishers - so if you published Mary - please write me. 3. Anyone with any
other documents of interest, please email me. I have a cd of Mary reading
with Gene and a few other folks at the Harwood Center in Abq -Mary also
used to handmade little Christmas chapbooks, so if any one has those? Below
is the list of books -

Anyone who will help (or has a student who will help) will be grandly
karmically rewarded.

Mary was/is a very special poet & we don't want folks to forget her.

Network Archaeology
Conference at Miami University, Oxford OH
April 19-21, 2012
Call for Papers (submissions due November 29, 2011)

This conference will bring together scholars and practitioners to =
explore the resonances between digital networks and =93older=94 (perhaps =
still emergent) systems of circulation; from roads to cables, from =
letter-writing networks to digital ink. Drawing on recent research in =
media archaeology, we see network archaeology as a method for =
re-orienting the temporality and spatiality of network studies. Network =
archaeology might pay attention to the history of distribution =
technologies, location and control of geographical resources, the =
emergence of circulatory models, proximity and morphology, network =
politics and power, and the transmission properties of media. What can =
we learn about contemporary cultural production and circulation from the =
examination of network histories? How can we conceptualize the =
polychronic developments of networks, including their growth, =
adaptation, and resistances? How might the concept of network =
archaeology help to re-envision and forge new paths of interdisciplinary =
research, collaboration, and scholarship?

The conference will trace continuities and disjunctures between a =
variety of networks, including telecommunication networks, distribution =
systems for both digital and non-digital texts, transportation routes, =
media storage (libraries, databases, e-archiving), electrical grids, =
radio and television broadcast networks, the internet, and surveillance =
networks. We seek to address not only the technological, institutional, =
and geopolitical histories of networks, but also their cultural and =
experiential dimensions, extending to encompass the histories of network =
poetics and practice. The proceeds of the conference will form the basis =
for a substantial publication on Network Archaeology.

This conference is organized by the Miami University Humanities Center =
and is the final event in a year-long series entitled =93Networked =
Environments: Interrogating the Democratization of Media.=94 It is a =
companion to our Fall 2011 symposium, =93Networks and Power,=94 on =
November 17-18th featuring panels, interventions, and keynote =
presentations by Wendy Chun (Brown University) and Lisa Parks (UC Santa =
Barbara), that interrogate the interrelationships between networked =
environments, both old and new, and varied forms of power. The =
=93Networked Environments=94 series, involving an interdisciplinary =
group of ten humanities scholars, seeks to show how the network dynamics =
so crucial to contemporary political developments have deep and perhaps =
unexpected roots in the histories of earlier forms of information =
production and circulation.

We welcome presentations of academic research and artistic projects on =
contemporary and historical network studies. Please send abstracts of =
250 words and a short bio to cris cheek (cheekc@muohio.edu) and Nicole =
Starosielski (nicole.starosielski@muohio.edu) by November 29, 2011.

Lisa Gitelman, Associate Professor of Media and English at New York =
University, and author of Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines: =

I wonder if you know, or recall, the name of that French
post-structuralist philosopher whose thesis, I believe, was that
'fiction' begins on the letter-face? Typography being the land of the
poem... I dearly wish to remember.

I was just about to send the final copy of my new manuscript of poems to =
my publisher (U. of Pitt) when I started looking up issues of fair use =
with regard to song lyrics. I want to quote 1 line from a Bob Dylan song =
as an epigraph. Does anyone know if I need permission? Am I in danger of =
being sued? Obviously the press won't pay any money for that kind of =
thing. Of course I'm down to the wire and need to know what to do asap.=20=

Thanks for any input.

I don't know, sorry. But it sounds like a fruitful idea.

Occupy di Suvero

From a class, http://nyc.thepublicschool.org/class/3805 , Conversations after
Performance, offered by Taeyoon Choi; they were occupying the Mark di Suvero
sculpture a few doors down from Eyebeam and we joined them for a while.
Taeyoon's work is amazing, by the way - check it out.

"Next door, Paula Cooper gallery is showing Mark Di Suvero pieces called
'Paula's pleasure' It's a huge swing made of rusted H-beams. He is the
artist who made 'the big red thing' in Zuccotti Park. It may be
interesting to 'Occupy' the sculpture for our conversation, temporary and
poetically it may be.

Hi,=20
I was wondering if anyone knows of a 'complete' collected poems by
William Bronk?
I know that North Point published Life Supports in 1982. I'm not sure if
the Talisman reissue
of it in 1997 added any additional material. I can't get a table of
contents from Amazon to check.
I know that Bronk lived until 1999 and published many volumes after Life
Supports was released.

Thanks,
Ric
