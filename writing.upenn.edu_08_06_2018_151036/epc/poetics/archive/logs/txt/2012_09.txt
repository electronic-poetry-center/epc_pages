from "The Amateur Scientistâ€™s Notebook: Floret as Bird"

What is hunger if I once listened to a floret
slurp spilt water into soil, its sex a spore on wind,
a single seed left for a bird to eat. With any certainty
I could not call you bird. I could not call you
anything other thanâ€”Like, say, in the shallows
of the river we laid crawdad traps until our fingers pruned.
 From the bankâ€™s oxblood-colored body we uprooted
clay, molded wet grains into plates, set them on some
stones to harden. Shoes soaked in silt, we swelled,
a hunger heavy as a field of florets, feathers
dreamed to sprout from skin. A hunger of when one
is lost once in another. Anything other thanâ€”
(Whether we notice the moth at the lamp,
or its shadow winged on the wall).
We were privy to all manner of underhanded shit.
We were a kind of happiness, meaning
â€œmomentarily without guiltâ€
or, â€œnot poised to attack.â€
Or astonishment:  the work
of becoming another.
The stalled animal of the body at rest.
Hair collecting in the comb.
A single wire, unbending.

**Greying Ghost Press
http://www.greyingghost.com
Greying Ghost started in March of 2007. Since the very beginning they =20=

have had the pleasure of working with many exceptional authors whose =20
commitment to expanding the power of the written word has energized =20
their commitment to print their work. All of its books are handmade =20
and, in most cases, every aspect of production is done in-house. This =20=

includes the processes of printing, binding, and shipping. Each cover =20=

is hand stamped or pressed. And all of its mail orders are stuffed =20
full with either old photos, fragments of old maps and books, comic =20
scraps, or, most importantly, FREE* pamphlets of poems by people they =20=

admire.

**Eric Amling
http://wewhoareabouttodie.com/2010/07/20/eric-amling-on-eric-amling/

Black Ocean next year. He teaches writing at Baruch College and lives =20=

in Jackson Heights, Queens.

in Australia.

The music Hack writes is always based on meaningful world issues, =20
events, and experiences. Her song, "Saya Tidak Bersalah" (I'm not =20
Guilty), is a song about an Australian woman wrongfully imprisoned in =20=

Indonesia. Her song fueled an international human rights campaign and =20=

Please join us this Friday 8/31 performance at White Box (329 Broome
west of Bowery) at 7 PM:

*AXIAL MUSIC*

*David Arner* (keyboard, balophone)
*John Beaulieu* (keyboard, harmonica)
*George Quasha* (percussion)
*Charles Stein* (voice, recorder)

Axial Music follows a principle of spontaneous composition without the
intention of honoring precedent or previous patterns, guided instead by
radical following of actual sounds generated. When successful the sound
event has a life independent of the musicians and may generate an
altered state of listening. In addition to sound events, the performance
has visual components, including axial drawing & video.

 For friends in town for the holiday weekend, I'll be reading at Jujomukti
Tea Lounge (East Village) on Sunday night. Hope to see you there. Best,
Deborah

*

Finish off the summer in style. Join us at the Jujomukti Tea Lounge as we
host poets Deborah Poe and Joe Roarty, Sun Sep 2 6-8 p.m.

Hosted by George Wallace. Open Mic. $5.00 admission may be applied to the
purchase of a tea or coffee of equal or lesser value.

Deborah Poe is the author of the poetry collections Elements (2010), Our
Parenthetical Ontology (2008), and the last will be stone, too (2013) as
well as a novella in verse, H=E9l=E8ne (2012). In addition, Deborah is
co-editor of both Between Worlds
: An Anthology of Contemporary Fiction and Criticism (2012) and a
collection of Hudson Valley innovative poetry (2013). She teaches
literature and creative writing at Pace University, Westchester.

Joe Roarty has wandered about the midwest and east coast for lo these many
years. A rolling stone gathers no moss, but intermittent bouts of poetry
have enlivened an otherwise quotidian existence. (That and having his arm
torn off by Beowulf.)

For those of you in the Atlanta area, please come down to the Goat Farm
for a celebration of Cage's music and writings. Below is the blurb. The
Atlanta Poets Group will be performing various Cage pieces (including
"Anarchy," "45' For a Speaker,"  "Diary: how to improve the world (you
will only make matters worse) Continued 1967" and selections from _I-VI_
and "Empty Words." See the Goat Farm FB page for more info
(https://www.facebook.com/events/350313001717893/).
Best,
James Sanders

_In honor of the 100th birthday of John Cage_

This experience is created by:
The Atlanta Poets Group
Chamber Cartel
Bent Frequency
The CORE Performance Company

________________________________________________
Performances:

Sept 6 | The Ten Thousand Things | 8 pm

Sept 7 | Four4 | 8 pm

Sept 9 | MUSICIRCUS | 3 pm
________________________________________________

The Ten Thousand Things is a four-day celebration (September 6-9) of the
work of John Cage (1912-1992)-- a luminary in 20th century avant-garde
music, poetry, and visual art--on the occasion of the 100th anniversary
of his birth.

Presented by the Goat Farm and curated by The Atlanta Poets Group, Bent
Frequency, and Chamber Cartel, the events promise listening experiences
rare in the worlds of music or literature.

Among these are a performance of four simultaneous virtuosic solos, an
evening length percussion work, a soprano and percussion duo, and a
multivoice realization of a mesostic.

The culminating event of The Ten Thousand Things is a "Musicircus," a
collage-style musical happening of simultaneous, multiple performances:
audience members are invited to stroll around the performance venue and
partake in pieces that are of interest to them at that particular
moment. Please join us to celebrate John Cage's 100th birthday and revel
in sound and silence!

This election season, /Unlikely Stories: Episode IV/ will assemble and
publish an Interdependency Issue, in which we, as American members of
the small press, will celebrate the U.S. as part of a planet and a globe
which might not be a "global community" but really should be. We are
looking for:
Poetry
Fiction
Creative Non-Fiction
Art & Literary Criticism
Cultural & Sociopolitical Analyses
Static Visual Art
Time-Based Art and other forms of Movies and Videos
Music
Spoken Word
Sound Art
...and just about any other form of thought that can be reproduced on
the Web.

We want it in:
English or Espanglish.

We want it from:
Anyone, any where in the world, who is NOT a United States citizen, OR
Anyone who is a citizen of one of the tribal governments within the U.S., OR
U.S. citizens CURRENTLY living outside of the U.S., specifically writing
(or creating art) about their experiences outside of the U.S.

We want it to be about:
Any subject EXCEPT U.S. elections, past or present. Although /Unlikely
Stories: Episode IV/ often has a sociopolitical slant, we publish a
variety of works on every topic, and your work need not be
sociopolitical in theme. Check us out at http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/
and read the sort of stuff we normally publish, or check out our regular
submission guidelines at http://www.unlikelystories.org/submit.shtml for
specific directives. WE DO NOT WANT WORK ON THE U.S. ELECTIONS. Really,
you can find someplace else to send that at this time.

We want it by October 1st, 2012. We will publish two weeks before the
U.S. presidential election.

Thanks for your consideration,
--

Hello!

After two months of delays, and most of an extra day, the new issue is
now up at http://www.lightningdpress.com! Issue Five includes our
first Short Piece, poems from Thomas Meyer, Jamie Felton, Steven
Manuel, Jeff Miller, R.N. Horner, Sarah Rosenthal, Patrick James
Dunagan, Calvin Pennix, and correspondence from Thomas Meyer. More of
our ongoing interview with Peter O'Leary will go on in the next issue.

We are still poetry for the next issue on an ongoing basis; if you
have not heard back from us we promise we will get to you in the next
few weeks. Additionally, we want to encourage readers to submit to our
Short Pieces category. These can look like essays, blog entries,
correspondence pieces (like Thomas and Steven), etc. Use your
creativity! We like weird things, normal things, essay things, and
anything related to Apocalypticism.

Sincerely,

Jamie and Jeff

Please check out my entry on poet Phil Hall for the Canadian Encyclopedia:

http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/phil-hall

"In the pivotal collection *Hearthedral: A Folk-Hermetic* (1996), Phil
Hall's poetic shift becomes more apparent. It shows his transition from
relatively accessible poetry using colloquial realism into more complex
language reminiscent of James Joyce's wordplay in *Finnegans Wake* and
Gerard Manley Hopkins' richly descriptive poetry. . . ."

Cheers,
Camille Martin

Hi all,

Back in 2000, Kristin Prevallet and Prageeta Sharma were kind enough
to ask Aaron Kiely and me to read in the Segue series in NYC, then
housed at Double Happiness.

I'd been emailed a link recently to the PennSound site through the
Poetics List, and I saw that a recording of our event wasn't on the
site. Then I remembered that the recording equipment wasn't working
that day, and I did what I usually did back then and recorded it with
my little Radio Shack cassette recorder.

I checked the kitchen drawer where I thought the tape was and, sure
enough, there it was. Our pal Sean Cole was kind enough to digitize
the cassette, and the good folks at Penn Sound have now put the
recordings up on their swell site

Go down to April 8 and there are the links to each of our readings
(and a ton of other recordings, too):

http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Segue-DH.php

Hope yre all doing well.

as ever,
dak

   =E2=80=9CWhat happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it b=

   Poets have done beautiful things with typography=E2=80=94Apollinaire=E2=
=80=99s
   Calligrammes, that sort of thing. But now we are left with people who

   =E2=80=9CThe publisher is considered, especially in Anglo-Saxon countri=
es, a
   rather eccentric entrepreneur or impresario=E2=80=94a businessman in a=
 very
   improbable field. But if he is successful, then he is a good
   businessman. The author is the successor of the saint, everyone

   =E2=80=9CI never admitted it of course, never admitted to being an arti=

   all. Not after the first years, when I was in fact a minor juvenile
   artist. Unlike other so-called artists, I never boasted of being an
   artist, and especially not of being a literary artist. I was a secret
   artist. For most of my adult life I was a collector of paintings and a
   concealed minor artist. I would not admit it because I could not accept
   the status of minor artist, what I considered the disgrace of the minor
   artist. I could have been a successful minor artist, but instead I was
   a failure as a major artist. I was a concealed failure as a major
   artist. By concealing the artist I was able to conceal the failure.=E2=

Along with fronting the Gris Gris, singer/songwriter/guitarist Greg =20
Ashley also performs as a solo artist, concentrating on the delicately =20=

trippy psych-folk that occasionally makes its way into his band=92s =20
louder, more unpredictable music. Late in 2003, Birdman released his =20
debut album, Medicine Fuck Dream, which drew comparisons to Mayo =20
Thompson and Roky Erickson. Ashley=92s second solo album, Painted =20
Garden, arrived early in 2007, and though it had considerably cleaner =20=

production than his debut, it shared the same free-flowing songwriting =20=

and surreal lyrics. In 2010 he dropped the completely experimental =20
Requiem Mass and Other Experiments on Birdman. The opening title track =20=

(a whole side of a conventional LP) is the preeminent work here, while =20=

My new book of poems, Wild Dialectics, is now out with Shearsman Books

http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2012/samuelsWD.html

With thanks to the publisher, Tony Frazer, and to Laura McLauchlan for
the cover art's chthonic marketplace.
Bests, Lisa

Lisa Samuels's Wild Dialectics forges imaginary rhythms into
speculative anthems. These lyrics of elusive logos ghost provisional
conditions of enduring transience. With stunning poise, Samuels holds
out for holding on to the inherent insistence of words' translucent
pilgrimage.
=97Charles Bernstein

I am profoundly moved by Wild Dialectics, doing one of the best kinds
of work that a poet and her poetry can do. Experience and perception
are fully nuanced here, compressed into the body-mind of a guide to
the full if even at times partial details; a rewire, making possible
and thereby making accessible.
Wild Dialectics is resonant with sense and fat with the joy of humane
linguistic creative subtlety. The ear and eye, body and mind, are
jumped into serious play both along and between these lines. Lisa
Samuels tells it straight and tells it true; which is why we might not
see that to be so, we are not used to straight and true. Her attention
and perceptions are sharp as they come, subtle arguments released
through sensual fracture.

Boog City 73

featuring:

***Our Occupy at One Section***

with:

=97"=91One of my hopes,=92 says Fagin, =91is always that people will =
claim =20
their own authority and empower themselves to meet their own needs and =20=

those of their communities.=92" from "Stacking Up: Betsy Fagin on Occupy =
=20
and The People=92s Library," interview and introductory piece by =20
Christophe Casamassima

=97Essays from the panel discussion =93Never-Ending Participation: =20
Activism and Occupy Wall Street=94 that took place in August at the 6th =20=

annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music festival. Featuring:

*"What exactly do we want to change? How are we actively envisioning a =20=

different organizational system for humans that has less to do with =20
utopian musings (so as to avoid utopia=92s critical failure to find its =20=

referent in an actual existing reality)." from =93Never-Ending =20
Participation: Activism and Occupy Wall Street=94 by Brenda Iijima

*"Activism by poets and artists abounds in our time within and without =20=

aesthetic communities. And the poems, to my mind, are often more =20
substantial for this involvement." from Can You Remain a Poet and Be =20
an Activist? by Thom Donovan

*"As this uncertainty is the very premise of any ethical practice=97=20
aesthetic or political, cultural or social=97it is also the very ground =20=

of responsibility, not only to our histories but also to our present, =20=

when and wherever that is." from Occupation Everywhere: Poetry and =20
Politics by Tyrone Williams


**=46rom our Occupy-themed Music section, edited by Jonathan Berger**

=97"=91We played for hours and hours, so often I would throw in a theme; =
=20
some jazz here, some hip-hop there. Crowds would always go nuts when =20
they heard me throw in some of =93Mas Que Nada,=94 by Sergio Mendes, or =20=

=93Rockit=94 by Herbie Hancock.=92"  from Brother to All: Brer Brian=92s =
=20
Occupy by Berger

=97"Despite the collective decisioning and the signs and the chants, all =
=20
fundamental aspects of my Occupation, The People Staged was, to me, =20
the creative heart of Occupy Wall Street." from Occu-Folk: The =20
Soundtrack to the Movement by Tim Barker

**And Occupy-themed work from our Poetry section, edited by Buck Downs**
(excerpts below)

=97David Buuck
Oakland, Calif.
 =46rom =91Mayday Mayday=92
A test of poetry:
		To read this aloud
			To sound it in the mouth
		Which one does in the body
		In the moment of its actioning
	But not when reading
	Not when scanning the screen feeds
			Which is a different rhythm
		In one=92s body
			An anxious sense of time
	Moving too fast
		To make tactical decisions
				Appropriate to the conditions

=97Eliot Katz
Hoboken, N.J.
Even a Poet Laureate
Doesn=92t Deserve
to Get Beaten by the Police
As someone who doesn=92t care much
about government awards or titles
given to artists, I still say a 70-year-old
former Poet Laureate of the United States
should have some extra layer of protection
from getting beaten with billy clubs
by a Berkeley police-riot squad.


***And Our Non-Occupy Content***

**from our Printed Matter section**

=97" This is where how to survive begins. A rejected lover is a writer =20=

whose narrator infuses every scene with a theme of love, of doom, of =20
pain." from Wong Revives the Heroic Victim; how to survive a hotel =20
fire by Angela Veronica Wong (Coconut Books), reviewed by Abby Hagler

=97"This is Gray=92s great gift: electric she reaches out.  Her poems =
are =20
tough and fragile and wrong and a conversation about making it right." =20=

from Stephanie Gray Matters; I Thought You Said it was Sound/How Does =20=

that Sound by Stephanie Gray (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs), reviewed =20=

by Chris Martin

=97"Walker=92s soaring popularity prompted Time magazine to name him =20

Dyn-o-mite; =20
Dyn-o-mite: Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times-A Memoir by Jimmie Walker =20=

with Sal Manna (Da Capo Press), reviewed by Risa Morley


**from our Small Press section, now edited by Kimberly Ann Southwick**

=97"It=92s fun taking a piece of scrap paper that would otherwise go =
into =20
the recycle bin and having a dozen ideas pop into my head. This could =20=

be a gift tag! A greeting card! A bookmark! It fits into our aesthetic =20=

in a sense that I try and use as much repurposed material as =20

study other writers' notebooks (Bernadette Mayer, James Joyce, John
Wieners, Allen Ginsberg, James Schuyler, etc). Beginning October 8, 2012,
Monday evenings 6 pm-8:30 pm, 10 sessions, $300. Limit eight students.

"I think that at its base creativity involves undoing
systems."<http://www.full-stop.net/2012/09/18/features/the-editors/teaching-in-the-margins-michael-joyce/>

Michael Joyce, "grandaddy of hypertext fictions" talks to Full Stop about
Deleuze, the difference between experimental and innovative, and the
pleasure of acts of reading, as part of the series Teaching in the Margins.
With Teaching in the Margins Full Stop looks to poets, novelists, educators
and academics to survey the state of the humanities and explore the
relationship between innovative writing and pedagogy.

You can find the interview here:

Please feel free to post, link, tweet or otherwise share. And thanks so
much for your help and interest.

Dear colleagues,

Humbly requesting a listen and perhaps a vote.  The winning tracks will be

you would vote me or spread the link, I would appreciate it. I am
fascinated by this project.  It's part of Design Philadelphia.

Application Deadline: =0AOctober 1, 2012=0A=A0=0AThe Millay Colony for the =
Arts offers one-month residencies to six visual artists, writers and compos=
ers each month between the months of April and November. Nurturing the work=
 of artists of all ages, from a range of cultures and communities, and in a=
ll stages of their artistic career, the Colony offers comfortable private r=
ooms, private studio spaces and ample time to work in a quiet, pastoral atm=
osphere. =0A=A0=0AUnlike other residency programs, we are small in size and=
 we do not emphasize social events or visits from professionals in the fiel=
d. We believe we can offer artists nothing more precious than the chance to=
 work, and we provide everything an artist needs to organize her/his time f=
or maximum productivity. The Colony does not oblige residents to participat=
e in any events, nor are residents required to share or donate work.=0A=A0=
=0AOur campus is located on the property where the poet Edna St. Vincent Mi=
llay lived at the height of her literary career, starting in the 1920s. We =
have a seven-acre campus with meadows and forest in Austerlitz, New York, a=
djacent to the former Millay home and gardens and the exquisite Harvey Moun=
tain State Forest. Our residents have access to trails for hiking and bicyc=
les, meadows for picnics (with wild blueberry, wild thyme and an incredible=
 mix of plants and flowers) and creeks and streams for cooling off. In the =
Winter, residents may choose to go cross-country skiing.=0A=A0=0AEach year =
Millay Colony invites 52 visual artists, writers and composers for a colony=
 residency.  Residents are chosen anonymously by a panel of jurors in each =
discipline.  The application process is competitive and based solely on on =
the merit of the artist statement and work sample.=A0 =0A=A0=0AThe Millay C=
olony for the Arts is pleased to announce that, starting this year, we are =
adding three new offerings to our roster of artist residencies on its pasto=
ral upstate New York/Berkshire   area campus. While continuing to offer mon=
th-long residencies to visual artists,   writers and composers, the Millay =
Colony is now offering three new ways to spend   time as a resident: Two-we=
ek Residencies in the month of September, Virtual Residencies and Group Res=
idencies.=0A=A0=0AThe Millay Colony accepts residents on the basis of artis=
tic merit.  Our admissions policy does not discriminate with regard to race=

Granary Books is pleased to offer for sale a selection of striking =
collages and collage books created by poet, novelist, editor, artist, =
publisher, and teacher Lewis Warsh.

This coincides with the just-released issue of "Mimeo Mimeo" (a magazine =
edited by Kyle Schlesinger and Jed Birmingham about "artist's books, =
typography & the mimeo revolution") devoted to the work of Warsh, a =
poet, novelist, publisher, artist, and teacher.

We've published several projects with Lewis over the years including: =
"Bustin's Island '68," a work which asks for a new rubric, call it a =
"poet's" book; "The Angel Hair Anthology," a massive gathering from the =
formative magazine and press he edited with Anne Waldman in the sixties =
and seventies; "Inseparable: Poems 1995-2005," with a Warsh cover =
collage; and "Debtor's Prison," a collaboration with visual artist Julie =
Harrison.

It is therefore a special privilege to share a rarely glimpsed but most =
important aspect of Warsh's practice since 1996. His collages seem a =
natural if not inevitable extension of his writing, and portray a visual =
dimension that is sumptuous, alluring and mysterious.

A request to the list:

One of my colleagues in my community college English department has =
recently published a book of poems, and he's starving for some =
intelligent reviews, perhaps by someone with a working knowledge of =
post-colonialism. If any of you can take that on, I can get the book to =
you post haste, and would appreciate it greatly for him.

Please let me know back-channel to jsafdie@roadrunner.com, and thanks in =
advance.

My box of LOOMS has arrived, fresh from Shearsman Books. The publisher's
webpage offers a pdf sample as well as a handy list of links where you can
order the book:

http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2012/martinLooms.html

Many thanks to Tony Frazer, publisher extraordinaire of Shearsman Books.

May the poems in LOOMS bring you pleasure. Reviews welcome.

Cheers,
Camille Martin

The title of LOOMS signifies the weaving tool as well as the shadowing
appearance of something. These "woven tales" were inspired by Barbara
Guest's statement that a tale "doesn't tell the truth about itself; it
tells us what it dreams about." The strands of their surreal allegories
converse, one idea giving rise to another, and the paths of their dialogue
become the fabric of the narrative. In a second meaning, something that
looms remains in a state of imminent arrival. Such are these tales, like
parables with infinitely deferred lessons.

"In tightly woven tapestry, Martin's 'backstreet songs' re-invent a music
of knowledge that navigates the hucksterism and catastrophe threatening our
planet. The movement of her threads is fugue-like, punctuated by oboes and
clarinets, mockingbirds and cicadas. Here, in the dream-space of time-lapse
film, forms of life and ideas collide and morph, rippling through centuries
of human consciousness to unravel as quickly as they ravel. Here, above
all, Martin makes it possible to dance among our 'origins in snake oil,'
our 'crusades to mirages' and our 'accidental fictions'."=97Meredith
Quartermain

"A dreamscape on the outskirts of town, 'in the badlands of the
vernacular,' these hopeful, haunted poems populated by children and
prisoners 'hover between' realms domestic and exterior, real and imagined.
Like candles described herein, this book gives off a melting, tactile glow.=
"

Hi all,

We've just been fortunate to add to our Occupy issue:

Pictures from the Occupation
Images and Text by Lee Ranaldo

"Living down in lower Manhattan has been pretty wild for the last =20
decade, to say the least, with the occupation of Zuccotti Park/Liberty =20=

Plaza last fall being only the latest happening of note. I spent a lot =20=

of time in the park, brought my kids by to see this free-speech city =20
growing there (and later to also see it swept out by the powers that =20
be.)."

The updated online pdf of Boog City 73, our Occupy at One issue, our =20
biggest non-Portable Boog Reader issue ever, is now available. You can =20=

Boog City 73

featuring:

***Our Occupy at One Section***

with:

=97"=91One of my hopes,=92 says Fagin, =91is always that people will =
claim =20
their own authority and empower themselves to meet their own needs and =20=

those of their communities.=92" from "Stacking Up: Betsy Fagin on Occupy =
=20
and The People=92s Library," interview and introductory piece by

=97Essays from the panel discussion =93Never-Ending Participation: =20
Activism and Occupy Wall Street=94 that took place in August at the 6th =20=

annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music festival. Featuring:

*"What exactly do we want to change? How are we actively envisioning a =20=

different organizational system for humans that has less to do with =20
utopian musings (so as to avoid utopia=92s critical failure to find its =20=

referent in an actual existing reality)." from =93Never-Ending =20
Participation: Activism and Occupy Wall Street=94 by Brenda Iijima

*"Activism by poets and artists abounds in our time within and without =20=

aesthetic communities. And the poems, to my mind, are often more =20
substantial for this involvement." from Can You Remain a Poet and Be =20
an Activist? by Thom Donovan

*"As this uncertainty is the very premise of any ethical practice=97=20
aesthetic or political, cultural or social=97it is also the very ground =20=

of responsibility, not only to our histories but also to our present, =20=

when and wherever that is." from Occupation Everywhere: Poetry and =20
Politics by Tyrone Williams


**=46rom our Occupy-themed Music section, edited by Jonathan Berger**

=97"=91We played for hours and hours, so often I would throw in a theme; =
=20
some jazz here, some hip-hop there. Crowds would always go nuts when =20
they heard me throw in some of =93Mas Que Nada,=94 by Sergio Mendes, or =20=

=93Rockit=94 by Herbie Hancock.=92"  from Brother to All: Brer Brian=92s =
=20
Occupy by Berger

=97"Despite the collective decisioning and the signs and the chants, all =
=20
fundamental aspects of my Occupation, The People Staged was, to me, =20
the creative heart of Occupy Wall Street." from Occu-Folk: The =20
Soundtrack to the Movement by Tim Barker

**And Occupy-themed work from our Poetry section, edited by Buck Downs**
(excerpts below)

=97David Buuck
Oakland, Calif.
 =46rom =91Mayday Mayday=92
A test of poetry:
		To read this aloud
			To sound it in the mouth
		Which one does in the body
		In the moment of its actioning
	But not when reading
	Not when scanning the screen feeds
			Which is a different rhythm
		In one=92s body
			An anxious sense of time
	Moving too fast
		To make tactical decisions
				Appropriate to the conditions

=97Eliot Katz
Hoboken, N.J.
Even a Poet Laureate
Doesn=92t Deserve
to Get Beaten by the Police
As someone who doesn=92t care much
about government awards or titles
given to artists, I still say a 70-year-old
former Poet Laureate of the United States
should have some extra layer of protection
from getting beaten with billy clubs
by a Berkeley police-riot squad.


***And Our Non-Occupy Content***

**from our Printed Matter section**

=97" This is where how to survive begins. A rejected lover is a writer =20=

whose narrator infuses every scene with a theme of love, of doom, of =20
pain." from Wong Revives the Heroic Victim; how to survive a hotel =20
fire by Angela Veronica Wong (Coconut Books), reviewed by Abby Hagler

=97"This is Gray=92s great gift: electric she reaches out.  Her poems =
are =20
tough and fragile and wrong and a conversation about making it right." =20=

from Stephanie Gray Matters; I Thought You Said it was Sound/How Does =20=

that Sound by Stephanie Gray (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs), reviewed =20=

by Chris Martin

**from our Small Press section, now edited by Kimberly Ann Southwick**

=97"It=92s fun taking a piece of scrap paper that would otherwise go =
into =20
the recycle bin and having a dozen ideas pop into my head. This could =20=

be a gift tag! A greeting card! A bookmark! It fits into our aesthetic =20=

in a sense that I try and use as much repurposed material as =20
possible." from "Ghost Writers: Exploring Greying Ghost Press" by =20

I spent five days

In your dog pound
Recently

Of the 9/11 memorial

The cold harbor
Of St. Patrick=92s Cathedral

I understand Gotham

Suddenly Mountain Night
breathing like an internal sculptor or a baker using flour from =20
several continents
with varied social norms, introducing whats introduced.
no one can talk the eggs into opening, maybe because they have no limbs,
because their geometry encloses their universe, fasts meant to be =20

stirred by wind, yeasted by wind,

We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly o=
ut-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed .=
 . . yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us t=
o ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty whe=
re no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented =
as separation.

          =97Adrienne Rich


Dear Poets who support Obama :::: :


Please consider organizing a POETRY READING . . .

in support of OBAMA in your town or city in the coming month and a half.

If/when you do, please write me with the details and I will post it here ::=

It is difficult
to get the news from poems
yet men die miserably every day
for lack
of what is found there.
                  =97William Carlos Williams


In the weeks following 9/11 New York City bookstores reported selling more =
poetry than ever before.  In times of public and private crisis people seem=
 to understand intuitively that uncomplicated answers and simplistic narrat=
ives are not going to suffice.  Instead, they seek out more complex renditi=
ons of what it means to be human like those found in poetry. Might we say t=
hat we are now, also, in an instance (or a multitude of instances) of publi=
c and political crisis?  How might we, as poets who continue to believe in =
the change that Obama stands for and wants to continue to work toward, beha=
ve civically and hopefully during these pre-election months?

Let us gather at poetry readings across the country and read work that chal=
lenges the notion that contemporary poets are trapped in their own atomized=
 worlds. Let=92s continue to try to give new voice to the individual experi=
ences sometimes forgotten in accounts of today's large events, and show tha=
t civic engagement is alive and well in the palm of poetry. Let's fill the =
corridors with words, breath, song, lament, prayer, pulse. Let's be human t=
ogether. Let's echo & & &. Let's.

Would anyone know the title of this poem (partial) by Harry Martinson:

The interior table was set,
But only a few came
and only a few of those were capable of eating.

If so, please write to me directly:

**Greying Ghost Press
http://www.greyingghost.com
Greying Ghost started in March of 2007. Since the very beginning they =20=

have had the pleasure of working with many exceptional authors whose =20
commitment to expanding the power of the written word has energized =20
their commitment to print their work. All of its books are handmade =20
and, in most cases, every aspect of production is done in-house. This =20=

includes the processes of printing, binding, and shipping. Each cover =20=

is hand stamped or pressed. And all of its mail orders are stuffed =20
full with either old photos, fragments of old maps and books, comic =20
scraps, or, most importantly, FREE* pamphlets of poems by people they =20=

admire.

The music Hack writes is always based on meaningful world issues, =20
events, and experiences. Her song, "Saya Tidak Bersalah" (I'm not =20
Guilty), is a song about an Australian woman wrongfully imprisoned in =20=

Indonesia. Her song fueled an international human rights campaign and =20=

Santa Rosa, Calif. (September 19, 2012) =96 September 29, 2012 marks the
second

annual global event for 100 Thousand Poets for Change, a grassroots
organization that brings communities together to call for environmental,
social, and political change within the framework of peace and
sustainability. An event that began primarily with poet organizers, 100
Thousand Poets for Change has grown into an interdisciplinary coalition
with year round events which includes musicians, dancers, mimes, painters
and photographers from around the world.



Local issues are still key to this massive global event as communities
around the world raise their voices on issues such as homelessness, global
warming, education, racism and censorship, through concerts, readings,
lectures, workshops, flash mobs, theater performances and other actions.



But these locally focused events have taken on a more continuous and
expansive form through the new disciplines represented this year. For
example, photographers are making a long-term project out of the event;
they will document the involvement of their communities and explore
connections with the broader global issues to turn into future exhibits. Mo=
re
and more organizers and participants of the one day, annual event are
making plans to continue their actions after September 29. Many have formed
groups in their cities that will continue to work year-round towards the
goals their community seeks.



=93Peace and sustainability are major concerns worldwide, and the guiding
principles for this global event,=94 said Michael Rothenberg, Co-Founder of
100 Thousand Poets for Change. =93We are in a world where it isn't just one
issue that needs to be addressed. A common ground is built through this
global compilation of local stories, which is how we create a true
narrative for discourse to inform the future.=94



More than 200 hundred bands will be performing around the world, from Los
Angeles, New Orleans and Detroit to Serbia, Nigeria and Italy. The
musicians involved in this movement are once again using their songs and
performances to try to communicate their concerns to the world. As Ross
Altman, singer-songwriter, activist and educator, reminds us: =93from Plato=
,
who banned [musicians] from the Republic, to Putin, who had Russian punk
band members of Pussy Riot arrested, charged, tried, convicted and
sentenced to two years in prison for a song prayer, musicians throughout
history have been regarded as a danger and threat to change the social
order.=94



In addition to the hundreds of musicians expressing themselves through
song, numerous Mimes for Change events in Egypt, Turkey and Uruguay will
take place in addition to the day long poetry festivals in Los Angeles,
Guatemala City, Pune, India, La Plata, Argentina and Genoa, Italy;
thousands of musicians, poets and artists are participating around the
world, totaling nearly 800 events globally, including:



=95 25 different events in the San Francisco Bay Area, the birthplace of 10=
0
Thousand Poets for Change, including poetry readings by Beat Legend Michael
McClure, former US Poet Laureate Robert Hass and other major poets at the
famed Watershed Environmental Poetry Festival



=95 In New Orleans <http://100tmc.com/>, 15 live bands will perform to rais=
e
funds for the APEX Youth Center and Homegrown Harvest Music and Arts
Festival



=95 In Hollywood, Florida, Global Vibes will host an event called, =93War
Destroys Children=92s Lives=94 at two venues and feature over 15 =93Bands f=
or
Change=94



=95 Peace On Streets, R.O.A.D., Tasker Elite and SHARP will host performanc=
e
artists, poets, musicians, hip hop artists and various youth and parent
groups who will perform and lead workshops throughout Philadelphia to bring
awareness to the ongoing problem of street violence in their city



=95 Wordstock, a 3-day festival at the Bamboo Arts and Celebration Center i=
n
De Leon Springs, FL will include poetry slams, concerts, and an art
exhibition focusing on images of war and peace



*=95 The Occupy Wall Street Poetry group kicks off a weekend of events in N=
ew
York City with a poetry reading at the famous St. Mark=92s Poetry Project*



=95 In Jamaica, a week long Street Dub Vibe series called =93Tell the Child=
ren
the Truth=94 will include concerts, spoken word performances, art exhibits,
lectures and workshops to bring attention to the damaging culture of
secrecy and denial surrounding the abuse, poverty and illiteracy impacting
the nation=92s children and destroying their future.



=95 Poetry and peace gatherings are planned in the strife-torn cities of
Kabul and

Jalalabad, Afghanistan



=95 In Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, poets, musicians and mime artists, in
response to violence in the world and the major changes taking place in the
Arab World, will perform in public spaces and theaters and explore new ways
to communicate their concerns, and their roles as artists, in influencing
the future of their country



=95 In Volos, Greece, there will be 5 days of poetry and music events,
including an

exhibition of photography looking at the new phenomenon of homelessness in
Greece



=95 An event in Blackpool, England will celebrate activist poets and writer=
s
of past

generations through a special performance of *Bullets and Daffodils,* a
play about the life of peace poet Wilfred Owen



Organizers and participants are hoping through their actions and events to
seize and redirect the political and social dialogue of the day and turn
the narrative of civilization towards peace and sustainability. Those that
want to get involved can visit www.100tpc.org to find an event near them or
sign up to organize one in their area.



About 100 Thousand Poets for Change

100 Thousand Poets for Change began in Sonoma County, Calif. The official

Headquarters=92 Event will take place at the Arlene Francis Center in
downtown Santa Rosa and will feature poetry readings, group meditations,
workshops, and music and dance of various styles including hip hop,
flamenco, African drums, reggae, salsa, folk and more. The HQ event will
also live-stream other 100 Thousand Poets for Change events worldwide. This
3-day event is sponsored by the Peace & Justice Center of Sonoma County and
the Sonoma County Arts Council.



Immediately following September 29th, all documentation on the 100TPC.org
website, which will include specific event pages with photos, video and
other documentation compiled by each city coordinator, will be preserved by
Stanford University in California. Stanford recognized 100 Thousand Poets
for Change in 2011 as an historical event, the largest poetry reading in
history. They will continue to archive the complete contents of 100TPC.org,
as part of their digital archiving program LOCKSS.
