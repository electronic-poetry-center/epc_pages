dear POETICS,

Out from the lurking realm of the unknown dimension, I'd like to introduce
myself & share some things this fine Nov.1st. My name is Danny Snelson --
I've been on the server for some time, popping up occasional here & there --
I've been meaning to join proper for some time but have not been able in the
shuffle recently relocated to Tokyo. Some may have seen my web work -- I
began scanning/contributing to Craig Dworkin's inimitable eclipse
archive<http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/>a few years ago, edited the
recent Spring 2007 series of /ubu
editions <http://www.ubu.com/ubu/> & have done various
things<http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/page-0-9.html>with the good
people at Ugly Duckling Presse (wherein one mad-cap afternoon
I retyped the entirety of Aram Saroyan's minimal
poems<http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/page-Complete.html>for
(re)publication). I sharity blog
here <http://jhenrychunko.blogspot.com/>.

Writing now with the distinct pleasure to announce the launch debut of my Dear
coUntess, a letter to lord kelvin <http://my-Dear-coUntess.blogspot.com> --
a feature length conceptual writing project. Blazon: it considers
contemporary epistolary forms, digital translation methods & the preeminent
mode of confessional poetry 2.0 -- the vlog (or video blog) -- exhuming a
telepathic letter you may recognize as once being transmitted by the
posthumous soul of Dr. Faustroll as printed in Opinions &
Exploits<http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:eOkr8XjVsP0J:www.pataphysics-lab.com/sarcophaga/daysures/Jarry,%252520Alfred%252520-%252520Dr%252520Faustroll.rtf+opinions+and+exploits+faustroll&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=35>well
after the dismal demise of Alfred Jarry (now back in
stock <http://www.exactchange.com/frame/frame.html>!).

Further, keep on the watch -- the coUntess will be part of the
(mis)Translation folio in Drunken Boat #9,
<http://www.drunkenboat.com><http://www.drunkenboat.com/>forthcoming
in Winter 2007. The folio will include magpie steals,
transinhalations, computational recreations, transealations, straight and
vexed translations, from French to French and from Bach to Fortran. (Sez

granted, i'm not an incredibly experienced or well-published poet, but this
is the first time i've ever heard of such a thing!

i checked the website and found no transparent display of cost (you have to
send a personal email to request it) and am still baffled as to how said
conference is supposed to benefit a poet or manuscript.

it almost seems as if you're paying (after being selected to
participate/pay) for a small audience with two publishers.  the website
boasts that 13 manuscripts workshopped at the conference have been
published; my question is, by the editors in attendance?

I'm still a novice at Language. I see it as a liberating trend, but recently, while reading Borges, I found myself nostalgic for more narrative in contemporary poetry. Borges, in "The Craft of Verse," seems to regret the absence of narrative in 20th century poetry. In his "Tape for the Turn of The Year," A. R. Ammons seems to have anticipated the LANGUAGE aesthetic (if aesthetic is the correct word). I consider the Tape an awesome poem. The reader never knows where Ammons will take one from one line to the next. & while there's seldom, if ever, a narrative in an Ammons poem, lots of things happen. There's action. I like that.

I'm lucky, I don't like eggs, :-)

Anny, Gabrielle and everyone,
What I omitted from this recipe was my true intention.
Yes, it was meant for Catherine and her collection.
But mostly it is my peace offering to the Middle East and the whole world
looking about to be blown up. See, I figure, if
ANYONEANYWHEREANYTIMEFOREVERMORE sits and eats this pavlova:
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE EATING THIS PAVLOVA IS GONNA THINK A BIT ABOUT
WAR OR WHO SIDE THEY'RE ON AND AFTERWARDS HERE'S THE BEST PART: you need
a nap--you've absolutely gotta sleep after eating this...
Nowaynohow to blow up self and others in past-pavlova euphoria.
So this is MY OFFERING FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
(i do pray it works...please "focus on pavlova"--world of ours pathetic mess)

"Looking back at my posts of September 1997, I see a young man ill
equipped to participate in the environment of the Buffalo Poetics
List. I trust that person (my old self), and his instinctive gestures
and claims: but I cringe at his "parodic redeployments" (though I
embrace his lack of theoretical sophistication). Still, if his
vocabulary had been better constructed, perhaps his entrance on the
List would have been eased. And, thinking of Derrida's On
Hospitality, it is true that we do not get to choose who enters our
domains. This creates opportunities for discussion and reflection
through confrontation with the other-in whatever context you want to
define other. Theorized through this notion of hospitality, Derrida
suggests that "tolerance" draws boundaries that prevent engagements
with the other. Such "tolerance" is unproductive in terms of
communication. By testing one's identity in a context in which the
other arrives to challenge us, we can develop strong arguments that
further conversation without retreating into the safe categories of
being we claim to protect us from the dynamic arguments of others."...

"Language" in of itself does not reject "narrative."  See Carla Harryman,
West Coast Language poet, in her short piece about narrative (There Never
Was a Rose...), which I think makes a profound statement on this front.   I
think there's a difference between  anti-narrative and non/narrative.  The
anti-narrative might be Don Quixote, Cervantes-style, a work that parodies
or rejects narrative through its own "wandering."  Non/narrative is a
critique of the "master narratives" that create a lyric poem, for example
(or a story or novel) before it is even written. They are implicit and part
of the culture, and adapted and re-adapted, like the Hollywood stories.

These kind of narratives are a far cry from Borges, whose labyrinth approach
to "plot" is a critique of its own plotted-out tradition.

We should have more like Borges.  When Laura Mulvey famously discounted
narrative (narrative as "sadism," as the infamous "male gaze"), she was
specifically talking about the narratives of Hollywood "masters" (Hitchcock
was her target), and the specific "realist" plots that "plot again" women.
This is the idea of narrative as closure and linearity, not as critique or
questioning the "naturalness" of the text.

Laura

At the risk of sticking my foot into the great unspoken "it" of this list, =
I have always (as a reader for over 30 years) considered L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=
=3DA=3DG=3DE as a technique more than an aesthetic: one which would natural=
ly devolve in much the same way that surrealistic touches replaced the tota=
l embrace of full-blown surrealistic effluents in the fifties, sixties and =
seventies.  =0A    Schools of poetry seem to have a life-span where adheren=
ts flourish, immerse themselves, and then several of the prime practitioner=
s synthesize the best practices and move on: witness the more recent poetry=
 of Charles Bernstein -- one would be hard pressed to call it "pure" langua=
ge; it has moved into a sort of cross-pollinated narrative/polemic impulse.=
 I like it much better than his "pure" language works. I think there are va=
st unexplored potentials in cross pollinating language elements with narrat=
ive structures, andI like the idea that as one gets older one gets better. =
 =0A    Like the history of surrealism I foresee the future of "language" e=
lements in American poetry as becoming a non-linear flourish in service of =
a rhetoric in search of greater clarity and precision, and not as an end in=
 itself -- an interlude within the structure of an over-arching poem rather=
 than the dominant concern of poem itself.  When a movement becomes a usefu=
l trope in the ongoing rhetoric of the humanities then that movement has do=
ne something very useful in the history of mankind.  =0A    Ur poemslike Am=
mons' "Tape..."(it's influence goes beyond "language" to  second generation=

Yahoo in apology on China

By Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington and Mure Dickie in Beijing

Published: November 1 2007 20:29 | Last updated: November 1 2007 20:29

A top Yahoo official who has come under fire for the company=92s role in
the 2004 imprisonment of a dissident in China apologised on Thursday for
failing to tell US lawmakers that Yahoo knew more about the case than he
initially acknowledged in testimony last year.

Michael Callahan, Yahoo=92s executive vice president and general counsel,
said in a statement ahead of a congressional hearing next week that he
=93realised=94 that Yahoo had additional information about the nature of the
probe into one of its users, Shi Tao, a journalist now serving a 10-year
prison sentence in China, months after he testified that Yahoo had =93no
information=94 about the investigation.

Yahoo has faced intense criticism for its involvement in the case
because, according to US lawmakers, police in Beijing only found Mr Shi
after Yahoo provided them with his e-mail account, IP address log-on
history, and the contents of his e-mails.

According to the lawmakers, at the time of Mr Callahan=92s earlier
testimony Yahoo was in possession of a 2004 order issued by the Chinese
government.

The order said that authorities were seeking information about a user on
suspicions that he =93illegally provided state secrets to foreign
entities=94 =96 a charge that is often invoked in cases involving political
dissidents.

=93Months after I testified before two House subcommittees on Yahoo=92s
approach to business in China, I realised Yahoo had additional
information about a 2004 order issued by the Chinese government seeking
information about a Yahoo China user,=94 Mr Callahan said in the
statement.

The existence of the order was made public after a San Francisco-based
human rights group released the documents.

=93I neglected to directly alert the committee of this new information and
that oversight led to a misunderstanding that I deeply regret and have
apologised to the committee for creating,=94 Mr Callahan said.

He added that in consultations with committee staff they agreed that his
2006 testimony was =93truthful=94.

He is expected to testify that a lawyer for Yahoo in Asia failed to
brief him on the order because the lawyer did not believe it was
significant.

The apology marks a shift in strategy at Yahoo, to strike a more
conciliatory tone. Last month, the company said it was =93grossly unfair=94
that the company was being singled out by lawmakers on the House foreign
relations committee for giving false information to Congress.

Jerry Yang, Yahoo=92s chief executive, will also testify at the hearing
next week, and is expected to highlight the challenges US businesses
face in countries that restrict access to information.

Yahoo gave up direct control of its China operations when it sold them
to the Chinese business website Alibaba in 2005 after failing to come up
with a business strategy that would enable it to win a significant share
of the local internet portal market.

Yahoo could still be vulnerable to future human rights-related cases
involving Yahoo China, since Alibaba=92s boss, Jack Ma, made no secret of
his willingness to co-operate closely with Beijing=92s authorities and
with any investigations into users.

  Through my experience with foetry I have found that assuming that the material was written by anyone other than the owner would not hold weight in general. From being a anonymous website, to revealing who "you" are, to creating an anonymous blog, to not choosing to justify your accusations with fact, to waiting for nearly six months to respond to charges leveled against you'all, to not allowing me to respond to unfounded accusations made against us and people I know, to having multiple addresses contact me to refute such charges, to those individuals (some purporting to be you, others just privy to the "info I sent," and copying that material in their accusatory material, to appearances on your website without permission, to my offering to sue you if the material was not removed, to someone removing the material and so on, I cannot say that one speaks as "being" from foetry has any weight. From editors, poets, and others on the end of your wrath that I have spoken with
 this is common. Accuse first, find out facts later. Your pseudonomynous existence makes it so that it is unclear who is speaking. Sorry you create so much confusion. Perhaps this blueholz thing is you. Or another screen to hide behind.

You know, I think it would be great to look at such pavlova as a model for
poetry.  I would like to write poems that so occupy the mind that one cannot
think of war while reading them and that give one enough information to
process that the brain demands a nap.

Wikipedia Becomes a Class Assignment
By JESSICA MINTZ, AP Technology Writer

http://www.physorg.com/news113071167.html

(AP) -- Some academics cringe when students turn to Wikipedia as a
reference for term papers.

Instead of asking students in her environmental history course to
turn in one big paper at the end of the semester, she requires them
either to write an original Wikipedia article or to do a major edit
on an existing one.

The inspiration came to her as she prepared teaching materials for
her class.

"I would find these things on Wikipedia," she said, and would think,
"Gosh, this is awfully thin here. I wonder if my students could fill
this in?"

Wikipedia has been vilified as a petri dish for misinformation, and
the variable accuracy of its articles is a point Groom readily
concedes. Since the advent of the Web, she said, the quality of
sources students cite has deteriorated.

For her students, the Wikipedia experiment was "transformative," and
students' writing online proved better than the average undergrad
research paper.

Knowing their work was headed for the Web, not just one harried
professor's eyes, helped students reach higher - as did the standards
set by the volunteer "Wikipedians" who police entries for accuracy
and neutral tone, Groom said.

The exercise also gave students a taste of working in the real world
of peer-reviewed research.

Most of the articles were well received, but Groom said some students
caught heat from Wikipedia editors for doing exactly what college
students are trained to do: write an argumentative, critical essay.

"Some people were a little rude," she said of the anonymous Wikipedia
editors. Ultimately, she had to teach the students the difference
between good secondary research and the average college paper.

"You don't get to say that last little bit on, 'This is why this is
the truth and the way,'" she said.

Two poems--and--oh yes--a picture! (I'm in the midst of saying Yushya!
Yushya! while carrying a portable shrine for the general good luck of

Back in the day, one used to read Richard Lanham--not sure if that's still the case.

If this is you (you) or, perchance, you know him, them, might you pass
along,
preferably back channel, an e-mail -- or some form of unintrusive
contact.

Sometimes I wonder, feel disillusioned because am trying to figure out
what it means to be a poet, to whom am I 'speaking,' that what, going
back to baseball, and you'd know something about this, you, but that
what that makes a poet, his/her contribution worthy remembering (and for
some reason am fixated on Earle Combs and Harry Hooper, even Lefty
Gomez, the Ted Williams-type there, but then they'd spit on the crowd).
I am trying to transcend these ordinary notions of relevance. Speaking
with others, some of you included, am left, still, thinking about Simic,
about Creeley, about all those meanings inscribed. Whew! I remember
chatting with Harry Nudel, remember him, a bit scraggly and bitter,
self-serving, but strangely enough, he said of RC, to paraphrase, that
he would be the one on knees talking up to the cleaning lady for hours,
and how those conversations made their way into process-oriented poems -
this 'grace' of which I spoke (and grace was something I learnt living
in a monastery, chatting with some of the most thoughtful individuals
ever met, back then along the Austrian border, walking along hilltops to
encounter a hundred-year-old grave with a bunch of fresh cut flowers,
and in the wintertime, many of these monks having spent half-century
imprisoned). I remember, too, chatting with some wonderfully talented
folk in Kolkata, and we know how vital Kolkata is, don't we, all of us
so entrenched in what is happening Stateside, who still believe
something about duty to culture-at-large.

Anyway, I am still here.

i'm always writing in a rush. i never addressed my "deep image vs. LANGUAGE" post. Merwin, James Wright:  these  2  poets  have had the  most significant  influence over my way  of  looking  at  poetry.  But deep image poetry strikes me as a largely intuitive enterprise, a way of looking at the major poets who came into prominence during the sixties. I'm curious: HAS MERWIN  been an influence in the LANGUAGE school? & what about my favorite iconoclast, A R AMMONS, a singular voice who, as far as I know, has never been lumped into any particular kind of poetics. Has he influenced Language poets?

I recently had a non-poet friend direct me to the Wikipedia entry for
Li-Young Lee. I wasn't shocked because I know there are doofi (plural of
doofus) out there.

I rest my case about Wikipedia and not only discourage my students, I

Wikipedia Becomes a Class Assignment

(AP) -- Some academics cringe when students turn to Wikipedia as a
reference for term papers.

Instead of asking students in her environmental history course to
turn in one big paper at the end of the semester, she requires them
either to write an original Wikipedia article or to do a major edit
on an existing one.

The inspiration came to her as she prepared teaching materials for
her class.

"I would find these things on Wikipedia," she said, and would think,
"Gosh, this is awfully thin here. I wonder if my students could fill
this in?"

Wikipedia has been vilified as a petri dish for misinformation, and
the variable accuracy of its articles is a point Groom readily
concedes. Since the advent of the Web, she said, the quality of
sources students cite has deteriorated.

For her students, the Wikipedia experiment was "transformative," and
students' writing online proved better than the average undergrad
research paper.

Knowing their work was headed for the Web, not just one harried
professor's eyes, helped students reach higher - as did the standards
set by the volunteer "Wikipedians" who police entries for accuracy
and neutral tone, Groom said.

The exercise also gave students a taste of working in the real world
of peer-reviewed research.

Most of the articles were well received, but Groom said some students
caught heat from Wikipedia editors for doing exactly what college
students are trained to do: write an argumentative, critical essay.

"Some people were a little rude," she said of the anonymous Wikipedia
editors. Ultimately, she had to teach the students the difference
between good secondary research and the average college paper.

"You don't get to say that last little bit on, 'This is why this is
the truth and the way,'" she said.

The coverage of poetry is pretty dire. The coverage of physics is amazing
-- really well done, gone through with a fine toothed comb, and strictly
policed for cranks.

I think on balance "we poets critics &c." should steer clear of wikipedia.
The current network of blogging, websites, etc. is wonderfully
decentralized and captures the sort of dynamism that is going on. People
who want to learn about a new writer will get a great deal from jumping
into someone's blog and following the linktrail.

The problem with wikipedia is that it has such "google juice". Once an
article gets created on a subject, no matter how poor, it jumps to the top
of the google results. In a sense, the crappy article becomes the
"gateway" for the curious, and I don't think we want that.

Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning might be one good place to start in the
works of Roman Jakobson, but I would think his work would be key to take
into account in any study since, of rhetoric. And Kenneth Burke, A
Rhetoric of Motives, and other works, would be key, as well.

I've assigned "wiki-subversion" assignments to students: alter the
text of a Wiki page and print it up.

What's the point of this?

After students see how easy it is to create a false or misleading
entry, they reconsider (or pause, at least) when taking information
from the Internet.

Not knowing much about Li-Young Lee (I heard him read once, tried to read
his work a couple of times, but it was not a kind of poetry in which I was
interested, at least at that time), but wanting to learn, I'd be
interested in your report of just what is wrong about the Wikipedia entry
for him.

I have found entries on poets I like a lot to be, well, not deep, but not
inaccurate. See entries on Hugo Ball, Susan Howe, Harryette Mullen,
Jackson Mac Low, and Alice Notley, among others.

Still, I agree that these are not places I would advise students to go
when researching a topic. Particularly they are not places I would advise
students to stop, i.e. the information found on Wikipedia is usually just
the surface, even when it's not incorrect.

I was in attendance at and honored to be the Judson Jerome Scholar at this
past summer's Antioch Writers' Workshop.  The announcement had just been
made about the college closing.  There were several announcements during the
workshop regarding the closing.  This is from the website:

Response to the Announcement of Antioch College's Closing

The Antioch Writers' Workshop is deeply saddened by the announcement of the
closing of Antioch College in July of 2008.

The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to present its annual summer
writing conference in Yellow Springs, Ohio, this year and for many years to
come. Although the workshop originated at Antioch College in 1986, in 1993 a
501(C)(3) nonprofit entity was created, the Yellow Springs Writers'
Workshop, and we have operated as an independent organization, separate from
Antioch College, for the past 14 years.

The Antioch Writers' Workshop recognizes Antioch College's tradition of
literary excellence, with such notable writing alumni as Lawrence Block,
Ralph Keyes, Sylvia Nasar, Louis Sachar, Dava Sobel, Mark Strand, and Rod
Serling. It is our fervent hope that Antioch College will be able to restore
itself and reopen in the future.

The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to partner with Antioch
University McGregor to provide continuing education credit opportunities for
our participants

Apparently, the interjected notes about Li-Young have been removed.  But
they were there two days ago...and it was pretty disgusting to see what
someone could so easily add to an entry.

Sorry.  I should have checked before sending out my former note.

I still stand by my prohibition of Wikipedia for my students' research.  I
do understand how it might be helpful to have students correct or add
information.

I avoid Wikipedia problems in classes by telling students that they're
welcome to use Wikipedia to find links to original articles/sources,
but that the Wiki text itself is off-limits.

Alternatively, one could workk to make the entires on poetry better. More free work, just what we need! But seriously, I love Wikipedia and I use it all the time and find it very helpful. Example: Not long ago, I was writing a piece on a painter who'd painted some paintings of the Merritt Parkway. Well, you would not believe the amount of info on the Merritt Parkway that's on Wikipedia. Not that I needed to cite any of it--just that I could feel confident that nothing I was going to say in passing about the Merritt Parkway would actually be wrong. Fantastic. Why there isn't as much information on a poet as on a highway is what I'd like to know. I've donated money to Wikipedia but if I had more time, I'd donate that too.

I have found entries on poets I like a lot to be, well, not deep, but not
inaccurate. See entries on Hugo Ball, Susan Howe, Harryette Mullen,
Jackson Mac Low, and Alice Notley, among others.

Still, I agree that these are not places I would advise students to go
when researching a topic. Particularly they are not places I would advise
students to stop, i.e. the information found on Wikipedia is usually just
the surface, even when it's not incorrect.

Personally, I find Wikipedia very useful. And I expect this is true for
millions of people.

Students have to know how to use it. Because they certainly are going to use
it. Don't put your head in the sand and pretend otherwise.

They have to learn how verify information on the Internet. And to be very
careful about using information they haven't verified.

We all have fallen for false information at one time or another on the
Internet.

Whenever I've been involved in a story that ended up in a newspaper, I've
been amazed at how inaccurate the details were in the newspaper. Of course
it isn't just the newspapers or the Internet where false information occurs
frequently.

The kids need to learn to be critical, to become media literate. You don't
get that way by being instructed to simply avoid things like Wikipedia. Deal
with it. I like the assignment to introduce falsities into Wikipedia. Good
one. As long as they don't get tagged by the Wikipedians as bandits.

Concerning Simon's point about not liking Wikipedia concerning its
'coverage' of poets and poetry and preferring, instead, blogs and sites and
such, I agree that Wikipedia is no substitute for all other sources of
information.

Centrality that connects to the periphery is also useful. Connect the
central to the peripheral. How's that for an assignment?

I'll chime in and say what I said to my students on the wikipedia
subject. Nature did a fairly exhaustive comparison of Wikipedia and
Encyclopedia Britannica (sorry, can't afford the nature subscription
to link to that study, but an intrepid person could probably dig it
up). The result was that the two were dead even, which says one thing
pretty clearly- encyclopedias are what they are, curiosity saters and
occasional beacons to better sources, but not research material.
Personally, I commend wikipedia for how good it is on current events,
its "news worthy" entries on recent events are occasionally better
than AP.

I've found decent stuff on poets like Robert Duncan or H.D., scant
little on some more recent (curious to go check out the entry on
Susan Howe though). Even more offensive to me were entries on jazz
musicians, particularly drummers- there was a large scrolling page
for Louis Bellson and barely a paragraph for Kenny Clarke, the latter
being, with no disrespect to Louis, appreciably more important to the
history of the music and his instrument. The expression of race bias
was fairly obvious to me. Might go back and check if the phenomenon
repeats itself in literature (how does Langston Hughes' page compare
to Carl Sandburg's?)

I couldn't agree more. My Mom is a Library Media Specialist who teaches K-12, and one of the things she's always doing when teaching kids research skills is explaining to them the importance of using the internet properly. Wikipedia is a good example of that. She actually did one lesson last year where she and I conspired to a couple of changes to the wikipedia article about her school district right before the class she was teaching looked at it. the information was wildly incorrect and the object of the lesson was to try to figure out how to find out the correct information. lots of fun was had all around.

Good ideas for debunking Internet junk, guys.  I'm sure if you're teaching graduate students, they understand the need for further research (or I would hope so, at least), and could effectively use a web tool such as Wikipedia.  Many undergrads (particularly in freshman comp) are only looking for a source to lift a couple of quotes from, then include on their Bibliography or Works Cited page, regardless of the validity.

Case in point:  the "Male Pregnancy" webpage (http://www.malepregnancy.com/).  Looks pretty real, has testimonials, and a real-time "monitor" that shows the father's heart beat (or the "baby's").  Unfortunately, Mr. Lei has been pregnant for at least three semesters now (and I don't mean trimesters!).  It's a good website to help show students how any website can be set up to look legit.

Thanks for the input.

I encourage that kind of use as well--as a "first stop" for basic facts and
for finding links to other sources.  I also tell my students that anything
they find on Wikipedia is only a beginning and all facts need to be checked
against other sources.  And for that matter, I use that to discuss the way
in which *all* sources should really be questioned, interrogated, and
double-checked, from the most basic kind of "facts" to scholarly theories
and assertions.

Wikipedia actually has much more to offer than as a "reference" the way most
undergraduates use it.  I'm doing my dissertation on spoken word and I have
used Wikipedia to look at how people with a vested interest in the various
terms around spoken word, performance poetry and poetry slam have used
Wikipedia as a forum to define and debate what the various definitions
mean--and how they have attempted to use Wikipedia to reify those terms as
well.

All in all, Wikipedia can be used very productively in fact, not so much as
a credible source in itself, but as a great way to engage students in
conversations about the nature and process of knowledge production.

I avoid Wikipedia problems in classes by telling students that they're
welcome to use Wikipedia to find links to original articles/sources,
but that the Wiki text itself is off-limits.

ou know, I think it would be great to look at such pavlova as a model for

 Yes, it was meant for Catherine and her collection.
 But mostly it is my peace offering to the Middle East and the whole world
 looking about to be blown up. See, I figure, if
 ANYONEANYWHEREANYTIMEFOREVERMORE sits and eats this pavlova:
 THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE EATING THIS PAVLOVA IS GONNA THINK A BIT ABOUT
 WAR OR WHO SIDE THEY'RE ON AND AFTERWARDS HERE'S THE BEST PART: you need
 a nap--you've absolutely gotta sleep after eating this...
 Nowaynohow to blow up self and others in past-pavlova euphoria.
 So this is MY OFFERING FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
 (i do pray it works...please "focus on pavlova"--world of ours pathetic

Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning might be one good place to start in the

I've assigned "wiki-subversion" assignments to students: alter the

What's the point of this?
After students see how easy it is to create a false or misleading
ntry, they reconsider (or pause, at least) when taking information
rom the Internet.

Not knowing much about Li-Young Lee (I heard him read once, tried to read
is work a couple of times, but it was not a kind of poetry in which I was
nterested, at least at that time), but wanting to learn, I'd be
nterested in your report of just what is wrong about the Wikipedia entry
or him.
I have found entries on poets I like a lot to be, well, not deep, but not
naccurate. See entries on Hugo Ball, Susan Howe, Harryette Mullen,
ackson Mac Low, and Alice Notley, among others.
Still, I agree that these are not places I would advise students to go
hen researching a topic. Particularly they are not places I would advise
tudents to stop, i.e. the information found on Wikipedia is usually just
he surface, even when it's not incorrect.

I was in attendance at and honored to be the Judson Jerome Scholar at this
ast summer's Antioch Writers' Workshop.  The announcement had just been
ade about the college closing.  There were several announcements during the
orkshop regarding the closing.  This is from the website:
Response to the Announcement of Antioch College's Closing
The Antioch Writers' Workshop is deeply saddened by the announcement of the
losing of Antioch College in July of 2008.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to present its annual summer
riting conference in Yellow Springs, Ohio, this year and for many years to
ome. Although the workshop originated at Antioch College in 1986, in 1993 a
01(C)(3) nonprofit entity was created, the Yellow Springs Writers'
orkshop, and we have operated as an independent organization, separate from
ntioch College, for the past 14 years.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop recognizes Antioch College's tradition of
iterary excellence, with such notable writing alumni as Lawrence Block,
alph Keyes, Sylvia Nasar, Louis Sachar, Dava Sobel, Mark Strand, and Rod
erling. It is our fervent hope that Antioch College will be able to restore
tself and reopen in the future.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to partner with Antioch
niversity McGregor to provide continuing education credit opportunities for
ur participants

I have found entries on poets I like a lot to be, well, not deep, but not

ackson Mac Low, and Alice Notley, among others.
Still, I agree that these are not places I would advise students to go

tudents to stop, i.e. the information found on Wikipedia is usually just

Personally, I find Wikipedia very useful. And I expect this is true for
illions of people.
Students have to know how to use it. Because they certainly are going to use
t. Don't put your head in the sand and pretend otherwise.
They have to learn how verify information on the Internet. And to be very
areful about using information they haven't verified.
We all have fallen for false information at one time or another on the
nternet.
Whenever I've been involved in a story that ended up in a newspaper, I've
een amazed at how inaccurate the details were in the newspaper. Of course
t isn't just the newspapers or the Internet where false information occurs
requently.
The kids need to learn to be critical, to become media literate. You don't
et that way by being instructed to simply avoid things like Wikipedia. Deal
ith it. I like the assignment to introduce falsities into Wikipedia. Good

 (AP) -- Some academics cringe when students turn to Wikipedia as a

 concedes. Since the advent of the Web, she said, the quality of

 For her students, the Wikipedia experiment was "transformative," and

Not knowing much about Li-Young Lee (I heard him read once, tried to read
is work a couple of times, but it was not a kind of poetry in which I was
nterested, at least at that time), but wanting to learn, I'd be
nterested in your report of just what is wrong about the Wikipedia entry
or him.
I have found entries on poets I like a lot to be, well, not deep, but not
naccurate. See entries on Hugo Ball, Susan Howe, Harryette Mullen,
ackson Mac Low, and Alice Notley, among others.
Still, I agree that these are not places I would advise students to go
hen researching a topic. Particularly they are not places I would advise
tudents to stop, i.e. the information found on Wikipedia is usually just
he surface, even when it's not incorrect.

 (AP) -- Some academics cringe when students turn to Wikipedia as a
 reference for term papers.

 Instead of asking students in her environmental history course to
 turn in one big paper at the end of the semester, she requires them
 either to write an original Wikipedia article or to do a major edit
 on an existing one.

 The inspiration came to her as she prepared teaching materials for
 her class.

 Knowing their work was headed for the Web, not just one harried
 professor's eyes, helped students reach higher - as did the standards
 set by the volunteer "Wikipedians" who police entries for accuracy
 and neutral tone, Groom said.

 The exercise also gave students a taste of working in the real world

I was in attendance at and honored to be the Judson Jerome Scholar at this
ast summer's Antioch Writers' Workshop.  The announcement had just been
ade about the college closing.  There were several announcements during the
orkshop regarding the closing.  This is from the website:
Response to the Announcement of Antioch College's Closing
The Antioch Writers' Workshop is deeply saddened by the announcement of the
losing of Antioch College in July of 2008.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to present its annual summer
riting conference in Yellow Springs, Ohio, this year and for many years to
ome. Although the workshop originated at Antioch College in 1986, in 1993 a
01(C)(3) nonprofit entity was created, the Yellow Springs Writers'
orkshop, and we have operated as an independent organization, separate from
ntioch College, for the past 14 years.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop recognizes Antioch College's tradition of
iterary excellence, with such notable writing alumni as Lawrence Block,
alph Keyes, Sylvia Nasar, Louis Sachar, Dava Sobel, Mark Strand, and Rod
erling. It is our fervent hope that Antioch College will be able to restore
tself and reopen in the future.=20
The Antioch Writers' Workshop will continue to partner with Antioch
niversity McGregor to provide continuing education credit opportunities for
ur participants

So Louis Bellson has one big fan who takes the trouble to contribute to Wikipedia and Klook hasn't found his yet so you attribute it to racism. If you have some knowledge of the subject, why don't you take the time to expand the entry? Or at least contribute to the discussion behind the Clarke article?

up). The result was that the two were dead even, which says one thing
pretty clearly- encyclopedias are what they are, curiosity saters and
occasional beacons to better sources, but not research material.
Personally, I commend wikipedia for how good it is on current events,
its "news worthy" entries on recent events are occasionally better
than AP.

I've found decent stuff on poets like Robert Duncan or H.D., scant
little on some more recent (curious to go check out the entry on
Susan Howe though). Even more offensive to me were entries on jazz
musicians, particularly drummers- there was a large scrolling page
for Louis Bellson and barely a paragraph for Kenny Clarke, the latter
being, with no disrespect to Louis, appreciably more important to the
history of the music and his instrument. The expression of race bias
was fairly obvious to me. Might go back and check if the phenomenon
repeats itself in literature (how does Langston Hughes' page compare
to Carl Sandburg's?)

Subject:      IS THERE REALLY LEAD IN THAT!? until you can prove it LEAVE CHINA
              ALONE!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi, I'm 41 years old.  Ever since I was able to read as a little kid I
remember reading the label MADE IN CHINA on the bottom of, on the back of,
nearly everything in my filthy little home.  As far as I knew everything was
made in China, except coffins, which I knew my family made in the factory.
But seriously, every toy, shoe, telephone, spatula, necklace, as far as I
knew even the sky, even babies, all came from China and were brought over in
big magical boats for our homes.

It's just really ODD to me that all of a sudden every single fucking week on
the news there's yet another story about lead in the paint of a TOY, or
poison in the dog food.  It's SO ODD!  I mean, was it always there and we're
just now figuring it out?  Or did someone lose their mind in China and
suddenly think it's good to use lead and other poisons?

No, I'm not convinced.  In fact you might think I'm paranoid, but I just
don't believe it's happening.  I don't.  WHY after all of these years would
manufacturers in China start using something to ship to America KNOWING that
it's illegal to have on our store shelves?  Like I said, you might think I'm
paranoid, but I don't believe it.

What do I believe instead?  Well, so far (and I've been looking) all the
stories I've seen and heard about this don't interview anyone in China from
the factories.  The stories are all American.  And American businesses are
so competitive that I don't put it past them to prey on American consumer
minds to use racism, and to use CHILDREN and PUPPIES, the two most beloved
living American beings, to do it.  Am I paranoid?  But aren't we living in a
country right now whose corporations sent us to war in Iraq?

According to Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW, all of the major television news
corporations, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, are each part of separate conglomerate
entities which each also own companies which design and manufacture
weapons.  And she told us in Philadelphia when giving a talk at the
University of Pennsylvania Law School that her friends from all of these
major news stations have told her that they were receiving phone calls
directly into the control rooms on the first few days after the invasion of
Iraq, making sure that they got a close up of a certain kind of machine gun,
or tank, or some other weapon.  In researching this odd need to focus on
particular ITEMS on their news coverage at the start of the war, Goodman
discovered that THESE ITEMS in each case were ITEMS made by weapons
manufacturers owned by the same conglomerates who owned each of the news
stations.  OUR NEWS STATIONS MANUFACTURE WEAPONS OH MY GOD!  Conflict of
interest for the coverage of the conflict in Iraq?  Yeah, just a tad.

Am I paranoid?  Well, AREN'T YOU FOR FUCK SAKE!?  Anyway, until someone can
show me PROOF that people in China are REALLY TRYING TO KILL America's
children and puppies, I'm not believing it!  We're being set up, it's a
hunch, just a hunch, but maybe I'm right!  But as far as I'm aware American
businesses will do ANYTHING and it really does seem true they will do
ANYTHING to make a buck!  Including kill close to a million people in Iraq
to do so.  Destroy families.  Bomb homes.  Should the babies of the world
fear America?  How many dogs were killed by American bombs and gunfire in
Baghdad in recent years?  Lead in the paint and poison in the puppy chow is
NOTHING compared to that!  We have a lot of fucking nerve some days!

But maybe I'm wrong.  But at the moment I'm thinking I'm right!  But if
someone knows of a source of news to clear it up for me, trust me, I'm more
than willing to see and hear it.

ANOTHER SUSPICIOUS MORNING!

I agree with people who view wikipedia as a useful tool. I suppose
(shorter Simon) that the counterpoint is "don't do wikipedia any favors."

I forget the exact rank, but wikipedia is somewhere in the top ten of all
websites in terms of visits and "eyeball share." This is absolutely
amazing. The founders (Jimbo Wales is the one remaining) I think have
absolutely no idea how this happened.

They are sitting on something that is worth more than facebook. Literally,
billions of dollars are somewhere in there, and the people paying for the
server space are trying to figure out where it's hiding. (While they are
also asking for donations.)

Right now they are trying to "monetize" it by spinning off for-profit
wikipedia-like sites (I believe "WikiCities" was one.) You haven't heard
of WikiCities because it flopped. They haven't found the cash.

Wikipedia itself is run by a non-profit "foundation". Formally, the people
who are trying to make money off the wikipedia concept are legally
separate from the foundation people. But to say there is overlap and
conflict-of-interest is to put it mildly. Everyone stands to become rich
beyond their wildest dreams.

I've seen more than once (check rhubarb for "flagged revisions") this
impulse affect what happens on wikipedia. Wikipedia is, in the end, a bit
of a mess -- legally, pr-wise, etc. -- and the goal right now seems to be
figuring out how to make it cash-friendly.

I think, in other words, that people should be wary of investing their
time in wikipedia's poetry coverage. I think it is much wiser to build
your own sites and information networks rather than labor for free on a
project that nobody in the community will control or profit from.

A close, human rights activist and writer friend of mine is in Kabul with the job of
interviewing folks who were released from Qauntanamo. A relative
novice at this kind of work, before he left, he was told
that Kabul, in contrast to other parts of the country,
would be safe. I know this account does not fit the
contours of most of our current or absence of discussions
of poetry, but I think it is an account that lives at the
periphery of the collective Euro-American consciousness, the
stuff that can now be attributed to "our name."

 I'm still in Kabul -- paranoia land. Dinner last night with an
 American lawyer working for the State Department. She's living inside the
 wire, in a drug dealer baroque palace rented from a warlord by the us Govt,
 with thirty foot blast walls around it. One block to the restaurant
 but she had to go with the full MST, mobile support team. One armored SUV
 with a driver plus chase car with driver and gunman. She says it's
 better than when she had the PSD -- personal secuirity detail. That's a
 guy from Dyncorp who goes in the restauraunt with loaded gun and sweeps
 it before she can go in. She had the PSD in Herat, where she was blown
 up by the police chief because the US Govt police training program
 insisted on paying the police directly, thus taking the money for the
 innumerable ghost policement away from the police chief. So he rocketed them
 and killed her Nepali driver. (Not a real Ghurka, she says.) Anyway,
 the MST won't let us ride with her the one block to the restaurant so we
 have to walk, past extremely paranoid trigger-happy security guards,
 but at least it's only one block. We get there. It's Lebanese, USgovt
 approved, there's a very short list, and since they can't go anywhere
 without the MST they can't really mingle with the population. They're all
 going mad with boredom inside the wire. This is true for all US govt
 personnel, consequently theyhave no contact with the population at all.

 At the restaurant, she tells us about (a) the incident at the Internet
 Cafe at which her friend was blown up, and (b) how the prison support
 project was ambushed on the road to the prison (edge of the city) and
 two more people killed. This all in the last year. They all ride around
 in up -armored SUVs with chase cars which makes them very easy to spot.
 Reportedly they are moving to low profile Toyota saloons like
 everybody else, very smart. Meanwhile the real targets are the US supported
 National Army and the international force (ISAF) patrols. When the
 national army comes through they aim their rifles at the nearby cars, just in
 case they are suicide bombers. Everybody gets extremely paranoid. SInce
 this is all happening in the m iddle of the permanent Kabul traffic
 jam it kind of takes place in slow motion. Very creepy. No wonder
 everybody in this town is kind of brusque and they don't like foreigners much.
 The ISAF patrols are even worse, they stand out like sore thumbs in
 their APCs. They have six month tours, don't speak the language, never
 meet the locals, and don't know where they are. This is madness.

505 butter
1 tablespoon plain flour
1 egg yolk
3 tablespoons cream
2 teaspoons lemon juice
Freshly ground black peper
I sipped on my whisky sour, ground out my cigarette on the chopping board and watched a bug trying to crawlout of the basin. I needd a tqable at Maxim's, a hundred bucks and a gorgeous blonde; what I had was a leg of lamb and no clues... (in goes on in Mark Crick's fun little book.).

At the top of the page you will see four tabs: article, discussion, edit this page, and history. Look around in there and you'll see what's what.
  However, it's considered very, very bad form to try and edit a page that concerns you.

That's a fair point. I did think about adding to the entry on Clarke,
but realized that the only thing I could do was go into my library
and reprint information from other people's research, which is
certainly what most of the entries on wikipedia consist of, hopefully
with proper credit. That didn't excite me much, and didn't seem all
that valuable to the public. I think if I had some original research
on Clarke or someone else, then I would feel obliged to put that up.
But, in the spirit of someone who still believes in the site, I will
take up your challenge and go beef up the entry, instead of
complaining. Check back if you're interes

As far as the racism charge (I think I said "race bias"), I don't
mean racism as the attitude of any individual or group, especially
given the editorial configuration of wikipedia. It just seems obvious
to me that the weighting of information on wikipedia reflects the
makeup of its contributors. One other thing Nature found out is that
wikipedia is actually better than Encyclopedia Brittanica on science
and technology, worse on humanities. I'm inclined to infer that there
are, then, more science and tech savvy contributors than lit-savvy
ones. Perhaps it is inaccurate to also make the inference that, among
those writing entries on American jazz musicians, more of them are
white than black. The only criticism I'd make beyond that is, if I
sat down and wrote a very long entry on Louis Bellson that repeated
the claim "the greatest drummer in the world", I'd feel a little
guilty about not going and giving credit to the guys whose shoulders
Bellson sat on (and certainly that includes Klook, Papa Jo Jones and
also Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich).

SELF-IMMOLATION: A voluntary sacrifice or denial of
oneself, as for an ideal or another person.

Most famously demonstrated by Buddhist monk Thich
Quang Duc on June 11, 1963 in Vietnam.

Most recently demonstrated by musician Malachi
Ritscher in Chicago on November 3, 2006 as a protest
against the Iraq war.  One year ago, Malachi set
himself on fire next to the Kennedy Expressway during
morning rush hour.  He left a statement and obituary
on his website.
http://www.savagesound.com/gallery99.htm

As the Iraq War moves towards year 5,  I am taking
some time to think about Malachi.  I am wondering how
we find new ways to express our sadness, rage, and
disgust.  When does the turning point come?  When is
it enough?

Onwards,

My friend Joe Keppler has a show up of steel sculpture in Seattle, so I'm
going south to see the show. He's a terrific poet, sculptor, sound artist,
photographer, and performer. His steel sculptures are very interesting and
often provocatively literary. Not concrete but steel. Meeting Joe back in
the 80's was a turning point in my life; Joe and some other artists in
Seattle I met back then have a strong intermedial, polyartistic side to
their literary work that makes Seattle a special place of literary
synthesis.

On Saturday Nov 10 I'll be doing a reading, as will Carletta Wilson, at
Joe's show of steel sculpture. I hope you can make it.

A perfect day in Maine


On the beach I walk and think, I hate these avatars of mine, they don't do
anything worthwhile at this point. It's too easy to make interesting
images and my brain is emptied out. Buddhist aggregates would fill it, but
then there's the problem they might end up annihilated, who wants empti-
ness when the replete amazes. I learn that if sound and sight are discon-
nected from production, why should I bother with meaning? Who wants to
just listen and watch, when everyone has heard and seen everything?

Why are there many rather than one? The ultimate koan - surely the number
is random, surely there would be meaningless degree? Or not? Mind won't
say. I can't even say rock, snail, woman, water.

The most difficult lesson: Some things have no causes at all.

I think it sounds nice but isn't very meaningful, which is probably
necessary in seeking for a general definition that distinguishes poetry from
prose.  However, even by that standard, the role of the audience is simply
too passive here.

Thank you for that, Pierre.

And just how does a term like =B3Deep Image=B2 come to be re-used in such an
unlikely context? And why?

Surely Ammons, et al., could have found some snappy new phrase of their ver=
y
own? Or, one wonders, was it an attempt to bury, to rewrite the story?

Ammons, Merwin & co. have to my my knowledge not influenced the L-=3D20

Robert Kelly (before the name got hijacked by Bly, Merwin etc) have =3D20

Rothenberg & Kelly used it briefly =96 a few essays in Trobar, plus a =20=

letter exchange with Creeley and some other material. But neither of =20
them were into founding a school or movement as such. Back then, Bly =20

Bly ran with the concept. I have  a graduate student working on a diss =20=

around Deep Image right now, & I hope he will come up with a =20

around DI =96 which I believe was an important moment in post-War US =20

ARCHAIC DESIGN  (Black Widow Press), Clayton, in a foornote to his =20

quotes Olson's response to his "Notes on the Poetry of Deep Image" : =20
"not imageS but image." Which shows I believe a very accurate =20

I don't believe Ammons used that term or that it is normally applied to his work. Robert Bly, Galway Kinnell, W.S. Merwin, and James Wright are names I see associated with the term. I would think that Ammons' use of technical vocabularies would be the most important of a number of reasons why Ammons' work might be anathema to Bly and his colleagues.

I posted about "deep image." Merwin & J Wright have been lumped in that school. I spoke of Ammons as an iconoclast, belonging to no school. I mentioned in one of my post my fondness for "Tape for the Turning of the Year" by Ammons, a poem that seems to me to anticipate the Language poetics. I may be wrong about "the story." I'm usually thinking out loud when I post. I'm anything, but not infallible.

Not only am i not infallible, I just scrolled down to Pierre Joris. He answers my question. I wasn't aware of the Bly/Merwin hijacking. Bly, I find, tedious. The New Age guru bullshit gets on my nerves.

This discussion has been quite interesting, & says a lot about the
attitudes people hold about wikipedia.  One thing that hasn't been
pointed out is that among young people (or at least those in my
world) wikipedia is used automatically as a portal into any inquiry.
Being children of the internet age I'm pretty sure most of them
realize  it is one possible source of information & not gospel.  & as
has been mentioned previous wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on
the net & gets tremendous amounts of traffic.  A couple references to
my projects generate hundreds of hits a month onto my own websites.

Wikipedia introduced Veropedia last month, which is the next logical
step in user-contributed content.  For those that use wikipedia for

I am jumping in after your response, Diane. I remember how much James Wright influenced me while I was in college. I thought his style was considered "common language"--(sounds almost like plain english in legal forms.) He seemed to be the epitome of the 1970's poet, especially in my part of the country--the midwest. I was just thinking about his poem, "Autumn Beings in Martin's Ferry, Ohio."  The poem does not have the impact that it once had on me, but I still find it poignant--and deep, if I understand the way you are using that term (which I may not be understanding at all).

And just how does a term like ³Deep Image² come to be re-used in such an
unlikely context? And why?

Surely Ammons, et al., could have found some snappy new phrase of their very
own? Or, one wonders, was it an attempt to bury, to rewrite the story?

I think the distinction is primarily a tactical one as relates to
composition, that poetry is built from the basic unit of the sentence
whereas prose it built from the basic unit of the paragraph.

some new images from dbCinema:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/sunset
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/saint

the first series is made of pictures dbcinema downloaded via a query of
'beautiful sunset'.

the second series is made of pictures dbcinema downloaded via a query of
'silvia saint'.

the series i've done so far are collected at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm . all these images are screenshots
from movies that dbCinema generated. they're screenshots of movies taken
while the movies play. dbCinema itself (the software) is not online yet.

the basic idea of dbCinema is to create a new form of cinema. interactive,
net-dependent, painterly cinema that combines the computer's well-known
poetential concerning visual abstraction with the representational
possibilities posed by being able to type in anything and get relevant
images back (via google and yahoo image search). dbCinema is a work of
generative software art. it is cinema for those who like interactive work,
visual art, and being able to shape cinema like a potter shapes clay on the
gyre.

the new series (sunset and saint) are quite abstract, but dbCinema 'brushes'
can be configured to reveal as much of the downloaded images as you like (as
in the less abstract leftwich, huth, and kandinsky series at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm ).

Information about Rothenberg & Kelly's conception of Deep Image can be
found in Daniel Kane's "All Poet's Welcome" which includes an interchange
between Joris and Kane on this list. In his response Pierre mentions these
same essays of Kelly's and the correspondence with Creeley. As well, he
mentions  his search for a graduate student to write a dissertation on the
subject, a search which came to an end a number of years ago.

Kelly's essay "Notes on the Poetry of Deep Image" can be found here:

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9707&L=POETICS&P=R28032&D=1&I=-3

and the original Kane/Joris interaction on the poetics list can be found

Subject:      Ahadada Books Presents:  The Late Poems of Lu You; The Old Man
              Who Does As He Pleases Translated by Burton Watson
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear All,

Anyone familiar with classical Chinese and Japanese literature in
translation knows Burton Watson.  Happily, Burton is my neighbor and my
friend, and he agreed to allow Ahadada Books to "scoop" Columbia
University Press (Burton's usual publisher) by publishing Late Poems of
Lu You; The Old Man Who Does As He Pleases in a very attractive
bilingual addition, which also includes excerpts from Lu You's travel
diary.

Lu You (1125--1210) was among the most prolific of Song Dynasty poets.
His poems are notable for communicating a carefree enjoyment of life.
Burton Watson's limpid versions capture the spirit of the originals,
and are a joy to read as poems in themselves.

Small Press Distribution has a number of copies on hand for sale (a large
box of them are on the way to Berkeley from Japan even as I write), and
the book has already garnered a great review from Donald Richie in the
Japan Times.  (You may read it on their website.)

We also have a limited number of signed copies for sale.  For these
please back-channel me.

This book would make a great addition to anyone's library.

Thanks for reading!

Jess (The original Ahadada)

A cursory glance of most poetry anthologies, as well as the various histori=
es of Modern American poetry that have been published since the 1960=92s po=
sit Bly as being the deep image =93school=92s=94 leading poet and theorist.=
  With the exception of some initial interactions between Bly and Rothenber=
g, there is little in Bly=92s work to suggest that he fully grasped the cor=
e group=92s attempt at conceptualizing deep image poetics.  The deep image =
poetics associated with Bly, in fact, can either be considered a misreading=
 of Rothenberg and Kelly=92s statements, or indeed a serious divergence dow=
n another path. For Bly, a kind of solitude is necessary in deep image poet=
ics.  Although Kelly and Rothenberg allude to energy and movement in relati=
on to the poetic image in their conception of the deep image, Bly omits the=
 participatory aspect of the image.  Bly, the hero-poet, descends to the de=
pths of the unconscious and performs an act of recovery and articulation fo=
r the reader, as opposed to the demand for participation in the composition=
 of the poetic space that Kelly, Rothenberg, Owens, and Schwerner demand in=
 their own work.  For all of the paths Bly=92s deep image poetics attempts =
to reveal in the on-going struggle to re-connect humans to the cosmological=
 world, the main thrust of his poetics relies instead on =93plugging=94 the=
 image into a pre-existing mythological system based much more firmly on Ju=
ng=92s theory of the archetype and the collective unconscious (see Bly=92s =
_Iron John_).  In fact, the casual way in which some dismiss the deep image=
 as a pedestrian deployment of Jungian archetypal psychology and the latent=
 structuralism of anthropologists like Levi-Strauss, can be directly attrib=
uted to Bly=92s misreading.
           =20
Bly and Wright (Bly=92s =93co-conspirator=94) neglect the community-based o=
rigins of deep image poetics.  Publications like Kelly and Economou=92s Tro=
bar and the various poetry readings that the core group held imply that at =
the foundation of deep image poetics is the concept that each of these spac=
es constitutes a site of resistance to the absorption of Modern American po=
etry into the academy.  Similarly, each of these spaces opens up an arena f=
or on-going conversations among poets and text, broadly defined.  By placin=
g translations of pre-modern, esoteric, troubadour, as well as Surrealist p=
oetry and the work of figures like Lorca alongside essays and poems which a=
lso consider the function of the rejected knowledge that fuels the mythopoe=
tic revolution (Gnostic texts, alchemical treatises, ritual chant and song)=
 and the inherent politics of re-opening a dialogue with the =93Other,=94 t=
he performance spaces of the deep image group hinge upon participation and =
conversation to further the opening of the poetic field, towards Duncan=92s=
 =93symposium of the whole.=94  However, Bly and Wright initiate a deep ima=
ge poetics that joins the rank of Bernstein=92s =93official verse culture.=
=94  Bly and Wright use their misreading of deep image poetry to carve out =
a niche in the official (read: Norton) American poetry institution and to d=
evelop careers as =93officially accredited=94 poets, thus re-affirming the =
more egocentric =93hero-poet=94 model impertinent to Kelly, Rothenberg, and=
 Economou=92s sense of poetic community.

I have subscribed to the poetics listserv for over a month, and find myself confused...The discussions of poetry are speckled with largely unrelated, though interesting material...C'est vrai?

I find it infuriating that on this list one immediately reaches for accusations of careerism and the like in order to attribute motivations to poets who have divergent ideas. Isn't it enough to say that Bly and co. had an impoverished notion of "deep image" without having to say they developed this just because they knew that such a concept would be the key to getting into the Norton Anthology?

With the exception of some initial interactions between Bly and Rothenberg, there is little in Bly’s work to suggest that he fully grasped the core group’s attempt at conceptualizing deep image poetics. The deep image poetics associated with Bly, in fact, can either be considered a misreading of Rothenberg and Kelly’s statements, or indeed a serious divergence down another path. For Bly, a kind of solitude is necessary in deep image poetics. Although Kelly and Rothenberg allude to energy and movement in relation to the poetic image in their conception of the deep image, Bly omits the participatory aspect of the image. Bly, the hero-poet, descends to the depths of the unconscious and performs an act of recovery and articulation for the reader, as opposed to the
 demand for participation in the composition of the poetic space that Kelly, Rothenberg, Owens, and Schwerner demand in their own work. For all of the paths Bly’s deep image poetics attempts to reveal in the on-going struggle to re-connect humans to the cosmological world, the main thrust of his poetics relies instead on “plugging” the image into a pre-existing mythological system based much more firmly on Jung’s theory of the archetype and the collective unconscious (see Bly’s _Iron John_). In fact, the casual way in which some dismiss the deep image as a pedestrian deployment of Jungian archetypal psychology and the latent structuralism of anthropologists like Levi-Strauss, can be directly attributed to Bly’s misreading.

Bly and Wright (Bly’s “co-conspirator”) neglect the community-based origins of deep image poetics. Publications like Kelly and Economou’s Trobar and the various poetry readings that the core group held imply that at the foundation of deep image poetics is the concept that each of these spaces constitutes a site of resistance to the absorption of Modern American poetry into the academy. Similarly, each of these spaces opens up an arena for on-going conversations among poets and text, broadly defined. By placing translations of pre-modern, esoteric, troubadour, as well as Surrealist poetry and the work of figures like Lorca alongside essays and poems which also consider the function of the rejected knowledge that fuels the mythopoetic revolution (Gnostic texts, alchemical treatises, ritual chant and song) and the inherent politics of re-opening a dialogue with the “Other,” the performance spaces of the deep image group hinge upon participation and conversation to further the
 opening of the poetic field, towards Duncan’s “symposium of the whole.” However, Bly and Wright initiate a deep image poetics that joins the rank of Bernstein’s “official verse culture.” Bly and Wright use their misreading of deep image poetry to carve out a niche in the official (read: Norton) American poetry institution and to develop careers as “officially accredited” poets, thus re-affirming the more egocentric “hero-poet” model impertinent to Kelly, Rothenberg, and Economou’s sense of poetic community.

prose is what you write when you think you might be understood; poetry,

Wystan, playing into the hands of what?  When you say "the age" do you refer
to the state of literature or to external circumstances? If the former, I
suppose one could argue, if they were so inclined, that enough blurring of
the boundaries has happened for it to be useful to attempt to redraw them
(if only as an experiment).

For me, the primary difference between poetry and prose is not in how I
write them (certain types of prose excepted) but in how I read them.  My
reading of poetry is much slower and deliberate to the point where I've even
been known to say that I read prose and think about poetry.  Exceptions to
this are James Joyce and crappy poetry, which is to say great prose and
crappy poetry, though that says much more about my personal preferences and
biases than anything else, of course.

dear steve,

just for the record: ammons' "tape," published in 1994, could in no
way have "anticipate[d] the Language poetics," which was originally
formulated in the 1970s, became contested in wider literary circles in
the 1980s and was essentially over (in terms of group identifications
and energies) by the 1990s (though of course many in the original
moment continue to write and publish today).

to the extent that the ammons poem uses the adding machine tape as a
formal constraint, it could be more plausibly argued that language
poetics and/or oulipo anticipated the ammons poem.

allbests,
tom orange

I posted about "deep image." Merwin & J Wright have been lumped in
that school. I spoke of Ammons as an iconoclast, belonging to no
school. I mentioned in one of my post my fondness for "Tape for the
Turning of the Year" by Ammons, a poem that seems to me to anticipate
the Language poetics. I may be wrong about "the story." I'm usually
thinking out loud when I post. I'm anything, but not infallible.

That's a fair point. I did think about adding to the entry on Clarke,
but realized that the only thing I could do was go into my library
and reprint information from other people's research, which is
certainly what most of the entries on wikipedia consist of, hopefully
with proper credit. That didn't excite me much, and didn't seem all
that valuable to the public. I think if I had some original research
on Clarke or someone else, then I would feel obliged to put that up.
But, in the spirit of someone who still believes in the site, I will
take up your challenge and go beef up the entry, instead of
complaining. Check back if you're interes

As far as the racism charge (I think I said "race bias"), I don't
mean racism as the attitude of any individual or group, especially
given the editorial configuration of wikipedia. It just seems obvious
to me that the weighting of information on wikipedia reflects the
makeup of its contributors. One other thing Nature found out is that
wikipedia is actually better than Encyclopedia Brittanica on science
and technology, worse on humanities. I'm inclined to infer that there
are, then, more science and tech savvy contributors than lit-savvy
ones. Perhaps it is inaccurate to also make the inference that, among
those writing entries on American jazz musicians, more of them are
white than black. The only criticism I'd make beyond that is, if I
sat down and wrote a very long entry on Louis Bellson that repeated
the claim "the greatest drummer in the world", I'd feel a little
guilty about not going and giving credit to the guys whose shoulders
Bellson sat on (and certainly that includes Klook, Papa Jo Jones and
also Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich).

Subject: Malachi Ritscher: anti-war protester

SELF-IMMOLATION: A voluntary sacrifice or denial of
oneself, as for an ideal or another person.

Most famously demonstrated by Buddhist monk Thich
Quang Duc on June 11, 1963 in Vietnam.

Most recently demonstrated by musician Malachi
Ritscher in Chicago on November 3, 2006 as a protest
against the Iraq war.  One year ago, Malachi set
himself on fire next to the Kennedy Expressway during
morning rush hour.  He left a statement and obituary
on his website.
http://www.savagesound.com/gallery99.htm

As the Iraq War moves towards year 5,  I am taking
some time to think about Malachi.  I am wondering how
we find new ways to express our sadness, rage, and
disgust.  When does the turning point come?  When is
it enough?

Onwards,
Jennifer Karmin

Subject: Reading in Seattle, Sat Nov 10: Carletta Wilson & Jim Andrews

My friend Joe Keppler has a show up of steel sculpture in Seattle, so I'm
going south to see the show. He's a terrific poet, sculptor, sound artist,
photographer, and performer. His steel sculptures are very interesting and
often provocatively literary. Not concrete but steel. Meeting Joe back in
the 80's was a turning point in my life; Joe and some other artists in
Seattle I met back then have a strong intermedial, polyartistic side to
their literary work that makes Seattle a special place of literary
synthesis.

On Saturday Nov 10 I'll be doing a reading, as will Carletta Wilson, at
Joe's show of steel sculpture. I hope you can make it.

A perfect day in Maine


On the beach I walk and think, I hate these avatars of mine, they don't do
anything worthwhile at this point. It's too easy to make interesting
images and my brain is emptied out. Buddhist aggregates would fill it, but
then there's the problem they might end up annihilated, who wants empti-
ness when the replete amazes. I learn that if sound and sight are discon-
nected from production, why should I bother with meaning? Who wants to
just listen and watch, when everyone has heard and seen everything?

Why are there many rather than one? The ultimate koan - surely the number
is random, surely there would be meaningless degree? Or not? Mind won't
say. I can't even say rock, snail, woman, water.

The most difficult lesson: Some things have no causes at all.

I think it sounds nice but isn't very meaningful, which is probably
necessary in seeking for a general definition that distinguishes poetry fro=
m
prose.  However, even by that standard, the role of the audience is simply
too passive here.

Subject: Re: Deep Image (again)

Rothenberg & Kelly used it briefly =3D96 a few essays in Trobar, plus a =3D=
20=3D

letter exchange with Creeley and some other material. But neither of =3D20
them were into founding a school or movement as such. Back then, Bly =3D20
was somewhat close to them, and, as far as I know, once JR & RK lost =3D20
interest in formalizing their first insights and got busy elsewhere, =3D20
Bly ran with the concept. I have  a graduate student working on a diss =3D2=
0=3D

around Deep Image right now, & I hope he will come up with a =3D20
publishable book that would include all the essays & correspondence =3D20
around DI =3D96 which I believe was an important moment in post-War US =3D2=

poetry & poetics. In Clayton Eshleman's new collection of essays, =3D20
ARCHAIC DESIGN  (Black Widow Press), Clayton, in a foornote to his =3D20
piece on Olson, cites a recent letter from RK in which the latter =3D20
quotes Olson's response to his "Notes on the Poetry of Deep Image" : =3D20
"not imageS but image." Which shows I believe a very accurate =3D20
understanding of the original Deep Image project =3D96 while the later =3D2=

counterfeiters (Bly, Merwin etc) have gotten it exactly wrong: they =3D20
are all about imageS. =3D96 Pierre

I don't believe Ammons used that term or that it is normally applied to his=
 work. Robert Bly, Galway Kinnell, W.S. Merwin, and James Wright are names =
I see associated with the term. I would think that Ammons' use of technical=
 vocabularies would be the most important of a number of reasons why Ammons=
' work might be anathema to Bly and his colleagues.

I posted about "deep image." Merwin & J Wright have been lumped in that sch=
ool. I spoke of Ammons as an iconoclast, belonging to no school. I mentione=
d in one of my post my fondness for "Tape for the Turning of the Year" by A=
mmons, a poem that seems to me to anticipate the Language poetics. I may be=
 wrong about "the story." I'm usually thinking out loud when I post. I'm an=

This discussion has been quite interesting, & says a lot about the
attitudes people hold about wikipedia.  One thing that hasn't been
pointed out is that among young people (or at least those in my
world) wikipedia is used automatically as a portal into any inquiry.
Being children of the internet age I'm pretty sure most of them
realize  it is one possible source of information & not gospel.  & as
has been mentioned previous wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on
the net & gets tremendous amounts of traffic.  A couple references to
my projects generate hundreds of hits a month onto my own websites.

Wikipedia introduced Veropedia last month, which is the next logical
step in user-contributed content.  For those that use wikipedia for
research this may prove useful in the long term.  This is still in
the beta stage so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  From
the FAQ:

Veropedia is a collaborative effort by a group of Wikipedians to
collect the best of Wikipedia's content, clean it up, vet it, and
save it for all time. These articles are stable and cannot be edited,
The result is a quality stable version that can be trusted by
students, teachers, and anyone else who is looking for top-notch,
reliable information.

I am jumping in after your response, Diane. I remember how much James Wrigh=
t influenced me while I was in college. I thought his style was considered =
"common language"--(sounds almost like plain english in legal forms.) He se=
emed to be the epitome of the 1970's poet, especially in my part of the cou=
ntry--the midwest. I was just thinking about his poem, "Autumn Beings in Ma=
rtin's Ferry, Ohio."  The poem does not have the impact that it once had on=
 me, but I still find it poignant--and deep, if I understand the way you ar=
e using that term (which I may not be understanding at all).

it's strange that this recieved has so little media coverage seeing as acts
of self-immolation are really quite unusual. i'm not sure what to think of
his actions really, one hand thinks brave and commendable, the other thinks
"what a waste". in any case, this was the first i'd heard of it, so thanks
for the information....

of wishful thinking, I don't listen to what anyone says. I act with great

Janet Gyatso.) No one says anything and nothing happens. Deciding whatever
happens is fine is just fine, just being fine. Spontaneity is roomy and
everywhere, nothing's in the way, it's fine. Appearance dawns, it's not
always there, sometimes just a whisper or murmur, text is always a
glimpse, text isn't, the glimpse, I mean the problem with theory, glimpse
as concrete or harsh rendering. Dawn of text, there wasn't any, nothing in
roominess, then this! But it's since appearance dawns as text - there's
causality already at work, why? In any case of the world, everything that
occurs, which means not everything occurs, dawns as a key instruction,
there are signs to be read, appearance is instruction, appearance articu-
lates (otherwise it's not appearance).

i also must stand corrected (thanks aldon!) -- "tape for the turn of the
year" was first published in 1965. (never trust publication date you find on
amazon as it might be the reprint date!) i guess maybe i was conflating
"tape"with "glare," which is a later book-length poem.

Tom,

Ammons's *Tape* was first published by Cornell U. P. in 1965. One sees how
various schools are formed willy-nilly out of personal associations rather
than out of similarities of method or result in *the work* when one looks
at Ammons.

All the best,
John

Tom:

I hate to go all older brother on you, but my copy of Ammons's TAPE was
published in 1965  -- you're looking at a later reprinting --

Though the thought ot the LANGUAGE poets anticipating something that preceded
them has a certain appeal for a student of the future anterior like me --

Perhaps my last post gave the impression that Bly and company =93used=94 de=
ep image as a means of entering the mainstream American poetry establishmen=
t?  In this case, I suppose my argument is more that (whether deliberate or=
 not), folks like Bly and Merwin re-consider deep image in such a way that =
it is more easily assimilated into mainstream poetry in the 1960=92s and on=
.  When one reads Kelly and Rothenberg=92s statements regarding deep image,=
 they literally refer to the struggle that is the poem=92s composition.  Th=
ere is a material, physical exchange with language and the image.  This exc=
hange also makes demands upon the reader that is absent from Bly=92s deep i=
mage poetry, which I find affective at times.  This is also why it appears =
that Kelly and Rothenberg=92s =93struggle=94 with the deep image influenced=
 the Language Poets, as opposed to Bly and co.=92s reconsideration of deep =
image poetry.  I am certainly not against someone having =93new=94 or diver=
gent ideas; what concerns me is that all =93official=94 histories of deep i=
mage poetics (as opposed to books like D. Kane=92s _All Poets Welcome_, Ras=
ula=92s _American Poetry Wax Museum_, etc.) cite Bly as the originator of d=
eep image poetics.  These same official histories even exclude the work of =
folks like Zukofsky and the Objectivists, as well as Pound and Imagism, whi=
ch play a significant role in Kelly and Rothenberg=92s formulations.  As an=
 aside, there is also an interesting exchange between Levertov and Duncan i=
n their collected correspondence regarding Kelly and Rothenberg=92s develop=
ment of deep image poetics.=20
=20
 I am all for divergence, and I flinch at any demand for "purity" in poetry=
.   In fact, a close read of Kelly and Rothenberg's statements on deep imag=
e demonstrates that the two of them and the other folks associated with ear=
ly deep image, never came to nor tried to develop a "pure" and comprehensiv=
e "deep image poetics."  Thus the very idea of a deep image "school" of poe=
try already works against what Kelly and Rothenberg were working on in thei=
r early formulations. My issue is with the critics/editors who gloss over o=
r write Kelly and Rothenberg out of the deep image equation.  It would be b=
est if the history accounted for the work of Kelly and Rothenberg, and inco=
rporated the ways in which Bly and co. develop a different sense of the dee=
p image.  I think my last post was a reaction to surveying the tons o' poet=
ry anthologies intended for classroom use that simply delete Kelly and Roth=
enberg's work entirely (particularly Kelly), and celebrate Bly as the only =
poet investigating deep image.  I don't think Bly and co. "knew" they could=
 get into the Norton on their formulation of deep image; I just wish Norton=
 and other anthologies did not come across as the final word in what consti=
tutes deep image poetics (particularly in the classroom and on bookshelves =
in chain stores):  there's so much more to it and it is, in my opinion, a k=
ey chapter in Post-War and contemporary American poetry.   =20

he core group=92s attempt at conceptualizing deep image poetics. The deep i=
mage poetics associated with Bly, in fact, can either be considered a misre=
ading of Rothenberg and Kelly=92s statements, or indeed a serious divergenc=
e down another path. For Bly, a kind of solitude is necessary in deep image=
 poetics. Although Kelly and Rothenberg allude to energy and movement in re=
lation to the poetic image in their conception of the deep image, Bly omits=
 the participatory aspect of the image. Bly, the hero-poet, descends to the=
 depths of the unconscious and performs an act of recovery and articulation=
 for the reader, as opposed to the> demand for participation in the composi=
tion of the poetic space that Kelly, Rothenberg, Owens, and Schwerner deman=
d in their own work. For all of the paths Bly=92s deep image poetics attemp=
ts to reveal in the on-going struggle to re-connect humans to the cosmologi=
cal world, the main thrust of his poetics relies instead on =93plugging=94 =
the image into a pre-existing mythological system based much more firmly on=
 Jung=92s theory of the archetype and the collective unconscious (see Bly=
=92s _Iron John_). In fact, the casual way in which some dismiss the deep i=
mage as a pedestrian deployment of Jungian archetypal psychology and the la=

tributed to Bly=92s misreading.> > Bly and Wright (Bly=92s =93co-conspirato=
r=94) neglect the community-based origins of deep image poetics. Publicatio=
ns like Kelly and Economou=92s Trobar and the various poetry readings that =
the core group held imply that at the foundation of deep image poetics is t=
he concept that each of these spaces constitutes a site of resistance to th=
e absorption of Modern American poetry into the academy. Similarly, each of=
 these spaces opens up an arena for on-going conversations among poets and =
text, broadly defined. By placing translations of pre-modern, esoteric, tro=
ubadour, as well as Surrealist poetry and the work of figures like Lorca al=
ongside essays and poems which also consider the function of the rejected k=

Hi Jennifer,

I hope this post doesn=B9t take the discussion off track, it is not my
intention, but:

I just wanted to mention, for the record, that several Buddhist monks and
nuns self-immolated during the Vietnam war. One article in the Times, about
a young nun who died in this way on June 3 1966, moved me to write a short
poem (still in print in my Revolutionary Letters). When I wrote the Times t=
o
ask her name so that I could use in the title of my poem, they responded by
sending me the address in Asia of the correspondent who wrote the article. =
I
finally reached him and he wrote back that =B3Buddhist nuns didn=B9t have
names=B2--which was of course grossly untrue. It was interesting to me that
nearly every monk who self-immolated was mentioned by name when anyone
bothered to write about him at all, but that =B3Buddhist nuns didn=B9t have
names.=B2

All best,  Diane di Prima

SELF-IMMOLATION: A voluntary sacrifice or denial of
oneself, as for an ideal or another person.

Most famously demonstrated by Buddhist monk Thich
Quang Duc on June 11, 1963 in Vietnam.

Most recently demonstrated by musician Malachi
Ritscher in Chicago on November 3, 2006 as a protest
against the Iraq war.  One year ago, Malachi set
himself on fire next to the Kennedy Expressway during
morning rush hour.  He left a statement and obituary
on his website.
http://www.savagesound.com/gallery99.htm

As the Iraq War moves towards year 5,  I am taking
some time to think about Malachi.  I am wondering how
we find new ways to express our sadness, rage, and
disgust.  When does the turning point come?  When is
it enough?

Onwards,
Jennifer Karmin

Why Pierre, are you insinuating that Robert Bly is an opportunist? I
may have to challenge you to a duel. Preferably on the beach at
Cannes--we might as well combine it with a vacation.

I think this is a case of us vs. them -- that Rothenberg/Kelly's version of deep image is better than Bly/Wright/Merwin/Wakoski/Rich etc. etc. because of who they were published by and who they hung out with.  I think this mentality is an artifact of the seventies and eighties, and when we follow it we tend to recast the past to fit those assumptions.  A glance at lots of so-called mainstream publications show a much greater heterogeniety of poets, with writers of different groups reading and responding to each other's work.  Especially consider Bly's own publications (Fifties, Sixties, Seventies).  Although it's hard to think of an American poet who has done more to wreck their reputation than Bly, it's just not true that Bly or Wright or Merwin were uninterested in community, or that they  were comfortable with the relation between modern poetry and the academy or the larger American culture, or that Bly, Wright and Merwin were uninterested in pre-modern, esoteric,
 troubador and surrealist poets (they were all prolific translators and advocates of this sort of work).

These later deep image writers can be considered as negative influences, and intriguing in the sense that both Langpo and the New Formalists both sought to define themselves by how they were not like deep image.

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

Peter Monaco <petermonaco76@HOTMAIL.COM> wrote:

A cursory glance of most poetry anthologies, as well as the various histories of Modern American poetry that have been published since the 1960’s posit Bly as being the deep image “school’s” leading poet and theorist.  With the exception of some initial interactions between Bly and Rothenberg, there is little in Bly’s work to suggest that he fully grasped the core group’s attempt at conceptualizing deep image poetics.  The deep image poetics associated with Bly, in fact, can either be considered a misreading of Rothenberg and Kelly’s statements, or indeed a serious divergence down another path. For Bly, a kind of solitude is necessary in deep image poetics.  Although Kelly and Rothenberg allude to energy and movement in relation to the poetic image in their conception of the deep image, Bly omits the participatory aspect of the image.  Bly, the hero-poet, descends to the depths of the unconscious and performs an act of recovery and articulation for the reader, as opposed to
 the demand for participation in the composition of the poetic space that Kelly, Rothenberg, Owens, and Schwerner demand in their own work.  For all of the paths Bly’s deep image poetics attempts to reveal in the on-going struggle to re-connect humans to the cosmological world, the main thrust of his poetics relies instead on “plugging” the image into a pre-existing mythological system based much more firmly on Jung’s theory of the archetype and the collective unconscious (see Bly’s _Iron John_).  In fact, the casual way in which some dismiss the deep image as a pedestrian deployment of Jungian archetypal psychology and the latent structuralism of anthropologists like Levi-Strauss, can be directly attributed to Bly’s misreading.

Bly and Wright (Bly’s “co-conspirator”) neglect the community-based origins of deep image poetics.  Publications like Kelly and Economou’s Trobar and the various poetry readings that the core group held imply that at the foundation of deep image poetics is the concept that each of these spaces constitutes a site of resistance to the absorption of Modern American poetry into the academy.  Similarly, each of these spaces opens up an arena for on-going conversations among poets and text, broadly defined.  By placing translations of pre-modern, esoteric, troubadour, as well as Surrealist poetry and the work of figures like Lorca alongside essays and poems which also consider the function of the rejected knowledge that fuels the mythopoetic revolution (Gnostic texts, alchemical treatises, ritual chant and song) and the inherent politics of re-opening a dialogue with the “Other,” the performance spaces of the deep image group hinge upon participation and conversation to further
 the opening of the poetic field, towards Duncan’s “symposium of the whole.”  However, Bly and Wright initiate a deep image poetics that joins the rank of Bernstein’s “official verse culture.”  Bly and Wright use their misreading of deep image poetry to carve out a niche in the official (read: Norton) American poetry institution and to develop careers as “officially accredited” poets, thus re-affirming the more egocentric “hero-poet” model impertinent to Kelly, Rothenberg, and Economou’s sense of poetic community.

Thanks for posting this Jennifer. More people need to know about
brother Malachi Ritscher. Reading his mission statement brought me
back to last year when I had first heard the story of this man who
sacrificed his life in the hopes that he could call attention to the
horrible truths of the Iraq war. Everyone need not go as far as he
did, but it was his own autonomous choice. His memory and his voice
shall linger on.

since it was published in '65, perhaps my original comment is valid. i'm fond of Ammons. he seemed to have fun. lots of energy, ideas. not encumbered by academia. jorge borges is another incredibly erudite writer who was never pedantic. i'm reading his "The Craft of Verse." & loving it.

considering the influence of Ammons on poets at Cornell etc., then please

look straight at Alice Fulton

and even she, while recognizing his mentorship, is at pains to claim she
began using scientific language as metaphor before she considers herself to
have been mented by Ammons, who uses human interference with the natural

world in a -- a way that's interesting to compare and contrast with Fulton

I donno what your plaint really is is,
as Free wikipedia seems to have an
informative snapshot of what, exactly, "deep image" poetry is.

And why should we not be able to Name and Define our own world?

Or do you have a better definition?

Just asking

*Global Day of Action TODAY!!!*
 *Ban the Use and Export of U.S. Cluster Bombs*

*Call the U.S. Senate on TODAY (Monday, November 5)*

*Senate switchboard: 1-800-352-1897*
Cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that spew deadly shrapnel over
large swathes of land at the time of use and leave behind fields of
landmines after combat ends. As a result, over the last 40 years the vast
majority - 98% - of cluster bomb casualties have been civilians.
More than 80 countries have agreed to negotiate a ban on these
indiscriminate killers in 2008.  The U.S. government is not one of the
countries, arguing that the military's need for these weapons over-rides
humanitarian concerns.  However, these weapons are even a liability for the
military, as the unexploded bomblets impede troop movement and have
already killed U.S. soldiers in Iraq.
One of the American Task Force for Lebanon Legislative Council's  (ATFL-LC)
priorities is passage in the coming year of Senate Bill 594 and House Bill
1755, *The* *Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Acts of 2007. *  ATFL-LC
is participating in a *national call-in day on Monday, November 5 to urge
Senators to co-sponsor Senate Bill 594*.  This initiative takes place as
part of a broader *Global Day of Action on Cluster Bombs * called by the
worldwide Cluster Munitions Coalition to help propel the global cluster bomb
treaty negotiations.
*We invite you to take part.  *It's easy.  There is *toll-free number
(1-800-352-1897),* which will allow people to call the Capitol Switchboard
for free.  Two websites are set up to let people know the basics of calling
(when, what, where, why, how). Please feel free to direct people to these
sites and/or the phone number. The main website is:
http://www.fcnl.org/landing/clusterbombcall.htm

***
Following is additional information for the Monday, November 5 National Call
in to *Ban U.S. Cluster Bombs*!
*What?*
National call-in day to the Senate, urging senators to cosponsor Senate
Bill.594 (the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2007).   This
legislation would substantially restrict both the use and export of cluster
bombs by:
1) requiring that they not be used in areas where civilians are known to be
present, and
2) requiring that they have a "dud rate" of less than 1% (meaning that they
will leave behind fewer deadly submunitions on the ground after the combat
ends).
*Why?*
Monday, November 5 is a *Global Day of Action* against cluster bombs.
People all over the world are taking action to urge the banning of these
indiscriminate killers.  The call-in day is a chance to let our Senators
know that there is strong public opposition to these inhumane weapons in the
U.S. and strong support for Senate Bill 594.
*When?*
Make calls on Monday, November 5, any time. Regular business hours are
better, as you will get to talk to a real person (instead of leaving a
message). Calls on other days are also encouraged but the more we can
concentrate on November 5, the better.
*How?*
*Calls to the Senate can be made for free on (800) 352-1897.  Callers will
automatically be redirected to the Capitol Switchboard. They will need to
ask for their Senator by name. Once directed to the office, ask for the
Legislative Assistant who deals with military and national security issues.
Urge them to become a co-sponsor of S.594 and to work for its passage in the
coming year.  *

*Call Your Senators Today,
Day of Action on Cluster Bombs*


 Today, *Monday, November 5*, the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation
joins the Friends Committee on National Legislation, Amnesty International
USA, United for Peace and Justice, and many other organizations in a global
day of action on cluster bombs.
  **

During its war on Lebanon last summer, Israel dropped 130,000 cluster bombs
containing 1.2 million cluster bomblets in 498 locations in villages
throughout the south of the country. Unexploded cluster bomblets
subsequently have injured and killed civilians.  Only 20% of Israel's
unexploded cluster bombs have been cleared in Lebanon because Israel has
refused to turn over cluster munitions strike data to the UN.  These cluster
bombs are given to Israel by the United States and paid for by U.S.
taxpayers like you.
When countries gather in early December to continue negotiating a global
cluster bomb ban treaty, the U.S. will be conspicuously absent. The U.S.
should not isolate itself on yet another issue of global concern. Congress
needs to pass the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act (S.594) next
year to bring the U.S. into line with the emerging global consensus against
the use of a weapon which overwhelmingly kills civilians. *Call your
senators on November 5 and ask them to support this bill.*
Who Should You Call?

   - *Do you live in California or Vermont?* Both your senators are
   already supporting this bill, so you don't need to call them today. But you
   can write to your
representative<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=Iqmz3hCz2uv0/xuz5XblwIj1lQVvcZzO>and
urge her or him to cosponsor the companion bill in the House.
   - *Do you live in Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Ohio,
   Rhode Island, Washington, or Wisconsin? *One of your senators has
   already cosponsored, so please call your other senator! Senators that need
   calls are Charles Grassley (IA), Ben Cardin (MD), John Kerry (MA), Pete
   Domenici (NM), George Voinovich (OH), Jack Reed (RI), Patty Murray (WA), or
   Herb Kohl (WI).
   - *Do you live in any other state?* You should call both of your
   senators and ask them to cosponsor the bill!

How to Make Your Calls

   - *Call your senators using FCNL's special toll free number: (800)
   352-1897*
   - This number connects you to the Capitol Switchboard. You will need
   to ask for your senator by name. Find out who your senators
are<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=fMORocCcnOntuBbNE9/ZIIj1lQVvcZzO>
   .
   - Once you are directed to the office, ask to speak to the legislative
   assistant who deals with military and national security issues.
   - After you call one senator's office, call back and ask for your
   other senator.

Script for your Call Please feel free to improvise and add additional
information.

   - My name is [NAME], and I live in [CITY, STATE].Thanks for taking my
   call.
   - I'm calling to encourage Senator [SENATOR'S NAME] to cosponsor S.
   594, the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act. Will that be possible?
   - Thank you.

The administration's position is that the military benefits outweigh the
civilian costs. We
disagree.<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=VtEOnsLlGnUAO%2BVOCrSx4/sQjjc0hLeT>

Elizabeth, perhaps another distinction I'd rather not draw is that
between the 'state of literature' and 'external circumstances'. You
might say just so long as prose rules the world blurring its boundaries
with poetry remains worth doing. I don't go for the idea that poetry
creates meaning, prose conveys it. All writing does both to such an
extent I'd want to hold all writers to account for doing both. I don't
know whether Tomas meant that writing that creates meaning, IS poetry
(whether we take it to be poetry or prose, like on the page or in a
Creative Writing class on poetry) or that what we take to be poetry
CREATES MEANING. Either way, I'm against it.
I take your point about reading, and its relation to time management and
personal entertainment value, what what other purposes are being served?
Cheers, Wystan    =20

Wystan, playing into the hands of what?  When you say "the age" do you
refer to the state of literature or to external circumstances? If the
former, I suppose one could argue, if they were so inclined, that enough
blurring of the boundaries has happened for it to be useful to attempt
to redraw them (if only as an experiment).

For me, the primary difference between poetry and prose is not in how I
write them (certain types of prose excepted) but in how I read them.  My
reading of poetry is much slower and deliberate to the point where I've
even been known to say that I read prose and think about poetry.
Exceptions to this are James Joyce and crappy poetry, which is to say
great prose and crappy poetry, though that says much more about my
personal preferences and biases than anything else, of course.

I agree with Pete, it is quite necessary to be infuriated by these sorts
of reductive understandings of a complex poetic form. If the common notion
of this form its sort of bastardized version then a mistake has definitely
been made. Not that I think Bly's work should be completely cut out of the
picture, no not at all it is such reinventions and divergences that keep
poetry alive. Instances of "making it new" (and making of new) are the
lifeblood of poetic evolution. Nothing should stand as The Official
Version, especially when the originators were against purity of form in
general.

As Pierre writes in his Nomad Manifesto "Purity is the root of all evil."

Quite. I've been reading so much and such various prose recently- Arto
Paasilinna, Marguerite Yourcenar, David Albahari, Atiq Rahimi, Michele
Desbordes and many others - that such distinctions seem meaninglessly
self-aggrandising. Poetry holds no inherent virtue just because it's
poetry.There's no firm dividing line between the conventions that say
something is prose and something else is poetry. And all these are permeable
to "external circumstances" (whatever they are?)

Cheers

Thanks, Peter. I've written a brush whose shape is whatever text you type
in, but i haven't made anything interesting with it so far. Partly that was
because, like the other brushes, it was painting at 30+ frames per second.
So it'd lay down an awful lot of text very quickly; the texts were too dense
on the screen to be readable or even discernable, sometimes, as text. Last
night I put in a 'frames per second' control for each brush, so a brush can
now lay down strokes/text at whatever pace seems appropriate.

Am slowly working toward each brush you create having its own 'palette'. The
idea is that a 'palette' can be a search term--so that the brush 'paints'
with images downloaded via that search term; or a palette can be a bunch of
images from a directory on the hard drive; or a palette can be a color or a
gradient.

So, like, you could create one brush and make its palette the word "good"
(so it'd paint with images downloaded from the net associated with the word
"good"); another brush might have an "evil" palette. ding. they come out
painting. the battle of the brushes, the battle of "good" versus "evil".

the brushes themselves might be text brushes--so that the "good" brush makes
paint strokes in the shape of the word "good" where the word-shapes/'paint
strokes' are filled with images associated with the word "good"--or they
might be different shapes other than text.

there's a difference between not liking where a distinction is drawn and
making a case for drawing no distinction at all. i personally am with
Elizabeth in the feeling that I've personally had enough of this post
structuralist impulse toward collapsing distinctions. 1.) distinctions
are useful for all sorts of things & 2.) frankly criticism musing about
the nature of meaning bores me to tears, doesn't seem to generative or
useful, and frankly is starting to look sort of self-indulgent and lazy
& 3.) anyway, there are better philosophies and aesthetics than the
stuff that formed the foundations of critical theory and cultural
studies over the last 25 years or so. I'd like to say that poetry has
line breaks and prose doesn't, but there are too many prose poets and
flash fictionaries that have muddied that water up, so we're left with
something that is fundamentally a structural issue in that it relates to
the architecture of language arts, but against which there's been such
an assault for no apparently good reason that we no longer have a way to
draw a line where one is useful.

perhaps more to the point is the reading angle, but for me, honestly, my
reading habits aren't that different for poetry or for prose. I find
Ezra Pound as absorbing as I find Philip K. Dick, and respond to them
both in similar ways albeit for different reasons. which is why for me,
the impulse is to draw the distinction from a compositional point of
view. And that works for me, and not only that, but i find it works also
when I'm reading other people as well. If I read something about
"poetry" and I subsitute "language art composed at the level of the
sentence" it works and can makes sense of what is being said, just as if
I read something aobut "prose" and substitute "language art composed at
the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to
the nature of information being conveyed by the two different species.

Wystan: It's a little difficult to continue this conversation without any
definite sense of what the world that prose apparently rules is and how
prose can be said to rule it.  But I have to question whether it's valuable
to bend one's work in a particular way for the sake of power to rule [over
something], which I see as distinct from the sort of power that vibrates
between the poem and the reader until at least one has the top of their head
cut off.

As for the purposes served by my divergent reading styles, I would say it
has more to do with my craft interest as a writer than with "time management
and personal entertainment value".

That's evocative, Peter. It reminds me of the industrial downtown of big
cities. And the role of thought there. Usually thought in industrial
scenarios is of engineering and steel/concrete withstanding the forces at
play. And lots of crash and bang, materials worn. Interesting to see
typographic symbols in such a situation.

It also reminds me of when I saw Joe Keppler's back yard some time ago. He's
a poet-sculptor. Steel is his main material. Looking out the kitchen window
at the back yard, I saw a big kind of dump of 'raw material' for his
sculpture. Lots of scrap steel, but it had already started to bend to
language. It was strikingly like junk steel but also there were sort of
creaks and groans and bends of language in there already. Parts of other
architectures. Engineering architectures and writerly/sculptural
architectures.

How typographic symbols hold an image, create and hold an image. The piece
I'm working on also fills language with images from the net. You also are
filling language with images. Interesting how the two types of images and
languages start to 'speak' at once: the meanings and images of typographic
language and the meanings and images of visual language.

Jason:

"If I read something about
"poetry" and I subsitute "language art composed at the level of the
sentence" it works and can makes sense of what is being said, just as if
I read something aobut "prose" and substitute "language art composed at
the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to

But from my observation - as a reader and a writer of prose and poetry -
novels are composed at the level of the _sentence_, not the paragraph  - and
what about people like Jose Saramago or David Albahari, who don't use
paragraphs at all? (As Patrick White said - one of the most illuminating and
helpful things I've ever read about writing novels - a novel is written
sentence by sentence.) You could perhaps make the beginnings of a
distinction here, by saying that - as I believe - poetry is composed in
lines (I don't think poetry has much to do with sentences at all, frankly).
Even if, as in a prose poem, it's a very long line. Or you could say with
Olson that poetry is composed in the syllable and the ear, which might take
care of the flash poetry. I don't think either art is about "the nature of
information" they "convey". Both _are_ something. Yes, they differ, but I've
never read a satisfactory account of what that difference is. Maybe the
crudest is best -there's something encyclopaedic about novels, they amass
detail, while poems discard it.

Elizabeth, I don't understand what you mean - are you saying the decision to
write prose is about a desire for power? What kind of prose do you mean?
What kind of power? There are prose works that equally "vibrate" with the
reader, that are as multiple as any poems. Maybe you're referring to a
particular kind of prose and I am thinking of another. I presume we're
talking about what's generally and perhaps a little depressingly known as
"creative prose".

I've no objection to distinctions. I do however find claims that poetry is
somehow inherently superior to prose (it doesn't seek power, it relinquishes
some kind of control, prose is a vehicle, poetry the passenger, whatever)
irksome. As are claims to the reverse.

All best

I am wondering if those who know of poems of Paul's over the years that did not appear in the collected by Jarolim would be willing to send me copies and also where they first appeared in. I am working on a new collected with some of of his friends and will leave it at that. All those with these types of donations will appear in print in a University Press if all works the way I suppose it will.

Hi all

Here's a link to 'Dive' if you get in the mood for a bit of maritime
immersion while you work.
http://www.abc.net.au/rn/poetica/stories/2007/2054828.htm  Dive is a sound
poem featuring whales, eels, fish, dolphins, snapping shrimp, icebergs and
other assorted marine animals, scientists, music, noise and environmental
sounds. The poetry is being read by Marine archivist Shelagh Smith, who is
incredible. There's a brief interview about the creation of 'Dive' which was
developed between 2004-2006 after a residency at the Cornell Ornithology
Lab.  I hope you are near a good sound system. The link won't be up for long

Best wishes

Sorry for being so indefinite, Elizabeth, but conversations--and I know =
'discussion group' exchanges give the mere  illusion of =
conversation--conversations do need to roll with their indefiniteness. I =
mean what did tomas mean by prose?  I don't really know, he was lots =
more gnomic that I was. But just for starters, in answer to your =
question: it is obvious that there's a great deal of prose about, so =
much you'd hardly know poetry even existed--prose is quantitatively =
dominant. It certainly rules in my workplace--a university--how is it in =
yours? It certainly, as fiction, dominates contemporary literature. I =
know it sounds like a monster already,
with many heads, and special powers (Jason suspects post-structuralist =
powers!), but in the meantime you could cut me some hyperbole.

Wystan: It's a little difficult to continue this conversation without =
any
definite sense of what the world that prose apparently rules is and how
prose can be said to rule it.  But I have to question whether it's =
valuable
to bend one's work in a particular way for the sake of power to rule =
[over
something], which I see as distinct from the sort of power that vibrates
between the poem and the reader until at least one has the top of their =
head
cut off.

As for the purposes served by my divergent reading styles, I would say =
it
has more to do with my craft interest as a writer than with "time =
management
and personal entertainment value".

Jason (1) for my money, the impulse to collapse distinctions is also the =

then? Or Faulkner.

there's a difference between not liking where a distinction is drawn and
making a case for drawing no distinction at all. i personally am with
Elizabeth in the feeling that I've personally had enough of this post
structuralist impulse toward collapsing distinctions. 1.) distinctions
are useful for all sorts of things & 2.) frankly criticism musing about
the nature of meaning bores me to tears, doesn't seem to generative or
useful, and frankly is starting to look sort of self-indulgent and lazy
& 3.) anyway, there are better philosophies and aesthetics than the
stuff that formed the foundations of critical theory and cultural
studies over the last 25 years or so. I'd like to say that poetry has
line breaks and prose doesn't, but there are too many prose poets and
flash fictionaries that have muddied that water up, so we're left with
something that is fundamentally a structural issue in that it relates to
the architecture of language arts, but against which there's been such
an assault for no apparently good reason that we no longer have a way to
draw a line where one is useful.

perhaps more to the point is the reading angle, but for me, honestly, my
reading habits aren't that different for poetry or for prose. I find
Ezra Pound as absorbing as I find Philip K. Dick, and respond to them
both in similar ways albeit for different reasons. which is why for me,
the impulse is to draw the distinction from a compositional point of
view. And that works for me, and not only that, but i find it works also
when I'm reading other people as well. If I read something about
"poetry" and I subsitute "language art composed at the level of the
sentence" it works and can makes sense of what is being said, just as if
I read something aobut "prose" and substitute "language art composed at
the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to
the nature of information being conveyed by the two different species.

> Is this software you have written? Is it similar to Photoshop brushes?

Yes, it is software I'm writing called dbCinema. And it's related to
Photoshop brushes, but dbCinema brushes are different.

The basic idea of Photoshop brushes is that you paint with a brush whose
shape is drawn from a preset set of brushes or you can make your own brush
shapes. And it draws in the color of your choosing. Also, you can size
Photoshop brushes and change their opacity. You can also make Photoshop
brushes rotate.

In this, dbCinema brushes are the same as Photoshop brushes. You can do some
things with Photoshop brushes that you can't do with dbCinema brushes and
vice versa.

dbCinema brushes go beyond Photoshop brushes in some ways. For instance, you
can use multiple dbCinema brushes at once, and the location of brushes can
either be mouse-controlled or they can traverse a configurable path chosen
from a set of dbCinema 'geometries'. Also, what dbCinema brushes are filled
with can be parts of images downloaded from the net, not just a particular
color.

dbCinema brushes are mainly for painting 'movies' rather than for creating
still images. Though they can also create some interesting still images. The
position of Photoshop brushes is always mouse-controlled. They're not meant
to be generative art oriented (where part of the idea is to get algorithms
to be at least partially active in the art creation).

I came across some related work tonight you and others might find of
interest.

Here is the eponymous site of a USAmerican artist-programmer:
http://davebollinger.com . There are quite a few striking images and
animated, sometimes interactive applets on Dave Bollinger's site. He is
involved in 'generative art'. He writes programs (usually using the
Java-based 'Processing' programming language) that generate visual art.
There's also a well-done blog at http://www.generatorx.no masterminded by
Marius Watz, a well-known artist-programmer. This blog has a wealth of
articles and links to generative art projects and other projects usually
involving programming.

Whenever something is drawing (or writing) something, you might as well say
a 'brush' or a 'pen' is being used to do the drawing or painting or
whatever. So, in a sense, generative visual art is all about creating new
types of brushes or pens. Which of course can also be writing implements,
and sometimes are even as they draw or paint or whatever.

The guitar;
the electric guitar.

The pen;
the digital pen.

I'm incredibly lazy. I simply refer to Bloom's canon. Faulkner/fiction. Rilke/Auden:
poetry. Life is so much easier for the bookish.

there's a difference between not liking where a distinction is drawn and
making a case for drawing no distinction at all. i personally am with
Elizabeth in the feeling that I've personally had enough of this post
structuralist impulse toward collapsing distinctions. 1.) distinctions
are useful for all sorts of things & 2.) frankly criticism musing about
the nature of meaning bores me to tears, doesn't seem to generative or
useful, and frankly is starting to look sort of self-indulgent and lazy
& 3.) anyway, there are better philosophies and aesthetics than the
stuff that formed the foundations of critical theory and cultural
studies over the last 25 years or so. I'd like to say that poetry has
line breaks and prose doesn't, but there are too many prose poets and
flash fictionaries that have muddied that water up, so we're left with
something that is fundamentally a structural issue in that it relates to
the architecture of language arts, but against which there's been such
an assault for no apparently good reason that we no longer have a way to
draw a line where one is useful.

perhaps more to the point is the reading angle, but for me, honestly, my
reading habits aren't that different for poetry or for prose. I find
Ezra Pound as absorbing as I find Philip K. Dick, and respond to them
both in similar ways albeit for different reasons. which is why for me,
the impulse is to draw the distinction from a compositional point of
view. And that works for me, and not only that, but i find it works also
when I'm reading other people as well. If I read something about
"poetry" and I subsitute "language art composed at the level of the
sentence" it works and can makes sense of what is being said, just as if
I read something aobut "prose" and substitute "language art composed at
the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to
the nature of information being conveyed by the two different species.

Aren't we forgetting something- namely that poetry was FIRST, and if
anybody needs to distinguish themselves its these prose mutants.

i say this with some degree of deference:

isn't poetry more musical? poets count.

novelist seldom speak in such minimal, linguistic terms.
when i read a joyce carol oates essay, she refers to  character, plot.
the rest is mostly academic horse shit to working writers.

I read something aobut "prose" and substitute "language art composed at
the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to
the nature of information being conveyed by the two different species.

Jim,

You said: "images and languages start to 'speak'

Yes, that "inbetween" is what I am concentrating on, the interior space, the
inner voice, the point where the brain begins to recognize recognizes
language and demands meaning.

Alison: I don't think that the decision to write prose is about a desire for
power: I was attempting to clarify what Wystan meant about prose ruling the
world and to consider some of the potential implications of that and the
rest of what he had to say.

Wystan: yes, conversations do often involve a degree of indefiniteness, but
I really can't have a discussion with you if I don't know what you're
talking about.  If you're talking about sheer volume, which seems to be the
implication of your most recent email, I'm still not really sure how that's
a recommendation for blurring boundaries.  Nor do I think you have any
"powers": it's simply that your email seemed to imply that seeking power was
a reasonable aim for one's writing (in that a poet should blur boundaries
with prose since prose "rules").  If I misunderstood, I'm sorry, but that's
what happens when one rolls with indefiniteness, I'm afraid.

hello all,

here's an unfortunate, dismissive take on gertrude stein by way of reviewing
janet malcom's recent bio:

"I happily admit I haven't read The Making of Americans (1934) and have no
intention of doing so, since it's half a million words long, and almost all
of those sound like this: I mean, I mean and that is not what I mean. I mean
that not any one is saying what they are meaning. I mean that I am feeling
something, I mean that I mean something and I mean that not any one is
thinking, is feeling, is saying, is certain of that thing, I mean that not
any one can be. And so on and so forth."

"Her charm emerges periodically in her books. The Autobiography of Alice B
Toklas (1933) is a perfect, lucid delight; Tender Buttons (1914) sounds, not
unattractively, like the work of Edith Sitwell after a pint or two of vodka;
and Wars I Have Seen (1944) is disconcertingly indistinguishable in style
and in every respect from the Anita Loos novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
(1925)."

"But was Stein really all that interested in anything? You would be hard-put
to extract any cogent statement on any subject from almost any of her
books."

*A Brief View of the Hudson
http://www.myspace.com/abriefviewofthehudson

=B3It=B9s not often that a band sounds like nothing you've ever heard and still
sounds good. That's what you get from A Brief View of the Hudson.=B2 (N.Y.
Sun) This unconventional trio is the brainchild of Texan Ann Enzminger and
Canadian Nicholas Nace. Their off-kilter songs and music combine acoustic
guitars, streaming riffs and =B3=8A Ann Enzminger=B9s arrestingly powerful vocals=
,
which are well tuned to the duo=B9s graceful songs of indie-folk heart.=B2 (Tim=
e
Out NY) They also were recently named =B3Best Folk Duo of 2005=B2 by N.Y. Press=
.
Since meeting in  drama school and forming the band four years ago, the pai=
r
have become veterans of the downtown performance scene and are the house
band every Monday night for the =B3belly laugh funny=B2(N.Y. Sun) O=B9Debra Twins
=B3Show & Tell=B2 open mic at the Bowery Poetry Club. In 2004 they self-release=
d
their =B3=8A beautifully imperfect =8A=B2 (Americana-uk.com) debut EP Go North to
Find Me on their own North/South Records label and followed it up in early
2005 with the release of The Art Star Sounds Compilation, entirely produced
and compiled by Nicholas Nace. Joel Herzig joined the duo as their full tim=
e
bass player in the summer of 2006, and the trio has been performing non-sto=
p
ever since.


*Dead Rabbit
www.myspace.com/deadrabbitmusic
=20
Dead Rabbit is a progressive indie rock band from Staten Island. They sound
like David Bowie, Jefferson Airplane, and ABBA having a crazy orgy weekend.


*Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://dibson.net/
http://www.myspace.com/dibson/
The latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk ingenues, including Beck, Ada=
m
Green and Jeffrey Lewis, Dibs applies that time-honored tradition of
off-beat songwriting to his own private world of sugar factories, laundry
baskets and ducks. With a low voice, both sweet and deadpan, and a
guitar-style both virtuosic and sloppy, Dibson Hoffweiler carves out a spac=
e
of compassion and intelligence in a landscape of boring love songs and
thinly-veiled songwriterly misogyny.


*The Trouble Dolls
http://www.troubledolls.net/

Trouble Dolls are Cheri, Matty, and Chris. They play pop music. They are
from Brooklyn. They do not smoke. Their album "Sticky" is available on Half
a Cow Records. They thank you for coming to see them play.

'what she sang was uttered word by word' (Stevens, 'The Idea of Order at Key West') = (a certain idea of) poetry

But from my observation - as a reader and a writer of prose and poetry -
novels are composed at the level of the _sentence_, not the paragraph - and
what about people like Jose Saramago or David Albahari, who don't use
paragraphs at all? (As Patrick White said - one of the most illuminating and
helpful things I've ever read about writing novels - a novel is written
sentence by sentence.) You could perhaps make the beginnings of a
distinction here, by saying that - as I believe - poetry is composed in
lines (I don't think poetry has much to do with sentences at all, frankly).
Even if, as in a prose poem, it's a very long line. Or you could say with
Olson that poetry is composed in the syllable and the ear, which might take
care of the flash poetry. I don't think either art is about "the nature of
information" they "convey". Both _are_ something. Yes, they differ, but I've
never read a satisfactory account of what that difference is. Maybe the
crudest is best -there's something encyclopaedic about novels, they amass
detail, while poems discard it.

Elizabeth, I don't understand what you mean - are you saying the decision to
write prose is about a desire for power? What kind of prose do you mean?
What kind of power? There are prose works that equally "vibrate" with the
reader, that are as multiple as any poems. Maybe you're referring to a
particular kind of prose and I am thinking of another. I presume we're
talking about what's generally and perhaps a little depressingly known as
"creative prose".

I've no objection to distinctions. I do however find claims that poetry is
somehow inherently superior to prose (it doesn't seek power, it relinquishes
some kind of control, prose is a vehicle, poetry the passenger, whatever)
irksome. As are claims to the reverse.

All best

A

i hate to be a jerk, but isn't "musical" one of those non-descriptive words
masquerading as descriptive?  saying poetry is musical is as meaningless as
calling it "interesting" or "organic".

poetry is (in my mind) all about precision.  musical doesn't do the job.  we
can talk about rhythm, cadence, alliteration, etc.

perhaps i've had too much coffee already.

Jim, Peter,

Yes, the connection between the visual and language, the explosive gap they
have to cross to create meanings, that's the underlying concern in poetry in
our time, I think.

In reference to the relationship between architecture and junk, I think any
building becomes beautiful as it becomes decoupled from its ostensible
function; use makes it invisible. "Uselessness" gives buildings beauty.
That's why, I think,19th century factory spaces for example are beautiful.
Of course, this is the very reverse of the Bauhaus aesthetics. But we live
in a new world.

Did anyone see the documentary "Industrial Landscapes?"

I have a review of Bill Berkson's book of lectures, *Sudden Address*, which
just came out in The Poetry Project Newsletter and which will appear in two
different versions in Eilleen Tabios's *Galathea Resurrected* and Douglas
Messerli's *Green Integer* blog. The review says things about the issue in
question.

Also, my book *The Peripheral Space of Photography* is all about the
relationship between photographic image and language.

Ciao,

Murat

I think Jim is onto something important here. What differentiates prose from
poetry, in our time, is the size of the expected audience -or, are you
speaking to an audience outside you or are you yourself the original
audience you are appealing to.

Outside of mathematics and certain kinds of philosophy, categories
that are clear enough tend to blur at the borders. Urban/rural?
Forest/field? The categories are functional, which is what counts.
The border region can be seen as a separate zone--edge-of-the-forest,
or for that matter, where-prose-and-poetry-meet--with its own
characteristics that can be useful to talk about. This doesn't remove
the blurriness--the new zone has its own border regions, because
we'rereally talking about points on a continuum. It seems to me that
that's the way things are, despite whatever taste for tidiness.

What I don't understand is why any writer should care beyond her/his
own practice. As an anthologist I generally accept a writer's
categorization of his work. If Baudelaire considers one thing a poem,
another a prose poem, another prose (of which he wrote a fair
amount), etc., I see no reason to argue with him. As a critic I might
be able to tease something out of the demonstrable differences in his
practice. As a writer myself, I write.

Subject: Re: Deep Image (again)

I find it infuriating that on this list one immediately reaches for accusations
of careerism and the like in order to attribute motivations to poets who have
divergent ideas. Isn't it enough to say that Bly and co. had an impoverished
notion of "deep image" without having to say they developed this just because
they knew that such a concept would be the key to getting into the Norton
Anthology?

  Barry, I so agree with you on this!!!!
  This has to be said!
  Thank you  very much for saying so!
  Bobbi Lurie

Why Pierre, are you insinuating that Robert Bly is an opportunist? I
may have to challenge you to a duel. Preferably on the beach at
Cannes--we might as well combine it with a vacation.

Mark--
I always say this: "I....(i never say may have to)....challenge you to a duel"
The setting sounds perfect.
May I observe and make sure this is done with precision/ according to
tradition?
hopefully--

Having been a musician - jazz, latin, blues, African - prior to getting into
writing poetry, I take offense at 'musical' being described as
non-descriptive. Poetry has always been associated with music. Music is
sound. And what is poetry other than sound and the placing of sounds in a
melodious cadence - with as much dissonance as the poet hears. Just as the
development of Western Classical Music has been the opening of music to
dissonance (consider the Gregorian and other Chants compared to say
Schoenberg or Stravinsky), it seems to me that the development of modern and
post-modern poetry has been nothing more than opening the poem to dissonance
- which is nothing other than music. In conclusion, let me paraphrase what
one of the greats of North American music said regarding 'swing' - you know
it when you hear it. And if poetry, of whatever classification or category,
doesn't have music, it doesn't sing and it definitely doesn't work because
even the most dissonant of post-modernism swings in its own way and if
you're open you can hear it singing to you.

i hate to be a jerk, but isn't "musical" one of those non-descriptive words
masquerading as descriptive?  saying poetry is musical is as meaningless as
calling it "interesting" or "organic".

poetry is (in my mind) all about precision.  musical doesn't do the job.  we
can talk about rhythm, cadence, alliteration, etc.

perhaps i've had too much coffee already.

One needn't resort to dismissal or ad homina, Barry. It's entirely
possible that someone who disagrees with you has no dark motives to conceal.

It must have been in 1970 that Bly read to a small crowd of faculty
and graduate students at Barnard College in New York. Most of the
undergraduates were probably too invested in political ferment at the
time, in the second year of almost non-stop rioting, to attend. After
he lectured all of us about marriage for a half hour, apparently
thinking we were 18 years old (I looked around the room and counted
1.5 marriages per attendee, most of whom I knew) he read us a poem
that was apparently his set piece of those years about finding a
dying sea lion behind a dune after the Santa Barbara oil spill. In
the poem he goes back every day, recording the animal's increasing
agony, until it died on the seventh day, when the sky opened and Bly
had a Wordsworthian epiphany. It was apparently a big hit with most
crowds. Me, I was furious. What a self-indulgent shit. A call to the
ASPCA would have resulted in a quicker, kinder death. But without the
epiphany. The people I spoke to felt the same.

This was years before the utter disgrace of his Iron John phase. But
he was already willing to make use of anything for his ends.

Not everyone who wears a cape is a superhero.

By the way, he's a very bad translator.

But maybe I'm just jealous.

I'm proud to announce my new editing venture. Anti-, an online poetry =
journal set to launch in early 2008, seeks submissions.

Anti- is not aesthetically affiliated with Nicanor Parra's school of =
antipoetry, though the editor does share his skepticism about the =
supposed mystical powers of poetry. Anti- primarily stands against the =
confinement of poetry to too-small boxes. Anti- wants to provide a voice =
for a wide range of styles and ideas in the same space, so these =
different kinds of poets and poems can either fight it out or learn to =
coexist. We're also interested in work that blurs boundaries: between =
verse and prose, traditional and cutting edge, humorous and scary, =
narrative and lyric and linguistically fragmented.

Send three to seven original, unpublished poems as an attachment (Word =
.doc or RTF) to antipoetry@anti-poetry.com. Either in the file or the =
body of the e-mail, include a cover letter with your name, contact =
information, a contributor-note biography of 50 words or less, and a =
statement of 50 words or less on what you're against in poetry. This =
statement can be general or specific to your submitted poems, serious or =
tongue in cheek, broad or ridiculously minute. It needs to be something =
you want to appear on your page if we accept your work.

Angela,

Organic, as a description for poetry or other art forms, has a long history. (http://christianhubert.com/writings/organicism.html)

In the correspondence of Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, they used the term Organic, and that use seems quite interesting, especially coupled with the notion of the organismic paradigm on which it is based. (Certainly it is documented that Charles Olson's process is based on Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism. See Shahar Bram's "Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead: An Essay on Poetry").

Given the Reductionist (competition/domination) mentality of the Bush Administration, it would seem that Organic, and Organismic is quite timely and relevant.

poetry is (in my mind) all about precision. musical doesn't do the job. we
can talk about rhythm, cadence, alliteration, etc.

perhaps i've had too much coffee already.

Diane, I think your points are very relevant.  Whose
job is it to name and remember those who sacrifice
themselves during a war -- be it a monk, protester,
terrorist, or soldier?  How do the names of the dead
change when listed in the news vs. listed in a poem
vs. not being listed at all?

I agree that one of the most troubling facts is that
the local/national media has not given Malachi and his
actions much attention.  This seems in line with the
general coverage of the Iraq war.  It reminds me that
wars are designed, created, and scripted with their
own invented words for us to consume.  Or, we don't
consume these words.  We turn them upside down and
make them new.

Malachi was an important member of Chicago's vibrant
experimental music community.  At the time of his
death last year, the music site Pitchfork featured
some useful writing.
http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39663-malachi-ritscher-1954-2006

Last week, Chicago Public Radio aired an interview
with Malachi's sister.
http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/Content.aspx?audioID=14415

Thanks to all who've shared their ideas with me both
on and off the list,
Jennifer

Thanks for taking the bait, Allison. To be honest these are some thoughts that aren't fully formed yet, and I was kind of hoping that by sending them out sort of half-cocked i'd be able to get somebody from the list to engage me on these terms to see if I can work them out through dialog.

Basically, i'm looking at "sentences" and "paragraphs" not such much as grammatical entities but as something that i've been calling "Minimum Meaningful Units" to myself. So what I'm saying is that to my way of thinking, at least if this avenue for drawing the distinction pans out, is that in the language arts, composition is in some sense atomic. One can break that down to the word level and say it's all just words in combination, but to my way of thinking I think there are real advantages to differentiating prose and poetry at the level of composition based on different MMUs. The primary advantage is that it gives a writer a framework in which to compose, letting the MMUs function like Legos and trusting that so long as different MMUs are focussed on, the end result is going to be something along the lines of what he's going for. To that end, I think that even prose writers who don't use
paragraphs are working with something similar to the paragraph in terms of their MMUs, whereas even poets who don't appear to be using sentences are still using sentence size MMUs in their composition.

The concept then is that a MMU is the minimum necessary to be written for a piece in one genre or the other to be complete. That is, a poem needs at least one sentence, (the term being used admittedly loosely to mean a subject and something predicated of it), and a prose piece needs at least one paragraph (even more loosely meaning a statement and it's elucidation).

The other thing I like about this approach is that I think it may be possible to conceive of different MMUs that present the opportunity to write pieces that are neither prose nor poetry. One such example might be wittgenstein's "remarks" which are the MMUs of his later philosophy which i've experimented with quite a bit and had some good success with. The results are something that I'm resistant to describe as prose or poetry, but to take the example of the novel, I'm happy to report that a novel which i think we all agree can be either prose or poetry can also be neither prose nor poetry as well

I agree that using "music" in connection with poetry is distracting.  Shall we attempt to replace "musical" with "cadenced" -- (from Webster's "cadence" (n.) #'s 3 & 4 -- "inflection or modulation in tone" -- ""flow of rhythm").

i hate to be a jerk, but isn't "musical" one of those non-descriptive words
masquerading as descriptive?  saying poetry is musical is as meaningless as
calling it "interesting" or "organic".

poetry is (in my mind) all about precision.  musical doesn't do the job.  we
can talk about rhythm, cadence, alliteration, etc.

perhaps i've had too much coffee already.

i can't find my Stevens. i remember the poem for its musical grace and it's philosophical contrast: art/nature.

the level of the paragraph." I think this distinction makes sense
because it relates directly to what people actually do, as well as to

But from my observation - as a reader and a writer of prose and poetry -
novels are composed at the level of the _sentence_, not the paragraph - and
what about people like Jose Saramago or David Albahari, who don't use
paragraphs at all? (As Patrick White said - one of the most illuminating and
helpful things I've ever read about writing novels - a novel is written
sentence by sentence.) You could perhaps make the beginnings of a
distinction here, by saying that - as I believe - poetry is composed in
lines (I don't think poetry has much to do with sentences at all, frankly).
Even if, as in a prose poem, it's a very long line. Or you could say with
Olson that poetry is composed in the syllable and the ear, which might take
care of the flash poetry. I don't think either art is about "the nature of
information" they "convey". Both _are_ something. Yes, they differ, but I've
never read a satisfactory account of what that difference is. Maybe the
crudest is best -there's something encyclopaedic about novels, they amass
detail, while poems discard it.

Elizabeth, I don't understand what you mean - are you saying the decision to
write prose is about a desire for power? What kind of prose do you mean?
What kind of power? There are prose works that equally "vibrate" with the
reader, that are as multiple as any poems. Maybe you're referring to a
particular kind of prose and I am thinking of another. I presume we're
talking about what's generally and perhaps a little depressingly known as
"creative prose".

I've no objection to distinctions. I do however find claims that poetry is
somehow inherently superior to prose (it doesn't seek power, it relinquishes
some kind of control, prose is a vehicle, poetry the passenger, whatever)
irksome. As are claims to the reverse.

All best

Hi.  I would like to inform you, especially those who are not in the U.S.
and may not know or care, that the Writers Guild of America is on strike.

I would also like to encourage some conversation, debate, and support for
the WGA writers.

The Writers Guild is one of the few white collar/artistic labor unions.  Of
the others, while most SAG (Screen Actors Guild) members are respecting the
picket lines, the DGA (Directors Guild) is not.  The Hollywood Teamsters,
and also individual Teamsters, are also not crossing picket lines.

The last writers' strike, which lasted five months, gave rise to reality tv
(which requires fewer, and more easily non-union, writers).  This writers'
strike will take an estimated 1 billion dollars a month from the US
economy.  GE, Sony, Time Warner, etc. -- are diversified and multinational
enough not to care.

The debates are many:

- residuals for online screenings or downloads -- not about napster-esque
stealing and swapping:  the studios are running television shows and feature
films on their own websites without paying the writers residuals.  they are
additionally saying that these are "experiments" for "marketing purposes"
while 1) one cable network runs all of its film programming ad-free and pays
residuals according to contract formulas, 2) part of this marketing is
building share for the network and for the shows, which should be
compensated, 3) we are no longer in the experimental phase of internet
advertising, broadband, etc.

- residuals for the creative offspring of film and tv:  so-called "baby
writers" are exploited by the networks, and regular staff writers are
required, to write webisodes for existing shows for internet-only showings.
neither the creators of the characters, situations -- the show -- nor the
writers of the webisodes are paid residuals.  sometimes, they're not paid
for writing them.

- do not be fooled by studios saying they want to pay residuals to writers,
actors after shows or films make a profit.  studios, now all part of
large corporations, are now able to manipulate the books so that shows
officially never show a profit.  for example, the simpsons, one of the most
popular and longest-running television shows thus far, and one with only
voice actors, is officially still in the red.

- the WGA has been forced to make significant cuts in its union health care
benefit, especially to writers who live outside Los Angeles, and has
extended the number of working years to become fully vested in the health
benefits.

At any one time, less than 5% of the WGA members are working. the average
WGA member makes less money per year from writing than a minor league hockey
player.  [there have been some ravings I've heard about the average salary
being close to what the average first team major league male athlete makes:
not so]

Poets Crag Hill and Geof Huth will give a reading entitled "Sightings &
Hearings" at the Stain Bar in Brooklyn, New York, on November 16th.
Combining their interest in visual, sound, and even textual poetry, they
will read and perform, together and apart, a wide range of works. This will
be the first time Hill and Huth have performed together since their
performance in March of this year, so don't miss this east coast appearance.
If a reading isn't enough encouragement, Stain Bar has a great selection of
New-York-only beer and other drinks.

For me, there can be a shorthand usefulness to the term on a specific
("technical" or "nuts and botls") level....

assonance, alliteration, internal rhymes, so-called 'masculine' and
'feminine' line endings,
rhythmic push and pull, even in the most 'prosey' of poetry, or
poetry conceived of, or operating in a context, or largely on the
page, and not even necessarily uttered verbally, or read silently so
that one feels the poem physically (in the sense of lips, throat, as
much as 'eye' or 'ear')----these can all be considered aspects of the
poem's 'music.'
So even though I'm tempted to conclude that "music" is only an
analogy or metaphor when applied to poetry not literally sung (to, or
with, a lyre or handclap, bongo-esque accompaniment), I don't mind
using that term as a way of considering the feeling (or
connotational) aspects of any piece of writing
(as in "the music of the New York Times Op Ed page," even
but also "Music is feeling, then, not sound" or "unheard sounds are
sweeter," etc).

But, I do think the term "music," like the term "ear," can be (and
often is), oh I'll say, "abused," when applied more generally.
When, for instance, "music" is opposed to "meaning," as it often is.
Some critics speak in terms of a continuum. Music on one side, and
meaning on the other. Poet X Or Poem M is valued as "musical" however
abhorrent, or even lacking, in "meaning" he or she or it is.
Poem N or Poet Y, by contrast, is considered to be much stronger in
terms of "logopiea" ("dance of the intellect," though the word
'dance' alludes to music as well), but weaker in terms of
"melopiea" (I may be spelling these wrong, because of my spell check).
And then somewhere "in between" is the perfect balance, a poem O,
that seems more meaningful because it is more musical, or that seems
more musical because it seems more meaningful.

Yet, when one says one poem is more Musical than another poem, the
term becomes less descriptive and much more subjective and judgmental.
It's one thing to say that one appreciates a certain kind of "music"
over another kind of music, categorically.
It's certainly valid to say "I categorically appreciate opera over
punk music" (or vice versa)
It's another (and in my opinion less valid) thing to say "Opera is
music, punk is not" (or  vice versa)--
Yet I feel this is often how the term "music" (and also the term
"ear"---as in "tin ear") is used in discussions of poetry.
I may not be moved or transported by the 'music' of Auden, Pound or
Robert Duncan as much as I am by Robert Creeley, Laura Riding, or
Pessoa (in Chris Daniels translation at least), for instance,
but I won't therefore make the claim that Auden, Duncan or Pound are
thereby less 'musical' than the others (as is too often done),
and though I tend to generally prefer punk to opera, there's
definitely some opera I prefer to some punk....

Sorry if this seems heavy handed, and not 'musical' enough
(ah, but I can love the music of the essay, letter and manifesto...)
Nor is it intended to sound relativistic.

Chris

In English, if you use the adjective "musial" to talk about text, you
are making a metaphor. My instructors have told me this is not the
case in Classical Chinese or Ancient Greek, a point I'm sure we're
all familiar with (and one I can't really evaluate properly, so I'll
just repeat it as gospel). I say, given that we are put in this
metaphoric corner, let's just embrace it, and mine the entire music-
theory lexicon to what good use we can make of it. If we are talking
technically though, a cadence almost always means a passing from a
state of harmonic or rhythmic tension to one of release. What could
that mean in the context of poetry? Maybe we can even ask that
question in terms of prose (have we figured out what that weird thing
is yet?)

Sorry, questions about music as descriptor of text and vice versa are
my favorite species of question in the world, so I'm just going to
pretend it was the original question. I'm not sure it gets one any
closer to a definition of poetry or prose, but it's really kind of
endless. About 20 messages back, John Cunningham made this great
metaphor out of the introduction of dissonance as the history of both
music and poetry in the 20th century. I'm sure it misses something,
but it seems pretty compelling to follow. What's the notion of
consonance this is relying on? Is Milton consonant, where Eliot is
dissonant? Is it a cognitive category (another place where a music
metaphor dominates- the philosophy of psychology), like we have
resolution to the extent we have cognition, irresolution where we
don't understand? Who are our textual Serialists? (actually, does
anyone know about anyone trying to write a poem based on a tone row?
its seeming very possible to me, sitting here typing on my couch,
which is a sure sign of infallibility)

If we're tossing out "musical", let's please not toss out the
vocabulary of music- it's so much fun.

Also, what exactly would "understood" or "misunderstood" mean in a
discussion about music audiences, to query Jim's definition? Would
*plain song* be what you write when you believe you are going to be
understood, and *lieder*, well you draw your own conclusions?

Bush. Wait...Heliogabalus (or whoever it was really had the Bull...read it
wasn't Heliogabalus but authors like Vonnegut perpetuate that and I fell for
it). You could create one, a suitable neologism: delectalgia? tittilalgia? The
latter one has the additional benefit of sounding "dirty." It is of course
based on "tittilation." I almost crossed wires and put tittivation there  for
some reason. That's one of those words you can't use in ANY circumstance
without sounding hopelessly misbegotten. Should there be a pass(us)-- root for
suffering used instead? German has that great compounding nature so often
praised, so much so I sometimes feel vicariously offended for English. But
Katzensprung is darn cute!  And I love to ask people to wait an  "Augenblick."

I just cheated at this point and asked the Oz Google after failing to  fix on
anything. Someone pointed out the inefficacy of "gloat" to substitute; of
course they are correct. I still suspect there is an obscure polysyllabic that
is a hapax legemonon in Anthony Burgess or someone of that ostentatious ilk. I
 was surprised to learn "schadenfreude" has been used in English since 1922.
I  would have thought it a 19th century importation, although the word fits
the  literary tenor of any time, doubtless, unfortunately, grumblegrumble ahem
mmmble....

Mark, you're right enough that there will always be some degree of boundary
blurring when it comes to categories that weren't created through processes
such as those used in mathematics: I don't particularly desire that things
be black and white.  However, the act of blurring-- of actively increasing
blurriness and reducing differentiation is something worth discussing the
merits of.  I think there have been enough experiments in that direction
(indeed, the prose poem has been an institution for some time now) that the
other direction may hold more space for discovery.  I am primarily coming at
this from the angle of my own writing practice, though I do have to ask why
a writer should have a privileged position when it comes to categorizing
their own work.

I think you may have misunderstood the target of what I was saying about
indefiniteness.  That wasn't related to the main conversation but, rather,
to someone's snarky response to a request I made for them to clarify one of
their arguments.

Subject:      Atticus/Finch presents: Brady/Halpern chapbook and reading!
MIME-Version: 1.0

[Please distribute this post far and wide: small press publishers
depend on your effort to get the word out!]

Dear Friends:

Atticus/Finch is honored to announce the release of our newest
chapbook, Snow Sensitive Skin, a collaborative long-poem by San
Francisco authors Taylor Brady and Rob Halpern. While Atticus/Finch
commissioned this work back in 2005, the collaboration didn't begin in
earnest until June of 2006, in the midst of the (most recent) martial
conflict between Israel and Lebanon. Taking as their point of
departure Lebanese musician and visual artist Mazen Kerbaj's
composition “Starry Night” (see below for a link), an improvisation
between Mazen and the Israeli airforce for “trumpet and bombs,” the
authors challenged themselves to face the violence of war with the
deactivating non-force of the poem, drawing into stark contrast
notions of responsibility, praxis, and the labor of poetry during
times of war. The authors write in their acknowledgements, “if we want
to give ourselves to a present that is something other than the
debased ‘now,’ and to a future that will not have been terminal, every
second language must be taken up as an act of love.” As such, Brady
and Halpern took the very notion of collaboration to task, demanding
that the composition unfold together, in the same room, in real time,
in order to undergo and occupy this second language (in all of its
difficulty) in a present foreign to the terminal ‘now.’

Snow Sensitive Skin is a tour de force in the most literal sense, a
commitment to undertake the difficulty of language as aporia and
possibility, and at 72 pages of tightly weft lines, dedicated to “the
promise of demilitarized time,” this “chapbook” is certainly ambitious
in scope.

If that weren’t enough, folks in and around the San Francisco Bay Area
will have the pleasure of seeing Brady and Halpern read from the book
at its launch this Sunday, November 11th, at Oakland institution New
Yipes (21 Grand, 416 25th Street) at 7pm (along with fellow poet
Garrett Caples), and copies of the book will certainly be on hand for
interested parties.

In the meantime, for those of us happily residing elsewhere, the book
can be purchased now using credit card or check. And, as is the case
with all Atticus/Finch books, this volume will sell out relatively
quickly, so order while you’ve got it on your mind!

To obtain a copy, use your credit card at our website
(www.atticusfinch.org), or send $10 (well-concealed cash, check, or
money order (made payable to Michael Cross)) to:

Atticus/Finch Chapbooks
c/o Michael Cross
State University of New York at Buffalo
Samuel Clemens Hall #306
Buffalo NY 14260-4610


On a related note, we still have a few copies of Patrick Durgin’s
Imitation Poems, if you’d like to bundle your order, and do keep your
eyes open for the next A/F volume (coming this December), Lo, Bittern
by Austin poet C.J. Martin.

And, finally, here’s the link to Kerbaj’s “Starry Night:”

It was Ted Berrigan who first advised me to read Archie Ammons' poetry.  As an interesting poet outside of schools or groups, in the tradition of Williams.  True, Ted, an admirer of Conrad Aiken as well, had justifiably catholic tastes, but that does not mean he was not right about the poetry.

What you both have to say accords at one level what goes on in my own =
writing life.  But writing for oneself, for one's own understanding =
alone, is the fall back position, the limit case. I don't think any of =
us would bother if we didn't think we might extend the size of our =
expected audience, which is to say poetry IS what you write when you =
think you might be understood.Wystan

Elizabeth, all writing has power. It would seem to be a reason to write.
Not all writing has the same power. As to the power of prose, I spoke of =
volume yes, the extent of the cultural space in which the languages of =
prose are the norm and I gave you some examples. Were these bad =
examples?  Try putting poetry where it does not belong, which is almost =
everywhere.  Wystan.

other takes:

poetry is for writing what no one understands when it needs saying anyway.
prose is for saying it poorly.

poetry is what nobody knows what it is except when they don't.

there has to be a joke in a distinction between prose and poetry. not to
dismiss the distinction as laughable but to indicate complication.

if we don't know what poetry is, distinctions between prose and poetry are
going to sound like distinctions between ideals based on hat size or whether
one is wearing plaid.

we don't really know what we're talking about but, then, poetry is the art
of being profoundly vague.

I'm generally with you, Chris, but there is a possible non-biased way to understand how some forms of music might be less "musical" than others--for instance, I would hazard  to say that in country and hip-hop, the presentation of the words, and of the story or persona that those words embody, tends to take precedence, and in that sense they could be called "less musical" than some other forms. If you think Sarah Vaughan is a great singer, you have to have different reasons behind this judgement than you would if you think Johnny Cash is a great singer--in her case, you have to accept some kind of more abstract communication of the musical content of the syllables she is singing, somewhat abstracted from any overt content they might have.

Chris Stroffolino <cstroffo@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  For me, there can be a shorthand usefulness to the term on a specific
("technical" or "nuts and botls") level....

assonance, alliteration, internal rhymes, so-called 'masculine' and
'feminine' line endings,
rhythmic push and pull, even in the most 'prosey' of poetry, or
poetry conceived of, or operating in a context, or largely on the
page, and not even necessarily uttered verbally, or read silently so
that one feels the poem physically (in the sense of lips, throat, as
much as 'eye' or 'ear')----these can all be considered aspects of the
poem's 'music.'
So even though I'm tempted to conclude that "music" is only an
analogy or metaphor when applied to poetry not literally sung (to, or
with, a lyre or handclap, bongo-esque accompaniment), I don't mind
using that term as a way of considering the feeling (or
connotational) aspects of any piece of writing
(as in "the music of the New York Times Op Ed page," even
but also "Music is feeling, then, not sound" or "unheard sounds are
sweeter," etc).

But, I do think the term "music," like the term "ear," can be (and
often is), oh I'll say, "abused," when applied more generally.
When, for instance, "music" is opposed to "meaning," as it often is.
Some critics speak in terms of a continuum. Music on one side, and
meaning on the other. Poet X Or Poem M is valued as "musical" however
abhorrent, or even lacking, in "meaning" he or she or it is.
Poem N or Poet Y, by contrast, is considered to be much stronger in
terms of "logopiea" ("dance of the intellect," though the word
'dance' alludes to music as well), but weaker in terms of
"melopiea" (I may be spelling these wrong, because of my spell check).
And then somewhere "in between" is the perfect balance, a poem O,
that seems more meaningful because it is more musical, or that seems
more musical because it seems more meaningful.

Yet, when one says one poem is more Musical than another poem, the
term becomes less descriptive and much more subjective and judgmental.
It's one thing to say that one appreciates a certain kind of "music"
over another kind of music, categorically.
It's certainly valid to say "I categorically appreciate opera over
punk music" (or vice versa)
It's another (and in my opinion less valid) thing to say "Opera is
music, punk is not" (or vice versa)--
Yet I feel this is often how the term "music" (and also the term
"ear"---as in "tin ear") is used in discussions of poetry.
I may not be moved or transported by the 'music' of Auden, Pound or
Robert Duncan as much as I am by Robert Creeley, Laura Riding, or
Pessoa (in Chris Daniels translation at least), for instance,
but I won't therefore make the claim that Auden, Duncan or Pound are
thereby less 'musical' than the others (as is too often done),
and though I tend to generally prefer punk to opera, there's
definitely some opera I prefer to some punk....

Sorry if this seems heavy handed, and not 'musical' enough
(ah, but I can love the music of the essay, letter and manifesto...)
Nor is it intended to sound relativistic.

Chris

Hal's got it pretty close. German makes words by yoking two words
together without a space in between. There's no way that English can
replicate this, and no reason it should. How about a one-word
translation of gesamtkunstwerk or weltschmerz? Fortunately we get to

Hi and thanks for the information yet not certain
how to support substantively except that the poets
might consider striking. I wonder how long it would
take for that news to hit the stands?

Hi.  I would like to inform you, especially those who are not in the
 U.S.
and may not know or care, that the Writers Guild of America is on
 strike.

I would also like to encourage some conversation, debate, and support
 for
the WGA writers.

The Writers Guild is one of the few white collar/artistic labor unions.
  Of
the others, while most SAG (Screen Actors Guild) members are respecting
 the
picket lines, the DGA (Directors Guild) is not.  The Hollywood
 Teamsters,
and also individual Teamsters, are also not crossing picket lines.

The last writers' strike, which lasted five months, gave rise to
 reality tv
(which requires fewer, and more easily non-union, writers).  This
 writers'
strike will take an estimated 1 billion dollars a month from the US
economy.  GE, Sony, Time Warner, etc. -- are diversified and
 multinational
enough not to care.

The debates are many:

- residuals for online screenings or downloads -- not about
 napster-esque
stealing and swapping:  the studios are running television shows and
 feature
films on their own websites without paying the writers residuals.  they
 are
additionally saying that these are "experiments" for "marketing
 purposes"
while 1) one cable network runs all of its film programming ad-free and
 pays
residuals according to contract formulas, 2) part of this marketing is
building share for the network and for the shows, which should be
compensated, 3) we are no longer in the experimental phase of internet
advertising, broadband, etc.

- residuals for the creative offspring of film and tv:  so-called "baby
writers" are exploited by the networks, and regular staff writers are
required, to write webisodes for existing shows for internet-only
 showings.
neither the creators of the characters, situations -- the show -- nor
 the
writers of the webisodes are paid residuals.  sometimes, they're not
 paid
for writing them.

- do not be fooled by studios saying they want to pay residuals to
 writers,
actors after shows or films make a profit.  studios, now all part of
large corporations, are now able to manipulate the books so that shows
officially never show a profit.  for example, the simpsons, one of the
 most
popular and longest-running television shows thus far, and one with
 only
voice actors, is officially still in the red.

- the WGA has been forced to make significant cuts in its union health
 care
benefit, especially to writers who live outside Los Angeles, and has
extended the number of working years to become fully vested in the
 health
benefits.

At any one time, less than 5% of the WGA members are working. the
 average
WGA member makes less money per year from writing than a minor league
 hockey
player.  [there have been some ravings I've heard about the average
 salary
being close to what the average first team major league male athlete
 makes:
not so]

All best,

I only know one poet who gets paid, and it isn't for writing, it is for
teaching.

Chris,

Thanks for making a lucid argument about musicality, etc.  You've got it
exactly correct--it is the abuse and the shorthand of so many terms applied
to poetry that get my goat.

It is pretty unclear now, especially as it is only day 3.  My husband went
to his strike line, at CBS Radford, at 5 a.m., to block deliveries. He says
they are not sure if they should be encouraging a boycott of GE, say, or
Sony, or even of Universal Studios or the Disney parks or Time Warner
cable.  Our GE dishwasher is broken, and they are coming out to fix it for
the second time in a month.  During the last SAG strike, I worked at the
fire station on the Universal lot on an emergency notification system (as a
contractor).   It is not even clear if WGA can articulate to the public what
should be boycotted -- (non-scripted, foreign, scab-written) replacement
programming -- especially since already-written programming and film should
not be boycotted, and since sports writers are not covered by the union and
I believe PBS shows and news are in a grey area.

Of course, it is really important not to write or revise a tv show, movie,
or webisode, or even write jokes for a talk show host or news anchor for a
major studio or network while the union is on strike.  So, poets, if Disney
gives you a ring, says they need a few over the shoulder (or tail) lines for
a talking dog movie, say no.  Uh, and don't appear on that O'Reilly show or
watch reality tv.  Or maybe this is a great time to appear on the O'Reilly
show if he doesn't do his own writing.

all best,
Catherine

structure, too: as i'm usually posting on the run, i wrote: isn't poetry more musical? poets count. i should have left out counting as it suggest that one is using a metronome, counting accents. perhaps i was thinking of Borges when i mentioned the musical quality of poetry. Borges, in "The Craft of Poetry," makes a larger claim. he considers all art as aspiring to music/where there's no separation of form & content. in a lyric poem, i find that a good opening line seems to dictate the nature of the poem. when writing a play (i've attempted a few), i seem to intuitively sense an overall sense of the works structure. i doubt that most creative work is the result of as much linguistic hairsplitting as some the comments i've read suggest.

assonance, alliteration, internal rhymes, so-called 'masculine' and
'feminine' line endings,
rhythmic push and pull, even in the most 'prosey' of poetry, or
poetry conceived of, or operating in a context, or largely on the
page, and not even necessarily uttered verbally, or read silently so
that one feels the poem physically (in the sense of lips, throat, as
much as 'eye' or 'ear')----these can all be considered aspects of the
poem's 'music.'
So even though I'm tempted to conclude that "music" is only an
analogy or metaphor when applied to poetry not literally sung (to, or
with, a lyre or handclap, bongo-esque accompaniment), I don't mind
using that term as a way of considering the feeling (or
connotational) aspects of any piece of writing
(as in "the music of the New York Times Op Ed page," even
but also "Music is feeling, then, not sound" or "unheard sounds are
sweeter," etc).

But, I do think the term "music," like the term "ear," can be (and
often is), oh I'll say, "abused," when applied more generally.
When, for instance, "music" is opposed to "meaning," as it often is.
Some critics speak in terms of a continuum. Music on one side, and
meaning on the other. Poet X Or Poem M is valued as "musical" however
abhorrent, or even lacking, in "meaning" he or she or it is.
Poem N or Poet Y, by contrast, is considered to be much stronger in
terms of "logopiea" ("dance of the intellect," though the word
'dance' alludes to music as well), but weaker in terms of
"melopiea" (I may be spelling these wrong, because of my spell check).
And then somewhere "in between" is the perfect balance, a poem O,
that seems more meaningful because it is more musical, or that seems
more musical because it seems more meaningful.

Yet, when one says one poem is more Musical than another poem, the
term becomes less descriptive and much more subjective and judgmental.
It's one thing to say that one appreciates a certain kind of "music"
over another kind of music, categorically.
It's certainly valid to say "I categorically appreciate opera over
punk music" (or vice versa)
It's another (and in my opinion less valid) thing to say "Opera is
music, punk is not" (or vice versa)--
Yet I feel this is often how the term "music" (and also the term
"ear"---as in "tin ear") is used in discussions of poetry.
I may not be moved or transported by the 'music' of Auden, Pound or
Robert Duncan as much as I am by Robert Creeley, Laura Riding, or
Pessoa (in Chris Daniels translation at least), for instance,
but I won't therefore make the claim that Auden, Duncan or Pound are
thereby less 'musical' than the others (as is too often done),
and though I tend to generally prefer punk to opera, there's
definitely some opera I prefer to some punk....

Sorry if this seems heavy handed, and not 'musical' enough
(ah, but I can love the music of the essay, letter and manifesto...)
Nor is it intended to sound relativistic.

i like the privileged position point. Derrida attracted me mainly because the guy could write. unfortunately, it's hard to say ditto for many of his followers ( pretty much everything i've been reading so far has been, thankfully, in English.). some of the deconstruction stuff i've read has made me think of a local commercial for Country Music, to wit: Music i can hum, lyrics i can understand.

this from the angle of my own writing practice, though I do have to ask why
a writer should have a privileged position when it comes to categorizing
their own work.

I think you may have misunderstood the target of what I was saying about

to someone's snarky response to a request I made for them to clarify one of
their arguments.

Barry, this is interesting, but I think your examples actually prove
my point.
Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

Mark=97I like and agree with what you say here but I'm setting this up =20=

Wystan, that "all writing has power" is not relevant here.  Power means
different things, and I was trying to figure out what you meant.  Your
examples were fine, I suppose, but I still (I repeat) don't see how the
greater volume of prose is a recommendation for further blurring the
division between prose and poetry

"Try putting poetry where it does not belong, which is almost everywhere."
I don't find that to be true. If you do, perhaps you're not trying hard
enough.  And, really, you have a bit of a problem here since, in order to
put poetry in a place where it seems not to belong, you must know that what
you are putting there is, in fact, poetry, which would seem to call for a
stronger differentiation, not a weaker one.

In truth, I agree. In fact I would be more likely to cite Cash as an example of what I call musicality than Sarah Vaughan--because he gives it in something like a purer state. (To advert to an earlier discussion, this is somehow related to my feeling that there is as much torque in poem by Philip Larkin as in one by any given Language poet.) And yet, and yet...as genres, jazz still seems more "musical" to me than country, the reason being somehow tied to the fact that if, in a certain song, Cash felt the need to do something like scat singing, to push his interpretation into some more abstract area--if he could even have conceived of that, wouldn't his producer have yelled "cut!" or his backup musicians not understood how to follow him? There seems to be a different kind of constraint in this genre on how an artist could express his musicality. What do you think?

  Another word I have a somewhat confused, "know it when I see it but can't define it" adhesion is radicality.

  But these days, I take as my touchstones for radicality almost any solo recording by Art Tatum, or Richard Hell's singing on his early records.

Chris Stroffolino <cstroffo@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:
  Barry, this is interesting, but I think your examples actually prove
my point.
Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

(Johnny is musical, but the music he sings isn't particularly--does that make any sense?)

Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

The book-length poem "Glare" was my first exposure to Ammons. I was
surprised at the amount of humor in that work, and the amount of
elegant formal solutions he employed in poem's writing. Going back to
earlier books, I was surprised at the amount of nature imagery in the
work. Tape for the Turn of the Year is a favorite, but other wonderful
poems are scattered throughout his life's work. He was strongly
impacted by Ashbery, especially later in life.

When i was a kid in fifth grade the difference between prose and poetry
seemed to be one of counting.
In poetry, one counted--syllables, meters, stresses, beats, numbers of
lines, patterns of numbers of lines, patterns of which numbered lines
rhymed, what types of poems go with which numbers of this or that
combination of these.

Even in "free verse" there were forms of counting that could be applied.

The purpose of the various calculations--it seemed then--was to arrange
words in such combinations as to create the maximum effect with the minimum
of language.  Each particle of the poem had to have a highly charged energy
brought into a direction of movement that is organized in terms of the
arrangements of the elements. (The elements being sounds, rhythms,
assonances, dissonances, alliterations, shiftings of syllables within words
for interior rhymes, spacings of words and lines, the uses of allusion,
onomatopoia, etc. etc.)

In a poem it seemed the particles are pushed to the foreground, to a
surface.  The poems I liked were the ones that left the surface, or dove
below, where the effect is created not by the visible counted elements, but
an invisible charge that happens in in-between among the combining and
arranging of elements and makes a quantum or alchemical leap.

The in-between is like a "beat we in"--a musical beat in which the tones an=
d
reverberations of the sounds go beyond the "notes."

In prose, something mysterious occurs, because there is no counting.
Effects are achieved through the working with fragments.  Prose isn't built
on a sentence or paragraph anymore than a poem is, not in the way these are
claustrophobically and captivally categorized as, at any rate.   In
Faulkner's As I Lie Dying, for example, a whole chapter is this fragment:
"My mother is a fish."  In Roberto Bolano's By Night in Chile, or the later
Henry James and the works of Javier Marias, a "sentence" may last for a few
pages.  The alluvial accumulation of clauses, fragments,  brings about a
different form of breathing in the articulation, as in Olson's sense of the
breath in articulating a poem.  The accretion of fragments creates an
architectonic musical form.  Yet since it is made of fragments, it is not
organized --or heard--in the same minute precisions as a poem. It pulses an=
d
flows with varying speeds and spaces of time. A different form of listening
is involved, yet al the same one not so far removed from poetry that one
can't find a shell on the shore of either and not hear the ocean of the
other.

In reading prose, one hears differing musics than in poetry--the beat is pu=
t
together in a different way--because one is not as tied to the counting
aspect.  The tensions and speeds shift with a different structure, which ca=
n
be made of fragments of many elements at once--the scenic aspect, the
anti-/narrative direction, character, descriptive fragment--.more like a
movie--

I tend to read everything as a form of particle, and then a fragment,
starting with the simple existence of a mark on a page--or anything off the
page also--but with the written in the Roman alphabet, the letter for
starters, and a sound--fragments are the extensions of these that first com=
e
along--one may read any single letter, a syllable, a word, in such a variet=
y
of registers and tones, with suggestions of so many reverberating
sounds--let alone meanings--echoes--that the study of any stretch of writin=
g
can be found opening into a myriad directions of writing.

"A poem to be a poem has to have a direction," Williams wrote--and the same
can be said for any form of writing that involves the life of the senses.

Perhaps one of the reasons for the kinds of opacity that readers of poetry
can demonstrate towards prose and vice versa--is that it is just that, the
reader, who makes these distinctions and finds these "blanks and ruins" in
the writing less preferable to them.  The writing itself is working at a
very high  level when good, it is that the effects that are being sought
differ in the means used to attain their arrival.

It is also a matter of taste based on specialization.  The poet perhaps
thinks that the technical aspects of poetry make it more "complex" than
prose.  The prose writer claims to face problems no poet ever does.  One ca=
n
be blind, deaf to the other.  A kind of alienation can set in. The other's
specialized form is like a country which one has lost any interest in other
than as a kind of exercise in the travel of forebearance.

Yet at the particle, the fragment--at this level--the dance and song,
musics, the visibles and invisibles, the odors and tastes--all are
possibility--and so in writing and reading with these--to expand, extend th=
e
awarenesses found along the way.

That the technical aspect alone is not the key is proven by a myriad works.
Cocteau noted that the cinema records death at work.  Writing is a way that
essays to work with time in such a manner that even working with words that
disintegrate, go out of use, fade away as unheard sounds,  ("dead
languages"), the notations of the sensual apprehension of existence endure,
continue obdurately signalling, from "remote pasts and remote futures".
The petroglyphs and cave paintings, a myriad fragments of notations found
worldwide, indicate this presence of writing even in the absence of
"meanings" or "sounds"--the visual activity of the signs begins to trigger =
a
response--movements, sounds, the finding from particles and fragments the
energy and direction of poetry & prose.

Rather than privilege one over the other--it seems more interesting that
there may be many many already found and many more as yet to find--of any
kind of writing--making use of the evidences existing--and those their
energies and directions may be moving towards--ever as yet unknown--yet whe=
n
found having a form of uncanny recognition--

That is in part why I do the works with paint and rubBEings with found
fragments and particles in the physical world--to give a sense that what
there is existing in poetry and prose is ever indicating that which is
hidden in plain site/sight/cite--

I don't know why we seem to be compelled to try to determine whether country
or jazz is more musical. And why Cash when Bill Monroe and bluegrass is a
much earthier example as are Flatts & Scruggs. And don't forget, country
uses the yodel which would be a rough equivalent of scat. But then we have
the Tuva throat singers, the Tibetan chants, the throat singing of the Dene
and other northern aboriginal groups. What I'm getting at in my roundabout
way is that each music has its own aesthetics which are beyond comparison.
As is the music in poetry. It doesn't make any sense to say that Elliot is
more musical than Williams or Jorie Graham (whom I have just discovered and
whose voice - and, yes, musicality - I find incredible). The musicality is,
to me, one of the defining factors which makes poetry different than prose.
The other dimension we seem to be ignoring is that of the plastic arts. To
me, poetry is a fusion of music and painting. If I were to design a
Cartesian coordinate system for poetry, I'd have the X axis labelled 'music'
and have it stretching from complete assonance to complete dissonance, and
have the Y axis labelled 'painting' and have it stretching from complete
realism to complete abstract (whatever that might mean) (NB: I would subsume
in 'painting' the concept of sculpture as well as it seems to me,
particularly with Jorie Graham, that it is more the concept of sculpture
(which she comes by honestly through her mother who is a world-renowned
sculptress) that has influenced and dictated her work particularly with the
long line). Again, to me, it is the fusion aspect that shifts the balance
away from prose and towards poetry.

Subject: Re: "musical" as descriptive of poetry

In truth, I agree. In fact I would be more likely to cite Cash as an example
of what I call musicality than Sarah Vaughan--because he gives it in
something like a purer state. (To advert to an earlier discussion, this is
somehow related to my feeling that there is as much torque in poem by Philip
Larkin as in one by any given Language poet.) And yet, and yet...as genres,
jazz still seems more "musical" to me than country, the reason being somehow
tied to the fact that if, in a certain song, Cash felt the need to do
something like scat singing, to push his interpretation into some more
abstract area--if he could even have conceived of that, wouldn't his
producer have yelled "cut!" or his backup musicians not understood how to
follow him? There seems to be a different kind of constraint in this genre
on how an artist could express his musicality. What do you think?

  Another word I have a somewhat confused, "know it when I see it but can't
define it" adhesion is radicality.

  But these days, I take as my touchstones for radicality almost any solo
recording by Art Tatum, or Richard Hell's singing on his early records.

Chris Stroffolino <cstroffo@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:
  Barry, this is interesting, but I think your examples actually prove
my point.
Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

I agree. I don't think insulting Pierre is going to change anyone's mind
about Bly or the origins of Deep Image. Besides who would be envious of a
"self-indulgent shit" who writes about egotistical sublimity.

Apologies if I misunderstood you, Elizabeth. Still, I have some empathy for
Wystan's idea that all writing has power (and if it doesn't, what are we
doing?) I guess it all depends on what you mean by power.  - Btw, Wystan, I
_like_ putting poetry where it doesn't belong. I've found that as soon as
you do, it starts belonging.

I'm not sure that the "expected audience" definition really holds water,
though of course it's indisputable that the literary market is dominated by
prose. But a lot of the prose I find most interesting won't sell much more
than poetry might. Print runs of 1000 or so are more common than not. I read
somewhere that a best-selling literary novel in the UK means around 10,000
copies, which isn't exactly huge. It's only at one end that prose is
dominant, and that's generally a certain kind of prose - story-driven,
character-based, often generic (I don't mean those as pejorative terms, btw,
like all conventions it's all about what you do with them).

Jason, your MMUs make me think rather mischievously of Humpty Dumpty's story
in Alice in Wonderland - "Once there was a boater". Or Baldrick's novel in
Blackadder - "Once were there was a lovely little sausage named Baldrick".
Perhaps they're poems?

All best

My husband was a playwright.  He had to find work, of course.  Not that he
doesn't still write experimental plays and fiction.  Not that he loves the
movies he's been able to see through the process.  But hey, Suzan
Lori-Parks:  Girl 6.  Need I say more?  He got a job leveraging his
knowledge of form and dialog and character development that will last until
he allows his grey hair to show.  His union covers health insurance, which
we need.  Part of what he had to do was 1) move from New York where his
then-partner -- me -- had a six figure career, 2) spend his life savings, 3)
take a "class" at a studio.  The studio charged him money for this "class"
(even though he has two advanced degrees, productions, etc.) so that they
could hire him below scale after the class.

But something else is going on with the webisodes:  our government, in its
infinite wisdom, gave certain rights to creative material "created for" to
the studios, as though they were, say, marketing brochures, rather than,
say, characters.  So then, there's this erosion of rights to writing.

This is essentially like the word processing job (another field that I think
should be unionised) I had once; even though I had degrees, five years of
wp, etc. behind me, I had to work for free for two weeks as "training." It
chansed off my other part time jobs, and made me dependent on a single one.
So I guess, if your friends want to break into a business that, on
average, doesn't pay a living wage, takes the rights to your work, fires you
when you're 50, and -- without a union -- doesn't give you health insurance,
pension, or other benefits...

Our current house was owned from 1941 until about 1989 by a family headed by
a former musician and orchestra manager -- I think he was associated with
Tito Puente and many others.  I think the story is that he would not let the
orchestra have uncompensated practice outside of union-controlled locations
& time-frames -- during that strike.  Anyways, he was never a musician or
orchestra manager again, and sold golf equipment for the rest of his life.

Before that it was owned by the head of the west coast for Western
Electric.  During WWII he was promoted from movies to... defense
contracting....

They have just fired the production staffs.  Those will no longer be
salaried positions.  If the last strike gave us reality tv, because it is
largely unacted and unwritten, how can studio motivation this time be toward
more risk? Part of the strike is to try to help break the monopoly six
conglomerates have over creative content.  Monopoly = no risk.  Companies
tend toward monopoly.

Universal = NBC = GE.  What does general electric make?

GE requires Universal to interview 6 off-shore engineers for each open
engineering position.  Even when the position requires native-speaker
English language skills.  I know; I wrote about their proprietary residuals
system the last time I worked for them (no one was on strike).  As a
consultant.  The engineers who didn't need English skills were brought onto
the lot in on a bus everyday from the corporate dorm they were housed in.

Chris Stroffolino's points her here on poetries, vocals and musics makes me want to reference last week's great SF State Poetry Center's celebration (at the Unitarian Church) for A HELEN ADAM READER,  Edited with Notes and an Introduction by Kristin Prevallet (National Poetry Foundation - includes a CD of Adam performing). 491 pages, $29.95 - a steal!.
 Adam's work, solely ballads, is by definition 'musical' - and can only be interpreted and performed as such.  But what a wild  'noir' filled  night  of  primarily poet performers variously taking/flying off on the works in ways that I even suspect Helen at her most demonic extreme would have tilted her head in astonishment. Performances included Chris singing and beating the tarnation out of the church piano (when is some institution going to hire this guy and take advantage of the span of knowledge and passion for music and poesie from Lizziebethan to hip-hop-punk and blues??), the fiddle of Pat Reed, David Buuk with another blazing piano and voice on 'San Francisco's Burning', plus wonderful vocals from Kristin Prevallet and, wonderfully moon drenched voice of Roxie Hamilton (with her pickup band) doing her Appalachian ballad interps of Adam, and then 'straight' readings by Michael McClure and Kevin Killian, who, wistfully, suggested that maybe it was Helen who was Lou
 Reed and Nico's dark muse back there in the seventie's heroin daze when she became something of a performing presence in NY City.  Then there was  Warner Jepson, the original composer and performer for the San Francisco six month run  of  'San Francisco Burning'. When the play moved to New York - in the early sixties - in what turned out to be a brief run at the Judson Poets Theater (name?), Helen insisted on new compositions and forbid him to ever publicly perform the music again (a little bit of a control freak she!) Warner happily played the music again, and probably would have played all night. Ironically it sounded quite old fashioned Broadway musical.  David Buuk's closing performance poured and lit the gas on all of that. (Apologies to some other great performances by other folks that took the stage, too).

 Quite amazing, it was, to be there. With a good thanks to Kristin Prevallet who managed to organize the whole evening from afar.

Chris Stroffolino <cstroffo@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote: Barry, this is interesting, but I think your examples actually prove
my point.
Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

what about poetry that works against 'musicality' and phonographic
techniques of rhyme, metre, etc?
surely not all poetry can be described as musical, ie concrete
poetry, some sound poetry, some digital poetries, etc?

Picking up on Hal's translation, how 'bout that mix of malicious fraud, greed and glee as say after - in that eye ball to eye ball moment - when Cheney and Bush give each other a quick kiss goodnight. Now that's cold. That's 'schadenfreude.'

In poetry, like all arts, we are continually redefining our values, our
notions of craft, technique, prosody. We search to locate the bridges =
that
can transport us from the recognizable to the unknown. Enter Robert
Mittenthal's new work Value Unmapped. In these compellingly beautiful =
poems,
shards of text shimmer on the surface of what's well-made and what's =
made
unattainable, unmapped:  "Half a person please/A freeze frame from the
temporary." These poems remind us that the political is mapped onto the
formal. These poems are written for the future. Robert Fitterman

In Value Unmapped sublime laments paradoxically remind us to both =
scrutinize
and celebrate the blessed predicament of modernity. Mittenthal sharply
reveals how "Beauty is to touch the broken with all sensation." This =
clever,
comic, urgent work should be read often and kept within arm's reach for
stirring commentary as we enter and navigate "futures or false dystopias =
of
pure connection." Laynie Browne

When you write/draw/program/paint/perform/whatever a poem that people
respond well to, sometimes it's because it has somehow engaged them
creatively; there may indeed be material to understand in the poem, and that
may be part of the other person's interest in it, but who on earth reads
poetry simply to understand what the poet is saying? I think many read it to
be engaged creatively in what they can make of it.

Poetry is always already interactive. Is it a jig-saw or can it be put
together more ways than one? Jig-saws are prose. Poetry is a much more
interesting construction.

One that doesn't simply seek to be 'understood' but to engage the reader
creatively, let them bring their whole wealth of knowledge and experience to
an active construction of meaning, meaning which may ultimately be of their
own making.

Yes, of course, but it only becomes interesting to compare things when they are beyond comparison. Comparing comparables is a trivial activity.

  As an outsider to both, I take bluegrass and country to be different categories.

John Cunningham <johncunningham366@MTS.NET> wrote:
  I don't know why we seem to be compelled to try to determine whether country
or jazz is more musical. And why Cash when Bill Monroe and bluegrass is a
much earthier example as are Flatts & Scruggs. And don't forget, country
uses the yodel which would be a rough equivalent of scat. But then we have
the Tuva throat singers, the Tibetan chants, the throat singing of the Dene
and other northern aboriginal groups. What I'm getting at in my roundabout
way is that each music has its own aesthetics which are beyond comparison.
As is the music in poetry. It doesn't make any sense to say that Elliot is
more musical than Williams or Jorie Graham (whom I have just discovered and
whose voice - and, yes, musicality - I find incredible). The musicality is,
to me, one of the defining factors which makes poetry different than prose.
The other dimension we seem to be ignoring is that of the plastic arts. To
me, poetry is a fusion of music and painting. If I were to design a
Cartesian coordinate system for poetry, I'd have the X axis labelled 'music'
and have it stretching from complete assonance to complete dissonance, and
have the Y axis labelled 'painting' and have it stretching from complete
realism to complete abstract (whatever that might mean) (NB: I would subsume
in 'painting' the concept of sculpture as well as it seems to me,
particularly with Jorie Graham, that it is more the concept of sculpture
(which she comes by honestly through her mother who is a world-renowned
sculptress) that has influenced and dictated her work particularly with the
long line). Again, to me, it is the fusion aspect that shifts the balance
away from prose and towards poetry.

Subject: Re: "musical" as descriptive of poetry

In truth, I agree. In fact I would be more likely to cite Cash as an example
of what I call musicality than Sarah Vaughan--because he gives it in
something like a purer state. (To advert to an earlier discussion, this is
somehow related to my feeling that there is as much torque in poem by Philip
Larkin as in one by any given Language poet.) And yet, and yet...as genres,
jazz still seems more "musical" to me than country, the reason being somehow
tied to the fact that if, in a certain song, Cash felt the need to do
something like scat singing, to push his interpretation into some more
abstract area--if he could even have conceived of that, wouldn't his
producer have yelled "cut!" or his backup musicians not understood how to
follow him? There seems to be a different kind of constraint in this genre
on how an artist could express his musicality. What do you think?

Another word I have a somewhat confused, "know it when I see it but can't
define it" adhesion is radicality.

But these days, I take as my touchstones for radicality almost any solo
recording by Art Tatum, or Richard Hell's singing on his early records.

Chris Stroffolino wrote:
Barry, this is interesting, but I think your examples actually prove
my point.
Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

I never insulted anyone. And if you red what I wrote, you will not find that I say anything to support Bly. I don't support him; I don't even read him. Nor do I care enough about the notion of Deep Image to want to change anyone's mind about it (other than making sure that people don't mix Ammons up with it). I am interested in changing people's minds about the best ways to articulate one's opposition to the poetry one doesn't like. Exposing one's mere resentment like that is a weak and dsiappointing way of doing it--all the more so when one really could be arguing against one's opponent on principle. I hold Pierre's contribution to our letters to be of considerable importance--not something I would have said of Bly, despite the fact that his magazine was significant in its day for keeping US poetry open to foreign influennes.

"This extraordinary, library-in-one-volume: what a resource! Those to =
whom poetry is essential as the supreme use of language will find the =
work of many poets they have never before come to, and those readers who =
have limited themselves to prose have the opportunity to discover how =
the poet outreaches everything prose can illuminate in who and what we =
are, no matter where, on the map. Nine thematic groupings of the work =
bring us wonderfully, almost perilously close to ultimate experience in =
childhood, love, war, exile, the inextricable relations between politics =
and the personal, the tragic and the ironic, the wisdom in sorrow and =
humor, that only the most intense imagination can plumb. That of the =
poet. The realm of imagination is one. This anthology gives entry to its =
vast expression in the Middle East and Asia, including the changing =
sensibilities of poets in the ever-growing world of immigration. =
Assembled here not the Tower of Babel, but the astonishment and subtlety =
inherent in many languages and their experimental modes to expand the =
power of words. The introductions to each section offer perceptions =
engagingly, against which to place one's own readings. The editors have =
boldly envisaged and compiled a beautiful achievement for world =
literature."     =20

for anyone seriously interested in investigating Deep Image, Ben Bedard was generous enough to send the following info to me a few weeks back on the foundational statements re Deep Image:

"The first mentions  of Deep Image occur in J.Rothenberg's little mag (literally), Poems from the Floating Earth--look especially at Volume 3, whose title is:  Deep Image: Ancient and Modern.  Somewhere in this series, JR has an essay entitled "the Deep Image is the Threatened Image".  Once you're done with that, turn to Trobar, issue 2, for Robert Kelly's essay, "Notes on the Deep Image."  Later in the Trobar series, where I'm not sure, J. Rothenberg has another essay, "Why Deep Image?".  These are the testaments to Deep Image that I'm aware of.  Also, be sure to check out R. Kelly's poem "Sun of the Center" in Trobar 2 for the Deep Image in praxis."

Mike Basinski also pointed out a feature on Deep Image in issue of George Dowden's mimeo mag Eleventh Finger.

We all know that Lit is a parasitical endeavor. Still, I read Rothenburg's "Technicians of the Sacred" some years back, and have recently reopened it.  He seems to have at least as strong a sense of world Lit as Bly, and he's less facile ( he isn't facile.). Bly seems to deliver Epiphanies that seem somewhat deep upon first blush, but don't hold when given a reasonable amount of scrutiny. Merwin, as far as I know, didn't get involved in any of this. He began as a rather conventional formalist, but soon developed a surreal signature style. He's done his homework. He's a prolific translator. His "The Folding Cliffs" is a genuine epic. His prose/poems have recently been collected. Whether one cares for his work or not, I don't see how anyone would fail to see that the guy is a major poet. & apart from all of that, he's worked outside the university.
  I defend Merwin. Send Bly to the guillotine.


Barry Schwabsky <b.schwabsky@BTOPENWORLD.COM> wrote:  I never insulted anyone. And if you red what I wrote, you will not find that I say anything to support Bly. I don't support him; I don't even read him. Nor do I care enough about the notion of Deep Image to want to change anyone's mind about it (other than making sure that people don't mix Ammons up with it). I am interested in changing people's minds about the best ways to articulate one's opposition to the poetry one doesn't like. Exposing one's mere resentment like that is a weak and dsiappointing way of doing it--all the more so when one really could be arguing against one's opponent on principle. I hold Pierre's contribution to our letters to be of considerable importance--not something I would have said of Bly, despite the fact that his magazine was significant in its day for keeping US poetry open to foreign influennes.

Adam Morey wrote: I agree. I don't think insulting Pierre is going to change anyone's mind

As for poetry being more "musical" than, say, prose, this makes more than a certain amount of sense.  Even, oddly enough when considering prose poetry or poetry which uses prose rhythms in the mix.  I think this is borne out by the fact that it is much easier to listen to poetry read out loud, even longish poems and prose poems, than it is to listen to prose fiction read out loud by its authors.  Of course, being a poet, I have a prejudice in favor of poetry.  But I've noticed over many years how difficult it is to listen to and to perform readings of prose fiction compared to the performance of poetry.  This may not directly indicate the "musicality" of poetry in any easily explicable, logical way.  But I believe it does so, anyway, since the easiest thing to listen to performed is, of course, music itself.

Yes, Sarah Vaughan, when she's singing phonemes or 'scat' might play
her vocal instrument much more like Charlie Parker than Cash does,
But there are many levels of communication (even on a strictly vocal
level) in Cash "abstracted from any overt content" as well.
The "abstract" might be more obvious in Vaughan, because on first
listen the listener may not be as "distracted" by the alleged "overt
content"
as they could be in Johnny Cash, but the more one listens to Cash,
the more one can hear how the delivery (even if his vocal palatte
may not be as "virtuoso" by certain standards), even on a strictly
vocal level, is not a mere transparent conveying of the story or
persona.

Of course, it's hard to abstract the mere vocal elements of either
Cash or Vaughan (or of hip hop and country or vocal-jazz in general)
from the
other instruments. Even if one could make the claim that Cash's voice
is "less musical" than Vaughan's (which I'm not willing to claim), it
would
be even harder to claim that Cash's sound (with The Tennessee Two or
Three) is "less musical." there's that flat top box that gets rhythm
while it gets the blues (even the words of those early hits of his
point away from the 'persona' or 'story').
Likewise, I think if you asked many people in hip-hop, it's about the
beats as much as the words and the voice.
And "beats" (in hip hop parlance) is also texture, and to some extent
melody, as much as rhythm.
One could argue that country and rhythm and blues (both generally
from the U.S. southland) emphasized immediacy of rhythmic backbeat,
but we may all have our preferred styles, but I still don't see how
one is less "musical" than the other.

Cecil Taylor/Ornette Coleman are perfect background for Kathy Acker. No one's mentioned Irish folk music. Or maybe they have & i missed it.  I wonder if Scottish ballads & tradional music had an influence on Stevenson. I wonder if Seamus Heaney digs Sinnead O Conner, or does he stick to traditional. The Carter family did some beautiful stuff. Will miss Cash. A volume of prison poetry should be dedicated to Johnn;y C.

I think Gerald is referring more to Taylor's organizational techniques than
to the dissonance of Taylor's result. Taylor's work has informed much of my
writing, and Taylor himself is a very interesting poet.

Cecil Taylor/Ornette Coleman are perfect background for Kathy Acker. No
one's mentioned Irish folk music. Or maybe they have & i missed it.  I
wonder if Scottish ballads & tradional music had an influence on Stevenson.
I wonder if Seamus Heaney digs Sinnead O Conner, or does he stick to
traditional. The Carter family did some beautiful stuff. Will miss Cash. A
volume of prison poetry should be dedicated to Johnn;y C.

s with exact measurements. Joyce, I think, plays music on several occasions=
 in Ulysses, and furthermore in the Wake. No doubt.=20

If you're coming from the standpoint of traditional notation, e.g. 4/4, 3/4=
, 12/3, etc., then you totally miss the point of 'inherent' musicality, whi=
ch is individual. I suggest folks go to www.last.fm and check out musics in=
fulenced by p16.d4, the hafler trio, phillip jeck, s.b.o.t.h.i., etc. etc...

this will give you a better grasp of musicality, and hopefully prevent you =
from making the mistake that things can be 'more' musical than other things=
.=20

Not 'how' musical is it but 'how is it musical'.

right oh but lots of sound poetry is musical by the nature of the sounds
they produce ursonata for example
and in some cases i.e. me natural rhythms from improving with in the
language

Ben Elton is a genius. But what I will point out is that Baldrick's novel is a paragraph. "Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and he lived happily ever after. The End." So therefore it's a prose novel.

As for Humpty Dumpty's story, i don't remember it from Aloce om Wonderland and google isn't being helpful, although I will say that Humpty Dumpty's discourse on semiotics in Through the Looking Glass is one of my favorite Lewis Carroll moments. Right up there with the Walrus and The Carpenter and the Caterpillar.

One of the editors of Words and Images asked me to post this on the poet=
ics list so here it is.

Words and Images, a literary journal published in Portland,  Maine, sinc=
e 1969, is looking for poetry submissions for the Spring,  2008, issue. =
No tired writing, please; poems must be excellent  and alive. We're look=
ing for poetry with an emphasis on form and  technique, about specific p=
laces and specific feelings. We're also  looking for quietly experimenta=
l poems - for  work which pushes the boundaries of form, but never at th=
e  expense of emotion. We do not want any poems about writing  poetry wi=
elding their postmodernity for no reason other than just to do  so! More=
 information is online at   wordsnimages.org.  Deadline for submissions =
is December 31, 2007. Don't feel daunted for  lack of previous publicati=
ons; we shine flashlights under rocks in  search of new voices. Check us=
 out. Onward!

Since I made the musical comment it seemed appropriate that I should pitch a few thoughts into the ring: I've been recently reading Borges so I'll start --
  ********************************************************************************
  Although Borges states that all art aspires to Music, painting is the penultimate muse. Of course, Borges wasn't talking about inspiration. & the fact that music & poetry share many characteristics is obvious. But painting & poetry are similar too. Not long ago, Cezanne & DA DA where at the east & west wings of the National Gallery in D.C. In Cezanne, I saw quietness, a master serenely delving into nature. Painting seems somehow both scientific & spiritual. It seemed as though Cezanne was in awe of nature, intent on looking deeply & getting as much as possible on to the canvas. Both his landscapes & his portraiture were breath taking. Cezanne, both classicist & innovator. It seems obvious that he anticipated cubism. & Da Da: It was as jarring as it was exhilarating to see the contrast, the way Da Da reflected the upheaval in the 30s, and to reflect back on Cezanne. Cezanne seemed a monk compared to Duchamp & the world that DA DA came out of. Usually, when I attend an art
 exhibit, I maintain what seems an appropriate emotional distance from the work I'm viewing. In these exhibits, it seemed I was more emotionally then intellectually charged. I envy painters. I sometimes long for an escape from language. The eye is so incredibly precious.

Apropo of ?
i dreamt of Gertrude and Alice last night.
i wanted to know if anyone ever saw/photographed/drew their bedroom,
as i knew it was never seen by anyone else in their lifetimes.
i wondered if it was decorated as i was sure Alice liked
things--throws and curtains and lounging areas and so bohemian.

Writing etc., etc., is always something of a language battleground. I
have trouble using the word creative
because of the purposes to which it is used by people and in situations
of influence. I have no such trouble in the way you use it here, and
indeed agree with all you say-my word 'understanding' does not, as you
say, say enough. If you are now expanding on your 'poetry, well, you
draw your own conclusions', well, I have no complaints. What Murat took
from it, however, was something different: cutting one's cloth according
to size of audience, and it seemed to me to make you both advocates for
a poetry as practice outside the public sphere. So, accepting your
reservations about the use of the word understanding I  still prefer
your definition of prose.=20
=20

There is a complex and interesting history of poetry/prose distinctions
stretching back behind this thread. I'm much less interested than some
people in the inhouse issue between poetry and fiction, poetry and
criticism which too often comes down to craft issues which are mostly
boring, than in the question of where  poetry (and literature, in
general) sits in relation  to the writing practices in the public
sphere. Calling those practices 'prose' was confusing, I grant.  Or,
rather those craft issues are not boring if they are always  thought of
as having a relation like it or not --it could be called a political
relation--to the aforesaid writing practices.
the jig-saw analogy is useful as far as it goes, but you can see (I
hope) I want something more from the distinction. Cheer, Wystan (snarky
person)

When you write/draw/program/paint/perform/whatever a poem that people
respond well to, sometimes it's because it has somehow engaged them
creatively; there may indeed be material to understand in the poem, and
that may be part of the other person's interest in it, but who on earth
reads poetry simply to understand what the poet is saying? I think many
read it to be engaged creatively in what they can make of it.

Poetry is always already interactive. Is it a jig-saw or can it be put
together more ways than one? Jig-saws are prose. Poetry is a much more
interesting construction.

One that doesn't simply seek to be 'understood' but to engage the reader
creatively, let them bring their whole wealth of knowledge and
experience to an active construction of meaning, meaning which may
ultimately be of their own making.

All,
I am personally beggin all of you to trim old material
from your posts as much as possible, as a courtesy to
those of us who receive digests, so that we don't
spend all our time scrolling through old messages
we've already read. Quoting layers (>, >>) are not
reliable guides for which messages are current.
This will encourage us poor digesters, perhaps, to
contribute more to the discussion.
At the risk of appearing ignorant, can someone
(Pierre? Barry?...) provide a rigorous definition of
deep image for me?
Amicalement,
Alex

Scrub
By Emily Nemens
Shady Lane Press
November 2007
Wash me, till I am whiter than snow.
--Kol Nidre Service, Gates of Repentance
Each September, the Jewish calendar begins anew with Rosh Hashanah. It is followed by ten Days of Awe, a period of reflection and repentance. The High Holy Days close with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. On this day Jews fast and ask God to forgive their sins. Reminded of human suffering by the day’s hunger pangs, they also pardon all who have wronged them in the past year, and pray all those that they have wronged will grant the same forgiveness. The absolution of these worldly conflicts is given the same significance as prayers offered up to heaven, and only after this cycle is complete may the new year begin.
Scrub is collection of stories written in and about these holy days. Taken out of the context of Judaism, the stories explore the more universal process of atonement. A homeless man walking across Providence, a pregnant sixteen-year-old cruising around Seattle, an Italian ballet dancer performing on New York’s premier stage, and a boy driving across the country to save his best friend...each has been dealt a shattering blow, and each is seeking the forgiveness that will set them on the path to being whole again. Wrestling with transgression and repentance, the characters of Scrub try to wash away their wrongs by extreme measure, eventually turning to acceptance and finally finding hope.
Three of the four stories in Scrub were written during the author’s first month as writer-in-residence at the Kerouac Project of Orlando in September 2007. The fourth, Blue-eyed Apples, is the prologue to her first novel and the piece she submitted to the Kerouac Project’s selection committee. The author illustrated the collection as well.
About the Author
Emily Nemens is the Fall 2007 writer in residence at the Kerouac House. Always striving to bring visual arts, design, and literature together in a compelling way, she has written and illustrated a graphic novel about the 2004 Madrid train bombings (on-view at www.nemens.com/madrid_comic.html), edited a book for the Education department of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and an excerpt of her first novel, Blue-eyed Apples, was selected for The L Magazine’s 2007 Literary Upstart Competition. She grew up in Seattle and graduated from Brown University in 2005. She now lives in Brooklyn, where she works as a writer, designer, painter, and occasional musician.

Actually, Steve, a pretty fair number of Language poets are accomplished
musicians. Sheila E. Murphy and Peter Ganick come to mind immediately.

***THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15TH AT 7PM***
A Performance by David Grubbs and Susan Howe:
"Souls of the Labadie Tract"

Bond Chapel, 1050 E. 59th Street
Chicago, IL
Free and open to the public

Souls of the Labadie Tract takes as its starting point
a substantial new poem by Howe that will appear in a
collection bearing the same title, to be published in
2007 by New Directions. The Labadists were a Utopian
Quietest sect that moved from the Netherlands to Cecil
County, Maryland in 1684. The community dissolved in
1722.  Grubbs' chosen instruments for this piece
include two species of khaen, Laotian free-reed mouth
organs that at signal moments fluoresce into a full
ensemble. A distant VCS3 synthesizer slowly moves to
the foreground with what becomes a full-circuited
roar.

***SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 17TH AT 7PM***

Amazing. I grew up in Orlando, Florida, blocks from Edgewater Drive. Cool name: (Edgewater), but the place was incredibly boring back in my day. Disney. Disney. & more Disney. No this: Here’s where you can meet Emily, hear her read, and get a signed copy of Scrub:

Wednesday, November 14th @ 7pm - "Soft Focus" at Infusion Tea, 1600 Edgewater Drive, Orlando, 32804.

Saturday, November 17th @ 8pm - Emily's Farewell Reading at the Kerouac House, 1418 Clouser Avenue, Orlando, FL 32804.

Scrub
By Emily Nemens
Shady Lane Press
November 2007
Wash me, till I am whiter than snow.
--Kol Nidre Service, Gates of Repentance
Each September, the Jewish calendar begins anew with Rosh Hashanah. It is followed by ten Days of Awe, a period of reflection and repentance. The High Holy Days close with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. On this day Jews fast and ask God to forgive their sins. Reminded of human suffering by the day’s hunger pangs, they also pardon all who have wronged them in the past year, and pray all those that they have wronged will grant the same forgiveness. The absolution of these worldly conflicts is given the same significance as prayers offered up to heaven, and only after this cycle is complete may the new year begin.
Scrub is collection of stories written in and about these holy days. Taken out of the context of Judaism, the stories explore the more universal process of atonement. A homeless man walking across Providence, a pregnant sixteen-year-old cruising around Seattle, an Italian ballet dancer performing on New York’s premier stage, and a boy driving across the country to save his best friend...each has been dealt a shattering blow, and each is seeking the forgiveness that will set them on the path to being whole again. Wrestling with transgression and repentance, the characters of Scrub try to wash away their wrongs by extreme measure, eventually turning to acceptance and finally finding hope.
Three of the four stories in Scrub were written during the author’s first month as writer-in-residence at the Kerouac Project of Orlando in September 2007. The fourth, Blue-eyed Apples, is the prologue to her first novel and the piece she submitted to the Kerouac Project’s selection committee. The author illustrated the collection as well.
About the Author
Emily Nemens is the Fall 2007 writer in residence at the Kerouac House. Always striving to bring visual arts, design, and literature together in a compelling way, she has written and illustrated a graphic novel about the 2004 Madrid train bombings (on-view at www.nemens.com/madrid_comic.html), edited a book for the Education department of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and an excerpt of her first novel, Blue-eyed Apples, was selected for The L Magazine’s 2007 Literary Upstart Competition. She grew up in Seattle and graduated from Brown University in 2005. She now lives in Brooklyn, where she works as a writer, designer, painter, and occasional musician.

Steve,

I, too, long for an escape from language. I think this best resonates with why I write poetry...

Best,

Below is the announcement for the reading on Friday the 16th that has
made it possible for Murat Nemet-Nejat to come read in Chapel Hill NC on
Saturday the 17th.  Two of the three authors featured in the Friday
night reading were featured in Murat's amazing anthology of contemporary
Turkish poetry, _Eda_.  I hope you will be able to join us at Duke's
Franklin Center Friday evening for this truly remarkable reading hosted
by DUCIS and again at my home on Saturday the 17th for what I hope will
be another excellent reading.

Here is a map to help you find the Franklin Center:

I have included an announcement for the reading at my own home as well.

Please forward.  Thank you.

Best,

First, Friday evening's event:

**********************************************
-------- Original Message --------
Subject: 	A Reading by 3 Contemporary Turkish Poets -- Friday 11.16.07
Date: 	Fri, 09 Nov 2007 14:22:28 -0500
From: 	Dan Smith <dan.smith@duke.edu>
To: 	Duke University International Arts <intl-arts@duke.edu>, Duke
Center for International Studies - Global Studies <intl-global@duke.edu>



Please join the *Duke University Center for International Studies* for:

/A Reading by 3 Contemporary Turkish Poets/


Lale Müldür
Güven Turan and
Seyhan Erözçelik


*Friday, Nov. 16, 2007
6.30-8.00 pm** *

John Hope Franklin Center Room 240
2204 Erwin Road
/(parking available across street in Pickens lot) /

The poetry of Lale Müldür, Güven Turan and Seyhan Erözçelik scintillates
with the tensions and excitement of Istanbul as the fusion point of
liberated Eastern Europe and emerging Turkic Republics after the fall of
the Soviet Union at the beginning of the new millennium.

The three poets visiting Duke University reflect these gigantic
historical movements in their poetry. For instance, Lale Müldür, in her
poem "Waking to Constantinople," imagines a synthesis between the
Byzantine/Christian past of the city, extending back for one thousand
years, as well as its Islamic past, calling for a new name for the city.
In his poem, "Coffee Grinds," the poet Seyhan Erözçelik brings the
Central Asian, Shamanistic tradition of fortune-telling by creating the
hopeful, meandering magical cadences of these fortune readings in his
poetry. In the filigree delicacy of his poetry, the poet Güven Turan
presents a vision of cosmic nature, stripped of any boundaries.

For more information about this event, please contact Erdað Göknar at
goknar@duke.edu


With support from the U.S. Dept. of Education and the Office of the Vice
Provost for International Affairs


**********************************************
  Then, Saturday evening's event:

Howdy friends -

The evening of Saturday November 17 I will be hosting a poetry reading
at my home in Chapel Hill NC (map: http://tinyurl.com/yoganf) to which
you are all invited.  I am hosting this reading in celebration of the
arrival of Murat along with Turkish poets Lale Müldür, Güven Turan and
Seyhan Erözçelik.  It is my aim to share some of our best poetry with
our Turkish visitors.

The readers include

Murat Nemet-Nejat
residing in Hoboken, NJ; originally from Turkey
http://google.com/search?q=murat+nemet-nejat

Standard Schaefer
residing in San Francisco, CA; originally from Texas
http://google.com/search?q=standard+schaefer

Rodrigo Garcia Lopes
residing in Chapel Hill, NC; originally from Londrina, Brazil
http://google.com/search?q=rodrigo+garcia+lopes

Allyssa Wolf
residing in Raleigh, NC; originally from Ohio
http://google.com/search?q=allyssa+wolf


I'm also planning to screen the film _Satori Uso_
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkkNV77h28) based on a character by
Rodrigo Garcia Lopes as well as Julian Semilian's new surrealist short
film, _Tear Void Insomnia Mist_.  If you don't know him, Julian is an
all-around brilliant poet/filmmaker/artist (http://tinyurl.com/yw5bmz)
who teaches at the NC School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, NC

I will probably open my door to everyone around 9PM and start readings
around 10.

More details are to follow soon and what is listed here is
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  Consider this a save-the-date notice.  And don't
hesitate to email me should you have any questions for me.

Patrick

I think of audience as through time. Poetry shapes the way imagination moves
through language. We breed springboks, people capable of compelling leaps of
imagination who trust in themselves to land on their feet. And who trust
others to follow that sort of writing in whatever way is appropriate--either
with their own leap to a different spot, or something else. That's basically
what I mean by 'creative'.

It can also mean 'constructive'. When we're asked to construct something.
Something worth building. Which we do anyway when reading, but not always
with brio or awareness or aspiration.

Some people, when they write, take their best leaps when they think no one
is watching. Some mean to communicate with other people, yet can seem out of
touch with themselves or history or poetry or language or other
technologies. I suppose that, in poetry, the public and private channels are
both open, wide open to the personal, public and channels of media.

Yes, public political speech, for instance, is a bulwark of rhetoric,
strategy, tactics, the unassailable, the mildly interesting, the perfectly
respectable, the patriotic platitude, the fashionably veiled, the kinder
gentler machine gun hand. The elliptical compression invites guessing. Which
way will the hand strike?

Please join us this Monday, November 12th for "Zukofsky, the Objective
and the Small Press," a lecture by Michael Cross. This talk will take
place at NOON in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen.



_The Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series_ dedicates itself to
the study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot.
The lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry
Collection, at SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse
formations, the status of ephemera and the making of genre, the
conditions of literary production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in
and between specific magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book
art, and how the little magazine functions in the making of the
avant-garde.


This event is funded by the Mildred Lockwood Lacey Fund for Poetry/The
Poetry Collection and is free and open to the public.

Yes I am a transplant and in the past two years have tried to come out of the shadow of the Mouse.(no easy task)
This was Jack's town first.
There is a great deal of very talented people in Orlando.
Adam Tritt was one of my featured people a few months back--an intelligent and witty poet. Mark Salerno will be stopping by on his book tour in March.

This is an open call to anyone--coming here on vacation.
let me know  ahead and we can feature you.

Would love to expose this area to visual poetics---IT"S TIME

Could someone who knows something about it, please tap a few lines about
Norman Mailer's work & legacy?  I want to hear it from a poetics  stance; where
does he fit in a Stein or Hemingway continuum?  His death  follows upon Grace
Paley's like a grieved husband's.  They were both  84.  I've read from Armies
of the Night & think its prose was amongst  the best in that anthology of
postmodernism.  Of course, schools didn't let  us read Mailer.  Probably certain
professors drank over it.  When  I was recently in NY, a panhandler followed us
past the farmer's market at St.  Mark's and pressed upon us the information
that Norman Mailer had stabbed at his  wife and gone to Bellevue.  When? we
asked him.  The panhandler got  some of our coins because his eyes were so serious
-- he looked like an aged  boxer.  I had fumed like an air-boxer where I
live, and instead of  writing, hoped the smoke up my intellectual property
chimney, almost  Melvillian, would go to Mailer, not to Roth or Updike.  AMB

Mailer's book on the Frazier/Ali fight was excellent. He stabbed his wife ( # 3 or 4 ) during the sixties, before the '68 Democratic convention in Chicago. I saw him 5 years ago at the National Press Club. I asked him a question about Gary Gilmore & Jack Henry Abbott that made him squirm. In case you don't remember, Jack Henry Abbot is the author of the prison memoir "In The Belly of The Beast." Abbott stabbed and killed a waiter in New York.

  I read "Armies of the Night" in college. I read a bunch of Mailer in college. My enthusiasm for him has waned since then, but the guy had his moments. Anyone interested in NASA should check out "Of Fire On The Moon."

My memory isn't so good. From David Chirot's NY Times link:

  In November 1960, Mr. Mailer stabbed his second wife, Adele Morales, with a penknife, seriously wounding her. The incident happened at the end of an all-night party announcing Mr. Mailer’s intention to run in the 1961 mayoral campaign, and he, like many of his guests, had been drinking heavily. Mr. Mailer was arrested, but his wife declined to press charges, and he was eventually released after being sent to Bellevue Hospital for observation. The marriage broke up two years later.
  All told, Mr. Mailer was married six times, counting a quickie with Carol Stevens, whom he married and divorced within a couple of days in 1980 to grant legitimacy to their daughter, Maggie. His other wives, in addition to Ms. Silverman and Ms. Morales, were Lady Jeanne Campbell, granddaughter of Lord Beaverbrook; Beverly Rentz Bentley; and Norris Church, with whom he was living at his death. Lady Campbell died in June.In the 1970s Mr. Mailer entered into a long feud with feminists and proponents of women’s liberation, and in a famous 1971 debate with Germaine Greer at Town Hall in Manhattan he declared himself an “enemy of birth control.” He meant it. By his various wives, Mr. Mailer had nine children, all of whom survive him: Susan, by Ms. Silverman; Danielle and Elizabeth Anne, by Ms. Morales; Kate, by Lady Campbell; Michael Burks and Stephen McLeod, by Ms. Bentley; Maggie Alexandra, by Ms. Stevens; and John Buffalo, by Ms. Church. Also surviving are an adopted son,
 Matthew, by an earlier marriage of Ms. Norris’s, and 10 grandchildren.

Another week of putting signs on chain link fences on windward O`ahu,
and roadside memorials to the dead in the
Iraq war.  Those with the number of Iraqi dead disappear more quickly
than those with only the number of Americans
killed.  Sad to say.

One Impeach sign disappeared before it could be photographed.  The
others are here.  Simply click to enlarge the photograph
and read its story.

No signs next week; am off to the west coast for some literary events.
Feel free to put some up on fences yourselves!

aloha, Susan

in memoriam




Without causes and truths, without facts and others.


(continuation of a philosophical thread)

Events without causes: Flying saucers. Dwarf citings. Alien abductions.
Hurricanes and other chaotic phenomena. Cryptozoological species sight-
ings. Britney Spears. Serial killings. Sniper fire. Or what is a cause. Or
is it? Or the epistemology and ontology of causes. Or linkages and ghosts.

Events without truth: Battle casualties. Enumerations from one or another
side. Enumerations from witnesses. From engaged witnesses. From embedded
witnesses. From satellites. From a distance. Abu Gharayb. Redactions.
Contradictions. Disintegrations. Censorings. Or what is a truth. Or the
epistemology and ontology of truths. Or Being and beings, Truth and
truths. Or separations and presences.

Or none or all of these.

Let me explain.

1 There are events without causes. Or one might think of reverse engin-
eering of an event backwards into a chaotic cloud. Imagine chaos all the
way down. Dwarves were cited in late medieval Germany. There are always
portents in the sky. UFOs are described. Alien abductions share things in
common. It is irrelevant whether something or nothing was there. Events in
parallel do not prove causation. Relation is not causation. Perhaps
nothing causes war.

2 There are battles without truths. There are casualty reports by both
militaries; by other observers. Reports almost never tally. There is
nothing to tally. There are deaths but there are not enumerable deaths.
There are always deaths elsewhere, inwards and outwards. There are always
deaths without causes.

3 I am thinking about operations without truths and causes. Casualties
accumulate according to protocols. There are semantic clouds. There are
ruptures, disseminations, gatherings, filterings. I cannot prove an
enumeration, nor can I prove a cause. A cause is a linkage among machines
that tends towards reiteration among cycles. Machines at best are local
distributions. The machine has indefinite chains, accumulations. There are
never enough chains.

4 One counts chains, local neighborhoods of filterings. One arrives at the
station. The station says truth or cause, and that seems sufficient. There
are rails. The rails are always already guides, to be rusted, mistrusted.
Nothing moves but the sememe. The sememe is a nomadic maw; the sememe
produces conclusions. The sememe is the postcloud, the chaotic cloud is
the precloud. Cause is interstitial. A mixup not to be confused with
structure.

5 A portent is not a cause. An action and reaction are couplings, rela-
tions, associations. They are imminent, ride the surface of the inter-
stitial. Don't mistake them for cause.

6 Deaths are not a cause for truth or enumeration. There is no truth in
death, in war, in illness. There are stations which filter truth. They
construct truth. There are facts but far fewer than presumed. A death may
be a fact; deaths are not facts. Wars are not facts.

7 The core of it: facts are neither true nor false. Facts are. Facts are
indescribable. There is no economy, no political economy, of facts. Facts
are invisible. Facts are not caused by facts. There is only reverse engin-
eering of chaotic clouds. No cloud is perfect. Clouds and languages mis-
match. Clouds and languagings mismatch.

8 To write fact, truth, cause, is to write inerrancy. To write inerrancy
is to inscribe, construct a logical negative. Negatives do not exist;
selves are always others, others are always others. Others disappear like
facts; others are invisible. Others are facts are others. Others do not
cause, are not caused, harbor no truth. Truth is always somewhere else.

9 Truth is always somewhere else; truth is always someone else. Truth is
always spoken by the other. The speaking of truth by the other is the
speaking of the visible other, who is not other. Others do not speak.

10 Without truths there are actions. Without causes there are resistances.
Without facts there are worlds. There are worlds without facts and others.
Our world is our own world without facts and others. Our own world is
invisible to us. Our own world is a disappearance.

11 'With facts there are words. There are words with facts and others. Our
words are our own words with facts and others. Our own words are visible
to us. Our own word is an appearance.'

12 One says: 'It is clear now that there are no events. There is no
reverse engineering. Surely there are clouds, surely there are preclouds
and postclouds. Surely they are clear.'


'Whatever _is_ may _not be._' (Hume)

... endorsed by such figures as Harry Belafonte, Howard Zinn, Noam
Chomsky, Ramsey Clark, Thom Hartmann, Ralph Nader, FreeSpeechTV, Pete
Seeger, Kevin Zeese, and others.

Cost of Freedom: The Anthology of Peace and Activism is being hailed
as "not just a book, but a national movement."  Not only do peace and
antiwar organizations receive the book at wholesale, but the
objective, through the Cost of Freedom Foundation (in process), is to
donate a portion of the proceeds to the work of these not-for-profit
organizations to help them with their continued struggle to halt the
war and the warmongers, and to bring about a better world for
everyone.

The anthology features anti-war art, photographs, poems, articles,
stories, and so on--in fact, 166 pages of inspirational information
(many in full color) that speaks crucially to the fact that peace is
the only answer to the problems now facing us, and peace is the
unifying element that will bring the world together in one accord.

...  Here also are two links to Cost of Freedom's web presence:
http://costoffreedom.blogspotcom and
www.myspace.com/costoffreedombook

Cost of Freedom is filled with crucial information, and it is
convincing in its presentation of the work of over 100 contributors;
and, as Thom Hartmann notes, this is a large, beautiful, coffee-table
style book, printed on fine paper in two editions, softcover and
hardbound, and both are available to your group.

At this time, to eliminate competition from bookstore chains,
Amazon.com, etc., Cost of Freedom is not being offered to them for
sale.  Instead, we would like to see peace and anti-war groups make
the money that would otherwise go to the corporations and business
interests.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, please call
or e-mail me.

I am the senior editor at Howling Dog Press, the publisher of Cost of
Freedom, and I have the authority to distribute books to you at
wholesale.

My co-editors and I are planning a sequel to Cost of Freedom.  Perhaps
you have your own stories, art and poems that you would like to
contribute to the second book.  We encourage you to see the wonderful
format and layout of the first book and summarily prepare to submit
work for the book that is to follow.

Here is a link to a recent radio interview where my co-editor, Whitney
Trettien, and I are being interviewed about Cost of Freedom.  You will
see how very enthusiastic the program hosts are about the book and its
potential to bring about change:

"If the world is ever going to be changed, it will be through the
efforts of millions of individuals and small organizations.  Cost of
Freedom tells the encouraging stories of many who have begun this
work." --Pete Seeger

I don't recall seeing anything from anyone about From the Other World:
Poems in Memory of James Wright, although there was a thread a short time
ago about Wright's poetry.   Let this serve as announcement of the
publication of this anthology.



I received my contributor's copies in Friday's mail and found that my work
is appearing with memorial poems and prose from Merwin, Bly, Hugo, Kinnell,
Williams (C.K.), and some other notable poets.



Then, there's me, just happy to be there, like I am in the rest of my life.



Take a look at this beautiful, evocative anthology at www.losthillsbook.com

Turn it up
by Margot Malia Lynch

when you give focused attention to the tree
she will slowly turn
towards your face.
the stars move if you stare at them long enough.
I am feeling a slow turn towards me
of the people who desire the connection
who live for expansion towards the fire.
I=92m burning a blaze to brighten the insides of
THE SEARCHERS. THE SEEKERS.
The living want to be seen and I see you.
soon you will see your light in my eyes.
You are channeling the midnight sun. Turning
into yourself the mirror of the soul.
I saw you leave your body
just to return
with a kiss
like your own sleeping beauty.
I saw you waking me when I was in a dream.
With just a turn
of the head the whole world changes.
When you kneel down and pray do you listen?
Turning your perspective=A0up.
I see you in your ascension.
I want to ride it high. Turn in up.
Turn it way way up. On my way way up.
Turn it up.

This Thursday Nov 15 @ 6pm I'll be giving a talk on public art practices in the Bay Area at the SF Public Library. I'll be showing slides & looking at recent works & interventions performed by local artists, as well as interrogating the parameters by which we tend to define "public" and "art" in the context of an increasingly privatized & corporatized urban landscape. I'm also aiming to look at some counter-practices, especially those everyday life-world practices that don't always "read" as "art", as well as exploring some speculative practices that might yet emerge out of our collective tactics as engaged citizen-artists.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:


Claudia Rankine & Sarah Rosenthal

Friday, November 16, 2007
Timken Lecture Hall     7:30 p.m.
Refreshments will be served

Join us!


Claudia Rankine is the author of four collections of poetry,
including, most recently, Don't Let Me Be Lonely --an experimental
project blending poetry, essays and images, of which poet Robert
Creely wrote: "Claudia Rankine here manages an extraordinary melding
of means to effect the most articulate and moving testament to the
bleak times we live in I've yet seen.   It's a master work in every
sense, and altogether her own."   Rankine's work has been published in
The Boston Review, Jubilat, The Kenyon Review, TriQuarterly, and many
other journals.   This is an evening of poetry not to be missed!


Sarah Rosenthal's cross-genre book Manhatten (Spuyten Duyvil,
forthcoming) was shortlisted for the Starcherone Fiction Prize. Her
chapbooks include How I Wrote This Story (Margin to Margin, 2001),
sitings (a+bend, 2000), and not-chicago (Melodeon, 1998). Her poetry
and fiction have appeared in numerous journals such as  Xcp
(Cross-Cultural Poetics), 26, Bird Dog, Aufgabe, and Boston Review,
and have been anthologized in Bay Poetics (Faux Press, 2005) and
hinge: A BOAS Anthology (Crack Press, 2002). She has taught creative
writing at San Francisco State University and Santa Clara University
as well as privately. She is editing a collection of interviews with
Bay Area avant-garde writers. She is a recipient of the Leo Litwak
Award for Fiction.

About Manhatten Juliana Spahr writes, "This is not the mythic
Manhattan of bright lights and glitz. It is called Manhatten and it is
wonderfully out of kilter. In this mixed-genre book (fiction, poetry,
review), Sarah Rosenthal layers headlong, voice-driven prose with
silent, otherly poems to tell a story of an island where relationships
are disturbed yet meaningful and luminous."


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
There's no better time to join SPT!

OTHERWISE. Not the world's least frequently-cultivated blog, but far from the most cared-for, or the most succinct. Nonetheless, recent posts exist, and include text-art and posts on the Spahr-Young/Ashton debate, Kent Johnson, Paul Chan, Robin Blaser, Lou & Peter Berryman, Jasper Bernes, Jess and more!

Was Norman Mailer really such a great writer?  Toward the end of his life he wrote a book of poems which was terrible.  The only book of his I ever read all the way through was "Advertisements For Myself" which I liked at the time.  When I looked at it a few years ago, it seemed dated.  Anyway, one of his novels, I forget which one, has a passage in which the narrator gets a rush out of stabbing his wife to death.  A couple of years ago I decided not to review an anthology in which the excerpt describing the stabbing and the rush appeared.  It seemed immoral in the worst sense, especially since Mailer once did stab his real wife at the time who, masochist that she was, declined to press charges even though she was seriously injured.  It may be that Mailer's other books or some of them justified the public's tolerance of his worst side as a person.  I just don't know.  Regards, Tom Savage

Alok Sarkar (b 1933) is a celebrated Indian poet from the 1950's generation.
He commands a solid and significant body of work written over nearly
half-a-century which includes more than a dozen collections of poetry,
several volumes of poetry-prose, an autobiography etc. Poetry Fortnightly
Press (Kabita Pakkhik), Kolkata, has published his collected poems in four
volumes.

Alok Sarkar has received several poetry awards during an illustrious
literary career the most noteworthy of which is the Tagore Award (Rabindra
Purashkar) for literature - the highest state award in Bengali literature -
which he relinquished this year in a protest against the neo-liberal Marxist
state government of West Bengal, for launching genocides against poor
peasants unwilling to surrender their farmlands to a government-sponsored
spree of rapid and mandatory industrialization.

Kaurab Online presents a brief exposure to Alok Sarkar's work here -

http://www.kaurab.com/english/aalok.html

Alok Sarkar's poetry is founded on cultural and linguistic traditions that
are deeply vernacular. Rather ascetic is nature, Alok Sarkar's poetry is
made with words and images that are carefully weighed and optimized. Absence
is a key element of his poetry. Many of his images are mirrored thru the
void. A color scheme is often expressed via a complete absence of colors.
Meaning is anointed with meaninglessness. Subjectivity is either reversed or
pushed out of focus to the periphery.

As the pronouncement of existence gets sharper in his poetry, Alok tends to
follow more avidly the "non-existence of existence". Nought always occupies
a special place in his poetry. The occupancy of space by nought is one of
the most imperative constituents of his entire thought-process. Nought, too,
signifies existence. It is the presence of nought that complements the
existence of nothingness.

The poet is currently in Boston, visiting his son. We would like to
encourage poets living in the Boston area to invite him to local readings
during his stay. Sarkar plans to return to India early January, 08.

since when were writers the voice of morality?

Thank you. Mailer was probing the extremes of experience, willfully
exploring the taboo throughout his career. To get to the kind of knowledge
he was seeking, one has to transgress morality. In fact, he laid the
groundwork for most of it in "Advertisements for Myself." I judge a writer's
writing, not his conduct. If I did otherwise, I'd eliminate Dostoevsky,
Pound, Celine, Burroughs, and many others, and it would be my loss.

Just so, Vernon.

I loved the book _Charles Olson and Ezra Pound: An Encounter at St
Elizabeth's_ taken from the notebook pages Olson would write after =
visiting
Pound a few days a week. Some nights Olson would write about loving to =
hear
Pound describe, say, the exact shade of light coming from a lake on one =
of
his walking tours of the 1920s, praising the clarity of his memory and
intelligence. Other nights he'd be fuming remembering Pound's economic =
dogma
and anti-Semitism earlier that day.=20

Both great and flawed like his poetry. Parallel to what Duncan wrote: =
"their
unfaltering wrongness that has style"

Mailer could be an asshole, but possibly his worst moment came when he was acting out of concern. He helped get Jack Henry Abbott out of prison. I think Mailer saw Abbott as his
  Genet. Mailer was always coming up with pseudo existential sound bites. I think Mailer wanted to be the literary equivalent of Sartre. He was fond of the word evil. When he came to the National Press Club, I asked him if he considered Gary Gilmore or Abbott to be evil men.
  He said he couldn't judge. That he wasn't God. For Mailer to say he wasn't God was to display a degree of humility unusual for him.

Unlike Dostoyevsky, Pound, Celine, Burroughs--Mailer never really did any "=
hard time" (prison, exile, institutions) in any way for anything in life.
As the article noted, he was a pampered child, and was pampered throughout =
his career.
I've read most of his work, with the exception of the late novels, seen the=
 films, and met him etc.
I don't believe in saying anything bad of the recently deceased, if I can h=
elp it.=20
His work and life --excepting combat in WW2--was almost always being done i=
n a safe distance following after others had done the dangerous parts and p=
aid the price.  By dangerous I include also taking risks in writing, ideas,=
 politics, art.
The stabbed wife being written about here recently was in fact the woman wh=
o had been Jack Kerouac's lover and is the model for Mardou Fox in Kerouac'=
s book The Subterraneans.  She was variously described by others as "mulatt=
o" or "light skinned,"--something bitterly ironic that she be stabbed by th=
e author of "The White Negro".

The Last Supper

Nicol=E1s Dumit Est=E9vez
Thursday, November 15, 2007
5:30 pm. =96 7:30 pm.
Collector's Room,
U.S Custom House, One Bowling Green
(enter at National Museum of the American Indian)
www.lmcc.net
http://lmcc.net/art/residencies/tenyear/pilgrim/index.html

Space is limited. Please come early.

Twelve artists/curators gather at one table with Nicol=E1s Dumit Est=E9vez =
in a
reflection of the relationship of art to ritual. This is the culminating
event of For Art's Sake, a series of pilgrimages conceived of, and
undertaken by Est=E9vez over the past three years. Evoking the pilgrimage o=
f
El Camino de Santiago de Compostela in Spain where Catholic devotees travel
to the reliquary of St. James the Apostle, Est=E9vez's secular twist has ta=
ken
him on pilgrimages to museums in the New York metropolitan area, each time
with a new penance =96 on his knees, walking backwards, spreading the "word=
 of
art". The guests at the table bring their own audio-visual and performative
double-take on these journeys. Participants include Nao Bustamante, Deborah
Cullen, Olivia Georgia, Alanna Lockward, Yasmin Ramirez, Olivia Aldin
standing in for Linda Montano, Tom Finkelpearl, Claire Tancons, Sara
Reisman, Juliana Driever, Alexander Campos and Rocio Aranda

The Last Supper is part of the celebration of ten years of Lower Manhattan
Cultural Council's Workspace Residency and part of the Centennial
Celebration of Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. Est=E9vez developed Fo=
r
Art's Sake while in residence at Lower Manhattan Cultural Council in 2004 i=
n
collaboration with Franklin Furnace.

Nicol=E1s Dumit Est=E9vez is an interdisciplinary artist who has exhibited =
and
performed extensively in the US as well as internationally at venues such a=
s
Madrid Abierto/ ARCO, The IX Havanna Biennial, and others. Awards include
the PS1/MoMA National Studio Program, the Lambent Fellowship Program of
Tides Foundation, the Michael Richards Fund of LMCC and the Franklin Furnac=
e
Fund for Performance Art. His work has been reviewed in The New York Times,
NYArts Magazine, and in major publications in Mexico, Spain, Cuba and the
Dominican Republic. He has been commissioned to create a public interventio=
n
for the MacDowell Colony Centennial Celebration in 2007. Born in Santiago d=
e
los Treinta Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Est=E9vez lives and works in th=
e
South Bronx.

Past Pilgrimages

For the first journey on March 20, 2005, Est=E9vez was heavily laden with
donated art publications strapped to his back for a trip that took him from
the heart of the world's financial capital in Lower Manhattan to East
Harlem. El Museo del Barrio's Director Juli=E1n Zugazagoitia commemorated t=
he
performance by signing Est=E9vez's passport.

For his second pilgrimage on June 28 and 29, 2005, Est=E9vez forged his way
walking backwards from LMCC downtown to The Bronx Museum of the Arts,
spending the night on a hard bed of art catalogues provided by Longwood Art=
s
Project, Bronx Council on the Arts. The strenuous two-day journey came to a=
n
end when the Director of The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Olivia Georgia,
officially greeted him at the door and signed his passport.

During his third journey of the series on Sunday, December 4, 2005, Est=E9v=
ez
walked from LMCC to the Studio Museum in Harlem (SMH) dressed in austere
black and white raiment and wearing a heavy iron crown embellished with
seven admission buttons from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Upon his
arrival at SMH, Director of Education and Public Programs, Sandra Jackson
lifted the crown off his shoulders and signed the passport, thus confirming
that the journey was successfully completed.

For the fourth pilgrimage on February 2, 2006, Est=E9vez traveled by foot a=
nd
ferry from the offices of LMCC in Lower Manhattan to the Jersey City Museum=
,
stopping at educational and cultural organizations along the route: an
Episcopal church, an all-boys Catholic school and a public school, to
"Spread the Word" about performance art and the penances that he has been
undertaking. Following Estevez' arrival at the Jersey City Museum, Marion
Grzesiak, Executive Director, recorded her signature in the passport.

As part of the fifth penance on October 28, 2006, Est=E9vez traveled on his
knees from the offices of LMCC on Maiden Lane to the Smithsonian's National
Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) at Bowling Green. In this occasion he
carried in his hands a piece of casabe, a type of bread prepared from the
indigenous cassavaroot, thus transporting a legacy of the Caribbean Ta=EDno
culture that was presented as a gift to the host institution. Peter Brill,
NMAI's Assistant Director for Exhibitions, Public Programs and Public
Spaces, signed the passport.

For the sixth penance he journeyed from LMCC, to the Queens Museum of Art,
stopping at several sites to give presentations entitled Seven Lives,
through which he introduce his audiences to the works of seven consecrated
performance artists. Tom Finkelpearl, Executive Director of the Queens
Museum vouched for the completion of the pilgrimage by signing the passport=
.


For the seventh and final pilgrimage on October 26, 2007, entitled "Be my
Shepherd: On My Way to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum," Est=E9vez
traveled by foot from the offices of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council,
carrying a small suitcase with a change of clothes, toiletries, food and
water, in the event that what would be otherwise be a short stroll to a
nearby neighborhood in the City takes one or more long detours. He relies
solely on verbal or written directions from passersby to help him reach his
final destination: the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.

A component of Est=E9vez' penances consists of a handmade devotional guide
created at the Center for Book Arts in collaboration with artists Ana
Cordeiro and Amber McMillan. For information about this publication visit

For Arts Sake was hosted by Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and Franklin

Mailer's street smarts obviously didn't match his intellectual probing =
and
Jack Abbott provided embarrassing proof. I saw a photo of Abbott in one =
of
the men's magazines that interviewed him and saw the eyes of a =
cold-blooded
killer. But at one time I was a welfare worker and the two of the =
clients
who threatened my life were arrested for The third guy got arrested for
aggravated assault. I learned what to look for. Mailer's failure to spot
this quality in Abbott was na=EFve, idiotic, and ultimately deadly. So =
much
for his personal success at becoming a "white negro." I have stronger =
words
from the street that would describe my opinion about the Abbott disaster
more accurately, but I want to get this posted.=20

Mailer could be an asshole, but possibly his worst moment came when he =
was
acting out of concern. He helped get Jack Henry Abbott out of prison. I
think Mailer saw Abbott as his=20
  Genet. Mailer was always coming up with pseudo existential sound =
bites. I
think Mailer wanted to be the literary equivalent of Sartre. He was fond =
of
the word evil. When he came to the National Press Club, I asked him if =
he
considered Gary Gilmore or Abbott to be evil men.=20
  He said he couldn't judge. That he wasn't God. For Mailer to say he =
wasn't
God was to display a degree of humility unusual for him.=20

  Thank you. Mailer was probing the extremes of experience, willfully
exploring the taboo throughout his career. To get to the kind of =
knowledge
he was seeking, one has to transgress morality. In fact, he laid the
groundwork for most of it in "Advertisements for Myself." I judge a =
writer's
writing, not his conduct. If I did otherwise, I'd eliminate Dostoevsky,
Pound, Celine, Burroughs, and many others, and it would be my loss.=20

since when were writers the voice of morality?

he wrote a book of poems which was terrible. The only book of his I ever
read all the way through was "Advertisements For Myself" which I liked =
at
the time. When I looked at it a few years ago, it seemed dated. Anyway,
one of his novels, I forget which one, has a passage in which the =
narrator
gets a rush out of stabbing his wife to death. A couple of years ago I
decided not to review an anthology in which the excerpt describing the
stabbing and the rush appeared. It seemed immoral in the worst sense,
especially since Mailer once did stab his real wife at the time who,
masochist that she was, declined to press charges even though she was
seriously injured. It may be that Mailer's other books or some of them
justified the public's tolerance of his worst side as a person. I just
don't know. Regards, Tom Savage

I could use a little help

I've got an invitation to read in the wonderful Nye Beach Writers Series
in Newport, Oregon, on Saturday,  Sept. 20, of  ‘08.  Now I need to find a
couple additional readings in the area to help pay the expenses of getting
there from Chicago.

Anyone around Portland, Corvallis, Eugene etc. with campus connections or
other suggestions, your assistance will be greatly appreciated.

If you have any suggestions or questions, just drop me a note off list.

Many thanks,

Charlie

Turning the channel to see what movie on during Keith Oberman when got in
last night and found Sean Hannity introducing a clip of himself and his old
"good friend" "Norman" having a discussion on the stupidity of the American
electorate according to N.M.  Mailer's thesis was that when language ceased
to grow, democracy began to fail.  It wasn't clear how language grows, nor
quite how it was being diminished, other than this was taken for granted.
"Dumbing down" being the term both agreed upon.  Mailer did concede to Sean
that some Republicans are not stupid at all.  He named Rove and Rumsfield as
examples.
It was one of those conversations in which an idea with some potential is
introduced by one person--in this case a writer, who it is assumed would be
very concerned about language ceasing to grow--and the effects of this--and
then the idea itself is allowed to cease to develop, because the writer
seems to take it for granted that all he has to do is say something for it
to be so. Not unlike the Rovian thesis that an Imperial Power creates its
own reality.

Mailer had a propensity for the over simplification of ideas, followed by
their massive inflation, much like taking a few stills from a film and
enlarging them to billboard size and claiming that they stood for some Great
Existential Truth.  (About America, most of the time.)

Written about a quarter century apart, there's a weird trajectory of his
Marilyn and Oswald books which brings them both into extreme closeup sharp
focus with the figure of John F Kennedy, and, for Marilyn, with Bobby also.
Instead of the Kennedys being the "wobbling pivot" at the center of
proliferating conspiracy effects spiraling out into galaxies, they become
the lynch pins which steady and explain everything.  Like Vincent Bugliosi,
Pozner, and a number of other recent authors of equally massive
door-stopping tomes dealing with the "lone assassin," Mailer finds no
conspiracy whatsoever, only a tiny, tawdry, incompetent and quasi-impotent
man jealous of a virile President.

With Mailer i used to wonder if he wasn't always playing to a very select
and fixed audience, into which he could bring ideas from "outside" as though
they were really almost his own, or, made "better" (in class terms as well)
and actually his own  by being expressed through him and his "analyses," and
so he could be hailed as not only the Great American Novelist but also a
Great Thinker, Hipster, Journalist, Politician, etc.  A Renaissance Man in
fact. He was always playing the Bad Boy for the Hamptons crowd and the New
York Review of Books.  If one follows many of his "moves," they tend to be
well after others had cleared the way.  The Beats made the Hipster possible,
Sartre and Genet (Cocteau being left out of the equation) made the
Author/Philosopher and the writer/criminal/martyr/saint possible, Capote,
Wolfe and Hunter Thompson made the Novelist/Journalist possible, Hemingway
made the brawling Great Writer possible and etc etc etc.  Susan Sontag made
some films, so, voila, Norman did also.
Whatever he did, he had a guaranteed audience and press for, always treating
him like their enfant terrible, always treating his "existential" and
"psychological" "insights" as signs of genius and his every word a sign post
towards the Great American Novel he was going to produce some day.

A strange aspect of the Abbott case, is that Mailer seemed to think, like
certain schools of thought in the prison system, that a person like Abbott
can really be "changed," "saved," by the good will of others.  I imagine
Abbott saw a golden opportunity in Mailer, the perfect mark.  All he had to
do was play along for a while with Mailer's vision of Abbott, then the
actual Abbott could go on about the business of being Abbott rather than
someone else's projection on to him.  In a sense it is a revolt of a
person--let alone a person supposed to be a writer themselves-- against
becoming a character in someone else's drama,someone else's narrative and
its need for this particular type of role to be played to fulfill that
writer's vision of his own destiny.
Just because one practices what one considers a form of immense largesse
does not mean that a bite will not come back on to the hand that presumes to
feed it.

Scan Sonnet

Consider a scan without memory or data-base; each element of a scene ap-
pears independently, disconnected - chosen elements and their aura exist
in a now blurred by organism and technology. Isn't this the proper view of
eternity, holstered and silenced forever?

Consider a scan of the address or token of a scene element, and the total-
ity of such scans, re/creating a database of pointers towards an imaginary
real. In spite of ordering, their contents are empty. This is the proper
order of mass-consumption, enumerated and imminent.

Between consumption and eternity lies the wasteland.

To perceive is to process is to scan. To scan is to remember. To remember
constitutes both address and content. To remember is protocol.

If I am ill and am constituted by fever, what am I scanning? If I am de-
pressed, what am I thinking? Where are the ghosts of the real? In fever I
say: the real is always haunted. And in depression: Haunting is the real.

Who indeed?

And Lynda, just the other day, explaining in
Spanish why she'd fallen behind on a walk,
said, "Tengo piedras cortas." File it under SSL.

Still, we work on our Spanish every day.

Mailer wrote very well when he focused on criminality. "The American Dream" was a ruthless, fine crime novel. "Tough Guy's Don't Dance" was very good if you could ignore the final 100 pages. "The Executioner's Song" was excellent. There, Mailer allowed the Gilmore story to play itself out with NO DOPEY COMMENTARY. Perhaps if he hadn't had 6 wives, readers such as myself would have been spared the Marylin travesty, or worse, his interview with Madonna. Lawyers, alimony, expensive stuff.  For the most part, I enjoyed the guys writing. His poetry, the little he wrote, was pathetic. Most of his journalism is repetitive, bombastic, and, gosh, just not that good. But he had his moments. He made large claims. He occasionally lived up to them.

We live online between the black river and the great
depthless lake. Power lines skitter across our
periphery, trying not to be noticed, but failing for
all of that: I wake to take pills and cigarettes into
these transformations; I wake to literature of the
ripple and lap of the riverbank.

I'm still there throwing rocks out of the house I was
evicted from.

Down on the street where the babies shine, proper
nouns flourish. Serious health risks may develop if
you take this product with caffeine. Force a
misbehaving application to quit, and by this time
she's listening to music; below my feet, below the
floor, bass winds narcotic sinews around sense.
Sometimes I think all any of you want is to hear
pretty talk and sleep within soft logic, like babies.
In November we enter the season of howling land. Winds
pick up banshees and screams can be heard winding
narcotic sinews around sense. Thing is, I'm an uptown
man myself. I love to stand still vibrating at the
speed of your brain and my brain combined. There's
always a first step into the woods at night.

_Deviations_

               Before dawn
		in the thunderclap
	below the sheets or over head
	the form of a firefly
 	deviating,
		the whole vanishes – opening
             eyes apart
		the body moves
	a growing distant view
		pavement, puddles
	seeing raindrops from overhead
		separations
	sudden blindness
	      a set of pictures
                     blurring
		the goddess moves her mouth
			between her teeth –
		minds collide.

*Freedom Writ Large*

*This is John Pilger's address to a London meeting, 'Freedom Writ Large',
organized by PEN <http://www.englishpen.org/> and the Writers Network of
Burma, on October 25.*

*By John Pilger

10/27/07 "**ICH* <http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/>*' -- -- T*hank
you PEN for asking me to speak at this very important meeting tonight. I
join you in paying tribute to Burma's writers, whose struggle is almost
beyond our imagination. They remind us, once again, of the sheer power of
words. I think of the poets Aung Than and Zeya Aung. I think of U Win Tin, =
a
journalist, who makes ink out of brick powder on the walls of his prison
cell and writes with a pen made from a bamboo mat =96 at the age of 77. The=
se
are the bravest of the brave.

And what honor they bring to humanity with their struggle; and what shame
they bring to those whose hypocrisy and silence helps to feed the monster
that rules Burma.

I had planned tonight to read from my last interview with Aung San Suu Kyi,
but I decided not to =96 because of something Suu Kyi said to me when I las=
t
spoke to her. "Be careful of media fashion," she said. "The media like this
sentimental version of life that reduces everything down to personality. To=
o
often this can be a distraction."

I thought about that, and how typically self effacing she was, and how righ=
t
she was.

In my view, the greatest distraction is the hypocrisy of those political
figures in the democratic West, who claim to support the Burmese liberation
struggle. Laura Bush and Condoleezza Rice come to mind.
"The United States," said Rice, "is determined to keep an international
focus on the travesty that is taking place in Burma."

What she is less keen to keep a focus on is that the huge American company,
Chevron, on whose board of directors she sat, is part of a consortium with
the junta and the French company, Total, that operates in Burma's offshore
oil fields. The gas from these fields is exported through a pipeline that
was built with forced labor and whose construction involved Halliburton, of
which Vice President Cheney was Chief Executive.

For many years, the Foreign Office in London promoted business as usual in
Burma. When I interviewed Suu Kyi I read her a Foreign Office press release
that said, "Through commercial contacts with democratic nations such as
Britain, the Burmese people will gain experience of democratic principles."

She smiled sardonically and said, "Not a bit of it."

In Britain, the official public relations line has changed, but the
substance of compliance and collusion has not. British tour firms =96 like
Orient Express and Asean Explorer =96 are able to make a handsome profit on
the suffering of the Burmese people. Aquatic =96 a sort of mini Halliburton=
 =96
has its snout in the same trough, together with Rolls Royce and all those
posh companies that make a nice earner from Burmese teak.

When the last month's uprising broke out, Gordon Brown referred to the
sanctity of what he called "universal principles of human rights". He has
said something similar a letter sent to this meeting tonight. It is his
theme of distraction. I urge you not be distracted.

When did Brown or Blair ever use their close connections with business =96
their platforms at the CBI and in the City London =96 to name and shame the=
se
companies that make money on the back of the Burmese people? When did a
British prime minister call for the European Union to plug the loopholes of
arms supply to Burma, stopping, for example, the Italians from supplying
military equipment? The reason no doubt is that the British government is
itself one of the world's leading arms suppliers, especially to regimes at
war. Tonight (October 25) the Brown government has approved the latest
American prelude to its attack on Iran and the ensuing horror and bloodshed=
.

When did a British prime minister call on its ally and client, Israel, to
end its long and sinister relationship with the Burmese junta. Or does
Israel's immunity and impunity also cover its supply of weapons technology
to Burma and its reported training of the junta's most feared internal
security thugs? Of course, that is not unusual. The Australian government =
=96
so vocal lately in its condemnation of the junta =96 has not stopped the
Australian Federal Police from training Burma's internal security forces in
at the Australian-funded Center for Law Enforcement Cooperation in
Indonesia.

There are many more of these grand, liberal hypocrites; and we who care for
freedom in Burma should not be distracted by the posturing and weasel
pronouncements of our leaders, who themselves should be called to account a=
s
accomplices =96 unless and until their fine words are matched by deeds that
make a genuine difference and they themselves stop destroying lives. We owe
that vigilance and that truth to Aung San Suu Kyi, to Burma's writers and t=
o
all the other bravest of the brave.

For folks with interest in Lawrence Weiner - text/concrete poetry/ conceptual artist, etc., whose first work emerged in the late sixties - Roberta Smith has a good review plus photographs of his retrospective recently opened at the Whitney. Though Weiner is deeply into language/thought and the implications of  text  explored - almost in the manner of paint and/or sculpture -  in the context of gallery and public spaces - it is a good bet that Weiner's work is rarely studied in the context of most MFA writing programs. (Ron Silliman recently explored this sad poverty in a recent essay on the fate of consideration (lack thereof) of contemporary concrete poets.)

 For those in New York or visiting there is a nice permanent Weiner text piece on the crossbeam of an old Federal house on Greenwich near Canal Street. I have a picture and discussion of it on my blog from earlier this year:

Call for Work <http://nccmailart.blogspot.com/2007/11/call-for-work.html>

Call for Work - Calling all Artists

The making of mail as art, "mail art" has a history stretching back at least
to the 1950s. Mail art has in the past rooted in a rejection of the commerce
and exclusivity of the gallery show. The making of mail art, "mail-art"
continues to be a common practice in an age dominated by electronic
communication. This exhibition will continue to break down the division
between the mailbox and the gallery. To that end, Niagara County Community
College Art Gallery is seeking submissions for an upcoming exhibition,
aiming to display the myriad manifestations of mail art. Artists working in
all media are encouraged to participate. The topic and content of each piece
is solely the choice of the artist. Artists are asked to produce one piece
of mail art and send it to guest curator Becky Moda. Your work will be
displayed in a cataloged group exhibition in the Spring. After the
exhibition closes, each participating artist will receive via mail the work
of another artist. "Senders receive," as mail artists say.

The mail art movement is uniquely populist and non-commercial, involving
non-traditional distribution methods and the potential for global reach.
Let's breathe new life into this fascinating movement, which predated and in
some ways predicted the artist networking boom enabled by the internet.

It is asked that the artists adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please send one piece of mail art to: Mail Art, NCCC Gallery, Niagara
County Community College, 3111 Saunders Settlement Road, Sanborn, New York
14132-9460 by February 14, 2008.

2. The mail art can take any shape, in two or three dimensions. Pieces can
expand when opened, but must be easily re-mailed for less than five dollars.


Email any questions to beckymoda@gmail.com

Dan Raphael is known for the linguistic richness of his poetry and his
energetic performance of those words. Breath Test, his 16th book, was
published this May (nine muses books.); other books include Showing
Light a Good Time and When a Flying City Falls. Dan's poems have
appeared in such publications as Central Park, Caliban, UrVox, Shattered
Wig, and Tinfish, while current works appear in Otoliths, Skidrow
Penthouse, Broken Word II, 31, and Refined Savage. His monthly poetry
series at a downtown bookstore is in its 13th year; he previously edited
26 Books and NRG Magazine.

Rodney Koeneke is the author of the poetry collections Musee Mechanique
(BlazeVOX, 2006) and Rouge State (Pavement Saw, 2003). His new
manuscript is called Etruria. Hobbies include flarf and neo-benshi, both
of which will figure in this reading, where parts of a silent classic
film will be screened to the poet's script. Rodney feeds almost daily
content to his poetry blog, http://www.modampo.blogspot.com, and has
flash-reviewed 100 poetry books for his latest time sink, GoodReads.
Rodney lives in Portland with his wife, Lesley Poirier, and their
curly-headed son.

 Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies 25: Bomb Iran Follies
 Hilton Obenzinger

 I write these meditations from time to time in an attempt to stay
sane.  If you find them tedious, apply the magic of delete.  If you
want to share them with others, feel free to do so.

 November 12, 2007

 ------------------

 When Bush pushed for further sanctions against Iran, Vladimir Putin
asked a semi-rhetorical question: "Why make the situation worse, bring
it to a dead end, threaten sanctions or even military action?"

 This reminds me of the bumper sticker I see sometimes: "WAR IS NOT THE ANS=
WER."

 Of course, war IS the answer if the question is how to dominate the
Middle East, control the flow of oil, put a stranglehold on Europe and
Japan, encircle Russia . . . and so forth. And why make the situation
worse?  Because targeting Iran and spreading the chaos in the Middle
East is part of the plan.

 As the Bush gang continues the slide towards widening the war, the
absurdities keep mounting. Israel bombs something in Syria =96 a big
cube in the desert =96 which is or may be or could be a nuclear reactor.
One country bombs another =96 and the US does not object, and there's
little outrage. Instead, the Bush gang encourages speculation in the
media about exactly in what way the cube is a dangerous nuclear
threat.

 The man who spends his time inspecting to see if a country is
building nuclear weapons, Mohamed ElBaradei, thought that "to bomb
first and ask questions later" was peculiar. Then the press discovers
that pictures of that cube in the desert have been around for years.
Why bomb it now? Did it just become a threat? Doesn't the fact that no
one finds any evidence by Israel or the US a little dubious? Haven't
we learned something from the last bit of faith-based intelligence?

 Don't get me wrong. I don't want Syria to make nuclear weapons, nor
Iran. But Israel has not signed the non-proliferation treaty, and Iran
has. Besides, Israel has, according to the CIA, over 200 nuclear
weapons =96 but Israel's no problem, according to the US. Pakistan has
nuclear bombs and is coming apart at the seams =96 but Pakistan's still
our ally. Iran and Syria are the problems. Imagine if Syria's air
force bombed Dimona, Israel's reactor. It's hard to conceive how much
of an uproar that would produce, not to mention massive military
retaliation.

 But, wait, there's more. Kurdish rebels attack Turkish troops on the
border between Turkey and Iraq. Turkey threatens to retaliate. The US
condemns the Kurdish "terrorists" and asks the Iraqi Kurds to cool
them out. Meanwhile, Kurdish rebels on the border between Iraq and
Iran continue their attacks =96 but, of course, they're not terrorists.

 Remember: some people can have nuclear weapons but others can't; some
Kurds are terrorists but others are not; peace means war or is it war
means peace? No need to fret, democracy in the Middle East is
Blackwater electing to decide which is which. Norman Podhoretz is
panting for World War 4 (apparently we already had number 3 =96 I'm glad
I missed it); Giuliani has brought on Podhoretz and other fanatics to
guide his campaign to ready the trigger on "Islamo-fascism."
Meanwhile, the Bush gang keeps waterboarding the Democrats, making
them think they're going to drown until they gag and . . . then they
do drown in the bodily fluids of their own cowardice. Even if Bush
doesn't bomb Iran, he's making sure that whoever takes over will have
to do the job.

 Oh, yes, then there's the latest case of tainted toys from China.
Congress votes more money for the agency checking consumer goods to
expand, get more inspectors, do its job, and the director says she
doesn't want the dough: Regulation is bad. Health care for kids is
nixed =96 too expensive, plus it's socialism. And how can I forget: Bush
threatens Cuba; Gaza is a giant prison and starving to death; veterans
make up 25 percent of the homeless and are treated like dirt, not by
anti-war protesters yelling "baby killers" but by the government that
sent them; Lou Dobbs and other media demagogues vilify immigrants; and
one more celebrity apologizes for a racist outburst.

 So, remember this moment. Remember all of the absurdities. Add some
that I've missed.

 And start making up excuses to the future generations for why we
allowed all of this to happen.

AN OFT-NEGLECTED FACT OF WORLD FILM history is that nearly everywhere
movies have been regularly shown there was an era in which they were
accompanied by live narration by "movietellers." Movietelling ranged
from simultaneous translation of a foreign film and introductory
lectures on its cultural background--for example, explaining "cowboys
and Indians" to audiences in 1910s East Asia--to original new scripts
in which each character was impersonated and sound effects recreated
by a single performer freely departing from the film's originally
intended message.

SOMETIMES CALLED "POETS OF THE DARK," in colonized countries, the
movieteller retold officially approved films in ways that expressed
the local community's anguish and resistance. In doing so, they
mastered many modes of political wit, satire, lyricism, narrative
rhythm, and melodrama. Not surprisingly, movietellers were often
arrested in the midst of a performance.

THIS SATURDAY AT THE MIAMI BEACH CINEMATHEQUE, Kate Ann Heidelbach,
Jen Nellis, and dennis M. somera--three wonderful poets from the San
Francisco Bay Area and Miami who took seminars I taught at Mills
College and the University of Miami--will be performing the first
movietelling in Miami in nearly a century. I will also give an
introductory illustrated talk and present excerpts from my own work
in this genre going back to the early 1980s. You are hereby
guaranteed a unique, thoroughly enjoyable and illuminating evening
that will make you see the film-going experience from a rich new
perspective!

Howdy friends -

This evening, Saturday November 17, I will be hosting a poetry reading
at my home in Chapel Hill NC (map: http://tinyurl.com/yoganf) to which
you are all invited.  I am hosting this reading in celebration of the
arrival of Murat along with three of the greatest Turkish poets alive
today, Lale Müldür, Gaven Tran and Seyhan Erözçelik.  It is my aim to
share some of our best poetry with our distinguished Turkish visitors.

Readers:

Murat Nemet-Nejat
residing in Hoboken, NJ; originally from Istanbul, Turkey
http://google.com/search?q=murat+nemet-nejat

Standard Schaefer
residing in San Francisco, CA; originally from Houston, Texas

My door will open to everyone around 9PM and we will start readings
promptly at 10. Each reader will read 10-30 minutes, and around 11:30 we
will screen two films. The film _Satori Uso_
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkkNV77h28) is based on a character by
Rodrigo Garcia Lopes. The second film is Julian Semilian's new
surrealist short film, _Tear Void Insomnia Mist_.  If you don't know
him, Julian is an all-around brilliant poet/filmmaker/artist
(http://tinyurl.com/yw5bmz) who teaches at the NC School of the Arts in
Winston-Salem, NC.

(special request: please park on the street, as my driveway is very
treacherously steep and difficult to turn around on; there's a nicely
lit brick stair-walk leading to my front door from the stret)

there will be snacks there will, there will be snacks

Earlier today I was reading in the park before going to my stupid job.
 A pair of nannies arrived on the scene with 2 young boys, one dressed
as a cowboy, the other as an indian.

"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DROP DEAD WHEN I SHOOT YOU!"

"WHY DO I HAVE TO DIE ALL THE TIME!?"

"BECAUSE I'M THE COWBOY AND COWBOYS DON'T DIE THE INDIANS DIE!"

"I DON'T WANNA BE AN INDIAN NO MORE!  I'M TIRED OF DYING ALL THE TIME!"

The nannies sat on a bench smoking and talking about boyfriends.  It
was just another day in Philadelphia celebrating the murderous world
we wake yawning toward.

What fucking parents in 2007 are buying kids cowboy and indian
costumes with cap guns?  WHAT IF young German boys wanted to play a
game of NAZI and JEW!?  WOULD THAT ALSO BE OKAY!?  But then again the
Germans lost the war.  Maybe if the indians won the war the cowboys
would die in the game?

What the fuck are these fucking parents thinking?  "Let's get the boys
some cowboy and indian outfits like we had when we were kids!  Ah,
look at them shoot one another!  Brings back memories!"

Our country is about to celebrate THANKSGIVING DAY, again!  Talk about
nostalgia for genocide.

How many Americans will mindlessly cook a butchered turkey without any
thought of Native American bloodlines having been erased from the
planet?  Millions and millions of tortured, slaughtered families from
every corner of our map.  All 50 states experienced this slaughter,
enslavement, this giant dark finger tamping out the lights of
generations.  Languages stuttered into the plains and mountain chains
no more.

And who will be thinking of the nearly ONE MILLION Iraqis killed since
our unprovoked illegal invasion of Iraq?  THANKSGIVING DAY!?

WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING DAY!?

FUCK THANKSGIVING DAY!

For those interested, a campaign to fast on Thanksgiving Day has
begun.  For more information please go to this site:
http://THANKSGIVINGDAYFAST.blogspot.com

When genocide is part of playtime everyone's asleep and murdering by
proxy, even your stupid fucking children who know no better,

TINFISH PRESS NEWS

During this past year, Tinfish Press has published the following:

--two on-line features at tinfishpress.com (About Looking and Tinfish
Net #3 , On Translation)
--farout_library_software by Pam Brown (Australia) and Maged Zaher
(Seattle/Cairo) (Design by Chae Ho Lee)
--Corpse Watching by Sarith Peou (design by Lian Litvin)
--Someday I'll Be Sitting at a Dingy Bar by Hwang Jiwoo, translated by
Scott Swaner and Young-Jun Lee (design by Gaye Chan)
--Language as Responsibility by Leonard Schwartz (design by Lian Litvin)
--Tinfish #17, the annual journal of poetry from the Pacific, featuring
poetry from Hawai`i and elsewhere (covers by Jean Pittman)

Forthcoming (soon!)

--The Erotics of Geography (with cd-rom) by Hazel Smith (design by Karen
Zimmerman)

Forthcoming (later!)

(First) books of poems by Craig Santos Perez and Meg Withers.

A group of us just read and presented design talks at Evergreen State
University in Olympia, Washington (Leonard Schwartz's class) and at
Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon (organized by Jules Boykoff
and Kaia Sand, among others). The reception was warm and engaged.
Readers included Tiare Picard, Craig Perez, Deborah Meadows, Lissa
Wolsak, Lisa Kanae and Susan M. Schultz. Approximately 200 people showed
up for the reading at Pacific University and many dozens more for Gaye
Chan and Lian Litvin's design talk. You can see photos at the “friends
of Tinfish Press” facebook page.

This past April we sponsored a reading by Linh Dinh and Naomi Long in
Honolulu. In early November, we celebrated Tinfish #17 with a reading in
the UH English department.

Please check our website for more details: http://tinfishpress.com

We invite you to buy Tinfish books. They make wonderful gifts for lovers
of poetry and design, especially. To buy a Tinfish book is also to
support the making of more fine books.

We intend to publish more fine books in the coming year, and to offer
readings here (Hawai`i) and elsewhere. So we also invite you to make tax
deductible donations to Tinfish, either on the website or at our address:

Baroque Threads by Donald Wellman

from Notebook: Cuaderno de Costa Rica

Donald Wellman teaches cultural studies and writing at Daniel Webster
College. Fields, a selected poems, spanning twenty years of work, appeared
in 1995 (Light and Dust). Wellman has translated from French, German, and
Spanish. Currently he is working with the Spanish poet Antonio Gamoneda.
As editor of O.ARS, a series of anthologies devoted to postmodern poetics
and practices, he derived personal satisfaction from the use of
punctuation a la dada. The selection here is from his Notebook: Cuaderno
de Costa Rica. His poetry engages emerging identities from an ethnographic
perspective. These projects include Diario mexicano, Oaxaca, and Prolog
Pages. Excerpts from these projects can be found in various on-line and
print media: Eratio Postmodern Poetry, There, and Fascicle among others.
His essay, "Creeley's Ear," appeared in Jacket Magazine 31. His "Prose on
Uxmal" will be found in the current Absent Magazine. "Your Sleep is a
Closed Almond," from Yvan Goll's Traumkraut, appears in Circumference 5
(Fall 2006). Other translations from Goll appear in the current Calque.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

I don't think anyone is celebrating genocide. Calling Thanksgiving a
celebration of genocide not only weakens what genocide is --planned,
systematic annihilation-- but seems exaggerative. I agree that the roots of
the celebration itself are suspect, but how is the view you express
different from the Crazy Christians seeking to ban Halloween?

It must be so wearying to be so conscientious that you feel compelled to monitor the play of children as they try to fit themselves into becoming human beings.  Haven't we all played games as children that we would be embarrassed by if we considered ourselves to be perfect human specimens, complete and not subject to any form of error.

As a child, as an adult, I was and am far from perfect.  As a child I killed living beings wantonly (just as Gloucester notices in Lear).  As an adult I live under a governmental and social-economic complex that does vile things in my name every time I drop a dollar at the local store.  Every single one of us typing into this list-serve is compromised by every light or other electrical switch we turn on.  Put that into your rant pipe and smoke it!

Leave the children alone! It's the adults we have to try to change.

Earlier today I was reading in the park before going to my stupid job.
A pair of nannies arrived on the scene with 2 young boys, one dressed
as a cowboy, the other as an indian.

"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DROP DEAD WHEN I SHOOT YOU!"

"WHY DO I HAVE TO DIE ALL THE TIME!?"

"BECAUSE I'M THE COWBOY AND COWBOYS DON'T DIE THE INDIANS DIE!"

"I DON'T WANNA BE AN INDIAN NO MORE!  I'M TIRED OF DYING ALL THE TIME!"

The nannies sat on a bench smoking and talking about boyfriends.  It
was just another day in Philadelphia celebrating the murderous world
we wake yawning toward.

What fucking parents in 2007 are buying kids cowboy and indian
costumes with cap guns?  WHAT IF young German boys wanted to play a
game of NAZI and JEW!?  WOULD THAT ALSO BE OKAY!?  But then again the
Germans lost the war.  Maybe if the indians won the war the cowboys
would die in the game?

What the fuck are these fucking parents thinking?  "Let's get the boys
some cowboy and indian outfits like we had when we were kids!  Ah,
look at them shoot one another!  Brings back memories!"

Our country is about to celebrate THANKSGIVING DAY, again!  Talk about
nostalgia for genocide.

How many Americans will mindlessly cook a butchered turkey without any
thought of Native American bloodlines having been erased from the
planet?  Millions and millions of tortured, slaughtered families from
every corner of our map.  All 50 states experienced this slaughter,
enslavement, this giant dark finger tamping out the lights of
generations.  Languages stuttered into the plains and mountain chains
no more.

And who will be thinking of the nearly ONE MILLION Iraqis killed since
our unprovoked illegal invasion of Iraq?  THANKSGIVING DAY!?

Dear All,
Robin Purves and I are delighted to announce the publication of the
following book, available now. Apologies for cross-posting.
Yours truly,
Sam


COMPLICITIES: British Poetry 1945-2007
eds. Robin Purves & Sam Ladkin


ISBN 978-80-7308-194-2 (paperback). 261pp.
Publication date: November 2007

Price: =80 12.00 (not including postage)


http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/complicities.html


This collection of essays does not seek to fashion a bespoke
21st-century Albion from the remnants of Britain's various poetic
traditions. The poetry considered here, and its criticism too, is by
and large critical of the "new imperial suitings" beneath which the
old and new networks of power run. The work gathered in these pages
knows language and culture to be profoundly complicit across the board
in the extension of acts of domination, from the preparation for and
execution of war, to the composition of the suicide note, from the
overt corrupting of the democratic franchise, to cold calling's
interpellation of the human subject as consumer-in-waiting.

Contributors to this volume include: Thomas Day, Keston Sutherland,
Alizon Brunning, Robin Purves, J.H. Prynne, Bruce Stewart, D.S.
Marriott, Stephen Thomson, Craig Dworkin, Sophie Read, Sara Crangle,
Malcolm Phillips, Tom Jones, Josh Robinson, Sam Ladkin, Jennifer
Cooke, Ian Patterson.

Robin Purves is a Lecturer in English Literature at the University of
Central Lancashire.

Sam Ladkin is a researcher at the University of Cambridge.

Maybe you didn't notice that I was referring to the adults?  It was
the adults I blamed, not the children.  In fact I made a point of
saying the children know no better.

What children do and say frightens me BECAUSE it's what the adults
they mimic do and say.  Get it?

We're at war and nearly a million Iraqis are dead.  Thanksgiving makes
me sick at this point.  Literally sick!

As far as being told I'm exaggerating genocide, no.  No I'm not.  It's
on historical record that the Puritans were not at all interested in
sharing space, resources, or much else with Native Americans.  Roger
Williams made it clear that he and his fellow Puritans should at the
very least PAY the Native Americans for the land being settled, and it
was this reason as much as any other reason Williams was sent into
exile.  He dared look upon the Native Americans as equals, and was
banished.  He then founded Providence, Rhode Island.  But no, it's no
exaggeration at all to link the original white settlers with genocide.

Many people like to entertain the notion that the Indian Wars were
post Civil War, when in fact the original white settlers starved
entire Native American communities out of their homes and off their
land.  The very same white settlers the Native Americans rescued when
first arriving.  That's no exaggeration either to say "rescued,"
because if it were not for the Native Americans sharing food and
resources The Mayflower would be unknown to us today.

And not only that but our first president himself declared war on the
Iroquois.  Washington became known as "Village Destroyer."  The
slaughter he unleashed continued for a hundred more years, up to the
massacre at Wounded Knee.  The photographs of that mass grave of
Lakota men, women and children should make anyone sick to their
stomachs.  The US 7th Cavalry standing at the edge of the grave with
their rifles, posing above the twisted and bloody limbs, it's
incredible!  And THAT photograph should be in every single high school
history book!

If the Native Americans who rescued the settlers from the Mayflower
had any idea what was to come, the evil, wicked, wanton destruction
and murder, would they have fed these people?  I like to think they
would have let them starve.

What I'm proposing is a Thanksgiving Day of giving thanks by saying NO!

And being a vegetarian for 20 years (January 1st 2008 it will be 20
years) I also point out that the lives of turkeys are also very much
on my mind.  Having grown up in rural America I've known turkeys both
domesticated and wild, and love the birds.  They are amazing creatures
with fascinating lives.  The care of a mother turkey, the ritual of a
Tom defending his turf, and a million nuances outside the obvious,
make me wonder how many people stuffing their faces with the flesh of
these birds ever care to know how they live.

I've always admired the Abbie Hoffman quote, "I believe in compulsory
cannibalism.  If people were forced to eat what they killed, there
would be no more wars."

i agree. thanksgiving is one of my favorite rituals in american culture. it's all about appreciating what you have and looking out for people who have less. and while the history may not back it up, the thanksgiving mythology reflects an attitude that I think culturally we can be proud of and i'm hesitant to toss the baby out with the bathwater on that one.

I get that this is something that you are passionate about, and couldn't agree more that the treatment of the native american nations by european colonists was an atrocity that our nation is a long way from fully making amends for. Not only that, but I'm sympathetic to your feelings about animal rights. I'm not a vegetarian myself, because the arguments for that level of ethical responsibility to non-human lifeforms are not something that I think holds water. I am however disgusted by the practices of factory meat production in the country and for many years have endeavored to keep my diet as close to the principle of local sustainablity as I can. The older I get, and the more money I have, the better I've gotten at it. Further many of my dearest friends are strict vegans and for a number of years I've enjoyed the fellowship of sitting down to at one particular family's table on thanksgiving to enjoy the completely animal-product-free meal with them.

I'm telling you all this because I want you to know that while I'm sympathetic to your cause, frankly I find your tactics extremely offputting and my gut reaction to them is to pull away, delete the email and ignore what you're saying. I'm not doing that because I don't think that gets anybody anywhere. I'd like to ask you to consider not what you're asking people to do, but how you're asking them to do it, and also to consider what the symbolic nature of what you're asking to do is asking people to give up.

I won't be fasting with you on Thanksgiving day. As I said on a previous email, the mythology and ritual of the holiday means far too much to me and honestly I don't see what participating in your protest would accomplish. But I want to hear what you have to say, and I think it's important that you continue to say it. However, I don't know that many other people will react to you that way unless you find a better way of saying it.

Sincerely,
Jason Quackenbush

note:  the issue 13 relies exclusively on javascript.  there is nothing to
see without javascript enabled.  that said, i have only tested it for
Firefox 2 (and if you're not using firefox, you really should be:
http://getfirefox.com), so, if you have the time, please fire up IE or
Safari or Opera, and let me know if there are any problems, specifically if
your computer slows down significantly after viewing a page of issue 13 for
more than three minutes (I suspect a memory leak in some of my programming
-- I had all seven pages open for half an hour and it slowed my Core 2 w/
2Gigs ram, so there's no telling how bad it will be on slower computers
running bloated virus/spyware/adware sentries).

Anyhow, I will appreciate any and all technical reports.  I am just a
hobbyist programmer/designer -- don't have access to six different browsers.

Also, it's absolutely beautiful.  Check it out: http://listenlight.net.  You
will love it.

Your happy editor --

ur country is about to celebrate THANKSGIVING DAY, again!  Talk about
ostalgia for genocide.
How many Americans will mindlessly cook a butchered turkey without any
hought of Native American bloodlines having been erased from the
lanet?  Millions and millions of tortured, slaughtered families from
very corner of our map.  All 50 states experienced this slaughter,
nslavement, this giant dark finger tamping out the lights of
enerations.  Languages stuttered into the plains and mountain chains
o more.
And who will be thinking of the nearly ONE MILLION Iraqis killed since
ur unprovoked illegal invasion of Iraq?  THANKSGIVING DAY!?
WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING DAY!?
FUCK THANKSGIVING DAY!
For those interested, a campaign to fast on Thanksgiving Day has
egun.  For more information please go to this site:
ttp://THANKSGIVINGDAYFAST.blogspot.com
When genocide is part of playtime everyone's asleep and murdering by
roxy, even your stupid fucking children who know no better,

Art Theory Now: from Aesthetics to Aesthesis

Johanna Drucker

School of Visual Arts: Tuesday, December 11, 7pm

Amphitheater
209 East 23rd Street, 3rd floor, free and open to the public
If the job of art criticism is interpretation, the task of art theory is to
offer foundational principles for understanding the identity and cultural
function of works of art. But what aesthetic theory accommodates Damien
Hirst=B9s In the Name of God, Phil Collins=B9 The World Won=B9t Listen, Jennifer
Steinkamp=B9s digital video works, the books of Dean Dass, or Robert Longo=B9s
drawings of deep space or atomic blasts? How do we formulate aesthetic
theory after Adorno? This lecture outlines a shift from aesthetics as the
study of objects to aesthesis as a mode of experience and knowledge, and
draws on ideas sketched in the author's recent article, "Making Space:
Image-Events in an Extreme State," published in Cultural Politics.

Johanna Drucker is Robertson Professor of Media Studies at the University o=
f
Virginia and the author of Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity
(University of Chicago, 2006) and The Century of Artists' Books (Granary,
2004). Presented by the MFA Art Criticism and Writing Department.

ULF STOLTERFOHT
Lingos I-IX
translated from the German by Rosmarie Waldrop
Poetry, 128 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-85-8 original paperback $14
Publication date: November 15, 2007

Lingos takes as its playground all the cultural baggage of our turn =20
of the century and examines it with a mix of deconstruction, parody =20
and sheer exuberance. The poems flaunt their intent to avoid =20
linearity, prefabricated meaning and the lyrical I. Instead, they =20
cultivate irony, punning, fragmenting, juxtaposing, distorting, and =20
subject everything to an almost compulsive humor =97 the author and his =20=

own methods included.

Ulf Stolterfoht was born in 1963 in Stuttgart and now lives in Berlin =20=

with his wife and three children. His 3 books of poems are all called =20=

Fachsprachen [lingos, jargons, technical terms] and are all published =20=

by Urs Engeler Editor:
FACHSPRACHEN I-IX (1998), FACHSPRACHEN X-XVIII (2002), which received =20=

the Hans-Erich-Nossack-F=F6rderpreis and the Christine Lavant-Preis =20
respectively, and most recently, in 2004, FACHSPRACHEN XIX-XXVII, for =20=

which he received the Anna-Seghers-Prize in 2005 and a stipendium to =20
the German Academy in Rome.

=93Let us only say, that Stolterfoht=92s poems have something I would =20=

count as new possibilities of poetry: an intellectual serenity that =20
is not just witty and satirical, but works with advanced poetic means =20=

and proves to be =E0 la hauteur of the satirized subjects.=94=97J=F6rg =
Drews, =20
Merkur

Hhere the entire history of philosophy and literature is first tossed =20=

into the waste basket before it is possibly reused.... But underneath =20=

it all, the author is in search of a serious and usuable poem, This =20
double bind, on the one hand to serve/use postmodern recycling and, =20
on the other, to make fun of it, is what I consider so =20
extraordinary.=94 =97Kurt Drawert, Neue Z=FCrcher Zeitung

For those of you lucky enough to catch the readings by or in honor of the
Turkish poets who took the area by storm this weekend know that it was a
moment
of extrordinary good fortune for poetry in this neck of the woods. But there
was
one reading that I can't stop thinking about, it was one of those
experiences
one does not have that often, I think Frank O'Hara may have had it when he
heard Billie Holliday at the 5 Spot, and that is the reading by Lale Muldur
of
her poem Virgin Mary's smoke, where, as the poem unfolded I certainly
stopped
breathing, and I think others in the room did as well. It is a poem that is
an
immense push back against a very dark force, that begins at a dauntingly
high
rhetorical pitch, evoking Rilke,

Every angel is cruel, 13 months
spent tied by Virgin ary's rope,
that leap moon year
terrible-I-don't-know-why angels
seperated us.
On the nineteenth week of my melancholy,
I got to recognize you . . .

and sustains it, not with grand flourishes, but with a clear cold eye
trained on
an adversary, melancholy, depression, some black hole not term does justice
to.
The poem takes us from abjection,

On a black satin sheet
I am tracing a gold cross for you.
Only this way can I express your absence


and slowly, steps forward, deeper into the mire, but with an ever increasing
clarity. Waywardness, seeming drift, reveal themselves to be an unerring
advance  into mythic naratives where the poet evokes with trememndous
sharpness
and consision the tradition of figurations of the divine feminine. (HD
troopers,
you know this terrain) How we get to the final and troublingly ecstatic, at
least I think its ecstatic, though on rereading it it seems less the triumph
it
did at the reading, where one could clearly feel not simply the witness of
one
who has suffered but as if the actual place where it transpired opened
before
one -- yes I can't help but think in Needian terms here!-- those last lines


lonesome . . . is it how it is?





You will say to them:


"I won't live in your town long . . ."


THEN LIKE A NAME


THEY'RE ENTERING A DIMENSIONLESS SPACE



how we get here, I'm still trying to figure. From the reading one came away
with
the dark but exalted feeling that this language, so artfully perched at the
edge
of an inviolable isolation, was recieving a charge from a place beyond it. I
think of the Sufic notion of the I that must be slain, so that the I that is
of
the divine can say itself. And of course such a trasnformation of the
personal,
the death of that I is symbolic but ir really does have to hurt, or so I
glean,
the death on some level has to be a real death. Muldur cited Rimbaud in a
statement at the beginning of the reading, I think it must have been his
voyant
letter, and her words made good on such a daunting and lets admit it
perilous
article of poetic faith.

Many thanks to Rob S, and Patrick, and Murat and everyone involved.

PS there will soon be a sampler from Murat's anthology EDA up at Jacket.
Well
worth a click on the screen. Even better, oh my pitchman soul, the book is
available, and can be purchased. What a great Christmas present! Eda, under
the
tree!

A Windfall Illuminates the Poetry Field, and Its Fights

Chris Ocken for The New York Times

IN November 2002, news of a $100 million grant from the pharmaceutical
company heiress Ruth Lilly to the Modern Poetry Association, publisher of
Poetry magazine, electrified the arts and philanthropic communities.

David Fenza, executive director of the Association of Writers and Writing
Programs, was serving on a National Endowment for the Arts grant panel at
the time and remembers being shocked by “administrators from all over the
world using the term ‘irresponsible philanthropy.’ ” In time, though, he
came to agree that “you don’t convey a two-ton load on a bicycle.”

The gift, now estimated to be worth $200 million, not only raised eyebrows,
but also incited envy among small poetry presses, organizations and
magazines. “The problem was, the field is so poor,” Mr. Fenza said. “It’s
safe to say the initial disappointment about the grant going all to one
entity was huge. “The fact that the Poetry board decided not to be a
grant-making organization just threw salt in the wound.”

Five years later, the verdict on the Lilly gift and the Chicago-based Poetry
Foundation, the Modern Poetry Association’s successor, is generally more
positive — though many still wish the money had been distributed more
widely, and some critics caution that popular poetry is not necessarily good
poetry.

The foundation’s accomplishments include a lively, award-winning Web site
with poetry podcasts and a poetry best-seller list, a reinvigorated
magazine, a set of unusual prizes and, in partnership with the N.E.A., the
Poetry Out Loud national high school recitation contest.

“On the surface, they’ve done very well in handling a gift of that
magnitude,” said Jim Sitter, a Minneapolis fund-raising consultant for
literary organizations. “It’s extraordinary that they’ve been able to adapt
and change without disturbing the reputation and quality of the magazine —
if anything, it perhaps has improved — and at the same time build a set of
other programs which take the long view.”

Dana Gioia, a poet who is chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
applauds the foundation for “reaching millions of people with poetry,” and
calls it “probably the only literary organization large enough to change the
national trends in poetry.”

Others, like the poet and critic J. D. McClatchy, argue that rendering
poetry suitable for mass consumption may be worse than cultural neglect. “If
you make poetry easier to read, does that make poetry better? Or is that
finally good for the readership?” Mr. McClatchy asked. “Poetry is supposed
to complicate people’s lives, not to reassure them, or to be a humorous
relaxation or an amusing spot on the radio.”

In line with its goal of raising poetry’s profile, the foundation has
sponsored poetry on television (broadcast on “The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer”)
and radio (through Garrison Keillor’s “Writer’s Almanac”), as well as in
newspapers (the syndicated column “American Life in Poetry,” by Ted Kooser,
a former poet laureate of the United States).

“It’s a wonderful opportunity for me to show people that poems aren’t
something that they have to be afraid of,” Mr. Kooser said.

In Chicago, the Poetry Foundation oversees a high-profile poetry series and
sponsors events with groups like the Guild Complex, the Art Institute of
Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Its Poetry in America survey,
with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago,
emphasized the importance of early involvement with poetry.

The foundation has announced the opening of the Harriet Monroe Poetry
Institute, named for Poetry magazine’s founder. The institute, partnering
with the Aspen Institute, will identify ways of strengthening poetry and
expanding its audience, said Anne Halsey, a foundation spokeswoman. The
foundation has also selected a Chicago firm to design a 25,000-square-foot
downtown office scheduled for completion in 2010.

Tree Swenson, executive director of the Academy of American Poets in New
York, says she finds many of the foundation’s plans admirable but wishes
that the organization would “use the money to leverage additional funding
for the entire field” from other nonprofit groups through mechanisms like
challenge grants.

Mr. McClatchy said he was “dubious about some of the awards” given by the
foundation, notably the naming of a Children’s Poet Laureate and the Mark
Twain Poetry Award for humorous poetry, both of which come with $25,000
grants. “They just don’t seem to be worth the money,” he said.

The foundation’s president, John Barr, an investment banker who has written
half a dozen books of poetry, has aroused particular ire. “What puzzles many
of us,” said Mr. Fenza of the Association of Writers and Writing Programs,
“is that there seems to be a disconnect between the pluralism of Poetry
Foundation programming and John Barr’s advocacy for a particular kind of
poetry. I call it prairie populism.”

In a September 2006 essay in Poetry, Mr. Barr bemoaned the “intellectual and
spiritual stagnation” of contemporary poetry, took university writing
programs to task for fostering “a climate of careerism” and called for poets
to “live broadly, then write boldly.” The reaction was fierce. In a letter
published in Poetry, Robert Wrigley, a poet and professor at the University
of Idaho, called the essay “insipid” and said “the idea that teachers are by
virtue of their employment in the academy not part of the general life of
the culture is a canard.”

(Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Barr declined to comment for this article.)

That Mr. Barr has become a polarizing figure dismays those who sympathize
with his goals. H. Peter Karoff, a poet who is founder and chairman of the
Philanthropic Initiative, says he has long believed that poetry was
“underutilized, underrecognized and undermarketed.” Thanks in part to the
Poetry Foundation, he said, “I see evidence that there is more of a presence
of poetry in the society.”

As for Mr. Barr, however, Mr. Karoff said: “I’m not big into a leadership
style where the leader becomes the story. I think it’s diversionary to the
goals and mission of an organization.”

Mr. Gioia, whose influential 1991 manifesto “Can Poetry Matter?” was cited
in Mr. Barr’s essay, called both Mr. Barr’s commentary and the blistering
reaction “unfortunate.” As N.E.A. chairman, Mr. Gioia said that he would
never attack an arts organization, and he added that he thought Mr. Barr
“probably should have a similar kind of code.”

“I’m sure there’s a sense that anything he says is somehow the policy of the
foundation,” Mr. Gioia said. “I don’t think that’s true.”

Poetry magazine’s own origins, in 1912, and early importance owe much to its
association with High Modernism, including the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra
Pound. Joseph Parisi, who edited the magazine from 1983 to 2003, used to
send personal letters to poets whose work was promising but not up to the
magazine’s standards. One grateful recipient was Ruth Lilly, who, even
before the bequest, had endowed a $100,000 poetry prize and two fellowships.
Mr. Parisi’s successor, Christian Wiman, has tripled Poetry’s circulation,
to 30,000, and earned wide praise.

Among those who have benefited directly from the foundation’s largess is
Brian Culhane, the winner last month of the Emily Dickinson Award, a $10,000
prize given to a poet over 50 who has not published a book of poetry.
Jeffrey Shotts, poetry editor of Graywolf Press, which will publish Mr.
Culhane’s first book with Poetry Foundation support, said that Mr. Culhane
was selected from 1,600 applicants, up more than 400 from the previous year.

“Certainly, the award has totally altered my own perception of my career as
a poet, and I hope opened up a new galaxy of readers for me,” said Mr.
Culhane, a schoolteacher in Seattle. “Prior to that,” he said, “there was
maybe a solitary moon or two.”

CA,

I agree with your intent, I'm sure. But I'm confused about tactics and mode,
I'm confused as to how "cooking without thinking" contributes to (and
furthers) a genocide that happened 400+ years ago. If you seek
true reparations, push (push how? I've no idea) govts. to recognize the
atrocity and appropriate funds, make amends, etc.

I'm on board for Columbus Day, isn't the founding of any country a bit
idiotic? (Ceremonious garb, color guard, trumpets a'blaring, long-winded
speech by poor writer, etc...)

If you want to think about all the Iraqis killed and abused by the United States and it's armed forces, go see Brian De Palma's new movie "Redacted" on Thanksgiving Day.  I emerged numb from it but it was very good, if depressing.  Regards, Tom Savage

enslavement, this giant dark finger tamping out the lights of

FUCK THANKSGIVING DAY!

At least take a moment to think about the people of Iraq on
Thanksgiving Day, even if you are not fasting.

More and more we begin to realize how incredible their suffering is.
And they can't even escape it!  Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW!
interviewed a grade school teacher from Baghdad who took MONTHS and
MONTHS to be able to get permission to leave Iraq to visit the US!
For those who have not heard about this woman, the stories she has are
incredibly brutal and difficult to hear.  Her students had become pen
pals with students in the Bronx.  The students in the Bronx slowly
watched their pen pals disappear.

The United States should be making SPACE for all and any Iraqi
citizens who need a safe SPACE to go to, to be taken care of, brought
back to healthy people.  When we finally pull out of Iraq what about
the women for instance?  Is no one thinking about the women?  Women's
lives were very different in Iraq than they are in places like Saudi
Arabia and other countries.  It worries me that women who have enjoyed
their human rights in a secular state will be trampled and enslaved
soon.

We should be locating a very large parcel of land in the US right now
where we are building schools and rehab centers equipped with grief
counselors, doctors, libraries, for Iraqis who need to shelter and
comfort.

It's clear we have made Iraq nothing but unstable.  People are
suffering every single day.

This is what I want us to think about on Thanksgiving Day.

But maybe you don't pay your taxes, meaning that you are not
complicit.  In that case your conscience should be free and clean.
Have a nice Thanksgiving Day.

BY THE WAY THIS GOES FOR CANADIANS WHO HAVE SPENT TIME LIVING AND
WORKING IN THE UNITED STATES POST IRAQ INVASION.  You too have aided
the cause by paying American taxes.

I say this because I JUST yesterday had a conversation with a Canadian
who has been living and working in Philadelphia for the last three
years.  He kept blaming us, saying Americans are all to blame because
we all allow it to continue.  When I pointed out that he was paying
taxes and also funding the war he got a little annoyed.  And he makes
twice as much money as I do, maybe more, and I pointed out that he
pays more taxes than I do as a result.  "How many more bullets are you
sending over the ocean?"

In the end we are all guilty!  United in our guilt!

The web page once again for those who want to join the fast:
http://ThanksgivingDayFast.blogspot.com

We are all guilty!  United in our guilt!

I cannot CELEBRATE a day of THANKS while my country is at war.  I am
not as grateful as I am angry, disappointed, and wanting to make the
world safer,

I understand the symbolic gesture of a person who can eat daily for
one day joining the billions of the hungry and starving who do so year
round, a great many of them a direct cause of US policies, at home and
abroad.

But it doesn't help feed anyone who doesn't want to be hungry and is
forced to be so.

Every Thanksgiving--and every day of the year--there's a huge need for
volunteers, organizers, activists, contributors in any way--to fight
against the hunger in the USA often right down the street, and growing
daily, and the hunger being spread directly by American money in Iraq,
Lebanon, Palestine, Afghanistan and indirectly in many dozen countries
around the world.

(In Lebanon this year 25% of farm lands were unusable  because of the
millions of illegally supplied and used  US cluster bombs dropped
there during the Israeli invasion of 2006.  By the US's own laws,
cluster bombs are illegal to supply to anyone known to be  using them
on civilian populations.)

A great many of my mother's family were murdered in the Holocaust of
the Americas. The way to remember them is to do something for the
persons being starved, deprived of health care, livelihoods, decent
schools, homes, heating, electricity by the policies and billions of
dollars of the Government in the USA and abroad.  I think a form
eugenics of the poor is going on in this country, and that abroad not
only through wars but via billions in aid, the US government openly
funds near-starvation as a weapon.


Instead of just  being too mad to eat for a day, there's a lot one can
do to get involved in changing things in adults games so the children
--and parents--won't be going hungry, from one's neighborhood to whole
countries. Hunger is a weapon used against children, to destroy the
future of "unwanted"  persons and "enemies" in American cities and
towns and those under American attack.

The sanctions on Iraq and the continual bombings --President Clinton
dropped more bombs than any other American president--following the
Gulf War and leading to the Invasion and Occupation--killed over a
half million children.
Then there is the "Quiet Holocaust" of 7 million children a year due
to "structural adjustments" of economies in Latin America and Africa.
Starvation, disease, ethnic cleansing, proxy wars, sanctions--Somalia,
Darfur, Congo, Niger, Rwanda--and many more--

And this also creates more such "enemies" among the survivors. More
people who won't deserve to live in other countries, the killing of
whom takes away ever more funding in the US due to "security,"
creating further lack of health care, collapsing infra-structures,
lack of fuel assistance, foreclosures . . .
How many to die in the War on Poverty, War on Drugs, War on Terror?

Children are the future--one may weep and rage for the past, but the
present and future are in our own hands.

Here is an example, from a story originally in the Los Angeles Times,
24 September 2007, of one such situation of US foreign aid dollars at
work , what it means for the futures of children,  one that has grown
much worse in the almost two months since then.

    The War on Gaza\'s Children

    By Saree Makdisi
    PalestineChronicle.com
    An entire generation of Palestinians in Gaza is growing up
stunted: physically and nutritionally stunted because they are not
getting enough to eat; emotionally stunted because of the pressures of
living in a virtual prison and facing the constant threat of
destruction and displacement; intellectually and academically stunted
because they cannot concentrate -- or, even if they can, because they
are trying to study and learn in circumstances that no child should
have to endure.
    Even before Israel this week declared Gaza "hostile territory" --
apparently in preparation for cutting off the last remaining supplies
of fuel and electricity to 1.5 million men, women and children -- the
situation was dire.
    As a result of Israel\'s blockade on most imports and exports and
other policies designed to punish the populace, about 70% of Gaza\'s
workforce is now unemployed or without pay, according to the United
Nations, and about 80% of its residents live in grinding poverty.
About 1.2 million of them are now dependent for their day-to-day
survival on food handouts from U.N. or international agencies, without
which, as the World Food Program\'s Kirstie Campbell put it, "they are
liable to starve."
    An increasing number of Palestinian families in Gaza are unable to
offer their children more than one meager meal a day, often little
more than rice and boiled lentils. Fresh fruit and vegetables are
beyond the reach of many families. Meat and chicken are impossibly
expensive. Gaza faces the rich waters of the Mediterranean, but fish
is unavailable in its markets because the Israeli navy has curtailed
the movements of Gaza\'s fishermen.
    Los Angeles parents who have spent the last few weeks running from
one back-to-school sale to another could do worse than to spare a few
minutes to think about their counterparts in the Gaza Strip. As a
result of the siege, Gaza is not only short of raw textiles and other
key goods but also paper, ink and vital school supplies. One-third of
Gaza\'s children started the school year missing necessary textbooks.
John Ging, the Gaza director of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
whose schools take care of 200,000 children in Gaza, has warned that
children come to school "hungry and unable to concentrate."
    Israel says that its policies in Gaza are designed to put pressure
on the Palestinian population to in turn put pressure on those who
fire crude home-made rockets from Gaza into the Israeli town of
Sderot. Those rocket attacks are wrong. But it is also wrong to punish
an entire population for the actions of a few -- actions that the
schoolchildren of Gaza and their beleagueredparents are in any case
powerless to stop.
    It is a violation of international law to collectively punish more
than a million people for something they did not do. According to the
Geneva Convention, to which it is a signatory, Israel actually has the
obligation to ensure the well-being of the people on whom it has
chosen to impose a military occupation for more than four decades.
    Instead, it has shrugged off the law. It has ignored the repeated
demands of the U.N. Security Council. It has dismissed the
International Court of Justice in the Hague. What John Dugard, the
U.N.\'s special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied
territories, refers to as the "carefully managed" strangulation of
Gaza -- in full view of an uncaring world -- is explicitly part of its
strategy. "The idea," said Dov Weisglass, an Israeli government
advisor, "is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not make them die
of hunger."

There's not a day that goes by that I don't take a moment to think about the people of Iraq. At the same time, I don't really buy the argument that citizens of a republic, and even less foreign nationals, are complicit in the actions of their government simply by virtue of paying taxes to the state. in all seriousness, this war isn't being funded by tax dollars, it's being funded by a grotesque budget deficit. Which means the people paying for it are not the people paying taxes today, but the people who will be paying taxes thirty years from now. I'll probably be one of them, knock on wood, but many of them are not even alive today. Are they complicit? ARe those of us who voted against King George in our attempt to keep him out of power complicit?

I don't think so.

There are plenty of things that people are blameworthy for, but I don't agree that you can pin the iraq war on the entirety of the populace just by virtue of us living here. Generally speaking you're right: to quote the sex pistols or tool, whichever you prefer, no one is innocent. But just because we're not innocent doesn't mean we're guilty of every crime that's ever been committed by a bully. Bullying, which is what we're talking about here, whether it's done by a nation against another, or a bigger kid on the playground against a smaller kid, is about as unjust and immoral as actions go. But participation in an unjust action by itself doesn't confer guilt. It never has and it never will. Anything stating otherwise is just propaganda and politics, and frankly I've had enough of that sort of thing over the last decade or so.

It won't be until the discourse of the populace that has become so shrill and clangorous can once again be conducted rationally, calmly, and open mindedly that democracy can work. There are a lot of people to blame for that shrillness, and I'd suggest that endeavoring to be innocent of that charge is every bit as important to preventing injustice (particularly for american citizens) as is accepting the realities of the evils our government is doing and has done in the world.

Chris Cogburn - percussion - austin
Austin-based improvising percussionist Chris Cogburn is an active
composer, performer, educator and organizer within an expansive global
community of creative artists.  Approaching the physical nature of his
chosen instrument with an interest and attention to the drum's subtle
and overlooked timbres and textures, Cogburn's music gives rise to
unexpected sound worlds suffused with meanings and forms, acute yet
infinite.  Moving across, atop, below and around a single drum with a
variety of percussive objects and implements, Cogburn's fluid
physicality provides a rich dynamic to an expanding complexity of
sound.

Primarily working in the field of Creative Improvised Music, Cogburn
has collaborated with many of the premiere international artists in
contemporary music, including: John Butcher, Pauline Oliveros, Stuart
Dempster, Dave Dove, Joelle Leandre, Jaap Blonk, Sean Meehan, Joe
McPhee and avant-rock outsider Jandek.  Current projects include
Cogburn's inter-media group For Forms with poets Joshua Beckman and
Jen Bervin, dancer Scotty Heron and avant-turntablist Maria Chavez;
and frequent duo collaborations with Vancouver percussionist Jeffrey
Allport, avant-vocalist Liz Tonne and Seattle-based pianist Gust
Burns.

Since 1998, Cogburn has led workshops on creative music making around
the US, Canada and Mexico, working in contexts as diverse as inner
city community centers, homeless shelters, battered women's shelters,
art spaces, dance studios, public and private high schools and
elementary schools, Pauline Oliveros' Deep Listening Space and the
Universidad Aut=F3noma de Nuevo Le=F3n, Mexico.  He has recently received
performance and teaching grants through Meet The Composer, Creative
Connections and The Yellow Fox Foundation; held residencies through
Seattle Improvised Music, Nameless Sound and Gallery 1412; and has
performed at the No Idea Festival, the Seattle Improvised Music
Festival, Fuse Box Festival and the No West Festival.  In October 2006
Cogburn was fortunate enough to travel on the Wave Books Poetry Bus,
performing solo and with poet/Wave Books editor Joshua Beckman, with a
final performance at James Turrell's Roden Crater.

As an organizer, Cogburn has previously hosted performances by
international improvisors, always in direct collaboration with local
artists.  Beginning in the summer of 2003, Cogburn's Ten Pounds To The
Sound has hosted an annual festival of improvised music - the No Idea
Festival - showcasing a handful of Texas' premiere creative musicians
in collaboration with improvisors from around the U.S., Europe, Japan,
Mexico and Canada.  Regarded as "one of the finest creative improvised
music festivals in the world" (Paris Transatlantic) NIF aspires to
connect creative musicians, providing the space and time where
creative relationships can flourish, leading towards new areas and
approaches in the music.  For more information, see:

Memory of a Walk


I walked last Wednesday from the MCM building at Brown University to the
train station downtown. I took the 6:16 to New York. It arrived around
9:50 at Penn Station. On the way I remembered the walk. I followed myself
step by step, reconstructing as I went along. This was six days ago. Now
again I remember.

What did you think you were doing?

Memory and reconstruction worries me. I wanted to follow myself. I didn't
think of this at the time, that is the time of the walk itself, but only
later. I conductor asked if I were a philosopher; I think I appeared deep
in thought. I wanted to remember as much as possible. Later, several times
in the past six days, I thought I would try and remember again, try to
write everything down. But I thought this would take too much effort; it
wasn't until now, Tuesday, that I've had the energy to proceed.

What did you take with you?

I'm clearing my belongings out of Leslie Thornton's office. This trip I
took, in addition to what I brought up, a Cambodian bowed instrument, a
pair of slippers, some extra toiletries, a white towel. The towel and a
plastic bag were wrapped around the instrument and inserted into a cloth
bag. It was damp out. I added a polka-dotted umbrella as well, in case I
needed it.

Where did you go?

I went down the stairs and out the front door. Susan and Ellen were in the
office talking. I didn't say anything to them. I walked out the door and
turned right.

What did you do then?

I walked to the corner. I thought about going straight down as usual, but
instead crossed the street. I began walking up a slight hill to the Brown
Quadrangle. I passed two people as I turned into the Quadrangle. I took a
diagonal left, which would leave me out between two libraries.

Wait, I remember crossing the first intersection. I think there was little
or no traffic.

Then?

Then I walked diagonally through the cold mist, almost but not quite a
rain. I went through the gates to the top of the street. I didn't notice
the sculpture on the left; usually I look at it. I crossed the street. I
was surprised there was no traffic. I thought that usually there was
traffic. I began the descent of the hill. I passed the location of the old
Brown Music Department, where I had played several times; I thought about
that. I didn't think about the arts building that replaced it. I went
straight down the hill. I arrived at Benefit Street.

At Benefit Street you had several choices. What did you decide here?

I crossed Benefit street; I believe there was some traffic, but I'm not
sure. I continued going down the hill. I passed a corner building and
looked in a window. I wondered whether the window was where my studio at
Rhode Island School of Design used to be. I thought again about the
accusation I had stolen equipment and wondered how S. could possibly think
that since I had no place to take it but the school itself. I looked in
other windows on the way down; they were studios. I think they might have
been drawing studios; I'm not sure. I reached the bottom of the hill.

Now you're into the city itself, or at least the outskirts of the city, by
Providence River. What did you do?

I crossed the intersection here. This one I remember being easy. I arrived
at the bank of the river, the bank nearest the hill. I thought that the
time before I had crossed and taken the other bank. I found that the river
split, and that I was thrown off-course, that I ended up guiding myself by
the Statehouse dome. This time I felt tired, and stayed on the nearer
bank. I looked into the water as I walked towards the train station; I
couldn't see anything. I reached the next corner.

Then there was traffic?

There was a lot of traffic. I ran across the street; I was almost hit. I
continued on the other side.

Did you press the button for the traffic signal?

I remember a button, but it might have been farther on. I didn't press it,
I think. Perhaps I did.

And then?

Then I continued walking. I think it was either this block or the next,
possibly the end of this block, still by the river, that I heard foot-
steps. Or possibly saw someone ahead of me. But I think it began with the
footsteps. At the next intersection.

We're then at another heavily trafficked one?

Yes, the footsteps belonged to a woman, I think possibly a student, carry-
ing a backpack or small suitcase of some sort. I didn't see her full-on; I
couldn't identify her, but thought she might be blond.

What happened?

She had crossed the street and I crossed as well, somewhat behind her.
This was the second time I was almost hit; I wanted to make the light,
since the signals were long.

And then?

The road curved up ahead. Wait, there was a four-way stop intersection.
She continued up the curve on the left. I walked part of the way across
the bridge, crossing the Providence River. I stopped and looked down in
the water. I was looking for the herring or shad family fish I had seen
there before, in large schools. It was dark out; I looked for ripples in
the water. The week before I was guided by ripples. This time there were
none. I couldn't remember the name of the fish, something like mulhagen; I
still can't remember. I was frustrated, worried that I couldn't remember.

After looking in the water for a while?

I crossed the street. There was hardly any traffic. I looked up ahead to
see if the student was heading to the train station. I thought I saw her;
I couldn't be sure. I stopped on the other side of the street, which was
the other side of the bridge. I looked again down at the black water; I
was looking for the fish on the other side. Most of the time I had seen
them on this, the other side. This time again there was nothing, no
ripples, at least none visible. But wait.

Wait?

On the first, left-hand side of the bridge, I saw a leaf in the water; it
was large, and looked like one of the fish on its side; I wondered if it
was in fact one that was dying. When I looked on the other, right-hand
side of the bridge, I saw several more, and it was clear that they were
leaves, slowly going down the river.

Which way were they going?

I'm not sure; the river flowed slowly, but I believe from the right-hand
side to the left-hand side and beyond.

And then?

Then I began walking up the hill towards the train station. I had again to
go out into the street because the sidewalk was partly closed due to
construction. I walked past a number of parked cars on the right, in this
fashion. I noticed the construction was coming along, and remembered
hearing that apartments were to be built here. As I walked up the hill I
walked over a recently-asphalted entrance to the construction site, or
near the entrance. I wondered why the asphalt had been poured; it could
only be temporary and didn't seem to serve any purpose. I continued up the
sidewalk.

Did you see any birds?

No, often in the daytime, particularly in the spring, I had seen birds
around the site and in the trees directly to the left of the train
station. But this time there was nothing. I looked down into the huge
excavation beyond the immediate construction and noticed for the second
time, the train platform, I think it was the platform for the number 1 and
2 tracks, jutting out into it. The platform looked oddly spacious and
beautiful in the dark. I continued walking past the trees.

This was near the taxicab stand?

This went directly past the taxi stand. I saw a number of drivers standing
around; they were speaking a language I didn't understand. At first I
thought, this might be Pakistani, but then I thought Italian; I couldn't
hear well enough. The drivers all seemed to know one another. I wondered
what would happen if a new driver came along, who didn't speak the
language - would he or she be accepted in the group? Would the group, on
occasion, speak English to him or her? Would the driver be ignored? This
went on only for an instant. I reached the station doors and went in.

Just went in?

I remember looking at my cellphone on the way, at least twice, checking on
the time. I was early as usual; I think I arrived at 5:34, for the 6:16,
but I'm not sure. I was hungry.

How long did the walk take?

I think it took about twenty-one minutes, but I couldn't be sure. If I had
gone directly, it would have taken between seventeen and eighteen.

You were hungry? Were you hungry the whole time?

I was hungry the whole time; I had only breakfast at Louie's, a #1 with
orange juice extra, I think, beforehand. I was going to drink some Red
Bull to keep me going through the day, but had a large coffee with skim
milk instead; the Red Bull is still in the office.

So what did you do?

I went to the small cafe inside the train station. The man who served me
wasn't there; the woman was. I had often wondered about their relation-
ship; they seemed tight. I ordered, I think, something with apricot; I'm
not sure. I do remember eating it without getting sticky; I didn't have to
wash my hands afterwards.

And this whole time you were carrying both your camera bag with various
things you had brought with you, as well as the cloth bag contraption with
the Cambodian instrument and other things?

Yes. I believe I also took back a copy of The Structure of Reality with me
on this trip. I had a copy of Claire's demo DVD, since I'm writing a
recommendation for her. I remember I didn't change clothes; the clean ones
were still in the bag. I had some trail mix left over from the ride up. I
didn't want to order anything on the train.

And you were reading?

Yes, I had books with me, but I'm not sure I remember them. I definitely
had Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, which I had read; now I wanted to
finish Sanditon which was in the same Penguin volume, which of course I
did. And I had a copy of David Hume's Enquiry with me as well; I had been
reading about miracles. But I think there might have been a third book.
The week before I had carried a relatively medieval history of the tantric
schools of Tibet, but I don't think I had it with me this time.

What else were you carrying?

Other than the usual identifications, I had a small Olympus solid-state
recorder for notes. I didn't use it - I had been hoping to. The camera bag
was somewhat heavy of course. Another item - a small power supply for the
phone.

Do you remember going down the stairs from the office?

Not very well. I do remember having to negotiate the stairs because of the
awkwardness of the instrument package. Once outside, things were easy. I
had been afraid of rain; the skies were threatening all day. But as I
said, there was none, or rather just a light misting, slightly, nothing
more.

Money?

I had taken sixty dollars with me, but had spent very little. I spent
nothing on the train on the way up, so I had all of that. I spent little
there, and little on the train. I had walked down to Wickenden or
Wickendon street to go to an antique shop; I was hoping to find some
useful books, but nothing seemed promising. So I had most of the money
with me of course. I also had four rolls of unused Tri-X and Plus-X (the
new Plus-X) 16mm movie film to shoot in the winter and spring. And on the
way up I had brought a mini-DV tape for transferring the second roll I had
shot, but the roll wasn't back and the tape stayed in the office.

Anything else?

Some recommendation forms from Claire; I had to fill these out. I was
afraid they would get bent. I put them between the pages of something else
I was carrying back - I don't remember, a pamphlet of some sort.

Were you tired when you walked down to the train station?

I was extremely tired; I had hardly slept the night before - I coughed a
lot, there were sounds around, etc. I should add I sleep in the office to
save money; there's a futon. So I was glad that the air was bracing. I
went down to the train platform itself - #1 as usual - at 6:04 - I
remember looking at the clock - because it was open to the air and would
wake me up. I walked down; I haven't taken the elevator for a long time. I
noticed that the construction inside the station was down for the first
time - there were new escalators installed, but the one for track #1 only
went up.

Anything else?

Only that I remembered, as I approached the station, that I would be too
tired, and it would be too late, to go to the Border's bookshop in the
nearby mall. When I went into the station, I wouldn't come out again, at
least until the train I boarded left, which it did, two minutes late.

Steve-thanks for reminding me of the Macy's Day Parade--I haven't lived in NYC for a while (too long--
they DID go bankrupt, didn't they?--and right now I live across from a pueblo in New Mexico and living
among Native Americans well...this is an issue...David Chirot's comments below are very true
esp. in re: need to be conscious on a daily basis. But a holiday is "symbolic" and I find it unbearable
that so many turkeys are being slaughter so Americans can feed their faces--
what I'm saying is: although there IS so much each individual can do to try and bring some justice to
this horrifying planet of ours, I do believe it is important for us to stop mindlessly "celebrating"
things without thought. What should we be thankful for this year, America? Well, I plan to fast...

I have been reading A Levant Journal by George Seferis--the latest publicat=
ion from the wonderful Ibis Editions in Jerusalem. Much of the book's conte=
nt comes from Seferis's experiences as a diplomat for the Greek government-=
in-exile during the occupation. This got me thinking about how many moderni=
st poets worked in the foreign service at one level or another--St. John Pe=
rse, Octavio Paz, and Basil Bunting immediately come to mind. My question, =
for the scholars out there: does there exist any significant study of moder=
nist poetry and the foreign service?

It would be interesting to know what the name of the Cambodian instrument was.  I saw classical Cambodian dance once.  It was very beautiful but I don't remember the names of any of the instruments used.  Also, as far as I know, there is no language spoken in Pakistan or anywhere else called "Pakistani."  Like,in India, several languages are spoken in Pakistan.  But, it having been thirty seven years since I spent a short time in that country, I don't remember what they are.  Urdu, perhaps?  I like the intention behind this piece, though.  My epxerience has been, though, that I have to write this stuff while it is happening for it to really work.  Who is the you who is asking the questions, suddenly?  Anyway, thank you for an interesting piece.  Regards, Tom Savage

Alan Sondheim <sondheim@PANIX.COM> wrote:  Memory of a Walk


I walked last Wednesday from the MCM building at Brown University to the
train station downtown. I took the 6:16 to New York. It arrived around
9:50 at Penn Station. On the way I remembered the walk. I followed myself
step by step, reconstructing as I went along. This was six days ago. Now
again I remember.

What did you think you were doing?

Memory and reconstruction worries me. I wanted to follow myself. I didn't
think of this at the time, that is the time of the walk itself, but only
later. I conductor asked if I were a philosopher; I think I appeared deep
in thought. I wanted to remember as much as possible. Later, several times
in the past six days, I thought I would try and remember again, try to
write everything down. But I thought this would take too much effort; it
wasn't until now, Tuesday, that I've had the energy to proceed.

What did you take with you?

I'm clearing my belongings out of Leslie Thornton's office. This trip I
took, in addition to what I brought up, a Cambodian bowed instrument, a
pair of slippers, some extra toiletries, a white towel. The towel and a
plastic bag were wrapped around the instrument and inserted into a cloth
bag. It was damp out. I added a polka-dotted umbrella as well, in case I
needed it.

Where did you go?

I went down the stairs and out the front door. Susan and Ellen were in the
office talking. I didn't say anything to them. I walked out the door and
turned right.

What did you do then?

I walked to the corner. I thought about going straight down as usual, but
instead crossed the street. I began walking up a slight hill to the Brown
Quadrangle. I passed two people as I turned into the Quadrangle. I took a
diagonal left, which would leave me out between two libraries.

Wait, I remember crossing the first intersection. I think there was little
or no traffic.

Then?

Then I walked diagonally through the cold mist, almost but not quite a
rain. I went through the gates to the top of the street. I didn't notice
the sculpture on the left; usually I look at it. I crossed the street. I
was surprised there was no traffic. I thought that usually there was
traffic. I began the descent of the hill. I passed the location of the old
Brown Music Department, where I had played several times; I thought about
that. I didn't think about the arts building that replaced it. I went
straight down the hill. I arrived at Benefit Street.

At Benefit Street you had several choices. What did you decide here?

I crossed Benefit street; I believe there was some traffic, but I'm not
sure. I continued going down the hill. I passed a corner building and
looked in a window. I wondered whether the window was where my studio at
Rhode Island School of Design used to be. I thought again about the
accusation I had stolen equipment and wondered how S. could possibly think
that since I had no place to take it but the school itself. I looked in
other windows on the way down; they were studios. I think they might have
been drawing studios; I'm not sure. I reached the bottom of the hill.

Now you're into the city itself, or at least the outskirts of the city, by
Providence River. What did you do?

I crossed the intersection here. This one I remember being easy. I arrived
at the bank of the river, the bank nearest the hill. I thought that the
time before I had crossed and taken the other bank. I found that the river
split, and that I was thrown off-course, that I ended up guiding myself by
the Statehouse dome. This time I felt tired, and stayed on the nearer
bank. I looked into the water as I walked towards the train station; I
couldn't see anything. I reached the next corner.

Then there was traffic?

There was a lot of traffic. I ran across the street; I was almost hit. I
continued on the other side.

Did you press the button for the traffic signal?

I remember a button, but it might have been farther on. I didn't press it,
I think. Perhaps I did.

And then?

Then I continued walking. I think it was either this block or the next,
possibly the end of this block, still by the river, that I heard foot-
steps. Or possibly saw someone ahead of me. But I think it began with the
footsteps. At the next intersection.

We're then at another heavily trafficked one?

Yes, the footsteps belonged to a woman, I think possibly a student, carry-
ing a backpack or small suitcase of some sort. I didn't see her full-on; I
couldn't identify her, but thought she might be blond.

What happened?

She had crossed the street and I crossed as well, somewhat behind her.
This was the second time I was almost hit; I wanted to make the light,
since the signals were long.

And then?

The road curved up ahead. Wait, there was a four-way stop intersection.
She continued up the curve on the left. I walked part of the way across
the bridge, crossing the Providence River. I stopped and looked down in
the water. I was looking for the herring or shad family fish I had seen
there before, in large schools. It was dark out; I looked for ripples in
the water. The week before I was guided by ripples. This time there were
none. I couldn't remember the name of the fish, something like mulhagen; I
still can't remember. I was frustrated, worried that I couldn't remember.

After looking in the water for a while?

I crossed the street. There was hardly any traffic. I looked up ahead to
see if the student was heading to the train station. I thought I saw her;
I couldn't be sure. I stopped on the other side of the street, which was
the other side of the bridge. I looked again down at the black water; I
was looking for the fish on the other side. Most of the time I had seen
them on this, the other side. This time again there was nothing, no
ripples, at least none visible. But wait.

Wait?

On the first, left-hand side of the bridge, I saw a leaf in the water; it
was large, and looked like one of the fish on its side; I wondered if it
was in fact one that was dying. When I looked on the other, right-hand
side of the bridge, I saw several more, and it was clear that they were
leaves, slowly going down the river.

Which way were they going?

I'm not sure; the river flowed slowly, but I believe from the right-hand
side to the left-hand side and beyond.

And then?

Then I began walking up the hill towards the train station. I had again to
go out into the street because the sidewalk was partly closed due to
construction. I walked past a number of parked cars on the right, in this
fashion. I noticed the construction was coming along, and remembered
hearing that apartments were to be built here. As I walked up the hill I
walked over a recently-asphalted entrance to the construction site, or
near the entrance. I wondered why the asphalt had been poured; it could
only be temporary and didn't seem to serve any purpose. I continued up the
sidewalk.

Did you see any birds?

No, often in the daytime, particularly in the spring, I had seen birds
around the site and in the trees directly to the left of the train
station. But this time there was nothing. I looked down into the huge
excavation beyond the immediate construction and noticed for the second
time, the train platform, I think it was the platform for the number 1 and
2 tracks, jutting out into it. The platform looked oddly spacious and
beautiful in the dark. I continued walking past the trees.

This was near the taxicab stand?

This went directly past the taxi stand. I saw a number of drivers standing
around; they were speaking a language I didn't understand. At first I
thought, this might be Pakistani, but then I thought Italian; I couldn't
hear well enough. The drivers all seemed to know one another. I wondered
what would happen if a new driver came along, who didn't speak the
language - would he or she be accepted in the group? Would the group, on
occasion, speak English to him or her? Would the driver be ignored? This
went on only for an instant. I reached the station doors and went in.

Just went in?

I remember looking at my cellphone on the way, at least twice, checking on
the time. I was early as usual; I think I arrived at 5:34, for the 6:16,
but I'm not sure. I was hungry.

How long did the walk take?

I think it took about twenty-one minutes, but I couldn't be sure. If I had
gone directly, it would have taken between seventeen and eighteen.

You were hungry? Were you hungry the whole time?

I was hungry the whole time; I had only breakfast at Louie's, a #1 with
orange juice extra, I think, beforehand. I was going to drink some Red
Bull to keep me going through the day, but had a large coffee with skim
milk instead; the Red Bull is still in the office.

So what did you do?

I went to the small cafe inside the train station. The man who served me
wasn't there; the woman was. I had often wondered about their relation-
ship; they seemed tight. I ordered, I think, something with apricot; I'm
not sure. I do remember eating it without getting sticky; I didn't have to
wash my hands afterwards.

And this whole time you were carrying both your camera bag with various
things you had brought with you, as well as the cloth bag contraption with
the Cambodian instrument and other things?

Yes. I believe I also took back a copy of The Structure of Reality with me
on this trip. I had a copy of Claire's demo DVD, since I'm writing a
recommendation for her. I remember I didn't change clothes; the clean ones
were still in the bag. I had some trail mix left over from the ride up. I
didn't want to order anything on the train.

And you were reading?

Yes, I had books with me, but I'm not sure I remember them. I definitely
had Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, which I had read; now I wanted to
finish Sanditon which was in the same Penguin volume, which of course I
did. And I had a copy of David Hume's Enquiry with me as well; I had been
reading about miracles. But I think there might have been a third book.
The week before I had carried a relatively medieval history of the tantric
schools of Tibet, but I don't think I had it with me this time.

What else were you carrying?

Other than the usual identifications, I had a small Olympus solid-state
recorder for notes. I didn't use it - I had been hoping to. The camera bag
was somewhat heavy of course. Another item - a small power supply for the
phone.

Do you remember going down the stairs from the office?

Not very well. I do remember having to negotiate the stairs because of the
awkwardness of the instrument package. Once outside, things were easy. I
had been afraid of rain; the skies were threatening all day. But as I
said, there was none, or rather just a light misting, slightly, nothing
more.

Money?

I had taken sixty dollars with me, but had spent very little. I spent
nothing on the train on the way up, so I had all of that. I spent little
there, and little on the train. I had walked down to Wickenden or
Wickendon street to go to an antique shop; I was hoping to find some
useful books, but nothing seemed promising. So I had most of the money
with me of course. I also had four rolls of unused Tri-X and Plus-X (the
new Plus-X) 16mm movie film to shoot in the winter and spring. And on the
way up I had brought a mini-DV tape for transferring the second roll I had
shot, but the roll wasn't back and the tape stayed in the office.

Anything else?

Some recommendation forms from Claire; I had to fill these out. I was
afraid they would get bent. I put them between the pages of something else
I was carrying back - I don't remember, a pamphlet of some sort.

Were you tired when you walked down to the train station?

I was extremely tired; I had hardly slept the night before - I coughed a
lot, there were sounds around, etc. I should add I sleep in the office to
save money; there's a futon. So I was glad that the air was bracing. I
went down to the train platform itself - #1 as usual - at 6:04 - I
remember looking at the clock - because it was open to the air and would
wake me up. I walked down; I haven't taken the elevator for a long time. I
noticed that the construction inside the station was down for the first
time - there were new escalators installed, but the one for track #1 only
went up.

Anything else?

Only that I remembered, as I approached the station, that I would be too
tired, and it would be too late, to go to the Border's bookshop in the
nearby mall. When I went into the station, I wouldn't come out again, at
least until the train I boarded left, which it did, two minutes late.

I'm literally running out the door to my stupid job, wish I had more
time to write more.

But David, did you not read my petition?  Helping others in need is
exactly what I ask for.

Is it possible you actually DID read the petition and missed that
part?  How is it possible?  It's pretty clear that helping others is a
very big component to the fast.  Here's read it again:
http://www.petitiononline.com/FastIr/petition.html

In Latin America, and to a lesser extent in Europe (and
once-upon-a-time in the US--remember Hawthorne in London?), foreign
service jobs (at sub-ambassadorial levels) have been a traditional
form of government support for writers. Very few of them have had
training in related fields, and sually there is little work involved.
The impact on the writers seems to be what one would expect from a
subsidized stay in a foreign country, rather than an immersion in
bureaucracy. Neruda wrote his Residencia en la tierra and Canto
general while posted to various countries. Not many traces of the
jobs that paid his way.

Off the top of my head, I can think of several Cuban poets who
post-revolution have served overseas: Fayad Jamis, Eliseo Diego,
Heberto Padilla, Miguel Barnet. Barnet's jobs have been serious, the
others less so. Romain Gary served the French government similarly.

Sometimes diplomatic appointments have been used by friends in
government to protect writers from the fires at home. Certainly true
of Jamis and Diego.

Yes, Urdu, a language of arabic descent, is the most widely spoken language
in Pakistan although, as you rightly said, many other languages exist. Urdu
is also spoken in large parts of India. Faiz Ahmed Faiz, is a celebrated
Urdu poet in Pakistan.

BTW, Alan's piece is splendid, I thought.

It would be interesting to know what the name of the Cambodian instrument
was.  I saw classical Cambodian dance once.  It was very beautiful but I
don't remember the names of any of the instruments used.  Also, as far as I
know, there is no language spoken in Pakistan or anywhere else called
"Pakistani."  Like,in India, several languages are spoken in Pakistan.  But,
it having been thirty seven years since I spent a short time in that
country, I don't remember what they are.  Urdu, perhaps?  I like the
intention behind this piece, though.  My epxerience has been, though, that I
have to write this stuff while it is happening for it to really work.  Who
is the you who is asking the questions, suddenly?  Anyway, thank you for an
interesting piece.  Regards, Tom Savage

Interesting. But in the cases I mentioned, the poets were working in the di=
plomatic corps as their profession--Bunting for a much shorter part of his =
life, I believe, than the others. Seferis seems to have experienced it, at =
least in the period covered by this book, as a great conflict: "I exercise =
the profession of human being and the profession of public servant. Things =
dramatically irreconcilable at times, and sometimes a great weight--and the=

--you see that the one profession cancels out the other.""=0A=0A=0A----- Or=

Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1919, Udo Kasemets studied at the Tallinn
Conservatory and the Stuttgart Academy of Music in Germany before moving to
North America in 1951. Here, Kasemets discovered the work of John Cage and
soon abandoned his traditional training to explore electroactoustics.  Over
the past four decades, Kasemets has written compositions based on works by =
a
wide range of contemporary poets. His new pOemPERA is based on Susan Howe=B9s
=B3The Liberties.=B2=20

Both performances of =B3The Liberties=B2 of Susan Howe, A pOemPERA by Udo
Kasemets (Dec. 1 and 2) will feature Howe reading sections of =B3The
Liberties=B2 and Kasemets performing the work, written for piano, with two
vocalists, Susan Layard and Linda Catlin Smith. Visuals will be provided by
video artist Pierre Tremblay.

In addition to the two scheduled performances, Howe will read from =B3The
Liberties=B2 and forthcoming work and participate in a public discussion with
Kasemets at 4:30 on Friday, Nov. 30 (the reading/discussion will also take
place in the Eaton Lecture Hall at 80 Gould St. Toronto).

All events are free.

Dear Jason,
What you bring up here is very important: the question of individual vs. collective guilt.
I believe it remains an open question, one much debated over.
Just as it upsets me to be called an "Anglo" in New Mexico when I am in no way an Anglo I still appear to be one
to others and so, without my wanting to be, I am an Anglo for as long as I live here. Very strange...I did argue so long that my ancestry is such that most peope in the world would call me anything but "Anglo" but somehow I am very self-conscious about that thing I don't relate to being called ("Anglo")
Yesterday a woman from India (someone I know from the internet/ the way we half know people/ don't really know people from the internet) wrote me that everyone hates America. I felt such despair over this, knowing that in spite of our numerous e-mails, she had to see me as one of the ones "everyone hates"????
The discourse in this country IS shrill as you say, Jason,?and I also find this very frustrating.
I, too, believe democracy can work. I, too, believe that we who live in America are very fortunate to be here, that much can be overcome because of the system we live under. I wrote these words (words much like yours) to the woman from India. I don't know if she understood or believed anything I said. But I believe it. I want the polarization in this country to somehow....somehow what? I don't know. Everything feels so polarized...
I am grateful to have been born in the U.S. My grandparents kissed the ground in this country when they arrived because they were escaping religious persecution and certain death.
How sad I was to answer this e-mail to this Indian woman, trying to explain and/ or describe "why" I believe America can rectify its wrongs. But I do believe it, even if?those from foreign nations hate me for saying it.
The question of individual vs. collective guilt remains a question.
And we all have our separate conclusions and fears.
I always fast on thanksgiving regardless. But that's because I feel it is more a sign of gratitude to fast than feast. Even the poorest among us (hopefully the homeless, certainly the homeless in San Francisco--for they have the system down in San Francisco, at least: to help the homeless) has more than enough to eat (I do not deny the poverty or the fact that so many live on almost nothing in this country). We do not wake feeling the fear of?being killed?that very day. We do not live in a regime where we are being pulled off the streets for not dressing correctly (I refer to Iranian women (specifically right now) who, by the way, feel betrayed by American feminists who they have tried to gain support from but haven't gained any support from--I mean, very little has been said publicly by American feminists re: abuses women face in the Muslim world)--we (I have to speak for women now because I feel the way women are treated in the Muslim world is key to all that is happening t
oday) are not stoned to death.
Just not to make this message too hopeless, I'd like to?write?this name:?"Martin Luther King"--he had a dream--it must have killed him inside to?shout those words ("I have a dream") in the midst of such horrifying humiliation done to his fellow man. But yes, "I have a dream" said Martin Luther King--and he DID change the world with his dream/ he did change America and he was the poet of poets as far as I'm concerned because his words matched his deeds. And I do believe that America is populated by many such as Martin Luther King. Many of us have a dream to fulfill the basic premises of this great country of ours (and I still say "this great country of ours" and I'm tired of that being interpreted in a way which might mean I in any way support any type of violent policies--I am totally against war--I worked in war/ I know what war "is": for me it is: burn victims, quadriplegics, amputtees, head injuries, and psychological trauma which never leaves. I won't even talk about the
deaths because when you see such suffering death is the easy way out (but never for the families of the dead--never)
But whether we like it or not, wherever we go, when we open our mouths, or even when our clothes are noticed, or even our body language is recognized all anyone sees is "America" and so if the idea of collective guilt is denied, which it has been denied by many, collective identity is there whether we like it or not. So our actions matter, not only personally, but in a broader sense.
And I wish you all a good day, for me the worst day of the year--this holiday just gets to me but...since I am an American and must take collective responsibility for our holidays as well:
I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving,
Bobbi

There's not a day that goes by that I don't take a moment to think about the
people of Iraq. At the same time, I don't really buy the argument that citizens
of a republic, and even less foreign nationals, are complicit in the actions of
their government simply by virtue of paying taxes to the state. in all
seriousness, this war isn't being funded by tax dollars, it's being funded by a
grotesque budget deficit. Which means the people paying for it are not the
people paying taxes today, but the people who will be paying taxes thirty years
from now. I'll probably be one of them, knock on wood, but many of them are not
even alive today. Are they complicit? ARe those of us who voted against King
George in our attempt to keep him out of power complicit?

I don't think so.

There are plenty of things that people are blameworthy for, but I don't agree
that you can pin the iraq war on the entirety of the populace just by virtue of
us living here. Generally speaking you're right: to quote the sex pistols or
tool, whichever you prefer, no one is innocent. But just because we're not
innocent doesn't mean we're guilty of every crime that's ever been committed by
a bully. Bullying, which is what we're talking about here, whether it's done by
a nation against another, or a bigger kid on the playground against a smaller
kid, is about as unjust and immoral as actions go. But participation in an
unjust action by itself doesn't confer guilt. It never has and it never will.
Anything stating otherwise is just propaganda and politics, and frankly I've had
enough of that sort of thing over the last decade or so.

It won't be until the discourse of the populace that has become so shrill and
clangorous can once again be conducted rationally, calmly, and open mindedly
that democracy can work. There are a lot of people to blame for that shrillness,
and I'd suggest that endeavoring to be innocent of that charge is every bit as
important to preventing injustice (particularly for american citizens) as is
accepting the realities of the evils our government is doing and has done in the
world.

A complex story. Of how a Marxist government can turn neo-liberal and
pro-industrialist
to an almost maddening degree and end up mishandling the state-run police
forces
leading to a genocide. A genocide against poor peasants unwilling to give up
their
farmlands earmarked by the state for industrial development.

West Bengal is the only state in India that has been dominated by a Marxist
government
CPIM (Communist Party of India, Marxist) for 30 years. This government  has
been
elected and re-elected by the people several times in a multi-party
democracy. They
came into power in 1977 following the tyrannical regime of the previous
Congress
government. It was a massive electoral win for them which they immediately
followed
up with land reforms that supported millions of poor landless Bengali
farmers. The
agrarian system strengthened, people poured their trust on the Marxist
government.
They found ready support amongst virtually every strata of the society. At
the same
time no energy was lost to mobilize the unemployed frustrated youth into a
cadre-based
political force.

While agriculture propspered, a rapid decline occured in the industrial
scenario. Most profiteering
businesses moved out of the state or collapsed. Trade did prosper centering
Kolkata
but the engineering industry nearly vanished forcing out of the state
thousands of skilled workers
engineers and technocrats, myself included.

Strangely, the same government has now turned their tides against agrarian
Bengal. Kind
of falling out of place in a rapidly growing Indian economy, they are
desperate to invite
national and foreign investors. A village called Nandigram was earmarked to
be transformed
into the next industrial hub. Although the government had designed a
rehabilitation program
for the to-be-displaced farmers, they weren't willing to evacuate. A
genocide resulted
from the local farmers defiance against the state-run police early this
year.

For all these months the village had been nearly sealed by the state
government cadres
(marxist representatives of the lowest rank) who, often impersonating as the
police (
dressed up in their uniforms) had committed serious crimes including rape,
murder, massacre and
evacuation of hundreds of villagers. The real police force, largely
undercover, were instructed to
stay out of "all this".The press being kept out of the corner, the real
facts are still unknown.
A second genocide took place on 14th November, 2007.

The Chief Minister of the state of West Bengal, Buddhadev Bhattacharya, a
much respected politician,
hailed often for his honesty, a fervent supporter of poetry and arts,
responsible for funding several films of
Satyajit Ray and also an accomplished playwright is viewed as the main
culprit. He is being criticized and
vilified all over the state. He has become a larger than life example of how
"power corrupts" in India.
Today he is a Stalinist to many.

Poetry has a very high public profile in Bengal and when poets and writers
lead a mass rally, it scares
the police, concerns the government. Leading mainstream poets like Sankha
Ghosh, Joy Goswami, writers,
painters, film-directors like Aparna Sen, playwrights led protest rallies on
the 14th of November and
cordoned the police head-quarters in Kolkata. They were joined by more than
a hundred poet/writers
who represent parallel Bengali literature and  thousands of common
Kolkatans. The police baton-charged
the protestors. Many were hurt. Several major Bengali poets like Sankha
Ghosh, Alok Sarkar had earlier
renounced all state honors they had received.

Protest rallies have flooded the City of Joy for the past one week, often
creating hour-long traffic jams
causing all sorts of public inconvenience. Poetry-readings and street-plays
are happening in many street
corners of the city every single day.

Of the hundreds of newslinks that could be found on the net here are a
select few.

Here is a link to Sanhati, an organization fighting neo-liberalism in Bengal
http://sanhati.com/literature/
contains photos of protest rallies

Here are some links to privately shot videos at Nandigram on Nov 14, 2007
that are disturbingly revealing
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6507874900373821154
The video depicts police brutalities against the peasants.

Faces in search of justice
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5258104696292531156

Joy Goswami, a popular Bengali poet reads on the streets
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7191393332856943004

Kabir Suman writer, folk-singer, sings on one of the city's busiest avenues

Joining several other Bengali language webzines, Kaurab also wears
a black badge of protest today.

A woman from Iran spoke to me recently about the abuses she and other
Muslim women face, and also felt betrayed that the American media
mentions the abuse women face in Sunni Saudi Arabia even less than
the abuse women face in Iran. She fears for her safety and freedom in
her homeland, but told me that America's talk of "World War 3" with
Iran is just making matters worse back home. She suggested that
American's selectively singling out Iran (while generally letting
Saudi Arabia slide) made it clear, to her, that women's rights has
very little to do with the assault on her country as a roque state,
etc., by the Bush regime. It's a complex issue, but of course her
voice isn't going to be heard too much in the U.S.A. American media
either. She's not saying that American women shouldn't support, or
find ways to be in solidarity, with Iranian women in this struggle.
But why single out Iran and not, say, Saudi Arabia where the abuse is
just as bad?

nice bobbi individually speaking it's all collective guilt on individual
levels if that makes any sense
spoke about alot of this at the very boring dinner i attended with 2
vegetarians in attendance
i picked the wrong dinner that's for sure
if all the kids fighting in iraq (which sickens me more each day)
collectively, if not guiltily oput down their weapons
and refused to fight an unjust war in the name of democracy there we'd
have fini  ah  but this is just a peace-pipe dream

> According to the United Nations, reported cases of rape in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have risen 60 percent since August. The epidemic of rape and sexual violence is a humanitarian catastrophe in this war-torn country where more than 4 million people have died during years of conflict. We must take action now.
> The good news is that on October 31, Senators Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (S.2279), legislation that will significantly increase U.S. commitment to ending gender-based violence in the DRC and around the world.
> We at CARE, a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty, have been working with local staff to eliminate the violence in the DRC for several years. Please help by contacting Congress today and telling them to pass the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA) immediately.
> The urgency of the crisis cannot be overstated: "In the case of eastern DRC, the rates of these violations have risen to catastrophic levels and their increasing regularity and brutality over time is well documented," Kevin Fitzcharles, CARE's country director in Uganda, said in recent testimony to Congress. "Armed groups in eastern Congo are effectively using sexual violence as a weapon of war and destruction, inflicting grievous physical, psychological and social harm on women, children and entire communities."
> The physical and emotional harm that these women and girls face is staggering. While the perpetrators of these horrific crimes simply move on to their next victims, violated women and girls rarely find the medical and psychological care they so desperately need. CARE staff has been on the ground in the DRC working to address the causes and consequences of violence against women and girls; however, much remains to be done to address this scourge.
> Passing the IVAWA would be a major step toward ending the violence endured by Congolese women - and all violence against women. Please don't wait a minute more to write Congress about this crucial legislation.
> Thank you.

Dear Chris,
Thank you so much for bringing this up.
It is very important to bring up what is happening to women in Saudi Arabia. There is actually a television
show there which teaches men "how to beat your wife"--have you heard of this? I saw portions of this show
and it is truly shocking. One of the warnings to men (who are expected to learn wife-beating) is "they'll
use their tears to try and stop you so beware" etc.
I should not single out Iran and I will not again for truly this is happening throughout Muslim world. I
write about Iran in same terms you do really--because what is being ignored in this focus on "WW3 wih Iran"
is the fact that so many Iranians are trying internally to not let the current regime overwhelm them--and
it just seems so much more logical and compassionate and real to support the internal struggles of the people
of Iran (at least by stating them/ not putting them on pg. 35 of newspaper--I mean, that doesn't seem to be
so much to ask but the media is really out of it in terms of reporting such very important issues)
rather than focusing on yet another war.
I agree with you completely!
Thank you for bringing this up!
If I find out in advance that there will be another broadcast of this television show in Saudi Arabia or if
I can find a link to it I will send it to this list.
Many thanks for your important addition to this topic!
Bobbi

Subject: Re: response to Bobbi Lurie

A woman from Iran spoke to me recently about the abuses she and other
Muslim women face, and also felt betrayed that the American media
mentions the abuse women face in Sunni Saudi Arabia even less than
the abuse women face in Iran. She fears for her safety and freedom in
her homeland, but told me that America's talk of "World War 3" with
Iran is just making matters worse back home. She suggested that
American's selectively singling out Iran (while generally letting
Saudi Arabia slide) made it clear, to her, that women's rights has
very little to do with the assault on her country as a roque state,
etc., by the Bush regime. It's a complex issue, but of course her
voice isn't going to be heard too much in the U.S.A. American media
either. She's not saying that American women shouldn't support, or
find ways to be in solidarity, with Iranian women in this struggle.
But why single out Iran and not, say, Saudi Arabia where the abuse is
just as bad?
Chris

I told a story about a cat dogs being like foreigners to me

but rather because she was that color and she liked to roll up
like one of those tightly braided rugs which made her coloring
at least the way she was folded made her colors fold up in an
unusually mottled way that resembled a large flat and beautiful
gray and silver rock with occasional lumps on it
which only added to her personality and that is also
the way I see people as not exactly lumpy but more like

reading on the 14th of December not in money of course

Here's another worthwhile initiative regarding the (DRC):

                                                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                    Massive New Rainforest Reserve Established in the
Democratic Republic of Congo

World's Largest Continuous Protected Area for Great Apes Protects The Endangered Bonobo
          Washington, DC - The Bonobo Conservation Initiative (BCI) joins the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in announcing the creation of the new Sankuru Nature Reserve, a huge rainforest area harboring the endangered bonobo, a great ape most closely related to humans. Larger than the state of Massachusetts, the new reserve encompasses 11,803 square miles of tropical rainforest, extremely rich in biodiversity.

"This is a monumental step towards saving a significant portion of the world's second largest rainforest, of critical importance to the survival not only of humankind's closest great ape relative, the bonobo, but to all life on Earth given the increasing threat of climate change," said Sally Jewell Coxe, president and co-founder of the Bonobo Conservation Initiative.

The Sankuru region was hit very hard during the recent war in the Congo, which devastated the local people and claimed four million lives-more than any war since WWII. In addition to the critical environmental challenges presented by unsustainable hunting, the humanitarian crisis must also be addressed. "The people of Sankuru rely on the forest for every aspect of their livelihood. Helping them to develop economic alternatives to the bushmeat trade is one of the most urgent priorities," Coxe said.

  In danger of extinction, bonobos (Pan paniscus) were the last great ape to be discovered and are the least known great ape species. Found only in the DRC, bonobos inhabit the heart of the Congo Basin, Africa's largest rainforest, which is threatened by the onslaught of industrial logging. Bonobos are distinguished by their peaceful, cooperative, matriarchal society, remarkable intelligence, and sexual nature. Other than humans, bonobos are the only primates known to have sex not only for procreation, but also for pleasure and conflict resolution-and with members of either sex. Unlike chimpanzees, bonobos do not murder or wage war on others of their own kind. They serve as a powerful flagship both for conservation and for peace.

In addition to the bonobo, the Sankuru Reserve contains the okapi (Okapia johnstoni), an exotic short necked forest giraffe also endemic to the DRC, but not previously found outside of their known range far to the northeast. Survey teams from the Congo's Center for Research in Ecology and Forestry (CREF) sponsored by BCI made this exciting discovery. Sankuru also contains elephants, which have been hunted out in many other areas of the Congo forest, plus at least 10 other species of primates, including the rare owl faced monkey and blue monkey.

The wildlife is under intense pressure from organized hunting for the commercial bushmeat trade. The report from the Congolese Institute for Conservation of Nature (ICCN) on its recent expedition to the area states that "the ecocide must be stopped" and recommends immediate action to protect this invaluable ecosystem and watershed. The DRC Minister of the Environment, Didace Pembe Bokiaga, who officially declared the new reserve, said, "This increases the total area of protected land in the DRC to 10.47%, bringing us closer to our goal of 15%. We are proud that the Sankuru Reserve is being created in the framework of community participative conservation...and will be zoned to guarantee the rights of the local population."

Andre Tosumba, director of BCI's Congolese NGO partner, ACOPRIK (Community Action for the Primates of Kasai), led the successful local effort to protect Sankuru. "When I saw the extent to which people were hunting bonobos, okapi, and elephants, we began to sensitize them to realize the value of these animals," he said. "Once they came to understand, the people themselves decided to stop hunting these precious species and to create a reserve to protect their forest. BCI has helped ACOPRIK and the local people at every step of the way; we call on the international community to join our effort."

Protecting Sankuru Reserve's forest will contribute significantly to mitigating global warming. Approximately 20% of annual green house gas emissions come from deforestation and other land-use change. Keeping this rich tropical forest intact will make an important contribution to global efforts to reduce emissions while simultaneously conserving biodiversity. The Sankuru Reserve stores up to 660 million tons of carbon, which if released by deforestation would emit up to 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, comparable to emissions from 38,000,000 cars per year for 10 years.

"This is a huge victory for bonobo and rainforest conservation," Coxe said. "However our work has just begun. Now we need investment to successfully manage the reserve. And, other areas need to be protected to ensure the long-term survival of the bonobo and the integrity of the Congo rainforest." The Sankuru Reserve is the southern anchor for a constellation of linked, community-based reserves being developed by BCI in the Bonobo Peace Forest, a project supported by DRC President Joseph Kabila since its inception in 2002.

                The Bonobo Conservation Initiative (BCI) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to the survival of the endangered bonobo (Pan paniscus) and its rainforest habitat in the Congo Basin. BCI works with indigenous Congolese people through cooperative conservation and community development programs and with the government of the DRC to establish new protected areas and to safeguard bonobos wherever they are found. BCI has been selected as a featured charity in the Catalogue for Philanthropy, for excellence, innovation and cost-effectiveness.

Initial support for this project has been provided by the Great Ape Conservation Fund, administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in collaboration with USAID's Central African Regional Program for the Environment.

To Ryan and others, ESPECIALLY those back channeled folks (why don't
people write ON the List?).

Some of you just didn't read the petition.  The petition, and the fast
itself was for Iraq.

Not only that, but, a genocide that happened 400+ years ago?  Are you
kidding me?  Do you ACTUALLY believe what we're doing in Iraq is NOT a
continuation?  (The massacre at Wounded Knee was in 1890 by the way)

What if there was oil in France and we wanted it?  And invaded?  NO
WAY would that be allowed!  The connection of chopping people of color
down for profit is so institutionalized we think it's something that
was done a long long LONG time ago.  WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT NOW!
Right?  We would NEVER even DREAM of going into a country that didn't
belong to us and kill, kill, kill, for profit.  Not NOW!

Someone said to me recently, "Condaleeza Rice isn't white."  And I
said, "True, but the corporate power structure she ultimately answers
to IS!"

The most common question was, "How do you think this is going to make
an impact?"  As though I thought this was going to STOP the war, or
something.

What's important it seems to me is to recreate this world as much as
possible, everyday if possible.  Traditions are as responsible as
anything to maintaining this murderous world.

To DO something different, especially with children, seems vital more
than ever.  To have us say NO to a meal drenched in lies from the
white anglo fatherhood feels very important.

Instead of course we're having MORE and MORE children in America and
submerging them, and ourselves in the nostalgia for holidays.  We
really NEED a break, we tell ourselves.  We're so stressed out.  OH
REALLY?  WELL HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF BAGHDAD, ARE THEY STRESSED OUT?
I had a coworker tell me the other day, "I just CANNOT read the
newspaper, it stresses me out, it's too depressing!  Besides, I want
to really ENJOY Christmas this year!  I want to watch Rudolph the Red
Nosed Reindeer with my nephew, REALLY ENJOY IT, you know?"

Stressed out!?  Who's stressed out more than the people of Iraq?

And now I'm sickened by the christmas shopping season that's only just begun.

How do we keep from vomiting every single fucking day?

NO WONDER there are (literally) HUNDREDS of Iraq War vets who come
home after their tour of duty only to leave in disgust, marry women in
other countries and denounce their US citizenship.

I feel like wearing black everyday, in mourning for the death of our
good sense.  And the death of our sense of responsibility.  The
American death toll reaches 4,000 in Iraq, the death toll of Iraqi
citizens climbs up to ONE MILLION.  That number just is impossible to
grasp.  A million human beings.  One million human beings.  What is
this coming down to a number thing?  How many poets?  How many
mothers?  How many ... something, something anything to make that
number seem MORE tangible.  To say one million ANYTHING is to put it
out of context.

Speaking of THANKSGIVING DINNER, and speaking of the denial of America
about its wars, have you ever seen the movie THE WAR AT HOME starring
Emilio Estevez, Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen, and Kimberly Williams.  I
don't often talk about movies, but this one really hits home with the
denial issues.

Will none of our elected officials do their jobs we hired them to do?
Didn't we hire the present congress to change things?  I feel like a
broken recorded.  But so is the country.  And there really is no one
to vote for for president.  Kucinich was my only hope, and he's no
hope because he'll never win the primary.  I'm voting for him anyway.
Voting booths should come equipped with vomit bags.  Or wear a shirt
with a pocket, or something.

The pieces that make up Anne Le Dressays second poetry collection, Old
Winter, are urban poems grounded in the rural past. Understated, direct,
ironic, quietly humorous, they reveal a love of the particular, of small
daily things which feel more and more fragile in a world overshadowed by
big threats. Descriptive or narrative, focussing on the inner world of
mind and spirit or the real world outside the narrator, these poems
celebrate in close and vivid detail the small moments of ordinary life.
They are poems of wonder, transformation, and resurrection.


And the meek shall inherit

Not this. Perhaps some post-
millenial earth where
lying low pays off in survival while
the loud and pushy get
clobbered.

Those who inherit this earth
are those who shout loudest, or who
simply take because they know
it's theirs.

If the meek inherit,
it's not anything as spacious or solid
or fecund as the earth.

Unless they taste it
in the dust kicked up
by the exuberant wheels of the true
inheritors taking off with their
inheritance.

Anne Le Dressay grew up in Manitoba, first on a farm near Virden and then
on an acreage outside Lorette. She has lived for extended periods in
Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Edmonton (in that order). She taught English and
Creative Writing for ten years in Alberta. She is now in Ottawa for the
seond time, working for the feds. She has been published sporadically
since the 1970s. She has one previous trade book, Sleep is a Country
(Harbinger, 1997) and two chapbooks, This Body That I Live In (Turnstone,
1979) and Woman Dreams (above/ground, 1998). She was also featured in the
anthology Decalogue: ten Ottawa poets (Chaudiere Books, 2006).

(At my blogspot and in various entries are links and examples of
painting, street art, grafitti, stencils etc from Iran and yesterday
the following interview from June 12, 2007 with the Iranian (woman)
poet, translator, journalist and editor
  Farideh Hassanzadeh
	
Post: Interview & Poetry with Iranian Poet Farideh Hassanzadeh (also
with poem "Isn't it Enough")
Link: http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2007/11/interview-with-iranian-poet-farideh.html

	which is also at:
	
http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4300 ---)

There's a common kind of man's undershirt familiarly known in America
as "a wife-beater." A white, ribbed one with thin straps rather than
sleeves.  You see them all the time, and that really is their often
affectionately pronounced sobriquet.

     Every 9 seconds a woman is assaulted in the USA, rape and
violence against women and children is on the rise from their already
astronomical rates of occurence, and if you take a look at American tv
with or without cable access,  one could compile a pretty incredible
"teaching manual" on how to do everything from threatening and
harassing a woman, young girl or female child via every known media of
communication to "BTK"--"bind, torture, kill" as the MO of a
particular serial killer is known by--and beyond that, into ever more
precise, horrific, forensic detail on methods of degradation,
humiliation, and sexual "freak ons" leading to prolonged periods of
gruesome and scientifically controlled sufferings. And in many cases,
it will turn out that not even the corpse is safe from further
dismemberment and sexual assault.  All interlarded with chirpy ads for
deodorant, diets, dogfood, previews of shows with screaming headlines
like "who will bomb Iran first?" "our nation is threatened by hordes
of illegal aliens! act now!" "will Brittany even be allowed to see her
children?"  "the Private Diana as told by her sons" and "Why Torture
is Necessary."

Today is the Biggest Shopping Day of the Year.  But that's just in
stores.  Right here as I write for five bucks you can go behind a
dumpster with a woman, and for a good day's pay, get a motel room,
some dope and a woman and try out just about everything you've seen on
tv, in porno, been told about. And do you think anyone's really even
going to care or do much of anything about it, in this enlightened and
free land?
      As long as no property is damaged--no.

You don't even need tv  to learn this stuff---men get to learn it from
their fathers, uncles, brothers, friends. "Everybody does it.  Got to
keep the ***** in line."

Of course there is not much interest in the "internal struggles of the
Iranian people."  No one in America had any such interest in what the
Shah did--our beloved, CIA installed Shah--to his people. Wasn't that
the "Peacock Throne" or some such we bestowed on him? I remember
meeting many of his former subjects who sought refuge--their bodies
scarred by his torturers. The fools!  They didn't believe in the
"right of Royalty," even when it was a gift from a democracy!
       And what did we do for the Iranian people when those ungrateful
ones had a Revolution?  Why we got our old also American installed
buddy Saddam Hussein to go to war for almost a decade with Iran,
supplied with our chemical, biological weapons and massive hordes of
tanks, bombs, material of all sorts and billions in funding.  Millions
of Iraqis and Iranians died in that war, which included the biggest
tank battle ever fought, and huge Iranian casualties from bio and
chemical weapons assaults, "Made in USA" .
     When that horrific attempt was not enough, it seems like Nukes
might just be next on the menu, don't you think?  And we better be
quick about it!--after all we've spent 17 years now destroying
Iraq--can't waste any more time, troops, trillions of debt.
     The landscape of Iraq and parts of Iran are so toxic from the
American depleted uranium weapons used on the populaces there that
cancers and new forms of diseases have been carrying out silent deadly
daily warfare just as effective as bombings in their effects through
time and generations.  The landscapes of Afghanistan, Lebanon and
Palestine have also been blessed with the contributions of American
weaponry which destroys the environment as well as the human
bio-chemical -nervous system.

The Iranians are surrounded by nuclear powers--Israel, Russia, China,
Pakistan, India. Remember when Saddam was able to attack with WMDS
within 45 minutes--London? maybe the USA?  And now of course Iran,
despite lack of any evidence-- is the most dangerous regime on the
planet.  Maybe they have discovered Kryptonite!

      And who are our dear allies?  Besides the Saudis, such other
beacons of tolerance and freedom as Pakistan and Israel, along with
the stray Emirate or two--

       Are "dissident elements" within Iran to greet us bearing
flowers the way the Iraqis were supposed to do?

       Do you suppose they really think we stand for liberty, equality
of the sexes, the right to a free trial, the right to privacy and
freedom of speech, the right to organize workers or receive universal
health care?

       Which kinds of wife beating does anyone think the world is
supposed to actually find preferable?  "Ours"?--Is there really some
kind of competition being held for "our" judgement on the world's tvs
in this department?

      This is a world wide atrocity, not "theirs" alone.  I realize
somehow the USA unilaterally or with a few others in a "coalition of
the willing" miraculously seems no longer "of this world" in terms of
having to be responsable to the Conventions of Human Rights, so
perhaps it's pointless to even ask these questions.
       Maybe what one sees and hears here (right here) everyday is
really "better" than what goes on "over there."
      Stoning people!! How barbaric!  Can't this be done the much more
civilized way, the way we do it?  Don't you think we should invade,
murder, rape, loot, poison, starve. kidnap and detain indefinetly,
torture and destroy these Evil Ones, teach them all the Right Way to
Live?
       Introduce them to some really civilized television?  Force them
to read and write some "radical, experimental" poetry to "shock and
awe" them into our higher state of consciousness?  Make the men all
wear wife-beaters?

      Someday hopefully the USA will remember it is part of the same
planet and be interested in being an example of a real equality of
women--including equal pay for equal work-- rather than the world's
Number One Wife Beater, Blower-Upper, Widow Maker, Child Robber,
Poisoner, Starver, Humiliator, and Dictator of Life, Liberty and the
Pursuit of Power, Greed and Resources.  For men, to be sure.
      Yes maybe someday it will be remembered the women of America are
also on the same planet where these atrocities occur, and are also
living and dying from them.

Here is a poem by
Farideh Hassanzadeh, who, incidentally, edited an anthology of
Contemporary American Poetry to appear in Iran this year.


ISN'T IT ENOUGH?
I gave up love
being satisfied with the quiet of shadows
And memories.

Time was past, lost,
moments exploded
by the rain of bombs.

At nightfall
I don't brush my dreams any more.
At nightfall
I don't care for the wandering sun any more.

At nightfall
I leave the frightened moon in the sky
to shelter under the ground.

I am neither a woman nor a poet any more.

Night by night
more and more,
I feel real.

Like the bloody sound of alarms,
Like the roaring anti-aircraft rounds,
Like the falling bombs and rockets,
which turn the ruins and ashes
into eternal reality;
I feel night by night more real
and old,

so old and real that in the mirror
I see nothing anymore
but an aisle of empty chairs.

Oh, isn't it enough?
What does a man need
more than a loaf of bread,
a quiet night
and an armful of bleak love,
for giving up and being satisfied
with the quiet of shadows
and memories?

This is a reply to David Chirot's indictment of American treatment of
American women & girls; Bobbi Lurie knows I sympathize w/ her concern for  Iranian
(Muslim) women & girls.  In fact, I offered serious help  to a merchant-class
Marxist family of daughters during the time of  Khomeini, a story I shall tell
some night around a campfire. Last night I was  out for a drink & a taxi ride
-- we were in obvious danger, so obvious, no  one remarked it.  Yes, because no
t only are clubs considered to be  dangerous places, where women are courting
violence if it happens to them, and  so serve as their own alibi, but because
that club in particular has been known  to be the site of conflict -- it is a
place where men & women both have  struck out & against men & women both.
What are the chances, but I  was traveling with three women, two of whom had
been hit by women at that  club.  I mention this to create a sense of what our
peace & dancing  were all about last night, in the eye of the storm.  Later, we
had to wait  at a convenience store -- also site of American violence -- while
the police  called our cab, since our own efforts to summon a cab had done
little good (all  of us had planned not to drive), and we were destined to have
to wait there  until 3 in the morning, in wool & furs.  We were caught out
late,  protecting the public from the dimwittedness of driving on martinis.
Because the cop helped us get a cab faster, we talked w/ him about his
philosophy -- he was a young man & non-drinker -- regarding arresting party  goers; he
said he was more likely to arrest a crying woman.  I started  eating Fritos in
front of him, as if I were intently listening.  We  were in the quiet, sweet,
and sleepy heart of lake land, in Orono,  a town so expensive, if you were to
peek along the driveways &  shoreline, you wouldn't know or suspect what goes
on there -- you wouldn't want  to suspect; Iranians themselves wouldn't want
to suspect.  But about which  we know, because of the divorces and women's
shelters and drop-out prevention  and treatment programs.  AMB

One of the songs we heard last night:

HONKY TONK WOMEN
(Jagger/Richards)
I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis,
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my  mind.
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
I laid a divorcee in New York City,
I had to put up some kind of a fight.
The lady then she covered me with roses,
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind.
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
(Yeah!)  It's the honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
(Yeah!)  It's the honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk  blues.

I did a quick search for something along the lines of what Barry asked
about, and just an Oxford UP book by Vincent Sherry called The Great War
and the Language of Modernism (2003) seems tangentially to address the
issue.  What an interesting question, though, about modernist poets in
the foreign service (I'm interested in the history of what poets have
tended to do for money).  And these aren't modernists, but perhaps
they're part of the geneology nonetheless:   Chaucer, who was some kind
of foreign minister for both Richard II and Henry IV, and Thomas Wyatt,
who likewise did foreign errands for Henry VIII. =20

I've enjoyed attenuated limbic activity over the past week -- must be the
meat.

Anyhow, I'm thinking about stuff.  So here's the list; let's know if you're
game for expansion ---

- Human rights are sexy.  We should convice the ayatollah (sp?) and the cia
that they're repugnant.  Who's with me?
- Of course, womens' rights are significantly more sexy than human rights,
in general, but, correct me, is our US Court System's unofficial (official?)
definition of pornography: "We know it when we see it?"
- I may have made two point in the previous one. (I actually thought about
this point the most.)
- You know, I just realized (that besides the fact that, gosh darnit, people
like me) is after all, Star Wars is not really a space movie or a futurist
movie, but actually a western movie masquerading as a russian novel !!
- Honk if you want a list of url's to actual Space Westerns at the
listenlight uri: http://listenlight.net (uri == (equals) uniform resource
identifier (fyi = (is) for your information: awesome.))
- I've spent all day mystery science theaterring everything from Fantastic
Four to the latest Diane Keaton movie to the big KUMU game.
- And I feel fine.

I can quite understand Islamic women fighting for justice feeling betrayed
by the American government and medea. But I find this idea that American
feminism has "betrayed" Islamic women somewhat troubling. It may or may not
be true - I am not familiar enough with the area, and of course there are
fools in every area of study - but I would point out that Christina Hoff
Sommers lists herself as being part of the American Enterprise Institute.
And that the AEI is a well-known neocon think tank.

http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/1431

Among others things, they are funded by Exxon - and notoriously offered cash
to scientists to undermine a UN report on climate change

http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/feb/02/frontpagenews.climatechange

So I would suggest a little scepticism is in order, at least. I find it hard
to believe that any sensible feminist would ignore or be unmoved by
misogynistic violence in the Islam world.

All best

A Freudian slip! Of course I meant "media", not "medea". Make of that what
you will.

All,

i'm proposing a winter term (a 3-work course that mixes book learning with practical
learning, often some kind of service work, but not necessarily) to go and study plantation
systems in Martinique. i'd like to meet up with any Martinican poets, novelists, memorists,

i'd be accompanied by approximately 20 students & 2 chauffeurs.

journalists, photographers, visual artists, who deal, in some way, with the continued
colonization of Martinique and/or the plantation system.

does anyone have any knowledge/contact of any artists there i could be in touch with?

please backchannel any info.

greatly (early) appreciative,

Metta

The Elizabethan world was full of poets in the foreign service. Christopher
Marlowe, Walter Raleigh, to name just two obvious ones.

And of course Spenser wrote the Faerie Queene as propaganda more or less on
the order of Queen Elizabeth to glorify her dream of world domination. So h=
e
as many others worked in public relations. Elizabeth changed her mind about
taking on Spain after Drake took the Armada. Spenser was far from completin=

his poem and more or less committed to it. He spent the rest of his life in
virtual exile on an estate in Ireland that Elizabeth =B3rewarded=B2 him with.

I did a quick search for something along the lines of what Barry asked
about, and just an Oxford UP book by Vincent Sherry called The Great War
and the Language of Modernism (2003) seems tangentially to address the
issue.  What an interesting question, though, about modernist poets in
the foreign service (I'm interested in the history of what poets have
tended to do for money).  And these aren't modernists, but perhaps
they're part of the geneology nonetheless:   Chaucer, who was some kind
of foreign minister for both Richard II and Henry IV, and Thomas Wyatt,
who likewise did foreign errands for Henry VIII. =3D20

I remember Paz saying first poets were couriers then they were diplomats

they are professors--so around Paz's time & before you will find many.

David,
It's true (on all levels) that humanity basically sucks.
The rarest thing in this world is a decent person.
So of course there are wife beaters in this country and all else that you mention--most
certainly--very scary.
But wife beating is not instituionalized on a national level here/ there are no t.v. shows
here on "how to beat your wife"--that doesn't mean it doesn't happen--but what it means
is "group mind" "tribal mind" "groupthink" has not taken hold on that scariest of levels in that
particular arena--though of course one cannot deny the U.S. suffers from it in other ways
("herd mentality" I mean--of course it does).


And I never mentioned any type of "intervention" or sense of "superiority" --all countries
sin most terribly--for they are made up of humans "following orders"--no exceptions...
I only reported what I heard 2 Iranian women saying: THEY were asking for American feminists
to help them and they were painfully frustrated by the fact that they did not receive a response--

that's all I said--I'm glad Chris brought up fact that the abuses these particular Iranian women
spoke about happen throughout the Muslim world--he brought up Saudi Arabia specifically
(yes, one of "our allies") and I was glad he did because I had just seen a segment on "how to beat your
wife" t.v. show in Saudi Arabia. So my post was only about "awareness" (and I wrote it because I felt
ashamed by what these 2 Iranian women said about American feminists failing them)
I'm not going to mention that Ahmadinejad claims to be The Messiah (12th Imam) for this post is about
sleeveless t-shirts and no way I'll bring up Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust because it
breaks my heart how little people seem to care about this.

There's a common kind of man's undershirt familiarly known in America
as "a wife-beater." A white, ribbed one with thin straps rather than
sleeves.  You see them all the time, and that really is their often
affectionately pronounced sobriquet.

     Every 9 seconds a woman is assaulted in the USA, rape and
violence against women and children is on the rise from their already
astronomical rates of occurence, and if you take a look at American tv
with or without cable access,  one could compile a pretty incredible
"teaching manual" on how to do everything from threatening and
harassing a woman, young girl or female child via every known media of
communication to "BTK"--"bind, torture, kill" as the MO of a
particular serial killer is known by--and beyond that, into ever more
precise, horrific, forensic detail on methods of degradation,
humiliation, and sexual "freak ons" leading to prolonged periods of
gruesome and scientifically controlled sufferings. And in many cases,
it will turn out that not even the corpse is safe from further
dismemberment and sexual assault.  All interlarded with chirpy ads for
deodorant, diets, dogfood, previews of shows with screaming headlines
like "who will bomb Iran first?" "our nation is threatened by hordes
of illegal aliens! act now!" "will Brittany even be allowed to see her
children?"  "the Private Diana as told by her sons" and "Why Torture
is Necessary."

Today is the Biggest Shopping Day of the Year.  But that's just in
stores.  Right here as I write for five bucks you can go behind a
dumpster with a woman, and for a good day's pay, get a motel room,
some dope and a woman and try out just about everything you've seen on
tv, in porno, been told about. And do you think anyone's really even
going to care or do much of anything about it, in this enlightened and
free land?
      As long as no property is damaged--no.

You don't even need tv  to learn this stuff---men get to learn it from
their fathers, uncles, brothers, friends. "Everybody does it.  Got to
keep the ***** in line."

Of course there is not much interest in the "internal struggles of the
Iranian people."  No one in America had any such interest in what the
Shah did--our beloved, CIA installed Shah--to his people. Wasn't that
the "Peacock Throne" or some such we bestowed on him? I remember
meeting many of his former subjects who sought refuge--their bodies
scarred by his torturers. The fools!  They didn't believe in the
"right of Royalty," even when it was a gift from a democracy!
       And what did we do for the Iranian people when those ungrateful
ones had a Revolution?  Why we got our old also American installed
buddy Saddam Hussein to go to war for almost a decade with Iran,
supplied with our chemical, biological weapons and massive hordes of
tanks, bombs, material of all sorts and billions in funding.  Millions
of Iraqis and Iranians died in that war, which included the biggest
tank battle ever fought, and huge Iranian casualties from bio and
chemical weapons assaults, "Made in USA" .
     When that horrific attempt was not enough, it seems like Nukes
might just be next on the menu, don't you think?  And we better be
quick about it!--after all we've spent 17 years now destroying
Iraq--can't waste any more time, troops, trillions of debt.
     The landscape of Iraq and parts of Iran are so toxic from the
American depleted uranium weapons used on the populaces there that
cancers and new forms of diseases have been carrying out silent deadly
daily warfare just as effective as bombings in their effects through
time and generations.  The landscapes of Afghanistan, Lebanon and
Palestine have also been blessed with the contributions of American
weaponry which destroys the environment as well as the human
bio-chemical -nervous system.

The Iranians are surrounded by nuclear powers--Israel, Russia, China,
Pakistan, India. Remember when Saddam was able to attack with WMDS
within 45 minutes--London? maybe the USA?  And now of course Iran,
despite lack of any evidence-- is the most dangerous regime on the
planet.  Maybe they have discovered Kryptonite!

      And who are our dear allies?  Besides the Saudis, such other
beacons of tolerance and freedom as Pakistan and Israel, along with
the stray Emirate or two--

       Are "dissident elements" within Iran to greet us bearing
flowers the way the Iraqis were supposed to do?

       Do you suppose they really think we stand for liberty, equality
of the sexes, the right to a free trial, the right to privacy and
freedom of speech, the right to organize workers or receive universal
health care?

       Which kinds of wife beating does anyone think the world is
supposed to actually find preferable?  "Ours"?--Is there really some
kind of competition being held for "our" judgement on the world's tvs
in this department?

      This is a world wide atrocity, not "theirs" alone.  I realize
somehow the USA unilaterally or with a few others in a "coalition of
the willing" miraculously seems no longer "of this world" in terms of
having to be responsable to the Conventions of Human Rights, so
perhaps it's pointless to even ask these questions.
       Maybe what one sees and hears here (right here) everyday is
really "better" than what goes on "over there."
      Stoning people!! How barbaric!  Can't this be done the much more
civilized way, the way we do it?  Don't you think we should invade,
murder, rape, loot, poison, starve. kidnap and detain indefinetly,
torture and destroy these Evil Ones, teach them all the Right Way to
Live?
       Introduce them to some really civilized television?  Force them
to read and write some "radical, experimental" poetry to "shock and
awe" them into our higher state of consciousness?  Make the men all
wear wife-beaters?

      Someday hopefully the USA will remember it is part of the same
planet and be interested in being an example of a real equality of
women--including equal pay for equal work-- rather than the world's
Number One Wife Beater, Blower-Upper, Widow Maker, Child Robber,
Poisoner, Starver, Humiliator, and Dictator of Life, Liberty and the
Pursuit of Power, Greed and Resources.  For men, to be sure.
      Yes maybe someday it will be remembered the women of America are
also on the same planet where these atrocities occur, and are also
living and dying from them.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:


Tisa Bryant & Lisa Robertson

Friday, November 30, 2007
Timken Lecture Hall     7:30 p.m.
Refreshments will be served

Join us!


Tisa Bryant's first immersions into poetry took place in her native
Boston and beloved Cambridge, MA, but we are glad to have her back in
the Bay Area where, she says, "her writing found her in good company
and took shape."  After several years working as an admin, curator,
workshop instructor, and bookstore clerk, often in the same week, she
left San Francisco for Brown University, where she earned an MFA in
fiction in 2004.  Then she attended Naropa's Summer Writing Program as
a Zora Neale Hurston fellow. She now teaches at St. John's University
in Queens, NY, and lives in Brooklyn.  Bryant's work, which either
traverses or tramples the boundaries of genre, culture and official
history, has appeared in The Believer, Chain, Curve, Hatred of
Capitalism, Pom2, XCP, and in gallery exhibitions for visual artist
Laylah Ali. She is the author of Tzimmes (chapbook), from A+Bend
Press, and is co-editor/publisher of the snazzy new hardcover annual
The Encyclopedia Project.  SPT is proud to celebrate her book debut
from Leon Works, Unexplained Presence.

An American border official recently asked Lisa Robertson what it is
like to be in limbo. In the past four years she has lived in
Vancouver, San Diego, Paris, the Vienne region of France, and
Berkeley.  This year she is teaching at CCA. Her most recent book is
The Men (Bookthug, Toronto). Limbo is hard on dogs.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
There's no better time to join SPT!
Check out:  http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm

"Foreign Service" may be thought of as a shifting terrain of
activities, contingent on the time period, and for whom and where to
the poet is "sent on a mission" for their particular government.  A
diplomatic assignment to a specific mission might entail the gathering
of information--cultural, political, economic, social,  "under the
radar" gossip and intrigue and the like.  A seemingly benign series of
city poems or pastorals, to the trained eye, might be a very good
conveyance for some valuable strategic informations re sites, roads,
types of landscapes, metereological conditions at different times of
the day and seasons, the types of water way uses being employed, the
distribution of police and military centers, the welfare of a
populace.  A writer--poet, essayist, journalist, fictioneer--witting
or unwittingly may provide an excellent "foreign agent."  They may
even become--knowingly or unknowingly-- in espionage, disemination of
propaganda, disinformations, subtle introductions of "dissident"
thoughts via a "dissonant poetics" or a "black ops" plan to "find
evidence" that has been planted for them to "discover" "by chance," or
because they have the "poet's keen eye for detail" and the like.

    The foreign service poet may or not be an agent of colonialism,
Orientalism, a collector of objets d'art for private collections or
museums of the homeland, the benign chronicler, daily journaler,
letter writer,  photographer of sites and events closed to the general
public, useful to those in charge of the poet's mission, or their
bosses back at Centcom somewhere else in the outposts or centers of
empire, of commerce, of "research and development."  The notes of a
poet might provide excellent information for various trading
companies, an "in" on the local market, gossip and rumors about future
construction projects, plans for museums and libraries which just
might be a source of potential investments, incomes, informations.



    The poet in the Foreign Service rummaging around in the old dusty
libraries and state collections might have the opportunity to
substitute forged documents for originals, thereby gaining ownership
of the valuable for the homeland's collections, or those private
collections belonging to his "artistic circle"--, or--planting the
seeds of a falsified historical "proof" to be used at some point as
"evidence" in a territorial dispute. or the filing of claims demanding
the return of objects of value suddenly endowed with a different chain
of "provenance," pointing to citizens of one's homeland, or, again,
friends via artistic/financial  circles and the like.

     The poet consigned to some seemingly distant and humble,
worthless outpost--may instead be the eyes and ears for a future
greatly valued first "foot in the door" of an as yet unknown of form
of industrial development, resources acquisitions, planning of a
military invasion site.

     Or the poet may turn agent against their own country, finding the
new post much more to their liking than the boring and repressive
status of being a poet in the "old country."  The poet may simply
defect--but soon enough they are used in some manner by the new
country to prove how much "better" they are than the old.

       (In this manner, to be sure, they are much more greatly feted
in the adopted country than they were in the old.  The member of
another's foreign service who prefers to be "one of us" rather than
"one of them"--what an endorsement!!  What a sign of one's "superior
culture"!
--What a feather in Mussolini's Fascist hat to have the great Ezra
Pound broadcasting on the  radio, at work in the foreign service
aspects of dissemination of propaganda to American troops.)

     Foreign service may also provide the poet/writer with an
education regarding the injustices committed by one's country as
colonizer, exploiter, destroyer of another.  The poet may become a
rebel, an "internationalist," a "voice against oppression" by their
own and/or other countries in the area--and around the world-- to
which they are assigned.  And this in turn may lead to the opening of
eyes vis-a-vis the country of origin.

        The Foreign Service as Foreign Legion:  Archilocus, pioneer of
the Lyric poem, of the Iambic, of the epigram, a great artist of the
insult, of black humor, of satire,  bastard son of an upper class
father and a slave--a mercenary solidier by trade, a poet by vocation.
A person with a surpassing understanding of the meanings and terms of
"foreign service" while inventing new meanings and terms in poetry--
literally and literarially--a member of the "advance guard"  "fighting
at the forefront" "a wielder of pen and sword," so to speak, "putting
his life on the line"--and in the line, of poems--and with a "basic
understanding" of the "value of life and death" and the
mortality/immortality of verses.

      Think of some of the strange birds who have been in the Foreign
Service and poets--Sir Walter Raleigh, Christopher Marlowe, as part of
the long British tradition of this,  a great number of Latin and
French poets, think of Victor Segalen, for example, with his STELES,
or--Rimbaud--who stopped writing in order to live out what his
writings describe in advance--the life of Foreign Service as an
explorer and merchant in the employ of Empire, contributor to
Geographic journals,  at the confluence of spheres of influence and
struggle among local war lords and leaders--Menelek, the Mahdi--and
the Europeans--Italian, French and English.

(The descendents of Christopher Marlowe:  Conrad's Marlow in "Heart of
Darkness" narrating his tale seated, shrouded in darkness and looking
not unlike an Eastern idol,  with his close and  powerful friends in
the rivers of the Thames as it opens out to the oceans of Empire--and
Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, the chivalric knight of LA, who
"down these mean streets . . . must go," the "private eye" navigating
among the outlaws and the official police, damsels in distress and
figures of power, to return to his rooms for a solitary game of chess.
 In the morning papers, for both Marlowe,s no mention of their names
for their "foreign" services, except to you--"hypocrite reader" of the
poet's "Flowers of Evil".)


      The "deep cover" of the ambiguity of Foreign Service employ of
poets and writers should not be overlooked.  What better place to hide
such an ambiguous  agent than in plain site/sight/cite?

       The deep concern for this ambiguity of poets in/on Foreign
Service is evidenced in the paranoia/real politik of the Pentagon
assigned translators and Pentagon approved translations of the poetry
allowed to be read by Americans and written by "enemy combattants"
detained indefinetily without charge at the torture prison camp in
Guantanamo.  Are the words these "Foreign Servants" are
writing--poems--or coded messages?

        Suddenly the Pentagon is finding itself in the role of
Formalist Critic.  One can imagine the great "anxiety of influence" at
work in the consideration of these verses!  How is one to determine
among the New Critical "seven types of ambiguity" and/or the kinds of
"complex, ambiguous" verse advocated by Charles Bernstein?

      This "anxiety of influence" (--of being "influenced" by
sympathy, by empathy--"in spite of" the "bad poetry" by "bad people"
in "bad translations'" attitude of many "authoritative" American poets
and critics)--has been extended to the reception of these poems, in
which the reader is encouraged to be afraid of or angry, disdainful,
dismissive of these poets and their poems.

      The poet employed in the Foreign Service--opens the
possibilities of thinking on the questions of complicity and duplicity
which haunt the interrelationships of writers, readers of poetry with
language itself, and of language's terms of employment, literally and
literarially.

 In being employed in the "Foreign Service"--the relationships among
poetry and the State, and States and States, State Terror and
anti-State terrorisms, State Languages and anti-State Languages--
one's "native" and "foreign" languages--one's "poetic" and "public"
languages--become at once more "openly revealed" and more
"clandistinely concealed."

      And in this increasingly "high stakes" environment--physically,
mentally, spiritually as one wills--one begins to encounter such
aspects of language as its "confessional" nature.  A "freely given"
"confessional poetry"--or one extracted by means of torture or via the
uses of "the interrogation of language"?  And are these necessarily
all that different? Is the "confession" "true"--or "saying what is
wanted/demanded to be heard"?
      And again, what is the "truth value" of poetry employed "in the
Foreign Service"?  And when does "working in the Foreign Service" mean
working for one's government within one's own country?  Are not
"dissident poets" ones consider to be working for a/some Power other
than that of the interests of the State, and so in this sense "Foreign
Agents"?

     And what is a more hideous form of the "suppression of freedom of
speech and writing" in terms of poetry and Foreign Service--the
banning or censorship of certain poetries and poets--or--the forcing
them to speak, to write?  (And once this is extracted, to alter it,
mis/distranslate it, edit it in various maniuplated ways.)

     In a very real sense, one need not even leave one's "homeland" to
be working in the employ of its "Foreign Service."

      And to what extent is one not working in the "Foreign Service"
of one's country, State, institutions, when one is being "supported
by," given grants by or having air fare and fees covered by--various
State or private institutions to attend conferences in other
countries? To what extent is the poet promoting an agenda which in
some way is not linked to the Power of the State, the power of the
State's language?

      Ambiguity, opacity,  complexity, of language versus the "direct,
transparent" forms--which one is actually more suited to the "Foreign
Service" employ of the State?  When do the critiques for and against
the "poetry of witness" become debates on the "truth value" of
"poetry" over that of the "witness" to such an extent that the
question of "whose" Foreign Service one is employed by becomes an
issue?  To what extent does a demand for a rigorous, radical, purified
Formalism evidence a strategy of "Security"?  That is, a poetry which
may be counted on to be on the side of (Homeland) Security, complicit
with it, or at least not "resistant" to it.
    One may posit a poetry of Security in which the "poetry of
witness" becomes a "poetry of surveillance."  And a Poetry of
Surveillance which becomes a method of reading "with an eye" ( a
Panoptic Eye--perhaps--the  reversal of the old Transparent Eyeball
floating over the Green of Concord--)  for any writing which is
"coded" for the benefit of the anti-State terrorists on the "outside".
      On the one hand, a "mainstream" "official" confessional kind of
poetry, in which by its very transparency and "directness" "innocence"
is laid bare--and on the other, a poetry of opacity, complexity,
ambiguity, which, by its insistence on a Formal "purity" from the
"confessional I/eye"--becomes another form of asserting one is
"telling the truth," is "innocent," because unlike the naive,
"mainstream," poets one is not advocating something as "relative" as
"witness," but instead the Formal "purity" of a "material" poetry,
"absent" the "I".
      (While also maintaining the authorial status quo by being signed
as "written by me,
So-and-So."  After all,  one may get rid of "I"--but there still
remain "me" and "myself".  After all, how else to collect accolades,
compensations, awards, positions, some form of reward or recognition?
Does "anyone" "really" want to become the "no one" and "every one" of
"Killroy was here"?  It is one thing to write "about" the anonymous
poet-prisoner's scrawls on the walls of the torture cells--but who
really wants to be that poet IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN anonymous?-Use of
capitals due to lack of italics--)

      So in thinking of poets and Foreign Service, may one not say
--"yes, but a list of them  are only those one 'knows about,' only
those of whom there is a record and recognition of having been so
employed."

      After all, may not language itself ask of its writers and
speakers--how much do "you" think you "know" of language?  How much do
"you" think "you" "control" language?

      For example, the famous "16 words" used by Bush and Colin Powell
as a "proof"  for the need for the invasion and occupation of
Iraq--turned out to be forged by literal  "foreign agents" and in turn
were informed on as forgeries by agents foreign and domestic.  Yet,
spoken despite all this by Colin Powell, did not millions believe
them?

   And, born of forgery, by "writers" in the employ of Foreign
services, were not the poets of Guantanamo's poems finally allowed to
be produced, via torture, censorship, "neutral/neutered" translations
as examples of the struggle between State Terror and terrorists of
Foreign Services, between poetries of "us" and "them," between
poetries of (dubious, of course) "enemy combattant" "witness" and
those of "Formal Quality" from within the boundaries of "Homeland
Security"?

     Perhaps among the reasons for so few American poets being in the
American Foreign Service compared to those of many other countries,
there may be the assumption that Americans poets are ALREADY in the
"Foreign Service" whereever and whenever and however they travel
abroad to give readings, attend conferences, keep journals, meet other
nations' poets, take fotos, record by audio or video the talks and
readings, homes, life styles of other poets in other lands. By the
very nature of these not being censored, suppressed, debriefed, they
become widely available in print, on line, via the ever more openly
and legally  surveilled exchanges via phones, emails, postal services
and, if need be, searches considered not untoward at airports, sea
ports, or of one's home, without the need for any warrants, as "a
matter of routine."
      In such a transparency, it no longer matters if poetry is opaque
or clear, complex and ambiguous or "plain and simple."  All that
matters is that any form of communication may be construed as
"suspicious" or not, in the employ of "their" Foreign Service or
"ours."
     And so, without need of much coercion  at all, American poets may
safely go about the business of being in both the Homeland Security
and the Foreign Service without needing to be named, recognized or
paid as such.

To conclude with some lines of Archilochus:

The fox knows many tricks,
the hedgehog only one.
A good one.

That would mean 3 and a half million incidents a year, and since
there are a great many repeats, probably amounts to about a third of
a percent of women being victimized. Seems extremely unlikely, tho it
would be nice to think the incidence that low. Where did you get your
statistic?

Dear Bobbie:

i was talking last night on the phone with my mother about the need to be c=
ontinually checking on the provenance of sources which one finds--in any me=
dia--
the literature on this need is growing continually--as there is a huge amou=
nt of "information" available which has to be traced back to its sources in=
 order to have an idea how accurate it is,  it even true at all--as well as=
 all the "grey areas" of distortion, selectivity, dis/mistranslations, edit=
s, omissions, "echo chamber effects" and the like--

i was happy to find alison croggin's post regarding this today as it is an =
example of how  research into the background of "signs taken for wonders" a=
s Karl Marx called such things, may often be found to be  "too good to be t=
rue"--

i went and looked up the sites you listed here, and they all turn out to be=
 of a dubious nature in one way or another--

the original source turns out to be MEMRI TV--

if you check for example the wikipedia entry on MEMRI--this is an organizat=
ion which has been widely criticized and questioned by persons in many coun=
tries--as to the integrity of their information in all facets of media--

as in any period of war, one needs to be aware of how much propaganda, fear=
 and hate mongering, distortions, lies, becomes the norm--

there are billions beyond billions of dollars, not to mention euros and yua=
n and yen--at stake in these conflicts--in order to ensure that the support=
 of populations is there for the huge corporations and interests, industrie=
s which profit from the war machines, it is necessary that as many persons =
as possible believe the most damning lies about other populations whether i=
t is in terms of religion,ideology, ethnicity, culture or that all embracin=
g term "way of life"--"the clash of civilizations"--"barbarism and civiliza=
tion"--such fundamentalist views are required to make persons blind deaf an=
d dumb in regarding the being of other beings as anything but "the enemy," =
"the personification of evil"--

the idea is that one will no longer see the other as something worth more t=
han extermination--as much as possible--

so the images, sounds, texts one is shown are those which are designed to s=
how such others in the worst possible light--

which is the way that the actions of MEMRI are seen to be created and funct=
ioning by its critics--

in the film Blue Collar (with Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel, Yaphet Kotto am=
ong others)--there is a character who explains that power functions by sett=
ing people against each other--the rich against the poor, the Black against=
 the White, the old against the young--even the Union can be made to turn o=
n Union members--(the film was made before Reagan began to break the unions=
  with his firing of all the air controllers)-- become a tool of those agai=
nst unions--anything to destroy the idea of unity, solidarity--among person=
s in the face of power and profit--

WHAT TO DO WHEN THE SHIT HITS THE FAN
by Dave Black
Skyhorse Publishing, 2007
$12.95

Have you seen this book? It's a comprehensive guide to surviving
disasters such as nuclear bombs, terrorist attacks and civil unrest,
and it's in all the chain bookstores these days, shelved under HOME
REFERENCE, right next to Martha Stewart's books on how to make bird
feeders and the perfect door knocker from old broom handles. There's a
"small arms primer" section where Black informs us, "Experts pretty
much agree that 9 mm is as small as you should go, and anything larger
than a .38 Special or .357 Magnum is too big. Other considerations to
make are price, your physical size, and hand strength. Revolvers are
safer than semi-automatics, but semi-automatics are quicker to load
and easier to conceal."

Having grown up in a family where every man, woman and child learns
how to shoot pistols, rifles and shotguns, and uses them on a regular
basis, I'm not unfamiliar with the language, just no longer
comfortable with it. In fact I am the only living member of my family
to NOT own a gun, which freaks some of my family out, saying they
worry about me, gunless.

He has a "body armor" section where he tells us, "Body armor has
changed over the decades to the point where now it's possible to get
reasonable protection in a vest made from soft woven fibers. This
'soft armor' is more tailored than traditional armor, making it easy
to conceal and comfortable to wear." Black also covers how to survive
a shipwreck, nuclear emergency, tornado, earthquake and other cheerful
outcomes for your day. There's no doubt that this man knows his stuff!
He knows how to purify water, treat wounds, turn a bucket into a
sanitary latrine, and trust me when I say SO MUCH more!

I LOVE this world, I really, seriously do! HOWEVER, if there's ONE
THING this book has made me aware of is that I'm entirely TOO LAZY for
Armageddon! JUST reading the preparations in this book exhausts me!
GEESH! FORGET IT! When I hear the apocalypse approaching I'm going to
take my favorite candy bar blender drink (a little EXTRA vodka!) out
to the curb, put 4 cigarettes in my mouth and wait for the approaching
wall of fire to light them for me! Frankly I'm not afraid of dying,
but I'm also not interested in living in a world with no libraries and
bookstores and strawberry ice cream. Fuck it.

On the other hand, suppose a decent number of libraries survive. The world, post Apocalypse, could be an austere paradise. I love survivalist lit. But I'm not the healthiest kid on the block.

Here is an excellent article on the work of Paris's Christophe Bruno:
http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/textualized

This is the first thing i've read about Christophe's work. It's really
exciting that it is such a good article. It isn't boring. Which is
exceptional concerning writing about digital literature or perhaps anything.

Christophe does truly intelligent, innovative, sparkling work. Finally an
article that is up to his work.

Congrats to Lori Emerson for being the editor and especially Søren Pold for
being the author of the article.

David,

This opens up the question of "foreignness" and "service," "loyalty" and
"betrayal" in a brilliant way, and, also, it reconnects language, it seems
to me, to its central place in the culture. Poetic styles or the jobs the
poets take or the techniques they use to generate language ("how to proceed
in poetry") -dreams or computer processes or "forgeries" or "translations"-
are not innocent acts. They are integral acts related to the place of
language -its "producer" and "consumer- in the culture.

Newspapers refer to The White House as the "consumer" of intelligence. As
fascism grows, the state becomes a producer of transparent fiction -full of
"act/security." For instance, aren't Shakespeare's early history plays -with
the possible exception of Julius Caesar- creations myths of the Elizabethan
State? On the other hand, Hamlet, and Macbeth, are about regicides, two
sides of the coin. Hamlet is the poet, meandering, incoherent/opaque, cruel
in relation to others, obsessively involved in process as a means towards
conscience and clarity. Are the soliloquies confessions or moments of
absolute solitude?  The acts the poet Hamlet is capable of is process
towards conscience/consciousness -a producer of play within the play, in its
subversion an ethical mouse-trap. On the other hand, Macbeth is pure act, as
Lady Macbeth urges, a slayer of conscience, therefore, also a slayer of
sleep, melancholy (full of eyes), ever watchful of oneself and others,
condemned to be a warden of a panopticon, the king of its petty routine.
Fascism is a state without a conscience.

Ssweet!

Lori Emerson's electropoetics gathering includes:

Introduction: ceci n'est pas un texte
Lori Emerson introduces a gathering of nineteen electro-poetic essays.
This gathering brings together both critics and creators of electronic
poetry; as is usually the case in ebr, the 'electronic' does not
exclude, but helps us to reconfigure and revalue poetic works in print
as well as define what works in digital environments.


Biopoetics; or, a Pilot Plan for a Concrete Poetry
Eugene Thacker resituates the work of Eduardo Kac, not as art applied to
the life sciences, but as a form of bio-poetics, consistent with the
electro-poetics that has been a longtime focus of critical writing in
ebr. Rather than reduce the work to its material (in life-forms, or in
text, or in code), Thacker identifies ways that language, form, and
life intersect in works of bio-art.


Speed the Movie or Speed the Brand Name or Aren't You the Kind that
Tells: My Sentimental Journey through Future Shock and Present Static
Electricity. Version 19.84
Charles Bernstein. Keyword: speed. Speed as a morally coded concept.
Speed as success. An ethics of speed. Speed-reading. Virtual reading.
Cultural speed-up. Speed kills.


The Database, the Interface, and the Hypertext: A Reading of
Strickland's V
Reading Stephanie Strickland's V: Losing L'una/WaveSon.nets/Vniverse,
Jaishree Odin explores the implications of the paradigm shift from
modernity to postmodernity for our understanding of reading, writing
and living.


Robert Creeley's Radical Poetics
Marjorie Perloff reflects on the legacy of misreadings of Robert
Creeley's work and argues that his complex poetics should be read
transnationally.


An Inside and an Outside
In his review of two of Robert Creeley's last published books, Douglas
Manson urges us to read these late poems as sending ideas outward,
toward an "outside," so that we begin gathering in tomes, searching for
quotes.


Perloff on Pedagogical Process: Reading as Learning
Douglas Barbour reads Marjorie Perloff's Differentials: Poetry, Poetics,
Pedagogy as a notable addition to her oeuvre, another grab-bag of
pertinent, impertinent, and always provocative readings of both a wide
range of works and some of the social/cultural contexts in which we
read them.


Literature from Page to Interface: The Treatments of Text in Christophe
Bruno's Iterature
S=F8ren Pold explores the ways in which Christophe Bruno's Iterature
expands the notion of literary form and shows what happens when words
are no longer only part of a language.


How to Think (with) Thinkertoys: Electronic Literature Collection,
Volume 1
Adalaide Morris considers 'tutor texts' in the Electronic Literature
Collection and, in doing so, articulates a poetics for the emerging
field of e-lit. Instead of fulfilling Ted Nelson's dream of 'computer
lib,' the most compelling entries in the Collection emphasize the
continuing necessity of writing under constraint. When the revolution
turns out to be, not a liberation from a culture of control but its
transformation, practices long familiar to experimental poets in print
become generalized throughout new media and their panoply of
'thinkertoys.'


Letters That Matter: The Electronic Literature Collection Volume 1
John Zuern considers the significance of the first volume of ELO's
Electronic Literature Collection for the future of electronic arts.


Electronic Literature circa WWW (and Before)
Chris Funkhouser reads the Electronic Literature Collection Vol. 1 as a
crucial document, an effective reflection of literary expression and
areas of textual exploration in digital form.


Eshleman's Caves: a review of JUNIPER FUSE
For Jay Murphy, Clayton Eshleman in his JUNIPER FUSE makes a resounding
case for lived experience, for the tortuous growth, however partial or
fragmented, as rooted in self-suffering as modes of vision and dream.


The Linguistic Cartography of Toilets and Ginger Ale
For Angela Szczepaniak, Canadian poet Stephen Cain visually distorts
language by blurring the borders of poetic language and national
identity, which are often assumed to be much more clear and distinct
than they actually are.


Three from The Gig: New Work By/About Maggie O'Sullivan, Allan Fisher,
and Tom Raworth
Three recent poetry publications by Nate Dorward's press The Gig are
reviewed by Greg Betts; these are not poems so much as environments
outside of, perhaps astride, the contingencies of systems.


Soft Links of Innovative Narrative in North America
The collection of innovative writing Biting the Error: Writers Explore
Narrative is, for Janet Neigh, also a refreshing example of innovation
of the anthology genre itself.

Seeing the novel in the 21st Century
Mike Barrett evaluates Steve Tomasula's The Book of Portraiture in terms
of its place between tradition and artistic innovation in the 21st
century.

The Comedy of Scholarship
Katherine Weiss revisits Hugh Kenner's playful work of scholarship
Flaubert, Joyce, and Beckett: The Stoic Comedians, a book which offers
a glance into the more experimental scholarship of 1960s France and
provides an analysis that to this day seems original.

The Death of a Beautiful Woman: Christopher Nolan's Idea of Form
In a reading of Nolan's films (with and against texts by Poe,
Wittgenstein, Searle, and Derrida), Walter Benn Michaels examines the
autonomy of the work of art.


The Gesture of Explanation Without Intelligibility: Ronald Schleifer's
Analogical Thinking
Stephen Hawkins reviews Ronald Schleifer's Analogical Thinking, arguing
that despite Schleifer's attempts at interdisciplinarity, his book
falls short of a truly collaborative approach.

Saving the Past: Deleuze's Proust and Signs
Stephen Hawkins engages with the "web of counterintuitive, paradoxical,
contentious and yet important claims" that he identifies in Gilles
Deleuze's Proust and Signs.


Reading the Conflicting Reviews: The Naysayers Gerald Graff overlooked
in Clueless in Academe
Genevi=E8ve Brassard defends Gerald Graff's original approaches in
Clueless in Academe against his critics - for the problem with Graff's
book does not lie between the covers but rather between the ears of
those who fault him excessively for sins of omission and commission.

Glad to hear from Ann B. on the casual encounters with violence to
which we grow accustomed. (Men, too?) My twenties were all about
figuring out where I could get good and drunk without worrying about
being raped or abandoned. I remember many first dates with nice boys.

And I remember the Iranian women I've known since '79. I'd argue that
the Iranians at least have a dialogue on liberation and freedom and
violence because of that Peacock regime, which permitted images of
Western female liberation (--as if!) (kidding!) and encouraged
European education for the wealthy women too. The Saudis haven't had
an option like that, nothing like it. Last I heard, from a friend in
the luxe hotel biz, was they wanted to demolish a rounded skyscraper
because it might make the women horny. At least once my friend's
tampons were confiscated for similar reasons. (Also any clothes from
Marks & Spencer were destroyed or the label cut out because it's a
Jewish company.) About 9 years ago, I was doing an article on a Swiss
spa and spent an evening chatting with a Saudi couple. They were in
their thirties, very well dressed--she certainly wore no veil. At
some point, though it had nothing to do with the article (which never
ran anyway), I had to ask about clitoridectomies. The woman didn't
know the word, but her husband did, and he explained it to her. Then
let her do the talking. She told me she was horrified by the idea,
that no one in Saudi would allow such a thing, that primitive people--
maybe in Africa--might do it, but it was impossible for her to
imagine. (Apparently denial is a river in Saudi Arabia, too.)

Finally, I'm glad that David C. mentioned Black Friday, our great
American shopping day, in his post on violence against women. I've
been talking about Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping all
week, as his movie, What Would Jesus Buy?, is slowly unrolling around
the country. (I highly recommend it.) He doesn't talk about violence
per se, though it is a theme throughout, and one that interests me.
He does show shoppers mowing one another down to get to sales. He
does show the violence of small towns shut down by Walmarts and other
big box stores that destroy local business. He does show the violence
abroad of child labor and foreign wages. Does he need to spell it
out? Probably so. I recently found a statement by Sue MacGregor, PhD,
that "Persons living in a consumer society live a comfortable life at
the expense of impoverished labourers and fragile ecosystems in other
countries." (http://64.233.169.104/
searchq=cache:fwIZD2QT3AkJ:www.kon.org/hswp/archive/consumerism.pdf
+consumerism+violence&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=safari) Her
essay,  "Consumerism as a Source of Structural Violence," posits that
contemporary consumerist capitalism is a source of much of our
culture's violence. She also mentions one of her own earlier essays
-- Macgregor (2001) -- which calls consumerism a slavery for those
who consume. I certainly know women who have been pained about the
amount of shopping they can't stop doing. Not to mention the violence
of a woman's anorexia or bulimia -- a real violence against her own
loathed, not-good-enough-for-a-beer-ad body. Against my own loathed
body. For years. As if there weren't better things to do. Which is of
course exactly why this post is post-able on this list.

I don't know about any studies of this.  But, I think, more Latin American writers have been involved in this kind of work during the twentieth century than poets from anywhere else, the most prominent, after Paz, being obviously Pablo Neruda.  His Autobiography tells stories about his service in several places.  Regards, Tom Savage

Diane DiPrima <ddiprima@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  The Elizabethan world was full of poets in the foreign service. Christopher
Marlowe, Walter Raleigh, to name just two obvious ones.

And of course Spenser wrote the Faerie Queene as propaganda more or less on
the order of Queen Elizabeth to glorify her dream of world domination. So he
as many others worked in public relations. Elizabeth changed her mind about
taking on Spain after Drake took the Armada. Spenser was far from completing
his poem and more or less committed to it. He spent the rest of his life in
virtual exile on an estate in Ireland that Elizabeth ³rewarded?him with.

Subject: Re: poetry and the foreign service

I did a quick search for something along the lines of what Barry asked
about, and just an Oxford UP book by Vincent Sherry called The Great War
and the Language of Modernism (2003) seems tangentially to address the
issue. What an interesting question, though, about modernist poets in
the foreign service (I'm interested in the history of what poets have
tended to do for money). And these aren't modernists, but perhaps
they're part of the geneology nonetheless: Chaucer, who was some kind
of foreign minister for both Richard II and Henry IV, and Thomas Wyatt,
who likewise did foreign errands for Henry VIII. =20

Two notes.

1. If we call every conflict or source of conflict violence the term
quickly loses its usefulness.

2. "Not to mention the violence of a woman's anorexia or bulimia -- a
real violence against her own loathed, not-good-enough-for-a-beer-ad body."
Anorexia is a complex, barely-understood perceptual disorder. I
worked with several anorexics professionally and was married to a
woman who had been hospitalized as an adolescent when she weighed 60
pounds (her normal body weight was 100) and constantly struggled to
behave counter to reality as she experienced it. That reality was
that when she looked in the mirror she saw obesity. She was one of
the lucky ones. There is no treatment that helps more than a minority
of sufferers. Those who survive sometimes do so like my ex-wife; some
others appear to grow out of it in their late 20s. Whatever the
impact of consumer culture on their self-perception, they experience
themselves as fat even when they have "good-enough-for-a-beer-ad" bodies.
Bulimia seems to be a different condition, involving fear of becoming
fat. Anorexics are convinced that they are fat.

NEO-BENSHI LIVE FILM NARRATION
8:00 pm     $15/$12/$8

"Neo-benshi at its best mashes up subversive written
scripts, deft acting, and acrobatic mind-eye
coordination."
  -- Steve Dickison, The Poetry Center, SFSU

Poets from Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York
offer a fresh take on the Japanese tradition of
"benshi"-a writer or actor who provides live narration
and commentary alongside silent films. The neo-benshi
concept invites writers/performers to choose scenes
from well-known narrative features or TV shows, mute
the soundtrack, and re-inscribe the familiar images
with new meanings.

Featuring scenes from:

Rebel Without a Cause (1955)
Kiss Me Deadly (1955)
Poison (Alfred Hitchcock Presents, 1958)
Vive L'Amour (Ai qing wan sui, 1994)
Uzumaki (2000)
Minority Report (2002)
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)
Satyricon (1969)


re-interpreted live from the stage by 8 solo benshi:

Nada Gordon, Roxi Power Hamilton, Jen Hofer,
Douglas Kearney, Eileen Myles, Jennifer Nellis,
Konrad Steiner and Stephanie Young

David,
I will very briefly try to sum up the backchannel i sent to Alison Croggon

late last night, thanking her for links: I wrote to Alison, in more words than the ones I'm
about to write to a list: my post to list was my emotional reaction to
two very angry Iranian women I saw on t.v. who were seeking help from feminist organizations in
the U.S.to help their friends, family, fellow humans in Iran. (See? these Iranian women live
in the U.S. now and they've been trying and trying and trying...with NO RESPONSE that's
what THEY said.)
I was merely reporting something.
They were absolutely furious with American feminists. That's all I ever really said. They just
can't get over it. And, by the way, I've met with so much resistance on this subject, it's hard
for me to believe. I thought I was just saying something. Sort of like "awareness"--not political
debate or authoritative rant. I never claimed to be an authority.
I do not pretend to be an expert. And I barely have time to write poetry let alone write on lists
(no, I didn't write that part to Alison...but I thought it just now)
I will also sum up what I wrote to someone else on the list yesterday or, rather, what he wrote
to me but i agree with him so much, i'm taking his advice to the point that i'm quoting him
(but i do not intend to write his name because i don't feel it is my right to involve him in
this: but what he said was: it's so difficult to have these discussions via email.
and in another email i sent yesterday i wrote: why do i waste my time writing on lists?
But: also: thank you to Nicholas Karavatos for the article you sent. I really appreciate it.
You live there (I'm writing to Nicholas Karavatos now). Because you live there I take you as being
an authority on this subject. You live in the midst of it. So I'm
planning to shut up on this subject.
Sorry my links were not whatever--it's true--i was just sending links. not to provide authoritative
texts just to let people know about t.v. show in Saudi Arabia. i didn't have time or inclination
to check out sources--i just thought people might be interested in t.v. show which really
shocked me. i figured: if they were interested enough, they'd do their own research on the subject
(that's what i do when i want to know about something--and it was enough for me to know that
t.v. show existed in the first place. i didn't think i had to back it up so carefully--just to know
it exists etc.)

thanks for your response,
bobbi

Subject: Re: a response for bobbie  (checking sources)

Dear Bobbie:

i was talking last night on the phone with my mother about the need to be c=
ontinually checking on the provenance of sources which one finds--in any me=
dia--
the literature on this need is growing continually--as there is a huge amou=
nt of "information" available which has to be traced back to its sources in=
 order to have an idea how accurate it is,  it even true at all--as well as=
 all the "grey areas" of distortion, selectivity, dis/mistranslations, edit=
s, omissions, "echo chamber effects" and the like--

i was happy to find alison croggin's post regarding this today as it is an =
example of how  research into the background of "signs taken for wonders" a=
s Karl Marx called such things, may often be found to be  "too good to be t=
rue"--

i went and looked up the sites you listed here, and they all turn out to be=
 of a dubious nature in one way or another--

the original source turns out to be MEMRI TV--

if you check for example the wikipedia entry on MEMRI--this is an organizat=
ion which has been widely criticized and questioned by persons in many coun=
tries--as to the integrity of their information in all facets of media--

as in any period of war, one needs to be aware of how much propaganda, fear=
 and hate mongering, distortions, lies, becomes the norm--

there are billions beyond billions of dollars, not to mention euros and yua=
n and yen--at stake in these conflicts--in order to ensure that the support=
 of populations is there for the huge corporations and interests, industrie=
s which profit from the war machines, it is necessary that as many persons =
as possible believe the most damning lies about other populations whether i=
t is in terms of religion,ideology, ethnicity, culture or that all embracin=
g term "way of life"--"the clash of civilizations"--"barbarism and civiliza=
tion"--such fundamentalist views are required to make persons blind deaf an=
d dumb in regarding the being of other beings as anything but "the enemy," =
"the personification of evil"--

the idea is that one will no longer see the other as something worth more t=
han extermination--as much as possible--

so the images, sounds, texts one is shown are those which are designed to s=
how such others in the worst possible light--

which is the way that the actions of MEMRI are seen to be created and funct=
ioning by its critics--

in the film Blue Collar (with Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel, Yaphet Kotto am=
ong others)--there is a character who explains that power functions by sett=
ing people against each other--the rich against the poor, the Black against=
 the White, the old against the young--even the Union can be made to turn o=
n Union members--(the film was made before Reagan began to break the unions=
  with his firing of all the air controllers)-- become a tool of those agai=
nst unions--anything to destroy the idea of unity, solidarity--among person=
s in the face of power and profit--

WHAT: NONSEQUITUR & SUBTEXT READING SERIES PRESENT: Legendary Fluxus artist ALISON KNOWLESWHEN: Wednesday, December 5, 2007 at 8 PM WHERE: Chapel Performance Space at Good Shepherd Center, 4649 Sunnyside Ave. N (4th floor)Seattle (in Wallingford, west of I-5, just south of 50th St.)206-789-1939 and http://gschapel.blogspot.com Alison Knowles, a pioneering visual/book/sound artist and key participant in the legendary Fluxus group, presents an intermedia performance of her text "North Water Song," accompanied by her daughter Jessica Higgins (movement) and Joshua Selman (sound). Knowles makes her first appearance in Seattle on Wednesday, December 5 at 7:30 PM at the Chapel Performance Space at Good Shepherd Center in Wallingford; $5 - $15 sliding scale donation, at the door. This performance is presented by Nonsequitur (http://nseq.blogspot.com; 206-789-1939) and Subtext Reading Series (http://subtextreadingseries.blogspot.com) Born in New York in 1933, Knowles has been closely
associated with Fluxus, an international group of artists concerned with blurring the boundaries between the various artistic disciplines and everyday life. For her first appearance in Seattle, she will present "North Water Song," originally composed as a tribute to John Cage on his 75th birthday and realized as a sound work commissioned by West German Radio. A close friend and collaborator with Cage, Knowles uses chance operations to extract random fragments from a variety of texts, including her own writings as well as Thoreau's Journal, the I Ching, and other water-related publications. This performance will include three simultaneous realizations of the score, with spoken text by Alison Knowles, movement by her daughter Jessica Higgins, and sound by Joshua Selman. Nonsequitur is especially pleased to renew our association with Ms. Knowles, having previously released her only solo CD "Frijoles Canyon" on our What Next? Recordings label. ARTIST BIO: Alison Knowles makes per
formances, books, poems, and visual artworks. Since the 1960s she has been a key participant in Fluxus, along with Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Joseph Beuys, Dick Higgins, and many other international artists working in/across various disciplines. For Something Else Press she created "Notations," an anthology of graphic scores co-edited with John Cage, and "Coeurs Volants" with Marcel Duchamp. Other book-related projects have included the "Bean Rolls," a canned book that appeared in The American Century at the Whitney Museum (2000) and "The Big Book" (1967), a walk-in book with 8-foot pages; a second walk-in book, "The Book Of Bean" (1983) appeared in Venice. Her "House of Dust" was the first computerized poetry on record, winning her a Guggenheim fellowship. In the 1970s, she was Associate Professor of Art at the newly-born California Institute of the Arts with Alan Kaprow. Since the 1980s she has worked in Italy, Germany, and Japan making multiples, unique pieces, and sound wor
ks for radio. Her only commercial solo CD, "Frijoles Canyon," was released by Nonsequitur in 1992 on its What Next? label. In 2001, she performed and exhibited her new paper/sound works at the Drawing Center in New York. Her graphic scores were exhibited and performed recently at the Kitchen in NYC, and she will perform at the Guggenheim Museum in 2009. ================= More artist info: http://www.aknowles.com http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Knowles http://www.ubu.com/contemp/knowles/index.html Interviews: http://jacketmagazine.com/33/knowles-ivby-burnett.shtml http://fluxusblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/interview-with-alison-knowles-by-ruud.html http://musicmavericks.publicradio.org/features/ =================OTHER EVENTS OF NOTEBook Launch Reading for ANOTHER KIND OF NATION: AN ANTHOLOGY OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE POETRY (Talisman House, 2007), at ELLIOTT BAY BOOK COMPANY, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2007 at 4 pm (free)Crawlspace Book Launch Reading & CD Release Party A Poem by Dan

Steve, yes, I know what you mean.  The FANTASY of this is kind of
terrific.  When I was a kid there was a weird Charlton Heston film I
was obsessed with called OMEGA MAN, set in stark post Armageddon Los
Angeles.  One of the things I liked to do was stare into the
background of the outdoor shots to see cars on the distant freeways
that you weren't supposed to notice.

In reality the libraries will look much like Baghdad's libraries, ash.

I wish the poetry collection at Buffalo had some sort of nuclear war
provisions.  Michael Basinski should request funds for this in his
budget.  We'll all crawl our way to Buffalo.

Here's a question though, and I'm serious:  Would you still write
poems if you were the LAST person on Earth?  The absolute LAST person.
 Not even any hope of offspring or anyone.

Because I know I would!

To me, to ask What Would Be The Point in such a case is like asking
WHAT IS THE POINT for writing them now.

NOT that I don't want people to read my poems!  I guess I'm just
saying I think I would still want to write them.

But maybe not.  Maybe I'd be so miserable I wouldn't want to do anything.

Being the only person on Earth sounds awful.  But at the moment with
this ridiculous "holiday" shopping season scurrying around me at top
speed it sounds kind of fucking nice!

"Document is a small booklet stapled to a bonzai-sized document

about opening & reading. & about travel (& migration). ... There's
something in the atmosphere. In the elegant brutality of several
phrases among these twelve poems, of which two by the way pose as
epilogues. In the suspicion that nothing is impossible or even very
difficult if she sets her mind to it. ...I will jump aboard the coat &
leave you, hopefully, curious at the quay." -Lars Palm in "Galatea

One of the more truly strange and fascinating tales in the annals of
spydom, polylinguistics, newspaper and book addictions, friend of the
rich and famous, scientists, writers and social lights,  is the
professional baseball player Moe Berg,  of whom two adult bios and one
juvenile readers' accounts have been penned.  (ESPN also made a good
video bio.)


Since he was a lifetime catcher, (after an early in career injury,
soley used as a backup, often third string; weak hitter, very good
defense), Berg may be thought of as one part of Jack Spicer's battery
of pitcher and catcher.

As a member of a team of mainly All Star players sent to Japan in 1934
(he'd also gone in '33), Berg, while the team played in another city,
took a tour of Tokyo during which he ascended to the top of building
and took movie camera footage of the harbor and important buildings of
the capital city.  These later proved to be his entree into the early
days of the OSS, culminating in a mission to attend a war time lecture
by Heisenberg in Switzerland and bring back a report of it, to see if
any evidence of any work on a Nazi A-bomb.

Berg was a bizarre character who grew progressively stranger and more
deliberately "mysterious" in later life, letting it be thought that he
was still an agent, while actually having been let go after the OSS
began to turn into the CIA.

Due to his obsessive reading of newspapers--which he would not not let
anyone else touch until he had read them, as until then they were
"alive"--and his wide reading in obscure topics, Berg became famous in
the mid 1930's as a guest on "Information Please" Quiz Shows on the
radio.  The weird combination of a baseball player with the knowledge
of a "professor" made him a huge favorite.  To the end of his life he
was able to live off of friends and in their homes due to his early
celebrity and "connections" across many strati of society.

Berg always let it be known that he studied and mastered many
languages--though it is unclear how much he really knew or could
speak.  He was able to create a myth about himself which gave him a
freedom from a life of much work (many years of his career he played
in very games), and at the same a dependence on others, opening and
closing many strange doors during his life.

The reason for writing of him in connection with poets and foreign
service is that Berg was able to exist in seemingly disparate worlds
by the continual manipulation of his self-created image of a man who
was very good with words--the vast vocabulary of the memorizer of
mountains of information, from the most trivial, obscure and dull   to
the most significant, useful, and interesting.  Adding to this his
self-created aura of a quick-study learner of a great number of
languages 'dead' and living, Berg was able to wow others impressed by
words, from sports writers and PR radio people to professional
lecturers, "experts," and his bosses in the OSS.  These in turn
promoted him--basically Berg became a man who lived by his wits via
the creation of a persona who existed only in language.  His
biographers note that as the years went by, the chasm between his
outward persona, with its vast vocabularies,  and his inner
"emptiness" as an actual person, grew ever wider.  The illusions he
performed became ever harder to sustain, and the limits of his actual
world smaller and smaller.

Via the ambiguities of his actual knowledge of languages and
vocabularies, roots and grammars,  long before he became a
professional spy, Berg had created such a niche for himself.  When he
skipped a ball game to take candestine films, he was in a sense
"projecting himself" via these images into his future role as a
surveillance-being, a hired listener and reader, a hired "catcher" of
(stolen) signs from the "pitcher" of the opposing team.

A graduate of Princeton, the third string catcher and radio star, the
ambiguous newspaper addict and obscure book collector Mr Berg became
involved in the A-bomb saga begun by one of Princeton's
most famed future Professors, Albert Einstein.

And at the heart of all these events is the activity of words employed
in both a "foreign service" and in the service of the creation of a
persona who existed sporadically in the "Objectivist" poetry of
baseball  box sores and much more "under cover" and shadowily,
rhizomatically, among the "Curveballs" of languages, words, signs, and
in   the "stolen signs" and "moving pictures"  creating
interconnections between  baseball diamonds and the fissioning of
atomic  particles linking the USA and Japan.

(Working to see if the Germans had the makings of a Bomb, Berg all
along carried within him the cinematic and linguistic seeds of the
Bomb's ultimate destinations in Hiroshima, Nagasaki.)

In a strange way indeed, Moe Berg is actually a "deep cover" player in
the baseball/Hiroshima poetry connections found within Jack Spicer's
work, and made fully explicit by that would-be author of an "After
Spicer" work, Araki Yasasuda, in the poem "Horsehide and Sunspot, 17
July 1968--Hiroshima Municipal Stadium."

From the baseball diamond of Princeton where Einstein later teaches,
via a clandestine film made while playing hookey from a ball game, to
the Candlestick Park of the pitchers and catchers of Spicer's radio
broadcast games, to the fictional poet attending a game in Hiroshima
Stadium, one finds the famously flat-footed radio star, spy and
catcher, language-obsessed, walking through the 20th century's atomic
Holocaust of fissioning, fusioning, fall out  particles of atoms and
poetry, box scores, coded messages, screaming headlines, obscure and
trivial '"faits divers" and a landscape of writing in which the
"writing on the wall" is the physically embedded shadow of the last
living instant of a human being.

From a moving picture image to a shadow fixed in concrete by the light
flash of a never before seen sun . .  .

Baseball games seen by the eyes of a participant/ bench warming
player, heard on the radio by a poet of Outside, observed by a
fictional poet created by a pseudonymous "late" writer . . .

a trajectory of reading and writing moves through identities real,
imagined, covert, pseudonymous, dead, ghostly, Outside . . . writers
and readers that are themselves  fissions, fusions, recorded images
and voices, receivers and transmitters of the ghostly, the Outside,
the dead, the living-dead, the imagined, the hallucinated, the
Shocked, the voluntarily or not covert . . . among forgeries and
doublespeak--propaganda and prayers--

a trajectory of energy, mass and light speeding towo/ards a shadow
embedded in concrete--

not a "writing ON the wall"--but a writing IN the wall--

a concrete shadow in three dimensions of a light eclipsing the sun in
broad daylight--

(in its --or "under cover" of its--darkness are all the words ever
written so intermingled they have become --unreadable--or are they now
being transmitted in an other way from this cipher of/at the edge, the
"last instant"--what sounds come forth from the depths within the
wall--or have they all become at once "concrete" and "shadow"- . . . )

(Both the bios for adults of Moe Berg are very good, the other i have
yet to read.  Moe Berg is also the only person one may find having
bios at such sites as Famous Jewish-Americans, the CIA website and
many baseball sites and some other espionage ones.

Cathers often later in life become radio announcers and managers.  The
only one who is a kind of relative of Moe Beg is Bob Uecker, the Hall
of Fame broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers, also a star of the
Johnny Carson Show and the tv sit com Mr. Belvedere.  Like Berg,
Uecker was a famously mediocre hitter--he had a "perfect" . 200
average--the only itcher he could hit was, inexplicably, Sandy
Koufax-- --and also very good defesively.  He, unlike Berg, was able
to use his gift with words as a stand up comedian and a writer--his
Carcher in the Wry is a fun read.

What a wonderful account - and interp - of this Moe Berg, David! In/of who I have
been ignorant. I like the ghost play analysis - tho I will have to revisit the connections you make with Jack Spycer (haha!). Tho Spicer was clearly aware the trajectory of the shadow on the Hiroshima wall.
 The line between poetry and spying & code-breaking is also there among the Brits in World War II. M-5 (is it?) British Intelligence made use of the 'new criticism' skills of students of IA Richards and William Empson.  7 Types of Ambiguity  - as a  manual for decoding poems was also good training for decoding enemy scripts. The fact that some of these students - Marxist communists - were also into re communicating secrets to Moscow  put another set of ghosts into the works. Apparently the information on how to build the bomb traveled quite easily from Washington to Moscow. Beware the well trained boys from both Princeton and Cambridge. The poem as a double agent!  I won't go further with that.

via a clandestine film made while playing hookey from a ball game, to
the Candlestick Park of the pitchers and catchers of Spicer's radio
broadcast games, to the fictional poet attending a game in Hiroshima
Stadium, one finds the famously flat-footed radio star, spy and
catcher, language-obsessed, walking through the 20th century's atomic
Holocaust of fissioning, fusioning, fall out  particles of atoms and
poetry, box scores, coded messages, screaming headlines, obscure and
trivial '"faits divers" and a landscape of writing in which the
"writing on the wall" is the physically embedded shadow of the last
living instant of a human being.

From a moving picture image to a shadow fixed in concrete by the light
flash of a never before seen sun . .  .

Baseball games seen by the eyes of a participant/ bench warming
player, heard on the radio by a poet of Outside, observed by a
fictional poet created by a pseudonymous "late" writer . . .

a trajectory of reading and writing moves through identities real,
imagined, covert, pseudonymous, dead, ghostly, Outside . . . writers
and readers that are themselves  fissions, fusions, recorded images
and voices, receivers and transmitters of the ghostly, the Outside,
the dead, the living-dead, the imagined, the hallucinated, the
Shocked, the voluntarily or not covert . . . among forgeries and
doublespeak--propaganda and prayers--

a trajectory of energy, mass and light speeding towo/ards a shadow
embedded in concrete--

not a "writing ON the wall"--but a writing IN the wall--

a concrete shadow in three dimensions of a light eclipsing the sun in
broad daylight--

(in its --or "under cover" of its--darkness are all the words ever
written so intermingled they have become --unreadable--or are they now
being transmitted in an other way from this cipher of/at the edge, the
"last instant"--what sounds come forth from the depths within the
wall--or have they all become at once "concrete" and "shadow"- . . . )

(Both the bios for adults of Moe Berg are very good, the other i have
yet to read.  Moe Berg is also the only person one may find having
bios at such sites as Famous Jewish-Americans, the CIA website and
many baseball sites and some other espionage ones.

Cathers often later in life become radio announcers and managers.  The
only one who is a kind of relative of Moe Beg is Bob Uecker, the Hall
of Fame broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers, also a star of the
Johnny Carson Show and the tv sit com Mr. Belvedere.  Like Berg,
Uecker was a famously mediocre hitter--he had a "perfect" . 200
average--the only itcher he could hit was, inexplicably, Sandy
Koufax-- --and also very good defesively.  He, unlike Berg, was able
to use his gift with words as a stand up comedian and a writer--his
Carcher in the Wry is a fun read.

In January, 2007 someone invited me so I wrote a poem and sent it to Dan
Waber a couple of weeks later for his ars poetica website because I liked
the idea behind the site.   Some time after that I was curious as to why it
had not appeared. Dan politely wrote back that he was getting so many
submissions that my poem would come out in approximately nine months!

Here is the link for the site (which no doubt most of you have seen, but
even if you have, it is certainly worth visiting again):

Landis Everson, 1926 - 2007
Member of Berkeley Renaissance group later returned to poetry after four decades

By Mary Rourke, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
November 29, 2007
Landis Everson, a member of the Berkeley Renaissance poets of the 1940s and
'50s who later gave up poetry for four decades but made a strong comeback in
his old age, has died. He was 81.

Everson died Nov. 17 in Mill Valley, north of San Francisco, of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to Denise Wilson of the
Marin County coroner's office. His body was found on a public path and taken to
Marin General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

He had been in failing health in recent years after suffering several strokes.

Everson came of age as a poet with his friends Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser and
Robert Duncan, the core members of the Berkeley Renaissance poets.

They aimed to write "erudite poetry -- classical and biblical allusions were
the norm," wrote Rachel Aviv in an essay about Everson and his colleagues that
is posted on the Poetry Foundation website.

In "Lemon Tree," Everson refers to "a tree that grew in the Garden of Eden" and
suggests that the fruit turned bitter after Adam and Eve were cast out of the
garden. In other poems he used Surrealist images -- of deer grazing in his bed,
for example.

"Landis had a very contemporary-style surrealism," said poet Kevin Clark,
chairman of the creative writing program at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. "He
connected the imagery to our lives, more accessibly than many Surrealists do."

When the Berkeley Renaissance poets drifted apart in the early 1960s, Everson
gave up poetry. He stopped because "for him poetry is a communication between
friends, not a commercial enterprise," according to a 2005 New York Times
article about Everson. "I wasn't seeing my friends," Everson said to explain
his decision.

He settled in San Luis Obispo and worked in construction, renovating houses. He
returned to poetry in his 70s, after he retired.

He was encouraged by poet and editor Ben Mazer, who discovered Everson's work
while he was researching the Berkeley Renaissance poets several years ago.

After meeting Mazer, Everson wrote some 300 poems in three years.

In 2005, he received the Emily Dickinson Award, given by the Poetry Foundation
to poets over age 50 who have never published a book. The following year
Everson's first book, "Everything Preserved: Poems 1955-2005," was published by
Graywolf Press.

"Landis never thought of publishing a book as an end result," said John Barr,
president of the Poetry Foundation. "He wrote poetry to share with his
immediate circle of friends and was far less interested in writing to publish."

Everson was born in Coronado, Calif., on Oct. 5, 1926. He graduated from UC
Berkeley in the early 1950s and went on to earn a master's degree in English
from Columbia University in New York.

After returning to poetry in 2003, he often traveled to give readings of his
work. He was in Boston for a reading last year when he suffered his first
stroke.

"Landis was a gentle, sweet guy," said Kevin Patrick Sullivan, co-director of
the annual San Luis Obispo Poetry Festival, where Everson was featured in 2006.
"He was a little astounded by the fuss over his work after all these years."

Everson has no known survivors.

unrelatedly, he died in the hospital where I was born.

more relatedly, doesn't the line "for him poetry is a communication
between friends, not a commercial enterprise" describe the stance of
most of the Berkeley poets of that group? from what I've read, Spicer
held this position...

sad news indeed.=20

What a wonderful account - and interp - of this Moe Berg, David! In/of
 who I have
been ignorant. I like the ghost play analysis - tho I will have to
 revisit the connections you make with Jack Spycer (haha!). Tho Spicer was
 clearly aware the trajectory of the shadow on the Hiroshima wall.
 The line between poetry and spying & code-breaking is also there among
 the Brits in World War II. M-5 (is it?) British Intelligence made use
 of the 'new criticism' skills of students of IA Richards and William
 Empson.  7 Types of Ambiguity  - as a  manual for decoding poems was also
 good training for decoding enemy scripts. The fact that some of these
 students - Marxist communists - were also into re communicating secrets
 to Moscow  put another set of ghosts into the works. Apparently the
 information on how to build the bomb traveled quite easily from
 Washington to Moscow. Beware the well trained boys from both Princeton and
 Cambridge. The poem as a double agent!  I won't go further with that.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote: One of the more truly
 strange and fascinating tales in the annals of
spydom, polylinguistics, newspaper and book addictions, friend of the
rich and famous, scientists, writers and social lights,  is the
professional baseball player Moe Berg,  of whom two adult bios and one
juvenile readers' accounts have been penned.  (ESPN also made a good
video bio.)


Since he was a lifetime catcher, (after an early in career injury,
soley used as a backup, often third string; weak hitter, very good
defense), Berg may be thought of as one part of Jack Spicer's battery
of pitcher and catcher.

As a member of a team of mainly All Star players sent to Japan in 1934
(he'd also gone in '33), Berg, while the team played in another city,
took a tour of Tokyo during which he ascended to the top of building
and took movie camera footage of the harbor and important buildings of
the capital city.  These later proved to be his entree into the early
days of the OSS, culminating in a mission to attend a war time lecture
by Heisenberg in Switzerland and bring back a report of it, to see if
any evidence of any work on a Nazi A-bomb.

Berg was a bizarre character who grew progressively stranger and more
deliberately "mysterious" in later life, letting it be thought that he
was still an agent, while actually having been let go after the OSS
began to turn into the CIA.

Due to his obsessive reading of newspapers--which he would not not let
anyone else touch until he had read them, as until then they were
"alive"--and his wide reading in obscure topics, Berg became famous in
the mid 1930's as a guest on "Information Please" Quiz Shows on the
radio.  The weird combination of a baseball player with the knowledge
of a "professor" made him a huge favorite.  To the end of his life he
was able to live off of friends and in their homes due to his early
celebrity and "connections" across many strati of society.

Berg always let it be known that he studied and mastered many
languages--though it is unclear how much he really knew or could
speak.  He was able to create a myth about himself which gave him a
freedom from a life of much work (many years of his career he played
in very games), and at the same a dependence on others, opening and
closing many strange doors during his life.

The reason for writing of him in connection with poets and foreign
service is that Berg was able to exist in seemingly disparate worlds
by the continual manipulation of his self-created image of a man who
was very good with words--the vast vocabulary of the memorizer of
mountains of information, from the most trivial, obscure and dull   to
the most significant, useful, and interesting.  Adding to this his
self-created aura of a quick-study learner of a great number of
languages 'dead' and living, Berg was able to wow others impressed by
words, from sports writers and PR radio people to professional
lecturers, "experts," and his bosses in the OSS.  These in turn
promoted him--basically Berg became a man who lived by his wits via
the creation of a persona who existed only in language.  His
biographers note that as the years went by, the chasm between his
outward persona, with its vast vocabularies,  and his inner
"emptiness" as an actual person, grew ever wider.  The illusions he
performed became ever harder to sustain, and the limits of his actual
world smaller and smaller.

Via the ambiguities of his actual knowledge of languages and
vocabularies, roots and grammars,  long before he became a
professional spy, Berg had created such a niche for himself.  When he
skipped a ball game to take candestine films, he was in a sense
"projecting himself" via these images into his future role as a
surveillance-being, a hired listener and reader, a hired "catcher" of
(stolen) signs from the "pitcher" of the opposing team.

A graduate of Princeton, the third string catcher and radio star, the
ambiguous newspaper addict and obscure book collector Mr Berg became
involved in the A-bomb saga begun by one of Princeton's
most famed future Professors, Albert Einstein.

And at the heart of all these events is the activity of words employed
in both a "foreign service" and in the service of the creation of a
persona who existed sporadically in the "Objectivist" poetry of
baseball  box sores and much more "under cover" and shadowily,
rhizomatically, among the "Curveballs" of languages, words, signs, and
in   the "stolen signs" and "moving pictures"  creating
interconnections between  baseball diamonds and the fissioning of
atomic  particles linking the USA and Japan.

(Working to see if the Germans had the makings of a Bomb, Berg all
along carried within him the cinematic and linguistic seeds of the
Bomb's ultimate destinations in Hiroshima, Nagasaki.)

In a strange way indeed, Moe Berg is actually a "deep cover" player in
the baseball/Hiroshima poetry connections found within Jack Spicer's
work, and made fully explicit by that would-be author of an "After
Spicer" work, Araki Yasasuda, in the poem "Horsehide and Sunspot, 17
July 1968--Hiroshima Municipal Stadium."

From the baseball diamond of Princeton where Einstein later teaches,
via a clandestine film made while playing hookey from a ball game, to
the Candlestick Park of the pitchers and catchers of Spicer's radio
broadcast games, to the fictional poet attending a game in Hiroshima
Stadium, one finds the famously flat-footed radio star, spy and
catcher, language-obsessed, walking through the 20th century's atomic
Holocaust of fissioning, fusioning, fall out  particles of atoms and
poetry, box scores, coded messages, screaming headlines, obscure and
trivial '"faits divers" and a landscape of writing in which the
"writing on the wall" is the physically embedded shadow of the last
living instant of a human being.

From a moving picture image to a shadow fixed in concrete by the light
flash of a never before seen sun . .  .

Baseball games seen by the eyes of a participant/ bench warming
player, heard on the radio by a poet of Outside, observed by a
fictional poet created by a pseudonymous "late" writer . . .

a trajectory of reading and writing moves through identities real,
imagined, covert, pseudonymous, dead, ghostly, Outside . . . writers
and readers that are themselves  fissions, fusions, recorded images
and voices, receivers and transmitters of the ghostly, the Outside,
the dead, the living-dead, the imagined, the hallucinated, the
Shocked, the voluntarily or not covert . . . among forgeries and
doublespeak--propaganda and prayers--

a trajectory of energy, mass and light speeding towo/ards a shadow
embedded in concrete--

not a "writing ON the wall"--but a writing IN the wall--

a concrete shadow in three dimensions of a light eclipsing the sun in
broad daylight--

(in its --or "under cover" of its--darkness are all the words ever
written so intermingled they have become --unreadable--or are they now
being transmitted in an other way from this cipher of/at the edge, the
"last instant"--what sounds come forth from the depths within the
wall--or have they all become at once "concrete" and "shadow"- . . . )

(Both the bios for adults of Moe Berg are very good, the other i have
yet to read.  Moe Berg is also the only person one may find having
bios at such sites as Famous Jewish-Americans, the CIA website and
many baseball sites and some other espionage ones.

Cathers often later in life become radio announcers and managers.  The
only one who is a kind of relative of Moe Beg is Bob Uecker, the Hall
of Fame broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers, also a star of the
Johnny Carson Show and the tv sit com Mr. Belvedere.  Like Berg,
Uecker was a famously mediocre hitter--he had a "perfect" . 200
average--the only itcher he could hit was, inexplicably, Sandy
Koufax-- --and also very good defesively.  He, unlike Berg, was able
to use his gift with words as a stand up comedian and a writer--his
Carcher in the Wry is a fun read.

I had not noticed any mention of Landis Eversons' death tho I think I received word of it late last Sunday so I am saying something. At first, his first book made me hopeful about his (new) publisher (only of books, not the journal) and their intent as well as expected quality for future collections. And he wrote some remarkable poems, ones that moved me at moments.

  I first learned of Everson in Fulcrum #2 where I appeared with him. While I was not impressed with the poems (from the 50's), the fact of Ben Mazer "finding him" before so many others who were, in my estimation, way too far in depth, immersed in the Berkeley Ren., ringtones and all, including friends and former students, THAT PART was impressive, the finding. What was more pronounced was the new material that subsequently followed, an amazing piece appeared in the The Sycamore Review (1 of 2), an awe inspiring chunk in APR, and there was another set in a location that leaves me at this moment. By the time the book came out I was actually excited, which says a lot for someone who is enamored of Blasers essays (see the recent UC collection), sceptical about Spicer (Collected), and only interested in small sections of Duncan (Bow, mainly).

  What a great poet Landis was, there was poem that in my memory,  which all of this is from, I think from SR, called Potatoes and Onions, correct me if I be wrong. The repetition was perfect, not too much Stein.  Just the perfect mix of Spicer's playfulness with Duncan's loft and Gilbert's "down to earthiness" to relegate this writing to the most important figures of the round table.

  When his first book surfaced I remembered that I had read him once in the stacks in some library I was invited to, in Ashbery's Locus Solus (sp?), a journal that was often fancy and flight driven in a way that was distasteful. The pub seemed like it was so locally driven that the gist of the moment, or "history," was absent in so many areas, so purposely removed. I hope I am being clear, and the notion of what I call "new-frenchism," totally derived from attempted translations (best example Tennis Court Oath from JA or Freely Espousing from Schuyler, both of which put them on the map in many ways but have not stood any sense of time from what I have learned from earlier Generations (tho Jimmy immediately escaped it)) a plateau which can be annoying in general, for being the primary tone of each collection.  Landis had an interesting "Romaness" to his stance, tactfully appealing but empty on the inscape, an angle of approach that abutted and refuted the new modernist
 approach of the period.

  Anyway, to be brutal, from the "closest" to LE I know, I was told that Landis shot himself once in the head with a world war 2 service revolver. There is little else that has come to light, probably since he was an isolated person from what I know of the last five years, let alone earlier when he entirely disappeared. If somebody wishes to share their appreciation of his work, or knows more please tell, feel free to frontchannel, backchannel or give me a call. If not, buy the book, try it out, let me know--

Murat has written often to this list with his thoughts re images,
photographic and otherwise, and in many of his notes he discusses the
peripheral areas of a photo, an image, as creating a more democratic
field --for thought, investigation, vision--than that of the framed
and directed "center of attention."

This is among the themes beautifully presented in Murat's book The
Peripheral Space of Photography  which is at once a philosophical work
and a poem, embodying a poetic structure which reveals itself,
emerges, "exposes itself," in the reading, rather than being in itself
an imposed  "center of attention."

(Paul Celan:  "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."
Celan's statement is one too sadly ignored for the most part still.
Imposed poetry is pretty much "the order of the day.")

The riots of the last few days and nights in Paris are a manifestation
literally of the peripheries in revolt against the "center of
attention" of the capital city, where the attention is always directed
and framed by sites/sights/cites of order and consumption, of control
and carefully structured and managed gazes.   The peripheries,
neglected and consigned to a form of living oblivion, are the dumping
grounds of the city's peripheral populations--the working class, the
poor, the emigrants and children of immigrants.

For now a Wall of police, helicoptors, fire brigades, is thrown up to
keep these peripheries at bay.  One can imagine that at some point,
the Walls may be literalized and solidified, made huge and concrete,
as they have been in other cities, gated communities, Green Zones,
borders,  and most extremely and repressively in the Occupied
Territories.


The "Wall of Seperation" becomes a way of "removing from the picture"
those peripheral elements of democracy of which Murat writes.

In these recently greatly enlarged fotos of Gettysburg on the day of
Lincoln's address, Lincoln is discovered, emerging from the crowds,
the masses of soldiers and citizens.  Yet at the same time, one is
very aware of how this figure of the "center of attention" moves among
gazes which, as they move towards the peripheries, have their
attentions directed elsewhere-inwardly, outwardly, to the sides,
up--that is, have a gaze which encompasses a much larger arena of the
"historical moment," and signal to the viewer the existence and
necessity of an awareness of the peripheral, even as one notes the
"center" moving among the "masses."

The "distraction/distractedness" of the peripheral gazes, rather than
"missing" the "central event," is creating a plurality of events and
gazes, desiring the response and attention not soley of the oblivious
center, but of that "something more" than a controlled and regimented
(literally, among the soliders) existence.

The "outside" of desire and vision--moving away from the controlled,
focused, directed, managed, policed and framed "center" of power and
consumption, which demands the all consuming attention --and
obediance--of everyone, no matter how little attention is given to any
but a few of them.

A poetry of the "exposed" image --and writing--rather than the imposed.

(Emerson:  the blank and ruin we see in Nature may be within our own eye.)

The final lines of the article charge the  "inherent bias of the
camera" with this construction of vision, though one might well
propose that it is the eye of the viewer which has been so
constructed, educated, trained, rather than the mechanical device
alone:

And this is somehow the inherent bias of the camera. It always directs
us toward the center of attention, never away to the periphery, even
though that is where our attention eventually wanders.

Here is the address for the article which has link to the fotos, which
truly are extraordinary.

Apparently, the poem is still at least an "operative". After
a poem of mine appeared in Claire Dinsmore's Cauldron
& Net (Vol. 3), I had one inquiry from an agency asset
and one from an apparent British op, who wanted to know
more and more. Seems as though my piece was percieved
by both as a way to break the code of "Kryptos", the
puzzle/sculpture found somewhere on the grounds at Langely.
Typically also, they never seemed satisfied with my answers that
I intended no such reference, that the poem was simply a poem.

Someone recently told me that there are still sites which cite
my piece, which I find curious, since, for a time now, that
particular Vol of C&N (which also contained a great piece
by Lawrence Upton) is down.

Remembering fondly Basil Bunting as an op.

The Theatre of a Two-Headed Calf! A New Performance by Lucy Alibar! QURASH
CO-LAB!

Dyke Squad (a branch of The Theatre of a Two-headed Calf) is a queer
collaborative writing and performing team made up of Jess Barbagallo,
Laryssa Husiak, Brooke O'Harra and Laura Stinger, directed by Brooke O'Harr=
a
(with many amazing guest performers). Dyke Squad is pleased to present Room
for Cream, a live lesbian soap opera series which will run at La Mama, ever=
y
Sat. at 5:30pm beginning Jan 08. Dyke Squad came together in order to write
and perform queer theater and provide a solid venue to involve and engage
queer women in the community. . . . or perhaps to have some not-so-clean
dyke fun. The Theatre of a Two-Headed Calf, founded by Brooke O=B9Harra
(director) and Brendan Connelly (composer), is a collective of artists and
designers who are working in concert to explore new and often impossible
means of opening up and presenting dramatic texts. Their new production,
Drums of the Waves of Horikawa is at HERE Arts Center from October 24 -
November 17. Lucy Alibar's works include Juicy and Delicious, a bluegrass
musical about sex and Southern food (The Tank, Collective Unconscious); A
Friend of Dorothy, about Judy Garland (Best of Montreal Fringe nomination,
Avignon, Bath, and Edinburgh Festivals); Gorgeous Raptors, about girls who
transform into dinosaurs (Young Playwrights Festival, Cherry Lane Theatre).
This summer, Mommy Says I=B9m Pretty on the Insides and Home Baking Made Easy
(with Zoe Aja Moore) were performed at Williamstown Theatre Festival. Lucy
is an Affiliated Artist of New Georges, and a member of EST=B9s Youngblood.
QURASH CO-LAB (Queers United Resisting Assimilation into Societal
Heteronormativity) presents... T-Phag ProDuct #2 Chase My Hole, an 8 minute
collaborative 'ilm (like 'zine) that originated to give voice to working
class queer artists. The film itself is a double projection combining 16mm
and 8 mm film as well as a live musical score. In attendance will be John
Parker, a conceptual artist who created QURASH to build global-community
amongst queer artists. Parker also specializes in oil painting, woodcut
printmaking,and drawing. His work queers elements of concept, sound, form,
line, color and texture. He completed an BFA in Art at the University of
Texas. Parker also works in Super 8 film.

Steve D.

If you did catch a second of motorcylce accident
presentation in "I'm Not There" you have admirable
visual acuity.  However I think it was strange to go
see this movie with a checklist of things you expected
to see in the back of your mind.  It is very clearly a
wild fantasia created by one of USAmerica's most
remarkable film-makers, Todd Haynes, bouncing off the
life and times of Bobby Zimmerman.  I liked that it
was at times Fellini-esque or Godard-ian or imitating
the Pennebacker Dylan documentary I've never seen, and
Godard knows what else. (The scene in the diner in
which the "movie actor aspect of Dylan" first
converses with his French-born abstract artist wife
has dialogue adapted from a cafe scene in JLG's
"Masculine Feminine": "What would you say is the
center of your world?" "Well, I'm 22...I would say
myself").

As this is a poetics list, I should note that the
scenes involving Dylan and the young Allen Ginsberg
are a hoot. At one point they are looking at an
outdoor statue of the crucified Jesus and declaiming
witticisms.  Bob eventaully calls out "can't you do
any of your *old* material???"

There's so much more to say about this film.  Suffice
it for now to say that it is a daring
semi-biographical hybrid like Gus Van Sant's movie
about the last days of Kurt Cobain.  And the sound of
BD's post-motorcycle accident musical comeback *is*
represented in the moving presentation of "Going to
Acapulco" from the Basement Tapes in the final
enigmatic section concerning Dylan as an aging Billy
the Kid trying to protect the old weird American town
of Riddle.

I haven't seen the film and think it has numerous flaws - one being that it=
 was dreamed up and filmed, for one. Other than that it's a masterpiece of =
cinema.

 New on the blog

 Viz Lit, that is, digital camera in hand, the search to find visual analogs   (objective correlatives?) for whatever it may be: a literary form, a specific memory - a heightened moment in a romance - the visual complications in a metaphysical conceit, a particular image inside a specific poem, or, pushing it,  something found in a theory or practice... Why not some examples? ["Persimmons",  lost, early Robert Creeley Lyric, an Abbreviated Arkansas Black Apple Sonnet, Ezra Pound's nuts, &  a Sunday Morning Meeting of Poets at the Intersection 19th & Valencia].

 &

 Ghost Signage or The ATA House of Clifford Hengst


 &, if you are in the San Francisco Bay, I am reading tomorrow evening with Pat Reeed, Thursday, 7:30 at Pegasus Books on Shattuck Ave. in Berkeley, hosted by Clay Banes.

 As always, comments appreciated.

Conrad, the absolute last person... I was thinking I'd have poetry slaves. A small, highly literate group, devoted to ME. I'm a narcissist. & being a narcissist & a poet is torture. If I can't enjoy my narcissism, am I really a narcissist? But to answer your question, yes. I'd write poems. I'd even send them to non-existent journals. What the fuck. I'd stay drunk. I'd do every drug possible. Before long, I'd be so delusional it wouldn't matter if I were the only me. I'd have plenty of personalities to keep me company. Questions of the type you ask are enough to drive one to drink, but they should be asked. Fuck yeah, I'd still write. Maybe the utter hopelessness of the situation would bring out my best. I wonder if Samuel Beckett would have continued writing if he were the last living human? Of course, you're right about the libraries. & that, truly, is sad.

Steve, yes, I know what you mean. The FANTASY of this is kind of
terrific. When I was a kid there was a weird Charlton Heston film I
was obsessed with called OMEGA MAN, set in stark post Armageddon Los
Angeles. One of the things I liked to do was stare into the
background of the outdoor shots to see cars on the distant freeways
that you weren't supposed to notice.

In reality the libraries will look much like Baghdad's libraries, ash.

I wish the poetry collection at Buffalo had some sort of nuclear war
provisions. Michael Basinski should request funds for this in his
budget. We'll all crawl our way to Buffalo.

Here's a question though, and I'm serious: Would you still write
poems if you were the LAST person on Earth? The absolute LAST person.
Not even any hope of offspring or anyone.

Because I know I would!

To me, to ask What Would Be The Point in such a case is like asking
WHAT IS THE POINT for writing them now.

NOT that I don't want people to read my poems! I guess I'm just
saying I think I would still want to write them.

But maybe not. Maybe I'd be so miserable I wouldn't want to do anything.

Being the only person on Earth sounds awful. But at the moment with
this ridiculous "holiday" shopping season scurrying around me at top
speed it sounds kind of fucking nice!

--from "The Car, a Window, and World War II"

Ask yourself this question:
Does silence have to mean a lack of sound?
I hate the lack of sound myself, though crave the silence.
Yesterday, three people were shot at a check-point.
The difference between a moment of silence
and a decade of silence.
A lone piano plays into our daily commute.
Gravel, pretzel bits, a penny on the floor.
VACUUM: 50 Cents.
Sonic Youth behind another pane of glass, glazed.
They didn’t invent flesh as material, only the name:
“Adaptation Studies.”
The late light through the painted window
becomes part of the notes on the page.
Trace the tire marks, the fuel leak on the carpet,
call them “relics.”
She was emphatic: “I don’t read the quotes, I skip them.”
A statement which clearly gave her a lot of satisfaction.
This was years ago, hence the spaces, hence the space.

Conrad, If I were the last person alive, I'd read this:

            Wittgenstein's Mistress is a novel unlike anything David Markson--or anyone else--has ever written before. It is the story of a woman who is convinced--and, astonishingly, will ultimately convince the reader as well--that she is the only person left on earth. Presumably she is mad. And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state--obviously a metaphor for ultimate loneliness--so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time.
  "The novel I liked best this year," said the Washington Times upon the book's publication in 1988; "one dizzying, delightful, funny passage after another. . . . Wittgenstein's Mistress gives proof positive that the experimental novel can produce high, pure works of imagination."
    "Addresses formidable philosophic questions with tremendous wit . . . remarkable . . . a novel that can be parsed like a sentence; it is that well made."--New York Times Book Review
  "Unsettling, shimmering . . . compelling."--Publishers Weekly
  "A work of genius . . . an erudite, breathtakingly cerebral novel whose prose is crystal and whose voice rivets and whose conclusion defies you not to cry."--David Foster Wallace
  "Brilliant and often hilarious . . . Markson is one working novelist I can think of who can claim affinities with Joyce, Gaddis, and Lowry, no less than with Beckett."--San Francisco Review of Books
  "Provocative, learned, wacko, brilliant, and extravagantly comic. This is a nonesuch novel, a formidable work of art by a writer who kicks tradition out the window, then kicks the window out the window, letting a splendid new light into the room."--William Kennedy
  "In a just world, Wittgenstein's Mistress would be offered notice on the cover of the New York Review of Books. Let good readers therefore come and make up the difference."--Gordon Lish
  "I can't think of the last time I held my breath when I read a book, waiting for the author to make one slip. Markson is as precise and dazzling as Joyce. His wit and awesome power of observation make this fictional world utterly convincing. I couldn't put this book down. I can't forget it. While Markson himself would deplore the use of a cliche, all I can say is that this book is original, beautiful, and an absolute masterpiece. Anyone who reads it can't think about the world the same way."--Ann Beattie
  "Wittgenstein's Mistress is an original and haunting work. David Markson brilliantly demonstrates how art and memory can both heighten and leaven grief."--Hilma Wolitzer
  "Beautifully conceived. An irresistible, captivating book!"--Walter Abish
  "Beautifully realized. Initially as hypnotically calming as an afternoon snowfall, then, by stages as menacing and yet thrilling as a nocturnal blizzard. This is Markson in the post-Beckett Gaddis country, staking his own claim, in a territory nobody else has the courage or the strength to inhabit and survive in."--James McCourt

well yep

some of the editing is delicious and Blanchett steals the film hands down

If the chipmunk is that big, imagine the size of the nuts.

I'm a native Illinoisan, my dad was a conservation for the state of Illinois
in Knox County (about 90 mile WNW from Normal--really from normal) for
twenty years.  I don't remember seeing chipmunks that big, although there
were reports of giant sewer rats in Peoria, but a good divorce lawyer took
care of that vermin infestation.

I miss the wide-open sky of Illinois--you know the one with the roiling
black clouds (aka tornadoes, twisters, cyclones).  I used to be in a writing
group with folks from ISU.  I really do miss them.

Congrats on the book!

Christina

In Shanghai, you can buy pet chipmunks from street vendors (but they're not
that big).

guh, I am REALLY distressed that this is a FAKE chipmunk. I was
anticipating a Paleolithic-mammal discovery, much the same way that
scientists recently found, trufax, that Antarctica used to be occupied by
five-foot-tall penguins with spear-like beaks. You get a girl all wound
up, then you let her down? What kind of poethics is that?

gee, in search of a genuine chipmunk (hey, book title!)

A N   A S I D E : The Preservative Qualities of the Martini Diet

When Schlesinger turned 60, he became more aware of his age. After a trip t=
o the cathedral in Florence, he wrote:=20
=93As I went into the Duomo, it occurred to me that I have been visiting ch=
urches in Europe for 45 years, and that they have really done very little f=
or me - my fault, not theirs, of course; but there it is. Why should I wast=
e my declining years going into churches?... I will simplify life by abando=
ning the inspection of churches, as in earlier years I have abandoned balle=
t, metaphysics, linguistics and other subjects that, however estimable, are=
, alas, not for me.=94 A decade later, lunching with two younger men in 198=
7, Schlesinger observed, =93I could not help noting the generational differ=
ences in diet. I had a martini and grilled double lamb chops. They had Perr=
ier and chef's salad. I suppose that their diet is better for them. But min=
e is more fun. I understand the disappearance of cigarettes these days; the=
y are poison. But why has hard liquor, the staff of life, yielded to white =
wine and, heaven help us, Perrier?=94 In early 2007, Schlesinger died as he=

here is the poem I was talking of that I mentioned

  The Onion and the Piano
Landis Everson

It's not Dada to put together a piano with an onion, it's
easy to do, like painting any kind of landscape, or
speaking with a tongue split in two. On the window ledge
as you pass, a bowl with an onion in it is
a pale white inside a pale blue, and an etude
coming out, between curtains dotted red on yellow,
mixed with the smell of dinner, dancing and desire.

You make it up. You are playing a fife while
an enemy joins you on his piano. Behind you
there's a painting on the wall, "Girl With Onions." You once
loved her and associated everything with her smell.
You are drawing with chalk a rubble of onions thrown against a wall,
using every color you have to get the right white while
standing on a piano. Two pianos. You are standing in a field

of tomatoes and one onion sprout intrudes, dominating the view.
You hear the tinkling, too close to reality,
of an eighteenth-century harpsichord (not a piano?)
playing boogie-woogie thought up by Bach
in the shadowy intensity of the world between your ears.
Your coloring book growingly has no meaning--
you interchange the colors every day.
There's a ballerina on a giant onion, rolling

between laughter and her fancy feet. She is telling us
that there's a symbolic mystery under her movements
and the luminous ball she dances on, which has been
painted as an obvious fake of cardboard, confetti and paste,
with hints of layers of skin and the color of breaking waves,
that an onion, if it moves and is cold, could be an ocean.

Or almost anything (except by fact or fantasy) a piano.
Even the keys are an off-match, the legs impossible
the sound coming out of it never an onion sound,
not an etude for a tangy vegetable, unless you can allow,
as in a poem or cartoon, onions to possess voices singing
within the range of strings, pedals and soft hammers.

Merging into sight in the sky are two separated things,
a musician with his neck broken playing on an flattened onion
as if it were a violin, and under him the grass cups a blue ox
into a bowl with no meaning. You accept it, nodding your head
to the music. You are starved for improbabilities. There are
never enough in your life, between the ads

for cars high up on mesas and cures for erectile dysfunction,
fungus, bad breath and indigestion, any two will do.
It is like marriages that are needed. Some last, some don't.
There is surrealism in the air we breathe. Two
impossibilities, like rocks and branches, fit together
in the same landscape. They can kill you or help you live.

Thunder sobs next to the radio when it hears its big voice
reduced on a recording of a storm whose raindrops
share only stories of rain. However you look,
the piano and the onion are just lightning and hail,
mixing it up for equilibrium, equal shades of what's for real.

That's all intriguing to read -- but I wonder in what ways TENNIS COURT OATH
put Ashbery on the map -- Despite its good repute among some of us later
readers, it was greeted unpleasantly by most at the time and remains
remaindered in the eyes of most Bloomian critics --

I thought that one of the problems with the film was that, despite everything
Haynes and his apparatus said, the movie was very much just the sort of
checklist you invoke -- My vote for worst such moment being the "Just like a
woman" line -- No doubt that Blanchett steals the show, but I also found that
the second least effective part of the movie (the least effective, for me,
being the Gere section) -- At the beginning of the film, in the "Woody Guthrie"
section, I started to tell myself that this might actually turn out to be a
good movie after all -- but it didn't --

I know; I know . . . . But lots of people like Masked & Anonymous, too --

I still think EAT THE DOCUMENT one of the great underseen movies of its time --
and there's a great 2 1/2 hour movie hiding inside the otherwise execrable
RENALDO & CLARA --

Howdy Aldon--

  The Tennis Court Oath never did anything for me, but with us having a half generation between, it has been the generation before me, yours or nearly so, that has held it in such high regard. THEY SAID "you should read that." I never understood, so I'is just reporting my experience in terms of readership. By the time I read it in the late 80's it seemed doomed and done away with. Hence my high estimation of Jimmy S, even that which others have considered his "soft" work. But, in my late thirties, I would love hear others estimation on this-- be well --dave

See the city's ripped insides
Well see the bright and hollow sky
Well see the stars that shine so bright
The sky was made for us tonight

Oh the passenger
How how he rides
Oh the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?=20
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He see the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive

And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

Singin'...

Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his windows eye
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the city asleep at night
He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
Oh, lets ride and ride and ride and ride...
Singing...=20

The last 8 years have been an especially hectic and convulsive period
in our national experience, but you wouldn't know it from our movies,
which --only until recently--have devoted themselves, with increasing
energy and expense to fantasy, regression, nostalgia and wishful thinking.
Until this season's bumper-crop of topical films ("Redacted", "Lions for
Lambs", etc.)--it seemed as though because of censorship, political
caution and the pressure to produce mass entertainment for a heterogeneous
public(recal the Beverly Hills Summit a few years back, a powwow that
brought together almost four dozen of the Hollywood power elite with
President Bush's top advisor and strategist Karl "Goebbles" Rove... their
mission (which they seem to have accepted): to explore how the entertainment
industry can assist the Administration's war on terrorism.) (a half-dozen
spy-
oriented kid flicks, "300", "Hitman"), our movies have always been shy about
confronting our realities too directly. There are exceptions (as I mentioned
earlier),
but "I'm Not There" isn't one of them. Watching the biopic I was struck by
how different the path to fame was a few short decades ago compared with
today. After all, how could today's Dylan achieve celebrity status? "I'm Not
There" seems to be more there for B. D. than it is for us, although it does
show
some of the connections to the cult of celebrity and scandal (of the '60's),
and,
as usual will surely help to ressurect more interest in Dylan, whose work of
that
time may not have withstood the test of time, especially those narratives
full of
topical references and allusions. It's not easy stuff for the post MTV
generation,
as say, whatever is listened to now.

Having finally seen this film yesterday, I have to say that except for Cate Blanchett's wonderful performance, it is otherwise a pretentious and boring film.  I almost fell asleep at one point.  This is too bad because the only other Haynes film I've seen which was, if I remember correctly, called Far From Heaven, is a masterpiece.  In this one, he may have been trying too hard to produce a work of art.  What he arrived at is the worst sort of thing for any genre, pseudo-art.  Was Julianne Moore supposed to be Joan Baez?  I suppose you can't use the real names of living people in a fictional film without lawsuits.  Does that explain Allen Ginsberg's posthumous appearance in two of the film's most embarrassingly awful sequences?  Of course, the worst and most indigestible part of the movie is undoubtedly the Richard Gere sequences which make no sense at all either within the context of the rest of the movie or on their own terms.  It's sad that one of our greatest popular
 artists, Bob Dylan, has had such a mixed record of luck when it comes to films by and/or about him.  The first one was the best, as I recall.  The one in which he starred a few years ago was also a puzzling, somewhat pretentious mess.  Regards, Tom Savage

follow-up on subject of shorter poetry publications, what else is out there=
?

What i wanted to say about noon is that a lot of dedicated practitioners of
the form send their work there, as far as I can tell its one of the
preferred destinations at the moment for poems between 1 and 20 lines.
the question is, what other mags are around that work with short poetry?

i can think of Still from the UK, no longer publishing.
I havent seen Tundra or Hummingbird, but also havent seen announcements of
new issues for those mags recently.
=20
There=B9s Island, also from the UK, going strong, which features many one lin=
e
poems.


any others?
