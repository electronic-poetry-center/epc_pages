Rules for giving poems titles

1. If your poem is intended as a message, give it a title that reflects the
content. This is equivalent to writing on the subject-matter line of a memo
(hard or electronic).
2. If your poem is not intended as a message (i.e., if you are the kind of
person who, when wanting to send a message , sends a memo or a note or a
letter rather than a poem) give it a title for purely identificational
purposes. Don't use numbers but words because they are much more mnemonic.
That way you can say, for example, that they accepted, or rejected your
poem so and so, rather than saying that they accepted or rejected your poem
n, where n stands for any positive integer.

In other words, always title your poems. Your family and your friends will
greatly appreciate it and so will critics, scholars, and anthologists.

I agree with Kominos, Rebecca's post was a startling post for me to read,
very beautifully put ideas.  And the analogy with horror movies ain't bad --
it's an argument for the "absorptive" to some degree, in the sense that we
expect readers/viewers to ignore the frame of the experience (the movie, the
poem) but only so that the experience of the work be so complete that, once
escaping from it, the frames through which one views the world (the
eyeglasses, the 61st story window, the circle of friends who keep telling
you "you don't love girl," the newspaper) are permanently altered.  Would
that more poems were as absorptive as horror movies, or that the forms don't
nag you with their pretensions of "heightened language" and balanced
emotion, or maybe I just mean, too bad more poems don't seem to want to be
"of their time" in the way mainstream cultural products have to be.  This is
something of an inversion of Bernstein's idea regarding absorptive poetics,
and yet absorption, to some degree, has to occur somewhere -- I call this
the "entertainment value" of the piece (Smithson is turning in his
spiral-shaped grave right now); Brecht, for example, a key figure for CB's
essay, often wrote adopting these popular forms.  It is these vehicles that
may hold more "keys" to our understanding of today than the stripped down,
value-"neutral" forms of most poems.
> If we have learned anything as human beings these past few generations,
it's that differences make life interesting.
I, like Patrick Herron I've discovered (haven't checked out his site yet)
started my creative life in computer programming, and then immediately took
to Pound once starting poetry with the basic understanding that one poet
can, should the decision be made, adopt pretty much any form to write
provided the devotion to investigating the form is complete enough to follow
it to its grisly ends.  I thought that forms could be programmed -- indeed,
you mention the masks, a Poundian interest obviously -- and by extension one
could reprogram one's personality, which of course proves nearly impossible
but to pretend, for a day or so, that you have adopted a series of values is
something I do quite often (involuntarily, mostly).  (Gary Numan was a
recurring one.)  To follow a form to its "grisly end" could mean a
flirtation with values that, under daily, normal circumstances are repulsive
or unattractive (try being the Marquis de Sade for a day), but I think the
experiment a good one, and, yes, cyberpoetics could be the best field right
now for exploring these.  I have this idea of the interface creating, or
recreating, a user's perceptual frame for the moments of engagement, and
creating works that operate through several different interfaces (which is
what I tried to do in "Naif and the Bluebells") challenges the idea, I hope,
of the permanence of one's engagement with the computer, and by extension
with any engagement with "reality."  Well, my idea needs flesh.
> And what could be more fascinating than expressing it in a language of
transition and device.
Also unsettling, but with great erotic potential.
> Is the webpage, therefore, the mask of the cyberpoet?
And are all of Pound's personae merely web-pages (alternative interfaces)?
> The structure of the communication is certainly ritualistic.
If you have the stomach for dense, uncolorful texts, you should try checking
out Donald Davidson's writings on language, titles of which elude me right
now but there are only two (Actions and Events may be one of them).
> One must perform the ritual to gain the secrets that are gradually
revealed: clicking, clicking, clicking, moving in deeper and deeper as a
relationship develops between the cyberpoet and the viewer/reader.
Funny how many people don't see this as a pursuit of depth, but an avoidance
of depth.
This [Rebecca's post] is practically a manifesto...
When I was in Philly for the Philly Talks, some of the phone in questions
asked about computer poetry (in this case, programs that are used to create
poems that, in their "final life" are words on a page like any poet) where
the content of such writing is.  I rather inadequately answered that the
poems enact a series of interactions with the computer, and by extensions
certain types of systematic thinking, that provide something in the end of a
drama, if we understand drama to portray interactions primarily, through
humans. The first law (easily broken, of course) of dramatic writing is to
make sure the people on stage are arguing about something, not agreeing and
describing things in a similar fashion.  (The first law of the poetics list
seems to be that the argumentative threads live a little longer, and are I
think more interesting, but they get tired when we take them too seriously,
try to find "final" answers, as we would were Brian Denahey to take a swing
at someone who's beeper went off in the audience, as he nearly did on
Broadway.)  I figure these works (which often involved the uses of "lyrical"
texts, critical texts such as Bloom's Anxiety of Influence in one case,
weird translations of people like Nerval, etc., were creating a field in
which these figures argued [various figures like Brad Pitt and Gertrude
Stein would make appearances, too].  This was to assure that they weren't
leveled to a plain field of "democratic" mutual existence, the pop, the
discursive, the artistic living on equal levels in some sort of utopian
vision -- quite the contrary, the premises involve an understanding that, to
most of us, even the "advanced," these discourses have their places in
hierarchies, but hierarchies that are rather personal, not "eternal," and
whose sounding (like one sounds a jungle jim by hitting it with a pipe)
could provide pleasure.  In any case, the main argument in these poems would
be between the "natural hand of the poet" and the "system" that tends to
want to compartmentalize and de-organicize this sense of naturalness, of
wholeness (Anselm: I would say the Selected Poems de-organcized the
continuum of your father's achievement in this way, punching holes in the
sense of wholeness that was created by the day-to-day "project of the poet"
that was TB's particular mission).
The phone-in caller was not impressed.
> This, educative aspect of cyberpoetry brings to the forefront a question
of ethics. Do we really know what we are doing out there? Do we understand
the relationship between the screen, the eye, the mind and the heart?
This is interesting phrasing.  Art as "educative" in some ways is not a
generally held view, interesting that you find cyberpoetry being
particularly positioned to pose these questions.  I posted a long thing a
few weeks ago -- that was rejected, unfortunately, or didn't show up -- that
was a ramble to Jim Andrews about how all these web artists here in New York
are working by day for major corporations, making tons of money, and seemed
to have no problems having "two careers."  My sense was that this dual
careership actually hindered one's interest in web art as "educative," or as
a philosophical or investigative field, in which ideas could be followed to
their ends; the commercial relationship, I feel, will compromise this
aspect, since my experience in the corporate world is that any sharp edges
-- to one's personality, to one's speech, to one's ideas -- are always
having to be rounded off, or to stop just short of the idea of retreating
from the institution.  I don't think that one has to retreat from the
institution, but that one could possibly decide this and should be in a
position to do so.
> I hope it maintains a balanced representation.

Imbalanced misrepresentation has its virtues, too.

In the Jewish liturgy prayers are usually referred to by their first word
or phrase:  sh'ma yisrael; sim shalom; kol nidre; etc.  This feels very
comfortable and right to me and that's how I like to name things but I've
learned that many readers don't like it, they see it as repeating the first
line, so many of my poems end up with no titles.  Titles as a summing up
etc. make me uncomfortable for my own work, it doesn't quite fit.  But then
differentiating between pieces becomes difficult.  So I started using stuff
like smallcaps for the first word of a poem, but do people actually notice
such small gestures?

Note that new versions of Word will automatically name documents by their
first phrase until told otherwise.  Which of course becomes obnoxious ---
the program deciding for you.

This reminds me a little of the way Zukofsky's research for the Index
of American Design in the thirties was transmuted into material for
"A."  Also, another Rukeyser docupoem I like is "U.S. 1" (as in Rte. 1),

(I'm reminded by Stephen Vincent's "New York On Fire" post of:)

Paul Metcalf. Most of his stuff is "documentary poetry" -- although I, for
one, am not sure why he's usually put in the Poetry sections of bookstores
instead of "[Prose] Literature." Then again, I taught "Firebird" (from
Collected Works vol. 3) in the poetry segment of a course of mine once
(that's the "New York On Fire" connection). Also check out "Genoa," "Middle
Passage," and "Apalache" in vol. 1 and everything in vol. 2.

Can I just say for a moment? -- I love Paul Metcalf.

Also, perhaps, "documentary" is the very small and beautifully designed
"Wrackline" by Daniel Bouchard, available through Small Press Distribution
unless everyone else I've recommended it to have already bought a copy.

Jena, can you email (the list or me backchannel) what you end up using and
how it goes?

  I doubt whether that is how all  -- or even most --
readers of poetry do read.  But it would probably be
  the way that some professional critics might want to
      try to do their reading.  For what? to further their

"WHO GETS TO SPEAK AND WHY?, I wrote last week, IS THE ONLY QUESTION." -
Chris Kraus, _I Love Dick_ (Semiotext(e), 1997)

I love Chris Kraus. (Thanks, Jordan Davis, for turning me on to her book.)
I'm just about done with _I Love Dick_, and I wanted to suggest it, if Mark
P., Stephen E., Jacques D., Anselm B., Tom O., and others
involved/interested in the "power" discussion are interested, as being
fairly relevant. It's ostensibly a novel comprised of love letters, and it's
both, but it's also a way for Kraus to examine the very things you guys are
examining (and/or dismissing) here. The book is, I guess you'd say,
self-published, since Kraus edits the Native Agents series this book is part
of. (Which sort of matters in this instance.) I'll post here a section from
an interview with Kraus, and then a bit of the book ... it's kinda long ...

FROM THE INTERVIEW:

GI: When did the love letters change into a novel? You started writing, it
became more compulsive, and then it must have clicked into a book project.
You started to address an audience...

CK: Well, I realized that I had a problem. And my problem was, as an
artist, I had not been heard. And I didn't want to believe that the problem
was my fault. I thought it was cultural. You know, like Deleuze says, life
is  not personal. Because if success is culturally determined then so is
failure.  And it seemed to me that a lot of women who were working in a vein
similar to mine had also experienced this "failure." So what drove me on was
trying to figure out why there was no position in the culture for female
outsiders. You know, singular men are geniuses. Singular women are just
"quirky." Of course I really have Dick to thank for this, because he gave me
someone to write to.

GI: There's a literary fashion now for confessional literature. On the one
hand your book is confessional, on the other it's a book about the
intellectual context of America in the past 25 years. What's the difference?

CK: Well, I want to say there isn't any. And that's why this book is a
strategic confession. I'm very drawn to the use of the first person. When I
started the Native Agents series of books for Semiotext(e) seven years ago,
it was to publish the kind of writing that I liked -- and that writing was
entirely in the first person. And yet it was not an introspective,
psychoanalytic "I." It was an "I" that was totally alive, because it was
shifting. There's a tradition of American poetry that champions and
celebrates this -- New York School, the Poetry Project and all of its
successors. These people are true geniuses because they're living constantly
with ideas, they're fluent in a huge literary tradition. And yet they're
often denigrated by academe and the institutionalized avant-garde because
these ideas are experienced immediately and personally.

GI: So you think, like the '70s feminists thought, that the personal is
political?

CK: The personal pursued for its own sake is no good. The "I" is only useful
to the point that it gets outside itself, gets larger. In writing this, I
kept looking for other people's tracks that I was writing in. No one ever
does anything for the first time. I discovered that the New Zealand novelist
Katherine Mansfield had been there too -- SHE fell in love with Dick, and
wrote a story about it.

GI: Most of the successful art-world figures who you describe in I Love Dick
are pretty fucked up. The whole show is revealed as being pretty
dissatisfied....

CK: Yes!

GI: So you'd have to reconsider the whole notion of privilege then, wouldn't
you?

CK: Well, once you call yourself the biggest asshole, you give yourself a
lot of freedom.

GI: So you put yourself in the abject position?

CK: Life had put me in the abject position, so I thought I might as well
take advantage of it.

GI: So it's a kind of freedom.

CK: If no one cares what you have to say, then you can say anything.

EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK

2. The Birthday Party

Inside out
Boy you turn me
Upside down and
Inside out....
 -- late 70s disco song

 Joseph Kosuth's 50th birthday party last January was reported the next day
on Page Six of the New York Post. And everything was just as perfect as they
said: about 100 guests, a number large enough to fill the room but small
enough for each of us to feel among the intimates, the chosen. Joseph and
Cornelia and their child had just arrived from Belgium; Marshall Blonsky,
one of Joseph's closest friends, and Joseph's staff had been planning it for
weeks.

 Sylvere and I drove down from Thurman. I dropped him off outside the loft,
parked the car and arrived at Joseph's door at the same moment as another
woman, also entering alone. Each of us gave our names to Joseph's doorman.
Each of us had names that weren't there. "Check Lotringer," I said.
"Sylvere." And sure enough, I was Sylvere Lotringer's "Plus One" and she was
someone else's. Riding up the elevator, checking makeup, collars, hair, she
whispered, "The last thing you want to feel before walking into one of these
things is that you're not invited," and we smiled and wished each other luck
and parted at the coat-check. But luck was something that I didn't feel much
need for because I had no expectations: this was Joseph's party, Joseph's
friends, people, (mostly men, except for female art dealers and us
Plus-Ones) from the early '80s art world, so I expected to be patronized and
ignored.

 Drinks were at one end of the loft; dinner at the other. David Byrne was
wandering across the room, as tall as a Moorish king in a magnificent fur
hat. I stood next to Kenneth Broomfield at the bar and said a tentative
hello; he hissed and turned away. A tighter grip around the scotch glass,
standing there in my dark green Japanese wool dress, high heels and make up
... But look! There's Marshall Blonsky! Marshall greets me at the bar and
says that seeing me reminds him of a party we attended some 11 years ago
when I was Marshall's date. And of course he would remember, because the
party was given by Xavier Fourcade to celebrate the publication of
Marshall's first book, On Signs, at Xavier's Sutton Place townhouse. It was
late winter, early spring, Aquarius or Pisces and I remember guests tripping
past the caterers and staff to walk around the green expanse of daffodils
and bunny lawn that separated us from the river. David Salle was there,
Umberto Eco was there, together with a stable-load of Fourcade's models and
a reviewer from the New York Times.

 At that time I was living in a tenement on Second Avenue and studying charm
as a possible escape. Could I be Marshall Blonsky's perfect date? I'd given
up trying to be as sexual as Liza Martin but I was small-boned, thin, with a
New Zealand accent trailing off to something that sounded vaguely
mid-Atlantic. Perhaps something could be done with this? By then I'd read
enough that no one guessed I'd never been to school. Marshall and I'd been
introduced by our mutual friend Louise Bourgeois. I loved her and he was
fascinated by her iron will and growing fame. "It is the ability to
sublimate that makes an artist," she told me once. And "the only hope for
you is marrying a critic or an academic. Otherwise you'll starve." And in
the interest of saving me from poverty, Louise had given me, for this
occasion, the perfect dress: a straight wool boucle pumpkin colored shift,
historically important, the dress she'd worn accompanying Robert
Rauschenberg to his opening on East 10th ... Most of Marshall's friends were
men -- critics, psychoanalysts, semioticians -- and he liked that he could
walk me round the room and I'd perform for them, listening, cracking jokes
in their own special languages, guiding the conversation back to Marshall's
book. So French New Wave. Being weightless and gamine, spitting prettily at
rules and institutions, a talking dog without the dreariness of a position
to defend.

 Dear Dick, It hurts me that you think I'm "insincere." Nick Zedd and I were
both interviewed once about our films for English television. Everyone in
New Zealand who saw the show told me how they liked Nick best 'cause he was
more sincere. Nick was just one thing, a straight clear line -- Whoregasm,
East Village gore 'n porn -- and I was several. And-and-and. And isn't
sincerity just a denial of complexity? You as Johnny Cash driving your
Thunderbird into the Heart of Light. What put me off experimental-film-world
feminism, besides all it's boring study groups on Jacques Lacan, was it's
sincere investigation into the dilemma of the Pretty Girl. As an Ugly Girl
it didn't matter much to me. And didn't Donna Haraway finally solve this by
saying all female lived experience is a bunch of riffs, completely fake, so
we should recognize ourselves as Cyborgs? But still the fact remains: You
moved out to the desert on your own to clear the junk out of you're life.
You are trying to find some way of living you believe in. I envy this.

 Jane Bowles described this problem of sincerity in a letter to her husband
Paul, the "better" writer:

"August 1947
 Dearest Bupple,
 ... The more I get into it, the more isolated I feel vis-a-vis the writers
who I consider to be of any serious mind. I am enclosing this article
entitled New Heroes by Simone de Beauvoir. Read the sides that are marked
pages 121 and 123. It is what I have been thinking at the bottom of my mind
all this time and God knows it is difficult to write the way I do and yet
think their way. This problem you will never have to face because you have
always been a truly isolated person so that whatever you write will be good
because it will be true which is not so in my case. You immediately receive
recognition because what you write is in true relation to yourself which is
always recognizable to the world outside. With me who knows? When you are
capable only of a serious approach to writing as I am it is almost more than
one can bear to be continually doubting one's sincerity...."

 Reading Jane Bowles' letters makes me angrier and sadder than anything to
do with you. Because she was just so brilliant and she was willing to take a
crack at it -- telling the truth about her difficult and contradictory life.
And because she got it right. Even though, like the artist Hannah Wilke, she
hardly found anybody to agree with her in her own lifetime. You're the
Cowboy, I'm the Kike. Steadfast and true, slippery and devious. We aren't
anything but our circumstances. Why is it men become essentialists,
especially in middle age?

 And at Joseph's party time stands still and we can do it all again.
Marshall walks me over to two men in suits, a Lacanian and a world banker
form the UN. We talk about Microsoft and Bill Gates and Timothy Leary's
brunches until a tall and immaculately gorgeous WASP woman joins us and the
conversation parts away from jokes about interest rates and transference to
make room for Her....

 (As I write this I feel very hopeless and afraid)

 Later Marshall made a birthday speech for Joseph that he'd been scribbling
on all night. And Glenn O'Brien, looking like Steve Allen at the piano,
performed a funny scat-singing recitative about Joseph's legendary
womanizing, wealth and art. Everyone clapping, laughing, camp but serious
and boozy like in the film The Girl Can't Help It, men in suits playing TV
beatniks but where's Jayne Mansfield as the fall girl? Then David Byrne and
John Cale played piano and guitar and people danced.

Sylvere got drunk and teased Diego, something about politics, and Diego got
mad and tossed his drink in Sylvere's face. And Warren Niesluchowski was
there, and John and Anya. Later Marshall marshaled a gang of little men, the
banker, the Lacanian and Sylvere, to the card room to drink scotch and talk
about the Holocaust. The four looked like the famous velvet painting of
card-playing dogs.

 And it got late and someone turned on some vintage disco, and all the
people young enough never to've heard these songs the first time round got
up and danced. Funky Town, Le Freak and Inside Out.... The songs that played
in topless clubs and bars in the late '70s while these men were getting
famous. While I and all my friends, the girls, were paying for our rent and
shows and exploring "issues of our sexuality" by shaking to them all night
long in topless bars.

I really enjoy the notion of Dahlen's ongoing _A Reading_
as a documentary project. I think it makes a tremendous
amount of sense: Documentary of time (bodily time,
calendar time), life (as both reader/writer). Documenting
one's reading life is very compelling.

stephen ellis's recent post "Up front and out of place" includes both
confidential  b/c correspondence of mine & part of a post I sent to the
subsubpoetics list which is quoted out of context.  his motivation was
obviously to embarass and hurt me personally.  fortunately, the lazy errors i
mentioned amounted simply to my not wanting originally  to take the trouble
distinguishing carefully between Bourdieu's terms--it didn't seem worth the
trouble & then I thought it did.  the content itself, i don't retract at all;
  i merely conveyed it more clearly, i thought,  in the second post.  which
is not to say that consistency is anything i care about.  the poetics list
has been a place where i liked to float new ideas & hunches.  i think i
profited sometimes from other people's disagreements w/ me.  but it seems
increasingly clear now that this is no longer--if it ever was-- a venue where
people can talk frankly w/ out censure or discuss substantive topics w/out at
the same time having to withstand personal insults of the kind that, for
example, mark presjnar lobs at me after each post i make, or the anonymous
phone calls i received after posting about the boston poetry conference.
indeed, any pretension the alt poetry community has (at least that part of it
represented by the list) about its ethical, cultural, or political
superiority has to be questioned very skeptically when frank discussion among
progressive *poets* in a public forum seems to be, w/ notable exceptions,
impossible.  why, after all,  do you think so many of the poets featured
prominently in @poetics have apparently left the list or only lurk now?

p.s. it will be very revealing (as this note probably won't be posted until
mon) to find out, in the meantime, *who* on the list thinks it's ethically
acceptable to read other people's mail & comment on it.

well i have to jump in here wrt bourdieu, whose work is useful to
discussions of poetry and poetics (as david kellogg has amply illustrated,
hi david!) yet whose work i have reservations concerning, at something
approaching a macro level... and the best way to get at same is to quote
here (sorry folks!) from (the late) bill readings's _the university in
ruins_ (harvard, 1996)... now we don't have to agree with readings of
course---i'm not offering this excerpt by way of "proof"---but i think he's
onto something by way of larger postsecondary issues... and i think
readings is suggesting here, in so many words, that there is in effect an
"outside" to bourdieu (whom he couples in this regard with john
guillory)---which is an ironic way of my saying that bourdieu's relatively
closed symbolic systems (as some here have correctly intuited) are
themselves part of the contested, and thereby highly theorized, site:

        "And when we speak of mapping, it is possible to understand why the
analyses of Pierre Bourdieu have been so attractive to many people in
Cultural Studies, since his practice of charting power relations along twin
axes of power (symbolic captial and socioeconomic capital) permits the
mapping of power relations in both the economic and cultural fields.  The
intersection of these axes produces a center, and positions of power are
callibrated in terms of closeness to this center. [readings footnotes this
and refers to bourdieu's chart in _homo academicus_]
        "The general notion of 'cultural capital' is one that seems more
and more attractive to North American scholars in the humanities.  Bourdieu
is one of the more frequently cited theoretical authorities in a certain
branch of Cultural Studies.  I shall discuss his analysis of the events of
1968 later on, but for now I want to ask why a thinker whose analytic mode
is conservative and normative (the mapping of social positions as
algorithms of deviation within a closed national cultural field) should
have been so attractive to those in Cultural Studies, who are normally
concerned to make radical claims....
        "Since Bourdieu has written a book on the University [i.e., _homo
academicus_] and since he is currently very popular as a theoretical
authority on culture, I want to take the time to trace the problems of his
analysis of the system of cultural capital.  This analysis is based on two
essential assumptions:  First, it it assumed that there is only one game:
in order for culture to be a relatively autonomous social totality (capable
of being mapped on the two axes), all cultural games are part of the great
game of cultural capital.  Second, there is no way out:  the borders of the
system are strictly drawn, and within them one can chart the distribution
of cultural capital in terms of ratios of differing prestige.  The single,
closed game is the game of national culture, whose boundaries are accepted
without question in order for analysis to proceed...." (105-6-7)

readings goes on quite a bit here to reach the following conclusion (111):

        "The appeal of Bourdieu to thinkers like Guillory and to those who
work more closely in Cultural Studies is that he offers an analysis of
culture that can take account of its loss of any specific reference -- its
dereferentialization -- while still being able to produce what looks like a
positive knowledge about culture, by mapping the distribution of cultural
capital in terms of proximity to or distance from a cultural center.  I
would argue that this is a misrecognition of the contemporary nature of
power.  Bourdieu and his followers fail to see that the center is not a
real place any longer.  As Foucault knew, panopticism is only one model of
power (though many of his readers tend not to notice this).  Culture is not
a citadel to be occupied.  In fact, no one sits in the center any longer.
The center was once occupied by the institution of the nation-state, which
embodied capital and expressed it as a culture that radiated across the
field of the social.  But the decline of the nation-state means that this
center is actually a lure.  Capital no longer flows outward from the
center, rather it circulates around the circumference, behind the backs of
those who keep their eyes firmly fixed on the center...."

all sortsa implications here for importing bourdieu into the early 21st
century north american? field of specifically *poetic* production (and
whether or not we accept his claims re the demise of the nation-state, its
replacement by transnational corporations etc.)... i think in any case it's
important to bring in some critique of bourdieu, at least insofar as he
DOES seem to be so popular in academic work, and hereabouts...

best,

Perhaps in the furture there will be a new science (or rather a continuation
of an old) called Web Archaeology, in which scientists and scholars will
peel back the layers of the net in an attempt to discover artifacts--poems,
discussion lists, photographs, etc.--from previous times and reconstruct
cultures from the past.

I'm sure this has been stumbled upon by others and fleshed out in minute
detail.  Are there any articles out there that address this concept?  Jesse

 From a personal perspective:

The titling of a poem is almost a whole 'nother poem, in terms of
importance.  I went back through a scad and a half of my own poems to try
and get an overview of my process, and I can't say there is much in the way
of consistency of method or intent.  Sometimes the title shines the light
on the poem, certainly, but not always.  Sometimes the title comes first,
the poem after.  Sometimes the "right" title never comes, and those are the
poems that I continue to see as unfinished.

I don't know that a title is supposed to do one specific thing.  It can
break a poem, that's for sure...and in some cases I believe it can make a
poem.  All I know for sure is that it needs to "fit", and that's hard to
qualify.  It can be the point, the counterpoint, the punchline, the
touchstone, the heading, the bass note, the rhythm, the melody.  It can be
the first line or last line of the poem itself (and so be not as completely
separated as a title might be thought to be), it can be no part of the poem
at all.  It can be a point or a misdirect, it can be a naming or a
misnaming.  It can set the stage or steal the stage.  It just needs to be
right for that particular poet's particular poem at that particular time,
the goal being for that feeling of rightness to travel from the writer,
with the poem, to the reader.

I guess about all you could say for certain about the title, is that it is
the first impression; but this is only mostly true even if I assume you are
referring to traditional typeset page-delineated poetry.

I find it amusing that "Untitled" is a title, one of the few one word
oxymorons.

There are many poems, of course, that do not have a title--not even
"Untitled", and are not diminished in any way by doing without.  Sometimes
the best title *is* none at all.   Would titling, then, be considered a
literary device like alliteration, or end-rhyme?  A tool to be used, or not
used as the writer sees fitting to the piece?  If so, then a taxonomy of
types might be valuable.  I checked The New Princeton Encyclopedia of
Poetry and Poetics and could find nothing covering the process/conventions
of titling.  Sounds like a paper just waiting to be written to me.

George -- thanks very much for such a generous reading of my post! Yes, it
all begins with Blake, with the mythos-shattering & forming of those great
works, open-ended, where the longing for unitive closure vies with and is
held in abeyance by the sense that totality wrecks ("foredooms" as you put
it) -- and it continues with Duncan, whose own project may not be so Orphic
as I first thought. If to call it "Orphic" we mean establishing the complete
identity between idea and thing, signifier and signified, then yes, Duncan
yearns for this, but also no, his project is too smart for this, he keeps on
leaping ahead, never allowing the poem to rest for long in one place,
knowing that positionality is best served up as a moveable feast.

And the pressure utopia (a very vexed term, as you warily note) exerts on us
from its "no-place" is great; it is the absence that is always questioning
our present position with respect to those legitimating constructs we have
assented to. How to think outside them? To think Outside at all is to think
Utopia, maybe.

Thanks for helping me to think through this a bit more -- and of course, so
very much more could be said.

i think what Tom has written below is the most eloquent and forceful
defense of Jacques' general approach, that one can make.

he clarifies many things (tho' i (and others i believe) were not unaware
of these ideas about the struggle for cultural capital...)

but if one looks closely, as sophisticated and rich as the ideas sound,
when put down in polished prose, they really lead almost nowhere...Nor are
they very interesting and helpful, either to readers or poets.  they
simply lead to the same impasse Jacques has reached:  people apparently
wanna "best" other people, one concludes, and get more fame and
acclamation than others do.  if there is a more interesting and productive
place this approach can lead, then i hope Jacques or Tom or someone can
develop it here on the list, in relation to contemporary
poetry.  otherwise, it just sounds like a sourly conservative take on what
poets do:  like everyone they want to triumph over others in some symbolic
way... It is in danger of becoming simply a vulger Reaganite poetics.

very little of what is actually going on, in the work of poetry, is
clarified by this;  at best it's a truism, blown out of proportion;

Bourdieu is now flavor of the month, in many intellectual and academic
settings;  (and i am impressed with what i know of his work);  but the
phrase "cultural capital" is one of those that threatens to
become so self-evidently "right", that it replaces thought...

best,

                     Hi, Anselm.
                       First, let
                     me try to say: the game, thinking
                  in diversity, our bewilderment detracts
              "down on yourself" the best
         shot as the words portend -- as split in
    All.  (I've been relatively
   quiet on this.)  WHAT THE
  NAME? The site
  is named
   'proximate'
      as a nod

                                    to the...
                               THE SELECTED
                            POEMS OF FEDERICO
                          GARCIA LORCA,
                         ed. Francisco Garcia
                        Lorca, and what is
                     at stake when I talk
                   about success in relation
                to experimental poetry. Obviously,
           I am not talking about Economic
    Donald M. Allen (various translators),
  PICTURE BRIDE, concept of proxemics in human

           communication,
             "proximate communications,"
                specifically
                   oral communications,
                          Kapital, even
                                    though this
                                           is in fact
                                                obtainable
                                                 by contained
                                                 extralinguistic
                                               information,
                                            e.g., body

                     language
                       & context.
                     That remote communications
                  such as recordings or textual communications
              do not have, cannot have,
         the hope of the very small minority
    of experimentalist poets in
   the form of grants, issues
  aside from
  several
   respectful
      conversations

                          of transcendent
                         medium) deserves
                        serious skepticism
                     when placed, in the
                   hundreds of thousands
                of dollars, or in the endive

Though I fear this will open a can of worms, or at best start a new thread,
I'll respond anyway.  I don't intend to sound flippant toward Gerald, but I
do have a very different point of view on the subject, which I'll share.

Speaking from my own work, I try not to write poems which _have_ one central
image (& as a reader, I generally find such poems boring, though as, I
think, a good reader of adequate education, I have learned to respect some
work of that sort).

To me a title is a starting point for the reader, & I do try to make it
that, though I'm not adverse to throwing (& again, as a reader, being
thrown) a curve ball.  A curve ball every once in a while keeps things
interesting.

I usually get the title after the poem is written, though not always.

& I've always liked poems without titles (which everyone else has always
told me is something that "shouldn't" be done).

What's that old quote, by one of the New York School poets, that titles can
be like little poems that lead into the big poem.  Was it Berrigan who said
that?  Maybe someone can provide that quote to the List & attribute it.

Though I often find Jacques' posts intelligent, I have to agree with much of
what Mark Prejsnar said.  If one really writes in order to accumulate
cultural capital, why then does one write-- anyone, that is, other than
[fill in the name of a poet you think has accumulated significant cultural
capital]?  Yes, I know a lot of people are concerned about a lot of the
issues Jacques raises, in terms of THEIR immediate reputations.  My question
then is: is that all there is? Apparently Jacques thinks so-- & this is
where the comparison to Bloom _is_ appropriate, in the sense of a reduction
of cultural activity to the most narrow & utilitarian terms.  Here, I also
disagree with Tom Orange's suggestion that the issue may be one of poets'
naivite.  It seems to me remarkably easy to claim that poets are naive in
this context, when naive is ultimately defined as not buying into Jacques'
particular take on literary politics.

All of which (as with all of the posts I'm responding to) ultimately eludes
the question of why write poetry.  Is it for food pellets-- or some type of
theoretical category that, as with Jacques' "cultural capital," can
ultimately be translated as the equivalent of food pellets.  Maybe, for some
of my "colleagues" on this list, that is the case.  But I feel sorry for you
if that's so.  For most poets though, including the so-called "fathers" (to
continue Prejsnar's use of Bloom's use of the oedipal model) & those who've
garnered Debrot's "cultural capital," I think there really is some other
reason.  Remember, even the major figures think that they're horribly
neglected-- as they are, in terms of the "mainstream" of society.  No, I
think that we write poetry because we love doing it.  & I think writing
poetry is perhaps the preeminent "nonproductive" activity (in the economic
terms from which Jacques borrows).  As such, I think it functions of a
critique of the values of capitalism, as well as of the utilitarian values--
socialist or not-- which Jacques seems to articulate.  All of which may not
entirely explain this strange activity in which all of us on this List have
some stake; however it is a more satisfying explanation (to me at least)
than some kind of wierd drive to be King of the Cultural Molehill.

The Basil Bunting Poetry Centre and St. Aidans College Durham present:
The Basil Bunting Centenary Lecture
by
Professor Peter Makin
Kansai University, Japan

"Silent, Accurate Lips": Meaning and Precision in Bunting's Work

A Public Lecture in the Lindisfarne Centre, St. Aidan's College, Durham
University, at 6.30pm on Wednesday March 1st, 2000. All are welcome.

Bunting described scholarly criticism as "painful... necessary
policework" - but made an exception for Peter Makin's thorough and lucid
work on Ezra Pound. Makin's writing on Bunting is certainly
amongst the best in the steadily growing field, and includes _Bunting: The
Shaping of his Verse_ (Clarendon Press 1992) and his recent edition of
Bunting's lectures _Basil Bunting on Poetry_ (Johns Hopkins 1999).

Details of further Bunting Centenary Celebrations can be found on the
Bunting Centre Website at:
http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dul0www1/index.html

Dear Friends:

 In NPR Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg said that if the Supreme Court

supports Congress, it is in effect the end of NEA (the National Endowment for

the Arts).

    This situation creates great concerns about Congressional funding

for creative arts in America, since NEA provides major support for NPR

(National Public Radio), PBS (Public Broadcasting System), and numerous other

creative and performing arts. If NEA is lost or weakened, our lives will be

similarly diminished.

    In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending costs and

streamline their services, some government officials believe that the funding

currently going to these programs is too large a portion of funding for

something which is seen as not worthwhile.

    Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person

per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year. A

January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish

to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement

as the most valuable programs for federal funding.

    Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have 13

subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.Each

subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is to have

each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is October 1.

    The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of support

for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by our making our voices

heard.



    Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends whom you

believe to be in favor of what this stands for. The full list will be

forwarded to the President of the United States, the Vice President, and the

Speaker of the House, whose office has in the past been the instigator of the

action to cut funding to these worthwhile programs.

    This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add your name

to it so that funding can be maintained for the NEA, NPR, and PBS.


    . Please keep the petition rolling. Do not reply to me.

    . Sign your name and locale to the list and forward it to others to sign.

    . If you prefer not to sign, please send the list to the email address

given below.

    This is being forwarded to numerous people at once to add their names to

the petition. It won't matter if many people receive the same list, as the

names are being managed. This is for anyone who thinks NPR and PBS deserve

$1.12/year of their taxes.

    If you sign, please forward the list to others. If not, please don't kill

it.


    ... If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc., signer of this

petition, please forward a copy to:  wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu. This way

we can keep track of the lists and organize them.


    Forward this to everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs

alive. Thank you.


.NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT the entirety of this letter and then

COPY it into a NEW outgoing message, rather than simply forwarding it. In

your new outgoing message, add your name to the bottom of the list, then send

it on. Or, if the option is available, do a SEND AGAIN.

David, okay, but

why tell me this to the side?  Why not put it up on the List?  Ethical
mistakes are common, and, I think, sometimes useful, especially with respect
to the formally "cozy" sense I get from the List that all its participants
are good boys and girls.  Whatever "offense" I "committed" remains in the
public domain, and can be commented on, as you've done.  While I respect
your opinion - or, rather the fact that you have one - I prefer not to
regard it as the form of "behaviorsim" that it does in fact seem, ie., with
the hope of "preventing" future offenses against the proprietary aspects of
The Private.  I should make clear the fact that Jacques' post was not
originally a back-channel, but was sent over a weekend during wch it would
not have appeared on the List, imn order that I might see it without that
attending time lag.  I saw later, in Jacques' post to Anselm, that he
(Jacques) had retracted from the List his post in response to me.
Nevertheless,

(despite whatever "ethical" propriety) the post in question was still
"material" that had, to me, especial interest by way of comparison to what
Jacques said in his post to Anselm.  Ie., there was between the two a change
and development of thought wch might usefully be considered.  So why ask
permission?  I mean, who "owns" thought, or its expression?  Are we to
presume that such are by their nature immediately under the likes of
copyright?  Since language is the determining aspect of the public domain,
it seems to me that anything said or written is equally so, despite it may
provide cause for offense on the part of those so quoted.  But so what?
That sort of offense can be generative as well as merely offensive.  In
fact, without some sense of offense, society (including the society of this
List) becomes increasingly stifled and uniform, a neo-conservative poetics
version of The Stepford Wives in wch reproduction for its own sake is the
be-all and end-all of Being.  Are we to presume that respect for one's
private authority take the place of that authority's expression in the
public domain of language?  And if we hope to ever expand that domain, how
can this be accomplished when the private authority that determines it is
permitted to overwhelm its possibilities by "owning" them without at the
same time being responsible to "what is said" outside of the fact of who
said it first?  That, I think, is where my presumption of what you take to
be "ethical" begins to take part in the continuation of a lie - asking
permission to use publicly what already is, by the fact of its expression,
in the public domain.  My own sense of ethics in this is, when you ask
permission, you get denial.  That's the set-up.  Like an over-inflation of
personhood - against wch I don't mind having acted a little seditiously.  As
the poet Karen Driscoll said,

I've learned a few things:

honey is a discharge

we're in a pile of shit

What's there to dread?  Dig up!
Otherwise, sleep with significance

i picked up a magazine yesterday that i'd seen around once or twice before
but not really paid any attention to, SPEAK ---- the motive this time was
seeing "The Museum of Jurassic Technology" written on the cover and thinking
"oh, that again, what the hell is that?" ----- then upon opening it i found
this semi lengthy article about one of those olson experience things that
they have yearly (?) in gloucester organized by ralph maud ---- and an
interview with pauline oliveros another with david byrne ---- harold jaffe
talking about subcultural narratives (amusing but not particularly profound)
---- interviews/profiles with/of ellen willis and e. k. sedgwick
(interesting) ---- still more to read, but as glossy magazines w/ cigarette
ads go this has been an ok read so far

the olson article has some funny stuff when the author sets about railing at
the poetic establishment, in particular APR and generally making nasty about
academics and academia --- altho he starts by saying that olson is mostly
known to people in the academy ---- still, maybe a magazine worth browsing
now and then...

Part of the joy of untitledness is the way an untitled poem sort of dips into
the space around it.

The page being part of the poem itself.

Or that somehow the act of reading a title breaks into the immediacy of a
poem.  If the poem is built to move in and out of the reader (or the air)
quickly, a title disturbs that.

Maybe it would be better like paintings, where you had a little card with the
title next to poem.

But titles are also a bridge between the reader and the writer, a place of
communion.

For me it has to do with process.  Even when I make things with titles, I
feel that I am somehow writing one long poem.  That all my writing (maybe all
writing  all language) is one poem and that titling somehow subverts this.

It is an interesting question.

Glad you weren't ble to delete my post!  I would love to be able to say I
*deliberately* had you looking in the wrong place.

But you also write:

"Sadly in broad spectrum treatments of

     art-as-social-phenomenon, the

 pleasures of reading for readers have

             to be disregarded."

Like you, I don't want to disregard my own subjective response to
literature--to do that would be hypocritical, no matter to what extent my
tastes are socially determined.    But it seems to me that the danger of a
corrective is *not* from the point of view of "the pleasures of reading."
That's the doxa.  But rather than emotive arguments appealling to
everyone's--including my own prejudices & self interest--can you *actually &
persuasively counter* Bourdieu's attempt to account for the social conditions
of art?

Variable:

-- sometimes a form e.g. Song ; Sonnet for Two ;
As 4 (a short piece with four "verses";

 sometimes a first word or phrase; ) sometimes the first word or phrase that
is not thereafter repeated -- the title is the beginning of the poem that
way;

sometimes a phrase of the kind that appears in the poem -- or should I say
that appears in The Rest of the Poem.

It's not easy to make thematic titles when you dont have themes.

Paintings are funny like that too, do you paint the title in the painting?
What is the status of a little card with the title on it on the wall, or a
number on the wall relating to a title in a catalogue? Is it part of the
"work" or not?

I'd like to hear a symphony orchestra stand up & say the title in unison
before they play the music.

How to substitute speech for the graphic effect of a title in a printed
poem?
How do people read titles?
  "This one is called..." followed by the title?
 or  just say the title & pause very significantly?

I agree - Beverly work represents a continuous document. Though she is
extraordinarily well read in a literary sense, I think it's more fair to say
that she's constantly "reading" everything (including literature). An
inveterate rider of buses - going to and from her teaching job (literacy for
adults) in San Francisco, her work can offer quite exacting detail of waiting
to transfer to the Filmore 22 bus at the corner of 16th and Valencia circa
1979, as well as "higher" reading of what reads its way back out of that
circumstance. (Then not a high comfort zone, I can assure one, "There but for
the text..."
Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Here's the latest from Segue @ Double Happiness

February 5
Michael Gottlieb / Liz Fodaski

Michael Gottlieb has two new books out: _Gorgeous Plunge_, published by
Roof Books and _More Than All_, a collaboration with Ted Greenwald,
published by Miles Champion in London. His is also author of _The River
Road_ and _New York_ among other books.

Elizabeth Fodaski is a former coordinator of this series, and the
editor/publisher of Torque. She is the author of _fracas_ (Krupskaya,
1999).


February 12
John Yau / Marcella Durand

John Yau's most recent books include _My Symptoms_ (1998), _Forbidden
Entries_ (1996), and _Berlin Diptychon_ (1995). He has work forthcoming in
the Denver Quarterly, American Poetry Review, The World, Seneca Review,
Tool, and Verse. A book of essays on art and poetry is forthcoming from the
University of Michigan Press. He teaches at the Maryland Institute, College
of Art (Baltimore), and lives in New York.

Marcella Durand is the author of _City of Ports_ and _Lapsus Linguae_
(Situations Press), the poetry editor for Erato Press in New Orleans, and
the program coordinator and web-site editor at the Poetry Project. She has
collaborated with artists Richard O'Russa and Karoline Schleh on
book-sculptures, broadsides, and prints.

This month & the next one are curated by LUNGFULL! Magazine Editor Brendan
Lorber.

Double Happiness is at 173 Mott Street, corner of Broome in Chinatown.

The readings are $4.  They start at 4:00pm.  It's all very simple.  Every
Saturday afternoon.  Drinks, I believe, are two-for-one, which is somewhat
more complex but no less pleasant.

If you'd like more information call 212.533.9317 or lungfull@interport.net.

Hope to see you there, after our eyes adjust to the darkness of the bar.

Hi there--just a quick note to say that I've recently set up a _very_
elementary website at <www.geocities.com/Paris/Cabaret/8975/>.  This has a
few promotional materials concerning the magazine I run, _The Gig_; a page
of N&Qs concerning contemporary (mostly UK) poetry (i.e. sources for lines
in various poems by Prynne, Bernstein, James, Forrest-Thomson, et
al--contributions to this welcome); and, most importantly, a JH Prynne
bibliography.

Some listmembers may recall that I ran that bibliography at a different
website; it has gotten rather out-of-date since then (most reference are
only up to 1997), but I plan to update it soon, so: (1) please reset any
links to my old homepage to the new homepage; (2) if you have info on
bibliographical material to add please contact me.  This would include e.g.
reviews of Reeve & Kerridge's book or the 1999 Bloodaxe volume. -- I'll be
making a full update of the bibliography later in the year, once I'm a
little less preoccupied.

all best --N

The charge of professionalization is thrown around a lot on this List.  But
what is meant by this is actually only a familiarity w/ the "professional"
discourses of critical & cultural theory.  Presumably the role of *poet*, for
some people, excludes this familiarity.  I would argue, instead, that after
the Language Poets, this familiarity is essential. Why? Because the whole
history of the series of changes in any aesthetic context is always *present*
in the latest examples of that context--just as, to borrow a metaphor, the
six numbers already dialed on a phone are present when the seventh is dialed.
 To the extent that such demands seem unreasonable, is to suffer from the
*illusion* that the *role* of poet remains constant simply because the word
*poet* does--as if there wasn't always a struggle for what that word *meant*.
 Ironically, Tony Green denies the existence of *competiton* while
simultaneously *competing* for his own version of the *legitimate* meaning of
"poet," & "poem"--neither of which are *givens*.

having not followed this thread closely --skimming 1st lines and deleting
though noting w/ pleasure the tenacity and engaged nature of the
participants --getting a sort of quick n dirty "energy read" on the thread
--this --apres l'affaire ellis/debrot --is the first time in quite a while
that i've read thru one of the posts, and am immediately struck by several
things.  1) now i'm as anti-essentialist and also as competitive as the
next gal, but it seems (and i've observed this before) that this is an
alpha-male set of assumptions.  i don't write to acquire cultural capital,
though it has come, through my professional activity, to be a nice
secondary benefit.  i write to keep sane, as i suspect many of us do.

2) as one of the subjects i love to investigate is "micro-poetries," where
the writer often doesn't publish --in the case of diaries, in fact, doesn't
even publicize the work in any way --this model does not obtain.  it is
easy to see how certain micropoetries --topical verse written for certain
occasions by family members etc --*does* function according to systems of
cultural capital (albeit w/in the circumscribed system of the family rather
than the literary world at large) --others, like lullabies, double-dutch
rhymes etc are much less obviously tied in to prestige systems.

so i assume that the realm you are addressing, guyzies, when you talk about
"writing" is the realm of the literary.  i'm deeply literary but where i
get my real intellectual pleasure is from exploring the boundaries between
literary and extra- or, as i now say, post-literary poetry.  remaining w/in
the literary just feels too claustrophobic.

As I read this I felt very hopeless and afraid. Thanks for sending it
along, Gary, I needed some old-fashioned feminist-type validation. Esp.
since I am re-reading Kawabata these days, & bifurcating psychologically in
response: joy at the exquisite clarity / depression in realizing that what
I'm responding to is "Daddy"'s voice: zen-Daddy's story of the world as I
don't know it......but wish I did. Even after all these years. And as
people go pomping along in Daddy-voices they *really* believe are
transparent, I-with/out-that-language (though hey, I
love/respond-Pavlovianly-to that voice sometimes too) know how to listen
politely and decipher and translate and reconstitute... But that little
magic act is sometimes
annoying/tiresome/fill-in-the-blank-with-any-exhausted-human-response. The
Daddy-static can be as glaring as a workshop poem's faux transparency to a
language poet.

We still have the original of Firebird by Paul Metcalf, mentioned by Damon
in his post below, available here at Chax Press. Published as a limited
edition letterpress work, with frontispiece illustration and linoleum
blocks as section titles.

Also, what bookstores? I haven't been in one in a very long time that had
any Paul Metcalf books at all.

A Reading 8-10 still available from Chax Press (email me). A smaller book,
that includes Dahlen's "A Reading Spicer" as well as 17 sonnets by her,
will be available in April from Chax.

Re Titles
I think of titles (for poems, books, artworks, etc.) rather the same way I
do names for pets and children.  For the most part, I like to meet the thing
before naming it... but sometimes the name generates the thing.  (I have a
name picked out already for the dog I anticipate getting in about a year.)
For poems, my titles are often more indicative of the general circumstances
under which a poem was written, rather than any sort of "content."  ('m the
sort who writes a note or an essay if I have a message.)  I love Maureen
Owen's titles and subtitles -- which remind me of the chapter titles of
18th-19th century novels (or of Winnie-the-Pooh books), beginning "In
which..."

Re Time/Shape
I'm intrigued by this notion, though it's very difficult to articulate. Time
is somewhat wave-like for me, always advancing and receding simultaneously.
Both past and future seem pretty abstract -- but past more malleable and
future more clouded over. My memories seem almost random to me... and about
as real as the imagined future.

Dear Jesse & List:

The field of Ethnomethodology has produced some produced some interesting
work, one study coming to mind is : "Ethnomethodology and the Study of Online
Communities: Exploring the Cyber Streets" by Steven Thomsen, Joseph
Straubhhaar and Drew Bolyard.

Their analysis reveals that one function of a group was for associational
purposes, an attempt to understand the contributions of partcipation to the
development of self-esteem and self-validation, particularly for those
members who felt they suffered from both social and professional isolation.

Best,

where did the classification names on this come from (Kinetic, etc.).
(Aside: I'm worried about them).

Meant to be more exact, but I'm having trouble connecting to the EPC
today.

I do look forward to this section "blooming" like many other EPC
sections have over the years.

Second aside: how many sites can you say you've actually used/visited
somewhat consistantly "over the years." And how many of them aren't
portals/search engines.

I enjoy titles. I enjoy writing them, too.

To me they are all about contextualizing the poem. Not to say that I
think the title should be "about" the same thing the poem is "about."
But in terms of heirarchies of meaning, titles hold a pretty impressive
and huge spot that one definitely needs to be wary of. When publications
print more than one of somebody's poems and the TOC just says "J. Smith,
Three Poems" a great deal of the titles power is lost (not a bad thing
always).

Band names/Pen Names/Alter Egos are all strongly related to titling.

Working on a formal series for a while now, I have a whole list of
titles for these poems. Some of them take, some of them don't, some of
them are cannibalised into later poems. All of them employ different
strategies: clarifying, obfuscating, describing something in the poem,
describing something else, hooky titles, funny titles, seeds for
improvisation, collected phrases, etc. I fear committing to one titling
strategy as much as I fear one of any other strategy.

Some title forms I enjoy:
<>Titles that are really just the first line of the poem (not the first
line of the poem repeated in a larger font at the top of the page) and
you just don't know how to read it correctly
<>Many works by one author using the same title that then need to be
differentiated in other ways by readers/classifiers
<>Numbered series (roman numerals or not)
<>Those really long titles old Chinese poetry in translation tends to
employ (Standing on the Dock in December Reading a line of Sun Tzu While
Boats Wander), I esp. hope that these are completely fabricated
situations, tho I know they probably are not
<>AP Headline writing style
<>Whoever recently did an alphabet series, with titles that went "Aa"
"Bb" like a primer. I think it's in Germ (I'm at work where many of my
magazines are not)? The poet or the magazine's designer/editor coupled
those with a good font choice. Those were really nice.
<>I'm a sucker for the Untitled oxymoron as well

least enjoyed title style:
<>a word or phrase that is then used in the work. Noticed/was bothered
by this most when it was happening in a lot of mid-90s prose. It was
like taking a neon highlighter to the word or phrase when it finally
came up in the work. Like the "emphasis" or "focus" analog to a
sledgehammer.

I completely agree about Speak magazine....Speak out of San Fransisco is a
great venue for interesting writing and art and the like...not only is the
format interesting, but they have a big readership...which is more (on bopth
counts) than most academic lit journals....I was lucky enough to have a
flash fiction published as the first in their sudden fiction series...

you should also look into Elixir magazine out of Eugene and Plazm magazine
out of Portland

The primary question, mine, which is quite different than
the discussion on the list so far is:
When did what the author intended
become important? Who cares?
This seems to be that ole textual McGann hullabaloo
all over again & little to do with "cultural capital"
or Bourdieu. The ease of the transition for one to change
private to public information on e-mail, hits me as a new twisting
on textual situations. David Kellogg maybe opinionated
on this & prob p-o'd, but it is a different scale to measure, a clash
of authorial intent's measure in the mix.

As one just joining this discussion, the question is one of intellectual

belonging, to whom is belonged in the process of neglected intention.
Is "this" mine? Are we at the segment of intent called meaning?
Authorial intention is beyond the author's controlling capacity
once something is written, it's part of the gig.

Be well

Oh for Christ's sake will you listen to yourself.  It is in my view=20
unethical either (1) to move things from one private list to another, and=
=20
(2) to "out" backchannel discussions without clearing with all parties. =20
Now you justify the first by doing the second with my message? =20

I don't care about the content of the thread per se, but I wish you'd=20
stop trying to justify your actions through theorization and perpetuation=
=20
(since you have continued the practice by forcing my backchannel message=20
to the front.  (No) thanks.)

Cheers,
David

"Gordon Massman's decades-long sequence of poems, The Numbers, is a
hydra-headed, incantatory howl honoring the appetite that gorges on
spillage from the riptides of desire and its near-spiritual
flesh-fruits. In other words, it's a good antidote to not feeling alive.
" -- Jack Myers

"Gordon Massman's poetry graphically speaks of love and passion,
alienation and connection, the father-son relationship, the demons that
haunt the human soul, and the spirit which at all costs overcomes
thepower of emotional honesty--with all the gifts of an award-winning
author. Simply stated, The Numbers is one of the finest collections of
poems I have come across in many years." -- Charles Rowell, editor of

Subject: <nettime> Do not exhibit any longer in Austria!

Nantes, 2.2.2000

Dear friends,

As you know, Austria got today the first federal government since the end
of World War Second with a big participation of nazis.

I am born in this country, have lived there for 24 years, now writing for
almost twenty years in austrian newspapers, studied political history
(history of democracy...) in this country. Also through my familly, I know
in detail the inside stories of the FPOe - a party founded in 1948, after
the amnesty for the big nazi rulers, to be a legal cover for their
activity. In 1986, Joerg Haider took over the party by a putsch with the
aim to re-establish these origins, and to rehabilitate the nazi period in
Austria, and if possible in Central Europe.

The actual danger is much beyond Austria: in five years or, let's say,
after the death of Vaclav Havel, whole Central Europe can burn in the same
way like Austria now. The Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, etc. are
ready to follow this political choice.

Regarding Austria, I am convinced since 1983, when Bruno Kreisky retired,
the first Jewish chancelor in Central Europe since the birth of mankind,
that this spectacular comeback of the Nazis must occure.

For contemporary arts, I see only one possible choice:

1. NO LONGER EXHIBIT OR COOPERATE WITH AUSTRIA

It has now become absolutely impossible, in moral terms, for any artist,
galerist, museum curator or collector, to exhibit any longer in Austria,
or to cooperate with any Austrian institution. There is only one question
to ask: would you have exhibited in Nazi-Germany? Only with a complete
boycott of the local artlife, we can help the Austrian artists to survive.
The new government wants to show that "everything is as before", regarding
individual liberty. Since 1995, all international known Austrian artists
are under pressure by the party of Joerg Haider; anonymous phone calls,
Nazi-signs on their cars, menaces to take their children - since five
years, many internationally known artists in Vienna are only moving with
their familly in the city inside of closed cars. As far as I know, most of
the jewish community is also behaving like this, because they were
constantly aggressed in the street. During the "100 Years" exhibition in
1998, the Vienna Secession had constantly nazi-signs, painted during the
night, on the building; the Austrian federal police refused to consider
these facts, saying that "this is normal". The next years will be very
hard for Austrian artists.  They all talked to me in the last years or
months about leaving the country.  Even half of the actual students at the
Vienna Academy were thinking about leaving the country. For a writer, an
intellectual, this is relatively easy.  For an artist, to change the
country is very complicated. The only way to help them, is to boycott the
country itself. If you show to the Austrian population that the new
government is outlaw, then - but ONLY then - the woters may consider
during the next elections in 2003 that this may have been a bad choice for
their country.

2. HELP THE AUSTRIAN ARTISTS AS INDIVIDUALS

There can not be any preference for Austrian artists, but for you,
international collegues, it is just about passing them a phone call or a
mail from time to time, taking care of them in some sense, just hearing if
they are ok and able to work and to exhibit. You all have very many
contacts with Austrian artists. Staying in contact with people ouside can
be very important for each of them.

I was born in this country, and as one of very few still active
international critics in this country, I have a heavy responsability. With
the nomination of the new government, I announced publically to stop my
collaboration for the big exhibition about the young art scene in Vienna
(other curators:  Paolo Herkenhoff, Maaretta Jaukkuri, Rosa Martinez)
scheduled for Oct. 2000-April 2001 at Kunsthalle Vienna; to stop any
collaboration with Austrian institutions; no longer going to Austria
before the end of the nazi-participation in the government; trying to
change citizenship. But I will stay as much as possible in contact with
the Austrian artists, through the fact that I have a very close
relationship with all artists generations there, from the generation of
the pioneers of an independend art life (Maria Lassnig, Arnulf Rainer), to
the young students.

Best Wishes,
Robert Fleck

MIME-Version: 1.0

mark du charme,

this is not a question i ever really addressed.  i'm sure there are many
different reasons for writing poetry.  however, to quote a friend, "it is not
what we say we believe in, but what effects our actions have."  i thought
that bourdieu was a necessary corrective for the attitude that will not or
cannot consider the social conditions of artistic practice.   let me answer
more fully w/ a paraphrase to a response i gave to a similar question on
another listserve:

i don't think that what bourdieu is interested in is the poet's *intentions*
per se--just that, if one is going to present a model of a social practice,
intentions, motives, self-interest and so on are some of the things agents do
act on.  but in fact these things are finally what is indeterminable in his
analysis.  that is, the "disposition" of any individual agent cannot be
predicted or wholly accounted for--he or she may in fact operate against his
or her self-interests, calculate these self-interests in different ways, etc.
 b. is talking instead about the *statisitical* probability (or regularity)
that an agent will, in situation X, under the conditions of y, etc, etc. (&
w/ all of these factors being understood to work dynamically) will act in
such and such a way.  of course one could then go on, as i do, in feeling (a
little) uncomfortable about the status of statistical  (i.e. scientific)
knowledge in his thinking.

hard to know how to respond to this question as several differing sorts of
mail are involved -- We've had some discussion of this in the past,
particulalry following Dale Smith's publication of emails from this list in
his magazine without securing permission from any of the correspondents --
a move that needs to be remembered as people read varied anti-Buffalo -list
comments made from certain quarters --

As I said at the time, I have to assume that anything I post to a listserv
might very well reappear elsewhere on the net -- I do not believe people
should routinely re-post such items when they are not simply informational,
but I expect it to happen and write accordingly -- I also expect that
anything I post directly to somebody might be quoted or copied by that
person in a subsequent post -- which is already the case with hard copy
letters -- Doesn't meant that I like it, just that I really should not be
surprised if it happens --

On the other hand, I'd be truly disturbed if a private communication to one
person were hijacked electronically by some third party --

It's not clear from what we've been told that anything along those lines
has happened  -- Has subpoetics ever posted any "rules" about reposting, as
the poetics list has?  I think the governing rule of any community on or
off-line should be established by the membership of the community --

I read other people's mail every day in the course of my research -- most
of them are deceased -- but not all --

a physical letter becomes the property of the recipient, while its contents
may be covered by copyright -- If an analogy fits in the e-world, then it
might well be considered unethical to repost an entire message without the
sender's permission, but OK to quote a portion --

though I know there are many on-line who would prefer a more anarchic
approach to all such questions and view the net as a place to contest the
"ownership" of writing --

Lots of questions here -- none of which have ever been fully aired despite
our frequent discussion of them --

It is one of the top discussion/debate sites for scientists and
philosophers of science. The list of contributors is a who's who of
"public figures" and best-selling authors of science-for-the-
layperson, from Richard Dawkins, to Steven Pinker, to George
Lakoff, to Marvin Minsky, even Brian Eno. The following is from
Princeton astrophysicist Piet Hut, part of a current forum with
dozens of responses by prominent folks to the question, (if I have it
right), "What is the most underreported story of the decade?" Feed
Magazine (which I remember Ron Silliman plugging a couple years
ago)

http://feed.org
now has a partnership with Edge, and a number of the
contributions to this forum can also be found there.

Hut's response is wonderful in itself (though I suppose his response
really doesn't exist, according to its own claims!) but also in the
likeness of its proposals to some key ideas of Fenollosa via
Pound. Or at least it seems suggestively similar in that regard to
me:

------------------------------

There Are No Things

That's right. No thing exists, there are only actions. We live in a
world of verbs, and nouns are only shorthand for those verbs whose
actions are sufficiently stationary to show some thing-like behavior.
These statements may seem like philosophy or poetry, but in fact
they are an accurate description of the material world, when we
take into account the quantum nature of reality.

Future historians will be puzzled by the fact that this interpretation
has not been generally accepted, 75 years after the discovery of
quantum mechanics. Most physics text books still describe the
quantum world in largely classical terms. Consequently anything
quantum seems riddled with paradoxes and weird behavior. One
generally talks about the "state" of a particle, such as an electron,
as if it really had an independent thing-like existence, as in
classical mechanics. For example, the term `state vector' is used,
even though its operational properties belie almost anything we
normally associate with a state.

Two voices have recently stressed this verb-like character of reality,
those of David Finkelstein, in his book Quantum Relativity, and of
David Mermin, in his article "What is quantum mechanics trying to
tell us" [1998, Amer. J. of Phys. 66, 753]. In the words of the
second David: `"Correlations have physical reality; that which they
correlate does not.'" In other words, matter acts, but there are no
actors behind the actions; the verbs are verbing all by themselves
without a need to introduce nouns. Actions act upon other actions.
The ontology of the world thus becomes remarkably simple, with
no duality between the existence of a thing and its properties:
properties are all there is. Indeed: there are no things.

Two hundred years ago, William Blake scolded the physicists for
their cold and limited view of the world, in terms of a clockwork
mechanism, in which there was no room for spontaneity and
wonder. Fortunately, physicists did not listen to the poet, and
pushed on with their program. But to their own utter surprise, they
realized with the discovery of quantum mechanics that nature
exhibits a deeply fundamental form of spontaneity, undreamt of in
classical physics. An understanding of matter as dissolving into a
play of interactions, partly spontaneous, would certainly have
pleased Blake.

What will be next? While physics may still seem to lack a
fundamental way of touching upon meaning and wonder, who is to
say that those will remain forever outside the domain of physics?
We simply do not know and cannot know what physics will look
like, a mere few hundred years from now.

There is an analogy with computer languages. Physicists have a
traditional aversion to learning any other language than Fortran,
with which they grow up, no matter how useful the other languages
may be. But without ever parting from their beloved Fortran, it was
Fortran that changed out from under them, incorporating many of
the features that the other languages had pioneered. So, when
asked how future physicists will program, a good answer is: we
have not the foggiest idea, but whatever it is, it will still be called
Fortran.

Similarly, our understanding of the material world, including the
very notion of what matter and existence is, is likely to keep
changing radically over the next few hundred years. In what
direction, we have no idea. The only thing we can safely predict is
that the study of those wonderful new aspects of reality will still be
called physics.

I have found that if I leave a poem untitled for more than a few months, it
becomes more and more difficult to imagine one. I've often resorted, as
someone has mentioned, to using the first line as a title in these cases.
When putting my first book together, however, I didn't think this was
"authentic" enough, and I didn't think  putting "Untitled" was cool either.
So I just left the top blank. The publisher was then forced to use
asterisks in places to mark that a poem had come to an end, if  the top of
the next poem was also left blank. On the other hand, some years ago I
discovered that if I would just jot down a title I thought of, not having
the time to write the poem, no matter how long I waited, some poem could be
crystallized around that title, as if somehow the potential poem, or many
potential poems, lay waiting to emerge from the larval state of the title.
But then I got lazy and started letting the titles accumulate in my
notebooks as objects in themselves.

It's great to see how so many of us deal with the problems of titling poems:
Leave untitled, use Untitled as title, use first words of poem, wait till poem
ends and then find a succinct form to use as title. I've gone through all
myself, but for visual poems, most of mine I leave untitled because I don't want
to force their imagery in a direction chosen by me, the way a legend under a
news photo detracts from the photographic immediacy. Other visual poems, I
simply incorporate the title in the poem.

I can also add a few things to the idea of titling.

My Visual Voices: The Poem As a Print Object contains three poems whose subject
is titling.

1. "Clock-Title Poem" demonstrates that a title above the work is the
conventional place used for poems; a title below the work is conventional for
works of art in frames; a title on the wall adjacent to the work is used for
modern works of visual art, displays, dioramas, etc. In other words, poem title
at 12 o'clock, display case title at 3 or 9 o'clock, visual artwork on wall,
title at 6 o'clock.

I have composed visual poems that I call Wallpoems because I want them to be
exhibited where pictures usually are; they always begin with a line of words to
stress that they are, basically, poems; and they  continue with a mix of words
and images. Since I think of them as poems, I choose to title them at the top of
the page.

2. "Poem Invisible of the Seven Journeys through the Magnetic Zone between the
Title and the Poem"

This poem presupposes that there is always a gap of meaning between title and
poem that the poet can do little about and that may bother the reader. There is
an empty mental space between what the title promises and the poem fulfills. My
poem offers possible *meanings* to fill the gap.  We can  NOT put up a title. Or
we  can title it Poem (or Untitled in the manner of visual artists).

One wonders where abstract artists get their often elaborate titles from that
are of no help to the viewer.

3. "Face to Face, Or, The Title as Field Commanders Assembling the Poem as a
Body of Three Platoons With Rear Guard"

If you print a poem upside-down so that it faces the title (or print the
title-upside down), the arrangement demonstrates the commanding importance of
the title's relation to the poem, calling it to order. The idea is that all
titles call a poem to order.

Subject:      poetry syllabus
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi List,

I'm going to be teaching a course at UC Santa Cruz
this summer on Contemporary American Poetry,
and I thought it might be useful/ interesting/
inflammatory/etc. to run a draft of my syllabus
past anyone out there who has nothing better to do
than my work for me.  (BTW, I'm cross-posting
this to both the subsub and Beefalo lists.)

It's a five-week intensive course that meets
three times a week for two and a half hours a day,
and an obvious problem is fitting as much in
as possible without overloading the students
(most of whom will probably be pretty new
to [insert your favorite adjective here] poetry).
That goal may ultimately be impossible, but
I'd love to get feedback on this.

The selections here are largely but not exclusively
from Paul Hoover's Norton anthology,
_Postmodern American Poetry_.  Since I want to keep
the required texts affordable, I'm trying to limit
them to Hoover and a photocopied course reader
(although I'm tempted to require Ashbery's
_Tennis Court Oath_, Hejinian's _My Life_,
and Will Alexander's _Towards the Primeval
Lightning Field_, among others, in their entirety).
I'm trying also to limit the content of the reader
to critical texts as much as possible (e.g. excerpts
from Spicer's dictation lecture, Silliman's
_New Sentence_, the passage from Jameson's
_Postmodernism_ on Perelman's "China, "
Bernadette Mayers' writing experiments, etc.),
but there are some poems Hoover doesn't include
that I just have to put in--Ashbery's "Daffy Duck
in Hollywood," Coolidge's "Bee Elk," and so on.

That much being said, I'd like especially to hear
from people about what kinds of things they
think should be taught about the poets I've listed,
and even about what poets I should be whipped
for omitting (or, I guess, for _not_ omitting)
Of course, it's simply not possible to fit everyone in
that I'd like to.  I've reluctantly disincluded biggies like
Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Ed Dorn,
James Schuyler, Rosmarie Waldrop, Steve McCaffery,
Johanna Drucker, David Bromige, David Antin--
you get the idea.  Some of these are favorites
of mine, and there might be persuasive
arguments for putting some of them back;
but then who gets the axe?  Such power!

Keep in mind that I've subtitled the course "from Beat
to Postlanguage" (note: I definitely _will_ acknowledge
the contested status of that second label), and
that my more or less arbitrary starting point is poets
who were fairly new in the '50s. Hence no readings
from Stein, Zukofsky, etc.; though maybe I'll print
up some handouts for the first day.

I must admit to feeling a little guilty that
the reading list seems kind of doctrinaire--like
a kind of official unofficial verse culture primer.
I've left out poets I'm crazy about, to be honest,
simply because I don't know quite what to do
with them (e.g., Diane Wakoski, James Tate,
Russell Edson).  Still, I feel pretty settled on
the basic selection rationale, which largely
consists of sampling the Don Allen _New American
Poetry_ categories plus Second Gen New York School,
Language, and whatever it is that has grown out of /
around / on top of that.

Another thing: you'll surely notice that
with one or two exceptions, the poets on this
syllabus are all grown up and already canonized at some level,
either to the point of godhood (Ginsberg, Ashbery)
or a slightly less Olympian but still "recognized"
cult status (DiPalma, Elmslie). I've reserved a day--
yes, one measly day--at the end of the five weeks
to look at some more recent and less known writers:
that is, many of the persons who subscribe to this list.
Rather than face the hideous prospect of singling
out individual authors from among the vast foamy
sea of talent out there, I thought I'd try something
a little different: spend a whole session passing
around little magazines and chapbooks that feature
the turkiest of the young turks who are just
dying to be converted into academic fossils
before their time.  Now this might seem like
a cheap ploy to get free goodies (maybe on some
dark, loathsome level of my unscrupulous psyche,
it is--gasp), but anyone out there who would like
to be a part of this great experiment might
consider sending chapbooks of their work, or if
they're editors, their magazines, etc.  Consider
it publicity.  One editor has already expressed interest
in possibly supplying several copies of a certain journal
for the class, which is actually where I got the idea
for this. I want to expose students not just to individual
writers, but to a whole spectrum of material poetic production
out there: self-publishing, small presses, broadsides,
electronic formats (though I don't know if I'm going
to be technologically capable of bringing web stuff
to the classroom on a mass level), lo-fi and hi-res
bookmaking, and so on.

If anyone is interested in this hare-brained scheme,
please b/c me for my address or further info or just
to tell me what you think.

        or,  What the hell to call this one ?


"The process of titlization cannot be understood outside means of poetic
production and by virtue of its hierachical placement always already assumes
an ideologically determining role in the reception of the poem.  Titlization
is the process by which the subject is pinned to the ground of the
superstructure by the assumptions the poem and it's arbitrary
poetic-enabling subjectivity is blind to."

        sometimes i hate titles
        other times i dont
        sometimes i have a title and i wait for a long time before trying to
write the poem that will appear under it
        sometimes this doesnt work and i still have the title and the poem
gets another title
        othertimes it does work
        sometimes i too have titled things with the 1st line
          or the last line
         or parts of two or more lines
          or just a line that i liked in the middle somewhere
        once a poem of mine without a title was criticized by a friend of
mine b/c they hated one line so i made that line the title of the poem
        sometimes i take lines from songs and make them into titles
        i dont know for sure but with single poems, not part of a larger
sequence, i probably come up with the title after more often than before or
during
        sometimes i do think of the title during the poem
        sometimes i do like the title to be like a spotlight
        othertimes i like it to obscure things or confuse things
        many times i dont know where thwe title comes from and after much
thought about everything and doubt and 2nd guessing every line of the poem
i'll spit out a title with no thought at all
        sometimes i use a single title for lots of poems and add a number
(READING ONE, READING TWO... WREADING NINE etc) other times i dont add a
number and every poem in the series is just a ____ (a "stoppage," of james
sander's sequence "Poems for Wrestlers" etc)
        one time i wrote a poem with a very long title (it took 3 lines) for
which the poem was ony two words but i lost this poem and now i dunno what
it was anymore
        somebody i remember had a thing where the titles appeared at the end
of the poem but i cant remember who that was --- i thought it was kinda cool
        i've thought about using pictures for titles but never gotten around
to it
        ditto for producing a contents page for a "lost book" so that the
titles wd have to stand alone with only their relation to other titles and
the lengths suggested by the page numbers as a way of thinking about them
        i like poems without titles somebody on this thread mentioned how
they seem to soak up the page around them --- this seems right to me
        randy prunty has a bunch of poems that are titled along these lines
"untitled poem about _____________" with the blank filed with almost
anything
        maybe because titles seem to suggest their import and relevance i've
always tended to treat them frivolously

marketing jargon. Brenda is currently a teaching artist through the
Westchester Arts Council visiting Artist’s Program, the Herbert Mark
Newman Theater Arts-in-Education program, the Mid-Fairfield Child
Guidance Center C.H.O.I.C.E.S. after School Program, the Taconic
Correctional Facility for Women, the PROMISES after School program in
Ossining, and the Neuberger Museum Artists in the Schools program.  She
is the recipient of a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship for
Fiction, a NYS CAPS award for poetry, and four PEN awards for fiction
and non-fiction.  She is also a MacDowell and YADDO Fellow.  Her poetry

journals.  Brenda’s first collection of fiction and poetry is entitled
Thoughts of An Everyday Woman/An Unfinished Urban Folktale.  She has
completed a collection of poetry, Crossroad of the Serpent and a
children’s book How Boy With Flattened Face Got His New Name. Currently,
she is working on a novel, The House on Blackwell Lane. Formerly an

Karen Wilson is the recipient of a BRIO Fellowship from the Bronx
Council of the Arts. She is storyteller -in- residence through Arts in
Education at Elizabeth Morrow School in Englewood, NJ. She is a
performer with wide appeal, enthralling children, teenagers and adults
alike.  Her performances include Ain’t I A Woman: African American Women
Reflect American History,  for the “Meet the Artist Series” at Lincoln
Center in New York City;  Celebrate the Earth (ATIS) at the Children’s
Museum in Manhattan; and Songs, Stories and Whatnot for Grownups at
Speakeasy in NYC. She has also created works and performed for The
Harlem School of the Arts and Clearwater’s Hudson River Revival. In
1998, NWCA featured Karin Wilson’s performance of Beauty and the Blues
-the Prose and Poems,  an adaptation of her popular performance, Beauty
and the Blues, which premiered at the Hudson River Museum in February
1997. Through songs and stories, Karen Wilson recreates the realities of
African people: whether on their home continent or as they and their
descendants moved to new homes across the Western Hemisphere. In the way
that African fabrics embrace many colors and African musics embrace many
sounds, Karen embraces many different cultures in her storytelling. Her
stories touch issues of family and community, relationships in conflict,
the importance of responsibility and the power of change. Come and
listen: your laughing and clapping will make you part of the event in
true African fashion.  You may even find yourself singing in one of
Karen’s thirteen singing languages right along with her! Karen is a
performer with wide appeal, enthralling children, teenagers and adults

TWO MILLION AMERICANS WILL BE BEHIND BARS BY FEBRUARY 15

Study posted at <http://www.cjcj.org/punishingdecade>

Washington, DC -- The Justice Policy Institute reports that
the U.S. Prison and Jail population will top two million for
the first time on February 15, 2000 the day after the nation
celebrates Valentine's Day. Using the most up to date
Justice Department statistics and trends, the Institute
estimates that the U.S. now has the world's largest
incarcerated population, and highest incarceration rate.
Just six weeks into the new millennium, America has earned
the distinction of having a quarter of the world's prison
population, despite having less than 5% of the world's
population.

"There is little to celebrate this Valentines day," stated
Vincent Schiraldi, Director of the Justice Policy Institute.
"The ascendance of prisons as our decade's major public
works project and social program is a sad and costly legacy."

JPI's report, "The Punishing Decade: Prison and Jail
Estimates at the Millennium," shows that the imprisoned
population grew at a faster rate during the 1990s than
during any decade in recorded history. America entered
the 1990s with 1,145,300 inmates in its jails and prisons.
December 31, 1999, there were an estimated 1,983,084 adults
behind bars, and by the end of the year there will be 2,073,969.

The prison growth during the 1990s dwarfed the growth of any
previous decade;  it exceeded the prison growth of the 1980s
by 61%, and is nearly 30 times the average prison population
growth of any decade prior to the 1970s.

The Institute estimated that $39 billion will be spent
to operate America's prisons and jails by yearend 1999,
a figure which will grow to $41 billion by yearend 2000.
The Institute also reported that, in 1995, states around
the country spent more building prisons than building
universities for the first time and that 2/3 of those
incarcerated in prison and jail (approximately 1.2 million
inmates) are imprisoned for non-violent offenses.

"Halfway through black history month, our prisons and jails
represent the sad reality that one out of three young
African American males are under some form of criminal
justice control," stated Jason Ziedenberg, Policy Analyst at
the Institute. "Two million prisoners is too many, and the
nation must find alternatives to incarceration to solve
America's pressing social problems."

Subject:      The APG Manifesto
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Fellow listers:

As one of the many unofficial spokespersons for the APG, I have been elected (by a democratic vote) to post this, The APG Manifesto, to the list.  It is a little something we threw together over pizza last week.  Some members were not present at last weeks meeting, so we waited till all membership had chance to view, alter, and sign this document (members residing outside of Atlanta were express mailed the manifesto) before posting it for public scrutiny.  I, of course, helped to draft and then signed the document and stand by its proclamations, but I am mostly the messenger in regards to its posting (please keep this in mind).

The APG: Radical Ideas - Not Dead Poetics

The Atlanta Poets Group (APG) was launched as an organization by poets who rejected the popular poetics of the mainstream which helped facilitate the formation of conglomerate publishers and booksellers. Instead of worrying about our media image we have returned to our poetic roots. This manifesto sets out our proposals on key issues based on that poetic philosophy.

The Poetic Alternative

The APG stands for the creation of an open poetic and is against all forms of limitism and
vested interest. The hallmark of the APG is the faith it places in poets and communities.  The APG
wants everyone, not just the educated and the most able, to have the maximum opportunity to express themselves poetically.

By rejecting limitism and vested interests, the APG has historically been a generator of new
poetics; poetics often adopted much later by others. We are proud to continue that tradition and in
this manifesto are many radical ideas that contrast sharply with the bland consensus so prevalent in Atlanta today and furthered by the works of the mainstream.

Not The Workshop

The Apg does not seek merely to adopt a radical position between workshop poetics and avant-gardism.
Instead we try to apply new and radical poetic principles and are not afraid when this leads us to unconventional conclusions.

What is a Radical Poetic?

Both workshop poetics and avant-gardism  talk about "the poetics of the individual", but they mean
different things by that phrase. Workshop poetics sees poetics in a narrow economic/social term. Avant-gardism has a much broader view of poetics.

Cooperative ventures, member participation and community involvement are all on the APG
agenda. Our aim is to spread poetics to give people real influence over the ideas that affect
them. However, we also believe that the process of spreading poetics must not be paternalistic
and that new structures must evolve in response to real needs rather than being imposed from
above.

A consequence of our view of poetics is an attitude of tolerance towards the unemployed poet , travelling poets, gay poets, single mother poets and many other poets who have found to their cost that the mainstream view of poetics does not include them.

Socialistic Poetics

Socialistic poetics aim to achieve poetry through planning and regulation. Because this involves
action on behalf of the disadvantaged poets of society it has always had the sympathy of
the APG. But the APG believes that state planning is usually ineffective and that poetics are not the
prime objective. We aim for a good standard of poetics for all. The APG does believe strongly in equal poetics and thus has some aims in common with socialists.

The Danger of Tyrannical Poetics

As our society becomes more aggressive and less stable, authoritarian solutions can seem
attractive. This is an increasing problem, not just in Atlanta but around the world. Fear leads to
demands for quick action and avant-gardism rather than a carefully thought out poetic. Simplistic solutions, the scapegoating and oppression of certain poetics and the stifling end product of criticism are the inevitable results.

Against this the APG's quest for poetics leads us to a love for reason and debate. Our poetic ensures that decisions are made after due debate and deliberation, on the basis of good ideas, and with better protection against the abuses of criticism.

A Practical Approach to Poetics

We are not armchair theorists or poets. The ideas and proposals in this manifesto have been worked out
and debated by members of the APG on the basis of their experience, drawn from many
different walks of life and from active poeting.

All we ask is that you read what we have to say, consider it with an open mind and, if you agree
with the principles of our poetic, join us!

Making Peace

The best means of achieving collective poetics is by working to resolve conflicts through
negotiation at an early stage (before any shooting starts).

The APG Proposes

     Basic changes in modern poetics to make them more clearly impartial and less a tool of the mainstream

The APG Opposes

     The international poetry trade



The APG believes that we should be more flexible and open minded in our approach to poetics.
We advocate a transfer of poetic commitment and money from the mainstream to experimental poetics.

By experimental poetics we mean the techniques of arbitration, reconciliation work in areas of
potential conflict, rebuilding the social and poetic structure of areas where a fragile peace has
been established and study of the causes and resolution of poetics. The development and
maintenance of poetics is also important: it is not by chance that there has rarely been a war
between two poetic communities.

Experimental poetics have tended to be ignored, leading to situations developing with no action
being taken until the options have become very limited (as in the case of The Spanish American War).

A Stronger Poetic

We are committed to strengthening poetics, giving it new powers to actively resolve disputes, to
enforce the local community, to promote good living and to prevent substantial damage to good living. To do this however, it must be seen as impartial.

We are the only poetic group to advocate the addition new poetic agencies to promote poetics and poetic protection.

There is now real hope for poetics in the world if early stage intervention by the APG
can be made acceptable.

The APG is committed to the abandonment of the Trident system and all inter-continental ballistics and other weapons of indiscriminate destruction.

We wish to maintain experimental poetics and professional, well equipped and  well trained poets good
enough to defend poetics as a legitimate interest. We would always insist on every avenue of diplomacy,
non-military action and negotiation being exhausted before embarking on military action.

the card on the wall. there for viewer orientation, and best not too
precious or obvious, unless blatantly utilitarian. my favorite cards
include materials, as well as artist's name & date. the visceral captions
that read "graphite, house paint, chalk, vaseline, sand." probably best not
to take the card too seriously, read in too much "meaning." just there to
make people feel a bit more secure & comfortable by offering the semblance
of "context"-- nothing (in my book) wrong with that. my titles generally
whatever I call the poem to myself when I'm writing it.

mark p, mark d --

you both point out some weaknesses in bourdieu's theories and i agree with
you in some respects. it seems entirely machiavellian to claim that all
writing purports to nothing more than besting one's rivals. to this extent
i may have misrepresented bourdieu; certainly his critics would charge him
with maintaining this as the bottom line, and i'm not sure what the proper
response would be. if tho there is something more to it, another answer to
the question "why write," my sense of bourdieu leads me to suggest the
following.

first, with mark d's sense of writing as a nonproductive activity that
partakes in a critique of utilitarian and capitalist values, bourdieu
would agree. his argument is that this commences in the mid-late 19th
century with the emergence of an autonomous aesthetic field that defines
itself in opposition to the dominant cultural values. now what such an
oppositional stance achieves -- how it might answer the questions "what
else there is" or "why write" by saying "it does x, y, z, etc.", -- is not
to my mind sufficiently elaborated in bourdieu.  so if in this sense
bourdieu is not "helpful" to poets, i concede the point.

second, the notion of habitus -- the way you carry yourself in the world,
a set of dispositions that is both innate and culturally determined --
inclines a poet to have and develop a "feel for the game." in other words
a poet when posed the question "why write" is already disposed to respond
in certain ways and presumably continues to develop further that response.
my invocation of "naivety" was not at all in an accusatory mode but rather
as a limit case, a practical impossibility, i.e. the poet who writes with
no preconceived sense of poetic value and sends out work either entirely
indiscriminately or not at all.  my point is that *everyone* has a feel
for the game, which is manifest whenever one writes one (kind of) poem
instead of another, choses to submit one poem for publication over
another, or to one journal over another, reads/buys one journal over
another, befriends or otherwise engages with other poets, etc.  and i also
think that everyone is *conscious*, to some degree, of such questions as
well.  what bourdieu would go on to claim is that those who have a more
nuanced awareness of the above are more likely to "succeed" i.e. accrue
and maintain symbolic capital -- arguably, no doubt.

one very real way of seeing literal and/or symbolic capital at work in
poetic production is in terms of networks and networking, no?  i mean,
you can bemoan and decry their existence and refuse to engage them, or go
the other way and enslave yourself to them, neither of which i think is
particularly healthy.  but i can't see mark p's claim that such
considerations "lead nowhere," are "very uninteresting and unhelpful,
either to readers and poets," or do not clarify "what is actually going
on." true, cultural capital, like any other concept, risks being turned
into a knee-jerk, and is always only as useful as the kinds of questions
it allows you to answer and then turn into further questions. toril moi
has a good essay in the december 1997 modern language quarterly about why
u.s. academic criticism thus far has *not* produced truly bourdieuian
results in part b/c of the difficulty of obtaining the "empirical
evidence" that they seem to require.

so if you wanted to appraise the symbolic or cultural capital of, say, a
periodical, a cool thing to have might be circulation information like who
was actually a subscriber and/or how many were sold in what bookstores,
etc.  such info is not easily obtained, tho, but i'd still like to see it
before i decide whether it leads anywhere or is interesting or useful.

a much better example i think is a critique of the long-standing division
in contemporary american poetry (since at least Allen's NAP) between
academic/mainstream and experimental/alternative poetries; one real way to
demonstrate how the landscape has changed in forties years to the effect
that such a distinction doesn't hold much water anymore is to make the
case that a significant number of emerging practitioners whom one might
align in the experimental camp actually hold university accreditation.
the schwarz/stroffolino/jarnot anthology attests to this in a way that
requires us to rethink the distinction. which to me is interesting and
useful in and of itself and for what it suggests might actually be going
on.

bests,
t.

Hi Maria,

First, yes, I am talking about the literary field--or more exactly the field
of experimental poetry.  Why?  Because I am interested to know how a poem, an
artwork--something in & of itself *valueless*--is seen to acquire
*value*--what amounts finally to a *belief* in that value--but which is,
thus, in some sense, only an *illusory* value --a fetish, perhaps.  But this
is, in itself, also a *post*literary interest, no?  Only coming from the
*opposite* direction as you.  Nor does the contest for symbolic capital
ever--or only rarely--occur with any particular degree of conscious strategy,
or calculation.  The logic of the game excludes this, since the game itself
is based on an *illusion*.  Nor would your writing for your "sanity" at all
*exclude* you from the game because the game is played by agents who match
their own dispositions (unique dispositions, such as temperment, or general
dispositions, such as gender, educational status, etc.) to the possible
positions (of status, etc.) available in the field at any one time.
Bourdieu's point is that an agent will most often make those (what to him/her
*seem* entirely disinterested) aesthetic choices, judgements, values which
will most successfully match his/her unique disposition to the social
trajectory to which he/she aspires.  In fact, to some extent, one might say
that an identification with the extra literary (which I share, by the way, &
by which I mean to implicate myself as well) is merely a fantasy "projection
of relations *internal* to the field" (Bourdieu).

To the Poetics-list:

Well, I'm glad that Jacques Debrot's message below has a more civil  tone
than the backchannel version & it's follow up -- which of course I cant
properly forward to - or discuss on - this list.
       It makes replying seem less of a challenge to a word-battle between
irate doggie male egos. But it does require more essay-like space than I
believe this medium happily bears with.  Be advised, this is quite long: you
will know where your delete button is, dear reader.

        I have been giving some thought to the problem of the place of the
"pleasures of reading" within a description & analysis of social
structures -- as they affect "the arts" -- the scare-quotes relate to Maria
Damon's note to-day on post- or extra-literary writing, where the term
"poetry" becomes perhaps somewhat loosened from its usual literary moorings.
      The centre of this problem is "taste". It pervades enlightenment
criticism: it is stated influentially by Immanuel Kant; it is a central
issue for Greenbergian criticism; & it pervades also Thierry de Duve's
account of Duchamp (Kant after Duchamp, Ch. VIII), even as he substitutes
"art" for "taste" as the 1960s term in his rereading of Kant.
    I am not thinking of reading as an exercise of Kantian Taste -- which in
its context is actually a neo-classical problem of the ideal as manifested
in representations of the human form -- often as if it had no (back)ground &
was often made with no regard for the construction of the representation in
or by a medium.
       However there is a simplifying tendency (I've seen anthropologists do
it with "art" a lot & it's also apt to occur in psychology & sociology) to
suppose that the "reading" of texts, images & artefacts is a matter of
fitting them into a pre-existing discourse on social structures by way of a
kind of illustration, taking little or no notice of the relation between
contents & medium.  Anything else is by-passed as "subjective aesthetics" as
supposedly practised in the study & criticism of European arts.
        However, anyone who has ever studied the arts closely will know that
to substantiate any judgements there is an elaborate & complex preliminary
phase of working.  In most critical processes one would suppose a very close
attention to how the medium is worked, how it engages a reading with its
representations & how it engages with its interrogations & uses &
discoveries in & of the medium.  This may take a long time -- & in that time
the Subject  is submitting itself to the enigmatic & hitherto unknown
otherness of the poem or picture - whatever -- being looked into.
   That is where I find "the pleasure of reading".  If it does lead, as it
sometimes does, tho slowly, to some insight into the workings of the
artwork, then writing about that becomes another kind of pleasure.  The
process I am talking about requires something of "negative capability" & it
cannot be hurried or shortcut.   But if it isnt done or shortcut badly --
then  the value of any judgement made on it is diminished in value.  In
other words, the subject is busily engaged, but not
at the level of "pleasure & pain" as in the Kantian model.
        There is no problem about seeing such a subjective process as
producing something that can be incorporated into a theory of cultural
capital.   But it is not at the level of a correlation of "Taste"
(tendencies of groups as in fashion or discourse diminished to slogans &
vagueness of feeling) with "social levels".  (This is not, plainly, an
attempt to overturn Pierre Bourdieu's sociology: that wd be way beyond the
scope of what I'm attempting here).
        What is to be watched out for is the claim that criticism is all
subjective in a pejorative sense, meaning entirely arbitrary.  Or that
"poetry" is likewise subjective & arbitrary & therefore entirely to be
disposed of by reference to its supposed "social conditioning".  i.e. the
scoial and/or economic conditions which are conceived of as enveloping
them -- becoming causes  while the arts become effects.  This ensures a
certain capture of the territory of arts & critical discourse by
sociological discourse no doubt.

          I apologise for the unwonted length of this as e-mail.
   To be properly intelligible what I am saying here needs development at
greater length than this.

                                best   Tony Green

Ah, this is a can of worms to be sure, but I have to publicly make a pitch
for including Teresa Hak Kyung Cha's _Dictee_. I've taught this text to
"beginning" and "intermediate/advanced" students at San Francisco State with
excellent results. Will help to further discussions about definitions of
"poetry," the "visual arts," "identity," "race," "Nationhood." Can be used
to many useful pedagogical ends -- plus it's just a fascinating text.

> or  just say the title & pause very significantly?

Tony, I have sat here making up (or recalling) titles of the kind one might
pause very signifcantly after reading to an audience.

Heres a few : each will work better if you are faking a limp :

"Poem Before Jumping Off the Bungalow Roof"

"Fucking the Dean's Wife Upon Graduation"

"When I Cheated at Speed Chess in Washington Square"

"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"

"The Raven"

"I'm a Man of Few Words"

"I Swab the Decks Each Morning"

"Not Everybody Has a Small Tail"

"The Waste Land"

"Where the Water Runs Down to the Parson's Outhouse and Beyond"


--anyone else want to play?

Yes, I have witnessed many ways to deal with this obstacle of a title. Some
poets would sooner omit a title than deal with it. One I liked was reading
the title after the poem, but not before.

One other way to arrive at a title which I dont think you listed, is to
take the penultimate line. This is useful if you give a lot of readings, as
it signals the audience that youre about to stop.

 Then, after reading a number of these, read a long poem where the title is
repeated at the halfway mark.

You also write,
>It's not easy to make thematic titles when you dont have themes.

 This would be a good thing to preface a reading by remarking. Guaranteed
to put any audience at their ease.


David

While I have some sympathy with the ideas expressed by R Fleck and
forwarded to this list by A Sondheim, it seems to me the argument against
boycott is that depriving the Austrian people of work which promotes a
politics alternative to the politics that some few Austrians have elected
is counterproductive. If work has pretentions to USE (and i am not sure it
should!), then the place should be flooded with counter-right work,
stirring the populace to rise up and storm the Winter Palace.

There are a number of countries around the world where the work of writers
has encouraged/inspired the opposition to oppression (Catalunya under
Franco is one of which I am particularly aware). Should Austria be allowed
to fester in its new democratic rightwing stew (after all, coalitions are
part of the structure of a democratic system), or should we start an
airlift of suitably left poetry?

Who would a left boycott hurt? Those who want support, ideas, solidarity

Apologies for double posting.

Have to run, but I think the way that gender, class, educational level, etc.
plays itself out today in the alt poetry field would be fascinating to look
closely at.  The _Talisman_ anthology is, for instance, interesting for the
prevalence of writers with MFA degrees from the exp. writing programs.
Certainly a lot of networking is going on here, but how are these writers
different (in sociological terms) from the ones represented by, say, The Art
of Practice?  & what are the different *statuses* of its editors?  Why does
Ganick include a forward by Silliman?  Why isn't a similar forward included
--one by Eigner, say--in any of the Language anthologies?   Is the Talisman,
then, in terms of its presentational strategy more like the Language
anthologies, though less like them--less like Practice--in terms of content?
(while Practice is at the same time nothing like the Language anthologies in
the way it positions itself vis the status quo).  How similar is the poetry
of the former to the work done in more conventional MFA programs? Is there
the same kind of institutionalized transmission of aesthetic values?
Moreover, do the 3rd gen Language Poets (those represented roughly in
Practice) differ sociologically from the 1st gen Language Poets?   Assuming
that there is something more at stake here than merely aesthetic meritocracy
the questions
become fascinating to consider.

More complications:  whereas the recourse to *theory* was quite natural in a
way for the Language Poets to make, even among PhD poets such a recourse is
not nearly as easy or attractive today because this *position* is in a sense
still occupied by Bernstein, Silliman, etc.  So I think one finds a certain
backing away from theory going on & perhaps for this reason Beach is right
when he notices a "retreat" occuring in contemporary poetry.  I wouldn't
commit myself to any of this of course as it's only coming off the top of my
head.  But these questions--as innocuous as they seem to me---are apparently
*taboo*--and not merely *disputed*.  & that too raises interesting questions.

[This doesn't take into consideration much more than Jacques initial two
posts, so pardon me if it seems to ignore other commentary.  I wrote this a
few days ago.]

Hi Jacques,

I was intrigued by your post on Berrigan as are many others, obviously.
There are good ideas here but the language seems a bit off, overdetermined
in a way that ignores some of the "play" in the works of the figures you
cite.  I am not sure how this sentence operates:

> Success in poetry thus depends not as much on intrinsic abilities and
gifts (since aesthetic value is a social, not a natural, creation) as on the
extent of the poet's cultural capital--that is, his or her sense of the
state of the game as it being played *now*.

You make it sound like all poets have some sort of vision of the "game," a
game of critics, fans, canons, ideologies, etc, and that this game is
entirely one of acquring cultural, or symbolic, capital.  But then what of
the "game" that, say, William Carlos Williams played, which he played up to
the end when he asked (apparently, on his deathbed): "But will they last?"
He had obviously, I think, won the game you write of, which is to say he had
acquired some sort of position among the high canon of modernists, and had
visitors from all over the world paying homage to him, etc., and holding him
up against Eliot and an entire establishment of writers, but why doesn't
that satisfy him?  One could say (rather cynically, I think) that the
question concerned some sort of positioning in some immortal canon, but I
think there are more self-deceiving writers who are quite assured of their
position in this "immortal canon" who would not ask this question on their
deathbed (some of them appear in Bloom's book).  I tend to interpret this
question on a more basic level: he had made an investment in one particular
aspect of his own game, which is the reduction of his poems to typographical
creations, to words bashed out by an old whatever, Smith Corona, devoid, in
their most radical moments, of the sort of poly-referentiality and "deep"
meanings of Pound and Eliot and whatever the establishment represented,
devoid of homages to past forms, whether in terms of rhymes, meters,
stanzas, and he was not quite sure, at the end, whether he had played this
game quite rightly, whether it was a waste of time.  Which is to say, he
wanted to know if he had reinvented poetry (the guiding myth of the best
utopian poets), or had he merely disappeared down a dark sidestreet.
(Hopkins, I feel, was another, and so was Dickinson -- though I know you are
mostly concerned with modern/postmodern poetry, though I don't see quite the
break most people do between poetry production "then" and "now", except that
now we are all deluded into thinking that the most interesting writing is
making its appearance the day after it is written, and is not being stored
away in a trunk on account of the poet's modesty or sense of shame.)  So he
was probably asking not whether he had, himself, acquired symbolic or
cultural capital -- I think the awards, biographies and commentaries prove
he had -- but whether the poems had and can survive their immediate
context -- whether they will be "seminal" (not to get male-o-centric on
you), which is to me a more interesting, perhaps truthful, way of
approaching this issue.

[I'm probably taking "success" all wrong in your post, I realize.]

[Nonetheles...]

You probaby think I'm oversimplifying or romanticizing, but I think that we
can give poets (poets that we happen to admire or respect, with some
knowledge of their "lives") the benefit of the doubt when it comes to
perceiving wider dangers for their poems than can be described merely by
looking at the "public sphere", or the materialistically-determined sphere,
in which poetry is produced.  I think Anselm's post hits upon certain
aspects of this, especially as so much of TB's writing (though he appears to
have been a far-from-"modest" poet) seems not to have seen the light of day
(I mean outside the apartment), but contributed, at least in TB's mind, to
some image of the flux of his activity, hence, in a private canon which,
with its idiosyncrasies, virtues and blindnesses, is unreproducable for the
"market".  In this way the poet's private economy operates as a standing,
in-motion critique of the prevailing economy, since the "meanings" of
private symbols never become detached from their objects, though we as poets
always have to remind ourselves and, moreso, others that this private
economy exists, or existed, since, once the production appears -- the
Selected Poems of Ted Berrigan -- we are confronted with the "closed"
version of the poet's "career" -- the happy-ending version (snipped up as
The Sonnets in it are).

By the way, I saw Padgett read from the book you mention, and there are two
things to note: one, that TB may have been "very much concerned" with his
inclusion in the anthology, but that it doesn't really come across that way
in the book, as it was only noted in the course of a joke, when TB joked to
RP that he was _not_ in there,  which was very funny when Padgett read it
(he used a sort of "Me Tarzan You Jane" kind of voice), and two, that RP
didn't seem to much care about not being included, as he doesn't seem to
care much for "symbolic capital" though he is, as far as I'm concerned, a
terribly underrated, sometimes very ambitious, and in the end fine poet
(kind of like Herrick, a poet who seemed a bit "old-fashioned" once people
finally recognized he was there, but whose civil, almost hedonistic
temperement has more or less kept him on course, terribly unanxious as he
was for popular approval).  In fact, I ran into RP at a book party for some
journal he wrote of, I think, Sweden, and he told me not to buy the book,
saying simply: "It sucks."  I don't think he was waiting for me to argue
with him, that he was treating me like an adoring acolyte, but that it was
his "modesty" (and Tulsa humor); in any case I didn't experience any sort of
clash of symbolic capital there, nor even a clash of discourses -- I got the
joke, took the advice, moved on.  In any case, RP is a counter-example to
the image of the poet you present, and though you may argue that he has a
small circle of admirers in which he is respected and among whom he
possesses "cultural capital", one would have to ask, then, what he has to
done to expand this capital, since it seems that one would, in an effort to
get over anxieties of _losing_ this capital, one would seek expansion -- new
markets, younger, better-looking, wealthier.

My sense is that many of these arguments which use basic figures of poets as
their examples often use figures that are most aggressive in asserting
discourses as the sort of Everyman, reading a Barrett Watten beneath the
skin of a Ted Berrigan, for example.  When you write that:

> What was also largely at stake here was the inevitable dialectic of change
that constitutes the shifting hierarchical structure of the cultural field
(in other words, the breakdown in communications was *not* some unfortunate
misunderstanding but was intended as a direct challenge to the cultural
practice in which Berrigan had accumulated symbolic capital.  Since ideas
were taken somewhat more seriously at this time, the poetry world wasn't
able to accomodate the legitimacy of both the Lang Poets and the 2nd gen
NYS.  Again, the discourse of " poetic community" entirely conceals what was
essentialy a conflict of power).

While I don't want to imagine TB as some sort of divine innocent here, and I
don't know much about this exchange, I think there are a few things to note.
I think the use of the term "poetry world" here is not very helpful -- who
are what is the "poetry world" and how did this world demonstrate any
inability to accomodate these dual legitimacies?  Did the poetry world fail
to accomodate the legitimacy of the original "New York School" and the
"projectivist school", and the "Beats"?  All three of these groups have more
definitive contours than the 2nd generation New York School poets, and
certainly more "cultural capital" and contrasts in values, and the Language
Poets, at that time, were kind of just starting out (which I mention since I
wonder if the Language poets were in the position of _creating_ a discourse
for their predecessors which they could then critique and overturn, since
one wonders how oppressive this prior discourse, or rather cultural economy,
really was -- wasn't there a larger, more oppressive cultural economy?).  In
any case, what kind of opposition, in terms of discourse, did TB really
propose, except perhaps to claim that he didn't understand what the Language
Poets were talking about, or didn't care for this sort of ideological
thinking (carrying over the "Fuck Communism" from the Bean Spasms, which he
probably didn't "mean" in an ideological or normative way, over to this part
of his life, a phrase, by the way, that seems to prefigure in its
graffiti-like brevity and overstatement the even shorter "I HATE SPEECH" of
Grenier).  While I would agree with you that TB was probably blind to the
play of these cultural institutions on himself and his work, or at least
rarely thought about it, and hence would react to defend this level of
culture in which he felt comfortable, one would have to ask why his writing
and life seems so "fragmented" and small-pub based as it was. Wasn't there
as much money in his "art world" as there was in that of O'Hara and Ashbery?
I also don't understand, based on you paragraph above, how a "breakdown in
communications" could serve as a "direct challenge" -- is this a transplant
of the Dadaist gesture to the realm of cultural discourse, so that we are
questioning discourses ability to determine anything by throwing static in
its path?  Is one able to create a productive discourse at the same time as
enacting a "breakdown of communications" -- and did the Language Poets
really do this?  I agree with you that the term "poetic community" means
almost nothing, but once you do away with this "poetic community" as a
category, you realize that those who were once considered actors on this
stage are really subject to much greater forces that extend beyond it, which
is to say that you can't (to get metaphorical on you) usefully isolate the
different currents of air work in a limited space, say in a bedroom or
cafeteria, and hope to explain how hurricanes and typhoons operate -- there
are connections, but one must keep things in perspective.

> The reason the List carries so many mentions of the Lang Poets is an
extremely ironic one:  They stand in the way of the next generation, but, as
cultural values themselves don't matter really anymore (not as much as
symbolic capital does) the next generation cannot dispense w/ the Language
poets function to confer legitimization.

I'm not so sure this is true, and I'll use, for lack of more knowledge,
myself as a counter-example.  I was recently visited by two Canadian
concrete poets, Darren Wershler-Henry and Christian Bok, and they have been
very supportive of my web work, as has Kenneth Goldsmith, not himself a
"language poet" but a visual artist.  Steve McCaffery, associated with the
Language poets (though excluded from In The American Tree) and a friend of
Christians, doesn't actually, so I hear, think much of some of his work,
maybe even lots of it -- regardless, he carries on, and my sense of Toronto
is that it is quite vital in terms of exchanging ideas and charting out
possibilities for poetry (oddly, all the writers seem to attend the same
parties there, whether they are selling screenplays or basing poems on the
sounds of electric razors).  I am also in contact with Keston Sutherland and
Andrea Brady, presently in Cambridge, UK, where the LangPos hold no sway,
and yet they carry on with their own various senses of tradition, along with
the Asian American scene in New York (and in L.A., ie. Walter Lew), though
only rather peripherally.  Another strand would be "cyberpoets", and as yet
inchoate set of circumstances as far as I can tell.  Most of the poets who
have recently come to New York, most of whom are 5 or so years younger than
me, have far less anxiety about this group of poets than those poets
slightly older than me (to be general and reductive).  My point being,
simply, that there is quite a lot out there that is free of this Language
poetry orbit, and that one can submerge oneself in these various vectors
without any sort of idea of the Language poets "conferring legitimization"
(where is this done anyway?).  I think the problem is more concerning where
the next level of "discourse" about poetry is to emerge, where find these
terms, how to make them vital, etc., without succumbing to a sort of
tit-for-tat with the wide-ranging critique and discourse provided by these
poets.  But if you choose to sacrifice the need for this discourse (I called
them "ideas" in other posts, and I obviously argue that this discourse and
these ideas are useful) then one can do fine (sort of).

> Emerging poets are thus caught in the double bind evident in the Talisman
anthology.

I'd like to know what this double-bind is, since I couldn't make much out of
that book myself.  I thought the anthology rather premature as an
"anthology" and, as a result, very awkward, providing a not-very clear
window on some developing but as yet inchoate poetic activity (it would have
been a good special issue of the magazine, but it provided no punctuation to
the course of poetry).  The poetry being written right now is much more
interesting than what was being done back then, not so long ago, though I
don't know how much credit could be given to that book for spurring this
activity.  Anyway, do you really feel caught in a "double bind" that is
presented in that book?

Anyway, just some ideas -- hopeless ramble.  Took the day off of work today
(had an "upset stomach").

Best,
Brian

Just a quick not in response to Ellis's recent post, where he asks:

> Are we to presume that respect for one's private authority take the place
of that authority's expression in the public domain of language?

Without going into the entire paragraph, which seems to me to present a very
confused argument, I think in a nutshell that I would answer Yes to this
one, provided one changes the term "private authority" to "sense of personal
determinacy," which is to say that I think the personal contracts that
people generally honor amongst each other are to be held in higher regard
than any sort of abstraction concerning the "public domain of language,"
whatever that is, simply because we all have a "right" to feel in control of
our actions, even if these actions are somehow sublimated to the level of
"cultural productions."  Another way of putting it: those of us who post to
the list trust that our "actions" in this event, the creation of language,
is going to be read in the context of a "thread" and we expect any
interpretiave glosses to be provided with the consideration of this context,
which is a matter of trust (more than "right") -- it would be cynical to
sacrifice this trust to the cause of some idea of the "public domain of
language" (basic to this understanding is the idea that "writing," like
shouting "kill the motherfuckers"* at a football match or weeping hot tears
in a movie theatre and commenting on it afterwards are all forms of "action"
that can be later recalled and commodified, and if this seems ridiculous
because I am not citing aspects of "literary" activity, think of how
unliterary most of our posts are compared to, say, The Ambassadors or
Finnegans Wake -- we are basically writing fortune cookies.)  Most of us
gladly give up the right to, say, the quotations of one of our poems in a
review, as we basically understand that this is what happens to poems -- no
appeal to universals is made -- but to, say, publish the poem in a book or
magazine in a context in which it is supporting some cause that is
repulsive, then any issue of the "public domain of language" falls
immediately to the side.  I don't even think people should take posts from
this list and publish them elsewhere -- as has been done to one of my own
posts, without "permission" (a post I had regretted writing in the way I
did) -- since it separates the text from the situation in which it was
proposed, or for which it was produced (though in fact I have guiltily
republished prior posts to the list, which I have mixed feelings about
having done).  That, as Ellis writes, concerning posting one of Jacques
"retracted" posts to the list, "[a] sort of offense can be generative as
well as merely offensive," he is of course right, there can be a generative
apsect to any sort of literary terrorism -- by this I mean those acts that
step outside of the contracts that writers/editors have among each other,
even if one has decided these contracts are stultifying -- but then why
justify it with these sorts of arguments that aspire to absolute
determinations of what is "public" and "private" -- why not simply say he
broke a law, and suffer gladly for it (and risk a friendship, I would
presume).

week, concerning mostly how indecent the New York fans were to him when he

I myself am not so sure that the Language poets changed everything. But I
think that charges leveled generally at "academic professionalism" (as
opposed to its specific practices) perform the fear of professionalism more
than they criticize it.

Any infiltrator of the academy witnesses first-hand the shame and anxiety of
professional literary critics (by which I mean: those who believe they
aren't poets). They don't need creative writers to tell them that they're
alienated: they already know it. This is bad energy that can be turned to
one's own (and more than one's own) advantage.

Okay title fans.  When you're looking at paintings do you look at the
little card first?  in the middle? at the end?  not at all?  Does it matter
that Vermeer named a painting "The Art of Painting" (very spectacular,
currently on loan at the National Gallery)?  That we know this title from a
document (letter or bankruptcy claim or bill of sale, I don't recall) by
his wife after his death?  Where does the title fit?  How does it function?

Everyone seems to perceive time as one-dimensional (whether in a straight
line or wave-like or circular or...) but in special relativity it has a
sort of smeary two-dimensional quality, i.e., the separation between events
is time-like or space-like depending on whether a certain quantity is
positive or negative (I know all this is taking place in 4-D, but I'm
collapsing space into 1-D for the sake of imagery).  Does anyone perceive
things that way?

jacques debrot,

Well of course you didn't ask why write poetry.  I felt/feel the question
was implicated not by *your* arguments, per se, but by the larger
conversation.  Your arguments reduce poetic practice to its most utilitarian
dimension.  That that utilitarian dimension exists is not something I take
issue with; to infer that that's *all* there is (or all there is that's
worth discussing, lest we betray our biases as "individual agents") as you
so coldly do, *is* precisely the matter of dispute.  The question of why
write poetry is not meant to elicit anecdotal responses, as you seem to
suggest ("i'm sure there are many
different reasons for writing poetry"), but rather is intended to implicate
the meaning of poetic practise.  Let me recast the issue in terms which
perhaps you can better understand.  If poetic practice is ultimately
reducible to the quest for cultural capital, then poets, *statistically
speaking*, write in order to accumulate same, & those who are smarter, who
have better calculated their self-interest, are not unaware of this fact.
Indeed, the attempt to accumulate cultural capital could be said-- as I
believe you *are* saying-- to determine the character of poetic production.
Cultural capital would be the ultimate goal of poetic production, one of
which individual agents may not be entirely unaware, and all poetic
production would be reducible to the attempt to accumulate it.  This, I
would argue, is analogous to saying that the *meaning* of poetic production
is the attempt to accumulate cultural capital.  (Please understand, I don't
mean the "meaning" of individual poems, though in fact I see no reason why
this overriding concern should not ultimately be deducible on the thematic,
or at least the symbolic level, & can only imagine the many new "readings"
of classic literary texts which might result from this insight)....

I would argue that the meaning of poetic practice coincides with, but IS NOT
IDENTICAL TO, the question of why write.  In that sense, the latter is
ultimately subject to a more anecdotal understanding; & some people do write
in part for reasons that are not far removed from your analysis.  Yet the
two are close in other ways, and for many writers, arguably identical.
(Imagine Shelley's or Brecht's or Oppen's or Silliman's work divorced from
its political purpose).

"i don't think that what bourdieu is interested in is the poet's
*intentions* per se--just that, if one is going to present a model of a
social practice, intentions, motives, self-interest and so on are some of
the things agents do act on.  but in fact these things are finally what is
indeterminable in his analysis."

It is true that we are ultimately unaware of the implications of our
actions.  These matters are bound by culture, gender, class, race, as well
as our necessarily limited purview as "individual agents."  The point is
that we have to proceed with as much awareness of these circumstances as
possible-- that's where theory comes in.  But you seem to evade my point
that there has to be more, that a meaning is implicated in cultural
activity, out of which the question of why write, if indeterminable
(unquantifyable?), is exactly what is at stake.  Your argument sideswipes
poetic meaning in favor of the mechanizations of cultural power.

& By the way, I do not care about your reading of Bourdieu.  Yes,
acknowledge where you got your ideas.  But this isn't a seminar, Jacques.
I'm talking to YOU.  What do you have to say,

Mark DuCharme

Subject:      titles and experiments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Couldn't the title be a poem in itself? I came up with a brilliant title
for a poem, "Minor Poets of the New York School," but I couldn't possibly
write the poem itself since it would inevitably be disappointing. How
about a book of titles with no poems? The reader would have to supply the
poem to match each title. I like titles that have an oblique or mysterious
relation to the poem, especially those by Wallace Stevens and John
Ashbery. I've been trying to write a poem called "Conventionally good
poem" for several months:  the idea was to announce in the title that the
poem was attempting to be a "good" poem, with lots of stunning imagery,
vivid language, moving emotional effects, etc... Of course this title is
the perfect invitation to writer's block.

I've seen untitled poems printed (or usually RE-printed) incorrectly.
Squished together with the preceding poem or following poem or with half
the poem missing. It seems then that the title has some role in preserving
the integrity of the text against well-meaning or malicious  anthologists.


My writing experiments are posted at the poetry project web-sit
(www.poetryproject.com/html.mayhew). Others are buried in the poetics
archives (1998 I believe). They are frankly and apologetically derivative
of Bernadette Mayer and OuLiPo.

love the question ---- love trying to do so ----- but dont have much faith
that i have ----- some months back bill lavender asked me if i cd think of a
way of conceiving of time that didnt use spacial metaphors ----- more head
scratching

i only write to mention again a book i've been reading about time which
might interests judy, bill, dan waber, other folks adding to this thread or
thinking about it maybe in cozy bean bag chairs of lurkdom

_time's arrow and archimedes point_
        by huw price
it's very interesting and has given me some pretty wild flights of thinking
about time ---- mainly trying to get my head around the idea that the "arrow
of time" the perceived directionality of it (it goes thatta way) is a
consequence of our being located within time ---- price suggests,
heuristically, an archimedean point outside time, from which perspective
causality for instance wd be seen to work in *both* directions

which i find endlessly fun to think about ----- tho i mentioned it at a
meeting sometime back and was told it wasnt very interesting and that it wd
be more interesting if time went off on many tangents instead of operating
"on a line" ----- still, i find the notion of causality being reversible
more complicated than say, seeing a film running backwards

anyway, some thoughts

Is it not obvious that this is a (very subjective) opinion? I do not agree
at
all that the titles in visual art are 'meaning'less. I am a visual artist
and
my titles are of immense importance to me and, I hope, to the work. It is a
different language (obviously) and one which I enjoy hinging upon the power
of.  Visual language, especially abstract, is also less 'readable' to most
and
a title can sometimes assist in 'grounding' a work to a viewer without a
reference point. The titles are often referential, symbolic -- telling in an
obscure, poetic or obvious manner (depending on meaning / effect / intent)
and
adding a dimension which I find quite vital in both creating and
experiencing
(visual and otherwise) art.  My opinion and/or actions are the same when it
comes to poetry -- the titles always come after the completion of the piece
and
are often simply one word which references the aura, as it were, of the poem
in
total.  They are often hints, suggestive and/or misleading, openings,
invitations plumbing the semiological depths ... (please note: all expressed
with the sensibilities a of drama queen who loves the word; and, of course,
a
subtle sense of humour in tow.)

and: in a lot of visual art created in the last 10 years especially, you
will
note the predominance of text (or implied text) -- it's means/media sought
by
many an artist to describe/accentuate the indelibility of the 'trace,' the
'mark ...'

KOMNINOS ZERVOS
Since 1985 i have been a professional performance poet, touring around
australia performing at schools, literary festivals, and community
groups. on one such tour of north western new south wales (what we call
the outback) i began to make cyberpoetry on my mac powerbook 100 with
4meg of ram and a "huge" 40mb hard disk. i created lists of adjectives,
nouns,verbs,adjectives,nouns, in a spreadsheet program and then used the
random sort to create new combinations, like the exquisite corpse poems
of the surrealiats. i also made my first text animation using five
microsoft works 2 draw files, all of the word "fall" at different
positions down a page, so when i ran it in slide show mode the word fall
appeared to be falling down the page - very cliche!

I am teaching mostly these days, and writing my phd in english on "the
performance of poetry in australia since 1945". i occassionally scribble
a personal, diary entry type poem, but mainly i am hinking of creating
for cyberspace these days. in cyberpoetry the only rule is poetry that
can't be published in the print medium, that relies on the properties of
the computer, the internet and the world wide web.

DIRECTIONS TO MILLS FROM SAN FRANCISCO &/or BERKELEY:

 From the Bay Bridge area, take 580 East toward Hayward. A few miles
down the pike, you'll pass exits for 35th Ave, Fruitvale Ave., and High
Street. Take the MacArthur Blvd. exit, which comes immediately after High
Street. When you get to the bottom of the exit ramp you will be facing
Mills College. Take a right onto MacArthur off the ramp and a quick left
into the Mills Entrance. The guard at the gate can direct you from there,
but it's relatively easy. The road you're on ends at a T intersection.
Park anywhere you can and retrace your steps to this intersection. If you
go forward from here (as if the road continued) you'll pass the library
and cross a small bridge. The next building on the left is the student
center. From where you stand, the Faculty Lounge is at the back left
corner of the building. If you have questions feel free to call Mills
Information at 510-430-2255 or leave a message for Elizabeth Willis at
510-430-2289.


PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FROM SAN FRANCISCO

Mills College is easily accessible by bus.  Catch the N bus at the
Transbay Terminal (Mission & 1st) and in half an hour it lets you off
across the street from Mills.  If you've never been to Mills, ask the
driver to tell you where to get off.  It costs $2.50 each way.

Sadly _Dictee_ appears to be completely out of print, thus unavailable to
the professors and civilians who (fairly frequently) contact SPD looking
for it.  Third Woman Press, its original publisher, has had plans to
reprint it for some time, but it continues not to arrive at our doorstep.
Hopefully the reprint is still in the works, as it's an excellent and
suggestive work.

I speak as one who spent his errant youth wanting to be a
theoretical physicist, and who studied that subject at both under-
and graduate level.  I don't care if the author has a sinecure at
the Institute for Advanced Satiety--these are the chaps who
gave us thermonuclear weapons.  This should be remembered
by starry-eyed dharma bums with visions of 'verbal' quanta
dancing like sugar-plums.

The serious philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics
is about as vexed, contentious, indeterminate and aporetic
as the interpretation of Jeremy Prynne.  But it requires a *lot*
more technical study.  Quantum mechanics is a very impressive
intellectual achievement and also has its aesthetic attractions
(as a formalism, independent of specious interpretations), but
it shouldn't be regarded as human nature's last word on nature.
Nor should the babblings of professional scientists who
happen to lend support to our own philosophical wishful
thinking be taken very seriously.

(And I'm as big an admirer of Pound's poetry as there is,
but I think he was off-base in his Fenellosian semantics.)

        LONG POST

        responds to various backchannel queries re antin's references to
poetry/prose in the previous "Language Art" posting
        consists primarily of a lengthy quote from david antin
        antin discusses and quotes from gertrude stein, and
        makes his case for poetry and prose not being "on the same plane"



        { p o e t i x }



since my post "the Language Art" appeared in this forum i've received a
number of backchannel messages about it, and as the majority of questions
seem to revolve around the things that david says in the passages i quoted
wrt poetry/prose, i thought to transcribe some other comments that he makes
in that same article which bear on the questions asked of me ---- i havent
taken the time to respond to all of you individually so if what follows
doesnt clarify things for you, or if i have overlooked something please let
me know ---- on the list even unless you really think that no one else wd be
interested

at the point where i cut in david is considering why it is that it took so
long for stein's work to be dealt with adequately

begin quote________

        I'm not really sure why, though I think it was partly because of the
genre problem, the question of what it was she was writing. You have to
remember that at that time most of the American poetry avant-garde made a
big thing of the distinction between "poetry" and "prose" and that Stein
started out as a writer of narrative fiction, or at least she presented her
early work in the context of the "story" and the "novel", which were
generally considered "prose" forms.  But by 1908 and 1909 she had embarked
on a career that could not be defined in terms of "fiction".  _Three Lives_
may superficially resemble the story genre, and she evokes a deliberate
comparison with Flaubert; but her three "stories" are much less stories than
the pieces in _Dubliners_ and much more language constructions. And if this
is true at all for _Three Lives_, it became more and more true for _The
Making of Americans_, and was quite clear in the portraits like _Ada_ or
"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene" that what you had were language constructions
not stories. Yet they were presented in a "prose" format---with capital
letters beginning what look like sentences, periods closing them and
periodic paragraphing. I've said it before, but I think it's worth saying
again: prose is a kind of concrete poetry with justified margins. It is
essentially characterized by the conventions of printing and the images of
grammar and logic and order to which they give rise.  But whatever it looks
like, a characteristic passage from "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene" is poetry in
any intelligent sense of the word:

"There were some dark and heavy men there then. There were some who were not
so heavy and some who were not so dark. Helene Furr and Georgine Skeene sat
regularly with them. They sat regularly with the ones who were dark and
heavy. They sat regularly with the ones who were not so dark. They sat
regularly with the ones who were not so heavy. They sat with them regularly,
sat with some of them. They went with them regularly, went with them. They
were regular then, they were gay then, they were where they wanted to be
then where it was gay to be then, they were regularly gay then..."

This is a traditional phrase poetry in spite of the illusion of punctuation,
with its seemingly orthodox commas and periods, that at times seem almost
appropriate, but then become as irrelevant as flyspecks randomly distributed
over a musical score. Stein's language is as difficult to contain within the
page punctuation conventions of "prose" as _Beowolf_ or the _Iliad_, which
were maddeningly punctuated even in scholarly editions. But these same
scholarly editions are quite careful to present the line breaks that will
assure you you are looking at "verse," which is not the same thing as
"poetry" but almost the same thing for most people. Still there's no reason
why Stein's prose punctuation should fool a poet, even though the prose
costume probably contributed to the mistaken expectations for a certain type
of narrative presentation that were from then on usually disappointed.    (
. . . )    Still, the poetry of the portraits resembled sufficiently a
poetry of incantations and litanies that, for a poet with as sensitive an
ear and as generous sensibilities as Pound, was not really a problem. After
all he recognized at least three different kinds of melopoeia, including the
litany, and was willing to assume others as yet unknown to him (". . . and
with the subject never really out of my mind I don't yet know half there is
to know about melopoeia"). Pound may have been provincial, be he wasn't
really an academic; or if he was an academic, he was academic in the only
sense that ever gave a positive meaning to the word. I don't think the
novelty of her work gave Williams any problems either but that's where the
sympathy ended---with the Pound-Williams modernists. But even there the
interest of her work was narrowly conceived, partly because these poets were
surprisingly involved in the poetry/prose distinction, as most American
poets seems to have been for the next fifty years. While the problem seems
relatively trivial now with the 60s in back of us, it's easy to see that the
meaning of poetry itself seemed to be at stake in the question thrown at all
modernist poetry: "what separates it from prose?"  Generally the poets who
got into the argument took one of two tacks. They either made a problematic
distinction between "poetry" and "prose," like Pound, or else, like Eliot,
they made an apparently banal distinction between "verse" and "prose" and as
far as possible declined the gambit of what "poetry" was.  But Eliot, who
was assuming what looked like an antimodernist position in his criticism,
could afford to do this more easily than Pound or Williams, self-declared
modernists, who had an obligation to define the scope of operations and the
unique medium of "poetry," a term they were unwilling to surrender.  The
problem is an old one and the issues develop in the West along torturous
lines filled with traps, sacrifices, tempo shifts and recoveries, all
precipitated by the opening, which when handled by players of great sill on
both sides of the questions leads to no significant outcome because the
insolubility of the problem is built into the opening. The basic idea out of
which the question opens is what seems like a commonsense observation: that
poetry as usually practiced is different from ordinary discourse; the next
two moves are to identify all ordinary language use as ordinary discourse
and then to identify ordinary discourse as "prose"; from there on the game
is predetermined except for blunders. The point is that it's worthwhile to
question every single one of those assumptions. Even the first assumption,
what is it? That poetry is different because it has a funny sound, a funny
way of talking, and a funny way of thinking? Which is to say, it is
distinguished by an arbitrary, conventional, overstructured phonological
arrangement (if you like Jacobsonian formalism); and by eccentricities of
syntax and eccentricities of semantic structure or mode of representation
(figures of speech and figures of thought, if you like classical rhetorical
notions). But "distinguished" from what? ordinary talk?  It's possible to
attack the whole notion of "ordinary talk" and watch it crumble, and that's
my way, to assault the whole gambit ...

Tom,

Thanks for your thoughtful post.  Your account of Bourdieu is useful, &
there's nothing in it I take issue with.  What I objected to is the sense, I
found in Jacques' post, that poetic production can be reduced to a
Bourdieuvian dynamic.  Certainly I didn't & wouldn't disagree that such a
dynamic is *one* of the factors at play-- a distinction which I think you've
articulated very well. Clearly, "the poet who writes with no preconceived
sense of poetic value and sends out work... entirely indiscriminately" IS
naive!  (& I didn't recognize what you meant by naive in your earlier post,
so I'm glad you clarified).  I don't even think it matters particularly the
extent to which Bourdieu is "helpful" to poets-- not all theory has to be of
direct use to practioners-- so long as in discussing him we make clear, as
you do, the limits of his use.  & You're right that the distinction between
oppositonal & "academic/mainstream"-- in the Bourdieuvian sense!-- is
becoming a little more fuzzy.  I would only point out that this comes in the
wake of over a century of "experimental/alternative" poetic activity,
through which many practioners blew their chance at immediate cultural
capital, so to speak, through a commitment to larger principles of
engagement.

Congratulations to Ralph LaCharity's 86th issue of Worcs Aloud/Allowed.
The quick and comprehensive collection of writers says much of
LaCharity's work as a editor & poet over the years. This Ed Dorn issue
gives many views that will probably not appear in subsequent homages to
the poet. As a reader and contributor, I'll mention a few:

The breadth of the material makes clear Dorn's range of impact in Ohio
from his years as a teacher at Kent & Bowling Green to colleagues,
students & students of his students. Not to say other areas are not
represented, but I doubt future editors will take the time, or publish
the people needed, to make this connection. Many fine remembrances were
forwarded from mention of The Gathering in summer of 1997, a joyous
multi-day reading in Portsmouth OH at Brian's house, which included,
from my memory, nine of the folks in the issue plus many others.

Letters, poems, & essays by Brian Richards, Charlie Potts, Gary David,
Bill Levy, Skip Fox, Ray Obermayr, Linda & Ralph LaCharity, Stephen
Ellis, Norm Ballinger, Paul Nelson, Richard Blevins, Joel Lipman, Jim
Palmarini, Joe Napora, Joe Sadfie, Kurt Hemmer, Major Ragain, David
Baratier, Dale Smith, Richard Silberg, Tom Raworth, Jeremy Prynne, Tom
Clark, Robert Kelly, Bob Kaufman, Richard Loranger, Anne Marie--

For me, Rich Blevin's "December Rain" (first 6 lines here) is a fine
piece--

The news is in forever
all the many-mouthed agents for the singular moment
essay on tongue
appropriated for the occassion
from the poet's estate, usufruct,
in the days when the history of futures is fallen out of print

& Brian Richards "Some Love Poems" has been read over and again since
rec. Monday, a week ago.

If he is willing to sell issues, there is only 100, try an sase of query
to: POB 27309, Cincinnati, OH 45227. I mention it here, so someone years
from now can know of it's existence.

Be well

Tony,

Apologies, again, for my uncivil tone b/c.  de Duve is certainly relevant.
The threat that looms over _Kant After Duchamp_ is the possibility that,
following from Duchamp's readymades, there might come a time when a blank
canvas would be considered an entirely persuasive work of art.  It has been a
few years since I read the de Duve, and I did not have Bourdieu in mind then,
so it is difficult for me to say now whether de Duve recuperates Bourdieu, or
whether one might consider his work a supplement to Bourdieu's, but I do
intend to read _Kant After Duchamp_ again.  It's a wonderful suggestion.

You write:  "However, anyone who has ever studied the arts closely will know
that

to substantiate any judgements there is an elaborate & complex preliminary

phase of working.  In most critical processes one would suppose a very close

attention to how the medium is worked, how it engages a reading with its

representations & how it engages with its interrogations & uses &

discoveries in & of the medium.  This may take a long time -- & in that time

the Subject  is submitting itself to the enigmatic & hitherto unknown

otherness of the poem or picture - whatever -- being looked into."

First, this is certainly right, but I don't think it is inconsistent with my
position.  It describes both 1.  the acquistion of cultural capital--by which
I mean the appreciation for or competence in deciphering the code in which
cultural artifacts have been encrypted, and 2.  the habitus --or feeling for
the game--that disposes agents to certain perceptions and practices and not
to others.

But the dilemna de Duve lays out & which is most relevant to Bourdieu is, in
part, this:
How does a urinal, say, or a shovel, or coat rack become, simply through the
artist's nomination, a work of art?  Or 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence?
Or a single word (for instance Aram Saroyan's one word poems)?  Bourdieu
would say by an act of *magic* subtended by a whole tradition leading up to
these gestures & legitimized by a *belief* in the charismatic ideology
celebrated by that tradition.  Thus, Duchamp's sacreligious nomination of a
urinal as a work of art, in becoming consecrated in the 1960s through the
struggles for symbolic capital & the objective relations internal to the
field of art, provided the basis for a new belief injected with "meaning and
value by commentary and commentary on commentary."  Rather than being an
exception, the readymade exposes the illusion of artistic value as a
collective misrepresentation.

Mark D.,

Actually, I would be glad if my posts made writing more, not less difficult,
and the reasons for writing less and less apparent.  Writing poems has
already become something which is much too *easy* to do--one of the unspoken
scandals of alternative poetry.  (And, just so this is not misinterpreted,
let me quickly add Mark that I read your poems w/ a lot of pleasure.)

While you're right, I do come off a little like someone giving a seminar,
your insisting on what *I* think hints at (while most of the criticisms of my
positions here plainly show) how pervasive romantic and essentialist
ideologies are in the alt poetry world--& it's not that people are
overwhelmingly unconvinced by me (that is, it's not necessarily that I think
I'm *right*), rather it's the *reasons* given by so many (not all) for their
disagreement w/ me that I find enormously revealing.  (Revealing, not in the
sense that I necessarily want to stigmatize these ideologies either, but that
they are inconsistent w/ whatever fantasy these people have about themselves
in relation to *innovation*--where innovation is understood by *them* to be a
positive term.)   It isd a house of cards.  Far from being distinct from the
mainstream, the  ideology of much contemporary experimental poetry seems to
be underlied by a largely essentialist view of poetic talent (but w/out,
contradictorily, any reliance on aesthetic standards and values--this is
precisely what is suppressed by our "inclusiveness", matched in the wider
culture by the bad-faith of pluralism--see Hal Foster) and thus legitimized
*only* by our own version of the cult of celebrity.   (Not to be
misunderstood, I am not criticizing the lack of standards.  Rather, standards
are what the logic of an essentialist position demands & I am just pointing
this out.)

I would be behaving in bad-faith if I were at this point to continue and give
anyone reasons for writing poetry.  Nor am I the slightest bit interested in
reforming the poetry world or writing ridiculous (& ironic I hope)
manifestos.  Again, for now, I am wondering, for myself (as I do write
"poems") *how* to write inside this impossible space I've laid out, not yet
*why*.

Hi Brian,

I've just answered 2 other posts & I feel my energy flagging, so let me just
scratch the surface of your note, saving the best parts (Berrigan et al) for
another day.  (Btw I just read maybe the most revealing interview about 70s
poetry--a conversation between Mike Magee & Bill Berkson--in COMBO magazine
which I know you have at hand Brian as you have some great poems there as
well.)

Let me start, though, by telling you that I began graduate school
specializing in the Victorian novel, so I am quite familiar w/ the thoroughly
conventionalized protocol of death bed scenes which reach their apotheosis
during this period.  & "last words" are also a kind of sub genre, aren't
they?  Everyone knows Goethe's "More Light," & my favorite--Mishima's suicide
note--"Life is short, but I would like to live forever."  These are part &
parcel of the legitimizing traditions of belief in the consecrated artist.
Nor, do I doubt WCW's sincerity--sincerity is, as Bourdieu says, "one of the
preconditions of symbolic efficacy."  But part of what we miss in retrospect,
when looking back at a poet's career, is a feel for the habitus, how
precisely & for what stakes, & in what context, did the poet play the game.

You write about WCW, "he had made an investment in one particular

aspect of his own game, which is the reduction of his poems to typographical

creations, to words bashed out by an old whatever, Smith Corona, devoid, in

their most radical moments, of the sort of poly-referentiality and "deep"

meanings of Pound and Eliot and whatever the establishment represented,

devoid of homages to past forms, whether in terms of rhymes, meters,

stanzas . . ."

Well, yes, but while all of this is, again, not at all inconsistent w/ my
earlier posts, I'm not going to go there this time.  Instead, inasmuch as you
can get perhaps an even better sense of how a poet plays the game through the
context in which he/she promotes the work of friends--though this is what is
*lost* over time because its seen as inconsequential--I thought it would be
interesting to paste to this post a sample of some excreably conventional
work carried in OTHERS (which a friend passed on to me)

Maxwell Bodenheim, for example, was a constant presence in the magazine:

I shall turn and feel upon my feet
The kisses of Death, like scented rain."

This is an entirely typical couplet, my friend tells me.  Schofield Thayer
was another completely banal & thoroughly trite writer.  But, now, Wallace
Gould is in a league of his own:

"Sing, nigger in the distance. coming up the hill.
Sing to the broom, the watermelon, the wind, the moon, the paradise of
    niggers, the god of niggers..."

Oh my God!  I don't have time to make more of this, if in fact *anything* can
be made of it, except to say that it's the neglected, forgotten, trivial
aspects of a poet's career--WCW certainly knew these poems were awful--just
as much as the sublimated aspects, that constitute the habitus.

Will the Greatest Story Ever Told Be From a Computer? ---
Brutus Program Crafts Tales Of Deceit and Betrayal;
Don't Call It Literature

Wall Street Journal, February 7, 2000

TROY, N.Y. (AP)

Brutus creates stories about lies, self-deception and acts of betrayal.

There is no dark muse inspiring Brutus, though. No torturous plumbing of the
writer's soul.

Brutus is, after all, a computer blueprint.

The program based on the blueprint, Brutus.1, can write stories because its
creators have condensed the complexities of deceit and double-crosses into
mathematical equations it can understand. Characters and facts of the story
are fed into Brutus.1, and out comes 500-word tales that read very much like
human prose.

"Dave Striver loved the university," Brutus.1 begins one tale. "He loved the
ivy-covered clock towers, its ancient and sturdy brick and its sun-splashed
verdant greens and eager youth."

The prose isn't exactly the caliber of E. Annie Proulx, or even Danielle
Steel. But in an age when computers can already read, talk and beat chess
champions, Brutus.1's small literary success raises a big question: Can
computers write good stories?

"I get e-mails from terrified people," says Brutus's co-creator Selmer
Bringsjord, director of the Minds and Machines Lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.

Researchers such as Mr. Bringsjord have been trying to get machines to write
like humans for decades, with mixed success. In the 1970s, a pioneering
storytelling machine spun simplistic tales like "Once upon a time John Bear
lived in a cave. John knew that John was in his cave . . ."

Brutus.1, in comparison, can write much more sophisticated prose. But after
seven years of development, Brutus.1 remains a limited writer. It only
produces stories in the 500-word range. The only setting it describes is
academia.

And Brutus.1, named for the famous conspirator against Caesar, only can
write about betrayal and related acts. That is partly due to the creators'
preferences. Mr. Bringsjord notes the dark side can be more fascinating. But
there is another important reason: Brutus.1 doesn't understand love.

If you go to the good side of things, you have to figure out love, and we
have no idea how to do that, Mr. Bringsjord said.

Betrayal, on the other hand, was something Mr. Bringsjord and co-creator
David Ferrucci of International Business Machine's T.J. Watson Research
Center felt they could reduce to mathematical formulas.

In Brutus.1's world, the act of hoodwinking is expressed in part like this:
"X betrays Y if and only if there is something Z that Y wants." Characters
progress through a series of these formulas like pinballs, creating the
narrative. Little tweaks of the formula change where the story goes.

The story comes out looking like proper English because Brutus.1 has been
"reverse-engineered" fed information about what a story looks like.
Grammatical rules on how to construct a sentence were given to Brutus.1. It
knows rules of thumb for fiction, such as where to place quotes. And
Brutus.1 will dab in touches of color to give a sense of setting clock
towers, eager students, etc.

The resulting prose can look a bit purple: "A wave of hatred rose up and
flowed like molten blood through every cell in his body." And it can sound
stilted: "To become a doctor, one must pass an oral examination on one's
dissertation."

But on the whole it reads like human prose. During a recent online fiction
contest, just a quarter of the people who gave a guess pegged the computer's
story among the five competing entries. However, Brutus.1's entry also was
the least favorite among the readers.

Why the discouraging reviews?

It might have to do with what Mr. Bringsjord calls "lexical choice" -- that
is, choosing the right words that make sentences flow. It is why "To be or
not to be?" sounds so much better than "Should I kill myself?" The problem
is programming a computer to make those choices.

Kathleen McCoy, a University of Delaware computer scientist involved in
creating systems that create natural-sounding sentences, said a key problem
is people can recognize good writing but have a hard time defining why it is
good.

"It may be perfectly grammatical and even the thoughts it may be getting
across may be reasonable," she said. "But it doesn't look like real text."

Still, natural-language researchers have been making strides in creating
systems to generate picture captions, summaries of multiple newspaper
articles, post-operative medical reports and electronic museum guides.

Kathy McKeown, a Columbia University professor who is a leader in the field,
notes that word choices are much more complicated in fiction.

The feeling among many experts is that the Great Computer Novel won't be
possible for many years, if ever.

Mr. Bringsjord said Brutus.1 or its successors might knock off some sort of
formulaic fiction, such as an action-movie script or a narrative for an
interactive video game. But after seven years of work, he concludes
first-rate storytelling will always be the sole province of human masters

Subject:      exemplary success (Jackson MacLow)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Just quickly, to bring various of my points home, let me bring up the example
of Jackson Maclow's _42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters.  This book,
largely composed through chance operations, is a work that in a real sense
*anyone* could write running Scwitter's writing through the TRAVESTY or
DIASTEXT programs.  A passage, quoted entirely at random, forcibly shows this:

nd was more successful wit
h found than with fabricate
d el
ements.
man-made hil

I
"Schacko"
Hulsendadai

smus = Husk Dadaism advert
ising de
s

. . . and so on.  My purpose is *not* that MacLow's book, or similar
experiments cannot be extremely interesting, but rather to think for a moment
about the work's reception.  It almost goes without saying that had Jacques
Debrot-- or any of thousands of other poets--written _In Memorium_ (& in fact
many have--texts written w/ TRAVESTY proliferate everywhere) the book would
certainly  *not* have been published by Station Hill Press (or likely
anywhere). But in fact, not only was _In Memorium_ published, it won Sun &
Moon's America Award for best small press book of 1995.  *Ironic that work
which attempts to de-authorize the author's authority, depends for its very
existence on that authority.*

But this is to stop too soon.  For what ultimately authorizes a book is the
cultural bussinessman/woman--or publisher.  It is he/she who creates the
creator.  Indeed, a relatively small number of publishers (those associated
w/ the most prestigious presses) have a kind of unchecked power to determine
& shape the field of alternative poetry--unchecked in the sense that there is
an alternative press scene that churns out positive reviews enthusiastically
ratifying any editorial decision these people make.  But, it's funny, even
though these arbiters are largely *self-appointed* (distinguished largely by
their access to economic capital), the audience for experimental poetry never
questions *how* or *why* the determination is made that X's or Y's judgement
of aesthetic value will be/or should be a decisive one.

Taylor Brady
Diane Ward

Taylor Brady is a recent emigre to San Francisco, having spent many years
in the Poetics Program at SUNY Buffalo.  Publications include a chapbook,
Is Placed/Leaves, from Meow Press (1996), and recent poems in Rampike,
kenning, Ribot, and Mirage #4/Period(ical).  His writing inhabits a world
that allows for larger, theoretical critique which at the same time
register personal calibrations, so that politics, love, community are all
at stake in the work and the reading.  Poetry lovers have been holding
their collective breath awaiting Brady's work-in-progress, a book of poems,
prose narratives and critical writing, Phones, Poles, What to Say When
Stepping On Broken Plastic in the Intersection, and Then Again a Hail of
Needles in the Notional Forest. This is his first reading in San Francisco.

Diane Ward owns and controls one of the distinctive voices in America.  A
page of hers is like an illuminated manuscript by Balzac, replete with
colors, senses, sounds and smells, that chronicle the domestic, noting its
intersection with the large social sphere.  Most recently Diane Ward has
written Portraits and Maps (forthcoming 1999 from ML & NLF, Italy),
Imaginary Movie (Potes & Poets), Human Ceiling, Relation and Never Without
One the latter three from Roof Books. Her work has appeared in Crayon,
Conjunctions, How(ever), Big ALLIS, Raddle Moon, The World, and in the
anthologies Out of Everywhere, Moving Borders, the Norton Anthology of
Postmodern American Poetry and From the Other Side of the Century: A New
American Poetry 1960-1990.

publication -
                features:

        -->five new essays on 'writing under constraint'
                (in print, online, and in other cognitive environments)

                -->fifteen further contributions on media theory, poetics,
                                      hypertext

Dear K. Silem Mohammad,
                         I use Hoover as well but supplement the selection
with my own more or less every class. You don't say what level the
course is. In general though I feel you are trying to teach too many
poets in a short time--I'd cut the list by two-thirds, one poet per
session.
             Good luck,
                Wystan Curnow

Not reading too much "meaning" into something doesn't mean it's
meaningless. We were asked what we thought of museum title-cards, so I
figured an opinion was the way to go.

The audience (and maybe writers?) often seems to overvalue titles, is all I
meant to say. And esp. if the work is difficult. Eva Hesse, in my opinion,
someone who solved the artwork/title problem nicely.

I'm all for titles, Hirst's flamboyant "The Physical Impossibility of Death
in the Mind of Someone Living" a particular favorite, in that I find it
much more evocative than the artwork itself.

It may be an act of nomination that begins the process of something becoming
a work of art, but the test wd be its use.   I read an article (published
where?) by my Auckland colleague Stephen Davies, in which he was
demonstrating that Cage's 4 mins 33 secs is not a piece of music.  One
stumbling block for him, I recall -- & this is some time ago &
memory-approximate -- was that he could not imagine what an audience would
do with the "silence" even when juxtaposed with the pianist gestures of
proposing to perform a piece & ending one.

Maybe maybe maybe The Ready-Made exposes misrepresentation etc.

  Do recall though that Marcel Duchamp was very choosy about his
ready-mades.

 There weren't many of them, not everything was appropriate for ready-made;
that they are nearly always rotated or otherwise altered from their usual
postures; that they did always go with a text (a title); that they were
found serendipitously; in short that they are very particular & each is
specific in its workings.  A bicycle wheel inverted on a wooden stool, for
instance is as different in its effect from a row of coat-hooks attached to
a floor, as stilled rotation -- the effect of spokes seen in motion & spokes
seen stilled -- as stumbling & stubbing one's toe on a small obstacle on a
gallery floor.  I always make a point of setting the bicycle wheels in
motion -- because the rotation & stillness is a factor in their being
ready-mades.  But this has to be done surreptitiously because of the "dont
touch" rule in art galleries.  I havent been caught & ejected from a gallery
yet.

I am not content to move to theoretical generalizations about Ready-Mades &
the big question of Nomination, if they are to by-pass the simplest of
critical attentions to -- in this case --  Duchamp's practice.  It is not
clear that painted pictures in galleries are not works of art by a process
of nomination also.  I am far more satisfied by noticing that there are
paintings & writings, which are proposed, some of them as artworks, some of
them not, & some  but not all of those proposed are interesting  & also that
some that are not so proposed are.

Is it impossible to let the problem of definition: of whether something is
an artwork or not, rest in its philosophical space?  I am not convinced that
the attempt to arrive at answers has been of much use.  & to then make use
of such answers as have been proposed in a would-be scientific sociology
sounds to me just a little dubious as an operation.

best  Tony Green

[Here's a post from Friday that somehow got dropped, along with some further
blather from today.  Please delete!]

Just wanted to mention that Maria Damon's brief post kind of sums up a lot
of what I meant in mine -- for her "diaries" I have "modest and/or shameful
poets" like Hopkins who didn't publish, and for her "alpha male" I have
(pardon me) Barrett Watten.

I think Jacques makes some interesting points, though, in one of his
follow-up emails, which is that he is using Bourdieu's frame of discourse
not absolute as a mode of looking at "our" work [which I think he renders
rather monolithically, unfortunately], but that it helps bring in focus many
neglected aspects of this sort of discussion, hence it is merely a tool that
can be put away at any time.  The problem with a too-trusted frame of
discourse is that it invariably affects the data, the literature or the
biographies, that one is attempting to analyze; that is, the "realities" are
created by the frames by which we choose to discuss them [they simply didn't
exist prior to the frames and language].  The homo-erotic subtext of U.S.
Open tennis matches, for example, simply didn't exist until I went to a
match with a gay friend of mine, and he basically transformed the experience
into something rather different, and in a sense a "total" interpretation.
Consequently, we spend a lot of time trying to tell people what they are
_really_ thinking and _really_ doing without spending the time to enter into
this activity with a sense of detail, "luminous" detail, if you will.  An
example: when people were asking whether WCW as an "anti-semite," an answer
just couldn't offer itself because the frame of the discourse didn't permit
a suitable answer, it was either/or, and it seemed ridiculous to put WCW on
one side with the Nazis and Ezra Pound, but not quite right to put him on
the other.  If you had none of the Puritan furor that characterizes some
writers on writers, then the frame here is totally useless -- the statements
are lifeless.  The frame of the discourse should be malleable based on the
topic or materials being examined; also, we should be satisfied with no
answer.

One of my problems with this thread is that there's not a lot of new data
being presented, just revisions of the model of analysis, hence the frame
grows more complex but the range of references becomes very isolated, and
generalizations are tossed around, such as about the role of Donald Allen's
anthology in the plays of cultural capital.  My sense is that the role the
anthology played in New York culture among those who were actively involved,
i.e. "included", in it, was probably much smaller than what is made of it by
us, the successors who view it as some sort of milestone.  [Bourdieau seems,
to me, to be writing the story of the "successors," the ones who look back,
whereas I think the view from over here, the present, while not having the
benefit of being based on the past and hence based on a close set of texts,
is better and more complicated.]  It probably wasn't a milestone to Frank
O'Hara, he knew all that work (and probably thought a lot of it was
terrible) -- just a drop in the bucket, something to chat about between
movies -- there were more exciting things happening.  As for how it might
have given him more prestige among his peers and readers, it's probably safe
to assume that, say when it came time to have a coke or have a lover, this
prestige could have been a hindrance, or at least a non-entity.  That the
anthology was the shot heard around the world may not have meant much to him
(just as we can probably agree that Rimbaud didn't care much for what the
Season in Hell was doing to Paris when he was in his thirties, or Hopkins
what his sonnets were doing in Bridges' underwear drawer).  How, in this
Bourdieau-ian scheme, in which the politics and symbolism of religion seem
to have been entirely absorbed (the transubstantiantion of matter plays a
role here, for when writing becomes "literature" and hence cultural capital,
along with the near-paranoic interconnecitivity of motives and actions, at
least as presented by Jacques), how does one then explain what is, in
Hopkins, a tension between his life as a priest and his desire to write
poetry, which he equated with earthly vanity?  Or the tensions Dickinson
felt -- her consciousness of this very issue was intense -- in writing her
verse?  Or Blake?  In other words, how does it account for those spheres in
which cultural capital can be acquired -- as any religious order or
religious social system would have to be considered -- and where it is
negated by the accessing of other cultural spheres which are destined to be
unsatisfactory?  I guess the problem is with envisioning a sort of totality
for this cultural stage, and an inability, or unwillingness, to see the
various blindnesses that exist between them.

As for the "why write" question, one thing I might suggest is that one
writes to render one's immediate environment either more predictable
(Davidson/Rorty again) or more interesting, perhaps even more "stimulating"
in a sexual way (somewhat different that the idea of the poem as unalienated
labor, which is worth mentioning since my own computer-poems are very
alienated labor, but I think they're "stimulating" to me to have in the
environment).  This basic idea encapsulates, I think, the idea of writing as
the creation of "cultural capital" since one is writing to propel oneself
further on some path toward, on the one hand, self-identity
("predictability" from day-to-day, satisfaction) which one perhaps
mistakenly believes comes throught public recognition, and the chance to
enter new spheres of being (getting a little reknown, going to better
parties), on other words in changing one's lifestyle (because one thinks
that having money and being famous is more interesting than not).  But it
also takes in those writers who don't operate in any of these ways, such as
those who keep poems in diaries and those who, in a different light, write
some version of pornography for themselves just to keep them going (such as
R. Crumb, or his brother who, in the documentary about Crumb, wrote line
after line of tiny type which was not legible to anyone), or those whose
writing, like Edward Taylor's, were spiritual excercises in preparation for
sermons.  But that's just an idea.

Maybe, in sum, the problem with this framework is that it envisions all
writing as _productive_ and doesn't take into consideration inversion, or
"perversion", i.e. that which is rejected by the symbolic system -- can an
author with a sense of the "habitus" etc. write "perversely" or "inversely"
or only willingly strange?

or just pick out a some few words from within the poem and make that the

Jacques,
Of course the "context" and thus the "meaning" of whatever - letters, notes,
poems, and everything else that isn't "writing" - changes.  If it didn't,
everything wld be frozen in place.  My responsibility for "what ha(d) been
said" in fact WAS to present a version I knew to be changed, and that I
hoped wld continue to change, tho I know "the ripple effect" never works -
the waters are always "calmed" by someone with an antithetical intent and
maybe ulterior motive.  Okay, so

the context changed the meaning - what are you meaning to suggest?  That
that's "unethical"?  For God's sake, Jacques!  What do you want -the world
to stay the way you propose it?  I've always thought one purpose of writing
was to completely disturb that sense of "tradition" we might call The
Archival.  Like, what's it FOR?  To dream ahead by looking always back - or
to "ground" the goof of the present moment?  I mean,

I like the way you continually propose the "difficulty" in the act of
writing, but I can't help thinking you'd like to keep it, by just those
means, the "difficulty", you know, like that old comedy routine - "one for
me and one for you, three for me and two for you, eleven for me and four for
you, etc."  I don't mind being trumped, but I can't help feeling behind some
of your recent theoretical posts a nagging yet unadmitted clawing after what
in the past you've called "cultural capital."  It's as if you argue such
issues abstractly because you feel you aren't getting enough of it, and it
shows.

In the end, viz my recirculating your withdrawn post and your suggestion
here that I had or have some ulterior motive, I say I probably do (or did),
and it's that I don't feel any particular "responsibility" to "history" in
the "archival" sense - or any loyalty toward the privacy of those who do.
Break down and open up!
S E

Terrific post.  As the publisher/conceiver of LIVE AT THE EAR (Elemenope
Productions, 1994, edited by Charles Bernstein), it isn't quite fair to say
that simple access to funding confers a right to publish anything
successfully.  Distinguished largely by my access to INTELLECTUAL capital
and FRIENDSHIP capital, a product in Capitalism came to life to stand on its
own.  It (The immortal CD) was something that sprang to life by itself in my
imagination and in a very bizarre fashion the money, as they say, happened.
So we (Charles, the poets, the factories and technicians) did it.

Just a postscript to my ramble:

Jacques writes:

> Just quickly, to bring various of my points home, let me bring up the
example
of Jackson Maclow's _42 Merzgedichte in Memoriam Kurt Schwitters.  This
book,
largely composed through chance operations, is a work that in a real sense
*anyone* could write running Scwitter's writing through the TRAVESTY or
DIASTEXT programs.  [...]  My purpose is *not* that MacLow's book, or
similar
experiments cannot be extremely interesting, but rather to think for a
moment
about the work's reception.  It almost goes without saying that had Jacques
Debrot-- or any of thousands of other poets--written _In Memorium_ (& in
fact
many have--texts written w/ TRAVESTY proliferate everywhere) the book would
certainly  *not* have been published by Station Hill Press (or likely
anywhere). But in fact, not only was _In Memorium_ published, it won Sun &
Moon's America Award for best small press book of 1995.  *Ironic that work
which attempts to de-authorize the author's authority, depends for its very
existence on that authority.*

I think a key to my problem with you ideas is here, which is that you feel
this work doesn't exist until it is published, and that your point hinges on
the idea of its being published immediately.  If Jacques Debrot had created
that work, however, say in high school, being the only kid in his high
school who knew about DIASTEXT, and who had never heard of Jackson Mac Low
before but had an interest in say Cage and industrial music, who's to say
that, after meeting up with a friend who had an interest in "poetry" who
recognized the "literary" value of this work, it would not have been
published?  And is a work more a work because it has won an award (you've
never met anyone that thought a different work should win a particular
award, or does everyone buy into the prestige?)  Also, where do you come to
this understanding that Mac Low's work "attempts to de-authorize the
author's authority"?  It's not that easy.  Obviously, if Mac Low is placing
Schwitter's name in the title, he must have fairly "traditional" ideas of
the ownership of works and of the meaning of lives ("In Memorium" not being
entirely ironic), and in fact in the idea of tradition at all.  It's works
like this that point to a different sort of irony, which is that of the
"modernist tradition," one which we are a "part of", in that we have adopted
various forms of form-breaking that have become this "tradition," though as
you would agree this irony, complexity, the social institutions associated
with it, etc., is at the core of many of these issues we are discussing.
What you also fail to note, in this case, are parrallel examples, such as:
Hugh Kenner, not a poet, had a book published using this program (hence, the
frame extends to the literary critic, not just to the operations of poets,
so where does this frame stop?), and that Charles O. Hartmann's name will be
attached to all of these works as a collaborator of sorts since he in fact
wrote the program (programs, as a programmer will tell you, are often
"beautiful solutions", never quite "beautiful" but can have an elegance
which, when placed with the data, contribute much to the nature of the
satisfaction).  I don't feel there is anything about the Merzgedichte that
suggests that Mac Low believed that "anyone" could have written them, or
that he wanted anyone to believe this, actually, just as I don't feel anyone
could have written my computer poems, even with the program.  If you want to
fault the reception of this work, that is fair game, but (not to open the
bogeyman of "intention" here) I don't think that, in going through these
processes (and in revising the text, which I don't doubt he did, though I
could be wrong -- Cage revised his) that he felt that he was merely
following through on basic implications present in the literary and/or
scientific universe, that anyone could have done them, and that he would
not, someday, translate this work into spoken speech, using his particular
skills of performance at a later time (where intentionality and "authority",
like in much music performance, is played out in the between spaces, the
slurs and flourishes, between moments dictated by textual form).  Our young
high school poet (or for the sake of argument, very old gardener who had an
interest in linguistics, or maybe ex-Republican speech writer who wanted to
make a change in her life) could, perhaps, have written this work, but it
would have been with a different series of contingencies, one of which may
have been publishing opportunities but others of which exist, and require
attention (maybe his great grandmother was an ex-schoolchum of Schwitters,
who knows?).

How would you explain what happens in McCaffery/Rasula's Imagining
Language -- did those people operate along the lines you mention?  And what
if Bodenheim's poems printed in Revolution of the Word had taken the world
by storm, and today we thought him the master and Williams the fool -- then
what?

> For what ultimately authorizes a book is the cultural
bussinessman/woman--or publisher.  It is he/she who creates the
creator.  Indeed, a relatively small number of publishers (those associated
w/ the most prestigious presses) have a kind of unchecked power to determine
& shape the field of alternative poetry--unchecked in the sense that there
is an alternative press scene that churns out positive reviews
enthusiastically ratifying any editorial decision these people make.  But,
it's funny, even though these arbiters are largely *self-appointed*
(distinguished largely by their access to economic capital), the audience
for experimental poetry never questions *how* or *why* the determination is
made that X's or Y's judgement of aesthetic value will be/or should be a
decisive one.

I don't see where you come up with this -- unchecked power?  Sure, a lot of
this contains truth, but who is this "audience" and how can you say they
"never question" these hows and whys?  Who are you talking to?  What about
the power of the larger publishing scene and the way it plays on "ours" --
i.e. isn't the context of these flattering reviews (and I agree with you
some of this) really the still continuing battle between what the true
moneyed press sees as worthwhile -- the Knopfs and the Vintages -- and "our"
presses?  (It would be a more interesting place if anyone believed this war
going on -- it probably isn't, but I still think it's a component of this
cycle of reviews.)  Consequently, in general I think you snap back and forth
between basing your theory on things you think about writing _today_ and
what happened in the past (when, for example, a poem like Kora in Hell would
have had to have been published in France, or when Mac Low's early works
didn't appear in book form but were, rather, performed at the New School, or
were the backdrops to dances or other cultural events, or even shouted on
stree corners).  What is your intention -- to discover an all-time, or at
least widely applicable, truth about cultural production and meaning, or to
find a platform from which to lambhast the present time, and our present
community?

Lastly (sorry about this length, again!) I also don't undestand your point
on Williams and OTHERS -- it seemed that, with the writing he wanted to do,
he would have distanced himself from them, but you seem to suggest that he
promoted or supported their work because it took him along with them?  Why
wouldn't he develop his work from their methods, seeing as they composed the
"habitus" in which he was playing out his game?  Maybe I'm missing
something.  Did he expect Duchamp to take him up, and push him into the
French avant-garde?  Also, why read my little deathbed thing -- which is
probably baloney anyway, I admit -- in the context of a VICTORIAN novel, why
not place it in the context of a novel by Robbe-Grillet, where such things
can appear?  It would be the same moment, different meaning, less determined
frame.  Are you trying to read literary culture in terms of the Victorian
novel -- what about in terms of quantum physics?

Respectfully,
Brian

Subject:      OTHERS and poetic value
In-Reply-To:  <d3.1384807.25d02b58@aol.com> from "Jacques Debrot" at Feb 7,

I feel I should fess up that I'm the source for the info which
Jacquescites on OTHERS below, particularly since it's not perfectly
accurate.  The basic premise is quite true: there's much work in OTHERS
whose we would be hardpressed to explain in terms of literary value.
Maxwell Bodenheim, who Jacques briefly quotes below, is a constant - and
he's terrible! I say this with genuine consciousness of my own biases -
what's interesting to me is just how terrible I think he is, and *why* he
seems to me to pale in comparison to other regular contributors like
Williams or Mina Loy.  The fact is, Williams - who had a lot of input with
OTHERS though I believe Alfred Kreyborg was officially its editor - had
what we would call a pretty good eye for talent - among the regular
contributors to OTHERS you'll find Loy, Moore, Pound, Stevens.  But you'll
also find Bodenheim, John Gould Fletcher, Walter Arensberg, Helen Hoyt
("You are more shadowy than frost flowers / Growing in your smooth
atmosphere").  (Aside: I was wrong about Schofield Thayer, who published
mostly in THE DIAL - though this too was a place Williams frequently
published - "Portrait of a Lady" appeared in it in 1920; and Schofield
Thayer sucks!)  In addition, there are interesting examples of OTHERS
contrubtors who have been forgotten who are actually pretty damn good --
Mina Loy would have fit this category until a few years ago, and she's
actually one of my favorites as I'm sure some on this list would agree.
Another, though less prolific, is Orrick Johns, who's poems are fucking
hilarious! and totally forgotten.  Williams mentions his "Blue Undershirts
on a Line" as a big influence on the OTHERS crowd:

Blue undershirts,
Upon a line,
It is not necessary to say to you
Anything about it--
What they do,
What they might do . . . blue undershirts.

"Comic objectivism," I'd call it.  But Johns' real gift was for finding a
space for the stupid and frivolous in modernist poetry:

Miggles--
That was his name,
Everyone always said,
"Miggles did it."
Oh, Miggles,
I admired you from the beginning,
Miggles!

(Come to think of it, this says a lot about how "admiration" gets
generated "magically" as Jacques said.)  Here's my particular favorite"

Now I know
I have been eating apple-pie for breakfast
In the New England
Of your sexuality.

Funny!  Johns has a pretty good book of this stuff called ASPHALT.  He
didn't sustain it, though.  Is that it, longevity?  One factor I suppose.
But, getting back to Jacques original pts., how were decisions being made
about inclusion in OTHERS and what, if anything, did they have to do with
poetic/aesthetic value?  It seems clear to me that it was a mish-mosh of
many factors: friendship, *money*, individual perisistence, lobbying, and
yes, the communities aesthetic values too -- but less than one might
think.  Modernism, maybe, was not as policed as we might presume (Pound's
"amygism" efforts aside) - and in any event, I've never thoughts that a
term which sought to umbrella the work of Stein, Eliot, WCW, Pound, Loy
(to say nothing of Orrick Johns, or Maxwell Bodenheim, or, in a better
vein, Kenneth Fearing) held a whole lot of water.  If you're in New York
in 1920, or if you're all reading John Dewey, or if 3 of you are listening
to Bessie Smith, then, sure, you've got something in common -- but,
MODERNISM? No.

What this says about today's climate, is unclear (whoops, wasn't that the
topic?).  I think Jacques is probably right that, having dispensed largely
with aesthetic criteria (other than some vague - very vague - requirement
that one be "experimental") other criteria have filled the void -- and
this is what makes Bordieu seem like the prophet of our current situation.
My main concern is that in accepting Bordieu as gospel truth, we might
extniguish all possibilties of ethical action (in the most secular sense).
Is a writer in, say 1975 South Africa, whose work is designed - *designed*
- to promote the overthrow of Apartheid, taking this symbolic action
merely to create a space in which to better accrue capital for himself?
Which is to say, is the writing of this hypothetical person strictly an
ego-driven affair?  But if the Self is a site of mediation, where does
that leave a theory which, at bottom, seems to depend pretty heavily ona
model of self-interest?  Or even group-interest in a strict sense, since
they too are mediated and permeable.

A memorial tribute to
EDWARD DORN
Thursday, February 17, 7:30 pm, free
@ The Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

With special guests GORDON BROTHERSTON, BOB CALLAHAN, TOM CLARK, STEPHEN
EMERSON, JOANNE KYGER, DUNCAN McNAUGHTON, and TOM RAWORTH.

EDWARD DORN, who died on the 10th of this past December at his home in
Denver, will be remembered by a gathering of friends this evening in San
=46rancisco.  Born in 1929 in Eastern Illinois, Mr. Dorn attended Black
Mountain College during the 1950s and would come to prominence with the
publication of several remarkable early poems in Donald Allen's renowned
anthology The New American Poetry.

His many books published over four decades in the US and the UK include The
Collected Poems 1956-1974 (Four Seasons, Bolinas, 1975), the novel The
Rites of Passage (Frontier Press, Buffalo, 1965), later issued as By the
Sound, the long dramatic narrative poem Gunslinger, issued serially, and
eventually collected in 1975 (Berkeley, Wingbow Press), Recollections of
Gran Apacheria (Turtle Island, San Francisco, 1974), and several volumes of
translations from Spanish, Portuguese, and Native American languages, done
with Gordon Brotherston, and recently collected in the volume The Sun
Unwound: Original Texts from Occupied America (North Atlantic Books,
Berkeley, 1999).

". . . The mission bells are ringing
in Kansas.
Have you left something out.
Negative, says my Gunslinger,
no _thing_ is omitted."

ANNE CARSON
Thursday February 24, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ The Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

A classics scholar thoroughly in touch with the subtleties of contemporary
poetry, Anne Carson several years ago appeared with a brilliant work on the
intimacies of classic Greek poetry, Eros the Bittersweet.  *  More
recently, few books of contemporary poetry have enjoyed the audience
afforded her "novel in verse," Autobiography of Red.  * Her other works
include Glass, Irony and God, and Plainwater: Essays & Poems.  *  Ms.
Carson is the visiting Holloway Lecturer at UC Berkeley this spring
semester.  *  Her latest critical work, Economy of the Unlost, analyzes the
poetics of Paul Celan and Simonides of Keos, and is just out from
Princeton, and her opera installation--The Mirror of Simple Souls--can be
viewed at www.ummu.umich.edu/projects/souls.  *  She lives in Montr=E9al,
Qu=E9bec. *

The mailman has for once not stolen all the best books of poetry that
(should) come my way! So, last week brought the excellent:

_A Paradise of Poets_ by Jerome Rothenberg (New Directions $14.95, ISBN
0-8112-1427-3)consisting of new poems and translations. I am amazed how
little New Directions does to move their books around -- & amazed at the
fact that books like this get so little review space anywhere. Here is one
of the very finest American poets writing at the top of his form & no notice
is taken.


An amazing week it was because another, long awaited major collection of
poetry arrived a day later:

_At Dusk Iridescent_ by Thomas Meyer being a substantial selection of
Meyer's poems from 1972 to 1997 (The Jargon Spociety, ISBN 0912330-81-3,
somewhat expensive at $40 but one of the most beautiful books I have seen in
a long time, & well worth the price of admission). Meyer is one of North
America's great hidden treasures: a lyric poet of amazing reach & exactness
of sound, a Bunting-like terseness and yet an ability to flow and move
through a wide range of cultures and languages, of lore and fact. One of the
finest ears now attending to the work of poetry, and of my own generation,
probably the finest.

& now this week has also already brought a beaut:

Allen Fisher's _The Topological Shovel_ , from Nate Dorward's Gig Editions
in Canada. A much-needed gathering/reprint of 4 AF essays that shed light
not only on his won work of the 80ies and 90ies (the _Gravity as a
consequenc eof shape_ project) but are to my mind among the most important
essays on poetics of those decades.

Dear Wystan,

Thanks for the feedback.  I think you're right: I'll probably trim the list
a bit, although it's tough.

As for the level, it will be a mixed bag of undergrads, I think.  Santa Cruz
students tend to be into the adventurous stuff on average, so I think most
of them will get something out of it despite the difficulty of much of the
reading.  Each class session is 2 and a half hours, so there's plenty of
hashing-it-out time.

Cheers,

Kasey

                           February 23, 2000

In Stephanie Strickland's cyberpoem "True North," embodied experience is
refracted through the specialized languages of mathematics, science, myth,
and history, with the figures of Emily Dickinson and Willard Gibbs,
America's first mathematical physicist, at the heart of the poem's
historical section. Released on disk by Eastgate Systems, "True North"
subsequently won a 1998 Salt Hill Hypertext Prize, and has been presented at
the 1999 Technology Platforms for 21st Century Literature conference at
Brown University hosted by Robert Coover, at the AM98 Art and Mathematics
Conference hosted by UC Berkeley, and at the 1998 MLA conference in San
Francisco. Strickland will present portions of True North as well as two
multimedia Web poems, one of which, "The Ballad of Sand and Harry Soot," won
About.com's Best of the Net Poetry award.

About Stephanie Strickland:

Stephanie Strickland is widely hailed as one of our most brilliant
practitioners of and thinkers about cyberspace, and as one of our finest
poets. She has been the recipient of a great many honors and awards for her
work. True North has won three national prizes, two as a print book version
and another as a hypertext. Booklist noted that particularly the poem's
title sequence, "beginning with the difference between magnetic and true
north, . . . launches into an exploration of the forces of love, until the
metaphor links science and the heart so tightly that they are inseparable. .
. . The force of [Strickland's] passion for ideas and for human connection
sustains" the entirety of the poem. True North is especially rooted in
women's experience. Strickland has authored many other acclaimed works
including her essays on digital text, one itself a hypertext, which have
appeared in the Electronic Book Review. She has been the recipient of the
Ernest Sandeen Poetry Prize and was chosen by Barbara Guest for the Alice
Fay di Castagnola Award from the Poetry Society of America, and, for The Red
Virgin: A Poem of Simone Weil, was awarded the Brittingham Prize by the
University of Wisconsin Press. A print version of the "Ballad of Sand and
Harry Soot" was selected for the 1999 Boston Review Prize by Heather McHugh.
Her other awards include a New York Foundation for the Arts Poetry
Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship, a National
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in hypertext poetry, and the Open
Voice Award of the West Side YMCA. She is also the author of the highly
praised book of poems, Give the Body Back.

Refreshments will be served.

I've got some stock on some good books. Odds and ends of the Leave Books
project. If you want one or more, let me know. They are for free and no
postage is necessary, but any money you might care to send will be put
towards production costs of Chain. But if you are broke, don't feel like
you need to send any. I would just rather have the books out in the
world than in my office. First come, first served.

Here is the list:

Julia Blumenreich, Artificial Memory
Guy Beining, Too Far to Hear
Cole Swensen, Walk
Tom Beckett, Economies of Pure Expenditure
Peter Ganick, As Convenience
C. S. Giscombe, Two Sections of Giscome Road

once a year the Homeless Action Committee of Albany holds its big fund
raiser sleep-a-thon.  This year it will be:

Friday, Feb. 15th, 7PM to Sunrise,
Townsend Park (Corner of Henry Johnson Blvd. & Central Ave.), Albany, NY

Funds raised will benefit the Homeless Action Committee's Single Room
Occupancy Residence ("Our House") and the Outreach Van.  "Our House" is
a
home for chronic alcoholics who would otherwise be living on the streets

of Albany.  HAC's van makes rounds on the streets, providing a listening

ear, food, clothing, blankets and transportation to homeless people.  In

1999, HAC raised $10,000 from this event, which was attended by over 100

people.  Students, elected officials (Congressman McNulty slept out all
night for the 4th consecutive year!), church groups, and supporters all
participated.

Through the generosity of my family, friends & fellow poets, I raised
over $300 last year.  Please join us on Feb. 25 & make a contribution.
If you can't join us, but would like to help, I plan on staying until at

least Midnight.  If you would like to make a pledge to sponsor my cold
night in the park, please email me with the amount of your contribution.

Then send a check payable to The Homeless Action Committee to me, Dan
Wilcox, 280 South Main Ave., Albany, NY  12208.

Thank you very much & I hope you can help.

We must be of a similart aGE ALL right. Well, I am only 5 years younger
than Bromige. My father, too, really liked Thorne Smith. Thorne Smith was
supposed to be racy back in the 40s. The only one I ever read was _Did She
=46all?_ but I certainly remember _The Glorious Pool_ being in the house.
Theycame in those early Pocket Books with the glassine wrapt covers. And as
a matter of fact I recently purchased a copy of _The Passionate Witch_,
Pocket Book 401, second printing, July 1946.

sometime in December, any publisher who wishes to have their recent
publications listed, should send all information to
jerrold@durationpress.com (please include titles, authors, prices,

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Jacques,

Thanks for your post.  While I agree with you that the "how" is at least as
important & difficult a question as the "why," in terms of writing poetry (&
this in itself could be a subject for a whole new thread), I'm not sure that
I agree with the dualism you seem to argue between a "romantic or
essentialist" poetics, on the one hand, & "innovative" poetries on the
other.  In fact, I would argue that genuine innovation has occurred rarely
throughout literary history, & that the claim for oppositional poetries as
implicitly innovative thus is misleading.  Duncan's (admittedly romantic)
position to me seems more honest, & even liberating.  We are all, in some
sense, derivative of the poetries that precede us; why not admit it & get on
with the work at hand.

While I agree with your aversion to purely essentialist literary ideologies,
I think that many poets work with vestiges of "romantic or essentialist"
modes, torquing them in new & interesting ways without succumbing to
essentialism as such.  The work of Anselm's dad, talked about earlier, seems
to me a case in point.

Ultimately the poets who most interest me do not so much adapt their work to
one or another position but (in my reading of their work) use the two
positions as outer limits, or points of tension for their projects.  & If
writing poems ever becomes too "easy," as you claim, then surely it is when
the ideological Rules of the Game have been predetermined, & one's efforts
thus become a footnote to the conclusion rather than a nexus for discovery.

Mark DuCharme

Hello all:

A word or two from Kenning HQ.  First, the Kenning website has been
redesigned and thus greatly simplified.  You'll find a complete and up to
date index of authors past and future with plenty of links to work on-line.
 Among these authors with on-line work are two new additions, Daniel
Bouchard and Tisa Bryant respectively.  Please have a look.

The forthcoming issue is still, well, forthcoming.  It's a special,
collaboratively-edited issue, entitled "Cunning:  a descriptive checklist
of tentative politics," myself, Renee Gladman, Jen Hofer, and Rod Smith
editors.  It ought to be available and heading off in the post in two weeks
or so.  The spring 2000 issue, featuring new work by Ilarie Voronca
(translated from the Romanian by Julian Semilian and Sanda Agalidi),
Jackson Mac Low, Elizabeth Robinson, Lytle Shaw, Susan Briante, Rodrigo
Toscano, and many many others, will be available without delay in high April.

Since each issue of Kenning tends to sell out within a few weeks of its
release, I'd recommend entering a subscription soon, if possible.  Besides,
subscriptions pay for the production and distribution of the newsletter.

In the meantime, click on the URL below and get a taste.

For those of you who might be in the area:
The Annual Conference of the Robinson Jeffers Association will take place
Feb. 26-27 and the Sunset Cultural Center in Carmel, CA.  The conference
does feature scholarly papers, but it also features open discussion of
Jeffers and his work, poetry readings, and other, more atypical happenings
for a "conference."  I encourage anyone who is interested in Jeffers to
attend.

Oh no, no, I do admit it, I'd like some more of that (but you/we mean
*symbolic capital)--my work, like everyone's, has a social trajectory.  The
more general confusion on the Poetics List between symbolic/cultural capital,
though, is mostly due to your forwarding my b/c where I am not sufficiently
careful about the distinction--so now I'm not quite sure when someone means
the one or the other.  That's a little bit of a drag--but I don't have any
investment in the archival or historical or whatever preservation of my
remarks in this medium--they are so littered w/ typos, etc. that I would
rather they all disappeared anyway.

I think the following quote adds a whole new dimension to the
discussion, particularly if reference is to poetry/painting
collaboration, webart, or visual poetry.  It is an issue of
interaction
of parts, not just a linear question
"Part of the fascination of renaissance emblems and of modern
advertisements is the tension between the puzzling image, the
laconic
_inscriptio_, and the mobile and apparently dissociated
_subscriptio_.
That tension affects reading and looking , as the viewer is
often not
entirely sure where to look first or where to look for an
explanation,"

The Opening of the Field: A Conference on
North American Poetry in the 1960s
University of Maine
Orono, Maine
June 28-July 2, 2000

The National Poetry Foundation invites paper and panel proposals for a
conference on North American poetry of the 1960s. Proposals are welcome>on
writers of previous generations whose literary careers extended into
the 1960s, such as Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Robert Lowell, Charles
Olson, Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Lorine Niedecker, etc.; on poets
or literary movements that climaxed in the 1960s, including the Beat,
Black Mountain, San Francisco Renaissance, and New York schools; on
women poets and poets of color, who achieved a broader visibility
during this decade; and on new literary moments that began to define
themselves in this period, such as the ethnopoetic movement and
language-centered writing. Papers are also invited on the general
cultural background of the period, including such themes as the
tensions between "academic" poetry and various attempts to bring poetry
into the lives of people "in the streets"; the relationship of poetry
and popular culture, including rock music; and the role of poetry in
the anti-war movement. As the title of the conference suggests, we
invite proposals on Canadian as well as on American poetry in the 1960s.

The conference will begin on Wednesday evening, June 28, and will
conclude shortly after noon on Sunday, July 2. Accommodations will be
available at a reasonable rate in university residence halls.
Registration will be $85, with a reduced rate of $60 for graduate
students.

Confirmed participants as of February 1, 2000, include Marjorie
Perloff, Albert Gelpi, Charles Altieri, Michael Davidson, Joan
Retallack, Frank Davey, Lorenzo Thomas, Rosmarie Waldrop, Keith
Waldrop, Ann Charters, Joseph Conte, Keith Tuma, Mark Scroggins, Maria
Damon, Alan Golding, Barrett Watten, Lynn Keller, Peter Middleton, Ron
Silliman, Kathleen Fraser, George Bowering, Aldon Nielsen, Michael
Heller, Jane Augustine, Theodore Enslin, and many others..

                                Burton Hatlen, Director,

What this says about today's climate, is unclear (whoops, wasn't that the

with aesthetic criteria (other than some vague - very vague - requirement
that one be "experimental") other criteria have filled the void -- and
this is what makes Bordieu seem like the prophet of our current situation.
My main concern is that in accepting Bordieu as gospel truth, we might
extniguish all possibilties of ethical action (in the most secular sense).

i think Mike's long post about Others, is interesting precisely because of
the confidence with which he puts forth his distinctions and rankings...
He is certainly right (when you compare his "old fashioned" off-hand
grading, with much on the list)  that one feature of this and related
debates is the feeling that some people "have dispensed largely with
esthetic criteria (other than....etc."  Now i'm not clear that he's right
that this is Jacques' point;  it often sounds as tho Jacques's point is
that esthetic criteria don't really *exist* objectively, at any time..and
so vying for cultural capital and institutional hegemony is all poets
*ever* do, as their main focus... This is quite different from the
historically-specific dynamic outlined in Mike's passage i quote above...

in any event, i guess my own intuitive feel, is that actual shared (or
shareable, debateable) "esthetic criteria" are essentially more unstable
than MM believes;  but not as unstable, and subject to institutional fiat,
as JD does..or actually, i think that maybe they come close to being as
unstable and objectively undetermined as JD thinks..it's just that the
ramifications for this, for both readers and poets, seem less dire to me
than to Jacques...

The new issue of Skanky Possum contains a piece by Kent Johnson about this
list, accusing Bernstein et al of censorship. Am I alone in thinking forms
of censorship on this list include a breakdown whenever and wherever issues
of gender have been or attempted to have been addressed. Chris, if you don't
post this, I think I'll be grateful actually.

More censorious questions or why I generally lurk.
        Why does the discourse have to be so - to put it politely - academic? Is
this really the only way to be rigorous? What about the rigor of humor?
David Hess posted a piece about a Gertrude Stein conference to this List
some time ago in which he made his points with big tasty dollops of
hilarity. Hoa Nguyen, who later printed the piece in _Skanky Possum_ (issue
#2 i think) mentioned backchannel to me the profound silence with which this
was met, listside. From my early days on the list, I also recall fondly
Wendy Kramer's happy post on Lisa Robertson's _Debbie: An Epic_, in which
she rendered both a scan of the scene at a reading Robertson gave in New
York and her own reading of _Debbie_ with an enthuisasm at once intricate
and flip, like a flower. Alas such pleasures are few and far between.  Is it
the nature of listservs to dull the senses? Are we to believe high
seriousness to be the only argot that translates on email? (I work at Kmart
so I don't have to talk like that. A joke.)  (A joke is offensive. -- My
fake Gertrude Stein quote.)

sent with good wishes, Elizabeth

Sigh. Still at it, eh, George? GB is a scant 2 years my junior (in age,
that is).  And as we see above, already forgetting not only how to spell,
but what the difference is between upper and lower case. And between 1933
and 1935. He shd be abt ready for a dive into the Glorious Pool himself.

(And I dont believe I characterized The Glorious Pool as _bedside_ reading.
In fact, I sd it was tame enough after one has limped thru bkly in the 60s.
Not to mention vancouver in the 50s [v. further recommended reading,
Bowering, Bowering, Matthews and Bromige, _Piccolo Mondo_, Coach House
Books, Toronto.])

In short :  Harrumph!!

Hi Jonathan,

Yes, a book of titles without poems. The Table of Contents and Index as
literary forms. I think up and find titles all the time. I just dump them
into the body of whatever I'm working on. Then when a new poem is done, I
search the last poem and pull out a good title. It's great to get the poems
talking to each other, echoing each other. I've enjoyed this thread as it's
the first in some time to address nuts and bolts.

Regards,

Pete

One correction to the calendar:

Brenda Coultas and Tim Davis had been scheduled
to read on Saturday, 26 February at the Steel Bar
(511 Tri-Main Building, Buffalo). Unfortunately, due
to unforseen circumstances, Brenda Coultas will be
unable to make the event, and I will be reading in her
stead. Tim Davis will appear as scheduled.

Hello Everyone,

Cid Corman's financial difficulties persist. I forward to the List, below, a
message from Joe Massey who is trying to help Cid; his idea is that Cid
could do some teaching (university adjunct work, for example, or perhaps a
one-shot or series of workshops for an organization like Poets House or the
Poetry Project) via the internet, for a fee. It is actually a fine idea for
the right situation. Cid's point of view and reading ability are unique.
Anyway, never mind my opinion on this, here is Massey:

"I'm writing on behalf of Cid Corman. He's interested in doing an online
workshop / class, and has asked me to gather information for him. If you
have any suggestions as to how to go about this, know of any organizations
or schools that might be interested in hosting such an event, please contact
me at masseyjoseph@hotmail.com."

Thank you,

Wheeww---a breath of fresh air. Thanks, Elizabeth, for your Gertrude list
post and now this.

It's been kinda hard for me to read all the academic stuff lately. Yes, I
know I can delete. But it's not that I'm necessarily annoyed with any
particular post/thread--just simply the fact that almost ALL of it lately
seems so imploding-star-like. The gravity has worn out its welcome.

But I *am* reading an extraordinarily delicate and oblique book about
classic koans, "Two Arrows Meeting in Mid-Air," by John Daido Loori --and
want to send along a quote:

"A gourd floating on the water--push it down and it turns. A jewel in the
sunlight--it has no definite shape. It cannot be attained by mindlessness,
nor known by mindfulness. Immeasurably great people are turned about in the
stream of words--is there anyone who can escape?"

Subject:      minor (?) clarification
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Since I posted a few hours ago (& have spent a happy rainy afternoon reading
D. Barnes' _Nightwood_) I see I have gotten a lot of backchannels from
various Poetics List citizens.

I would just like to clarify that I do not agree with Kent Johnson that
Charles Bernstein and Christopher Alexander are performing acts of
censorship. Indeed, I would say that the fact that many women I know and
know of feel or have felt uncomfortable, unheard, abused, etc when trying to
engage in the discourse on this list (and I don't want to leave out any men
who've felt the same) ALONG WITH the fact that a very few, mostly male,
people seem to do most of the posting, taking up a necessarily limited space
(limited by how much email one wants to read perhaps rather than by
cyberspace) are
both in themselves forms of censorship
which is not a censorship that can be laid
to blame and rest on the head of Mr. B or Mr. A,
or indeed anyone in particular,
ah there's the rub

I'd much rather have this discussed in this forum than to be flooded with
backchannels. Thanks,

Elizabeth

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The fact that a luminary like Susan Howe does not even want to hear
secondhand of what goes on on this list (a little bird told me) makes Kent
Johnson's theory (as spelled out in that recent issue of Skanky Possum) that
the exclusion of Henry Gould from this list marks "Language writing's
institutional denouement" seem, well, if not absurd, at least a very minor
point.

I will let this play itself out without further comment from me, though I
cling to the hope that others find the gender imbalance here troubling along
with the impossibility, it seems, of discussing issues of gender -- in
poetics -- .

or even, why must anyone maintain the cloak of rigor, why not talk or

or the journalistic or the diaristic.

this list is a virtual anomaly, sometimes I wonder when it will recover
a vital idenitity which is only now suggested.  a real part of list
culture is the spontaneity of reply.  if I happen to write late at
night, the late at night crew can kick in with a tag team discussion,
with its own tenor & its own storyline....the 9 to 5 listers, often
writing from work approach the discussion in a different way.  when the
discussion are live, unmoderated their is a vitality to the community
that this list will not have as long as we have to wait sometimes 4-5
days for messages to come thru.  then my main reason to read becomes to
remember what was being talked about, rather than to live & discuss from
the comments of others that are that moment in my head.

& list revigoration takes brave souls such as yourself to speak what on
her mind, & perhaps not being too concerned whether folks respond.  Ive
grown accustomed to a response to maybe 5% of my posts, but then my
interests are marginalized by their visual/verbal gesturing.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I'm surprised I didn't see more responses to this come thru my digest
version. I am obsessed with space/time--and have some idea that I'll
actually finish my thesis on it. What I found really informed my writing and
how time occurs was seeing theatre and dance. Specifically (dance) Margaret
Jenkin's "Breathe Normally," (oh, but that's because I'm partial to dance
theatre). I don't perceive time as linear at all, and I often think we just
"think" we are moving through the world chronologically. Certainly memory
doesn't work in this way--Celan's "Breathturn" is a good example of time
functioning differently. As for how theatre informs: the different threads
of time that occur in the same space--the 8-10Pm time, the time the play
inhabits, and the time the characters inhabit all happen in the same space
and probably the same time--if we take the 8-10PM element as structure.
Of course, this is nothing new to poetry (I'm also thinking the cliche
"theatre of the page," whatever that...anyway).
What I am experimenting with in poetry is taking these stage/playwriting
elements and deconstructing them in the way that character/poem and
reader/audience experiences interchange thru the work--that all experiences
essentially exist at the same time, or perhaps they exist simultaneously
thru the theory of parallel universes or time travel (the fourth dimension).
What troubles me now is the irony of assigning the words an order and space
on the page--it seems so static to have to proceed this way.
A book to have a good argument with (if you can abide by its bestseller
status/nonsense) is "Einstein's Dreams" by Alan Lightman--as example of what
not to do. I am partial to the study of black holes, so of course, Stephen
Hawking and then there was that Nova about time travel and bubble theory.

Hi, I'm posting here an invitation that I sent out in the mail to CLMP's
mailing list; if you are an editor of a lit mag and you haven't seen this,
please read.

Thanks,

Rebecca

****



=46eb 1, 2000

Dear Literary Journal Publisher,


We are Jenine Bockman and Rebecca Wolff; the editors, respectively, of
Literal Latt=E6 and Fence. Together we have been working on projects we hope
will improve the literary journal *"industry" (if you can call it that!)*
Specifically, we are concerned with distribution and with visibility. We
hope you will agree that by working together as publishers we can improve
for all of us the public awareness of and appreciation for literary
magazines. To that end, we are launching what we hope will become an annual
event:  the Literary Magazine Fair, to be held in New York City, on April
16th, 2000 at Housing Works Used Bookstore Caf=E6. Housing Works is a
non-profit organization whose proceeds go to support the community of
homeless people with AIDS. This used bookstore/cafe in SoHo has become one
of New York's prime meeting places and literary venues.  *This letter is an
invitation to your journal to participate in the fair and a description of
the event.*

The aim of this Fair is to draw much-needed, much-deserved attention to the
incredible range of journals being produced in this country by independent
and university publishers alike. *The goal of the event is to attract* an
interested reading and general public by hosting a festive and informative
day highlighting the wealth of literary magazines available *in the
country?*. *How??? Jump to the from noon to three section, then go back to
media* Because this is an unusual event for a good cause *(Housing Works
_and_ Literary Magazines or just remind them what the good cause is...) *we
expect to be able to attract the attention of the media, in all its glory.

=46rom noon to three the Fair will be open for browsing, purchasing, and
conversation. *Tell them where their magazine will be- on a table? lining
the book shelves? in a big overflowing bin?* At three the Council of
Literary Magazines and Presses will host a roundtable discussion which will
feature literary magazine editors and artists from other media genres,
including hypertext and film, in a conversation about the future of the
printed word and its relation/relevance to other creative forms. (Topic
subject to change) At five, CLMP, Literal Latt=E6 and Fence will host a
cocktail party reception for publishers and the people who want to meet
them.

The idea of this event is to make journals extremely attractive and
accessible *(to who? this sentence dangles...). Put the media stuff
here?.*All participating journals will offer sample copies for the low, low
price of $2. Our hope is that attendees will be moved to check out a broad
variety of journals. All proceeds from sales will go to Housing Works,
giving readers further incentive to spend their dollars here.

The real support for journals is in subscriptions, and so our hope *(or
"this is a great opportunity for participating mags...to")* is that
participating journals will offer attendees half-price subscription
vouchers (of their own devising). Bringing in new subscribers is the most
time-consuming and expensive part of circulation maintenance: a half-price
subscription now is a full-price renewal later.

If one of your editors attends the Fair, you can send as many sample copies
as you like. If your journal is unable to send an editor to the Fair, you
may still send up to 10 sample copies, as well as a hefty stack of
half-price subscription vouchers. All participants will receive a copy of
the door list. *highlight that they get the list-*

We hope this event is the first of many group efforts. We believe that the
problems literary journals face could be better approached with the force
of a united front. In the future we plan to concentrate our efforts on the
hoary beast of distribution, and we're quite convinced that a group voice
will be more convincing to bookstores and distributors alike.

Please fill out the form below by February 14th to ensure your place at the
=46air. Your check for $15, made out to WordSci, Inc., will help us cover
administrative costs. Because nothing like this has been done before (in
our memory), we need firm commitments from you immediately so that we can
go forward with the logistics of space, organization, etc.

We look forward to hearing from you, and we hope we'll see you at the Fair.

Yikes--I just realized I sent a draft of the letter instead of the final
one. I don't seem to have the final one we sent but the draft gives you the

***What you missed: the last reading was a tense mix of blues, rants & and
plain old bad behavior, as CHRIS STROFFOLINO tossed out the formula to
harangue the audience on the finer points of ambivalence, death & the
Twillight Zone whilst he read some of his juvenalia at twice its normal speed,
while YOLANDA WISHER performed a soulful hybrid of song and poetry,
accompanied by her partner Mark Glassio on upright bass.

8 / THE NIGHT SHOWERS MULTICOLORED SPARKS

The night showers multicolored sparks over the
ark's bow as it
plows through the stars

velvet night night of beneficence night
without equal singular as a pin held straight
up in the dark with its sharp tip

many faces crowd forward to look
the crowd opens a space
the object of their burning eyes and curious faces

earth like a blue jeweled ball suspended in black velvet

velvet night night of beneficence night
without equal night showering
multicolored sparks over the
ark's bow as it
plows through the stars

the cow


i am nikuko. please tell me what your problems are.
after you are done typing, click return twice.

and if I return once to you.
i shall look no further than the truth.
and if I return twice to you
shall the truth be known
by she who sent me forth.
crying from the top of the mountain,
yearning from the valley,
no one ceases to wander.
the cessation of all desire
is the beginning of comprehension
and in such dreary worlds
i will be stone or carving.
you will know me by my shape,
that of signs and symbols in your dreaming,
nothing coming forth, nothing returning,
nothing entering, nothing leaving.
nothing of a jar or fire without smoke,
nothing of a cow or a white horse,
nothing of horses or no-jar, no-fire,
nothing of white, nothing of no-cows.
coming and going, it is all the same,
you arrive where you have always been.
reconcile yourself with all creatures,
lie down with them, caress them,
drain yourself of all desire,
produce them within you.
there is no fear that is groundless,
fear holds the pathway, veering
just above the highest peaks,
beneath the ocean bottoms.
it runs faster than the flood,
higher than any lightning,
louder than any thunder,
it burns through time, white fire,
burns through space, black fire.
nothing can be turned to good effect,
to turn nothing is to do nothing.
to lose oneself is to gain nothing
to gain oneself is to lose nothing.

Subject:      Neo-Essentialists!
In-Reply-To:  <b6.1091719.25d01f92@aol.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As the sole surviving member of the Committee to Develop Polemical
Responses to  Polemical Positions (the carnage, I assure you, was
stupendous), we (I) proudly announce the dissolution of the C.D.P.R.P.P.
and the formation of the Neo-Essentialist Movement.  Our (my) manifesto
appears below.  We (I) thank Jacques and the ongoing Bourdieu discussion
for our (my) inspiration.


NEO-ESSENTIALIST MANIFESTO

1.  The work of art is a machine for the production of life; or, in
Baudelairian terms, an artifice for the alleviation of boredom.  Death
(even and especially the temporary death of thinking) is the only
abstraction which is also universal.  All other abstractions, because they
are encountered in materials, are only negatively universal (that is, to
the degree that they strive to overcome lifelessness).  The essence of the
art work is therefore never any particular way it resists the cessation of
life, but only its trying to do so.

2.  Temporary and falsely-universal essentials are, however, real and
actual during the time they operate for art’s machine.  The assertion that
the essence of art is the production of death, for example, might also be
productively fed into the machine.

3.  A machine is useful only in the way that its products are useful.  If
the machine’s product is “life” then its usefulness can no longer be
reduced to empiricist, pragmatic or otherwise utilitarian systems.  Art is
a machine only in the sense that it is made by human beings.

4.  Anti-essentialism is produced by isolating Spinozian determinism from
its foundational premise.  Spinoza believed that the logic of mathematics
provided the necessary transcendental position for the explanation of human
thought and emotion.  When the logic of power or self-interest (social
reason) takes the place of the logic of mathematics (universal reason), the
logic of mathematics becomes part of what now must be explained. The new
position must presume to be, itself, prior to universal reason.  But, since
universal reason first posited and bounded the idea of essence, this new
determinism therefore needs a non-concept, namely anti-essentialism, as its
new transcendental position.

5.  Neo-essentialism, however, holds that both the logic of mathematics and
the logic of power are products of art.  They have been produced by the
on-going attempts (in all their forms) to flee the absence of life (in all
its forms).

6.  One day, according to Neo-essentialism, it will be clear that using
politics as a measuring category for the value of art only confused cause
with application.  Once life is produced, its application is a matter of
politics.  Without life, there is no such thing as politics.

7.  Irony, which has been consistently misunderstood as a secret language
between adepts or as the rehabilitation of language tainted by its
association with power, is at best a gesture indicating the distance
between thought and its object.  In other words, like any fake essential
irony it is designed to produce the necessary opposition that gives being
its life.

8.  Positions, including the pseudo-positions of fake science, fake
philosophy, fake manifestoes and fake essentials, are likewise real so long
as they separate language-ideas that desire to be invisible in their
togetherness.

9.  The hidden term in dialectics is perversity.  When the description of a
historical or internally-arising contradiction is persuasive, it acceptance
has already been conditioned by the broad desire to create new,
antithetical life in the face of all thesis.

10.  Wittgenstein’s famous last line in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
(“What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence”) has a
Neo-essentialist corollary: “Whatever can be said must be said.”

Signed,
the sole member of the Neo-Essentialist Movement,

Brent Cunningham

Hi Elizabeth,

My sense on why some writing on the list seems "academic" and why these
posts generate response probably has to do with the fact that these posts
promote frames which extend beyond their particular subject matter, whereas
appraisals often remain generally confined to the issue at hand.  However,
my experience is that appraisals, and enthusiastic posts -- I will even say
"happy" and "humorous" posts, positive thinking posts that seem to imply
possibility in poetics rather than limitations -- are often read with great
pleasure, as I know I have read them that way.  As a frequent and often
inconstistent poster -- haranguing one day and trying to say something nice
about a recent work another -- I find that I never get responses to the
posts that approach specific works whereas the ones that take on another
person's frame, usually in an attempt to adjust the frame, maybe even
destroy it, or at least to add peculiar data to the discourse to suggest
places where the frame is limited.  I don't think there's anything terribly
wrong with this; for example, a review posted out of the blue will most
likely not be dropping into an existing thread, and if nobody's particularly
angry about what it says, or intrigued but actually just pleased by it,
there is little need to respond in public (that is, because the review is
not attempting a "frame," it is talking about possiblity).  But I get a fair
amount of backchannels saying "nice review, I'll check out the book."  (I
usually take a cigartette break then.)  I didn't read Wendy's post on
Debbie, but I bet it might have not registered partly because few people
have seen or read the book (the problem with reviews, they discuss books
that people have not yet read, so who can complain?).  I think Debbie is
quite complicated and really interesting and important -- I'd love to write
about it myself -- and Lisa gave a tremendous reading here which, I think
(not to overstate it) literally changed people's lives.  I'd like to know if
anyone experienced the Williams-seeing-the-Duchamp-in-the-Armory-show
feeling about it -- that would be very interesting to me, since I sense that
others in the room felt this (I've known her work for years, so alas I did
not experience this myself, not to say I wasn't impressed).  All sorts of
young poets walked out of that room with their little blue books in hand --
and Lisa's Canadian, which made it doubly interesting since I've wondered
whether New York is not very interested in what's happening elsewhere.
Anyway, I guess my point is that it's hard to guage what gets responses and
why -- it's pretty complicated, but I think can be interesting to think
about from a sociological perspective.  I'd be more humorous now myself, but
I've had a rough day.  Consequently, with the (undestandable) prickliness of
some of readers, and the way that "tone" is often not conveyed completely on
this list and can be mistranslated across cultures -- ranging from
California to New Zealand -- it's hard to inject good wry humor in a post
without possibliy offending someone.  I often think a solution is
"decorousness" rather than "humor" -- i.e. try to write like T.S. Eliot
(with different content, of course), so as not to bother someone intensely.
This may in fact "dull the senses", and it can, indeed, be boring.  Alas!
What to do?

As for censorship, I know for a fact that several emails have simply not
made it due to technological problems the EPC has been having (notice the
new icons?) -- David Bromige, for instance (as he mentioned in one of his
more recent posts), lost a few and was feeling orphaned and lonely, and I
lost a few myself (my best writing!).  Maintaining a server can be quite
hellish, I know from experience, and we often don't appreciate the effort
these guys make to keep the thing alive.  So at least, on occasion, it's not
censorship, though I felt that's what was happening to me.  (I don't know
what Kent has to say, I don't have the issue.)

I don't quite know how to discuss gender in a productive manner myself,
ditto for race -- I prefer social experiments rather than discourse in that
instance.  (I'm playing Yoko Ono in an upcoming Kevin Killian play in New
York, for example -- that'll be a trip, got to get my greatest hits CD out!)
It's too prickly for me, and I'm afraid people would take me for a "native
informer", or at least get confused in the tangle of ironies I have erected
for myself when talking about this.  I had a pleasant experience yesterday,
though, at an Eric Gamalinda reading (he's a Filipino poet whom I've known
for a while).  I had thought someone we were talking to was Japanese, but
she was Filipino, and so she asked me, "Are _you_ Japanese?" and I said,
"No, I'm Korean," and then (very jokingly, it was _humor_, "I hate
Japanese."  This was, of course, a reference to the colonization of Korea by
Japan, which few non-Asians seem to know about.  Eric, not missing a beat,
looked up from the book he was signing and said, in a fake-fatherly voice,
"Now now, that's all in the past!"  In other words, he totally got what I
meant, but I think in another context it would have brought dead silence,
discomfort, etc.   I call this a "pleasant experience" since, the "avant
garde" culture in New York being pretty monotone in terms of race (which
never really bothered me, just concerns me a bit), and it was nice to share
that kind of joke.

Anyway, gotta run.

Yours,
Brian




More censorious questions or why I generally lurk.
        Why does the discourse have to be so - to put it politely -
academic? Is
this really the only way to be rigorous? What about the rigor of humor?
David Hess posted a piece about a Gertrude Stein conference to this List
some time ago in which he made his points with big tasty dollops of
hilarity. Hoa Nguyen, who later printed the piece in _Skanky Possum_ (issue
#2 i think) mentioned backchannel to me the profound silence with which this
was met, listside. From my early days on the list, I also recall fondly
Wendy Kramer's happy post on Lisa Robertson's _Debbie: An Epic_, in which
she rendered both a scan of the scene at a reading Robertson gave in New
York and her own reading of _Debbie_ with an enthuisasm at once intricate
and flip, like a flower. Alas such pleasures are few and far between.  Is it
the nature of listservs to dull the senses? Are we to believe high
seriousness to be the only argot that translates on email? (I work at Kmart
so I don't have to talk like that. A joke.)  (A joke is offensive. -- My
fake Gertrude Stein quote.)

sent with good wishes, Elizabeth

Has my memory failed me or is it not the case that Henry Gould
dropped off the list himself?  As far as I remember (and I wasn't
paying much attention) he was not kicked off or censored.  After
zillions of people begged both on the list and backchannel to the
administration for Henry to not post so many messages each day, but
to combine his messages, he left the list.  There was no censorship
of content here.  It was a mass appeal by hundreds of people who felt
bombarded and harassed by HG's excessive number of posts.

I was never involved in any of the Henry stuff and I have no bad
feelings against him, but this developing issue of his martyrdom is
smoke without fire.

What Susan Howe thinks of the list is Susan's business and shouldn't
be taken as any reflection of the list.

I think Charles, Joel Kuszai, and now Chris have done a wonderful,
apparently thankless job here.  And all three of them has been
supportive of my own experiments into gender hysteria.

i've made a couple of sculptural pieces to deal with, work with, against this
static...not sure if they actually do, but i think they do...open fixed poems
to new ideas, new vistas.

one project: a poem in 4 voices, not necessarily speaking in a particular
order, demanded to be moved into something more fluid, less time-dependent or
one-after-the-next. it became...a mobile, with stanzas hanging in certain
patterns to indicate placement on the page...but, by hanging, and by the
structure as a whole (rather than positioning) being the main focus, the poem
becomes much more free of the page-constraint and open to the reader's
interaction with it, the poem, the structure, the little motions the wind
makes as the reader moves around to read...freed from linear time, put into
motion...

the other, a cart or wagon w/boxes the reader/viewer has to open to see
what's inside--the cart also has words on it, and the boxes must be removed
fr the cart to see what the cart says. the boxes are numbered, but don't
require sequential reading; they are varying heights, non-sequentially, to
further disrupt the idea of order; and inside each box are visual delights,
little art/art on a small scale, almost like a frozen moment, time capsule,
small world, accompanied by a poem (on a transparency, across the inside top
of the box). the cart has functioning wheels and a rope w/a handle, and can
be pulled...say, perhaps into a new perspective...
(this project was collaborative, the structural ideas and creation largely
done by a sculptor friend of mine, jill koetke.) (the mobile, assistance from
my andy hilliard, or i'd still be tangled up with fishing wire...)

thought you might be interested.

It may be that e-listers-- enjoying (or not enjoying) distribution of text
messages to all members + archives -- may need to step cautiously into
"live" conferencing on the net to supplement their communications with one
another.

It is possible to set up voice (and/or text) conferencing on Firetalk
software (it's a free download) -- with various levels of constraint on
entry & membership.
    I've recently tried Firetalk -- I dont love it, but it seems to work &
might be useful as a supplement or alternative --

--  it might alleviate some of the concerns voiced by Elizabeth Treadwell,
Karen Kelley & mIEKAL aND   (tho a mixed men/women Forum would probably not
make any difference to gender-balance)

The Philadelphia  Writers' House  video on the net was interesting &
enjoyable but, nevertheless had a built-in division between panellists &
others. Participation from outside remained as : Questions directed to
Panellists.

This was supposed to be a surprise, Brian!

As part of Kevin's reading this Wednesday (Feb. 16) at the
Threadwaxing Space, Brian,Eileen Myles, and others will help Kevin
act out a scene from his play "The Vegetable Kingdom," a spoof of
vegetarianism and diva rivalry.

...we parry one another's sublimations as though each judgment
represented bankable property (Bourdieu). I oppose the reading that
transposes itself into a critique to a participatory or performative
reading. It is also curious, as Brian Stefans points out, that the
reading that evokes response seems always someone else's judgment rather
than their fret work, work with syllables and and other signifying bits.

Gender seems to have an awful lot to do with this. The standard mode of
modern poetry seems to be one of objectifying subjectivities. And it may
be indelicate to talk about subjectivites, but claims to objectivity are
always fair game. This objectifying mode resonates with many male gender
traits: those sublimations that go to the furthest extremes to mark the
structures that constitute territorial claims, to denial of the
pleasures that alpha males take from chiding one another, to scopophilia
(perhaps a perverse pleasure in witnessing another's pain).

I do not write as I write either to contest notions of gender or to mock
them. It's fairly obvious that most of us guys on the list would not
want to advocate for silence as an inherent female trait (although we
may in our individual perversities fetishize such silences -- surely we
have produced enough theories on the topic), and so indeed here again I
am myself attempting to speak for her .... as perhaps too many men
before me have done.

Martha Ronk asked me to post this to the poetics list in case anyone is in
the LA area and would like to attend.  Anyone who attends, of course, is also
allowed to be a respondent, but it looks funny the way it is stated below.  I
think, for example, I am allowed to be a respondent only because I agreed to
post this to the list.  There was a list of questions circulating that didn't
seem to get into my last email from Martha.  One of them asks people to
discuss whether or not the quotidian is representable, visualizable,
neccessarily imagistic, etc...another asks whether or not it can be used to
undermine notions of the author as genius.


Poetry Conference: The Quotidian

From: Dennis Phillips and Martha Ronk

<italic>The quotidian, in terms of writing, can be taken in at least two
ways: the first, the more literal, is an engagement, in one way or
another, with the items, textures, events, etc., of everyday life.  The

This is to invite you to a one-day conference on "the quotidian" in
contemporary poetry to be held at Occidental College on Saturday, March 4
from 10-5.  The panelists will be Norma Cole,

Brenda Hillman and Michael Palmer from San Francisco, and Dennis
Phillips, Martha Ronk, and Paul Vangelisti from Los Angeles.  The
respondents will be poets and critics Guy Bennett, Dan Fineman, Rob
Kaufman, Standard Schaefer, and Diane Ward.  All who attend will be
encouraged to participate and address questions related to the quotidian
and poetry.  We have put the presentations of poetry and more discursive
statements together in order
to allow each to comment on the other more fully.


The structure of the day:

9:00-9:30 coffee

9:30-12:30: introduction, reading, panel, discussion

12:30--2: lunch available in the student dining hall

2-4:30: reading, panel, discussion

4:30-6: informal reception


The conference will take place in the Salisbury Room on the second floor
of the Johnson Student Center  (which also houses the bookstore and
eating facilities).  Occidental College is in Eagle Rock  at 1600 Campus
Road, Los Angeles 90041. Directions to the college and the buildings can
be obtained by calling the switchboard: 323 259 2500 or by going to the
Occidental WEB page (Oxy.edu).  Parking is easily available in areas
adjacent to the Student Center.

Subject:      a heart-shaped rose or my dinner with henry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

[Dear all, FYI, this is my reply to a long backchannel from Henry Gould, who
read my posts on the archive (hey, it's a free country, eh). Anyhow, feel
free to skip OBVIOUSLY.  heart shaped roses to yall, ET]


Dear Henry, First off, I hope you are having a good Valentine's Day. It's
raining here, but pleasant. (I think we all tend to forget to be civil over
email, sometimes -- this is not directed at you, just an explanation for why
I don't get straight to the point.)  I hadn't even realized all that was
already back in Nov. 98. Time (and times) fly.

I probably shouldn't have even mentioned Kent's article in my post, as it
gets things all confused again. I simply wanted to bring up the issue of
gender(ed?) censorship, which it seems to me is too ephemeral a substance to
be borne by one tyrant (CB, CA, Joel K [hi Joel! rock on!] or whomever) or
one scapegoat (you or whomever). Why do men talk more in class, at cocktail
parties, etc? Women are colluding in this no doubt. And sometimes it's not
true either (aka not happening). But I really believe on this list (which is
hardly "mine") a culture has grown wherein men (and a few of them at that)
dominate, many many fine female poets I know and know of have given up on
the conversation, etc. That's where Susan Howe fits in to what I am trying
to say.

>
>Third, I don't see what Susan Howe's opinions of your list have to do with
>Kent's assertions.  Kent was suggesting that I was singled out because
>I was an ideological troublemaker.

What they have to do with Kent's assertions is that there is a gender
imbalance on the list which has to do with this hard-to-pin-down type of
censorship, and frankly I find that very compelling and important and of
concern; and I don't know why the "conflagration" turned out to be all about
you. It's unfortunate in many ways. I have tried to bring my concerns up on
the list before, including during the "conflagration", but somehow it's
being written into cyberhistory as about one male voice being silenced
rather than multiple female voices. And I don't think anyone should be silenced.

[Women speaking at all in some spots is ideological troublemaking.]

Well, that's about all I have the energy for. I hear only good things about
you from folks who know you, and I wish you all the best.

My regards,
Elizabeth

I'm curious about how people --- the audience, so to speak --- actually
perceive things like this.  Do their linear habits override everything?
How do people learn to break such habits?  How can the work teach them?

(and yes I know the answers depend on "which people?" which doesn't stop me

Whether or not this is true, Richard, a good look at the way things go down in poetryland
is useful in taking the next step. For a poet, anyway. I would rather understand the whole
story than pretend it doesn't exist. Lots of poets sound like they're pushing a particular
poetical commodity. In other words, they sound like salespeople. Perhaps rousing and
eloquent salespeople, but salespeople all the same. And often they don't see that, they
figure they're on about something else. How can you be honest when you don't know what
you're doing? So I think that a good look into these things is useful.

There have been many accusations of "censorship" on this  list --
specifically against the list moderators -- all of which I have found
disingenuous. From having observed the "Henry Gould events" on this list I
do not believe that Charles Bernstein or Joel Kuszai "censored" anyone, so
I'm with Dodie on this one. If CB or JK contacted listees about the number
of their posts, that does not constitute "censorship," and it was within
their rights as list owners and moderators, and further, was for the benefit
of the entire list community. I think people should be more careful about
what kind of accusations they make, and be sure that there is ample evidence
to support said accusation.
Thanks,
Kathy Lou

There once was a langpo named Rosa
Whose "identity" never came closer
Than to fuck with Ms Stein
As if from behind
viz. Rose a is rose a is rose a.


>>>More censorious questions or why I generally lurk.
        Why does the discourse have to be so - to put it politely - academic? Is
this really the only way to be rigorous? What about the rigor of humor?
David Hess posted a piece about a Gertrude Stein conference to this List
some time ago in which he made his points with big tasty dollops of
hilarity. Hoa Nguyen, who later printed the piece in _Skanky Possum_ (issue
#2 i think) mentioned backchannel to me the profound silence with which this
was met, listside. From my early days on the list, I also recall fondly
Wendy Kramer's happy post on Lisa Robertson's _Debbie: An Epic_, in which
she rendered both a scan of the scene at a reading Robertson gave in New
York and her own reading of _Debbie_ with an enthuisasm at once intricate
and flip, like a flower. Alas such pleasures are few and far between.  Is it
the nature of listservs to dull the senses? Are we to believe high
seriousness to be the only argot that translates on email? (I work at Kmart
so I don't have to talk like that. A joke.)  (A joke is offensive. -- My
fake Gertrude Stein quote.)

sent with good wishes, Elizabeth

Subject: Re: gender again

The standard mode of
modern poetry seems to be one of objectifying subjectivities.
*I don't think this generalization holds up to much scrutiny. It's
certainly not the standard mode in the modern poetry that I've been devoted
to, in which the constant grafting and reconfiguration of subjectivity and
revealing of processes of formulating the subject are a near-obsession.  Is
it bc I have a post-modernist perspective on this poetry? I don't think so.
A more interesting question: is it bc much of this poetry is from East
Asia (in my case, shorthand for metropolitan China, Japan, and Korea)?
Again, no, but interesting all the same bc it is a shibboleth of much
modern E. Asian literary criticism that (a) modern subjectivity was
introduced as a result of Western influence [the translation and adaptation
of romanticism, naturalism, romantic realism (e.g. Dostoevsky), symbolism,
high modernism, futurism, expressionism, surrealism, fascism, etc. all
within 40 years of each other] and (b) that the West was peculiarly
"objectifying" as opposed to the more supposedly spiritual,
subjectivity-oriented approaches of Asian aesthetics and ideology.  In its
more debased forms this dogma has resulted in two particularly deadening or
treacherous schools of thought: (i) the assumption that Asian literature is
always trying to CATCH UP TO THE WEST (corollary: China and Korea were
trying to catch up to Japan) and (ii) nativist, sometimes fascist (e.g.
Japan during the late 30's-1945), views that Asian cultures must RETURN TO
their subjective and aesthetic basis, their "true feelings," although the
ironies & contradictions abound once the argument proceeds (e.g., this
spiritualism was supposedly due to the race's or ethnicity's material
"blood," Heidegger and Kierkegaard were deep influences on some of these
nativists, metropolitan nativists quickly realized they had no native
culture to return to, it didn't stop nativists from aspiring to be
objectifying imperialists, etc.). Literary critics like Karatani Kojin
(_The Origins of Modern Japanese Literature_) have tried to upend this type
of thinking, but it remains.

In any case, one cannot help but agree that there are ways in which
modernity's particular forms of objectification can be delineated and
criticized (tens of thousands of pages have been/continue to be written on
it), but to do so without consideration of modernity's constant instigation
and displacement of/need for subjectivity is not very helpful.  Foucault
blah blah blah, but the early Marx also had much to say abt this and he
phrased it in terms of the development of separated State (public,
political) and Civic (private, egoistic) realms of society, mutually
founded and deepening alienation, democracy thriving on the proliferation
of self-seeking hucksters who do not aspire to revolution, etc.  In such a
situation, how cd much of modern poetry NOT work "against" (as in against
the grain, rather than in total dichotomous oppostion to) the
objectification of subjectivity? Its "release" of it both dissolves and
sustains modernity.  But not just another opium for (a small number of) the
people?

And it may
be indelicate to talk about subjectivites, but claims to objectivity are
always fair game.
*But doesn't the subjectivity game also have its own constantly resorted-to
"fair" moves?

This objectifying mode resonates with many male gender
traits: those sublimations that go to the furthest extremes to mark the
structures that constitute territorial claims, to denial of the
pleasures that alpha males take from chiding one another, to scopophilia
(perhaps a perverse pleasure in witnessing another's pain).
*I dunno--thazza pretty good beginning for a list of characteristics of the
women (and queer men, since we're talking gender, not genitals here, or are
we--alpha males??) I wish I'd never crossed paths w, some of whom make a
living off of various poetry corpses, sometimes a very good living.

I do not write as I write either to contest notions of gender or to mock
them.
*Nor to praise or bury them, etc.

It's fairly obvious that most of us guys on the list would not
want to advocate for silence as an inherent female trait
*But WOULD advocate the set of male "traits" you give above? Or were you
not implying that these are inherent?  Sorry--maybe I ignored something
relevant in the beginning of this thread.

(although we
may in our individual perversities fetishize such silences -- surely we
have produced enough theories on the topic), and so indeed here again I
am myself attempting to speak for her .... as perhaps too many men
before me have done.
*Sorry to repeat the footnotes of countless cultural studies articles, but:
Can the subaltern speak?  Gayatri Spivak's probing of this question is
complex, copiously cited, but still as needed and relevant here as ever.

I agree that Elizabeth's recent postings have been refreshing.  I further
agree, am very interested in, the idea that humor, levity, joy can be
intellectual and even political work.  And that we should be able to find
ways to write about poetics that are thoughtful but not alienating.  (This
is not to say I think people should stop posting the kinds of things they
post -- I enjoy the really difficult postings sometimes.  I just think an
alternative would be also, simultaneously, nice.)

And I'm really wondering about how this relates, if it does, to the idea
of women posting not as much to the list.  I'm currently working on an
essay about Barbara Guest which looks at her use of humor as a feminist
strategy.  I wonder if a percieved lack of humor in some of the postings
ends up making people feel excluded rather than included.  I don't
know...I'm just wondering.  I know I always appreciate a sense of warmth,
of humor, in posts...esp Alan Sondheim's poems, in Elizabeth's posts, in
the tone of Maria Damon's posts.

I think maybe we should just keep thinking about how to expand the ways
we write about the things we write about on this list.

Group Reading and Ornithological Show Celebrate Another Issue of Poetry,
Fiction, etc.

When:           Thursday, February 24, 2000, at 7:30pm.
Where:          New College, Blue Books, 766 Valencia
How Much:       $5, or $10 if you buy the magazine

In honor of the launch of its Spring, 2000 issue, 6,500, a magazine of
poetry, fiction, and drawings of men and women in sweatshirts, will release
6,500 pigeons into the auditorium of New College on Thursday, February
24th. The event is believed to be the largest-ever release of birds into an
enclosed space (10,000 doves were to be set free at the coronation of King
Edward VIII, but the King abdicated before the ceremony could be held, and
his successor, George VI, a confirmed bird-hater, had the doves shipped to
the North of England, where they eventually played a minor but dramatic
role in the Battle of Britain).

6,500 editor Katie Degentesh explains: "Pigeons and poetry are two images
of the same thing: the desire to move freely in three dimensions while
living in a place with lots of people. Pigeons are the poets of the air."
The birds will swoop, coo, and eat pinto beans as poets Sarah Anne Cox,
Katie Degentesh, Abie Hadjitarkhani, Alex Green, Jan Richman, Tarin Towers
and Elizabeth Treadwell read from their recent work.  Writer Paul LaFarge
will provide fictional accompaniment through a microphone.

After the reading, copies of the magazine will be made available for the
modest price of $8, and well-wishers will enjoy the sight of pigeon
wrangler John Ratliffe removing the birds from the ceiling with a non-toxic
solvent of his own invention. The magazine will then be distributed to fine
bookstores nationwide, and the pigeons will be set free in Oakland, as
their former San Francisco roosts are converted into live/work spaces for
parakeets.

For more information on 6,500, e-mail 6500@paraffin.org or

Brian and any interested others:

Those of you who don't have the Skanky Possum issue with the
"Buffalo ' 99" article can find it at
http://webdelsol.com/FLASHPOINT

It's my understanding that one of the FlashPoint editors tried to
post a notice of the article's availability a couple of weeks ago.
Perhaps this notice never appeared for the reasons you mention
above. In any case, I think maybe Dodie Bellamy's confusion about
certain issues of principle involved in le affaire Henri would be
lessened if she had the chance to read the piece-- or at least read
it again and reflect with more care on the sequence and meaning of
events involved.

By the way, and since I interviewed him in part regarding it, Henry
Gould's book Stubborn Grew is recently out from Spuyten Duyvil.
It's quite extraordinary.

it's an ancient truism, that advertisers use sex to sell..more or less
everything;  (and of course clever intellectuals have also been saying for
the last couple of decades, that while our culutre has become more open
about sex than it used to be, the one thing it is considered "obscene" and
unallowable to talk about, is death...);

so now some advertising firm has hit on what must (in some ways) be the
first truely original idea of the new millenium:  advertising that
explioits, not sex but death

just what the hell do the people on death row SAY in these ads, i wonder?

HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill., Feb 17
                         (Reuters) - Sears, Roebuck and Co. , the second
largest U.S. retailer, said it would stop sales of Benetton USA apparel
and remove the products from its stores. Benetton, through its United
Colors of Benetton stores, recently introduced an advertising campaign
called "We, on Death Row" that features interviews with convicted killers.
Sears said on Wednesday it objected strongly to the advertising as soon as
it became aware of the campaign, and it began reviewing its legal options
regarding its contract with Benetton. Missouri's attorney general has sued
Benetton for alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in gaining access to
four inmates in its state prison, and Britain's non-broadcast advertising
watchdog has said it would investigate complaints about the campaign.
Earlier this week, Benetton defended the controversial campaign, insisting
that its aim the to foster debate, not to boost sales.

                         The merchandise is designed by
                         Benetton, a unit of Milan-based Benetton
                         Group SpA , and manufactured by a third
                         party. Benetton USA merchandise has
                         been carried in 400 Sears stores since
                         last autumn.

                         Sears, with annual revenue of $41 billion,
                         operates more than 850 full-line
                         department stores and 2,100 specialized
                         retail stores and offers some
                         merchandise online.

** This Week in the Big Church Room ** Franklin & Geary ** San Francisco **

THE POETRY CENTER & AMERICAN POETRY ARCHIVES
Presents

A memorial tribute to
EDWARD DORN
Thursday, February 17, 7:30 pm, free
@ The Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin (at Geary)
San Francisco

With special guests GORDON BROTHERSTON, BOB CALLAHAN, TOM CLARK, STEPHEN
EMERSON, JOANNE KYGER, DUNCAN McNAUGHTON, and TOM RAWORTH.

EDWARD DORN, who died on the 10th of this past December at his home in
Denver, will be remembered by a gathering of friends this evening in San
=46rancisco.  Born in 1929 in Eastern Illinois, Mr. Dorn attended Black
Mountain College during the 1950s and would come to prominence with the
publication of several remarkable early poems in Donald Allen's renowned
anthology The New American Poetry.

His many books published over four decades in the US and the UK include The
Collected Poems 1956-1974 (Four Seasons, Bolinas, 1975), the novel The
Rites of Passage (Frontier Press, Buffalo, 1965), later issued as By the
Sound, the long dramatic narrative poem Gunslinger, issued serially, and
eventually collected in 1975 (Berkeley, Wingbow Press), Recollections of
Gran Apacheria (Turtle Island, San Francisco, 1974), and several volumes of
translations from Spanish, Portuguese, and Native American languages, done
with Gordon Brotherston, and recently collected in the volume The Sun
Unwound: Original Texts from Occupied America (North Atlantic Books,
Berkeley, 1999).

". . . The mission bells are ringing
in Kansas.
Have you left something out.
Negative, says my Gunslinger,
no _thing_ is omitted."

Book Description
 Rarely has . . . a series [been] so consistently strong. Men on Men has
regularly yielded a trove of well-wrought gay-themed short
fiction."-Publishers Weekly

Now spanning eight volumes and two decades, the Men on Men series =
continues
to showcase the remarkable talent of gay literary writers. These venerable
collections of short stories have become a gay literary institution,
launching the careers of several, now luminary, writers-including Joe
Keenan, Christopher Bram, Dale Peck, and David Leavitt. True to its
tradition, Men on Men 2000 brings bright new literary talent together with
established writers-such as Edmund White and Brian Bouldrey-to offer a
poignant collection of gay fiction that is provocative and illuminating at
every turn. This diverse group of voices etches an indelible portrait of =
gay
life at the dawn of the twenty-first century, addressing issues such as
identity and gender stereotypes, the power of love, the lingering shadow =
of
AIDS, and the new adventure of fatherhood.

"Captures the full spectrum of gay life in America today . . United by its
quality rather than its  queerness."-Genre


>From Kirkus Reviews
Men on Men is, as its editors point out, ``the longest running series in =
gay
literature.'' Its longevity may in part be explained by the high standard
the annual volumes have maintained; its persistence also has something to =
do
with the way that the anthologies have skillfully reflected the emergence =
of
new themes in gay literature. Among those on display this year is a new
emphasis on the experience of homosexuality among working-class =
adolescents
and young men, represented in particularly strong tales like Kelly
McQuain's  "Erasing Sonny" and Bill Gordon's ``Home.''  Another intriguing
trend is the attention gay writers are paying to the ways in which popular
culture shapes how young people come to terms with their sexuality, =
explored
in the moving ``Scarecrow,'' by Tom House, and in the unsettling
``Boulevard,'' by Jim Grimsley, among others. Of course, other themes are
persistent: Richard McCann's ``The Universe, Concealed'' is a profoundly
moving meditation on AIDS and the gay community, and David Vernon's
``Arrival'' is a deft study of the way in which two old friends try to =
avoid
dealing with their knowledge of mortality. Another first-rate collection,
impressively varied and strong: an excellent road-map to themes and voices
in gay literature.

 NIKUKO

 NIKUKO, video, VHS from digital/hi8: Nikuko, the famous Russian ballet
 dancer, pirouettes for Doctor Leopold Konninger. These and other avatars
 from the Internet play out stuctures of language, body/movement, and
 desire. A sourceless hunger pervades the work (which may be one work or
 many), created half in, half out, of cyberspace. We are all lost ghosts,
 discovering and abandoning language. Dance stutters or shudders among
 bodies. Pirouetting continues obsessively. All of us walk out of the
 tape, in one or another way, the beautiful styles of the day.

 Foofwa d'Imobilite was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company for
 7 years. He has been performing his multimedia work (dance, text and
 video) in New York and Europe. Azure Carter is currently working in video
 in New York. Alan Sondheim works online, in multimedia, and text/sound/
 video.

 Thanks to the Experimental Television Center in New York for a 1999 resi-
 dency; this work would not have been possible without it.

I don't think people *say* anything in the ads. Usually they are just
visual images.

Benetton actually started the "death advertising" a good few years back
with an image of a man dying of AIDS.

Cynical as the use of deathrow inmates for advertising may be--maybe it's a
good thing to humanize that whole situation. I don't imagine Sears is
pulling the ads 'cause they feel them to be in poor taste, but because they
don't want their buyers (presumably pro-death penalty, since I guess a
majority of Americans are) to feel uncomfortable or guilty.

And I wonder whether the Benetton ads represent the racial disparity of
death row??

The list was out of service yesterday afternoon
due to a power outage. The entire town of Amherst,
New York, which includes UB's north campus, lost
electrical power for about 20 minutes - long enough
to "knock out" the email and other servers, which
then required close to a day's labor to restore.

     Here's a more in-depth article on this issue I pulled from the Lamp of
     Hope list (they are a death row abolitionist group based out of
     Texas):



     Sears pulls Benetton contract after ad flap



     CHICAGO (AP) _ Benetton's latest ad campaign featuring death row
     inmates has unraveled a financial deal between the trendy Italian
     sportswear manufacturer and Sears, Roebuck and Co.
     The ads, which began appearing in magazines and on billboards last
     month, display portraits of American death row inmates in prison
     uniforms and the slogan "Sentenced to Death." The ads give the
     inmate's name, date of birth, crime and expected method of execution.
     Benetton officials said the ads were meant to raise awareness about
     the death penalty, but victims' rights groups said the ads glorified
     convicted killers and were insensitive to victims' families and
     friends.

     On Wednesday, groups picketed a Houston Sears store and Benetton's New
     York office. Hours later, Sears announced it would immediately pull
     Benetton-designed clothing from all 400 of its stores that have been
     selling the Benetton USA line.  Sears chairman and chief executive
     Arthur C. Martinez was "outraged" at the ads, company spokesman Tom
     Nicholson said. "The advertising campaign was inconsistent with what
     Sears has come to stand for and is inconsistent with the customer base
     we serve," Nicholson said.  The contract was canceled even though
     Benetton agreed to allow Sears to preview future ads. Sears has been
     weighing its decision to terminate the contract since it learned the
     content of the ads in early January, Nicholson said.
     "We have been hearing from people who have lost loved ones to some of
     the folks who have been profiled," Nicholson said. "It's reopened
     wounds and brought back a lot of painful memories and people are hurt
     by it." Benetton spokesman Mark Major did return a telephone call
     seeking comment.

     Earlier Wednesday, he said Benetton stood by its ads and believed it
     had succeeded in "launching a national and global discussion on
     capital punishment." The ad campaign also features a 96-page
     supplement entitled, "We, On Death Row," offering question-and-answer
     interviews with the inmates about their hopes, dreams and fears. The
     supplement begins with an essay by an advocacy group opposing capital
     punishment. Benetton made headlines recently with provoking ads that
     addressed such topics as AIDS, the refugee crisis in Kosovo and
     racism. It also prompted protests from the Roman Catholic Church in
     the 1990s for ads featuring models dressed as a priest and a nun who
     were kissing.

     Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, introduced the
     Benetton USA clothing line last fall to help boost lagging clothing
     sales. Benetton made that line exclusively for Sears and continued to
     sell its United Colors of Benetton clothing in its own stores.

Subject:      objectifying subjectivities
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

... aside from the ironies of my posy on gender, intended and othewise,
I'd appreciate an extended discussion on the notion of "objectifying
subjectivities" that I brought up there and which Walter Lew has begun
to unravel.

I'll offer an encrypted bit of reasoning. I more or less take my phrase
to account for  Olson's parading often of his subjectivity whilst
attempting to avoid "lyric interference" by objectification. I believe
his stance is in fact consistent with the modernist stance at large and
that to an extent much lang po is also consistent with this standard of
objectification, My Life," My Poetry." It does seem also that there are
many post-modern schemes afoot to both elicit and objectify various
forms of "interference" -- to give it form on the space of the page or
to observe the twists of its syntax is to my mind an objectification.
One difference between the modernist stance versus the post, might
simply be whether or not the objectification reveals some coherent form
... (or necessary tendency, or ....). The enthusiasm for any
interference that might obtrude itself seems to me part of a pomo
zeit-geist and I suppose I am Freudian enough (or Deleuzian ...) to feel
that the enthusiasm for uncensored bits of interference stems from those
bits being overdetermined. I also happen to think that they are
overdetermined differently because of gender (which is a social
construction, etc ....)

... so I just don't believe in a naked poetry or that poets today of one
or another pomo persuasion are more or less managing to be genuinely
subjective. ... nor do I imply that one gender is better able to
approach subjectivity than the other, although males are perhaps not as
aware of the crucial role that it can play.

whoa kent.  i didn't notice dodie expressing "confusion."  she was very
clear in her opinions and her articulation of them, as always is.  she,
like many of us, have an understanding of what has gone down on the list
that differs from yours.  speaking of gender, your rhetorical device of
attributing confusion to a woman who has a different perspective from yours
is a wonderful case in point vis a vis the gender issues raised here by
elizabeth, dodie, etc.  it is a classic of what's called "condescension,"
or "belittlement," or "marginalization" of a female voice. would you have
used the term "confusion" and exhorted, say, jacques d or charles b etc to
read more carefully had they disagreed with your account or interpretation
of an event?  when a woman disagrees with you, it is not because she
weak-minded.  it is because she has surveyed the same evidence and come to
a different conclusion.

To A.C.G. & List:

And what about the perception of humor?

Sometimes it's not an easy procedure with some people. Take for example
Beckett's line...insisting on the significance of "line" in ENDGAME: "nothing
is funnier than unhappiness." What about the often cruel...which has aspects
of gallows humor in it?

Characters crammed into dustbins...or funeral urns...or buried up to their
necks can be products of a comic vision...or indicate for others a
fundamental despondency about the human condition...

I have found the authentic laughter that precipitates from a well-forged
combo of both.

Best,

Gerald

obscure design of dream or destiny--at the moment an order compensates

struggle in frustrated  incomprehension, really dumb, often, for what seems
like a very long time.
          But eventually, if I am successful in learning something, (i.e. I
get to be assured & competent) I can no longer understand how I could ever
have been uncomprehending.
        What actually effects changes of this kind is not always readily
identifiable, caught as it is in too many variable factors.  In seminar
classes, as in therapy, changes sought rationally occur by seeming unsought
chance-like occurrences.
        It is not clear to me that art-works consciously designed &
engineered to change a particular kind of thinking, even with attached long
essays  --  i.e. much expanded labels or titles, necessarily succeed in
doing so.  They might well produce aversion or irritation, which is a not
infrequent response to didacic intentions in the arts.

        In the end, I'm puzzled too.  I would like to know whether you think
artworks do teach & how?

Hi Everybody,

Page 321 of my copy of Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography is missing. Has
anybody seen it?

On Elmo's World, in the episode in which Elmo is a cowboy, does the cactus
he lassoes say, "Nice ropin', Cowboy Elmo!" or  "Good ropin', Cowboy Elmo!"?

God told me to eat a stuffed pork chop and drink champagne before going to
bed. What was God thinking?

Thanks,

Pete

RIDING THE MERIDIAN--WOMEN AND TECHNOLOGY AT DEFIB
Sunday February 6, Noon Pacific Time (20:00 GMT)
Defib: http://www.webartery.com/defib/index.htm

The new issue of Riding The Meridian
(http://www.heelstone.com/meridian), edited by Jennifer Ley, Carolyn
Guertin, CK Tower, and Marjorie Luesebrink is the subject of discussion
this week at Defib, webartery.com's web-based chat forum. I hope that
you will join us in polylogue about this landmark publication.

RIDING THE MERIDIAN
Riding the Meridian's Women and Technology issue (released February 15,
2000) features a round table discussion including professors and
theorists N. Katherine Hayles and Marjorie Perloff, Eastgate aquisitions
editor Diane Greco, and hypertext writers Shelley Jackson and Linda
Carroli, a Progressive Dinner Party showcasing 39 of the leading women
in hypertext web work created by Marjorie Luesebrink and contributing
editor, Carolyn Guertin [with commentary by Hayles and Talan Memmott],
and new work by Johanna Drucker, Sue Thomas, Ruth Daigon, Claudia
Grinnell and Claire Dinsmore, to name just a few. Guertin also examines
the underpinings of the upcoming Eastgate release Califia, by M.D.
Coverley and Adriene Jenik introduces us to her interactive Desktop
Theatre experiments, while CK Tower (editor of Conspire, which will
feature a concurrent issue dedicated to women who write) interviews
Daniela Gioseffi, and Judy Malloy talks to Jennifer Ley about her online
conference dedicated to Gender and Identity in New Media.

JENNIFER LEY
Founder of the hypertext poetry site The Astrophysicist's Tango Partner
Speaks and the internet literary magazine Riding the Meridian, much of
Jennifer Ley's newest literary work is in the field of hypertext.
Examples can be found on the web at the trAce anthology: My Millennium,
in Cauldron and Net, in the upcoming issue of frAme, and in past issues
of The Animist, Snakeskin and Conspire. Her newest work, the Body
Politic, was shown at Digital Arts and Culture '99, sponsored by Georgia
Tech and the University of Bergen - Norway. A 1998 Pushcart nominee,
some of the literary magazines and anthologies that have published Ms.
Ley's poetry include: Agnieszka's Dowry, Terrain, Salt River Review,
Will Work for Peace, Octavo, 2River View, Recursive Angel, Silhouettes
in the Electric Sky and Wise Woman's Web, among many others. Her work is
anthologized at Poetry Cafe.

DEFIB
You're invited to participate/collaborate in this live chat session
which, like the rest of the Defib Web artist interviews, is recorded and
turned into a hypertranscript of the show. Past shows are available at
http://webartery.com/defib/pastevents.htm

TECH REQ
All you need is a Java-enabled browser pointed at
http://webartery.com/defib/index.htm to participate. Or mIRC or Ircle,
etc (see Help section in Defib for details) if you prefer to use a
traditional IRC client.

I noticed something interesting today.  I was reading a book of essays
on psychology.  There was a pretty even split of male and female
authors, but all of the women began their piece by explaining their
background, experience, credentials, and/or education.  This was not
true of the men.  Is this a singular phenomenon in psychology or is it
also true of literature?  If generally true I'm not sure what to make of
it.

"This essay is as vital as Olson's Projective Verse / Human Universe twins,
if quieter, quieter as befits the lateness of the hour.  The proposition
that our poetry is to make conversation possible once more, is a pragmatics
of intuition, that first we have to figure how to write, ground up.  Love is
the question, since we are the answer.  She finds such force in words,
exemplary in her quick listening.  You can't read it just once, life's too
brief.  You can read it forever."  -- David Bromige

Melissa Wolsak is the author of The Garcia Family Co-Mercy (Tsunami Editions
1994); her writing appears in Barscheit, Front, Writing, Boo, Raddle Moon,
Matrix and the electronic journals Alterran Poetry Assemblage and East
Village Poetry Web.

well now, if we are to make anything of this at all don't we need to know
first of all if the person who attempted to post this notice had sub'd to

Dear Ed:

Since I haven't seen a Talisman lately, it occurs to ask: Did an issue with the Bronk conference
proceedings ever appear? If so, which one and when?

Announcing the publication of two new books from subpress collective:

DIMINUTIVE REVOLUTIONS
by Daniel Bouchard
80 pages; perfect bound
ISBN: 0-9666303-9-4
$10

"Daniel Bouchard's book is wonderful. A pure and absolute democracy of
insight. Even had I not the privilege of knowing the author, I'd still feel
moved to praise "Diminutive Revolutions." These poems make me feel
that all attempts to convince us we live in an age bereft of beauty,
poor in meaning, and lacking compassion will fail. Boredom is a crime,
the active mind is alive."
     - Jennifer Moxley, author of "Imagination Verses"


BLISS TO FILL
by Prageeta Sharma
64 pages; perfect bound
ISBN: 0-930068-00-X
$10

"The use of poetry in this day and age is for its lesson of relation.
Bliss to Fill is full of love poems, full of I and you and all their
difficulties in getting along.  And here, in the midst of love's
intimacies,
the poem is large and necessary, negotiating places and cultures,
negotiating what it means to be relating across boundaries.  This is
a stunning collection."
     - Juliana Spahr

Both books available through Small Press Distribution, 1-800-869-7553
and through

Just wanted to mention that Maria Damon's brief post kind of sums up a lot
of what I meant in mine -- for her "diaries" I have "modest and/or
shameful poets" like Hopkins who didn't publish, and for her "alpha male"
I have (pardon me) Barrett Watten.

I think Jacques makes some interesting points, though, in one of his
follow-up emails, which is that he is using Bourdieu's frame of discourse
not absolute as a mode of looking at "our" work, but that it helps bring
in focus many neglected aspects of this sort of discussion, hence it is
merely a tool that can be put away at any time.  The problem with a
too-trusted frame of discourse is that it invariably affects the data, the
literature or the biographies, that one is attempting to analyze;
consequently, we spend a lot of time trying to tell people what they are
_really_ thinking and _really_ doing without spending the time to enter
into this activity with a sense of detail, "luminous" detail, if you will.
An example: when people were asking whether WCW as an "anti-semite," an
answer just couldn't offer itself because the frame of the discourse
didn't permit a suitable answer, it was either/or, and it seemed
ridiculous to put WCW on one side with the Nazis and Ezra Pound, but not
quite right to put him on the other.  The frame of the discourse should be
malleable based on the topic or materials being examined; also, we should
be satisfied with no answer.  [Sidenote: there's an interesting story in
Tuesday's New York Times about creating "mirage" doubles of atomic
particles on which one can run analyses without perverting the being of
the original atom, as any little thing you send an atom's way changes it
so much that nothing you observe can be thought of as "true".]

One of my problems with this thread is that there's not a lot of new data
being presented, just revisions of the model of analysis, hence the frame
grows more complex but the range of references becomes very isolated, and
generalizations are tossed around, such as about the role of Donald
Allen's anthology in the plays of cultural capital.  My sense is that the
role the anthology played in New York culture among those who were
actively involved, i.e. "included", in it, was probably much smaller than
what is made of it by us, the successors who view it as some sort of
milestone.  It probably wasn't a milestone to Frank O'Hara, he knew all
that work (and probably thought a lot of it was terrible) -- just a drop
in the bucket, something to chat about between movies.  That it was the
shot heard around the world may not have meant much to him (just as we can
probably agree that Rimbaud didn't care much for what the Season in Hell
was doing to Paris when he was in his thirties).

As for the "why write" question, one thing I might suggest is that one
writes to render one's immediate environment either more predictable or
more interesting, perhaps even more "stimulating" in a sexual way
(somewhat different that the idea of the poem as unalienated labor, which
is worth mentioning since my own computer-poems are very alienated labor,
but I think they're "stimulating" to me to have in the environment).  This
basic idea encapsulates, I think, the idea of writing as the creation of
"cultural capital" since one is writing to propel oneself further on some
path toward, on the one hand, self-identity ("predictability" from
day-to-day) which one perhaps mistakenly believes comes throught public
recognition, and the chance to enter new spheres of being (getting a
little reknown, going to better parties), on other words in changing one's
lifestyle (because one thinks that having money and being famous is more
interesting than not).  But it also takes in those writers who don't
operate in any of these ways, such as those who keep poems in diaries and
those who, in a different light, write some version of pornography for
themselves just to keep them going (such as R. Crumb, or his brother who,
in the documentary about Crumb, wrote line after line of tiny type which
was not legible to anyone), or those whose writing, like Edward Thomas's,
were merely spiritual excercises in preparation for sermons.  But that's
just an idea.

tom bell noted that in a book of psych essays "all of the women began their
piece by explaining their background, experience, credentials, and/or
education.  This was not true of the men." then asked "Is this a singular
phenomenon in psychology or is it also true of literature?"

some psychologist has likely tried to study the question ---- i'll ask my
psychologist when i go home tonight --- but to add more inconclusive
anecdotal data : when we had a reading here in town for the group here all
of the women reading (3 of the 4 in the group) made some sort of
introduction, either to their work or giving some account of their
interactions or introduction to the group ---- one of the 6 guys reading
made such introductions

i remember being sort of surprised when they started happening and wondered
why it hadnt even occurred to me to offer any intro or context or whatever

Hello all,

My first posting to this interesting list. Just sending a poem I'd =
appreciate any and all suggestions on. Probably better if you e-mail me =
privately, doubt that the rest of the list would be interested.
Cheers

Thoughts encased in words
are jettisoned at high velocity:
    the chill brushing against my ear.
The rattle before the shake
of cuneiform worms eating
    through sleepwalking sewers.
oh, glass made of air
maybe it will snow tonight?
Decaying beneath my feet,
soil of dissected images:
    lamp, plate, grass, love, writing--
hurl wishes at a falling star.
Slipped beneath fireworks
straight lines shaping the sky
into spheres of coloured lights:
    reflected, and refracted, wanting
thoughts to fall into
my soft, lined palms.
Eyes follow, follow the scene, I return
    eating a bowl of Pistachio nuts.
My thoughts are in
the Royal Albert Hall:
    wait for the clash of symbols,
    wait for the curtain to fall.
My thumbs are raw, savaged,
hurting from cleaving apart,
    opening up these hard little nuts.
Always two sets of reality
before my brown eyes;
    one is true, the other must be false.
But my thumbs are bleeding
and my lips cannot form
    a single word : band aid.

I find Kent Johnson expressions of paranoia not only tiresome but in
extremely poor taste.  "Los desaparicidos" is the term used for folks
murdered by right-wing death squads and buried in ditches.  Seeing
those words appropriated to describe the alleged virtual hounding of
the likes of Henry Gould makes my stomach turn and my lip curl the
same way it did when Clarence Thomas claimed he was the victim of a
"lynching."  It's a rhetorical device of the lowest sort, and not in
the slightest bit amusing (to me) even if intended as irony.  Which
brings me to Gerald Schwartz' question about the perception of humor.
Comedy is all a matter of perspective. Tadeusz Borowski wrote stories
about the Holocaust that made me both laugh and cry; I resonate to
them and find them funny in the most painful way.  On the other hand,
the old riddle about the difference between a Jew and a pizza hits me
at about the same level as Johnson's use of "los desaparacidos".  As
we were all instructed back in kindergarten:  it's the difference
between laughing *with* and laughing *at*.  Not really that hard a
concept to grasp. Seems like just about any joke can be understood in
terms of the "we" and the "them" it creates.

The following quote from Kristeva ('Subject in process," _Tel Quel
Reader_ seems to me to mean that the subjective thrust should come from
inside the objective (in our culture) rather than from a diametrically
opposite stance and that this is not necessarily a simple
feminine/masculine dichotomy:

"The signifying function refused by our culture by consigning it to the
domain of art, that is, to libraries or conferences  ..the experience
that the subject of theory might have herself of this
functioning...invasion of the positivist neutrality of theory by the
subjective experience of the theorist, by her capacity to put herself
'on trial', to move out of the enclosure of her individuality, be it
split,to then return to the fragile site of metalanguage so as to utter
the logic of this process, suffered if not understood."
     But then I have misunderstood (rather
'did not understand") Kristeva before.

This just in from Charles Amirkhanian of the Other Minds list....

****************************************************************

The Associated Press recently asked the presidential candidates the
following question related to the arts:

Do you support federal subsidies for the arts?

(in alphabetical order, the responses are:)

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES:
Bill Bradley: ``Yes. The arts have enriched the lives of Americans, as
well as our economy. The National Endowment for the Arts has been an
important catalyst for that effort.''

Al Gore: ``I strongly believe in encouraging and supporting the arts and
would continue the current policy of support. The arts are an important
part of our life and our history and should be supported.''


REFORM CANDIDATE:
Pat Buchanan: ``No. The National Endowment for the Arts has subsidized
projects that are blasphemous, degraded and obscene. Let the
Mapplethorpes and Serranos insult God and man on their own dime.''


REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES:
George W. Bush: ``I believe we should continue federal funding for the
arts, but give states a greater say in how the funds are spent. I don't
believe we should spend public money to support obscene material or
denigrate religion.''

Alan Keyes: ``No.''

John McCain: ``No. I have opposed federal funding for the National
Endowment for the Arts because I believe it is not proper to use tax
dollars for what many Americans feel are the obscene and inappropriate
projects this organization has supported. I support providing federal
block grants to the states for arts education and artistic endeavors
pursued by state and local authorities, while assuring that federal tax
dollars are not spent on obscene or offensive material.''

-----------------
Thanks to Americans for the Arts for this information.  Remember to vote
on Primary Day!

Announcing the publication of two new books from subpress collective:

DIMINUTIVE REVOLUTIONS
by Daniel Bouchard
80 pages; perfect bound
ISBN: 0-9666303-9-4
$10

"Daniel Bouchard's book is wonderful. A pure and absolute democracy of
insight. Even had I not the privilege of knowing the author, I'd still feel
moved
to praise "Diminutive Revolutions." These poems make me feel that all
attempts to convince us we live in an age bereft of beauty, poor in
meaning, and lacking compassion will fail. Boredom is a crime, the active
mind is alive."

--Jennifer Moxley, author of "Imagination Verses"


BLISS TO FILL
by Prageeta Sharma
64 pages; perfect bound
ISBN: 0-930068-00-X
$10

"The use of poetry in this day and age is for its lesson of relation.  Bliss
to Fill is full of love poems, full of I and you and all their difficulties
in getting along.  And here, in the midst of love's intimacies, the poem is
large and necessary, negotiating places and cultures, negotiating what it
means to be relating across boundaries.  This is a stunning collection."

--Juliana Spahr

Both books available through Small Press Distribution, 1-800-869-7553 and
through

`A`A Arts
2955 Dole St.
Honolulu, HI 96816

Also from subpress:

Catalina Cariaga.  Cultural Evidence.
Edwin Torres.  Fractured Humorous.
John Wilkinson.  Oort's Cloud: Poems 1970-1984.

do the best we can in our moment.

at times to quote Bukowski
at least the legend of his name
to those on this list who seek
cultural capital and prestige
as explanations for motivations
for the literary writing he sought................at all

Or as Dorn put it somewhere:

"There have been many accusations of "censorship" on this  list --
specifically against the list moderators -- all of which I have found
disingenuous. From having observed the "Henry Gould events" on this list I
do not believe that Charles Bernstein or Joel Kuszai "censored" anyone, so
I'm with Dodie on this one. If CB or JK contacted listees about the number
of their posts, that does not constitute "censorship," and it was within
their rights as list owners and moderators, and further, was for the benefit
of the entire list community. I think people should be more careful about
what kind of accusations they make, and be sure that there is ample evidence
to support said accusation.
Thanks,
Kathy Lou"


I thought preventing someone from saying things one doesn't like, often for
the sake of the "larger community," is the very definition of censorship. It
doesn't matter if the prevention is official or "back channel."

Re: Maria’s response taking Kent’s referral to Dodie’s "confusion" to
task--Dodie introduces her conclusions regarding the Gould matter with "Has
my memory failed me or..." and "as far as I remember (and I wasn’t really
paying attention)...". So, it seems reasonable to me that Kent attributed a
certain amount of confusion to a statement prefaced with its own
self-acknowledged unreliability.

Despite the reorganization, I do not find the managed List to be a place
where a diversity of voices is more present--if anything, it seems, the
opposite has occurred--a cautious repression pervades. Spontaneity and wit
are noticeably scarce. And there isn’t any evidence that women are
contributing at a greater pace (and the paucity of women’s voices here is
discouraging).

is a wonderfulcase in point vis a vis the gender issues raised here by
elizabeth, dodie, etc.  it is a classic of what's called "condescension," or
"belittlement," or "marginalization" of a female voice. would you have used
the term "confusion" and exhorted, say, jacques d or charles b etc to read
more carefully had they disagreed with your account or interpretation of an
event?  when a woman disagrees with you, it is not because she weak-minded.
it is because she has surveyed the same evidence and come to a different
conclusion.

Has my memory failed me or is it not the case that Henry Gould

zillions of people begged both on the list and backchannel to the
administration for Henry to not post so many messages each day, but
to combine his messages, he left the list.  There was no censorship
of content here.  It was a mass appeal by hundreds of people who felt
bombarded and harassed by HG's excessive number of posts.

I was never involved in any of the Henry stuff and I have no bad
feelings against him, but this developing issue of his martyrdom is
smoke without fire.

What Susan Howe thinks of the list is Susan's business and shouldn't
be taken as any reflection of the list.

I think Charles, Joel Kuszai, and now Chris have done a wonderful,
apparently thankless job here.  And all three of them has been
supportive of my own experiments into gender hysteria.

Kathy Lou, is censorship too strong a word? is that it? i was not blaming
anyone; just noting things about the forum. i really hope i've been clear on
this. i'm pleased that it's being talked about in various ways.

framular fantasia: only weird white men stuck in offices with fat stomachs
and feet up appear in Benetton ads.* Sappho made a name for herself in the
mode of TS Eliot. Dickinson in the mode of Pound. Djuna Barnes in mode of
Mae West. Sarah Fielding wrote the most talked about novels in your adv
level junior year of high school English class. Aphra Behn usurped the
position of Shakespeare, and no one even realizes it. Mary Daly has taken on
the cultural clout of that Bloom fellow, or even William Gass. The
Hystericists are more well known than the Surrealists. Your subjectivity
fits only into my stream of consciousness obj. But i love ya for it and
forgive myself.

*This is happening in the "dumb men" ads fellows I know complain of.

Subject:      Sense of time
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The shape of time thread is fascinating to me. Don't we prejudge the
question if we call it a shape? It could be a feel, a taste, a sound,
etc...

I've long a problematic relationship to time, and felt that I've
misperceived it. For example, my sense is that January to May is an
equivalent duration to September through December. If I look at a calendar
I see that I am mistaken. My sense of time is mostly cyclical, sometimes
spiral.  I am pathologically punctual, though prone to miss long-term
deadlines.

Poetry makes time elastic--compresses or expands it; at least that is my
experience reading it. The whole idea of time standing still for the
traditional lyric moment still rings true with me. Reading the same text
at an interval of twenty-five years is a strange experience, especially if
no reading has intervened in the interim.

I started playing drums about a year ago. I didn't realize when I began
that my real reason was to further explore my obsession with time--as
though poetry were not enough! The vocabulary for speaking about time that
drummers have developed is really incredible, and I tend to apply it back
to poetry metaphorically and literally, as in my poem "Sam Beckett's Ride
Cymbal."

Just a few random thoughts. I could go on for months on this topic...

Hello POETizens,

I am putting together a bibliography on the idea of THE POET and was
wondering if people could point me to essays and passages and quotes by
POETS and nonPOETS alike that attempt to identify what is called THE
POET, or to define the role of THE POET or THE POET's relationship to
society or a la Plato to denigrate that role or identification, etc.

I mean specifically THE POET and not POETry or POETics.

Any backchannelled assistance would be much apurshiated.

Kindly,

Mike

My response was intended to deal with the problem of vanity.
Taken out of context
to suit your own rhetorical purpose(s)
what I intended can be made to mean any number of horrible things.

"Breath" and "Step" as terms don't exclude anyone from whatever inspiration
whatever pen may conduit through whatever dark city
any one of us may find ourselves in folly wandering.

I don't like the human condition anymore than the next pilgrim.

Creeley's program to make or try to make something terrific out of it
or even a Bronk's shout

gives me at least a clue to continue to the next try..........somehow.

Very interesting question from this arizona point of view, where it seems
regional is dominated by popular stereotypes of the region, and not at all
by actual work that goes on in the region, which would include the
experimental (in many forms) as well as a lot of other things not covered
by the stereotypes.

Please keep me informed.

Susan, this is a fine poem. Thanks for posting it. The framing (the first)
stanza is economical & necessary. I do hear an echo of Marianne Moore in
its last 2 lines which is intrusive and cd be cleared away by substituting
another word for 'amused.' The strongest line to me is "still and content,"
as surprising definition of such condition. "Grasshopper"--wouldnt it be
better as a plural? Since we are told of "the one...and the other"?  David

On regionalism and experimentation--see the current issue of The New

explores the intersections of regionalism and experimental writing.

If someone intimidates others into silence (thereby effectively censoring
them) is it censorship to block the intimidating language?

Just a theoretical question, of course.

Small Press Traffic Reading
Friday, February 25, 7:30 p.m.
Catalina Cariaga
Heather Fuller


Catalina Cariaga lives in Oakland, and her first book Cultural Evidence is
the first production of Subpress Collective, the new artist-run poetry
collective.  Cultural Evidence is an intensely serious exploration of
family and language, combining the uncanny authenticities of oral tradition
and the most sophisticated mixed-use typeface technology, mirroring the
diaspora of her family from the South Asian Pacific islands to California's
rocky beaches and cities. Publishers Weekly says "Whether deconstructing
myths of anthropology's objectivity, of "culture" as defined by different,
often incompatible worldviews, or self-sustaining myths of non-fluid time,
nation, place or language, Cariaga's passionate investigations provide
ample evidence for their dispersal."  Her poems have appeared in Chain, New
American Writing and Zyzzyva, among others.

In the poetry circles of Washington, DC, Heather Fuller is a weird goddess
of chance and rapid-fire experiment.  We in San Francisco deserve to have
her live here, but she doesn't.  Like Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove, she
conducts arcane tests into the patterns of the tattered cobwebs that hold
us together and drip from the rafters of the ancient cathedrals.  Her books
include perhaps this is a rescue fantasy (1997), beggar (1998), Eyeshot
(1999) and two forthcoming books-Madonna Fatigue (Meow Press), and C Ration
Dog & Pony (Like Books).  Her essays, reviews, plays, and poetry have
appeared in Chain, the minnesota review, Mirage #4/Period[ical], Antenym,
Primary Writing, two girls review, Combo, Membrane, Articulate, Poetry New
York, readme, and elsewhere.

Concerning what Thomas Bell suggests re Krisyeva, I earlier send him the
following back-channel (typos corrected here). I offer it to all in hopes of
continuing the thread.
............

Tom, thanks for the post. I almost added "Kristevan" rather than "DeLeuzian"

to my message. She is surely one of the richest sites for mining
subjectivity, but I don't feel that here she does more than speak to the
value of relexivity in theory. ... and I guess I am arguing that reflexivity

is precisely another name for "objectifying subjectivity." When she writes
of hunger and desire .... then she is very conscious breaking through
the loop of objectifying discourse. I do not consider object/subject as
polar, but as imbricated. perhaps with other factors in a fold.

I have for some time imagined that the absence of the identity of males is
somehow related to illusions of omnipresence, theories of no-self,
monotheism, products of hypersurvivalist and isolationist quasi-fascist
island pirate nation-states and monarchies such as Japan, Britain and the us
(perhaps the us is just a really big island).  I've had the overwhelming
impression that the aesthetic of no-self, and the absence of identities
supported by many (mostly male) writers, is incredibly masculine,
patriarchal.  it's the type of aesthetic that perhaps gives the rationale
for erasing identities in prisons, for building panopticons, for numbering
soldiers labeled with dog tags who are sent off as identity-less numbers to
die in battle, for dehumanizing the organizing strengths of humans resistant
to such patriarchal forms of power.  this perception for me applies from
literature to religion to philosophy to politics.  I can just barely see,
perhaps on an intuitive level, a tacit prescription that men should not be
present, we should be hovering over the landscape, as gods, as objective
observers.  you know, the strong silent types.  while femininity seems more
firmly rooted in being of this world, that there is some belief that bias
and personality and presence _add_, not detract.

of course this could be one horrific generalization.  just please note I
have said this is merely my sense of the world, of masculinity and
femininity.

I noticed something interesting today.  I was reading a book of essays
on psychology.  There was a pretty even split of male and female
authors, but all of the women began their piece by explaining their
background, experience, credentials, and/or education.  This was not
true of the men.  Is this a singular phenomenon in psychology or is it
also true of literature?  If generally true I'm not sure what to make of
it.

I dont know your take on "recent," but I published (a number of times) an
essay called "Reaney's Region," in which I theorized an opposition between
the concept of region and what Olson called "polis." The essay appeared,
for example, in my 1982 book, _A Way With Words_, Ottawa, Oberon Books.

Here's an old post of mine which never made it to the list during it's
recent problems.  The Jim is Jim Andrews (not Jim Kirk).  I had posted it to
the Rhizome list as well, where it caused a little stir (but not enough --
soon they were just bludgeoning each other again).

***

Hi Jim,

I went to a Rhizome event a few days back, at which an artist gave a talk on
his work over the past 4 years, which was pretty interesting -- the work
spanned uses of Java applets and Flash, not to mention really fine uses of
sound collage and very basic (quick-loading) imagery to great effect.  But I
was struck by the frame of the event, as it was sponsored by the magazine
Silicon Alley as well as by Artbyte, which seems to have only practically no
consciousness of the potential dangers of the role corporate (meaning
capitalist) entities play in this dialogue of corporate (meaning web-based
community) art creations.  The artist himself calmly noted frequently that
he had "two careers," one as a web-designer for a company and one as an
artist.  This, I think, is different than being a poet and a some-time
writer of book reviews, teacher, or editor; it seemed that he was mining his
own artistic ideas for later use on a corporate website, kind of like when
MTV mined the ideas of avant-garde filmmakers for their videos, except in
this case the artist (whose work by the way is at www.lightofspeed.com) was
both figures, artist and exploiter.  In Artbyte itself, there was an article
called "Prophets and Profits" about figures such as philosopher Stewart
Brand who, in their theories of the "long view," are really selling their
ideas as vehicles for solutions in business concerns (a relationship
MacLuhan could be said to have foreseen with his work with advertisers).  I
guess the reason why this isn't totally scandalous is that the underlying
assumption is that businesses have to survive these days based the on the
degree of "innovation" in their products, and since business moves so
rapidly these days -- a major site, for instance, can be set up in 3 months
and go public probably soon after (I don't know much about these things,
actually), they move nearly as rapidly as artists used to move (inventing
cubism over the course of a summer, for example), a contrast to how long it
took to build the railroads.  Obviously I'm not the first to notice this
paradox or problem, but I was surprised at this event at how it was merely
overlooked -- perhaps we have adapted so much beyond the old
individual/institution (romantic) paradigm that there really isn't any
adequate to describe the present situation with these terms, and no one
cares to find new ones.

I didn't know that Strasser set up the weak blood site, and I don't think of
the site as a "failure" not seeming to fulfill certain promises that were
suggested in the format -- it fulfilled other promises very well.  So I
guess it's "noble" in that way.  Are their other similar projects where one
could find a quick introduction to international web-poetry?

I haven't caught much on the "antiorp" thread -- what's that?

> I'm somewhat familiar with that work. Talanbooks published a handsome
selection of that work about ten years ago, edited by McCaffery I think,
after Nichol's death called Rational Geomancy. I wouldn't think it would be
Rhizome territory, though I might be wrong.

Yes, it's through this book that I know the work.  I'm amused by your phrase
"I wouldn't think it would be Rhizome territory" since implicit in the idea
of the "rhizome" is that pretty much everything is in the same territory,
you just have to find out how.  You're probably right, though, I wouldn't
guess that there are many on that list familiar with the work, but a
familiarity with it might help shatter this print (passe)/web (present)
assumption that underlies, again, much of the attitudes that I hear at
places like the Rhizome event or other web events I've been too.  I think
the TRG work, or McCaffery's work in particular, is more successful than you
suggest when writing that it seemed more the "application of theory" than
work -- check out Evoba, one of my favorite short works, or Panopticon or
the poems in Theory of Sediment.  His early "concrete" epic is presently at
the Coach House Books site (www.chbooks.com) -- it's called Carnival.

> The machine, small and large, is corporate or governmental in its
construction. We can then be pirates and anti
corporate netizens should we please. But we are faced nonetheless with our
place in a collective undertaking that involves the corporate and the non
human at many levels. This should not be unexamined. And how can one be
other than ambivalent about it, regardless of the choice you make?

Yes, this relates to what I wrote above.  How effective a pirate is one,
however, having been feted with high paychecks your entire life (the
"bohemian" artists I survive among here in Williamsburg, for example, make
their money in large doses at a time, once a month or so often, on large
projects sponsored by businesses, and hence live better than me who work a
9-5 slug job -- could they give that up?  Would they ever have too?  This
isn't to totalize the situation -- their are many different types here, and
I'm being really reductive -- but I wonder if this influx of money, which is
part of the art world in general, effects one's selective blindness to these
issues.  And I also wonder why they seem to be blind to the idea that poets
are not antiquated figures who are "missing the point" of technology -- I
wonder if the problem is that poetry has long since lost its connection to
public utility, or when it does connect it is very selectively so, as a sort
of calming agent for bourgeois lifestyles.

> Ted Warnell's work (http://www.warnell.com). He uses Windows 3.11 and no
plugins and an intelligent modicum of javascript. He's very fond of
Photoshop though--and uses it with great skill and effect. But primarily his
work is in the HTML itself, not the bitmaps, which is very unusual (to do it
well). I mean his visual works are made primarily of HTML. That is his
primary material. He posted a note today thanking another poet for posting a
work he could surf without having to upgrade his system or installing any
plugins. A quiet note of protest or possibly exasperation. His material is
largely HTML. He doesn't need plugins. Or he has chosen his material to
avoid plugins? Or what? Is his art somehow more pure or unsullied by the
corporate by virtue of this? Although the question may have something to it,
at this point I look to the art itself, not so much what it was made with,
though some work on the Web is incompetent enough that it shouts Flash or
Photoshop or whatever.

I don't have anything at all against plug-ins. The time will come when
plug-ins will just install silently behind the browser as the page comes
up -- it often does, already.  People can program their own plug-ins too --
they just seem a distraction now because of download time.  But I'm very
interested in Warnell limiting himself to a few basic tools to create his
art, it means he carries out a more intensive investigation based on a few
premises.  One of my favorite pieces of web art uses just HTML in
fixed-length font, this being Juliet Martin's piece at www.ubu.com.  Wait,
here's the URL:

http://www.ubu.com/contemp/martin/martin.html

This still strikes me as a superb piece, and I know she's working slowly on
other things.  It's one of the first things that struck me as not being
threatened with being "dated" over time -- hence the virtues of avoiding the
"latest technology."  It's also utterly useless for business, there isn't a
single image in the piece, and the cleanness of the concept along with the
overriding metaphor, whatever that is in fact (it's called "oooxxxooo"),
that quietly hums in the background, is very satisfying to think about.
It's something of a "hypertext" fiction, though much better than any of
those fictions that I've read online that involve prose.  Anyway, again, she
limits herself to a set of tools and carries through on the promises.  I
haven't looked enough at the Warnell stuff, but I remember liking much of
it, just conerned that the pieces were a little too self-contained, too
static, not using the aspect of the web-page having several layers beneath
its surface, of the possibility of true change within it, the layers of
links and associations that, like lava below the surface, forcibly recreates
the work each time you see it.  I have similar misgivings with Strasser's
pieces, incredibly effective as they are.  I think Warnell's pieces, though,
are pretty successful, as they follow through on the promise of gallery-type
art getting off the walls and into the homes, and escaping the fetishism of
the unique art object, and of exploring how digital imagery -- the types of
disruption peculiar to pixelated photographs -- affects the way one sees.

> I never connected strongly with concrete poetry. Part of the 'platform',
after all, was to create parallelism between the look and the meaning,
simple mindedly mimetic, often, was it not?

Yes, I agree.  I think, still, though, that the Brazilians have/had a lot to
offer but we don't understand the frame of these creations enough -- as an
attempt at an international art, a dialogue that transcends language which
is particularly useful for a young country (or young literature), as a
series of values conveyed thorugh typeface (certain faces suggesting utopian
attitudes, certain nostalgic romantic) which had particular meanings in
Brazilian culture at the time, etc.  Haroldo De Campos has extended all of
these issues in ways that have to be "translated" like any poetry.  In any
case, I wish there was a good study of Brazilian concrete in particular
apart from the "international" movement which seems, in general, simplistic.
The problem is the cost of getting these books out.

> Doubt: you extend your arm to draw and see a metal claw.

Yes.  I see it often, and now it ends in a "mouse."

Anyway, gotta run.  Thanks for the links -- I've seen most of those already,
and liked the one, especially, that slides down the page.  The sound piece
is interesting, too, hope you do more.  You should check out the Macromedia
site, there's a pretty good sound piece out there that uses the metaphor of
a surgeon using a pick on a person's spinal column to produce sounds from, I
suppose, the _inside_.  It's for some site that makes music sequencers.  If
I find the URL I'll send it on.

I have one work in Director which I'd like to finish this weekend.  I'd tell
you about it but it's already 10am and I want to enjoy my freezing cold
apartment on this Saturday.  Going to see Mark Wallace and Buck Downs read
today at Double Happiness, and then to the "Shark" party.

Anyway, cheers,
Brian

Dear Poetics List-Owners,

Below you will find a call for papers for a conference on writing (with a
special emphasis on poetics and poetry) to be held at the University of
Iowa.  I believe that this conference would be of special interest to the
members of your list.  Would it be possible for you to post this?

If you have and questions or concerns, please let me know.  I look forward
to your reply.

--David Banash

Call for Papers

CRAFT, CRITIQUE, CULTURE:
An Interdisciplinary Conference on Writing in the Academy
September 29-October 1, 2000
University of Iowa
Iowa City, Iowa

Keynote speakers will include:

Bob Perelman, professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania and
author of more than ten books of poetry, including _Ten to One_, _The
Future of Memory_, and _Virtual Reality_, as well as two books of
criticism, _The Marginalization of Poetry:  Language Writing and Literary
History_ and _The Trouble with Genius:  Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and
Zukofsky_.

Mark Levine, professor of Creative Writing at the Iowa Writers Workshop.
Prof. Levine is the author of two books of poetry, _Enola Gay_ and _Debt_,
and also writes feature journalism for _The New Yorker_ and other
magazines.

CRAFT, CRITIQUE, CULTURE is an interdisciplinary conference which aims to
explore the divisions between craft and critique in academic institutions.
Where and when are these divisions justified and useful, and when are they
specious and harmful?  How and where can they be broken down, and where
should they be preserved?  How do they function to construct both powerful
positions and limited horizons?  How should we understand and negotiate
this divide, and how do we communicate across it?  And finally, what is
the role of craft and critique in relation to culture?  What is the future
of aesthetic analysis and production in the field of cultural
studies?  The goal of this conference is to provide a space to discuss and
debate these questions.

This conference invites scholars from a range of disciplines, including
poets, writers, literary critics, teachers, non-fiction essayists,
theorists, culturalists, art historians, as well as visual and performing
artists.  We welcome completed papers (15 page maximum), abstracts (200
words or less), or panel proposals which explore the complex and agonistic
relationships between craft and critique.  We also encourage brief
proposals for performative and interactive panels that exceed or evade the
familiar academic structures--including, but not limited to, dramatic or
visual presentations, readings of original works of prose or poetry,
interactive investigations, and short analyses related to the topics of
the conference.  In addition to these presentations, we will host a series
of round-table discussions between professors, artists, and graduate
students to investigate the way artists and critics communicate,
collaborate, and coexist within the university; as well as the way artists
read critics, the way critics read artists, and the ways in which we might
more productively read one another.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

*  The role of aesthetic analysis in contemporary criticism and cultural
    studies
*  Examining the craft, style, and performative aspects of critical theory
*  Historicizing the poet-critic divide
*  Critics representations of writers / writers characterizations of
    critics
*  Parallel discourses in English departments and creative writing
    workshops
*  Academic publishing:  bridging academic and popular audiences
*  The writer as genius versus the writer as assemblage
*  Writing and identity
*  The pleasure of reading (in the academy?)
*  Pedagogical issues:  the role of aesthetic appreciation in the
    classroom

Selected papers will be published in the _Iowa Review_.

Please submit papers, abstracts, or proposals by JUNE 15, 2000 to:

David Banash and Anthony Enns
Department of English
308 English-Philosophy Bldg.
University of Iowa
Iowa City, IA 52242-1492
david-banash@uiowa.edu
anthony-enns@uiowa.edu

Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.

I had written this to Kent as a "backchannel" and he asked me to post it to
the list.  I haven't rewritten it, so please skip the tedious parts.  He had
cc'd me on the post.

***


Hi Kent,

Thanks for sending me the URL, it saves me the trouble of trying to get a
copy of Skanky Possum, though I may anyway for the other stuff.

I rarely "backchannel" unless it's to perhaps apologize to someone for
having written hastily and heatedly, or to address some issue (like with
Henry) which someone raised with me.  If I am upset about something on the
list, I try to convert my feelings into some sort of "productive" post
rather than rag on someone behind the scenes to calm my aching soul -- which
is to say, I don't particularly care about my own ideas or how they have
been changed, interpreted, perverted, admired, etc, in a vacuum.  The only
reason I write to the list is to be share ideas, not to circumbscribe, for
myself, my own ideas, which I can do alone.  My hope is that my ideas will
be attacked and turned-over, since I feel that I could be as bad a dictator
as anyone.

Anyway, I'm writing to you "backchannel" simply because I haven't, in my
brief time reading on this issue (and mostly your writing on it, though
others as well) seen any development in thinking about this, and so in
general don't think it's valuable for the list.  I think I have (eh hem)
things to write on the topic, but I'm pretty well aware that they are boring
to other people, and I hate to bore people.

My problems with your reasoning, though, in your posts to Chris (who, I
think, says about everything I would want to say, and even boldly with his
full frontal statement that the list is "ideological") are basically the
following:

1. Your use of the word "censorship" is misguided.  "Censorship," for it to
carry the moral weight that you intend it to, for it to be tied to some sort
of contract of the "rights of man" that is at the heart of our Consitution
(certainly the subtext of your rhetorical use of the word), and for it to
resonate with the use of this term historically in regards to revolutionary
activity, requires some sense of the totality of the control by authorities,
which is to say these authorities would have to be "managing" _all_ of
dissemination of media in a particular, isolated location.  An illustration:
we generally champion Dostoyevsky for having written under "conditions of
censorship" (i.e. everything that was published in Russia itself went to a
censorship board) and to have utilized an array of rhetorical and narrative
strategies to get some pretty unseemly and difficult ideas into the public
(or at least literary) realm.  However, such an activity, the work of
utilizing these strategies, and hence to be a more subtle writer, seems not
to have entered into the equation of those writers who seem to feel
"censored" from the list -- quite the opposite, these writers become more
self-contradictory and high-minded about their position, shuffle around
abstract terms like "censorship", shout bloody murder, engage in really poor
puns, enact every other sort of ploy to manipulate the "spectacle," etc. but
little more.  I think this is so because this is not a case of "censorship"
as I recognize it; it is a case of "editing," and as editing cuts awfully
close to being completely "open," for which it can be commended.  If this
were true censorship, like the kind of censorship that puts people in prison
(like my friend, a Korean novelist who has spent the last 4 years in prison
for a series of historical novels [historical because he knew they would be
_censored_ if he placed them in the present time] he wrote years ago and for
a visit to North Korea) and exiles (like my uncle, who hasn't been able to
return to South Korea for his student activities), and if the writers were
indeed representing or attempting to express a range of ideas that were of
genuine use to a wide range of people for whom the writer felt sincere
responsibility, then the writer would restrategize his/her methods, take
stock of the situation, and act accordingly.  To do anything less would only
trivialize the value of one's discourse, not to mention to project the very
lack of this sense of responsibility to others.

In any case, I think you, whom I understand have a great interest in world
affairs, do a disservice to those who don't have the luxury to cry
"censorship" because they are not permitted to post on this, or any, list.
You use of the word "censorship" in regards to this only exxagerates my
sense of the banality of this issue.

2. You are careful to state that there is some sort of correspondence to
what, in this case, Henry writes to the list, and the "ideological" line of
the list, and yet you have never (nor has anyone else, far as I know) ever
offered an observation of how Henry's views contradict the views you feel
are stated on this list.  With this bird's eye perspective -- the present
looking on the past -- and with the archives there to be read and studied, I
have never seen a description of how these forces were arrayed, what
positions were adopted, how they grew, were constructed and destroyed, where
they brought people.  If Henry is so "passionate" a poet and thinker, then
why, in rehashes of what happened last year (or whenever) have I never seen
anything like a position adopted by Henry (or any of the poets mentioned)
that was, itself, enough to get him "banned."  The object of the controversy
is always centered on this issue of "banishment" itself, never on the ideas.
This leads me to suspect that there were no ideas, only gestures -- "flames"
is what we call them in e-land -- the culminating one being leaving the list
(or being banned from it, or whatever).  And if there were ideas, I trust
that I would have discovered them by now because these "banned" poets would
have utilized their brains to find other avenues through which to propagate
them, of which there are many.  I try to read everything I get in the mail,
and get quite a lot.

As we are all amateur anthropologists -- it's probably one of the defining
traits of this particular generation of poets, a trait that we adopt,
ironically, from the Language poets introduction of anthropological (usually
read as post-Marxist or materialist, but more generally anthropological)
methods in the reading of literary culture (an introduction which, I
believe, was poorly executed, replete with blindnesses and biases which, I
think, are causing some of the growing pains we are witnessing today, but
which was totally necessary), we should perhaps take the next step and
really consider in more detail how literary culture operates, considering
our own biases (your use of proper names being one of them) disrupt whatever
analytical framework (provisional as it may be) we are attempting to
construct.  If we don't care to construct a framework, that's fine, but then
you are impotent to appeal to issues of "rights" and "censorship," which are
words that have engaged the minds of people for centuries.

I, myself, don't particularly care how literary culture operates, to be
quite frank, or at least haven't found this subject to be more interesting
than, say, artificial intelligence or Matthew Barney.  Maybe it's because I
live in New York and have the luxury of attending several readings a week,
sometimes 2 or 3 a night if I wish (never), and even of holding a
well-attended reading in my apartment, that I don't feel quite as handcuffed
as you or others do about what happens on this list.  Most of the poets that
I correspond with on a regular basis are not on this list, and I feel
conversations in bars and apartments are often more constructive, anyway,
and more nuanced -- nobody can take advantage of you in these situations,
you live on your wits, which is more exciting.  (To go back to our regular
bogeyman, WCW never had a list, only some rather soggy poet friends, and
Pound in Europe, and if anything this isolation seems to have helped him.)
Nonetheless, I think the list is a valuable compliment to these activities,
since it offers an opportunity to work through several ideas in a somewhat
organized fashion, and even to make mistakes on which people can pick and
from which I and others can learn.

Anyway, I had thought to post this to the list, actually, but I think I take
up too much room there and I've failed once again to get my ideas in under a
paragraph, so this is for your pleasure.  I don't see why Henry or you don't
just start up another list, since if these issues that you feel are being
"banned" from the list are so valuable, and if Henry is the "passionate"
poet you believe he is, then no doubt the energy and interest is there to
make such a list thrive.  I would encourage that, in fact, in the interest
of "dialectic" since that's how things happen, how ideas are created.

I had more to write, but am getting rather tired.  Hope this fragment of an
idea makes sense.

Take care,
Brian

yes it's true in lit, in every field, and the above "inconclusive" evidence
is not inconclusive to me...

(note, in the following here "men" especially equals dominant culture i.e.
white men, esp middle-class-on-up white men, but not necessarily exclusively;
and, this doesn't apply to ALL men, of course, but is a general overview of
the situation...and here i am explaining and contextualizing, feeling a need
to protect myself before i even say what i have to say) (which is SO OBVIOUS
to so many people, and SO FOREIGN to many as well) (but how would you know if
you didn't _need_ to know?) (so thank you for asking, all you who _are_
asking, and thanks for being open, i hope, to what the answers are...)

(have i protected and disappeared myself enough inside these parentheses...)

1. it has been said that men expect to be understood, don't expect to be
questioned; whereas women expect to be questioned, can't assume they'll be
understood/trusted. (often women who DO have credentials etc are still
treated like dodos--yes, punning on both stupid and dead.)

2. it has been said that women tend to connect things, contextualize, and men
compartmentalize, separate, see things as distinct and unrelated. (if i hear
"that has nothing to do with it" one more time...well, i'll...i'll...i'll
explain how it does. or "that's beside the point"--well, beside the point may
well still be _part_ of the point, depending on just how big a thing we're
talking about.)

3. might makes right...right? (pppbbbttt, or the sound my tongue makes here)
(men have defined culture and experience for centuries. why shd they suddenly
have to explain where they fit into the structure when they ARE the
structure?)

4. a joke a friend recently emailed to me: two students, a man and a woman,
were asked to punctuate a sentence a teacher put on the chalkboard in english
class: "woman without man is incomplete"
the male student's response: "woman, without man, is incomplete"
the female student's response: "woman: without, man is incomplete"

hi judy--
i don't know the answers to your questions, unfortunately. people mostly
respond, mostly positively, to the pieces, usually engaging with them in some
sort of manner...tho there was the one person who walked by the mobile and
whacked it with an unconcerned shoulder...now that's interaction! some people
don't know how to _discover_ and want things to be "in order" for them in a
readily-discernible manner. others like to open the cart's boxes randomly,
walk around and around the mobile to see what there is to see...really it
varies, as you expected...
next time i show them i think i'll ask people more questions abt their
experiences w/the projects after i've watched them look, circle, open,
ignore...

hope that answers some of your questions...and generates new ones...

tom,
for me it's a little different w/a computer screen...i can't interact the
same way w/a computer as i can w/a 3-d object. and the repetitive stress
injuries i have and eyestrain i sometimes get also put a bit of a damper on
comparing it w/2-d objects.

to clarify, that's not to say that new ideas/new vistas _aren't_, as you
said, "available in the best web poetry pieces." it's just not my preferred
form of experiencing art/poetry/etc...

because of my preferences and injuries, i tend to use my computer time
primarily for for making 3-d printed objects (books, papers, etc),
storing/retrieving data, and some correspondence, usually
work/poetry-related. generally i know little abt web poetry pieces as i have
a cap to the amt of time i can use a computer, and well i have a limited amt
of time in my life too, and i'm behind on everything these days, except
getting my books done.

i know there are lots of announcements and site postings and etc for cool web
poetry on the list, and usually i copy them and eventually delete them as i
never have time to go to them. i'm interested in knowing if you'd send me
your top 5 or 10 places to check out. ok, 5. not 10... backchannel or front.
if not, well, maybe i'll just make a point of checking out some when i have
time and this time coincides with websites magically appearing before me, as
they so often do when i don't have time.

thanks very much,
jill stengel

obviously: women are well aware that society does not substantiate them, and so
feel they must 'prove' themselves/that they've been legitimized by this mans'
world. did you really just notice this? i think feminism might have something
to do with it ... analogous to women having to work twice as hard to get half
the notice. No, alas, we haven't come very far ...

The title of my post was "los desaparecidos", not "los
desaparicidos" or "los desaparacidos", as Tal alternately has
it. (A small thing, yes, and my apologies if her wayward vowels
were innocent typos, but before she writes any more tickets on the
term, Officer Tal may wish to make a note of the politically-correct
spelling.)

Which is not to say that Tal is not right in her general definition of the
phrase, as no doubt everyone on this List knows :
"los desaparecidos" famously refers to real or suspected dissidents
grabbed by death squads and government forces and never seen again.
Having lived and worked in two different
countries during times when the practice was fairly rampant, and
having spent a number of active years in the Central America
solidarity movement during the 80's, I am well aware of the term's
meaning and force. So, yes, in that my immediate reference was to
an aspect of this List's history, I was, indeed,
using it in the heavily figurative and ironic sense.

Specifically, I was alluding
to those whose voices have been (translated carefully now into English)
disappeared from the List for reasons not yet honestly acknowledged or
explained (i.e. those former "contrarious" participants who have been
denied access to the moderated post-'98 version). And I was alluding,
as well, to the obvious and embarrassing "disappearance," among
many of the self-proclaimed democrats and progressives here, of
any will to question this selective, strategic silencing.

Yes, the stakes on a poetry Listserv don't exactly compare to
those in late-70's Argentina. That's a no-brainer. But it sure is
interesting how --both here in virtuality and there in the midst of
dirty war-- those who ask where the bodies are and why invariably
get called "paranoid" by Good Citizens with curling lips.

Kent





---------------------------------------------
I find Kent Johnson expressions of paranoia not only tiresome but in
extremely poor taste.  "Los desaparicidos" is the term used for
folks
murdered by right-wing death squads and buried in ditches.  Seeing
those words appropriated to describe the alleged virtual hounding of
the likes of Henry Gould makes my stomach turn and my lip curl
the
same way it did when Clarence Thomas claimed he was the victim
of a
"lynching."  It's a rhetorical device of the lowest sort, and not in
the slightest bit amusing (to me) even if intended as irony.  Which
brings me to Gerald Schwartz' question about the perception of
humor.
Comedy is all a matter of perspective. Tadeusz Borowski wrote
stories
about the Holocaust that made me both laugh and cry; I resonate to
them and find them funny in the most painful way.  On the other
hand,
the old riddle about the difference between a Jew and a pizza hits
me
at about the same level as Johnson's use of "los desaparacidos".
As
we were all instructed back in kindergarten:  it's the difference
between laughing *with* and laughing *at*.  Not really that hard a
concept to grasp. Seems like just about any joke can be
understood in
terms of the "we" and the "them" it creates.

Well, it's sort of hard to separate "the poet" from "poetics" and
"poetry," but how about Frank O'Hara's "Personism"?

Glad to see that Kali and I are on the same side of an issue.

Since my "confusion" has become an issue here, I must say that I have
a nagging doubt about Henry Gould's existence, after the Kent
Johnson/Yasusada stuff and all.  I'm assuming that Henry is indeed a
flesh and blood person, that others on the list have seen him, talked
to him?

Freedom of speech versus verbal abuse/censorship versus protection of
others--the lines of demarcation are sloppy and there will never be
any agreement here.

And I should add that in a past message I wasn't intending to attack
Elizabeth Treadwell.  If it sounded that way, please forgive my
oafish email style.

I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

we are together in this place
i want to scratch and claw my face
i want to tear this skin from bone
i want to travel kill and roam
to want is fury and to take
to kill the want so peace to make
if peace is made my hands are clean
in this dead world men are obscene
health doctor is for you not me
my life won't end so peacefully
i want to scratch those violent eyes
that tend to catch me by surprise
i take my nails against my face
my eyes shall never have a place
there are no plans no homes no love
my eyes are gouged and blind above
love can't been seen so that my eyes
have seen the last of human skies
i cannot tell and cannot speak
i am the purest of the meek
i am the purest of the mind
i've left my sight and love behind
behind this world and any other
behind all humans and their bothers
i want to tear away the clothes and mask
that covers us, no easy task
i wanted to almost from birth
when i could see the filthy earth
i stormed myself and everyone
at first with rocks and then with guns
my life is gone, there's nothing left
of all my senses, sight's bereft
my friends were taken by surprise
i took my love, gave them my eyes
so many weapons, doctor, here,
i'm stopping here, be of no fear

Hi Everyone,

Yet another request for help. I'm putting up a link list of webzines and
other literary sites to accompany Readme #3, which will include a special
feature devoted to webzine/litsite editors. The link list is currently
housed at:

http://www.jps.net/nada/litlink.htm

and I'm desperately trying to gather more ... BUT NEED YOUR HELP!!! Please
alert me to non-mainstream litsites & webzines (e.g., NOT Academy of
American Poets) not currently included ... and don't be shy; if you run one,
tell me about it (including the URL).

Many kind thanks,

THE POETRY CENTER & AMERICAN POETRY ARCHIVES
Presents

ANNE CARSON
Thursday February 24, 7:30 pm, $5
@ The Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin (at Geary)

A classics scholar thoroughly in touch with the subtleties of contemporary
poetry, Anne Carson several years ago appeared with a brilliant work on the
intimacies of classic Greek poetry, Eros the Bittersweet.  *  More
recently, few books of contemporary poetry have enjoyed the audience
afforded her "novel in verse," Autobiography of Red.  * Her other works
include Glass, Irony and God and Plainwater: Essays & Poems.  *  Ms. Carson
is the visiting Holloway Lecturer at UC Berkeley this spring semester.  *
Her latest critical work, Economy of the Unlost, analyzes the poetics of
Paul Celan and Simonides of Keos, and is just out from Princeton, and her
opera installation-The Mirror of Simple Souls-can be viewed at
www.ummu.umich.edu/projects/souls.  *  She lives in Montr=E9al, Qu=E9bec. *

"Anne Carson is, for me, the most exciting poet writing in English today"

Dear Poetics,

I recently joined the list and have been following with interest the
thread on gender and public speech.  It seems to me a good
moment to announce this Call for Responses to the Forum topic
for HOW2/n4, on "Experimentation in Critical Style."  If you'd like
to take a look at the Forum currently featured on the HOW2 website--
issue 2 explores "Class and Innovative Writing"--you can point your
browser at:

http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/current/index.html

The forum questions for issue 4 follow below.  I hope that many of you will
contribute, and please pass the call on to others who might be interested.

best,

Mytili Jagannathan
mytilij@english.upenn.edu

HOW2/n4 CALL FOR RESPONSES: EXPERIMENTATION AND CRITICAL STYLE

For forum 4, Mytili Jagannathan and Elisabeth Joyce propose questions on
stylistic experimentation in critical writing.  Your email response is
invited--from 1 paragraph to 2 pages in length--and, if selected for
on-line inclusion, must be re/sent to the guest editors as an attached
file, formatted in MAC/ Word 5.1.

Responses should be addressed to <ejoyce@erie.net> and
<mytilij@english.upenn.edu>.

----------------------------------------------

Taking risks in critical writing often seems impermissible for those of us
seeking jobs, tenure, promotion, and most telling, publication. At the
same time, many of us are fascinated by more experimental forms of
expression
and desire to participate in critical writing that is more riveting,
evocative, and
boldly playful, making use of innovations that are not only permitted but
often
valorized in the poetry that we, as critics and readers, discuss.  Given the
extreme pressures to publish in academia, most writers in academic contexts
feel compelled to conform to certain styles of writing, with their attention
focused especially on the audience of reviewers who ultimately determine
whether or not an article is eligible for publication in "juried" and
traditionally
targeted print journals.

What are the risks and rewards of carrying the innovative project over into
our forms of critical discourse?  We are interested particularly in how
this dilemma is experienced and negotiated by women in various stages of
their professional and writing lives. What are the models of critical
style available to us? Do women feel pressure to conform to certain styles
in
order to survive in this profession? If they do not, what makes it
possible for them to write in another way? Is audience the determining
factor
for their style, and if so, how do they envision this audience? Is inclusion
of
the personal a taboo, an innovation, or has it been worn out by overuse?
And, as importantly, how has the proliferation of online publications
changed assumptions about public intellectual exchange, and transformed
the parameters for critical dialogue?

Moving to New York from Japan to join Fluxus, Shigeko Kubota crossed
paths with the Father of Video Art, Nam June Paik, in the 1960's.
Since then, they have supported eachother's work in Film and Video
through frequent collaborations.  Chief among these is "Allan 'n'
Allen's Complaint," 1982. Although they were married in 1970, their
rally to the introduction of sexual values in hi-art forms can be
traced from Kubota's "Vagina Painting," 19 65, performed by Kubota, and
Nam June Paik's "TV Bra," made renown by Charlotte Moorman.


"Sexual Healing" continues Kubota's objective use of sexually charged
content while documenting the everyday life she shares with her
husband, Nam June Paik. Kubota has focussed all of her energy on the
rehabilitation of her husband.since his stroke in 1996.  In a loving
homage she allows the art world to witness their unique relationship
and its innovations and adaptations to life. Sculptures and industrial
banisters set in the gallery are appropriations of objects that have
proliferated the couple's home and workspace in real life.  A funky
hospital bed in a corner, an awkward wheelchair central to the space, a
creation of a clinical hospital window, video flowers, sculptures of
the artist and her husband proudly standing side by side, projections
over the entire scene with colorful images of the pair engaged in daily
activities, support a single channel video of Paik flirting with all of
his young rehab therapists titled "Sexual Healing."


Over the decades, Kubota has focussed her work on men who have greatly
influenced her and have won her respect. Her Duchampiana series
developed a critical homage to Marcel Duchamp during the 70's and 80's.
Inaugurating Lance Fung Gallery's new space at 537 Broadway with a 1996
solo exhibition, Kubota took George Maciunas, her long time friend, as
a focus of the exhibition because the space had originally been
Maciunas's home. Kubota exhibited her own black and white video footage
of Maciunas walking through SoHo in 1976 intercut with new color video
of botanical sites. In Sexual Healing Kubota employs her customary
balance of insight and objectification while executing a poignant yet
touching homage to a great figure much closer to heart. Although the
focus is on love and compassion between two people faced with a
significant obstacle the exhibition escapes trivializing this
situation, giving us a glimpse at the ingenuity and flexibility
necessary to removing barriers within life and art.. Kubota offers this
visionary duo's approach to art as an extension of healing.


The concurrent retrospective of Nam June Paik's work on view at the
uptown Guggenheim Museum in New York allows "Sexual Healing" a unique
added dimension.

A query or two:

In frustrating circumstance--ReMap may stop publishing.
Now the reason being lack of interest --or apparent--by  subscribers.
Carolyn Kemp and I are most aware that this magazine --as many
others--should be and is (has been) an act of generosity and dialoged
poetics. We still seek to engage a dialogue regarding the poetics
  discussions started years ago (1989) at New College--but--feel lost.
  We've just published #7 (On LOVE) and besides the magazines we've sent
out to writers and friends-- no one asks for any. NOR do we engender that
dialogue we seek to--meaning-- poets do not write us or each other (at
least not to our knowledge) regarding the work we publish.

I'm posing a few questions to help us understand either where to go or
"where to go"!

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?

2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.

3) What purpose should/does a poetics magazine have?



I know these should like "beginner's questions"--but they should be. After
all, for Carolyn and I--we need reasons.


yrs,

Todd Baron

As irregularly sent out, these are statistics
of Poetics List subscribership, organized by
country. The usual disclaimers apply: namely,
that the Listserv program attributes to any
address that does not terminate in a country
code (e.g., CA for Canada) U.S. origin.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began (at under
100 subscribers). All submissions are reviewed by the moderators
in keeping with the goals of the list, as articulated in this
Welcome Message. We remain committed to this editorial function
as a defining element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support,
inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the list administrators at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All messages
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to
query if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the editors regarding
submissions to the list remains confidential and should be
directed to us at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate; if
responses are received backchannel and are of interest to the
list (i.e., if they are on topic), we suggest that the posting
subscriber may wish to assemble "highlights" from respondents'
messages to be published to the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or want to
thank someone for posting something you requested, please send
the request or comment directly to that individual, and not to
the list or to the list editors.

In general, please use "common sense" when posting and keep in
mind that your message, if forwarded, will be distributed to 800+
persons the world over.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <POETICS@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Format of Email Messages - PLEASE READ

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text".
The use of "styled" text or HTML formatting in the body of
messages sent to the list appears not to be compatible with
the Listserv's automatic digest and archive features; as a
result, inclusion of HTML tags disrupts the list archive
and may have a similarly pernicious effect on the digest
form of the list. Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format.

Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator users take note!
You may need to specify "plain text" or "ASCII text" or "text only"
in the outgoing messages section of your application Preferences.
Check your application's Edit | Preferences or Help menus for
further details.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

-------------------

5. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Submissions to the list should be in ASC-II (text-only) format
and should contain NO HTML TAGS! HTML tags interfere with the
automatic digest and archive functions of the listserv program,
and will not be forwarded to the list. Subscribers using
Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Communicator and like applications
to manage their email service should check the "Preferences"
or "Options" section of the program in question to be sure that
HTML formatting options are disabled before posting to the list.

Attachments may not be sent to the Poetics List. Messages
containing attachments will be presumed to be worm- or virus-
carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use."

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

6. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

7. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<LISTSERV@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

8. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

9. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

10. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

11. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

I agree to some extent with a lot of what you say, especially the
disclaimer. But, at the same time, I think the above disclaimer goes a
far piece as well in what I think about.

It would be interesting to know when people feel they are part of the
"men" who have created/enjoyed this dominant culture (and people in this
case wouldn't necessarily be only men, as you've brought up issues of
race and class, which are prolly just as important here?). Much more
often I think we (people, not men) have the feelings below...

here I have a problem: "men have defined... why shd they..." I think as
many a man feels ensnared in this "dominant" culture that has painted
them into a set of roles and actions. I would say most men don't feel
they are the alpha male all around and are often looking over their
shoulder at that bigger fish that's gonna put them in their "place." (A
man's place is working for/trying to please another man?) Men are no
more free-ranging than women in "options," unless you look at a small
subset of what they "can" do and exclude a whole other range of
experience. I suppose one could look at another small subset of
experience and show how free-ranging women are, but has anybody
investigated this?

I just like this. Revise the joke in the future so that the man
capitalizes "woman" and puts a period at the end of the sentence?

I agree with the author of the above, and would add to that, that a good
deal of my energy in this lifetime has gone to attempting to dispel the
miasma of malehood they pumped into my nursery and kept on pumping until
little by little women--mostly women--pried a window up and started to
clear matters up for me (and for themselves, and why not!). It requires a
good deal of consciousness and i know i am unconscious most of the time.
But I have attempted to show the other side not only to myself but to other
men. And now I am glad that Jamie Perez also shows an _other_ side.

In this question of gender roles, we all need all the help we can extend
and receive. I welcome Jill Stengel's post and, like Jamie, find myself in
substantial agreement with what she says.

It has everything to do with poetry, which is the theory of
heartbreak--which always stems from mistaken assumptions and inability to
imagine how it looks from the other's standpoint.

I was hoping to be able to reply backchannel but never got my thoughts
sufficiently organized - sorry.  So here it is.
     I think we are basically in agreement, but what I was trying to get
at with the Kristeva quote was [the importance of sujectivity] as a
"signifying function [that is] refused by our culture by consigning it
to the domain of art" and therefore of no consequence in our objective
social world.  This would then seem to me a call for subjectivity that
comes out of the objectivity.  As this is not my field I may well be
missing some points along the way?

Dear Todd:

As you know, I've published Inscape (7 issues) for a couple of years now and
that's withering on the vine for a lack of interest, too.
It seems to me that when our readership is composed mainly of poets and
other editors, those poets and editors expect to receive complimentary
copies, and if a poet's work is not being published by a particular mag they
may not see much point in subscribing to it because it isn't honoring the
work that they're most interested in (their own).
I also think that magazines like ReMap and Inscape, which are produced in a
manner that is affordable for the publisher to make and distribute without
much, if any ,additional support from the government or subscribers, are not
as attractive to the poetry community as perfect bound journals which
resemble commodities/commercial products of mass reproduction.
And, if you'll permit me a personal observation, you solicited work from me
for ReMap but never responded as to whether that work had been accepted or
not. I know of another magazine, to which I was the 7th subscriber ever,
signing up for a 3 year subscription, who similarly does not respond to
solicited work or even send me the copies I paid for as a subscriber! So
there's the matter of personal incompetence to consider when analyzing the
eventual failure of a project.
In the case of Inscape I've started a new, more narrowly focused, project
taking this stuff into consideration.

re todd baron:

 How bout a web site? I actually get orders and letters every now and then
and actually more and more from my very lowtech one.

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?

Tripwire. Ixnay. Kenning. Poetry Project Newsletter. I think The Germ and
the Hat, actually I think 6ix too. Chain's run out after a few years. Easily
(comparatively at least) available at stores.

2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.

interesting vital work (what a boring answer huh?). women (frankly if its
more than half men i don't have the time). a decent design is nice too,
however cheaply done. actually i find it kinda essential.

re jamie perez:
>here I have a problem: "men have defined... why shd they..." I think as

but seriously, haven't men defined it? women have influenced it perhaps, and
maybe are even secretly ruling the world, right, yay. but did you know Sarah
Fielding was more respected and more popular in her lifetime than her bro
Henry? (source: Mothers of the Novel, Dale Spender) Does that count as
disappeared? Censored? On any non-dead level? It is political, you won't
change my mind there.

And like, I dunno, have we HAD any girl presidents?

I know men don't feel like god all the time, I do sometimes , etc. But that
doesn't take care of the free-range or the f**ked up ness.


I will find the thrilling quote from one of SF's novels to post here; I
passed the book on......

How bout this for a title? THE FEMALE QUIXOTE (1752) by Charlotte Lennox.
Rockin.

Keystroke Program


Diary note: "I also have written again with the old Compaq machine, using
the program that registers keystrokes - it's fascinating watching a
literal recording of actions, not corrected content (something like the
interior of a ytalk conversation)."

But it's more than that, it's a recording of muscle, of entries, not of
results - it's the movement of the fingers on the keys, and that is all -
it is the dance of phonemics, not the play of syntax or semantic flow.
Literally, in other words, the body. So there is a double expression -
that of the movement of language, and its interpretation, and that of the
body laboring through sequences of entries.

And here, what could be more visible than the actions of the body?

cd pcplus pcplus shell sondheim qls test test tf test zz test ls test test
man texst qls pico zz# And here, what could be more visible than the
actions of the body? b ls cd .. dir b keys.dat keys.fix keysfix dir date
>> keys.fix dir dir >> keys.fix exit del keys.fix

There is a degree of hemming and hawing in human existence, shuttling back
and forth - the final speech and its rationale are only a residue - even
the breathing, coffee breaks, sighing, aren't recorded - not to mention
the need for digestion, excretion, sleep above all - the keystroke program
however is a first step - kinesic recording - each and every movement -
each and every stroke - it doesn't like - it takes the poetry out of the
poetry, product out of the product, prose out of the prose, theory out of
the theory - it hints at a substrate - at least part of the substrate is
brought to the surface - it's a kind of mimicry (i.e. it locks onto the
product, it continues, abandons, the product) - these are the foundations
- shifting themselves -

Todd,

While I may not be answering your question directly (or at all), I
have encountered many of the same problems with the duration chapbook
series. Beyond the small handful of subscribers, & the freebies I send
out, the response to the series is almost nil. Makes me wonder how
many people are actually interested in what happens beyond our
American poetic borders. In response, or in addition to your post,
perhaps I should also post the questions:

1) What anthologies / collections / etc. of poetry in translation have
you recently purchased.

2) Does the work of poets from other countries (specifically
non-English speaking countries) have any importance to your own work.

3) What purpose does, or should, the publication of works in
translation have, if any.

I don't want to sound like I am complaining, but am feeling somewhat
discouraged by the whole thing, & wonder if anyone actually cares for,
or is interested in, works in translation.

Bests,

Jerrold

The issue you raise concerning artists doing multi-media for corporations by day
and then doing net.art by night is an interesting one.

Carl Stalling did the sound/music for the Warner Bros. cartoons. To judge from
remarks by Chuck Jones, one of the main producers, Stalling just did a job and
nobody really bothered much about the relation of what they were doing to art.
Now Stalling is seen as a musical innovator, and John Zorn has said that the
great innovation of twentieth century music is cartoon music.

Stalling lived in a different time than ours. I remember, prior to the Web,
thinking that it was such a different time, one in which Stalling could produce
innovative art without really being terribly conscious of it, and do it for a
big company, no less. But the medium was relatively new and leaping. And America
was a different place, or people thought of it and themselves differently,
didn't examine the sorts of questions we're looking at right at this moment. If
it was not a state of innocence, then it was a time of worldly triumph and
apparent benevolence.

Now we look closely to see how deeply informed the art might be by service to
the corporate and all that goes with it.

I grew up in the old economy of writing, ie, no pay at all. Though I am starting
to find that people are interested in paying me for my Web art and also for my
knowledge of aspects of computer technology and the Internet. Which is quite a
change. Of course, there are young writers/artists/web artists/net.wurkers
coming into this time with different expectations about how to proceed as an
artist. So that, as you point out, some do multi-media work by day for company x
or y and by night feverishly produce their own net.work.

Are we returning to a time something like Stalling's that way? I would not wish
on writers/artists that they experience the unremitting denial of place in
society that seems to have accompanied the life of writing for some time, for
most. I would wish that poetry and net.work could be appreciated and inform the
life of the culture in a full bodied manner.  And that artists, rather than
simply endorsing a corporate mentality and art, can pick their way through the
attendant land minds and produce work that is widely read and is deeply relevant
to the time.

This is asking a lot I realize!

On second thought, it's not congruent with the way things go, to expect that,
though the desire for it may be understandable. We dodge through the machine
like Chaplin. But, unlike Chaplin, we try to retain our humanity while picking
up parts of the machine and attaching them to us. Do we then finally become
indistinguishable from the machine or do we do something else? Like find the
human dimensions of the appendage, come to infuse it with the human? And our
nature changes a bit also in the process, perhaps not so much *just* toward some
mechanical nature, some inhuman thing but, instead, something post human?
Different but perhaps no less empathic and aware? It does seem that the relation
of oneself or the human to the machine, and how one handles that, what one makes
of that, is important in much of the net.work being done.

And the corporation, near corporealization of the machine in a larger aspect. A
question, in part, of voice problems. Like whose is it? The person's or the
corporation's, the person's or the machine's?

The feeling that it's necessary to be an outsider in order to produce fully
thoughtful and conscious, authentic, committed work, this feeling tells us about
the state of the culture, the viscious state. I am interested in visual
language. When I look at the visual language of indigenous cultures, I see whole
languages, whole cultures of image and story and song and the makers of the
works did not need to be outsiders. Their visual language makes ours look
forlorn and idiosyncratic, isolated and alienated from the society.

There is a sense in the work of many cyberpoets of working on the ABC's of a new
art. That of course draws from previous art. Heavily. Toward a synthesis of arts
and also of programming. Toward a visual and a sonic, a multi-media sensibility
that is full in its range of literary and experiential possibility, that is not
reduced to the state of the machine but, on the contrary, can speak to
contemporary experience with depth and range.

I do see the art of the coming years moving closer to a synthesis of word and
image and sound, more fully of the sensorium and all the dimensions of language.
There will be other work, of course, as usual, but my own interest is primarily
otherwise because that's the work I'm pursuing myself. I still read and there
are many books of poetry that are important to me, but I had problems with the
print world way before the Internet came along and am happy to be able to
publish without waiting on someone else's say so.

There is a certain ecstasy to this, and a certain trepidation. Not so much a
hubris as a risk of one's humanity. But it seems that we are all dodging through
the machine, whether we're doing web art or not. Print poets too.

The issue you raise is pointed. How much is just a global commercialization that
is more about salesmanship and flash rather than more meaningful gestures?
Currently on webartery, an email list I participate in, there's plenty of
discussion of this. Some see the old artworld stealing into the net and dragging
along all the accoutrements of the museums and the subjugation of art and
artists onto the net. Others point out that the sort of corporate need for Web
art, or at least 'multi-media', is no safer a place for artists than within the
tired institutions of the old art world.

Still, for all this, the art itself is young and leaping.

Nor do I look at Weak Blood as a failure. Quite the contrary. But in the regard
you mentioned, ie, critical perspective on the war, well this is not the strong
point of the site. But it is resounding in its denounciation of NATO having
acted as it did, which is probably the most important thing about the statement,
given that it was from a widely international collection of digital artists.

 So I

Well Rhizome, as you know, is quite widely international. I am not all that
familiar with the international flavours of the collectives, though I do a lot
of surfing of the sites of individuals, and my links page at vispo.com is pretty
good that way. Chuck Sheppard recently pointed out http://glassdog.net to me,
and this page is at first glance impressive in that it lists collectives and it
lists lots of them. Funny, it's maintained by an individual who won't list the
sites of individuals.  http://nettime.org/ is also quite international, but you
probably know that well.

That's WWW.M9NDFUKC.COM . I've got a listing at http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm

One book I'd single out as challenging my sense of what masculinity is, is
_Triton_ (now published as _Trouble on Triton_) by Samuel R. Delany. That's
a book whose lessons I think I will be trying to learn the rest of my life.

Anyone -- or everyone -- else read it?

Mt. Kisco, NY:  The Creative Arts Café Poetry Series at the Northern
Westchester Center for the Arts celebrates Black
History Month with  poet, storyteller and singer Karen Wilson.   Karen
Wilson will perform selections of poetry and
songs, including her original work, Monday, Feb. 28th at 7:30 PM.  A
reception, book signing and open mike follow
each reading.

Karen Wilson is the recipient of a BRIO Fellowship from the Bronx
Council of the Arts. She is storyteller -in- residence through Arts in
Education at Elizabeth Morrow School in Englewood, NJ.
She is a performer with wide
appeal, enthralling children, teenagers and adults alike.  Her
performances include Ain’t I A Woman: African American
Women Reflect American History,  for the “Meet the Artist Series” at
Lincoln Center in New York City;  Celebrate the Earth
(ATIS) at the Children’s Museum in Manhattan; and Songs, Stories  and
Whatnot for Grownups at Speakeasy in NYC. She
has also created works  and performed for The Harlem School of the Arts
and Clearwater’s Hudson River Revival. In 1998,
NWCA featured Karin Wilson’s performance of Beauty and the Blues -the
Prose and Poems,  an adaptation of her popular
 performance, Beauty and the Blues, which premiered at the Hudson
RiverMuseum in February 1997. Through songs and
stories, Karen Wilson recreates the realities of African people: whether
on their home continent or as they and
 their descendants moved to new homes across the Western Hemisphere. In
the way that African fabrics embrace many colors
and African musics embrace many sounds, Karen embraces many different
cultures in her storytelling. Her stories touch issues
of family and community, relationships in conflict, the importance of
responsibility and the power of change. Come and listen:
your laughing and clapping will make you part of the event in true
African fashion.
 You may even find yourself singing in one of Karen’s thirteen singing
languages right along with her! Karen is a performer with

The Nation

May 22, 1989

[In April of 1989, Pulitzer Prize winning writer Alice
Walker delivered this poetic address in support of the
National March for Women's Equality and Women's Lives
in Washington D.C. The march, held a few months after
the Supreme Court agreed to review a case involving a
restrictive Missouri abortion law, was meant to demonstrate
support for safe and legal abortion. Reprinted in The Nation
on May 22, Walker's essay surveys the history of relations
between white men and black women in America and questions
the right of white lawmakers to make decisions about black
women's lives.]

What Can the White Man Say to the Black Woman?

by Alice Walker

What is of use in these words I offer in memory of our
common mother. And to my daughter.

What can the white man say to the black woman?

For four hundred years he ruled over the black woman's womb.

Let us be clear. In the barracoons and along the slave
shipping coasts of Africa, for more than twenty generations,
it was he who dashed our babies brains out against the
rocks.

What can the white man say to the black woman?

For four hundred years he determined which black woman's
children would live or die.

Let it be remembered. It was he who placed our children on
the auction block in cities all across the eastern half of
what is now the United States, and listened to and watched
them beg for their mothers' arms, before being sold to the
highest bidder and dragged away.

What can the white man say to the black woman?

We remember that Fannie Lou Hamer, a poor sharecropper on a
Mississippi plantation, was one of twenty-one children; and
that on plantations across the South black women often had
twelve, fifteen, twenty children. Like their enslaved
mothers and grandmothers before them, these black women were
sacrificed to the profit the white man could make from
harnessing their bodies and their children's bodies to the
cotton gin.

What can the white man say to the black woman?

We see him lined up on Saturday nights, century after
century, to make the black mother, who must sell her body to
feed her children, go down on her knees to him.

Let us take note:

He has not cared for a single one of the dark children in
his midst, over hundreds of years.

Where are the children of the Cherokee, my great
grandmother's people?

Gone.

Where are the children of the Blackfoot?

Gone.

Where are the children of the Lakota?

Gone.

Of the Cheyenne?

Of the Chippewa?

Of the Iroquois?

Of the Sioux?

Of the Mandinka?

Of the Ibo?

Of the Ashanti?

Where are the children of the "Slave Coast" and Wounded
Knee?

We do not forget the forced sterilizations and forced
starvations on the reservations, here as in South Africa.
Nor do we forget the smallpox-infested blankets Indian
children were given by the Great White Fathers of the United
States government.

What has the white man to say to the black woman?

When we have children you do everything in your power to
make them feel unwanted from the moment they are born. You
send them to fight and kill other dark mothers' children
around the world. You shove them onto public highways in the
path of oncoming cars. You shove their heads through plate
glass windows. You string them up and you string them out.

What has the white man to say to the black woman?

>From the beginning, you have treated all dark children with
absolute hatred.

Thirty million African children died on the way to the
Americas, where nothing awaited them but endless toil and
the crack of a bullwhip. They died of a lack of food, of
lack of movement in the holds of ships. Of lack of friends
and relatives. They died of depression, bewilderment and
fear.

What has the white man to say to the black woman?

Let us look around us: Let us look at the world the white
man has made for the black woman and her children.

It is a world in which the black woman is still forced to
provide cheap labor, in the form of children, for the
factories and on the assembly lines of the white man.

It is a world into which the white man dumps every foul,
person-annulling drug he smuggles into creation.

It is a world where many of our babies die at birth, or
later of malnutrition, and where many more grow up to live
lives of such misery they are forced to choose death by
their own hands.

What has the white man to say to the black woman, and to all
women and children everywhere?

Let us consider the depletion of the ozone; let us consider
homelessness and the nuclear peril; let us consider the
destruction of the rain forests_in the name of the almighty
hamburger. Let us consider the poisoned apples and the
poisoned water and the poisoned air and the poisoned earth.

And that all of our children, because of the white man's
assault on the planet, have a possibility of death by cancer
in their almost immediate future.

What has the white, male lawgiver to say to any of us? To
those of us who love life too much to willingly bring more
children into a world saturated with death?

Abortion, for many women, is more than an experience of
suffering beyond anything most men will ever know; it is an
act of mercy, and an act of self-defense.

To make abortion illegal again is to sentence millions of
women and children to miserable lives and even more
miserable deaths.

Given his history, in relation to us, I think the white man
should be ashamed to attempt to speak for the unborn
children of the black woman. To force us to have children
for him to ridicule, drug and turn into killers and homeless
wanderers is a testament to his hypocrisy.

What can the white man say to the black woman?

Only one thing that the black woman might hear.

Yes, indeed, the white man can say, Your children have the
right to life. Therefore I will call back from the dead
those 30 million who were tossed overboard during the
centuries of the slave trade. And the other millions who
died in my cotton fields and hanging from trees.

I will recall all those who died of broken hearts and broken
spirits, under the insult of segregation.

I will raise up all the mothers who died exhausted after
birthing twenty-one children to work sunup to sundown on my
plantation. I will restore to full health all those who
perished for lack of food, shelter, sunlight, and love; and
from my inability to see them as human beings.

But I will go even further:

I will tell you, black woman, that I wish to be forgiven the
sins I commit daily against you and your children. For I
know that until I treat your chil dren with love, I can
never be trusted by my own. Nor can I respect myself.

And I will free your children from insultingly high infant
mortality rates, short life spans, horrible housing, lack of
food, rampant ill health. I will liberate them from the
ghetto. I will open wide the doors of all the schools and
hospitals and businesses of society to your children. I will
look at your children and see not a threat but a joy.

I will remove myself as an obstacle in the path that your
children, against all odds, are making toward the light. I
will not assassinate them for dreaming dreams and offering
new visions of how to live. I will cease trying to lead your
children, for I can see I have never understood where I was
going. I will agree to sit quietly for a century or so, and
meditate on this.

This is what the white man can say to the black woman.

We are listening.

Well this clarifies for me why I find all of this so confusing.  Someone
says "objective" and I think "but that's what I mean by subjective" and
vice versa.

What Patrick refers to as the male no-self I think of as the not-just-male
but unfortunately human Self, or is it SELF, that is, the confusion of
storyline with reality, which I guess men receive more cultural
encouragement in cultivating, while what Patrick refers to as the female
belief in the value of bias and personality seems to me to be an
appreciation of and understanding of the limits of this storyline and
humility before the impossibility of avoiding it, again this is not gender
specific, but I guess it's more socially acceptable for women, yes? she
says tentatively thus showing she has learned her gender roles if not well
at least a little.

I still don't know what objective and subjective mean.  Meaning: I know the
dictionary meaning but in practice it all seems to collapse in on itself.
But this self/no-self thing seems to have more handles.

Since Ginsberg it's well established that someone can make a million dollars

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?
2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.
3) What purpose should/does a poetics magazine have?

Hi Todd,

I'd love a copy of the Love issue of ReMap, and would be willing to trade
books, or chaps for it, if you'd like. Backchannel me & we can talk about it
more.

As for your questions, the truth is, I don't subscribe to any poetics (or
poetry) magazines, largely due to lack of funds. I usually trade. Basically,
I read Shark. Most of what I get/trade for are poetry mags or chapbooks, not
poetics mags.

To be totally honest, *most* of what I read w/respect to contemporary poetry
is online. (I have lots of time at work to do this, or at the very least, to
print things out.) And there are at least a few mags devoted solely or
partially to poetics online that I've really found valuable:

Arras: Brian Kim Stefans mag, which has a few interviews and essays.
Callaloo: Which you can't get unless you subscribe to it (I can get it
because I have a Columbia University email, and the University library
subscribes to it).
The East Village Web: Mostly poetry, but Jack Kimball is starting to publish
poetics essays as well.
How2: Probably the best online devoted to mostly poetics; it also includes
new poetry.
Jacket: John Tranter's mag has lots of interviews, essays and reviews.
Lagniappe: Graham Foust and Benjamin Friedlander's mag is mostly reviews and
includes a few broader essays and letter exchanges.
Readme: The mag I do, which is predominantly interviews, essays and reviews,
with some poetry by people contributing secondary material.

Most poetics journals -- at least the ones I've run across -- tend to be
either too conservative or too academic (which, as I'm using the term
"academic," means pretty much the same thing) for my tastes, so I don't
bother with them.

As for question #2, important or needed would mean that the magazines
include discussions of work that I'm generally interested in. Also, that
they offer something more than PR. I don't mean that they can't be
overwhelmingly positive. But, I guess there has to be, for me, some sense
that the writers are really engaged with the work they're writing about.
This may be another reason I tend to shy away from what I'd call more
"academic" poetics journals: I don't have the sense that the authors are
engaged so much in the writing under discussion as much as the various
critical frameworks they're looking at the text(s) through. Obviously,
that's arguable. We all look through various frames. But, I guess what I
mean is that I have to have the sense that whatever does come up, in the
review or overview or whatever, comes from the work examined. I realize
that, you know what? It's been kind of a long time since I've read a really
good poetics essay that wasn't involved with a specific other work, or set
of works: in other words, a kind of "general" poetics essay. It may be that
I kind of avoid manifestos; I don't know. Totalizing pronouncements, while
they may be of great value to any poet who writes them, may not be so
valuable to me, unless I'm really studying that poet's work at the time.

As for question #3, I can't speak for anyone else's purpose; just that I
guess it would have to sustain whoever's doing the magazine. For my own
magazine, the purpose is to get poets talking about their own and others'
work. Whether or not I'm interested in the poet's work, the interview, if
it's "successful," tends to deepen my familiarization with that person, or
maybe provides more of a context for their work than I had before. As I
said, I don't like totalizing propositions about What Poetry Is or What
Poetry Should Do, and tend not to respond to that; more to people describing
what feeds and/or drives them. Art history doesn't really interest me
anymore, either, so historicization of one's writing (or another's) also
tends to leave me cold.

The ideal poetics journal, for me, would be one where you've got very close
readings of various texts, and pieces that deepened my sense of the context
in which any one particular poet might be writing (their "life").

It's a drag that you haven't had much response to the magazine lately. I get
a lot of response to mine, but I think that's because the medium is
conducive to immediate response--so I do get a lot of email, probably from
people who are at the site while they're writing me. I'm embarrassed to
admit that I haven't written a through-the-mails letter in at least a year,
probably longer, and I used to do that a lot. ...

Anyway, I don't know if this adds anything, helps, or what. But I'd love to
hear what others have to say about the various poetics journals they read
... especially if anyone knows of any great ones online I've missed (or
wants to send me copies of their in-print ones!) ...

Yours,

Gary Sullivan

Rectification of Names, (De) Rectification of Rectification


Confucius, Analects, XIII iii, translation Legge:

1. Tsze-lu said, 'The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with
you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing
to be done?'
2. The Master replied, 'What is necessary is to rectify names.'
3. 'So, indeed!' said Tsze-lu. 'You are wide of the mark! Why must there
be such rectification?'
4. The Master said, 'How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in
regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve.
5. 'If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth
of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things,
affairs cannot be carried on to success.
6. 'When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music
will not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments
will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded,
the people do not know how to move hand or foot.
7. 'Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses
may be spoken _appropriately,_ and also that what he speaks may be carried
out _appropriately._ What the superior man requires, is just that in his
words there may be nothing incorrect.'

Hsun Tzu, from Rectifying Names, translation Watson:

[If there are no fixed names,] but men begin to discriminate the different
forms of things on the basis of their own particular observations, each
applying his own names and interpreting the different phenomena in his own
fashion, then the relationships between names and realities will become
obscured and entangled, the distinction between eminent and humble will
become unclear, and men will no longer discriminate properly between
things that are the same and those that are different. [...]

And how does one go about distinguishing between things that are the same
and those that are different? One relies upon the senses. Things which are
of the same species and form will be apprehended by the senses as being
all the same thing. [...] In this way one arrives at a common name for
all the things of one class, which everyone agrees to use when the
occasion demands. [...]

The myriad beings of creation are countless, and yet at times we wish to
refer to all of them in general, and so we call them "things." "Things" is
the broadest general term. [...] One starts with the broadest possible
term and moves on to terms whose meaning is more and more circumscribed
until one can go no farther, and there one stops.

Names have no intrinsic appropriateness. One agrees to use a certain name
and issues an order to that effect, and if the agreement is abided by and
becomes a matter of custom, then the name may be said to be appropriate,
but if people do not abide by the agreement, then the name ceases to be
appropriate. Names have no intrinsic reality. [...]

Names are used when the reality itself is not clearly understood. Combin-
ations of names are used when single names alone are not understood. [...]

Names are the means by which one attempts to distinguish different reali-
ties. [...] Discourses and explanations are the means by which, without
allowing names to become separated from realities, one makes men under-
stand the principles of correct action. Names and combinations of names
are the instruments of discourse and explanation. Discourse and explana-
tion are the means by which the mind gives form to the Way. [...]

Kung-Sun Lung-Tzu, from Chuh wu lun, Designation of Things (probably
spurious), translation Perleberg:

1. Guest: "There is not a thing which cannot be designated. Designations,
however, are undesignated."
2. Host: "If there are no designations in the world, things cannot be
called things."
3. Host: If there is no designation, (how) could things in this world be
called designated?"
4. Guest: "Designation is not of this world. Things, are of this world. It
is not possible to accept that which exists in the world for that which
does not exist."
5. Host: "In the world being no designation, then things can never be said
to be designated."
6. Host: "If they cannot be called designated, there is no designation."
[...]

ibid., full text of Ming shih lun, Discourse on Names and their Actual
Significance:

1. "Heaven and Earth and what they produce are things."
2. "A thing is a thing and nothing more. This is actuality."
3. "Actuality exhibits actuality. This actuality is not empty. It has
position."
4. "Taking it from its position makes it lose its position. Placing it in
its position makes it rectified."
5. "In using this (proper) rectification which is no (proper) rectifica-
tion, means, having doubts in its (proper) rectification."
6. "To rectify that which rectifies an actuality, mean the rectification
of this actuality and also the rectification of its name."
7. "Once its name is rectified, then follows, that THAT is THIS."
8. "In calling it THAT, whilst THAT does not affirm it, THAT then is THAT
and does not react to it."
9. "In calling it THIS and THIS does not affirm it, THIS is then THIS and
does not react to it."
10. "By taking IT as being in agreement, it is in disagreement. It is then
in disagreement, and will cause confusion."
11. "Therefore THAT agrees with THAT, and THAT affirming it, means it will
respond to THAT. THIS agrees with THIS, and THIS affirming it, means it
will respond to THIS. Taking anything as being in agreement makes it agree
with it. That it agrees with the agreement is the rectification of this
agreement."
12. "Therefore THAT and THAT stops at THAT, and THIS and THIS stops at
THIS - which is possible."
13. "THAT and THIS is but THAT. Moreover, THIS and THIS is THAT. In that
case THIS becomes THAT, which is impossible."
14. "A name must be identified by its actuality. Knowing that THIS is not
THIS and knowing that THIS is not in THIS then it cannot be called
(THIS). Knowing that THAT is not THAT, and knowing that THAT is not in
THAT, then it cannot be called (THAT)."
15. "How perfect were the ancient farsighted kings! They examined names
and their actualities. How careful they were in what they said! How per-
fect and farsighted were the ancient kings!"

from nothing:

comes dark matter, ghost-skein of things, all things virtual, in this and
all possible worlds, the propriety of assignment in dialectic with what is
observed as the real, the process of the proper name its _continuous_ in-
stantiation. ghosts hanging on to ghosts, we are all of the imaginary, the
symbolic nothing more than temporary stasis. look closely and see through
all of this, the names disappearing, returning to the matter of the world.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is from a little something I've been working on for a slightly other
project -- but maybe it fits best here and now in the gender swirl.--Eliz.
(warning long post)


3.) To make of its course any possible exception.

What Can She Be? A Fiction

(Mom gave us a series: _What Can She Be? A Lawyer_, etc., with savvy women
in power suits illustrating them. This is not to say that Mom's '70s-ragged
Virginia Woolf t-shirt clothing her child-adored body did not embolden me.
Hi Mom!)

I searched for the word "women" in the Poetics List Archive since January 1,
1999 and found "The Battle of the Sexes", begun by Chris Stroffolino on
February 8 with this comment:

"Dear listees:
    You know, there's certain 'commonplaces' circulating that the women
writers of 'my generation' are so much better than the male writers (the
previous moderator Joel Kuszai, I think was the last one to say this, and it
went unchallenged....so far)---
    I think I used to think this too a couple of years ago, but the best
books I've read in the last year by young writers all seem to be male for me
(NOTICE very carefully my wording--I am not saying that the MALES are the
superior sex or anything, I'm just saying that it is as ridiculous to say
the women are the
best writers of my generation as it is to say that say Ron Silliman or Bruce
Andrews is better than Carla Harryman or Rae Armantrout...)

    specifically, two 'first books'
               Anselm Berrigan's INTEGRITY & DRAMATIC LIFE
               Joshua Beckman's THINGS ARE HAPPENING
     and two 'second books'
               Peter Gizzi's ARTIFICIAL HEART
          and  Jeffrey McDaniel's THE FORGIVENESS PARADE...

     well, if anybody wants to tell me why the works by the more currently
'fashionable' gender are better, feel free
      (unless the moderator doesn't see this kind of argument as worthy of
the new list.....)
                                 sincerely, chris stroffolino"

And continued, in part, thus:

[several women weighed in with titles by women; several objected to the word
"fashionable"] [as well they might, and what does Stroffolino's post really
do but promote 8 writers, 2 of them women?]

from Jacques Debrot, February 10:

"Much more interesting than the _sex_ of the author, it seems to me, is the
linguistic _sexuality_ of the work itself -- oral, phallic, anal, labial,
etc., etc. or any of these in combination.  --That is, what types of
sexualities, surfacing as varieties of poetic speech, produce the most
interesting language?"

from Maria Damon, February 12:

"this is a wonderful formulation, jacques.  aside from considerations of
'the work itself' and aesthetic judgments thereof, which this discussion
primarily addresses, is the question of the conditions under which a text is
produced; and here i find the gender of the writer, embedded as it must be
in social contingencies, potentially extremely interesting."

And fairly quickly abandoned for class issues and the general melee many of
us know well.

I have posited elsewhere that Zora Neale Hurston and Ella Cara Deloria did
more to render the "American grain" in this century than did William Carlos
Williams (not that it's a contest -- uh). (Not that I don't like WCW!)

This "Battle of the Sexes" argument gets to several predictable points
quickly. But not everyone's central concern is either a.) what strikes me as
the prototypical aggressively defensive male stance toward any successful
woman on any terms which exactly proves -- whilst reenacting, how clever --
the complete
problem* or b.) a sexy textual analysis or even c.) the sociological impact
of being a gendered person.

*This is not the only male reaction however it is familiar.

There is a tradition stretching from Aphra Behn to Jacqueline Susann of
women who wrote to cause trouble and to make a living. (& if we agree to
broaden the meaning of "make a living" here, this statement will make more
sense in a poetics colloquium.) One could do textual and sociological
analyses of their work, but I am in many moods much more interested in the
circumstances and the
personalities _as expressed in their own times and terms_, not ours.

Oppression's subdefinition: always starting at the beginning. We need more
knowledge of history so as not always to be at the beginning, though some
would always have us so, and beginning elsewhere we will often fall on deaf,
untrained, or hostile, ears.

"Gender is a nightmare. To inhabit, to enact one gender, to embody one
gender all day and all night, everyday and every night is a nightmare."
--Jocelyn Saidenberg, "As a / As if", _Tripwire 3_


PS: Chris, Jacques and Maria are all appreciated by me.
PPS: If women don't speak / publish or get silenced, that becomes,
historically, censorship.
PPPS: I know all sorts of class and race issues are submerged here. It's
difficult stuff. (Duh you might say to this ppps/me, and I wouldn't blame you.)

Recent readings reportage.

Taylor Brady and Diane Ward at Small Press Traffic. HORRIFYING weather, and
still a quite large crowd. TB seems to have groupies. Good for him.
Interesting work. And the culverts in it matched the rain. I was very
obsessed and pleased with DW's new portraits and maps, which are coming out
in a book soon I hear.

Lisa Jarnot and Norma Cole at BlueBar. Got the books: Vulgar Tongue by NC
and Eightfold Path by LJ. Gorgeously bound up by a+bend, Jill Stengel's
project. Adored Norma's moment about "Elizabeth Carter, 1717-1806" if that
doesn't just fit into the stereotype I am making of myself here. Lisa was
very endearing as a reader, wry. I'd recommend both the chaps, though I
haven't been too articulate.

(The bartender at the BlueBar (which is a supernice place and at poetry
events I feel well-heeled enuf for it) was a nut and slow which meant I
ended up with two beers for the price of one altho secretly that still means
the price of two. Earlier Sarah Anne Cox on her way over (the spot is in
North Beach, aka the North Beach of the 50s, rather than the Mission, aka
the North Beach of the 90s) couldn't find a copy of Nightwood at City
Lights. What's with that? Yedda Morrison found ten at Barnes and Noble at
Stonestown (mall near SFState).

In North Beach you can't smoke in bars and in the Mission you can.

AHEM.)

6500 reading at Blue Books, New College. The new issue has a gorgeous cover.
SOOO nice. Two old saturated color bottles sittin there. Lots of art inside
too. 8 people read for really only 5 minutes each. Lots were funny. (Not me.
Except to myself.) Interesting mix of work. I like to see crossover. And
they had free beers for us. Everyone. Blue Books is also becoming fab. I'm
sure they have Nightwood. Plus every chapbook I've heard tell of recently.

It keeps raining.

And my next piece will be for Let's Go.

Internet Access Charges

January 1999

This is a variant of the historic modem tax hoax of bygone years. This
latest version started making its rounds on Nov 06, 1998, based apparently
on a CNN story. Early versions pointed the finger at the FCC as the villian
in this story. Then it was 'the government', then it was 'the Congress'.

FCC statement:
"... the FCC has no intention of assessing per-minute charges on
Internet traffic or of making any changes in the way consumers obtain
and pay for access to the Internet."


********************************

  Date: Wednesday, January 06, 1999 10:03 PM

  Looks like Congress has found another way to tax us.

  There is a new bill in US Congress that will be affecting all Internet
  users. You might want to read this and pass it on.  CNN
  stated that the government would in two weeks time decide to allow or
  not allow a charge to your (OUR) phone bill each time you access the
  internet.

  Please visit the following URL and fill out the necessary form!

  The address is http://www.house.gov/writerep/

  If EACH one of us, forward this message on to others in a hurry, we may
  be able to prevent this from happening! (Maybe we CAN fight the phone
  company!)

*********************************

This alert is a hoax. The earliest electronic version of it, which does not
urge any particular action but merely reports and comments on the story,
appeared on Usenet on Nov 06, 1998. Appearing under the thread "INTERNET
PER MINUTE FEES COMING?" on the ba.internet news group, it cited a CNN
story aired that same day. A later version, urging everyone to contact
Congress, appeared on Nov 18, 1998 in a different news group and referenced
an FCC release dated Oct 30, 1998 as the source of the CNN story. The
actual FCC proceeding which apparently set off this mushrooming flurry of
alerts
dealt with the 'reciprocal billing' issue, which relates to charges for
interconnectivity between various telcos.

In reaction to it, the FCC issued an official statement of December, 1998,
which can be found at
<http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Factsheets/nominute.html>. This
publication restates that the reciprocal billing issue does not include any
proposal to have metered billing of any sort by the telcos for internet
usage.

Reputable organizations producing legislative alerts will include some
basic information which will assist the reader in determining how and when
to respond. Most if not all of this information was missing from this
spurious alert.

1) Congress does not vote as a single body. Any alert should name the
specific body (House or Senate) scheduled to vote to whom letters/email
should be sent. It will also indicate whether this is in front of a
committee, and which committee, or that it is set for a floor vote.

2) At a minimum, a specific bill number will be cited such as S.1615 or
H.R.3888. The reader can then check the Congressional bill status web site
<http://thomas.loc.gov> to determine the precise current status of the bill
before writing to your member of Congress about it.

3) A specific alert date, and a deadline date for responses, will be
included to help in determining whether the alert is stale.

4) A legitimate alert will say exactly what is wrong with (or right with)
the bill, possibly even citing a specific section. Check the language of
the bill on Thomas to ensure that amendments to the bill in between the
time the alert went out and the time that you're reading it haven't changed
it to the point where the alert is no longer relevant.

It should also be noted that this alert began making its rounds after the
105th Congress had adjourned. Although the House of Representatives came
back into a lame duck (post election) session to consider the issue of
impeachment of the president, no other issues were considered. And the
Senate did not reconvene at all. The 106th Congress was officially convened
in early January, 1999. At the time the new Congress is seated at the
beginning of every odd numbered year, all bills not enacted into law by the
end of the previous Congress are swept away. The new Congress starts over
with a clean slate, introducing entirely new bills which must make their
way through the entire legislative process. A legislative alert from 1998
is null and void in January,
1999, whether it was spurious at the time or not.

Tod asks about poetics mags:  I think that Crayon, with their first issue
(the festschrift for Jackson Mac Low), and Aerial are doing important work
in publishing attractive, durable, and diverse (content / contributor wise)
issues devoted to a single author / artist.  Even if my interest in the
author "treated" in the issue is not extensive, these mags hold the
possibility of changing that for me.  At the least, they give me some sense
of the generative possibility one author / artist holds in developing their
poetics through essays, talks, poems of course, interviews, publishing and
making other opportunities for and with other artists, etc.  The work by
other writers published in tandem to the "treated" author / artist gathers
a certain something in that context & often provides a(nother) way in to
the work by the featured cover star.

Jerrold Shiroma's Duration Press chapbook series, to which I have
subscribed from the outset, is absolutely one of the most important series
I know of right now (alongside Second Story, Leroy, and Potes & Poets new
series).  The reason that "international writing" in translation is
important to me is . . . well, while writing from the belly of the beast
(USAmerica) tends toward certain conceits at any given moment, one notes
that other traditions, more or less particular to their given contexts,
mean other criteria for innovation, etc.  It's equally interesting to me to
see what English language poets are reading (translating episode one) and
how it is they are rendering the work they read from more or less outside
the contexts of the "original" works (translating episode two).  If you
believe that civic discourse includes poetry / poetics, the world market
threat to and augmentation of "culture" makes a series such as Jerrold's as
vital as can be.

I tend to subscribe to mags and chapbook series that are self-conscious in
what they do, why they do it.  Mary Burger's Second Story Books series has
a particular project, an intellectual project, behind it, not merely a
matter of publishing work that no one else would touch (which is not
necessarily the case, anyhow).  And that project is reoriented as per the
work and as it comes out.  So, there's some learning going on there.  How
can I resist chipping in?  The benefits are obvious.

dear e: thank-you for yr response. interesting my mind tells me that often
more than not most folks do the usual--read poets they know--and even tho
the poetics IS dialogue--less and less go on. Chain is amazing. Tripwire
too. I miss ACTS, TEMBLOR (which did the only great job of blending
poets--"language" next to "beat era" or whatever--) esp. How(ever) and
others. I simply want to publish AND talk abt poetics. THat doesn't happen
even with the subscribers we have. It's weird--and like show
business--still. sad.

even with my query--only a few respond.


alls,

re todd baron:

 How bout a web site? I actually get orders and letters every now and then
and actually more and more from my very lowtech one.

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?

Tripwire. Ixnay. Kenning. Poetry Project Newsletter. I think The Germ and
the Hat, actually I think 6ix too. Chain's run out after a few years. Easily
(comparatively at least) available at stores.

2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.

interesting vital work (what a boring answer huh?). women (frankly if its
more than half men i don't have the time). a decent design is nice too,
however cheaply done. actually i find it kinda essential.

re jamie perez:
>here I have a problem: "men have defined... why shd they..." I think as
>many a man feels ensnared in this "dominant" culture that has painted
>them into a set of roles and actions. I would say most men don't feel

>subset of what they "can" do and exclude a whole other range of
>experience. I suppose one could look at another small subset of
>experience and show how free-ranging women are, but has anybody
>investigated this?

but seriously, haven't men defined it? women have influenced it perhaps, and
maybe are even secretly ruling the world, right, yay. but did you know Sarah
Fielding was more respected and more popular in her lifetime than her bro
Henry? (source: Mothers of the Novel, Dale Spender) Does that count as
disappeared? Censored? On any non-dead level? It is political, you won't
change my mind there.

And like, I dunno, have we HAD any girl presidents?

I know men don't feel like god all the time, I do sometimes , etc. But that
doesn't take care of the free-range or the f**ked up ness.


I will find the thrilling quote from one of SF's novels to post here; I
passed the book on......

How bout this for a title? THE FEMALE QUIXOTE (1752) by Charlotte Lennox.
Rockin.

Yes, "English-language" jingoism seems to grow and grow and grow,

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?
2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.
3) What purpose should/does a poetics magazine have?

Hi Todd,

I'd love a copy of the Love issue of ReMap, and would be willing to trade
books, or chaps for it, if you'd like. Backchannel me & we can talk about it
more.

As for your questions, the truth is, I don't subscribe to any poetics (or
poetry) magazines, largely due to lack of funds. I usually trade. Basically,
I read Shark. Most of what I get/trade for are poetry mags or chapbooks, not
poetics mags.

To be totally honest, *most* of what I read w/respect to contemporary poetry
is online. (I have lots of time at work to do this, or at the very least, to
print things out.) And there are at least a few mags devoted solely or
partially to poetics online that I've really found valuable:

Arras: Brian Kim Stefans mag, which has a few interviews and essays.
Callaloo: Which you can't get unless you subscribe to it (I can get it
because I have a Columbia University email, and the University library
subscribes to it).
The East Village Web: Mostly poetry, but Jack Kimball is starting to publish
poetics essays as well.
How2: Probably the best online devoted to mostly poetics; it also includes
new poetry.
Jacket: John Tranter's mag has lots of interviews, essays and reviews.
Lagniappe: Graham Foust and Benjamin Friedlander's mag is mostly reviews and
includes a few broader essays and letter exchanges.
Readme: The mag I do, which is predominantly interviews, essays and reviews,
with some poetry by people contributing secondary material.

Most poetics journals -- at least the ones I've run across -- tend to be
either too conservative or too academic (which, as I'm using the term
"academic," means pretty much the same thing) for my tastes, so I don't
bother with them.

As for question #2, important or needed would mean that the magazines
include discussions of work that I'm generally interested in. Also, that
they offer something more than PR. I don't mean that they can't be
overwhelmingly positive. But, I guess there has to be, for me, some sense
that the writers are really engaged with the work they're writing about.
This may be another reason I tend to shy away from what I'd call more
"academic" poetics journals: I don't have the sense that the authors are
engaged so much in the writing under discussion as much as the various
critical frameworks they're looking at the text(s) through. Obviously,
that's arguable. We all look through various frames. But, I guess what I
mean is that I have to have the sense that whatever does come up, in the
review or overview or whatever, comes from the work examined. I realize
that, you know what? It's been kind of a long time since I've read a really
good poetics essay that wasn't involved with a specific other work, or set
of works: in other words, a kind of "general" poetics essay. It may be that
I kind of avoid manifestos; I don't know. Totalizing pronouncements, while
they may be of great value to any poet who writes them, may not be so
valuable to me, unless I'm really studying that poet's work at the time.

As for question #3, I can't speak for anyone else's purpose; just that I
guess it would have to sustain whoever's doing the magazine. For my own
magazine, the purpose is to get poets talking about their own and others'
work. Whether or not I'm interested in the poet's work, the interview, if
it's "successful," tends to deepen my familiarization with that person, or
maybe provides more of a context for their work than I had before. As I
said, I don't like totalizing propositions about What Poetry Is or What
Poetry Should Do, and tend not to respond to that; more to people describing
what feeds and/or drives them. Art history doesn't really interest me
anymore, either, so historicization of one's writing (or another's) also
tends to leave me cold.

The ideal poetics journal, for me, would be one where you've got very close
readings of various texts, and pieces that deepened my sense of the context
in which any one particular poet might be writing (their "life").

It's a drag that you haven't had much response to the magazine lately. I get
a lot of response to mine, but I think that's because the medium is
conducive to immediate response--so I do get a lot of email, probably from
people who are at the site while they're writing me. I'm embarrassed to
admit that I haven't written a through-the-mails letter in at least a year,
probably longer, and I used to do that a lot. ...

Anyway, I don't know if this adds anything, helps, or what. But I'd love to
hear what others have to say about the various poetics journals they read
.. especially if anyone knows of any great ones online I've missed (or
wants to send me copies of their in-print ones!) ...

Yours,

Gary Sullivan

From: "todd  baron" <toddbaron@earthlink.net> wonderful dialogue!

I have recently purchased NO single anthology--sadly--due to the SAME voices
being heard and entire generations lost. I read any magazine that comes my
way--and recently New American Poetry, Talisman, new mag. zazil,

too true as feeling down. not abt money either but TALK. Even this list
doesn't discuss often THE POEM--the thing itself--but rather surroundings of
the poem. More later--

send me yr address ReMaps there.

Todd,

While I may not be answering your question directly (or at all), I
have encountered many of the same problems with the duration chapbook
series. Beyond the small handful of subscribers, & the freebies I send
out, the response to the series is almost nil. Makes me wonder how
many people are actually interested in what happens beyond our
American poetic borders. In response, or in addition to your post,
perhaps I should also post the questions:

1) What anthologies / collections / etc. of poetry in translation have
you recently purchased.

2) Does the work of poets from other countries (specifically
non-English speaking countries) have any importance to your own work.

3) What purpose does, or should, the publication of works in
translation have, if any.

I don't want to sound like I am complaining, but am feeling somewhat
discouraged by the whole thing, & wonder if anyone actually cares for,
or is interested in, works in translation.

Bests,

Jerrold

1) What poetics magazines are you currently reading AND subscribing to?
Some of these are trades, I think, not really sure--
Quarter After Eight, Key Satch(el) (the mag folded but the chaps live
on), Lost and Found Times, Skanky Possum, Hanging Loose, Denver
Quarterly, Orpheus Grid, House Organ, Primary Writing, Controlled Burn,
The Prose Poem International, there's more, these the immediate I think
of, & in reaction to, right now. As Gary mentions, many fine web based
magazines as well.

2) what defines an important or "needed" poetics magazine for you.
The editors. Take the new magazine ZAZIL. When the editors Bill Marsh,
Joe Ross, Joel Kuszai & Stephen Cope, get together, I have an
expectation based on what each of them has done in the past. If you have
not seen this mag, it kicks, with a balance of new contributors (don't
have it here, but Mez? takes chances, as do the editors including her) &
familiars/ established folks.

Reading full length books and finding out where an author I appreciate
first appeared in. Then trying an issue, to see if the editor has the
stamina to continue these kind of choices. My favorite mags, have two
things in common usually:
1. New people. The editors have done their field work, found new names,
done the digging for me.
2. Are not afraid to edit contributors work, or decline solicited or
unsolicited material from names that will sell the magazine, if they
have seen better work, recently, elsewhere.

One of the best things I ever did to increase magazine circulation was
to find a company to sponsor a trade mailing of 200 copies back 4 years
ago. The issue before & after & the one sent nearly sold out from the
mailing & the word was out to pave the way for full-length books, where
we, and most small mags usually go with age.

Be well

I'd like to second Leonard Brink's remarks on the fetishization of
>perfect bound journals which
>resemble commodities/commercial products of mass reproduction.

So much for "loser wins" --the sole material advantage I can see to perfect
binding is the spine, which draws the attention of potential consumers away
from sewn or stapled chapbooks when displayed on bookstore shelves. Within
Poetry World, though, the main thing about perfect binding seems to be that
you can't do it in your home, that the actual production of the book is
cleanly alienated from the writer. God forbid that you should xerox a book
of your *own* poems --and I invite anyone who'd do something so tacky and
desperate to present their wares to Small Press Distribution and see what
they tell you... The introduction for Renee Gladman's recent Holloway
reading with Anne Carson in Berkeley was most telling in this connection
--it mentioned her chapbooks, her editorship of Clamour and LeRoy, and then
went on to announce that "her first perfect-bound book" is due out soon
from Kelsey St. Press. Like that's our guarantee of the work's excellence
and value: "a book so good they had it glued!"

This is tricky. Because 'men don't have it easy either' is still bound to
sound disingenuous when uttered by men --- and with good reason. Yet what
David says here, responding to Jill and Jamie, speaks to me, at least in
part. 'Being a feminist,' as a man, means less 'having a lot of women
friends,' in a purely social (and self-congratulatory) sense, than it means
acting locally against enculturated tendencies in a process that might be
seen as political and psychoanalytic (in the general, not the clinical
sense) at the same time. Just as merely 'having black friends' (esp. when
'being friends' means somehow 'not noticing' that they're black) does not
get you off the racism hook as (as I am) a white. (And plenty of other
thoughts last night, roaming NYC after the Diallo verdict came down from
Albany.)

Personally I think gender is more and more culture and less and less nature,
esp. in what we so tiresomely now call the cyborg and genetic eras. My own
social experience is such a confusing jumble of 'feminine' men and
'masculine' women, in addition to 'normal' types, that it's easy --- perhaps
too easy --- for me to argue against gender essentialism. (Thoughts after
reading Judy's and Elizabeth's latest thoughts on this thread.) Perhaps it's
that as an (unapologetic!) academic and native New Yorker, I've dwelled my
whole life in habitats that blind me to conditions in the 'real world.' I
haven't had a male advisor or mentor since my undergrad days, and my major
critical and writerly influences (Perloff, Hayles, Haraway, Drucker, Howe,
Retallack, Tardos) are all women. Yet this itself, what I've just said, may
be no more than that 'I've got ________ friends'; and it's funny (funny =
strange) how easy it is to flatter oneself a boy feminist while still
failing to do the real personal work.

just a con-fused think ---

I agree with the author of the above, and would add to that, that a good
deal of my energy in this lifetime has gone to attempting to dispel the
miasma of malehood they pumped into my nursery and kept on pumping until
little by little women--mostly women--pried a window up and started to
clear matters up for me (and for themselves, and why not!). It requires a
good deal of consciousness and i know i am unconscious most of the time.
But I have attempted to show the other side not only to myself but to other
men. And now I am glad that Jamie Perez also shows an _other_ side.

In this question of gender roles, we all need all the help we can extend
and receive. I welcome Jill Stengel's post and, like Jamie, find myself in
substantial agreement with what she says.

It has everything to do with poetry, which is the theory of
heartbreak--which always stems from mistaken assumptions and inability to
imagine how it looks from the other's standpoint.

no, but I've just  read  Barbara Risman's   Gender Vertigo   Yale UP 1998
which has a lot of interesting things to say about gender shifting with
circumstance -- e.g. "unwilling " single fathers in "nurturing" roles -- &
she also gives a detailed account of families attempting "fair" (I.e. equal
& sharing) marriages -- with a close up of the effect of this on gender
construction of children of these marriages

 she also has something to say about method  & I noted with some interest
(re- Bourdieu on this list recently) that "structural" sociology did not
seem to her to meet her needs.

 She looks to a possibility of a "post gendered" society.

I am not enough of a specialist to offer useful criticism or judgements of
the book.  However it seemed to me that it could be useful to the gender
discussions that find place on this list.

>but seriously, haven't men defined it?

 Elizabeth, I think what Jamie (and I) want to say is, Yes, but it wasnt _us_ .

In 1952, I was working on a farm in Sweden. The housekeeper was German. I
was English. I found out she hated me because my people had destroyed her
hometown, Dresden, so spectacularly. I hadnt even been told about Dresden
being destroyed. I was too young to fly a plane, etc. At the same time, I
wasnt so fond of Germans, because they had tried to kill me and my people
with such earnest application just a few years before. But the housekeeper
hadnt been flying one of those planes, either.

Best,
 David

Jim,
"Honest" with respect to what? - one's own practice, or ... ?  & how does
taking a good look at not knowing what one is doing apply to the selfsame
sense of "honesty?"  Is it anything like the fright one gets, noticing in
the mirror the absolute resemblance between the lines on one's face and the
military roads and bunkers dug out of the land of Kosovo?  Ignorance is easy
to recognize, but really hard to explain.

*** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ***
Date: Current through July, 2000 Place:
http://www.bigbridge.org/authors/redslider.htm   or
(<http://www.jps.net/redslider>www.jps.net/redslider)
Michael Rothenberg's Big  Bridge Press, (www.bigbridge.org) cordially
invites you to  attend the premier world-wide-web showing of Red Slider's
installation,

-------------- NOGUCHI:  THE MAN WHO ENTERED STONE  ---------------

An assemblage of twenty-eight poems and  associated photos, images and
commentary celebrating the life and work of   Isamu Noguchi and his legacy
of sculpted  space.

Mr. Slider's presentation invites both the first-time casual  viewer
and the long-time connoisseur alike to regard Noguchi's contribution  from
an entirely fresh and original vantage of poetry.  Ranging >from  neo-formalist
through haiku to avant collage, these works represent a first  installment on
Mr. Slider's claim that what history and biography can merely  describe
poetry may yet be able to embrace.

"If one would follow  Noguchi into sculpted space," says Mr. Slider, "then
they must let go of what  they know and let their imagination lead the way."
We  invite you to walk this hypertext garden, encounter the hushed museums
of  giggling biomorphs, magical journeys into the vortex of Mu, eavesdrop on
a  conversation between a dead man and a fellow exile or contemplate the
austere  silences of an art that can "place stone, so."  Whatever your
acquaintence with his work, "NOGUCHI: The Man Who  Entered Stone"
should afford an enriching new experience of America's consumate sculptor
of space.     You are also invited to provide a link  >from your website to
the presentation for your visitors. If you would like a  special banner for
this purpose, please contact us and we will be glad to send  you one.    We
look forward to your visit,
  Red Slider, poet

I thought it was just me (not knowing).

I figured my understanding of both terms had been impossibly messed up by
the fact of being a woman (object)(subjective)(subject of
speculation)(object of worship/derision)(subjective idiot savant).

Hello folks,
I just put a visual essay on my web site of Joan Retallack's _NOH S'EX_ =
which was published by Backwoods Broadsides. Its URL is =
www.99main.com/~swmarks/essays.htm

In light of the discussion between Jim Andrews and Brian Kim Stefans, =
I'd also like to point people again to my Ghostwriting Collages which =
appear at www.99main.com/~swmarks/vispo.htm on my site. Click on the =
image below Ghostwriting Collages. These collages were made from books =
that I ghostwrote for a management consulting company, combined with =
images from stock photo books. The majority of my work comes out of my =
work. Since I am very interested in how power plays out, I sometimes =
wonder if I *didn't* have jobs I either disliked or endured, whether I =
would have anything to say or show.

Lastly, for a look at current artistic, cultural and economic values, =
visit my home page.

My residency is winding down for trAce so this is a last call for you to
submit to the Lost Project - it's at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/lost/

Please do! We'll keep it open a few more days.

Also - the ragged appearance of the page is deliberate. You can still
submit of course - use the tab key to change fields if you want.

You can only submit once per address - that's built-in.

Some of the entries are really haunting/beautiful - look at

Brian,

Thanks for bringing this issue up of gender essentialism.  I too have
felt uncomfortable here with the use of "gender," which seems to mean
the plain old male/female dichotomy that we might see, for instance
in a Sandra Dee movie.

In the experimental poetry world, particularly here in San Francisco,
it seems to me that there is a rigid definition of gender roles.
Women with power being powerful *ladies.*  If one is not a lady one
must either make oneself exotic at parties or be considered a bit
freakish.  And, yes, there are race and class issues involved in all
of this--sorry to mention that hoary thing again.

I'm not denying that the world is rampant with sexism, and I'll be
the first to admit that there are a lot of asshole guys on this list
and in the poetry world and beyond--but I think that the formula of
men = oppressors, women = oppressed is simplistic.  This is coming
from the perspective of someone whose writing project is to present a
radical female perspective but who has received encouragement/career
help from men--much more so than women.  Any theoretical writing that
has influenced my writing has been female/feminist, but the women I
find who are interested in discussing these sorts of writings are
female academics--not poets.

I've seen plenty of women censoring other women, and if I'm to be
ruthlessly honest, I've done it myself.  People are pissy and
judgmental and have their own little agendas.  Welcome to the world.

Dodie

I think this thread is very useful, in part because it is just informing
me of new journals I want to look at and in part because it is bringing up
the very relevant and vital issue of how to keep poetics mags surviving.
I think that doing it online is, yes, probably very helpful and cheaper
and more accessible, but I'm a sucker for a hold-in-your-hand object,
especially if it is beautiful (good design -- beautiful in any sense).  I
therefore love Chain, the Germ (but when is it going to come out again?!),
Rhizome, AL&C, Talisman, others.

On a related note, has anyone else read the Scharf columns in Poets &
Writers?  I am really still pretty new to this whole world myself, so
maybe other people found the articles (which pretty much delinate the
state of experimental poetics, sticking it into two groups, the New Coast
group and the Elliptical group) rather lax or misguided or whatever, but
for myself, I was very encouraged to see this stuff laid out so clearly
and so pro-experiment in something like P&W, and with so much room given
to names I don't usually see in there.  I was kind of thrilled that h te
columns exist, but would love to hear other opinions.

I'd also like to hear who is going to be at NEMLA in Buffalo, at poetry of
the 60s in Maine, at BoPo this summer.  I hardly know any of you by face,
and would love to meet up with fellow listers.  Backchannel, certainly, if
you like.

Thanks,
Arielle

SOME THINGS YOUR CURATORS THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

Last reading:

Lee Ann Brown sang a capella mountain songs. She also sent a family
storming out during the reading of a very explicit sexy poem.

Daniel Abd al-Hayy Moore performed Millenial Prognostications. He played
two auto-harps, some xylophones, drums, and other wooden instruments. He
had some half-dozen books and tapes for sale.

Both poets rocked the house and challenged the expectations of many who are
used to seeing a head speak from behind a podium.

Other News: Frank Sherlock came to up to the St. Mark's Poetry Project with
a posse. I've seen so much beer and black leather at the Poetry Project.
  He reminded the New York scene that Phila is a tough town and has some
serious poets.  He pulled the mic off the stand and stepped away from the
podium to deliver some heavy verse, alot of it from memory. And I quote
second-hand, Lisa Lubasch, "Frank, he's tough. I like that."

Jena Osman gave a great introduction to Robert Creeley's reading at the
Temple Gallery on Thursday. She poses a serious challenge to Kyle and I.
Creeley was superb, especially when he spoke extemporaneoulsy about poetry
careers.

I was there and it would be wrong to say I did not know what to do. I was
floating in the crowd that bore me without ever knowing what it was doing.
"I'm left with the fact that I know many more humna beings than I require
to continue living among them, and there will always be between them and me
this useless knowledge." all at once we feel comforted. we must remeind
poeple more often that they are people. someone will always sell you for
thirty pieces of silver, when suddenly in the crowd you meet a human
glance.

he begins to write the day war is declared. all the while appearing to
resemble, it nonetheless does not resemble.

-- you might find Barbara Risman's book I mentioned yesterday -- Gender
Vertigo Yale, 1998 -- useful.  she also refers to writing by Sandra L. Bem
on gender categories -- of which Bem in 1995 theorizes at least 18 --
instead of 2. ( In her bibliography Risman notes:

 Sandra L.Bem  The Lenses of Gender: transforming the debate on sexual
inequality. Yale  1993.

& in Journal of Sex Research 32:4 , 1995 Bem: "Dismantling gender
polarization & compulsory heterosexuality: should we turn the volume up or
down"?

(I havent read these)

Risman comments p.160, after listing 18 possibilities of gender, & clearly
wanting to extend the possibilities :

"My view of gender as infinitely more plastic and complex than a
three-category variable makes Bem's proposition overwhelming.  How would the
math work(gender x sex x sexual identity) when we realize that there are
dozens of femininities and masculinities in our culture? For how gender gets
done varies dramatically by class, ethnicity, race, region, and age. Still,
the notion of exploding categories and allowing much more creativity in
self-presentation feels more like liberation than does the deemphasizing of
gender than we now pleasure ourselves by doing".

(Is that last sentence an echo of M.Foucault?)

Todd, Hey I forgot to plug my subscriptions to Raddle Moon and The Germ,
mags which I hereby plug. I don't know how much reply I got to Outlet's
interview with Kathleen Fraser or Marcella Durand's history of women
publishers around the PoProj, yet somehow just having put them out there
makes me happy. I assume someone somewhere is reading them.....the issue
sold out at least.

Sometimes we don't know what we're doing or why. Sometimes we find out. Who would

An analysis of the economy of 'cultural capital' or 'prestige' might make its
workings more explicit rather than circulating via, what, the 'subterfuges' that it
normally circulates in?

I haven't read all of the correspondence involving this term on the list. But what
I did read by Jacques Debrot I found interesting and am sorry to see that it isn't
happening any more, though I understand there was a big blow up about it.

Not sure what your objections have been to discussing this topic, if that's how it
has been.

Raising the subject itself needn't imply an attack on poets and poetry. I didn't
really get the impression that's what Jacques Debrot was doing.

How is 'cultural capital' different from 'prestige'. There have been several
replies to my simple question, but none that attempted to answer it.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

A set of nine linked prose poems in which an elegant and sinuous syntax
embraces an extraordinary range of reference while maintaining a
deceptively smooth narrative flow.

" Yes, the human organism is such a marvel of clockwork that desire risks
whirlpools and shallows. In the mirror, her words palpitated, and amniotic
fluid became an incurable want. Albinos have been regarded with
superstitious awe; white steeds, much admired. Fear of masturbation took
him as far into Africa as the Niger.

Thought is so little incompatible with organized matter that it seems
rather one of its properties, on a par with geometry. The apple she ate was
satin green, sharp, sweet. By contrast albinism is white and never opened.
Her soul sat in her brain, substituting inner for space. If only Ibn Batuta
had known the value of experiment in addition to observation, he would have
cupped his hands, as around a breast."

Faint Optimism  Keith Waldrop   20 pp, 10x15 cm, £2.00 / $3.00, ISBN 1 903090


A set of fifteen linked poems, written in a spare and minimalist style. The
degree of formal invention achieved with this reduced palette is striking.

Nelson's pillar, one of Dublin's best loved monuments, was blown up by the
I.R.A. in 1966. This poem explores the rich layers of associations that
accumulated on it.

" Woolworths was a box of light.  On the bright side
looking out you could see the streaked street,
plate glass doors like a fresco, Jackson
Pollock maybe on a dark day or better still
the tubes of paint themselves, melting.
On the inside Hopper but all pastels.
Or the Gobi Desert.  There was no shade.
Fluorescence had the say-so; boy how it swam
across the insulated ceilings from the steaming
entrance to the back of the store where you got
your picture taken with no front teeth.  How it lit
with one blast the whole shebang; it
was horizontal and vertical, spilled
like a sheet down and in and out and on
the downy heads of the assistants
with their warm crests of hair. Or the hoity
toity girls at make-up, maxfactored
or revloned, their perfect fingers tapping,
one mascaraed eye on the clock, or on the mirror
where it tilted on the counter-top,
reflecting glass and chrome glass and chrome
all the way back to where I stood
in my mittens in my knitted bobble-cap
the two pounds ten for presents
in the póca of mo chóta my toggle coat


Untitled Sequence       Peter Riley     16 pp, 14x21 cm, £3.50 / $5.00, ISBN 1 903090
16 4

A sequence of 10 poems, first published in 1977 in Peter Robinson's Perfect
Bound. A narrative concerning a touring production of Macbeth by a college
dramatic society is the pretext for a series of wonderful flights of
philosophy, wit and lyricism.

"Wind seeps through cracks in the park
and woos the inner female. Fanned
into a state of glowing consolation
the chemical maiden opens her arms.
Can this be right? Such assiduity
for so long produced nothing worth
scrapping over and then when I'd
turned aside given up & officially retired
the whole place came crashing at my
feet again devoid of snares.

I sink into the armchair and critically regard
the stained fountains in the Hotel Lounge:
they are delightful, so are the potted plants.

Sometimes I like myself very much
and think I'd make a first-rate detective.
Except for the bits that involve courage.
and expertise. and enthusiasm for the whole thing.

Tonight we'll make love
in a novel by Joyce Cary
where it can't but be good."

WANG PING was born in Shanghai, China, and graduated from Beijing
University in 1984.  She moved to the US the following year and earned her
doctorate from New York University.  Affiliated with The Poetry Project at
St. Marks Church in New York, Ms. Wang is a poet, fiction writer, and
translator.  Coffee House Press (Minneapolis) published her three books:
American Visa (stories, 1994), Foreign Devil (a novel, 1996), and Of Flesh
& Spirit (poetry, 1998).  Most recently she edited an anthology of
contemporary Chinese poets that features the generation of younger poets
who have emerged in the past twenty years, during a period of tumultuous
change in China.  New Generation: Poems from China Today  (1999, Hanging
Loose Press, New York) also presents a remarkable collaboration in
translation between Ms. Wang and a host of prominent American poets
(including Ron Padgett, David Shapiro, Richard Sieburth, Murat Nemet-Nejat,
Anne Waldman, Lyn Hejinian, Keith Waldrop, and others).  Wang Ping has
recently moved from New York to St. Paul, Minnesota, where she teaches at
Macalester College.  Her historical-critical work on Chinese footbinding is
forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press.

Hello all,

I'm quite new to the list, so won't be jumping into any discussions at
the moment.  However, I wanted to let you know what's going on in my
small universe.  I'm a student at Tufts University and have been putting
together an Intercollegiate Literary Society (ILS) this year.  So far
we've got seven schools intimately involved and at least four others
looking to jump into the fray.  I'll happily describe this endeavor in
more detail to anyone and eveyone interested.  If you are associated
with any university, I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter
and to involve your school.  In the meantime, ILS in its present state
is holding its first event:

Live Anthology

Thursday, March 2nd
7:30 PM

Adams House (lower common room)
Plympton Street
Harvard Square
Cambridge, MA

Representative readers from
BC, BU, Brandeis, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, and Tufts
will be reading.
There will be
an open-mic session
and refreshments.

Please contact me any time for more information on ILS in general or
specifically the Live Anthology:
Jamie Crawford

It is true that anthologies sometimes tend to publish those writers
already "known", & it is possible that many important writers fall
through the cracks. At the same time, however, there are a number of
anthologies that are incredible eye-openers (I'm thinking of Wang
Ping's _New Generation_, Ammiel Alcalay's _Keys to the Garden_, two
different anthologies of Mexican poetry--poetry that is not often
enough made available to American readers--by Juvenal Acosta & Forrest
Gander--not to mention Jen Hofer's upcoming anthology, which I am
eagerly awaiting, or think of Kent Johnson's Russian anthology when it
came out...it did fill an important gap, & brought attention to a
wonderfully diverse range of writers), & in this sense, I can only
hope that the input from "other" poetries can help (as Patrick Durgin
pointed out) open up the terrain, so to speak, as to what exactly
"innovation" means, or can mean.

But perhaps the focus should be not simply on whether or not
anthologies of work in translation are read, but is work in
translation is read *at all*, & if so, why, if not, why. Given that on
this list we can come across quotes from (or references to) theorists
almost daily, why not the same attention paid to the poets, or even
the poet's poetics?

Anyway, is just a thought.

Bests,

Jerrold

I'm passing this question on from Linh Dinh who is living in Saigon these
days.

Does anybody know the answer to this question. You can back- or forward
channel the answer directly to me. I've already asked the person I know with
the largest vocabulary and he was stumped also.

Ron

-------------------

Dear Ron,

I talked to Hoang Hung, a man who's trying to translate Ginsberg's Kaddish
into Vietnamese, and he was stumped on one word. He asked me what "gream"
is? I said, How the fuck do I know? Do you know what that word means? Please
let me know if you do. I think Vietnamese readers deserve a kaddish.
                Thanks,

Jim Andrews said that noone had answered his question so I will try to do
so very simplistically:

How is cultural capital different from prestige? A well educated reader
from a background in which books are read could be said to have cultural
capital.  In other words, he or she has the cultural baggage needed to
read, say, difficult modernist poetry.  A work or author that possessed
value, according to those who possessed this cultural capital, would
accordingly have prestige. I might have cultural capital as a reader
without enjoying a high degree of prestige as a poet, for example.

""1) What anthologies / collections / etc. of poetry in translation have
you recently purchased.

2) Does the work of poets from other countries (specifically
non-English speaking countries) have any importance to your own work.

3) What purpose does, or should, the publication of works in
translation have, if any.

I don't want to sound like I am complaining, but am feeling somewhat
discouraged by the whole thing, & wonder if anyone actually cares for,
or is interested in, works in translation.""


I don't find reading poetry in translation very satisfying as a general
rule, and am troubled by the ready acceptance of shoddy translations.
Since professionally I read Spanish poetry constantly, I rarely look at
translations. Everyone always asks me why I am not a translator, and I
think that this will be my eventual path. Very little Spanish poetry after
Hernandez and Lorca has been translated, and seeing some existing versions
makes me think I could do much better. I still distrust translation as a
matter of principle though. More often than not it establishes a
sentimental relation to the original text.  In other words, I have to
assume that Rilke is a great poet in order to slog through some turgid
English version.  I attribute the defects to the translator while
extending a line of credit to Rilke. It drives me crazy because I don't
know what I'm reading after a while...  This being said, I think I have
much less "translation tolerance" than others, and my sense is that there
is a great hunger for good translations.

I think one of the problems with Jacques analysis, which he has
acknowledged, is that he was using terms from Pierre Bourdieu which are very
specific to the contexts of PB's argument, one element of which has to do
with "subjective" and "objective" analysis of cultural phenomenon.  Having
finally read the great PB, a book called The Logic of Practice, which
concerns mostly an analysis of Algerian culture, I realize the difficulty in
applying these terms, or at least the difficulty in not using the
terminology with a sensitivity to certain issues PB raises, such as that of
time.  He contrasts an "objective" analsys, which tends to render things in
a "mechanical" way -- A does A, it means B, therefore A becomes elevated to
state of A to the B power, hence a new A -- when there is really something
much more fluid and contingent involved, especially in those instances where
A deviates from the norms, hence the meaning of "B" cannot be easily
determined via some static paradigm but must, in a sense, alter the paradigm
to make way for new meanings, or irresolutions of meanings that flatten out
elsewhere.  (This "paradigm" is, in Bourdieu's terms, the "habitus," in
another's the episteme, there are several variations with their specific
meanings.)  Anyway, this is an oversimplification, but his example Jackson
Mac Low and awards, reception, etc., seemed to lay out a too flat background
on which JM's activities were enacted, not recognizing the deviations in the
activity, the unpredictable elements, the alternate outcomes, etc. -- which,
again, I think Jacques acknowledged.  So the question of how "cultural
capital" and "prestige" differ would be a different question based on how
much you tie the former term into Bourdieu -- in layman's terms, they are
probably very synonymous, but "cultural capital" -- as in, say, the case of
Jean Genet -- could confilict with any notion of "prestige" that we know of,
and yet, in a realm in which deviations from the norms of cultural engagment
possesses positive value (as in artistic circles with fairly recognizable
standards, as much as they conflict with the "mainstream," say in Cocteau's
circle), the terms may very well become synonymous again, though not as
static or ossified.  A Genet could operate with some confidence that his
works were entering into the field of literature not entirely unnoticed, not
entirely without precidents, and yet also work with the knowledge that he
was deviating quite strongly from the norms, though in meaningful ways
(perhaps his syntax gave him some confidence along these lines, hence
freeing him up to investigate other darknesses).  Not everyone pulls this
off, of course -- the rather antique looking modernism of, say, Williams
circle, as Jacques pointed out, looks rather silly or strange to us today,
yet at the time we can believe that these writers thought some sort of axis
of deviation and acceptance was operating, hence the "self-interest" which
he, Jacques, writes of is present even in the "vanguard" which, we generally
believe (as in Van Gogh) had not faith in the system -- there was probably
more of this faith than we realize.

Subject:      gender essentially tacky
Mime-Version: 1.0

Dear David B, I wasn't blaming _you_ (yall). Just trying to put fingers on
things, which as ever requires a certain dumbing-down of one's experience,
as I, like Brian, and I'm sure many others here, live in a social context
that is, well, for another cliche,
diverse(/confusing/thrilling/irritating/!-home), and always have. Still,
essentials have their place in trying to understand the world, if not in
writing POETRY, at least, for me, in writing POSTS to POETIX. And I would
argue still that this list is a bit of a male bastion, tho I have a separate
set of complaints about the women's poetry list. What do I do about it?
Speak up and get in trouble if necessary; sound like a careless brat, which,
some days I am.

Who said pubbing one's own work was tacky? Well, I have done so. So. So did
a lot of people we now respect. Like Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf (not
that I'm them, duh); like what went on with James Joyce and Sylvia Beach?
(not that I;m them). That relation verges on, well, tacky to me. Anyhow, I
did it once, and I just did it again as the Milk Bees in Dlb's Lucille
series (PLUG). Did it for fun (cliche essentialism agin ohno! toto) and for
my new niece. (I'm sure some are barfing at this sentimental gesture.) But
don't worry I also have written some other things other people have printed;
don't worry I also publish other people in much vaster numbers than I do
myself. Am I tacky or paranoid? Self-serving? OH WELL.

The work 'll stand or fall, as ever.

I liked what Gary said about what sustains one as a pubber/editor -- and I
love seeking out new writers, doing that research. (Todd, Please send me the
Remap! I've been waiting for months!)

Back to David B, Charles Bukowski has a similar story in his novel Post
Office, where he actually confronts the person blaming him (black postal
colleague) and says his folks were in Germany during US slave times. (But
then isn't he still getting the benefits , such as they are, of being white,
right then and there?) (I am white -- or at least have the "benefit"
(experience?) of looking so -- in case this has not been obvious in my
obsession with gender to the obliquing of race -- tho I say that more as --
well, it's too confusing to ramble into -- I'm a mix (and who cares here but
me))

But even those on the margins will have their prejudices, and why not, we're
all human. I'm just grateful not to have been flogged for admitting I only
read mags with a chunk of women authors. (Or maybe no one reads my posts.)

And I love Bukowski for his prejudices, not despite them, tho I wouldn't
have dated the guy (nor he me no doubt). For another completely obvious comment.

XXX -- fearing all I've said --
Eliz.

...when i say "i love him for his prejudices" i am thinking in particular of
a very harsh rendering of women speaking in one of his proses. it's funny
and real to me and takes me into a tangent of experience not my
own,--essentialised / cliched perhaps as the other. Charles Bukowski is my
muse! (JOKE)
I'm thinking of renaming my computer's "shortcut to email"   "highway to

Excuse me while I duck into the phone booth and slip on my corporate
wetsuit, but this poet just happens recently to have taken an editing
job at a digital publisher who's currently in the process of soliciting
work from poets. The deal is this: you convert your stuff (for instance,
a collection of unpublished or previously
published-by-a-press-who-is-willing-to-let-you-reproduce-them poems, or
digital archives of the online journal that you edit) into Adobe PDF
format. You upload the title to the web site, set your price, and
provide author info. and summary info. for the document (this can
include images and sample poems). People can then pay via credit card to
download your stuff and print it out. You get fifty percent of the
profits, and the company (Fatbrain.com) gets fifty percent.

Right now there's not much literary content on the site (they're a
technical bookseller), but Fatbrain wants to revamp it and is going
after poets, some of whom are expressing interest. At the end of the
month / beginning of next, they're planning to launch a big advertising
blitz surrounding the site, and they want to push National Poetry Month
as part of this.

Even though I work for them, I actually think Fatbrain's providing an
interesting opportunity, which is part of the reason I'm willing to post
this and take the risk of getting my real life entangled with my day-job
life. The other part? If I can get poets like you people to publish on
it, then my day job will become that much more interesting ...

If you're interested, or know someone who may be interested, please
contact me backchannel at my work address (katied@fatbrain.com) or, if
you want to keep the conversation more informal, at my earthlink account
(degentesh@earthlink.net). Thanks!
