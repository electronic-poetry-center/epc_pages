as a non-poet, with opinions about poetry (what i want to know is how good
a poet you have to be to have opinions about poems or poems about
opinions) here is my reading list of the moment

che - a life of che guevara (everybody needs a little revolution)
james tate - distance from loved ones (i know the subject says non-poetry,
but . . .)
operation shylock - philip roth (because sometimes you have to read to
someone whose voice starts at their heels)
ursula k. leguin - klatsland
origins reconsidered - richard leakey

Just finished reading Spider Robinson's _Lifehouse_, the usual Spider
stuff, but a very intricate plot involving three very different couples,
and best of all set in Vancouver.

Am half way thru Timothy Findley's most recent book of stories, _Dust to
Dust_, stories about people getting old and closer to death, half Gay half
not. Everyone drinks a lot of wine and smokes a lot of cigarettes.

Also reading Carl Hiaasen's _Double Whammy_ to my wife Angela in the
hospital. She is a Hiaasen fam. I am getting a little enjoyment from it.

You're right: I looked at the cover this morning and, *blush* it was "James
Fenimore Cooper" staring out at me. Ah well. Just one of those email days.
Prior to this, in another email, I'd managed to subtract a minute off of
Cage's (John or Ben?) 3'33". Maybe there's a name for this malaise. It only

        "Better a witty fool than a foolish wit."


1).     Having punched my screen before completely reading Bernstein's message
        Saturday, I am now writing this without the aid of a functioning
        monitor, and am in effect blind above my keyboard Stevie Wonder.

2).     I have received two very pointy backchannels from Charles Bernstein
        informing me to clarify my position or else, also informing me
        I am to write no more than "a few" posts a week.  CB's been
        nice enough to share with me his opinion that I am not thinking
        clearly (what's Haldol?) and really I ought for everyone's sake
        clarify my position regarding slapstick in poetry.
        Hence this post. Clarify clarify.

        I will try to write as clearly as he does.

3).     Roman Jakobson had it that "poetics deals primarily with the question,
        _what_ makes a verbal message a work of art?"

4).     In my case, I'm interested in how slapstick, humor, antic mood, and
        yes insults make "a verbal message a work of art," ie a poem.

        Poetry and slapstick figured interestingly in much modernist work,
        and slapstick is still an important if not prominent element of much
        contemporary poetry. Poetry and insults go way back. (Many of you
        know, for instance, there is a long tradition in Irish poetry of the
        insulting poem.)

        But what makes a great insult?  What makes an insult funny?  How
        does it lighten rather than darken the mood of the "verbal message" --
        that is, the poem (or sometimes the post)?

        What, furthermore, is the social role of insult, of humor, of the
        antic taboo-defying impulse? how does it Work, where does it Fail,
        and how, ultimately, does poetry include these elements?

        Let me demonstrate. [One caveat please: I have NOTHING against any
        of the people in number 5: I read their criticism avidly and
        admiringly].  Now to demonstrate:

5).     If I were to write that

        **Listening to Perloff, Vogler, and Bernstein
        discuss poetics is like listening to a boil, a blister, and a tumor
        discuss the importance of the body,**

        I would be breaking taboos of politeness and hence I would never write
        that -- even as a demonstrative quote to illustrate a point.  But if I
        WERE to write this, would it not be funny, and would it not add to a
        poem's (or a post's) mood?  -- ie, would it be comedic or even
        poetically comic art?  Of course it would.  But why?

6).     Furthermore, is it possible to use verbal slapstick without
        making an effigy, without, that is, socially injuring a
        particular person and without hurting someone's feelings?  For
        instance, I have recently in the spirit of good fun "insulted" Mark
        DuCharme [Nov 6, "My Discoball of Wrath"] and Eliza McGrand [Nov 13,
        "Re: Free reading..."] (and hope to get around to Henry Gould
        soon), and of the two of them Mark DuCharme, I think, took it
        personally: I have NO hard feelings about this or toward him at
        all (antic antic).  I am in fact a pacifist and rather mousey.

        So the question becomes: how do we avoid effigies?

7).     First, the insult and the humor must be "over the top," it must
        be VERY wonked.  Why?: Two reasons: It is important that the
        person attacked first be turned into a caricature, lest he/she be
        mistaken for an effigy; but it is also important that the person
        attacking first turn himself into a caricature, lest the insult,
        after all is said and done, be thought to be truly meant and
        later held against one.

8).     Thus, MP is an elitist critic yadayada: NOT!
        Thus, CB is a controlling prig: NOT!
        Thus, MD is a sycophantic wuss: NOT!

9).     The challenge of slapstick poetry (or in some cases posts) is not to
        make effigies, as I have just done with Perloff, DuCharme, and
        Bernstein.  Such utterances are boorish and hence not slapstick.
        (So please don't hit me on #8: I was trying to illustrate a point.)

10).    This is one beauty of slapstick: it provides the delight of sin
        without its presence. Quite a trick. It is one of the great
        kathartic inventions of performative art.

11).    SO, what, if anything, can anyone out there tell me about slapstick
        poetics, insultive poetry/letters, bibs (Byron, Pope, etc), etc.
        Must I write another book!

12).    George Thompson: how heavily does insult, mockery, slapstickery play
        in the old Indo-European poetics?  I can read ancient Pali, but
        as you would suspect there is very little insulting done in the
        Dhammapada. The closest portrayal of insult in the Pali is a
        nameless king hires a beggar to throw goat dung in the mouth of
        the king's overly talkative priest (CB's ears pricking here).

13).    Henry Gould: what about contemporary Russian poetry? much
        insulting htere?  I am aware of Victor Raskin's journal about
        humor, but could anyone point me to particular articles either in
        this journal or elsewhere.

14).    In case any of you are wondering who the heck I am and if in fact
        I'm an actual boor or if I'm just pretending not to be, here's a
        statement of "my" sentiment:

15).    These inspired cliches: to insist along with Patrick Kavanagh that we
        aren't alone in our
        loneliness; to second Bill Knott's opinion that a portrait of Marcheta
        Casati would look beautiful even if hung improbably and inappropriately
        upon a man's forehead; to write upon my own forehead, as Tully wished
        citizens might, what I think of the republic;  to insist that we are all
        bookmarks in a holy anthology; that though each of us is a nobody,
        we are together consequential; that those among us of greater
        consequence never forget the ache in their forearms; that all anger is
        unjust;  that Jesus and Lenny Bruce spoke the same language; that Janis
        Joplin could out-sing Maria Callas and Buster Keaton out-talk
        Christopher Lyden; that buffo, not rage, that inanity, not
        reason, are the only viable means of wresting dignity from the hands of
        bureaucrats and professionals; that the ready ease with which an
        academic will assume someone to be stupid is more repugnant than a
        barfight; that yodelling at a plate of eggs can satisfy one's
        curiosity for a better life; that underdogs can be jerks too; and
        finally to concur loudly, like a car horn with lips, with Henry
        James when he said that three things in human life are important: being
        kind, being kind, and being kind.

16).    It is the thought of Tully's that gets me: to write upon my own
        forehead what I think of the republic:

17).    Prose is when you write in sentences. Poetry is when you write on
        your own forehead.  Slapstick poetry is when you write on your own
        forehead and then head-butt someone.

18).    SO, HENRY GOULD, to end with reference to a question you posed the
        list last week: it is precisely BECAUSE so many of us have such an
        anemic political and public life that it is imperative our
        Poetics List and our poetries
        not be devoid of humor and good-natured insults, that our aggression be
        sublimated in humor and for the sake of humor, and that utterances
        pertinently nonsensical and pointlessly adamant not be banished from
        discussion.

PS, I HOPE TO BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE RANKS OF THE OTHER CHILDREN SOON, IN
TERMS OF THE FREQUENCY OF MY POSTING, NOW THAT I HAVE EXPLAINED MYSELF.

Currently still recovering from a recent saturday in a library at which,
for (pseudo)scholarly purposes, I read all three of Robert Lowell's 1973
sonnet volumes, _{Avoiding}History_, {A Big Fuck You}For Lizzie and
Harriet_, and {Flogging}The Dolphin_. Still, recent read/am reading
Eugenia Semyonovna's Ginzburg's _Journey Into the Whirlwind_ (a memoir of
her years in Stalin's camps), a novel: The Burn by Vasily Askyanov
(finished it thanksgiving morning and found out that afternoon he is E.
Ginburg's son), Jung's _Synchronicity_ (well not really but I should have
been all things considered), Hugo Ball's _Flight out of Time: A Dada
Diary_, and Larry River's _What Have I Done_ (from which, I'm convinced,
David Lehman cliffed his entire chapter on the New York painters in his
The Last Avant Garde), and I'm w/in striking distance of finishing
_English,August_ by Indian novelist Upamanyu Chatterjee.
        On deck for the holiday break: Fever Pitch, by Nick Hornby (about
his life and times as a soccer fan) and whatever I find in a various
public libraries to which I have access.

"And I remember somebody leaning up against the dirt wall of the
hillside, deriding William Carlos Williams, when suddenly there was a loud
roaring, crunching noise and a chunk of the hill fell off and covered the
person up to his neck. The person, being a young classical poet fresh from
NYU, begun screaming that he was being buried alive.  Fortunately, the
landslide stopped and we dug him out and dusted him off. That was the last
time he said anything against William Carlos Williams. The next day he
began reading _Journey to Love_ rather feverishly."

Above the world-weary horizons=20
New obstacles for exchange arise=20
Or unfold, O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.

There are presently almost 700 subscribers, though all of these subscribers=
 do
not necessarily receive messages at any given time.

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list=
 should
not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep=
 the
list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep
the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, in order to maintain openness, is moderated.

We remain committed to promoting the editorial function of this project in=
 all
ways available to us. The definition of that project, while provisional, and
while open to continual redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless
aversive to a generalized discussion of poetry or other topics. Rather, our
aim
is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are
committed
to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content,=
 to
the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

While individual posts of participants are generally sent directly to all
subscribers, we reserve the right to review posts before distribution.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications and reading
series
that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear (see
section 9 below). Such announcements constitute a core function of this=
 list.

Please keep in mind that all posts become part of an on-line archive.=
 *Posting
to Poetics is a form of publication, not personal communication.*=
 Participants
are asked to exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity of
response may seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has the
darker side of circulating ideas that have not been well considered (or
considered by another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature of the
medium, subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when reading the=
 list
and, where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be something close to a
spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as if it were a revised or
edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!").

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange=
 in
this still-new medium. We request that those participating in this forum=
 keep
in mind the specialized and focussed nature of this project.=20

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.=20
For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.

___________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge, but formal registration is
required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your real name, street
address, and phone number. All posts to the list must provide real name, as
registered. All subscription-related information and correspondence remains
confidential.

You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line=
 message,
with no subject line, to:

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Phill Phillway

(replacing Phill Phillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to
unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow several
days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.

*

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the=
 Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you may be
able to substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may=
 get
bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us. If
the
problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from your
system
administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is part of your
scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider obtaining a=
 commercial
account.

In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,=
 simply
resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account problem has
been resolved.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription=
 or
subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's administrative=
 address:
poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may take up to ten days, or
more,
for us to reply to messages.
____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other
unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.=
 Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from=
 this
list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages are
received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional messages
until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day. While it is
difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily, weekly, or=
 monthly
posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in mind. If you plan to
respond to multiple threads, it is generally preferable to consolidate your
reply into one message. Subscribers who, in the judgment of the editors,
overpost to the list will be asked to limit the number of posts they send.

While relevant excerpts from a post to which you are responding may
usefully be
appended to your reply, *please do not include in your new post the whole=
 text
of a long previously posted message*. As an outside maximum, the listserv is
set to accept no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber.
Participants who post more frequently than these parameters suggest will
receive a reminder asking them to limit the volume of their posts.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a=
 post,
since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or
who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"=
 text
or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the list appears not to be
compatible with the the list's automatic digest program and as result such
messages disrupt the format of the Digest, even though this coding is=
 readable
for some subscribers who do not use the digest option. When sending to the
list, please send only "plain text". Note, however, there is no problem with
sending clickable URLs in HTML format

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are
always welcome. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or=
 supply
information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting something you
requested, please send the request or comment to the individual backchannel,
not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted Poetics
message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to receive ONE
message each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for=
 that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply to this
message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for
any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may=
 lose
not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily turn
off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"

set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail
message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather
long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics subscribers.=
=20
This list is alphabetized by server not name.

or try:

review POETICS by name review POETICS by country

which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country
(since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)

*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a=
 specific
subscriber.*

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to=
 serve
as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in formally
innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center provides
access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new poetries
including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct=
 connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides=
 information
about contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in=
 poetry
and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets'
reading their work, as well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview
series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the links=
 to
Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year or search=
 them
for specific information. Your interface will allow you to print or download
any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications=
 as
easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a list=
 of
your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press
Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write=
 file
name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail=
 message
to the address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If your word processor will save files in Rich Text Format=
 (.rtf)
this is also highly desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover
copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check=
 the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you
have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

I for one am glad to see in Gab Gudding's post that I didn't kill off a
certain vitality by naming it. I think Gab has made his position clear.
His posts are intended to be considered as rancid fumistiere. He just
ain't no Alphonse Allais and that's why his posts are rancid. To the
degree with which your penetrating counter-post exposes inconsistencies
and paradoxes in his approach, you simultaneously address why his posts
fail. He himself exposes the vulnerability of his style by declaring his
own vulnerability e.g. as "a pacifist and somewhat mousey." Until this
assertion has been tested empirically, it has no force as satire. It's
pathetic. Personally, I think Gab is too much bluff and not enough
substance. Names can be manipulated ironically; but content even more so
with much richer results. But the requirements are more severe. He and I
have discussed this.
As for Perloff, damned if Gab et al didn't seem to be fulfilling in
their own way exactly what she was calling for in her original posts.
She just couldn't handle the heat. And substance wouldn't matter here.
It, more than likely, would just have been ignored.
No one on this list could be blamed for interpreting General Bernstein's
actions as the establishment not being able to take the heat when in
this case it was the establishment that called for the heat and is fond
of criticising, however politely, those other establishments for things
such as censorship. Bernstein has used that very word. Has he not?
Unlike some people on this list, I can say whatever I like precisely
because I have nothing at stake except my own sense of integrity and I
can take that on down the road.
Folks like me develop good ears. Perhaps you should not allow us on the
list in the first place because, from my experience mastery of a subject
or set of ideas has little to do with 'belonging.' Given these
circumstances, to my mind, Gab's responses were legitimate, appropriate
if not quite artistic triumphs and should be addressed as you did, in
the open but on a level playing field.---Carlo Parcelli

Some of "A Cry" by Sara Teasdale, Some of Other Words


Oh, there are eyes that she can see,
   And hands to make her hands rejoice,
But to my lover I must be
      Only a voice.

Oh, there are breasts to bear her head,
   And lips whereon her lips can lie,
But I must be till I am dead
      Only a cry.

Oh, there are words that she can hear,
   And words that she returns to me,
But I must be for lock and weir
      Only a key.

Only a key, a voice, at night,
For my life goes locked across the wires,
And I have neither sound nor sight
And he is there, and there are pyres

Burning brilliantly my bones,
And there are fires out of sight,
And I will die on these dark stones,
My words are lost against his light.

And she shall never hear from me,
Through bridge and router, eternally.

Crane's The Bridge fails as done Pound's Canto's and Duncan's
Groundwork. But there are failures and then there are failures e.g.
Williams' Paterson where the good doctor is decidedly out of his depth,
so to speak. Gab's failure is however of a different order of all those
above. But I don't care. In my book, he should be given every
opportunity to fail/succeed/engage/disengage.
And then there is success, which doesn't imply superiority to failure.
But when huge artistic ambition and success, call it completion perhaps,
conflate---Oh, Joyce! Oh, Wake!---Carlo Parcelli
By the Bo-. Did you folks know that our managing editor of FlashPoint,
Jack Foley, wrote a book length unpublished study of Crane? Since
there's so much interest in Crane, maybe I can convince him to publish
it (or at least a piece of it) in an upcoming issue.

What are "folks" like Carlo like?  How did they get to be so much better
than ordinary mortals, and to have such a sense of integrity?

It must be great to have all that impressive mastery.

Perhaps, far from not allowing 'em on the List, we should hand it over to
them!  from the above passage it would appear that they're the only ones
with sufficient "mastery" to run things!!

There is an interview with Rae Armantrout up on the Teachers & Writers
Collaborative "WriteNet" web site.  Since the page is devoted to issues
specific to teaching poetry to students in grades K-12, Rae talks about
ways one can teach the prose poem, and suggests methods for introducing
avant-garde work to students (and teachers) that are not fraught with
anxiety. Poems Rae talks about include "The Mix Up" and "Wake Up," both
from her book _Necromance_.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Chicago Review is hosting a poetry reading by
Peter Dale Scott
Monday December 7 at 4:30 pm
Classics 10
1010 E. 59th St. on the University of Chicago campus.

The reading will be followed by a reception.

Scott has recently completed a remarkable trilogy--Coming to Jakarta,
Listening to the Candle, and Minding the Darkness--which mixes politics and
autobiography, beginning with the 1965 slaughter of more than a half
million Indionesians. His brilliant use of collage in the composition of a
long poem is clearly in the tradition of Pound, if to very different ends.
James Laughlin has said of the first volume in the trilogy: "Not since
Robert Duncan's Groundwork and before that William Carlos Williams'
Paterson has New Directions published a long poem as important as Coming to
Jakarta."

The most recent issue of Chicago Review (44:3 & 4) features a special
section on Scott's poem.

If anyone needs directions, more information, etc. feel free to e-mail me.

GABE TO ME, backchannel

Dear Joe, I'm afraid that I can't respond frontchannel for a few days but
I'd like to reply now so i do so privately.  First, thanks, as always, for
your gentle replies.

I'm well aware, to my chagrin,t hat much of my humor falls short and that
i'm in many eyes nothing more than a boor, and I am also aware that many
think i'm just being "performative," (showing off).  But that is far from
the case: i'm interested, as i've always been, in finding the new, the
disturbing, and the unappreciated in poetry, and my interests have long
lay in humor.  My posts DO have an inquiring purpose: I am indeed mocking
myself constantly in my posts: the whole ridiculous posture is MEANT to
be self-parody, which, I see you feel, falls short: okay, it falls short:
I intend NO slight whatsoever to CB or MP or MD: people expect me to and
that's precisely why I wrote #8.

Sometimes,yes, I know my posts "fail," sometimes, though, they do not: I
have it on good faith that my posts are welcome by many on the list.
More below.

when i'm tlaking of effigies there I'm thinking aloud, making a query of
the list, trying to elicit addenda or embellishments to these first ideas
I've had about all this:  look I took CB at his word, to clarify, and I'm

think here,to do so openly, WHILE attempting (and, I see, often  failing)
to embody what I'm writing about.

the whole point is that the pretentiousness is meant to be so darn
ridiculous that it's laughable -- in a way that the garden-variety
pretension of hte list isnt.  I do mean to mock myself first of any.

but then, right along with your remarks on the history

None of it's meant to be a ploy: that's who I am, thank you very much.

That acrimony is in MANY MANY of the comments of people on this list to
begin with: it's just directed outward at "them."  I'm directing it inward
at us, via schlocky and often raunchy bad humor. Look, my affiliations are
with experimental poetics and poets, with decency in general: when I say
I love and admire and read Perloff, Bernstein and Vogel avidly, I MEAN
IT!: I DO.  I have stated clearly what I don't like about Perloff's work
and I have stated clearly, with a tiny history to back it up, why I think
it's important she not center much of her criticism around the terms
IMportant, Bad Good, Lasting etc.

but that's neither here nor there, no sense rehashing same stuff

> all, this list is not *simply* a performative domain... mself, i feel on

I, as I just mentioned, give Many reasons, thumbnail sketches of whole
critical milieus, quotes, reasoned argument -- many many many more, in
most cases, than those who simply pipe up with Poo-poos -- AND, yes, I
also "goof off" -- but I never goof off without a point.  I disagree with
you there: never without a point (except for the insults to MD and
McGrand, but those too I was writing with prose poems in mind: i'm trying
recently to work in slapstick elements into my own work,a nd much of that
ducharme post has worked its way into a poem of mine "Tippetycanoe
Delendum Est," about going postal.

> some occasions that you're just goofing off, but on others it seems to me
> you're using the semblance of same as a mask to get in some real digs... &

I intend in those moments to caricature myself by "going over the top,'
indeed if I in fact use negative energy to place that in the reader's
mind I also pull it out and call myself a boor, and if that fails, as
you say it does, I'll work on it, I hear you.

 i think you think i'm some kind of vicious putz: i'm not in the least: i
MEAN IT when I say that insult fascinates me: i'm a young guy with a tiny
baby daughter a wife a step-child and am in love with life, poetry, and
being good: am also, however, fascinated by slapstick.  i think i said
elsewhere that i don't have a mean bone or ligament in my body: my only
problem, joe, and i htink you've pointed this out, is that i think i'm
damn funny.  good lord.  pray for me, joe.

i will write that book: seeif you can't help me with it than!!

with every warm and kind wish, gabe

------------------

ME TO GABE, backchannel

gabe, thanx for your kind post...

no---sweet post, really...

now it seems to me---but i can't be sure, b/c it's only me---that if you
were to have posted to poetix *anything* like what you've just posted me bc
(please don't ask me to explain), nobody would take offense, and not a few
folks would think much more highly of you, as i do now... perhaps this is
b/c i'm not nearly, mself, as forgiving or as generous as i imply in my
various urgings... hell, i'm a LOT less likable in person, if i do say so,
have long enjoyed the benefit of email filtering out my more talky,
aggressive qualities...

if you like, append this post of mine to your bc post to me, and post the
result to poetix as a "dialogue" twixt the two of us... this should help
relieve the stress/strain factor on poetix of late, and perhaps do everyone
a bit o good...

on the other hand, i'll understand entirely if you choose not to... in any case

peace, best---

joe

        (This is dave baptiste chirot)--
        (Apologies for the length--)
        (Please note, if you are interested in the BLACKBIRD anthology
mentioned below, which is visual poetry, essays, poetry, reviews and
Holocaust memoirs from artists and poets around the world--all based on
one four line poem by Paul Celan--feel free ro ask for more information .
. . . )
        I've been away from this list for several days now.  My two
younger children were ill and then out of the blue the Ukrainian
visualpoet Rafael Livshin and his wife Lilia stopped by for a visit, to
exchange news
of friends, to share works in various media and exchange addresses of
places to send the works to in countries around the globe.
        This time away from the list (and I often am, not having email at
home) gave me time to reflect on what I had written regarding Dr. Perloff
and the issues she raised.
        In the first place, I'm appalled at the post I sent--there are a
few interesting points, good ones hopefully, but they are buried beneath a
refuse heap of mean sp[irited, ignorant invective--a kind of grand guignol
caricature of hooliganism, ignorance and mob noise--there's no clarity, no
reason, no sense of exchnage as in an open discusssion--
        I'm not writing to apologize or to defend myself and those words.
This isn't self criticism in the truly grand manner of the Stalinist
Purges nor the Maoist Cultural Revolution.  I've seen and heard and
studied about enough of these--and they are always present with us--to
have no taste at all for such.  Self examination however does seem
worthwhile, if one is to have any self respect and to be of use through
one's life and work in the community of peoples..
That being the case--how did such an appalling bit of malarkey
emerge?  It might be easy to attribute it to the unconscious, a sudden
flowing forth of carefully concealed invective and venom, beneath the
"cultivated" surface.
        No, on reflection I realized that I had fallen for the bait, "seen
red" as they say, and like the bull to the cape had charged full force
forward . ..
        The reason I was so angered by Dr. Perloff's post was three simple
words:  Intolerance, multiculturism, discrimination.  I undersdtand Dr.
Perloff's points re close reading and (I hope) a literary and critical
sense of discrimination (which is sometimes allied to the concept and
practice of taste as the work of Bourdieu has demonstrated), I understand
these and many of the High Modernist and Formalist issues of critique that
Dr. Perloff is invoking.  The problem for me, and what made me see red at
the time (don't worry, I calmed down . . . ) is that by throwing in the
word and issue of multiculturalism (implicity perhaps as a lowering of
standards, in the face of which a more rigorous critique is needed)--this
linking of the three words made me deeply uneasy.  It's very disturbing
and
needs a far more reasoned and thought out approach than that which I
employed in the heat of the moment.  (I recall ruefully Tom Mandel's
comments re wanting to punch Ed Dorn--and Tom's amnger at Adorno--the
difference is Tom expressed himself well . . . was not only passioante
but thinking . . . )
        I'll try to explain as brtiefly as I can my seeing red--to give it
a context and to explain my own being appalled at what I wrote within that
context, which context includes Dr. Perloff and this list but as well many
many other things--
        First--at the end of my post I did make one point which is worth
thinking about:  intolerance/tolerance not as either/or but as both/and.
        As a mixed race person I encounter this both/and every day of my
life--and in dreams and works as well. One is the living presence of one's
ancestors' warring with and loving each other.  In an odd way just to look
into the mirror or see which way you are accepted one way or another--it's
an interesting living out of Heraclitus' assertion that strife is the
source of what is created, over and over again--an ancient yet living
companion to Foucault's posing of power as productive and not solely
destructive  at the end of the
first section of Discipline and Punish.
        So--this idea of intolerance versus tolerance, to me, is far more
complex.  And it is an important issue to think on as more and more people
living in the USA--the future, really, to be through all these
children--are mixed race.
        This mixing causes as is well known a good deal of "mixing" up so
to speak in the canon--and I understood a good deal of Dr. Perloff's post
to really be concerned with this issue, hence her argument for a High
Modernist intolerance versus the muddied and at times mushy  waters of the
pc contingent--however, Perloff included
multiculturism. This is a not an
uncommon argument.  (The lowering of standards . . . the need for
rigorous readings . . . )I understand the reasons for all this--until
they come
to intolerance being extended to includes forms of discrimination (in it's
doubled sense).  One can't but feel the hair rise on the back of oone's
neck . . .
        As to this issue of the canon--intolerance and discrimation at
times is a kind of "revolutionary" act--an act of purification
(whether a form of militant Puritanism or a Purge is always the danger . .
. ) I  think the arguement is to
forward the cause of the poets Perloff steadfastedly has for quite some
time.  Bob Grumman had at one time called Language centered works
"aco-dominant"--and many on this list disagreed.  I do as well--I think
that the writing Perloff is attempting to advocate is what Raymond
Williams would call "emergent"  (or Bob might want to call
"aco-emergo--dominant")--that is, work which is not yet dominant in the
academy, but is steadily working its way toward being so. In this case,
Dr. Perloff's intolerance of certain works and types of work, constitutes
a very real and very powerful (in the sense that what she says and thinks
and writes have had and do have immense consequences in the academic
world--and by extension, to what is known and studied by students around
the usa, and to what is considered worthy of being published, anthologized
and the like . . .)--constitutes a very real and powerful force, a force
whose effects are extensive, yet radiate from one center, and one alone.

        So--my two main points, buried in the rubbish heap of cheap
vitiriol and disturbing (above all to oneself) attitude --are the issues
of intolerance and its extension into and being allied with the canon.
        As to the context of my seeing red--I thought that over a good
deal.  There is a context for it, not an excuse nor an apology, but a
context, which by my  post I contradicted--and that is what does appall
and
disgust me--not that I acted towards others as I did, but that that the
action countermanded much long and hard work of my own.
        In the last months I have been involved with various mail art and
visual poetry exhibitions, demonstrations and activities--now the
catalogues and various other related materials are arriving, bringing with
them new invites and so on.
        One of the packages which arrived about ten days ago was the first
printing of BLACKBIRD, edited by David Stone and available from Phoenix
Press in Berkeley.  (The first pressing of which I have a contributor's
copy, is in black and white, the second printing will be in color.  For
those interested, I will supply the addresss, etc)--
        BLACKBIRD iis an anthology of visual poetry, poetry and
Holocaust memoirs
and essays and reviews based on a poem of four lines by Paul Celan.  The
idea of the anthologfy is to demonstrate the ungoing presence of poetry
despite those who asserted (as did Adorno, though he's not mentioned) that
poetry could not be written after the Holocaust. Artists and poets from
around the world contributed--there is an extensivce amount of visual
poetry--here showing that visual poetry plays an integral part in the
poetic continuance of the voices and images of the Holocaust--that there
is no end . . .
        As well, by dedicating the anthology not soley to "THE Holocaust"
alone
but to a poet and the Holocaust, this demonstartes the value of poetry in
its historical and human rights opposition to intolerance.
        At the same as BLACKBIRD arrived, I was finishing works for an
exhibition for Human Rights in Argentina, had sent statements to accompany
works in an exhibition Against Racisme in Vienna and received catalogues
of the Chiapas Exhibit organized by Clemente Padin and recieved more news
regarding the events in the aftermath of the February exhibit in Santiago,
CHILE called STOP  (the theme of the exhibit;
FREEDOM--DIVERSITY--PLURALISM IN THE TEACHING OF ART)
--the show resulted in the firing of the head of the art department and
curator of the museum, Dr. Humberto Nilo, not only one of the foremost
academics and critics in Chile but as well a great visual poet.  Many
others involved with the show were thrown out of their jobs and many of
the Chilean artists now are in dangers from the government--and to make
matters worse there is the issue of Pinochet . ..  Now new petitions are
ebeing distriubuted, new works asked for to fight this, to support Dr.
Nilo
. . .
        So--these are all activities allying poetry nd the public
sphere, in an international setting . . . the consequnces for these
actions can at times be very dangerous--not only intolerance of them, but
discrimation against them--
        In this context I was in the midst of reading Mort a credit by
Celine (Death on the Installment Plan)--Celine is one of my favorite
writers.  Yet reading his work, lurking there, is as well the knowledge of
his anti-semiticism, his alliance with the nazis . .
        I was trying to resolve some of this in relation to my own works
against all that Celine stood for in the realm of politics and race--and
my own being mixed race . . .
        So, to see Dr. Perloff's post, instead of continuing with
thinking, I just exploded.
        I would note that I am very familiar with Dr. Perloff's works, not
only five of her books but many of her essays as well--those in Sulfar,
APR, at the EPC and elsewhere.  Being a bibliography nut, I have made much
use of Dr. Perloff's valuabale bibliographies, what ever I disagreed with
in a text of hers.
        For my own part, I spent five years being a film, book and music
reviewer, regular and freelance, for many papers in Boston.  I have been
in academia-taught five years altogether, etc and have degrees to tack on
after my name when I hang out my shingle . . .
        I've written critical essays that have been and are to be
published--two of them papers given at academic conferences--
        This to say, I understand the complexities and issues from not a
poet vs. critic stand point--again, I'm both--
        A long time ago, around 1911 or so, Marinetti attempted to put
forward a critical system of weights and measures.  One could say in its
own way it was a precursor to Bill James' Sabremetrical ananlyses and
abstracts regarding baseball statistics.  (A friend of mine and I once
thought of trying to apply this to poetry, as a kind of Rube Goldberg
experiment . . . )
        In the end, what disturbs me is not only this issue of
intolernace, of the canon, of racism, of discrimation, of the academy, of
poets and non -poets--but the most truly frightening thing of all--that
after working so hard and much against all such, one fell immediately
into the trap, took up the bait and ran headlong into the burning fire,
burning oneself, with indignation and all--yet completley unaware that one
was not attacking well armed or with a plan, but filled onself with the
bile one was abhorred by . . .

     The burning question, then . . .

A few suggestions for listafarians:  posts should be at least as well
written as prose; to use no solecism, typo, or misspelling that is not
necessary to the presentation; to read what you are responding to; to come
to the point in the first five pages of a post; to accuse noone of racism
or crimes against humanity gratuitously; to compose in the sequence of a
musical phrase, not in the sequence of the metronome...

This was posted on the news wire for those interested:

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Margaret Walker Alexander, who wrote poignantly in
poems and the novel ``Jubilee'' about life as a black woman in the Deep South,
has died. She was 83.

Ms. Alexander died Monday after battling breast cancer for months.

Her 1942 poem ``For My People'' won the Yale Award for young poets. She wrote:
``Let a new earth rise, Let another world be born, Let a bloody peace be
written in the sky, Let a second generation full of courage issue forth, Let a
people loving freedom come to growth.''

``Jubilee,'' published in 1966, told the story of the daughter of a slave and
a white plantation owner. The New York Times Book Review said it ``chronicled
the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of bondage.''

``Margaret Walker Alexander was a woman for all seasons,'' said Clarence
Hunter, a Tougaloo College archivist. ``She was a poet, a novelist, a teacher,
a mentor, a scholar, a humanitarian, an activist, a fighter for rights of
people. She was everything you can expect of a great woman.''

Ms. Alexander was born in Birmingham, Ala., on July 27, 1915, the daughter of
a college professor. She moved at age 10 to New Orleans and left the South for
college. She graduated from Northwestern University in 1935 and received
master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Iowa.

In 1949 she became a professor at Jackson State University, where she founded
the Institute for the Study of the History, Life and Culture of Black People
in 1968. She served as its director 11 years, and the center was later renamed
in her honor.

``I don't know anybody who has captured the heart and soul of black people any
more than she did,'' said Alferdteen Harrison, director of the institute.

In all, she spent the past five decades in teaching and writing in
Mississippi.

``She could have been in New York and been a big, big name,'' said Wanda
Macon, a professor of English at Jackson State University. ``She stayed
connected to the soil, stayed connected to the voices she heard and the voices
she wrote about. That was just as important to her as the fame.''

Ms. Alexander sued author Alex Haley in 1988, alleging his book ``Roots''
infringed on her copyright for ``Jubilee.'' The case was thrown out of court.

Ms. Alexander, who was a widow, died in Chicago, where she was visiting one of
her four children.

hello, it's wendy kramer. i work as a librarian in the branches of the
new york public library, and thot i'd post titles ordered by the branch
libraries that might be of interest to listmembers.
        as someone who used to have access to a university library but has it
no longer, i've become more adamant in my advocacy for poem-holdings and
related materials in public libraries.
        i'd like to make the standard disclaimer that my posts do not reflect
the interests, policies, opinions, etc. of the new york public library--
i post as an off-hours listmember and as myself, so to speak. or, i
speak as a public library user who works in a public library system, a
_large_ public library system--there are at least 87 branches to the new
york public library (and i've lost count since), in the boroughs of
manhattan, the bronx, and staten island. there are also 4 research
libraries (some differences between "research" and "branches" being
purpose, types, scope, depth, & focus  of collections & whether items
can be checked out (no for research libraries, yes for circulating items
in the branches).  i restrict my posts to the branch libraries.
        i think these postings might be useful for a number of reasons. First,
many people on this list live in the area, and as i've remarked in a
former post, the more the public library materials get used and
requested, the more likely such materials will be ordered. But besides
the local interest, there is the broader issue of availability that
these postings advocate. there was a thread a few weeks ago about
archiving small press and avant-garde poems. and someone posted
something about not just the occasional sun& moon press book being
represented. in the branch libraries, i'm happy to get that sun & moon,
and dream of a public _circulating_ library for chapbooks, visual
poetry, artists books, and other hard-to-buy-at-barnes-and-noble
materials. (this morning on the way to the subway b&n had a huge banner
in the window that said if barnes & noble doesn't have the books you
read, nobody does--- cringe hiss & boo! is that a threat!?)  meanwhile,
there's quite a bit of material coming into the branches. sun & moon's
come up for order regularly, as does other small press material, and spd
as a distributor shows up on book order lists. (also, i noticed that spd
started a sort of outreach to librarians newsletter and program). so,
all this to say, books are out there for the borrowing. and for those of
us without much cash, it's a way to read stuff we wouldn't otherwise
manage to see.
        a final note, if you're a new york public library user: you can reserve
circulating books from any branch and have them sent to any branch, at
no charge. however, brooklyn and queens each have separate library
systems and are not part of new york public library, so you can't
reserve a book belonging to a staten island branch and have it sent to,
say, flushing. you can have up to 15 reserves at a time.

        hope i haven't left out anything crucial  or said anything grievously
incorrect--anyone with additions or questions, please post.
        so,  tonight's posted title is:

Penelope Rosemont. _Surrealist Women_ published by University of Texas

this title a tip from nancy burr--suggested it in backchannel, & a
couple weeks later i noticed it on an order list. now it's in the
catalog! thanks, burr!

gotta go collage--- so, for now
wendy

OK i'm a geezer, i drank too much w/oppenheimer, smoked too much w/olson,
being old fashioned i believe  that poetry requires  nurturing
irreverence/questioning authority. The corollary of Pound's notion that
everyone deserves to have their ideas considered one at a time, is that if
somebody has a great idea once doesn't mean their next idea isn't
ridiculous, witness pound. so everyone, even the buddha, may be, should be,
will be challenged. The challenge should be anticipated in the emotional
budget, appreciated as a negative praise(you're important enough to be
challenged in the first place,
you're worth the effort) and maybe, if you're old enough or important
enough or published enough you'll actually be stirred by the opposition to
outdo yourself
to disprove the rude upstart's ridiculous assertions. Duncan used to say if
you haven't published a new masterpiece for six months in San Francisco
they come around banging on your door hollaring Robert, you're all washed
up, you phony phruitcake, you couldn't write your way out of a lemon
meringue pie. Is that Joanne Kyger knocking? Or George Stanley? So all this
to say I think Gabriel Gudding should be unleashed, i don't expect i'll
ever agree with everything he has to say, but i appreciate his risk, and
when i double click on his message among my morning 35 i'm prepared to be
astonished,  i suspect he's young, and nervous to be playing in the same
pen with the demi-gods, and trying to do the same thing that Bromige and
Johnson and McGrand do so well, parrying and exasperating the opponent, but
being less sure(or experienced) he's gotta go one better and actually tweek
the nose or pinch the cheek. It may be excessive but excess and poetry are
like a hoarse and carriage. Wieners screaming at Creeley in the bars of
buffalo, cackling at Al Poulin's reading. Corso heckling Ginsberg in
Vancouver. Opera is one of the necessary correctives for a language
polluted by journalists superlatives, politician's pieties, and
psychophants hipocrisy.

_Speed Tribes: days and nights with japan's next generation_
        Karl Taro Greenfeld
very entertaining-from money drinkers to porn actors to foreign hostesses
and back.

_City of Life_
        Witold Rybczynski
fun to read, though i'd recommend _Looking Around_ before this one.


_The Poet_
        Yi Mun-yol
fictionalized biography of my poet ancestor, Kim Sakkat, who now,
dubiously, has a traditional korean alcoholic beverage named after him.
I've only found a handful of his poems translated into english, but have
found several copies of this book secondhand (boo hoo).

_Hi-Fidelity_
        Nick Hornsby
recently finished this one-sure to be a hit movie starring the
candy-bar-eating-security-guard guy from "The Full Monty"

Thanks for the tip--I love books like this! There was an amazing article on
Ernest Henry Shackleton's Antarctic shipwreck in a recent national Geographic.
And lots of books on the disastrous Everest expedition of a few years
back--John Krakauer's _Into Thin Air_ and Anatoli Boukreev's _The Climb_ being
fascinating accounts (and rather remarkably *different* accounts) of the same
events. I love these stories of extreme experiences, and I love Kafka, but
I've never thought to think of them together---- But I love these horrifying
stories that take place in frozen environments, and my favorite Kafka story is
"A Country Doctor"--hmmm, maybe not a coincident...

I believe it's in _Four Saints in Three Acts_, her play which was set to
music by Virgil Thompson.  I'm not sure where in that text it appears,
nor do I know in which of her collections the complete text appears.
It's _not_ in _The Yale Gertrude Stein_.  An excerpt from it appears in
_Selected Writings_ edited by Carl Van Vechten.

Hello listies

I have been collecting information about PAUL AUSTER for a paper about his
work esp his poetry.  I obviously have the books and translations which he
has written, but I would be grateful to make contact with anyone who knows
him, knew him or has any information which may be of use. (I have tried to
contact him direct but I think I have an old address). I am still in the
collation phase at the moment and am looking for a direction from which to
approach the subject.

His early struggles strike me as poignant, and the story of the manuscript
of "The Chronicles of the Guayaki Indians.  All very interesting esp in the
light of his piece "Why Write?"  from  "The Art of Hunger".

Thanks

written?

www.litpress.com lately?  They seem to have fallen behind, which is
reasonable considering the amount of material they likely must sift
through each week.  At any rate, I'm posting my query to the list so as to
alert you all to their service, a valuable one I think.  Are they still up
and running?

1. Bookend : anatomies of a virtual self. Joe Amato.  **Well, this has to
be called "sort of non-poetry;" out of control and a wild ride.  i'll post
something on it when i feel able to cope.  But *should not* be missed.

2. Many thousands gone : the first two centuries of slavery in North
America. Ira Berlin.  **Strong emphasis on the ways African Americans
fought within slave-society for areas of autonomy, as well as for
complete freedom.

3. Early downhome blues : a musical and cultural analysis. Jeff Todd
Titon.  **There are two books that should be read to begin to learn about
blues (by which i mean the country blues, the real stuff):  the first is
David Evans' Big Road Blues.  This (which i've just discovered) is the
only study that comes close to Evans'.  And the 1994 2nd edition comes
with a fabulous 19-track CD.

4. Mapping the West European left.  ed. Perry Anderson.  **A bit dated but
solid.

5. Tula : the Toltec capital of ancient Mexico (Diehl) and Chalcatzingo :
excavations on the Olmec frontier (Grove).  **i'm a mesoamerica nut (i
think Olson got me started in that direction when i was about 15, but i
seem to have repressed this, and only recently recalled that that was how
it happened..) These are a little dry if you don't share my obsession but
accessible, and cool for anyone who likes archeology.

6. Seven faces : Brazilian poetry since modernism.  Charles Perrone.  I
think *everyone* should read this!! It's a great discussion of "my other
country's" poetic development from 1930 to the present.  Perrone is very
sharp and political and always makes the right call in juding the
importance and success of different poets and movements (which is to say,
i always agree with him).  Style is a sort of dryly idiosyncratic
post-Derrida academicspeak, influenced rather a lot by Portuguese and
French theoretical prose.  But substance-wise this is super.

prosily,

that was a great post by dave chirot...

let me offer a few more thoughts, and i apologize once again for any hint
of self-righteousness:

if anyone should think it impossible to destroy a list "community" forever
and ever, think again... it's happened, i've seen it happen, and it ain't a
pretty sight (and this has been said around here before)... this is a
region of our own doing, as tentative and perishable as anything else
human...

so while i'm all for letting folks do what they do, so to say, i'm also for
some working sense of self-restraint (modulations as implied in what
follows)...

charles b. is trying to use what tools the establishment has given him in
order to help make this place livable for 700+ subscribers---no easy
task... which is to say, he has a certain responsibility as list moderator
to *everyone* on the list---much as we have a responsibility to one another
[he sez]... after all, this *is* a moderated list, whatever one thinks of
same---and there are reasons why it's moderated (which we can discuss at
length)... but those of you who have served (even as) listowners, like me,
will no doubt be able to address the difficulties of keeping such a list
going in productive directions w/o the potentially damaging fall-out of
nastier exchange... (((and yes, i'm using what amounts to media-ecology
language here, and i think it appropriate)))...

and to reiterate:  it's simply not the case that everyone --more
specifically, every so identified grouping -- feels equally "at home"
hereabouts, for all sortsa reasons (i might mention gender as an operating
construct, but wish to avoid another jihad)... and it's simply not a matter
of "if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen" (this should be
self-evident)... so the way i see it, folks should be attentive to the list
environs as such, whatever their intentions or motivations, and stop to
consider whether they really wish merely to alienate, or insult, or offend,
or silence, or drive away (all as opposed, say, to raising anxieties)... i
don't say we should in any sense aim to please -- and i understand only too
well the necessary risks that come of pushing those envelopes -- but i *do*
say that, however outlandish or unorthodox our sentiments, we should find a
way to respond to what's coming *back to us* via the list, and not continue
as though "no harm could possibly be done"... assuming we value a diverse
list population, we can prove our commitment to same only through our
actions---which around here = words...

finally:  i regard this medium we're all busy exploiting as still quite
new, despite how tried & true it often seems... it allows for more
performative posts, near-synchronous exchange, fairly deliberate
exposition, quick procedural communique, tones of moral indignation [mea
culpa], on and on and on... over time i suspect we'll all learn better how
to tickle these keys, to offer up our wildest dreams in ways that won't
give offense (thoug of course we'll no doubt give offense too, being only
human)... but folks, we often don't know one another all that well---e.g.,
despite the incredible rhetorical skills that so many of you possess, you
can't really see/hear me winking at you right *now*, saying in so many
words "but you don't need me to tell you this, right?"...

-----

and if all of this sounds impossible, well that's something worth aiming
for i think...

Hi all-

  Apparently, I said at least one silly thing in my interview with Teachers
and Writers Collab (www.writenet.org). Apparently, though I can't bring myself
to check, I claimed that Ron Silliman once read aloud from his work on a bus.
Of course, I should have said that he  and 26 other people read from Tjanting
in various public sites, including (I think) a Bart station. I knew that, but
I find that almost anything can pop out of one's (my) mouth during a taped
conversation. Pretty alarming. I only looked at the site myself long enough to
determine that I was having a very bad hair day.
    Sorry Ron.

Sorry Joe, I was just rolling up my sleeves to reply at more length to
your post when I was overcome by irresistible ennui, decided to leave it
till later, and pushed the wrong button by mistake: another factor of
exhaustion, I'm afraid.  So I didn't intend to dismiss your whole post
with one aside.  I suppose what I was shaping up to say was that I like
the short, the sharp, the funny.  I find much of the posting here
exclusive: I think it was David Bromige who posted Thanksgiving greetings
to nine or ten of his list-mates, exclusively male.  Maybe the way
discourse unfolds, and between whom, and in response to whom, is less
noticeable than gg's jigging around.  If one has to be reasonable all the
time, posts get very opaque and tedious.  As far as moderation is
concerned, I'm somewhat at a loss.  Since I moved to New York state, I
have noticed a desperate belief in rules and control: maybe it's just a
bad run of luck.  But are the ravening hordes of Poetics folk, all 700 of
them, champing at the bit and in need of regular settling down lest they
turn into crazed beasts? They seem pretty quiet to me; even gg confesses
to being mousey.  Anyway, I'm glad when posts are open enough to let me
squeak in: vivas for those who have "failed"!

mairead, yes, i'm being 'overweeningly earnest,' i think you're right... i
apologize for that too, but am willing to venture same to help settle
things down.. i really don't know WHAT the lurkers on this list are
thinking---but i'll say again that i've found that flames of the sort
experienced here of late CAN in effect shut a list down, simply by
silencing and/or chasing away otherwise interested parties...

anyway, that said, and to pick up on two other items:  (1) i'm anything but
mousy, and (2) re new yorkers and rules:  i hail from syracuse mself so

i know you mean well, and so forth.  but do you know what i am reminded of?
more than once, i've gotten a badly spelled, cliched, boring, banal, self-
contradictory (in a stupid way, i.e. "she pursed her cherry red lips with
pain/ and yearned after his tender kiss again/ and then her pale face and
lips withdrew/ to the lonely aching sorrow she did so knew") poem, have
sent back crits that were fairly blunt and pointed out tired images,
contradictions (i.e. pale lips and cherry lips, so which is it?), made
suggestion that poet write POETS words, not borrow others.  and gotten
back some silly, spiteful bit of junk complaining because i don't use
uppercase letters in the email and there was a typo.

listen, all day, all bloody day and weekend and many a night i sit about
picking and picking and particularizing -- my words, other people's words,
picking and picking fo r typos, slurring of logic/intent/word meaning,
and i am simply sick and tired of it.  there has to be a place in my life,
writing, where i do not have to be so painfully painstakingly careful but
can be relaxed.  now, i claim email for this.  i'm not the only one -- one
of the charms of email, and net, has been the "quick" nature, and the funny
typos.  it is also one of the dangers, witness painful nature of "flames."
none of this is particularly original -- there is lots of lit. on subject
of email/net writing.

i would rather pay attention to the content of posts, ideas, analysis,
than waste my time picking and spitting over typos, demanding things be
polished and pretty and spare.  we all do enough of that elsewhere.  so
no, i don't have a problem with misspells, typos, etc. unless they are
in a citation and cause me to spend more time finding something, or unless
the typo/misspell distorts one's words.  i would take time to de-typo a
quote, that seems only fair.  but i will not stop being comfortable and
quick on posts when i feel like it and i for one would not want anyone
else to.

i don't mean to compare you, by the way, to the Awful Writer.  but what
i do want to bring to earth is that Awful Writer writes me back rude silly
responses completely discounting pretty good crit on writing because i am
not rolling on my back salivating, i.e. giving AW the response they want.
and rather than consider my content, he/she picks on my form.  it is sad,
a little funny, a lot pathetic, and a terible waste of time, theirs and
mine.

you request that psots be perfectly spelled, etc.  and i do not doubt that
part of that arises from a finely tuned "reading" ear.  but there is fun
in cacophany.  and i think you are wasting your time in form at the expense
of content, and even, missing an integral aspect of this email "form" --
its spontaneity.

huzzah for the quick, huzzah for the spontaneous.

proofs -- i "tolerate" those as well!  am catholic in my tastes! (which is,
by the by, a very odd turn of phrase.  it means open to many things, but
one would think a person "catholic" in their tastes would be exceedingly
jesuitical and particular.  i know the religeuses in charge of my early

<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>Figuring the Word: Essays on Books,
Writing and Visual Poetics collects diverse writings by Johanna Drucker
previously published in literary and scholarly journals. Topics
include: "The Word Made Flesh," "Writing as Artifact," "Visual
Poetics," "Artists' Books Past and Future," "The Future of Writing," &
"Personal Writing." The book also includes an anecdotal checklist of
Drucker's artists' books and an informative introduction by poet
Charles Bernstein.


"Figuring the Word is a work of poetics rather than criticism or theory
in that these essays are the products of doing as much as thinking, of
printing as much as writing, of designing as much as researching, of
typography as much as composition, of autobiography as much as theory.
The mark of the practitioner-critic is everywhere present in these
pieces=8AFiguring the Word is a wide-ranging collection of Drucker's
essays from the early-80's to the present. Written in a variety of
styles and presented in a variety of formats, the book reflects many
divergent aspects of her work and thinking, while at the same time
demonstrating how cohesive her project has been. Drucker begins with a
wonderfully digressive discussion of her work as a book artist in which
she gives an account of what lead her not only to her book art, but
also to her related scholarly investigations. She then provides a
series of close readings of the work of a number of contemporary
language artists, providing in other essays overviews of  the
historical precedents for this work. The book includes not only a
perceptive essay about the use of language in the landscape but also a
prescient essay about the use of language in the new electronic
frontier of cyberspace."

Gray Professor of Poetry and Poetics at SUNY-Buffalo.

By 'everybody,' I meant women as well as men, and you, Mairead, for your
pithy posts, especially. That I had named 7 men (not 9 or 10, though a line
always seems longer when you're waiting to hear your name called) before my
general greeting, was down to it being a 'men's group energy morning' for
yours truly. When the vibes are turned towards the female, the balance will
be restored. What goes around, comes around. As my ex-wife, who had already
quit, said when she looked in my car ashtray and saw all the Vantage butts
on my side, and all the True Menthol 100 butts my girlfriend smoked on the
other, "Kharma." I havent the faintest idea why she said that then. Because
the car was a Kharman-Ghia? Anyway, be that as it may, I feel discomfort at
the beam Political Rectitude turned my way by Mairead's post. Is this how
it has to be, equal gender time in all of one's posts?  Gee, it's like when
the kids were real young, and you had to be extra-careful when handing out
candy in case there were tears before bedtime. Has anyone done a count to
see which males and females of us frequent posters respond more often to
male than female posts, or vice versa?  And then there is the problem of
cross-dressers, like George Bowering. Or Rachel Loden.
Or...................David.

Once read Ted Berrigan's _Train Ride_ going from Kingston RI (not quite
Providence) to Boston. . .
        And last March read most of Johnson's ARK on a weather-delayed
Amtrak surrounded by whispering Amish and passing Ohio/Pennsylvania

i HAVE done a count.  in fact.  ehr hum.... here is MY count, by ME, that is
my very OWN count...

male posters, featuring explicitly male anatomy, have been banned in fifteen
states along with assault rifles.  9 out of 10 doctors assure us there
is a corollary, which could require an emergency bypass.  that is why
the male posters do not speak from their mouths.

ten out of nine posts are by women over the age.  they did not consent to
this posting, and all acts that are non consensual are deplorable and
should be banned.

if ron silliman tries to read on a bus, he should be banned, unless he
has a poster featuring explicit anatomy (exquisite, male, or female)
in which case he should be banned twice and his assault rifle should be
taken aaway.  nor is smoking allowed.

rachel loden and rachel lewinsky both are to be allowed to post, but
must wear their explicitly female outfits before posting.  this could
include (but is not limited to) the domestic, the maternal, or anything
drip dry with pleats.

if george bowering appears in pleats everyone must turn in their assault
rifles and then bowering should be made to sit down.  he may post female
posters but not post female posts.  bully for george, huzzah.  huzzah.

david bromige always wears white suits, ice cream suits, rather like
colonel sanders.  if he exists (bromige OR sanders, there is controversy
regarding both).  numerous people have sighted him, in white suits.  so
he can post either as a male or as a female, just not after memorial day.

gaga, well, we'll draw a vail over poor gaga except to say that he and
kent, well, it wasn't pretty, that's all, it just wasn't pretty and
neither of them is female, or a poster, no matter what they might
claim.  and i think they should give bowering back his raincoat -- the
longer they wait, the more money bowering will borrow from the rest of
us on the strength of it ("hey, got a dollar, i need a raincoat...")

  "they called to the streets, and the streets killed them". Weber, on Rosa
Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht.

Its not just a vertigo of modernity, I think, to be undone by this built
environment. Yes, Yes, it is postmodern bricolage. Architecture. But what I'm
confronted with is the concrete mixer. Dump truck. And those ubiquitous
stanchions or tapered dividers that they put out at the construction sites, road
repair, infrastructure development. Or more, scaffolding. Pinned up against the
building. Rising up. Or those cranes they must deploy at the construction site,
for the high-rise or sky-scraper. Signs everywhere. "Sidewalk Closed/Please
Cross Street." "Bus No Longer Stops Here." "Board Bus On Mt. Pleasant Street".


What did Schumpter call capitalism? "Creative destruction"? I don't know. Just
destruction. He was wrong. But, but the building seems to go on and on and on.
Cities become ugly in there inhumanity. Or even ugly in their humanism. And the
fragility of 700+ (sic) is no more than the fragility of walking across,
through, various engineered behemoths, believing they will hold our weight, with
moderators, and moderation, Believing, That,  engineering and maybe even physics
are on our side.

1.  I noticed in some post or another a reference to Charles Bernstein
as the "gray professor of poetry" at SUNY Buffalo.  Say it ain't so!  I
do not recall Charles as gray in any sense.

2.  Non-non poetry reading:

DARK -- Hoa Hyugen -- I strongly recommend this book.

CLINCH -- selected poems of Michael Scholnick, just published by Coffee
House.  Wonderful works, some echoes of Reznikoff, Denby and Hart
Crane.  I strongly recommend this as well.

ROOTS AND BRANCHES -- my favorite Duncan, often to which I permitted to
return, etc.

LIFE & DEATH, Robt. Creeley

MYSTERIES OF SMALL HOUSES, A Notley

WORKS & DAYS, Bill Luoma

all recommended, actually.


3.  So what about translation.  American into other languages, that is.
My Russian vocabulary is probably already adequate to translate some
Stein into Russian, but would it sound like Stein in Russian?  How to
translate Ashbery into another language -- other than French, of course.
(I prefer "you" in the plural. -- how do you do that without our unique
second person?)  Go for texture?  Would reproducing the sensory surface
have the same effect in Swedish or Japanese?  What about Clark Coolidge
or Bob Grenier?  If you were translating WCWilliams into a rhyme-rich
language, would you go out of your way to avoid rhymes or what?  I
recall that one among we listniks has translated THE PISAN CANTOS into
Chinese, what a wonderful idea, I need to read this version.  Anyone
read any other current American poetry in other languages?

I'll vouch for that -- it's only the Chair he inhabits at Beau Fleuve that
is Gray. The man hisself and the work is anything but that.

Just read (aloud even, at Beaubourg, in gay Paree last month)  translations
into French of Ken Irby and Robert Kelly. Wouldn't want to comment on their
quality as I did the translations myself. The same evening heard Jean Daive
read his Robert Creeley versions. French is a tough language for to put
amerikan over and into, it tends to flatten the lines. impose melody on
what was rhythm and dull the _arete_, the sharpness, especially in as tight
and chiselled a syntax as Creeley's. But Daive has been slaving over these
for many years and has come up with creditable versions.
    Wish I were in Berlin  where Jerome Rothenberg is reading tonight no
doubt with his German translator by his side. "Cockboy" and "that dada
strain" in Hölderlinisch would be quite interesting to hear.
    Come to think of it, this very afternoon I was zu Gast at Skidmore
College in a French class to talk about my work, questions of translations,
and the poetry of Henri Michaux -- and wound up  at one point reading one
of my poems as translated into French by Michel Maire. Whenever -- rarely
-- I have done this -- always more or less forced -- it has made me feel
strange and uneasy -- an uncanny experience, completely dissimilar from
reading either my own work in the original English or that of another poet,
be it in English or in translation.

Okay okay.  I don't like candy but I'm whirling in rapid regression

I'll become embryonic. So bond away you great hunks -- and that goes for

poetics so I'm keeping it short so I won't be banished but is there a
tiredness and a crotchetiness that's affecting a lot of folks at this
tailend of the year?  Especially as the weather round these parts is
anticipating both Christmas AND summer holidays. Roll on this very last

I see that my name is being taken in vain again on this list.  Eliza
refers to "rachel loden and rachel lewinsky."  I knew that GB was having
one of his backstreet flings with Rachel *Levitsky*, or maybe just
stepped on his eyeglasses and couldn't tell us apart, but if Monica L.
has a sister in these climes I really don't want to know.  Why can't she
earn her poet laureate kneepads somewhere else, maybe on Robert Pinsky?

But anyway.  Re: the recent mishegoss, I like what Charles Mingus wrote
on a record he sold me (and many others, no doubt) through the mail:
"Thank you in this, your DISCRIMINATING purchase."

Check out Susan Wheeler's excellent "What Outside?" in the latest
_Talisman_ for more light on turf battles.  She quotes Auden's "rebuke
to Spender when Spender, flitting through the issue of a new journal,
came across a poem it pained him to envy, 'Yay!  More to raid!'"  And
later: " . . . the problem is not what happens with assimilation, a
trope that still depends upon opposition, it is rather how do we
acknowledge and yet ignore, move through, not so much to accrue the
goods (as the elect angels) but to develop the work . . . What is the
result of the *action* of inserting more interesting work into less
interesting work, or vice versa? . . . How does the culture alter by
interbreeding? . . . Now, consider the result of this codification, this
self-definition *against* an Other.  Less to raid.  Less to read.  A
snugger rug.  New-found affinities.  And a border to protect.  An
economy to support.  A kind of nationalism complete with colonizing
outposts in the classroom . . . "

I might add that Susan's own SMOKES (Four Way Books, 1998) is one of the
strongest arguments I've seen for this freedom to raid and read.

Now, when you talk about Orcas, you're talking about the trees some of
my ancestors fell out of.  The San Juan islands haven't been Brit since
the resolution of the Pig War (an altercation worthy of the POETICS
list) in 1872.  My great-grandparents, John Loudon Gow and Emilie
Harding, both of Orcas, would have looked unkindly on any suggestion
that they curtsy before Lord Bow'ring.

Dear Poetics List,

   Some of you may have wondered at the unusual blissful non-clutter of
your Poetics List mail lately without any Henry postings.  I have been
put on "review" status by the list manager for "overposting".  I'm not
sure if this is a first - is Kent here somewhere? - but I thought people
might like to know.

I'm writing to say that I understand the list manager's exasperation &
desire to have more diversity of messages posted.  And that it's
been an enlightening experience to be in the doghouse, on mandatory
fast.  Once many years ago, when I thought God had appeared to me &
I needed to get closer to Him, I fasted for 13 days.  I remember
the lightness, the heightened awareness, and riding around on my bike
observing the tinkling circus atmosphere that emanated from the
rows of commercial food establishments & shops in the neighborhood.

The Poetics List now seems to emanate the same atmosphere for me.  Once I
was part of it.  Now I am on mandatory fast.  It feels good.

Poetry is neither a product of serious-minded scholarship nor an expression
of stylish "fumiste" joie-de-vivre.  Or perhaps it CAN be these things,
but in my current hungry state I'm interested in something else.

Poetry is part of the seriousness of life in a deeper sense that scholarship
or reasoning can bear.  It's linked with those words & expressions that
transform us.  I am not thinking of the velvet metamorphoses of an Ovid or
a Rilke or even a Shakespeare, but of those words - those few words -
that make a path into and through the depths of experience.  We inhabit
a reality of heavens and hells which is moving inexorably toward
either disaster or joy, and is climaxed for each of us & for those
we love by a terrifying unknown - or at least a suspenseful unknown.
We are possessed by love which overtakes us & transfigures everything.
These are the things that a poet tries to become worthy to express.

The world is large & poetry is deep, sublime and profound.  We should
be careful we don't deaden the awareness of its presence with our
tinkling cymbals.

- Henry Gould

_Beneath The Underdog: His World As Composed by Mingus_ by Charles
Mingus

Now, the middle can be a bit slow-going. But the beginning and the end
have brilliant moments including "Why this is not as good as being
treated privately by my own psychologist, or HELLVIEW OF BELLEVUE." Also
of note are the sections in which great live jazz performances are
enacted in the text via conversations between the players, giving rise
to some interesting possibilities for examining the relationship of jazz
rhythms to "vernacular" speech.
Mandatory listening while reading this book: "The Black Saint and the
Sinner Lady."

Stein coined the phrase "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" in "Sacred
Emily." The phrase reappeared, preceded by the indefinite article, in a
later prose sketch entitled "Objects Lie on the Table": "Do we suppose that
all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" (*Operas and
Plays*; 1932).

She also used it as a circular device on her stationary for a while. The
circular version also happens, if i remember aright, in The World is Round.

A short essay entitled "Infoanimism" that grew out of Enigma n awaits you at
http://speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/EnigmanInfoanimism.html

An excerpt:

...conceive of a word that appears on the screen as being an object with its own
properties and behaviors. W.H. Auden once said that he'd give less chance of
success to a young writer who said he had something to say than he would to a
writer who said he liked to watch the way words hang around together. DHTML
allows writers to make documents in which words hang around together and interact
with each other and with the reader and possibly with other documents and readers
on the Web in ways that can be relevant to what Auden said but in radically
different ways than he had in mind.

>>     BY SEAN McMEEKIN
        This week, graduate students employed as
>>teaching assistants in the massive University of California system
>>plan to kick off the holiday season by going on strike. California's
>>graduate TAs have clashed with university administrators frequently in
>>the past decade over such matters as health insurance benefits and
>>tuition fee remissions, but this will be the first time they have
>>walked out simultaneously on all eight U.C. campuses. Never before
>>have the graduate student teachers of U.C. been so well organized, or
>>so unanimously focused on one goal: collective bargaining rights.
>>Union recognition of TAs is the bjte noire of the U.C. Regents, the
>>university's conservative governing board, and of the individual
>>chancellors who carry out their policies. So far, the Regents have
>>stubbornly resisted the drive for TA recognition in the courts, and
>>university administrators have survived brief, largely uncoordinated
>>strikes for union recognition staged at individual U.C. campuses each
>>of the last three years.
>>
>>     But the December action promises to be different. Rather than
>>try, somewhat quixotically, to shut down enormous public research
>>universities, TA strikers will deploy a "porous" picket line and even
>>encourage their undergraduate students to continue attending classes.
>>Having learned from the notorious public relations failure of a
>>semester-end strike at Yale three years ago -- when TAs graded
>>assignments but refused to release their grades, thus incurring the
>>wrath of undergraduate students and their parents -- California's
>>striking TAs will simply withdraw their labor for the month of
>>December, in effect daring their universities to hire scabs to grade
>>finals. The December walkout, which is organized and underwritten by
>>the United Auto Workers (which has branched out deeply into the
>>clerical and educational fields), may turn out to be, in the words of
>>Christian Sweeney, a leading TA organizer at UC-Berkeley, "the largest
>>graduate student labor action ever."
>>
>>     Although it has carried a lower media profile than the curriculum
>>wars and the ongoing struggle over affirmative action, the
>>ever-tightening academic labor crunch is unquestionably the central
>>issue facing higher education in America. The underemployed Ph.D. has
>>become a clichi in a job market that has seen the number of annual
>>tenure-track job openings decline for most of this decade, even as
>>undergraduate enrollments boom and class sizes inexorably rise. As
>>universities have struggled to scale back budget outlays in response
>>to decreasing public investment in higher education, they have
>>increasingly filled classrooms with cheap, temporary labor. Large
>>state schools such as the University of California have primarily done
>>this by using a surplus pool of graduate students, whose numbers have
>>exploded in the 1990s despite diminishing prospects in the academic
>>job market. Smaller universities and community colleges, lacking
>>extensive graduate programs, have largely relied on non-tenure-track
>>"adjunct" professors, who now make up well over 40 percent of the
>>academic labor force nationally, and are expected to outnumber
>>full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty by 2001.
>>
>>     The lot of the adjuncts is not a happy one. Spin magazine
>>recently published an exposi by ex-doctoral student Eric Weisband on
>>"Sucker Ph.D.s," who were gulled by a now infamous 1989 Mellon
>>Foundation report into believing "that an expected wave of faculty
>>retirements beginning in the mid-'90s would threaten the health of
>>higher education unless more college students could be persuaded to
>>apply for doctoral degrees." Professors have, as expected, retired in
>>great numbers in the 1990s, but their tenured positions have been
>>retired along with them. Because they constitute an amorphous,
>>transient and migratory work force, adjuncts have no unions and are
>>consequently even more poorly compensated, on an hourly basis, than
>>most of the unionized clerical and custodial employees of the schools
>>where they work. Even graduate TAs, such as the U.C. strikers, make a
>>better wage than adjuncts -- although adjuncts have Ph.D.s and
>>graduate students do not. Alarmed that once-full-time faculty
>>positions have been downsized into cheaper, part-time teaching
>>junkets, the Higher Education Department of the American Federation of
>>Teachers has issued a special report on "The Vanishing Professor."
>>
>>     A labor conference held at the Graduate Center of the City
>>University of New York in April 1998 has raised limited hopes that
>>adjuncts in the nation's largest urban college system might win
>>recognition through CUNY's faculty union, the Professional Staff
>>Congress. But adjuncts are still outnumbered 9-1 by full-timers on the
>>Staff Congress -- although they make up nearly 60 percent of the CUNY
>>faculty. The prospect of collective bargaining rights for adjunct
>>professors remains, for most, a laughable pipe dream.

>>     With adjuncts largely powerless, the only effective resistance

>>program enrollments, graduate students now make up nearly 60 percent
>>of U.C.'s instructional staff; full-time tenured or tenure-track
>>professors account for 20 percent; the remaining fifth are adjuncts.
>>And these TAs do not merely lead discussion sections of large lecture

>>their slogan to the test: Will the university work without them?
>>
>>     After being flooded with e-mails from undergraduates concerned
>>that their university will, indeed, not "work" without the services of
>>its graduate TAs, UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl called a
>>special meeting with TAs from Berkeley's top-ranked history department
>>to discuss the upcoming strike. Himself a history Ph.D., Berdahl hoped
>>to defuse pre-strike tensions by exchanging views with graduate
>>students he regarded as future colleagues, in their own department, in
>>a setting geared toward the "collegiality" of academic discourse.

>>     Berdahl, a Midwesterner of imposing size but extremely congenial

>>anxious to make a good impression on students who feel they barely
>>known him. His gesture of solidarity with history doctoral students
>>was not, however, received cordially. E-mails flew among history grads
>>after his Oct. 28 invitation, accusing Berdahl of "scare-tactics and
>>intimidation" among other things. But Sweeney, a second-year American
>>history grad and TA union leader, convinced his colleagues that
>>meeting with the chancellor of U.C.'s "flagship campus" offered an
>>"opportunity to communicate why we want a union with collective
>>bargaining rights and what we're willing to do to achieve that goal."
>>Two brainstorming sessions followed, in which the graduate students
>>worked out a strategy of rhetorical attack.
>>
>>     When Berdahl arrived in the conference room of the history
>>department on Nov. 12, the stage was set for an ambush. Although more
>>than half of Berkeley's current history TAs have declined, for one
>>reason or another, to walk out in December, not a single TA spoke out
>>against the strike in front of Berdahl. Galvanized by Sweeney's
>>strategic bull sessions, graduate students attending the meeting spoke
>>as one, letting forth an eloquent cascade of grievances against
>>Berkeley's academic labor practices. Unlike unionized employees of the
>>University of California, TAs do not receive regular cost-of-living
>>increases in their wages; they bore the brunt of state budget cuts on
>>higher education enacted under Gov. Pete Wilson.
>>
>>     Berkeley's graduate students, Monica Rico pointed out, won
>>limited health coverage and tuition-fee remissions in previous strike
>>actions, but these gains were granted by the university "on an ad-hoc
>>basis," and could easily be revoked in the absence of permanent,
>>union-negotiated contracts. Without collective bargaining recognition
>>for TAs, the university could, in Rico's view, continue to take
>>advantage of graduate students with impunity. After all, she
>>complained, as a TA, her "$13,000-a-year voice [doesn't] have much
>>chance of being heard." Only a union would give Rico and other TAs a
>>fair chance for "redress of grievances." Graduate students with
>>children, Vera Candiani explained to the chancellor, desperately
>>needed a certain level of "predictability": They must be able to plan
>>for future expenses without worrying about a possible revocation of
>>health benefits or a reinstitution of fees. It was in order to lock in
>>guaranteed compensation levels, Candiani declared, that "we have
>>chosen a union to represent us, [and] that is our right."
>>
>>     Against a chorus of hostile voices committed to TA unionization,
>>Chancellor Berdahl struggled to uphold an idealistic view of the
>>university as a haven of "collegial" discourse where the adversarial
>>model of the shop floor had no place. Citing his prior experience as a
>>member of the American Federation of Teachers union, and as a
>>negotiator with TA unions at the University of Oregon, where he had
>>been associate dean of undergraduate education, Berdahl argued that
>>"collective bargaining isn't a dialogue." Because each group involved
>>employs agents, "professional negotiators ... whose purpose is to win
>>a point," the upshot of unionization was, in Berdahl's estimation, "to
>>utterly destroy hope ... of collective conversations on either side of
>>the table." Because of their devotion to "collegiality" and
>>constructive "dialogue," universities were in the chancellor's view
>>"not factories ... not like any other industry." And yet, when pressed
>>by one graduate student to explain the ongoing "outsourcing" of
>>academic labor in the 1990s -- the employment of adjuncts -- Berdahl
>>tacitly admitted that in this instance, the factory model may have
>>invaded the academy. This did not mean, however, that unionization was
>>the answer.
>>
>>     "Unions," Berdahl reminded the history TAs ominously, "have not
>>prevented [corporate] downsizing." Nor would recognition of TAs' right
>>to bargain collectively, he warned, necessarily "lead to different
>>decisions by the university" on employment practices than would
>>otherwise be made. Even while declaring allegiance to the lofty ideals
>>of academia, Berdahl hinted, none too subtly, that he was willing to
>>bow to the bottom line if necessary.
>>
>>     The hidden subtext of Berdahl's warning was this: Graduate

>>scholarship, who provide cheap research assistance and who are, almost
>>by definition, eager to please professor-mentors who act as
>>all-powerful gatekeepers to academic success.

>>     But from the standpoint of university administration, graduate
>>students are a luxury. They are not merely paid more than adjuncts

>>fellowships, research and travel grants, and by tying up significant
>>quantities of professors' own teaching time and office hours. Compared

Actually,

it was a solo reading of the whole of Ketjak, in September 1978 (20 years
ago!), at the original branch of the Bank of America, #1 Powell Street,
directly in front of the cable car turnaround,

and then, several years later (1982 or 83), a reading of the whole of
Tjanting at the Church Street Muni Metro station with some 26 odd (some very
odd) people assisting.

The latter would have been in a BART station if I could have gotten
permission to do so, but I was able to wrangle it from Muni because I knew
two members of the Public Utilities Commission, one from my work as a
political organizer and the other being John Sanger, whom the sharp-eyed on
this list will recognize as having been (1) the producer of the David Lynch
film _The Elephant Man_; (2) Michael Palmer's upstairs neighbor during much
of the 1970s; (3) the director of the very last TV episode of Twin Peaks.

I have written books on public transit, but never given a reading on same.

A).     Because I am dumb and cannot defend myself, I try to ignore those who
        slight me. When I am at my best, and my being is working like a
        glinty and powerful bike, I do not even notice it when people
        slight me, for I am as the spiff pedals pumping over the leaves.

B).     And yes in deference to Henry Gould's recently smuggled and very
        wise words about poetry and despite them furthermore I would like
        to say the following to Elliza McGrand, and then get on to one or
        two points regarding this holy order that is our Poetry:

Dear Impostor:

I like it best when you are mute.

It is fundamentally important you understand at least 3 (three) of the 5
(five) reasons I have attested in court to your derangment:

The First:      You remind me of a dog hurled over a roof:
                yapping to no effect.

The Second:     Yes I WAS the disturbed looking individual over there
                shouldering a rifle with one arm and a shovel with the other.
                My intention? To dig myself to hell where I planned to find
                and threaten the mud-mouthed beast who wrote "as for gaga
                let us put a veil over him."

For Third:      Though I have been accused of infliction with Halitosis
                of The Keyboard, it is my fundamental impression, poetry
                can survive even the holy art of insult hence I insult you.

May you bang into the roost of an eagle.

An hungry eagle. An hungry angry people-hater of an eagle who cannot be
suade by the cheap talk of which you are so overfond dear manic impostor.

yrs, gaga

        "Mercy on us, that God should give his favourite children, men,
        mouths to speak with, discourse rationally, to promise smoothly, to
        flatter agreeably, to encourage warmly, to counsel wisely: to sing

        them into mouths of adders, bears, wolves, hyenas, and whistle
        like tempests, and emit breath through them like distillations of
        aspic poison, to asperse and villify...."

Mercy on us, indeed.  We can give words, I think, Henry, but Mercy comes
from elsewhere, maybe from the big G (not me), maybe from Poetry, who
knows: but thank you (and this from a profaning person) for reminding
us.  gg

It's been a lot of years now, but as I recall I read somewhere (sorry, can't
remember the source) there was speculation that the first 'Rose' in this
phrase in fact was a person's *name*.  If this is true it gives the phrase
an entirely different shading.

Been reading Richard Holmes bio Shelley The Pursuit, which, along with
his bio of Coleridge's early life, is some of the best biography I've
ever dragged my eyes across. I've been hearing that the second part of
Holmes' Coleridge bio is out or out in England or about to come out &
wonder if anyone can verify this.

I'd third or fourth the recommendation of Hoa Nguyen's Dark, & say as
well that eyes can be kept out for another collection of Nguyen's, Hood,
which ought to be out some time in 1999 from Buck Downs' Books.

Last week staying in my cousin's room for a couple nights I read four or
five Calvin & Hobbes books & remembered that that's where I got my
poetics from, along with Dickinson & the New York Post. Plus a creepy
Children's Bible to rid myself of some plague pictures that have haunted
me worse than the albino roach families on St. Mark's Place; & flipped
through Hakeem Olajuwon's autobiography which gave me a feeling inside.

One other thing, a book by Sparrow called Republican Like Me, a
diary/account/poetry boke of Sparrow's 1996 campaign against Dole for the
repub. presidential nomination, is one of the funniest things I've read
all year. It's from Soft Skull Press.

Henry's recent use of another person's account to send messages to to
the list will only aggravate an already difficult situation, I assure
you. And for what it is worth, I have long advocated that this list
become a MODERATED list, even while mostly maintaining an atmosphere of
an open forum (not free). Charles has resisted this, though I think he
is being principled, stubborn. I realize that this is an unpopular
position, and I am used to taking unpopular positions.

Most of the people who were on this list when it began are now long
gone. Some of them have started lists deriving their interests from the
original intention of this one, while maintaining a limited scope and a
limited "membership." For me, this list has always been an extension of
the poetry and poetics community constituted around certain ideolologies
and circumstances, whether poetix communities, graduate school programs,
etc. It isn't about VIRTUAL anything--that is a bunch of cosmic cyber
hype. The emphases reflected here, it seems to me, are related to these
interests as expressed in the Welcome Message, which is reiterated
monthly. Charles has never apologized for the intended focus of this
list, nor should he. There are plenty of other lists, with differnt
interests, foci, and rules of conduct. This list has to be run by
someone, and only recently has the notion of pulling the plug on this
forum become something resembling a real possiblity. Most of the people
that I know who have left the list usually indicate that the low-quality
of the conversation, the incessant chat-like behavior, etc., as the
major reasons for their departure. Many of them have mentioned Henry
(and others) as reasons for their departure. For what it's worth, if
this list were moderated (and I was the moderator), most of what Henry
has written would be fine with me. Always at issue (at least as far as I
can tell) has been the sheer number of posts, the insistence that every
post must be replied to, even if with a one-liner. (which isn't to say
anything about the nastiness--even my post about my trip to LA was met
publicly with scorn and derision--and there many subtle things in there
that I was trying to indicate were missed completely, cast off as being
ass-kissing &whatnot. Certainly not the kind of response that has me
wanting to participate. In any event, it doesn't really matter what I
think)

But on that note, I think it is time to end this list as it is presently
known. Charles probably does not agree with me, and he has he reasons, I
am sure. Perhaps one of the disaffected here will rise to run their own
listserv program, listbot (like Kinsella's succssful PoetryEtc list).
And it isn't that I wish to become the moderator. I am tired of being
demonized for doing my job and I think that the next poetics list
manager will want to take a more proactive role. There is no reason that
this list has to mimic the worst aspects of l.f. capitalism or the
fantasy of free speech.

I think this list has become too large to hear everyone.
Too few people dominate an increasingly paranoid conversation.

joel et alia (including absent henry):

do we, picking up ELF, or Lipstick, or Nedge, expect every single article,
each sentence of every article, to be wildly interesting and germaine?  i
do not.  expect that there will be a few poems, maybe an article or two, that
i will have been glad to have read.  perhaps there will be a poem that will
really break into me, or a short story, that i'll think about for a long
time.  maybe an idea in an essay, or maybe a review that makes me go read
something new.  that is an even better thing.

poetics list... i feel as if i have a very primitive awful mail handler, but
maybe i'm better off than many?  except most people here seem to have eudora.
in my program messages come with sender and header.  if header is on topic
i'm not interested in, i delete.  ditto, if sender annoys me.  poetics list...
every day, there is at least one new idea.  several message that amuse.
suggestions to read things that i tuck away and try and follow up on.  new
places to send work.

poetics list... i get in a stupid argument with a neighbor who thinks monica
lewinsky was a whore and should be arrested and its her fault clinton fooled
around anyway, or another real life example, god sent AIDS to kill gay people
because they are evil.  and i get home, or terminal at work, plug into
poetics, and read about... use of spaces in poem.  quote from zukofsky.  new
magazine from toledo ohio.  an argument on whether a writer writes for audience,
and should she/he.  a report from a conference on laura riding.

yes, there is dreck, but there is also lots of gold.  now joel, you say people
complain and de-sub.  that is part of net space, lists, in general.  i'm on
an outing club list, and every year, freshman join the list, then bumble around
and flood list with requests to unsubscribe.  people join lists thinking they
are going to be one thing and they turn out to be another.  you seem to be
forgetting something -- the list has 700 subscribers.  700 people who joined
and stayed on.  that is pretty unbelievable.  to complain on the one hand
that people are quitting, while complaining that list is too big?... see a
contradiction?

tone.  i liked your report from la.  earmarked it and meant to write you a
note welcoming you back.  lost it in my savage email program.  one of my
profs once said, about class reviews, you can get 26 glowing ones, but what
you'll remember and brood about is the one that panned you.  i recall people
enjoying report from la.  there were surely lots of people like me who meant
to write and didn't, but would have written warm and happy-to-hear-from-you
notes.  tone in general. yes, poetics in general can be bitchy, snipping,
mean-spirited.  even, at times, downright ugly.  welcom to cyberspace.  i've
never yet seen a list without flames, and poetics has had fewer than any
other i've been on or read from.

henry.  this whole thing puzzles me.  there were posts in the last round
that sucked -- mean, careless, sweeping and silly.  but henry?  he has
consistently fought to bring up "poetics" questions, has asked those wild
interesting abstract questions, included a scintillating corruscory of
wordplay, wit, erudition.  and calm.  even his irritated posts are informed.
so, like you, i would keep his posts.  frequency?  there are days he is
about the only one posting.

frequency.  easier solution -- programmers out there, i know this can
be done in pascal.  we can ask that it be done by conscience.  suppose
we set number, say, 3 posts per day max.  if you want to post more than
3, you wait till end of day and if total posts < 50, you post your >3 post(s).
or could be set into programming -- each sub gets n=3 posts accepted,
>3 posts get sent into queue.  if total number (N) of posts N =< 35, say,
then queue released.

moderator: should utterly foolish flame posts be deleted?  on the one hand,
we don't have to read, or get het up about them.  on the other hand, maybe
foolish flame poster can learn from seeing response to post?  on other hand,
are we here to teach.  on other, why not screen the worst?  final thought:
comparatively speaking, very few flames overall, and large number of happy
subscribers (or reasonably so, remember, you can vote with your feet).  why
fix what ain't broke.  as a community, i think people know how to punish
those perceived as out of line.  and if you are bored with a line of inquiry,
indicate same backchannel and delete front channel.  easy, n'est ce pas?

final: with every post, i see people in sturdy tweed suits bearing down
upon me ready to slap me silent with their mortarboards.  that is my problem.
i can imagine people such as would (and doubtless do) loath everything i say --
i've had roomates like that.  does that mean i cease to speak?  i also get
backchannel and frontchannel posts thanking me for posts about every time i post.  have to figure it evens out.  in my paranoia, i can easily now imagine
i am one of the ones "frequently complained about."  does that mean i hoard
up each congratulatory post, canvass friends to post "Great Post" posts,
so that i have ammunition against the complainers?  wouldn't that generate
an awful lot of boring trash?  why not just stopcomplaining to list
moderators and take matters into our own individual, honest, taking
responsibility, saying to face anything we have to say and not sneaking
around behind people, etc. selves and write anyone we think is posting
inappropriately, or in mean way, etc. ourselves BACKCHANNEL.  and leave
poor charles/joel/list/etc. out of it?  people getting enough complaints
probably would, i would think, do something about it themselves.

i hope none of the 700 (including you, joel, whose warm, funny, explorative
posts i have always enjoyed) unsub, and that lots of the silent 700 pipe
up.  if you hate me, my posts, the horse i rode in on, write me and leave
charles/joel/etc. alone.  maybe we can figure out something together.  if
you like me, my posts, my horse, write me if you feel like it.  sez i.

Joel,

I agree with a lot of what you said. Personally, I think this List has
become an enormous drag: the goading and near-flames only somewhat less
annoying than the nice-nice posts that could better be back-channeled and
other things that are probably intended to be witty comments that don't
quite cut it on e-mail.

But I stay for two reasons: 1) vulnerability to the definition of the List
made in last year's ILS Dictionary: "inane chatter; check constantly," and
2) inane as it is, it is read at work where my e-mail access is, and breaks
up the day.

And then posts announcing new publications, readings, reading reports, trip
reports, and reading lists make it worthwhile.

I have little sympathy for the people too delicate to participate. This
list is anarchy; everyone can type and send a message from a level ground.
Everyone can read each post in turn. No post is louder than another or
arrives with greater authority than another. Maybe this list is boring as a
result, but there is little or no flaming and that has been due either to
peer pressure or mutual respect, whichever you prefer.
You can delete posts wholesale; I do this regularly.

But I really meant to say something in defense of Henry Gould. His posts
may outnumber anyone else's but I have never read them as being malicious
or mean-spirited. There are many other over-chatty people too. Why not
censor (or moderate) them too? Why not limit posts to one per-person each
day? That ought to make one think before one writes.

Also, anyone who follows up a mistakenly-sent post to this List with an
apology for doing so should be immediately reprimanded (via back-channel).

I know of a Listserv organized as an alternative this one. It's closed (or
restricted) to prevent it from turning into this one. It's riddled with its
own problems as a result.

having no answers to anything,

Joel's judicious post raises some disturbing issues. Is it really apocalypse
time for the venerable List? I for one would miss it terribly. And yet, my
participation in the conversation has gone - over the course of three years
- from timidly lurking to avidly active to overwhelmed by it all. Has the
list become a victim of its own success? Or am I just busier than I used to
be and suffering from List fatigue? I'm not sure I agree with Joel that the
quality of the talk has waned all that significantly. Sure, there's a lot of
happy gabbing that goes on - some of it rather amusing, some of it not - but
I still find much here that is absorbing, instructive or provocative. If I
had the time, I'd give a rundown of my own personal highlights from the past
3 months or so. One that does come to mind was the animated dialogue around
issues of teaching "racist" texts in the classroom that Aldon Nielsen and
others vigorously pursued. Another would be the issue of the legacy of
Language Poetry that was taken up by Mark DuCharme, Mike Magee and many
others. Of course the very form of this List militates against consensus -
rightly so, I think, however frustrating that may be - and unfortunately, it
also amplifies silliness into plain nastiness.

But beyond the intrigue of debating various poetics issues, the List has
great value for me in two of the things Charles designed it for: the
announcements of readings and events; and the announcement of new
publications. This may strike many as banal, but by performing this
quotidian service the List provides a sense of continuum or environment
where information about "fellow travelers" and their activities is no longer
fated to wither away on some local vine, but enjoys a kind of second bloom
through its dissemination here. The number (and quality) of poetic and
critical texts I've learned of here is simply staggering and I'm very
grateful for the opportunity they've given me to delve more deeply into
poetics. Where else can one find about these things?

Rather than impeach the List, ought we not to censure and move on?

actually, Ron read BART on BART, but since he doesn't move his lips when he
reads his writing in progress nobody heard it --  I tried using the
chapbook cover as a BART ticket and almost got away with it, but the other
pages kept getting stuck in the machine --

I used to practice bus riding as a mode of performance art when I still
lived in DC -- but then they started putting poems on the bus and my team
of lawyers advised me that my work violated fair use by this incorporation
of copyrighted materials --

(nearly all of _Evacuation Routes_ was written on the bus that runs between
Georgetown and Howard University -- the drivers used to cut me some slack
on the fare if I read to them en route)

Not that anyone here will care, but having just gotten on this list, I am
dismayed about talk of its apocalypse. Some of the ideas regarding limiting
the number of posts may be useful, but for me the list is wonderfully
fulfilling in its grandeur as well as allowing me the pleasure of rubbing my
pixels next to the high-profile individuals who frequent here. The
publications and urls for webpages and magazines have been a blessing...
Trying to use Yahoo or other search engines just doesn't cut it. So, I'd
rather spend my hours wading through the bickering and bitchiness of the poets
here to find even one impressive site than to wallow in impersonal boolean
searches. It seems the personalities here are strong, and egoes even stronger,
but thank god for the smuggled-in Henry Gould email. His comment about "Poetry
is part of the seriousness of life" makes me glad. I miss him and wish he were
back. Henry said it so well in that message: "We are possessed by love which
overtakes us & transfigures everything. These are the things that a poet tries
to become worthy to express." And it seems to me this is what Henry has been
attempting (for the most part) with most of his messages. A humorous nudge
here, a dialectic tug there, back toward the direction/discussion of poetry.

well if it's come to a vote then:

henry's posts are usually a scream... so free hg, yes, but by all means

FREE LEONARD PELTIER

the list, all said and done, is quite valuable to me, if not quite a
blessing... i am grateful for it... i would preach (as you all know by now)
self-policing rather than moderation... (i know this may not always work,
and i'm not aligning mself with/against anyone here, and i don't mean to
sound panoptical... but i think joel's "unsub" was sent in the spirit of
trying to get folks to listen to themselves)...

db:  no hard feelings, but i DO have sympathy, not for "delicate" ears
(fuck that), but for those who feel attacked/excluded... this is a judgment
call, of course, and i won't rehearse what i've already writ re same... but
sometimes it's downright clear to me when someone/some group is feeling
attacked/excluded... and though i can certainly hit the <delete> key quick
as anyone (to eliminate some of the godawful trivia that floats by my eyes,
e.g.) i don't think that's the whole answer to things getting nasty...

btw, so far i've enjoyed some of the posts writ in order to defend the list
(as it were) than a lot of what i've seen prior (incl. of course my own
volumes)... make of it what you will, i'm trying to mself...

best,

joe

I second Aldon's views.  Sure, there are times when this List gets
tedious.  But those times, no doubt, are different for each of us.
There will be stretches of more delete, and stretches of more rapt
engaged attention.  I, too, have found the list to be very
informative.  I hope the list continues in its somewhat anarchice
current manner.

I don't know what all this "handwringing" is about and I don't
paticularly relish sounding like an ACLU lawyer defending the Neo-Nazi's
right to march in Skokee, but yesterday in the throws of a three day
migraine that's rolled into four, I reread issues of the Lewis/Pound
mag, Blast. It occurred to me that Lewis and Pound would have definitely
been scoured from this list or would have faced a lesser punishment if
they had brought to the list the prestige of their historical
reputations. I won't go into the irony of Gab's wack at Pound in an
earlier post and the decided similarity between his post and Blast's
visceral postions. A passionate tactic, perhaps.
Opportunity here is open ended.
Blast! Dammit! Joe! This is our roots. No wonder we come off as a
marginalized group of fops. What's the difference between moderation and
censorship? This is how the academy/nonacademy shit gets started.
I hope this post meets the content requirement. Now, I'm going to lapse
back into the delicious nausea and pain of the four day migraine.

s I've already said recently, I'm one of those who have been frustrated
with the quality of discussion on the list.  But I also hate the idea of
some sort of strict control being imposed, and I'm not crazy about the
idea of policing particular people either.  What I'd *like* to see happen
is for people to exercise greater self-control on their own, but I guess
it's unlikely that this will happen.
I'm coming around, then, to the idea that a single post per day limit
might be a very good compromise.  No particular person's posts would have
to be restricted; everyone would operate under the same limitation.  The
abuse of the list by over-posters like Henry would be eliminated (and I
see this as a major problem--though I read many of Henry's posts--perhaps
even as much as a tenth or a twentieth of them--with great interest).  It
would also be much more difficult for flurries of sniping and obstreperous
back-and-forth exchanges to dominate any given day.  When tempers flared
there would be a built-in cool-off period, etc.

I still like too much about the list to want to see it come to an end,
so maybe we can do something to make it work better.  steve

Once a day?  Cheez.  Back-and-forth is _fun_.  I mean here I am grading a
stack of papers or something and I turn on the list and there is db
flirting with db and what could be lovelier?

Just try to keep it short folks...

More seriously, I think a lot of the tiresomeness is people trying to tell
us what they meant to say or how somebody didn't understand what they said
or justifying what they've already said or etc.  Here are Judy's Simple
E-Rules for E-Etiquette:

1.  Never defend.

2.  If you've said it once don't say it again.

And of course there is the every-important

3.  Never attack.

These work pretty good at meetings too.  But hey I wouldn't shut anyone up
for not sticking to what are, after all, just my own personal rules.

Cheers.

On the contrary. I think the number, tenor, quality, wit, wisdom,
inanity etc. of the posts should be entirely open ended. Remember
Wabash.---Carlo Parcelli
P.S. Blast! is great to read when your suffering double vision from a
migraine---the prints so large.

you're interesting article speaks to issues that make for a tough poetics,
particularly in the way your explanations and definitions re DHTML suggest
distinct but somehow integrated layers of text / i've chatted with 'coder'
friends about the idea of 'hidden languages' -- akin i think to your 'neath
text' -- and like to think sometimes that poetry writes a hidden text, ie,
'neath' the popular languages of commerce and company xmas parties / i'm
troubled i guess by the way items start to stack up though when we venture
into this layering mode -- one passage in your essay in particular i kept
coming back to:

"When we look at documents on the Web, we see text and graphics and
controls and so forth. But upon understanding the basics of DHTML, we begin
to see the 'neath text, what's unseen but present in the source code and
begin to reconceptualize the document as a collection of objects with
properties that can be changed in real-time. The objects can also respond
to changes in the other objects or initiate changes in the other objects.
And changes can be caused either by the underlying logic of the neath text
or be caused by the reader's responses to the visible manifestation of the
document."

"understanding the basics of DHTML" i guess is similar to knowing the
sacred code / or for me at least the quasi-mysticism of the 'neath' text or
the "unseen but present" in the source code brings up a lot of questions
about the user-devotee's relation to this code, degrees of understanding,
etc. / i read the above as a statement regarding in fact your
reconceptualization of the document after experimenting with Dhtml, rather
than what is necessarily a reader-viewer's response -- it then dovetails
into a description i think of general DHTML functions, ie, what can be done
with it in composing a document, and this i think is a different issue
altogether -- a craft thing comparable to discussing pigment in relation to
color, or instrumental timbre in relation to orchestral sound

when i look at "enigma n" (http://speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/enigmanie.htm)
i see an animated anagram (a good one), and the chaotic cycling of the
letters puts some thoughts in motion regarding letters-in-relation,
meaning, and 'meaning' as a composite of letters "signifying nothing" -- a
fun puzzle indeed / i'm intrigued by this because it enters into a long
tradition of word art centering on the anagram (reading lately the Ren.
philosopher Bruno who saw in the arrangement of letters the "potential
elements of new worlds") / while i know your discussion of document
'objects' above is from a coder-writer's perspective, here and elsewhere in
your essay the determinism of the language bothers me a bit / later you
write that viewing a doc in DHTML "allows us to conceive of a word that
appears on the screen as being an object with its own properties and
behaviors." -- i don't think DHTML allows this so much as it and other
languages and applications provide interesting tools for formalizing
practices long in development and which hardly "begin" with DHTML / i grant
there are differences, but i'd rather call them differences of degree not
kind and spend time clarifying those degrees

languages neath languages concealing languages is an interesting idea but
in definite need of some crisper articulations of exactly what gets
revealed and concealed and who and by what mechanisms the concealed gets
revealed / otherwise i'd like to know more about how DHtml creates a
"document as a collection of objects with properties that can be changed in
real-time."

a lot of loose questions and concerns hidden right here / thanks for
pointing to your article

all best,
bill

Speaking as one of the (usually) silent listoids riding into the valley with
the rest of the 600 +,I'm surprised at the surprise expressed over the recent
flap concerning troubling posts, insults, and childishness. Poets are, after
all, human beings. Why would anyone be surprised when they act like it?
Notions of civility are perhaps the real trouble here, not because civility is
not useful when actually achieved, but because it is less than civil to expect
others to achieve such
behviors consistently, or some to achieve it more than occasionally. After
all, sublimation is not easy, and one of the things poets often like to do is
allow the unconcious and see where it leads. Something I have very much liked
about the list is the level of tolerance that has been afforded those who do
not necessarily subscribe to the "norms" of it's behavior. Certainly it is
sometimes annoying to me to read through posts I'm not interested in or have
significant problems with. ( I occasionally delete
those I know I'm not interested in, though I usually remember that if I have a
problem with something, the problem is at least as much mine as it is the
sender's).  But I would rather have the posts there to read through or delete
than to think that people were not allowed their voice because there is a
clash around the notion of what polite behavior is.

I rather like this sort of post; it's like listening to your friends when
they're feeling silly. Of course, if you're in a bad mood, they seem irritating,
but then, if you're in a bad mood, you probably shouldn't have come to the party
(so just delete).

And I have never heard Henry say anything mean-spirited, nor do I think his
silence will induce lurkers to come forward.

It seems to me that a lot of the current problems on this list are caused
by those very same poets whom you indulgently call human
beings.  Do they know the difference between poetry and poetics, I ask
myself. Would it be possible, in the interests of moderation, to ask
subscribers to identify themselves, to the closest possible denominator,
as either poets or poeticists: or at least to make a confirmed choice.
I for one would be all for gagging the poets.  Troublemakers.

Dear Listers,

as many of you know, I have been researching in the Archive for New
Poetry, and I am preparing number of projects out of material stored
there. As I am doing this, I have treated myself to reading around in
various archives, including Lyn Hejinian's, Mac Low, and the papers and
recordings of Paul Blackburn. The recently acquired Bernadette Mayer
papers are still in-cataloging (or so Stephen Cope tells me), but I
can't wait to look at what is there, and to read the many years of
dedicated writerly (& teacherly)-ness that her archive represents.

[ pardon the long digression : there will be some reward at the end ]

What I am getting to is somewhat complicated, and is bound-up in my own
sense of the troublesome nature of this list, my relationship to it (as
lurker, sometimes contributor, and as "burrocrat" in the unfortunate
position of managing the daily comings and going--and on that note,
Michael Coffey, your server is bouncing every poetics list message and
you may want to review the poetics archive to see the hoopula of the
last 24 hours or so)))ANYHOW(((  my point, if I can return to it is that
I do as well infact appreciate the dynamic nature of this list, even as
down low as it may at times go. If I get frustrated about that, it may
be due to the deterioriating quality of my own life, living so far from
the civilization I once knew. The arguments for "sorting through and
deleting at will the inanity of the list" to find the nuggets of golden
bedraggled friendliness, sharp-witted argumentativeness, yaYaYa, this
argument falls on partially deafened ears. It comes down for me to the
question, what kind of world do I want to live in, what kind of world do
I want to help make, and what can I do to advance the goodness that I
need to see in the world in order to continue in it. You may snicker and
think that I am being all peachy, preachy, or cheeky. I'm not. Yesterday
I asked my classes if they had ever killed anyone. (We had been talking
about gun control laws--most of my students, even the ones I like and
think to be "progressive" are ardent gun freaks, not to mention the kid
who raises chickens to fight, a real-live cockfighter, if you will
pardon the expression) I was surprised in one class when a vietnam
veteran rose his hand and mentioned that he had served. While I have
many vets at the CCs where I teach, he is the only one to have seen
active combat. After discussing what it was like to live in combat--and
the students were never more attentive than when this man spoke. He
later told me that he had never told anyone what he had told the class,
and he seemed amazed at having done so. Then, after a 20 minute commute,
fighting the "inanity" of freeway traffic, etc., I asked another class
of somewhat younger students the same question. Here I learned that one
boy had held a friend who died quaking in his arms after a drive-by;
another guy (active Navy) described two shooting incidents where he was
the shooter (on the so-called streets). When reminded by a classmate
that the question was whether or not he had killed anyone, he finished
one of the stories with an "I don't know" if any the bullets he had
sprayed the playground with had inflicted deadly damage. Rather than do
time for the first story's offense, (the second in terms of chronology),
this guy was given the opportunity to enlist, and he now serves at the
North Island Naval Facility in San Diego. The point of this story--which
has to be told if anyone is to understand my growing impatience with
this list (an impatience, it seems, that few people share)--is that even
after hearing of these incidents, many of the students, including the
lovely boy who held his friend as he died, many, nay, nearly all of them
were in unanimous support of the RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS and they all, the
faithful servants of the constitution that they are, recited some
talk-show version of the 2nd Amendment. They told me that you had to
have protection. Anyhow- the conversation went on. We talked about many
things. Many of their arguments were like arguments for the
"self-moderation" many people want to see on this list. If everyone is
packing, and we're all coming to the table free & equal, then the sense
that we'll all control ourselves will win out.

I can accept this vision of things-- and I admire the good-natured
vision of the world it promotes. But I am not sure if this is a world I
can live in, finally.

Perhaps my complex emotional state makes any coherent conversation about
these issues more difficult than I had first thought. And unlike many
people on this list, I prefer longer, more developed and sustained
"arguments" rather than little lunchtime quips. While both are easily
deleted with equal force, the sustained attention required by longer
posts and more complex argumentation (even if flawed, or failed), this
attention is the activity that draws me to the list. Granted there is
much information that is exchanged--and it is my lifeline. What are
people doing? what do they want to know? what is happening?. I have
several research questions I would like to ask the group, and if I can
ever get out of these paragraphs, I will. But for me, and perhaps it is
only me (I can no longer see the trees for the forest)--I need the more
developed exchange of essayistic presentation. Is there another list out
there with similar interests requiring that kind of level of
participation? It seems that this list is for many people a kind of
infotainment. While I don't want to take that away from anyone, as Roger
Farr so eloquently entreated me earlier, I think it may be time for me
to move on and look for other pastures to graze in, other cows with
which to chew and moo. So, on that note, if someone could privately
(backchannel) me with information about other poetics lists (and I am
always surprised to hear about the number of limited,private ones out
there) I would be eternally grateful.

If you have made it this far, I am sorry to have victimized you with the
above melancholy meandering, you are in it for the whole-hog haul. [the
5th caller to send a note with the words "happy new year bubby & moby"
in the subject line to kuszai@earthlink.net will receive a Meow Press
luv-pak of newerish books]

It seems to me that much of what this list can achive has been alluded
to by people earlier today, so I won't reiterate that here. But I must
say that I think that it can be an extension of the real, and as has
been suggested privately, perhaps there should be some kind of meeting
of this particular tribe. I look forward to the Page Mothers  conference
to discuss some very important writers, such as Rae, Fanny, Lyn and
Leslie, Laura, and Bernadette, among others, I think (sorry if I'm
leaving anyone out). And I think that this space can act as a kind of
electronic (not virtual) conference space. Like Kinsella's featuring of
poets at his poetryetc list, I suggest that we begin a series of
discussions in advance of the conference scheduled for March 1999
dedicated to those writers. I don't know if Linda Russo is still on this
list: her name appears in the review-list, but like many of th 666
people on this list, I would suuspect that she is actually set to
nomail. In any case, Linda's research into women editors of poetry
magazines is one of the more exciting projects I can think of and I
would love to hear a status report if possible. I mention the possible
"conference effect" of this list to suggest A) something for us to talk
about in a constructive way (and given that, in my opinion, women
writers have produced some of the most important writing and community
development actions since 1968--including the recent Bay Area magazines
Lipstick and Outlet which I just received--such a discussion of these
writers and editors could bear importantly on what sense we make of this
current climate of which the p-list is only a small part) and B) such a
discussion could provide for a model of civic/list behavior. And if we
think of the list as a conference, someone grabbing the mic (whether it
is coolio hipster Rbt Duncan, or coolio hpster Henry G) would be
completely scandalous and inappropriate. So-- that is my suggestion. And
my suggestion, that we discuss these writers--in advance of an already
scheduled conference here at UCSD-- is only one suggestion. The subject
line could be used to announce the writer under discussion & whether it
is a reply or an advancing of a "reading" or whatnot. Ok, that's it.

It's a fascinating idea that this DHTML is a language we can somehow read and

texual or graphical), it seems to me of service namely as a metalanguage.
Metalanguages, however, are an exciting possibility (or even existing
component) in poetry. HTML and by extension DHTML are subsets of an even more
heinous beast: SGML. The idea of SGML was to break down the "objects" of a
typical published work and identify them so they could be manipulated
individually. Such identification is accomplished by surrounding the "object"
(say a title, chapter head, or footnote) with code. The code itself is further
defined by "attributes" that affect the direction, positioning, size,
orientation, etc., of the objects they define. In SGML a separate document
(sometimes called a program) is required to hold the attributes of the
objects. When the coded document is put through the seive of the attributes
document/program, voila! a formatted text appears. Now in HTML and DHTML the
attributes are themselves part of the identification process and thus a part
of the code. A browser such as Netscape is used to parse the codes, apply the
attributes, and assemble the objects. The D in front of HTML simply stands for
"dynamic." You can make things ("objects") move. Of course, with AOL (which
doesn't yet understand version 4.0 of the HTML international standard) you
can't view the "D" in the DHTML (unfortunately my current version of Netscape
doesn't seem to understand it either).

The enigma n site also uses another language Javascript (not to be confused
with Java, which is full-fledged programming language). The Javascript, which
incidentally has errors in it, speaks back and forth with (D)HTML and provides
additional functionality to a browser (such as Netscape.) The proliferation of
languages and scripts goes on and on. If there is a microkernel of truth in
all of it for use in poetry...again, I think it boils down to a metalanguage
in a language. These are clearly examples in our real world now. What if
anything can be made of this?

There are a lot of javascript texts online at this point; it's useful, be-
cause it doesn't depend on the downloading of applets. And the older ver-
sions of html are in some ways more advanced/interesting than the newer
ones, since it was billed as a _semantic_ markup language that would med-
iate between your browser/window/computer properties and the page itself
- type occupying different widths and styles depending on the window size
you've set, etc. It was fluid. The recent html versions and the use of
style sheets transform the page more into an _object,_ dynamic or not,
controlled by the author (push technology in a way).

What's interesting about javascript is that it lives in the page that's
delivered, unlike perl or java. You generally can see the script itself
with the view option in the browser.

It's very difficult to talk of languages/metalanguages or form/content, I
think with all of this. I've written about this a lot - what I call on
occasion the porousness of languages. For example, perl can run at a shell
prompt, call up shell programs, write or read shell programs - all of the
languages including scripting languages can reference each other, pass
information back and forth. What's base and what's meta is problematic.
There are markers you can use, for example saying that everything between
< and > is meta, and that will hold for the most part - at least the
browser will try and interpret it. But when you get into more elaborate
areas, the distinction blurs - look at www.jodi.org which places some of
the 'relevant' (my word) content as invisible comments - you've got to use
the view command to see it. (That's also true of some of my black on black
pages.)

I am here to respond to Joel publickly!
I too have felt frustrated with the list, too frustrated to say anything, in
fact (I appreciate Joe's comments about people who don't speak, not that I'm
yr cybervictim, no way in hell, thank you).  Time feels very precious and
easily wasted, and I don't want to spend it at a party with all these boys
who like to talk a LOT.  (You know who you are.)  Excuse my extreme left
handed feminist pull on the carstool.
Though that said I certainly have appreciated mentions here of my work
writing and editing, which have been made by two of the male persuasion,
Joel and Standard Schaefer.
I would especially like the conversation to be more thoughtful, essayish,
and most importantly about topics that feel IMPORTANT (compelling,
generative ? -- oh excuse me!) to me. Such as occurs in my small
reading/writing group here in the Bay Area, where we read a book
superclosely, and yes, sometimes get in entanglements.  I am hungry for
places to discuss writing, but much of what happens here is to me a mess.
I have had many a backchannel complaint from gal pals as well as guy pals.
I don't like to listen to anyone who talks as much as Henry.  Sorry to be
honest.

The Power of the Unhappy People

The unhappy people have great power.
They invest in the unhappiness of others.

Not generic unhappiness, the kind
of unhappiness anyone could feel,
but designer unhappiness, the exact
shape of the hole in your heart.

These are dreams without doors.  Let the blonde
demonstrator slip one around your feelings.
As it goes on, it clings like shrink-wrap.

Now the birds can cry in the night, and you
won't hear them. Or your ancestors. Or jazz.
The image of your death will dance for you
with as many veils as you please.

In your fog-coloured room, in your Queen Anne chair,
you may wish you were dead, but be glad of that wish
since it sets you above the common sort
inured to ordinary unhappiness.

And we, the investment community, will grin.
(Though like you, we cannot feel the sun or hear the rain.
Or jazz.) We will grin at the thought of you dreaming.

More & more people must become rich & unhappy,
so the original unhappy people can die rich.

Bill,

I’m told that W.C. Williams said something like ‘A poem is a machine made out of words.’ It’s odd to think it so, given the utterly human nature of many
poems. Yet there is a sense in which it’s true: language itself is surely a technology insofar as it is a tool made by people; our tools and technologies are
not dumb and lifeless externalities that we pick up at need to do a job; instead, they often are truly extensions of ourselves: extensions of our minds and
feelings and imaginations (language); extensions of our eyes (electron and radio telescopes); extensions of our memory (books); extensions of our voices
(telephones); etc. Poets are familiar with the odd feeling of seeing their poems in type, particularly in something as apparently external as a book or
magazine; it’s as though a part of themselves had somehow been transferred by machines to the external and other. There they are, our silent running soul
devices.

In a sense, I have just rewritten my little essay Infoanimism in a different context. Even the nature of the printed document needs re-examination. We freak
out about machines and say they are no part of us but the truth of the matter is quite different. It is apparently ironic that we use machines to convey our
humanity, but the irony is only apparent when we acknowledge the ghost in the machine and acknowledge also that we made the machine for the ghost to travel
in. Subtle ghost in there with “the popular languages of commerce and company xmas parties” you mention, lovely graceful ghost.

Whether a poem is spoken or written or uses dhtml, as I am amused to do these days, it is, in the above way, a machine made out of words. Dhtml poems
highlight this dramatically.

The neath text is to some forbiddingly technical and automated. Yet the ghostie may appreciate it, the ghostie neath and above and around the neath text.

Infoanimism is at http://speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/EnigmanInfoanimism.html and links to Enigma n. The link you provided to Enigma n is actually a link to
only the Internet Explorer version, Bill, but thank you anyway.

That is a little odd, that coincidence. Happens that I gave a swift and
sure account of the Pig War in my book _Bowering's B.C._ , Viking 1996,
Penguin 1997. But it took place just on San Juan Island. Some crummy Kraut
was the arbitrator and gave the island to the Yanks years later.

George, just to defend my honor, since it is clearly under siege (I
guess Brom was right when he said your dad was a schoolteacher).  If
you'll reread my post you'll notice I do not say that the Pig War took
place on Orcas Island.  I don't say where it *did* take place, sensing
somehow that this is not a matter of great fascination for the P-list.

There are 172 named islands in the San Juan archipelago, San Juan and
Orcas being two of the largest.  The point is that the line drawn by
Kaiser Willie gave all of them to the US (thus my statement that they
haven't been British since the *resolution* of the war in 1872).
Kapish?  I don't say it was right but that's how the colonial cookie
crumbles.

The war itself took place in 1859.  Witnesses to all this stupidity were
the Lummi Indians, some of whom were still living traditionally on Orcas
when my mother grew up.

Sorry to bore everyone, and slipping into deep lurk,

Rachel

I agree with the sentiments expressed - but could we add editors to the list
as a sub (human) group (species) together with agents and critics - perhaps
they could be placed in a special list of their own while the nice poets
discuss (or argue) in peace about important maters of poetry which editors
especially would have no interest or specialist knowledge.  (Only problem I
suppose is that most poets at some point get to do some editing or write
criticisms)  Oh well its a nice thought.

URGENT ACTION  OF MAIL ART

GOM@
(Global Organization of Mail Artists)

November, 26, 1998

Pinochet, the justice and Humberto Nilo

Approximately a year ago, the Director and Academic of the Arts School of
the University from Chile, Humberto Nilo Saavedra, promoted a Mail Art call
to please the freedom in education for the arts. Months later, he was
expelled from his chair. The dictatorship continued operating. Now, the
ex-dictator and Chilean life senator, Augusto Pinochet, has been arrested .
In such an unexpected way, he is in the custody of the court in England as =
a
result of the request for extradition from a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garz=
=C3=B3n.
The charges are for more than 90 crimes of genocide, international terroris=
m
and tortures. Faced with the danger that the process can be stopped by
Spanish reactionary forces, we asked for solidarity to all the mail artists
for justice to be strictly applied.

The group AU MA+gom@ (Urgent Action =E2=80=93 Mail Art), consider the first=
 stage of
this project to be closed, once achieved that both Spanish and English Cour=
t
sentenced the ex-dictator and Chilean life senator, Augusto Pinochet, must
to be put in trial for crimes of genocide, international terrorism and
torture.

For these crimes, Pinochet was requested by the laws of several countries
(Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland...and others). The extradition
proceedings will take time. However, we consider the precedent established
will make possible to be optimists about the make up of an International
Court to fight the crimes against humanity.

On the other hand, our campaign was mainly aimed at Mail Art world, even
thought a lot of people from another circles did identify with our call. In
that respect, we want to declare that our report of the case of Humberto
Nilo -ex Director of the University of Chile=E2=80=99s Fine Art School, who=
 was
dimissed from his position after the organization of the Mail Art exhibitio=
n
"Stop: liberty, diversity and pluralism"- is still not solved. Because this
reason, we will continue making all efforts to give him back his position.

de m=C3=A1s de 90 delitos por genocidio, terrorismo internacional y tortura=
=2E Ante
el peligro de que el proceso sea detenido por fuerzas reaccionarias
espa=C3=B1olas, solicitamos a todos los mail artistas su solidaridad para q=
ue la
justicia se aplique con todo rigor.



EL COLECTIVO AU MA+gom@ (Acci=C3=B3n Urgente - Organizaci=C3=B3n Mundial de=
l Mail
Art), da por concluida la primera etapa de este proceso, una vez conseguido
que tanto los tribunales espa=C3=B1oles como los ingleses hayan sentenciado=
 que
el ex-dictador Chileno y senador vitalicio Augusto Pinochet, debe ser
juzgado por los m=C3=BAltiples crimenes de genocidio, terrorismo internacio=
nal y
tortura.
Delitos cuyo procesamiento ha sido solicitado por diversos pa=C3=ADses.(Esp=
a=C3=B1a,
Francia, Alemania, Suiza...) El proceso de extradici=C3=B3n, probablemente =
ser=C3=A1
largo. Pero consideramos que a partir de estos momentos, el precedente
sentado permitir=C3=A1 contemplar con nuevas perspectivas la formaci=C3=B3n=
 de un
Tribunal Internacional para combatir los cr=C3=ADmenes
contra la humanidad.
Por otro lado, nuestro manifiesto iba dirigido al universo del Mail Art, qu=
e
es donde nos movemos. Bien es cierto que al mismo se han sumado otras
personas y colectivos que se han identificado con nuestro llamamiento. En
este sentido, queremos dejar constancia de que nuestra denuncia por el caso
del ex-Director de Bellas Artes de la Universidad de Chile, Humberto Nilo,
expulsado de su c=C3=A1tedra despu=C3=A9s de organizar una covocatoria de M=
ail Art por
"La Libertad en la Ense=C3=B1anza de las Artes", no ha sido solucionado. Es=
 por
ello que proseguiremos en nuestro esfuerzo para que le sea restituido su
cargo.

I object to the censorship being imposed on henry for allegedly posting too

for the quality of his "content," a word that more than smacks of exclusionary
elitism.  as a matter of fact, I often enjoy reading henry's posts -- and his
commitment to, and passion for, art is, from my point of view, beyond
question.  as for the content issue, there are certainly more trivial remarks
posted everyday than anything that gabriel has posted.  to single out these
two poets seems to me to be wrongheaded, whatever the rationale.  much more
obnoxious is the assumption that anyone, solely because of proprietary
interests, should take it upon themselves to arbitrarily restrict either the
frequency or quality of the work of other list members without anything
resembling due process.  those who advocate freeing henry, gabriel & kent
johnson have it wrong -- we need to free charles and his clones from the
mistaken assumption that exclusion and censorship are the appropriate
responses to what are essentially political and aesthetic differences.

My Dear Sir I cannot forward yr post below as I have received from
Bernstein a note from his twelve lawyers via fax late late last night,
waking me, the printing of which fax was so greatly jangling and rattling
for some reason, as if vile counsel's words were actually BUMPY.  Couldn't
believe roaring threats. anyway upshot is (1) the "pressure" lastly
mentioned yesta'day in hasty subterranean note to Gould was my own leaden
chagrin at having fuckeditup, story of my life, Secondly I think the tree
outside my window to the right is about to pop into bloom you should see
this thing, birds billeted all over it, fuck-a-duck. Fourth, I sick all
stinking apologies to this list as if it were a delicate thing:  if it's
going to die let it die, but i say we don't kill it by apologizing and as
parceilli wrt 'handranging" not kill it. And ninthly CERTAINLY let's not
kill the vitality of it, for what brought the stupid gaga to list was
henry's messages, posts of genius, & good lord i LOVE this list and what i
learn from it and what PRAXIS of OPEN THINKING it gives me and how i am
eternally GRATEFUL for this COMMUNITY buffalo PROVIDES, its BOUNTY, the
buffalo BOINKY OF BOUNTY, the furthermore and tenth and lastly I cannot
post but a "few" times a week, so I'm waiting until tomorrow when I will
post a Violent Bomb of Words which will beckon wrath of ALL in the goddamn
name of WAKEY-UPPEY, at which action List will be restored to former Henry
state of affairs, this being the terminal action of my own soldiering,
whence i will with dainty personal decency begin again my own annoying
postings of hack and drama. yours with weapons of pewter & foil, GAGA

Excuse my fogginess on this issue but, has Henry actually been banned from
posting on the list?  If so, this seems absolutely outrageous to me!
Joe's sentiment that "Henry's commitment to, and passion for, art is, from
my point of view, beyond question" is absolutely true and quite
pertinent.  I've rassled with him as much as anyone but the idea
that we would somehow keep him from posting really disgusts me.
I hope I've got this wrong.   -Mike.

Subject:      perhaps another suggestion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I enjoy the open-ended nature of the list and the chance for give
and take, but like Steve Shoemaker and some others I also believe too high
a number of posts per list to the day by a single person has a habit of
shutting conversation down--at a total of only 50 allowable messages a
day, it's literally NOT true that anyone can say anything at any time--a
concerted attempt to post many times a day does effectively shut out the
possibility of other people posting to the list.

        While it seems to me that one post per day may cut out too much
potential give and take, I'd like to suggest a limit of TWO posts per day,
and I'd like to suggest that the owner of the list could and should write
a limit on the number of posts into the official Welcome List information.
Why two per day? Well, it does allow for response--you can both make your
post and respond to any and all who respond to you on the same day,
provided you can restrain yourself long enough to allow those other posts
to come in. It might even have the added virtue of making people think
further about how they're going to respond--while everybody would still be
welcome to fire back as quickly as possible if they felt like it, they
would do so with the awareness that one quick jab a day is all they're
going to have.

        I would even suggest that a person who posts THREE times a day
should not be given a warning until, say, perhaps the third time they've
overposted. An initial warning at the third time, a second warning at time
number four, and at time number five having their posting privileges taken
away for a limited period of time, say perhaps one or two months.
Individuals who post more than three times a day should receive one
immediate warning, a second warning, and then be removed from the list on
a third occasion.

        Obviously, the exact nature of the numbers here should clearly be
subject to adjustment. But while I think nothing can or should be done
about the tone, etc, of various posts, however frustrating that can be, I
do think something can and should be done about individuals who actually
do take away from the democracy of the list by their attempt in some
literal sense (whether conscious or not) to SEIZE message space.

        I would encourage Charles and Joel, again, to write such
limitations into the initial message list, and I believe that these
limitations will HELP the democratic nature of the forum. But I would
further suggest the following--that perhaps a VOTE by the members of the
list on the issue of such limitations is also possible. A motion could be
put forward by the list owners--people who cared to vote on the issue
would have say a week period in which to register their vote.

        I look forward to any discussion of this or other possibilities
for enabling some level of list modernation that does not in fact
constitute censorship.

        Mark Wallace

As a staunch proponent of the single post per day platform, I must
strenously oppose Mark Wallace's suggestion that *two* posts per day be
allowed.  Wallace's proposal, it should be pointed out, *doubles* the
number of allowable posts and so leaves us precariously poised at the very
brink of a slippery, indeed *exponentially* slippery slope:  what next--4
posts per day? eight?
sixteen? thirty-two?  No, my friends, our only salvation lies in the
Single, the Unitary, the One.

Oh, ok, I actually think Mark's plan is a better one--it had already
occurred to me after I made my post, but of course it would have been too
unseemly to violate my barely formulated single-post principle by making
*another* post that same day...  steve

mark

as i pointed out in my post on this issue, there is a limit on total posts,
i.e. 50 per day, BUT, BUT, many, in fact most, days go by without limit
being reached.  why say people can only post once, or twice, a day, on
the premise that with 50 as max more posts will shut people out, when
even with multiple posters, the great majority of days we do not reach
50.  remember, everytime we exceed 50 list gets frozen and that wierd
paranoic reaction among those who haven't experienced frozen list occurs,
and we haven't had that in WEEKS.

as i also suggested earlier, one could ask for a simpler self control
mechanism, with possibly a programming routine built in.  i verymuch
like your notion of waiting till all resaponses are in, and posting
collective answer as means of cutting posts down, rather than posting
quick multiple jabs.

but, how about initial suggestion: each person gets max 3 posts day.
at post (p) > 3, posts get shunted into queue.  if total number of posts
(N) =< 35, say, or 40, by say 11 pm, then queue gets released.  otherwise,
it is released on next day.

or, if same done as self control, you ask people to post max 3, 2 if list
mail heavy that day, and wait till 11:30 pm to post any more, or send any
additional postings to subsidiary queue area where it is released if
N =< 35 or 40 by 11pm.  or, if that sort of programming impossible, make
it total honor system, i.e. don't post more than 3 until 11:30 pm, if there
is still room.

there have been days where there were maybe 10, 15 posts.  to sit about and
frown and sit on people saying don't want too many posts when there were, in
fact, not many posts, seems a bit heavyhanded.  i realize i'm acting like
a prickly rule-hating anarchist-stereotype poet/writer here, bu
but i yam what i yam, old sweet potato...

I could not agree more with Mark Wallace's suggestion.  Could we
consider giving a warning, though, before the third and final warning
(re: offence number five), so that offenders will know that this warning
(i.e., the ultimate rather than penultimate warning I am proposing)
will result in the immediate stripping of posting privileges for the
agreed upon length of time (I think this aspect of Mark's post requires
further refining).  By the way, as I will not be teaching next semester,
I may be available for the monitoring of the new system, if terms can be
agreed.

My favorite way of responding to the subject of 'too many postings' is to
delete the one's I am not interested in.  Plus people can backchannel if
they want to get really into a subject matter.  The choice should be up to
the writer of the post, but should also be aware that you are sending out a
post that is reaching ....? so many people.  Focus who you want to speak
to... if it is all, then send it.  If it is one person, just send it to
that one person.

Case solved!  Next case please!

I write a bit blindly into the list right now as I am on digest and thus
haven't seen the latest frontchanneling.

Public apology to Henry Gould for my joining in the public scapegoating.
Though heat is what you often get for posting, so when posting often, watch out.

I knew I'd get some lecturey backchanneling and here is what I'd like to
respond to from Mark Weiss:

> Then why not bring those discussions to the list? Unless you try and no one
>listens there's not much to complain about.

I have tried, just not recently.  Early summer, Gertrude Stein; later, Laura
Riding -- my asking seemed to spark a lot of conversation, which I listened
rather than added to.  And there were some others.

Maybe I am one of those you automatically delete.

Please don't send any more backchannel to lecture me!!!!  I'm a busy and
stubborn girl.

cheers to poetry

Subject:      nav.gaz. ethical query on new subject

listafarians: i write this query from, in my bleak moods, what i think
may be a naif manque position, and in my better moments, what i think
may be a majority, rationalist position.  could we kick this query
around pretty honestly -- i think the data would merit the perhaps
embarrassing self-exposure it may generate.

to set question up: a few months ago, poems for workshop type crit,
one of the members from an arena where i often participated in
workshop crit appeared to post in another area where i have some admin
say.  let's call this post K2.  K2 was a mocking poem, not
particularly great but ok.  suddenly appended to K2 was post saying
apparent signed poster was not, in fact, poster.

i'll spare you the thrasher details, but in my response to supposed
originator of K2, call person "K," i was apparently less than the ultimate
in clarity.  i got back in response an appallingly vitriolic little gem,
saying, among other things (and here is CRUX of matter) something like
"you are a mediocre, if that, poet and i always thought your critiques
were shallow and self-serving."

now, K had always been, if anything, almost syncophantic.  well, that
goes too far, but perhaps a bit uncritically admiring?  nothing
obvious, or excessive, just a faint sense.  good at taking a sharp
crit, almost invariably positive about my writing.  almost always at
least one, usually more good points of critique.  there had never been
anything to prepare me for vitriol.

i wrote back in shock, saying what on earth, and what has upset you, and
so forth.  nohting about "how could you denigrate my work" because i didn't
want to be a whiner.  well, again, cutting to chase, apparently my comments
on K2 post completely misunderstood to be critical, even, to suggest i was
the fake K2 poster.  when K got it all straight, wrote apology and said oh,
have always liked and respected your writing immensely and great crits etc.
type things.

HERE IS CRUX: i was almost nauseous.  i simply CANNOT imagine saying
either that i like someone's work when i don't, or, conversely, in
burst of pique saying i think they suck when i never did think so.  it
completely, utterly grossed me out.  i now have absolutely no trust in
K's opinion.  it was made worse by rumors sent me that apparently K
was/is very religious.  this hypcrisy from a purportedly RELIGIOUS
person?

i've tried to think, since.  sometimes, i've said, it is true, less sharp
things than i was thinking.  i've made some polite noises about work i am
less than wild about.  but never actually said anything like "your writing
is great" -- more, i'll find an image, or line, or if i can, single poem
i like and praise that.  and if asked, really asked, i'll be honest about
what i don't like.

there are writers i don't like, with work i DO like.  if i speak about
work, talk about work.  i always try, at least, to leave personal
opinion out of it.  that seems like most basic degree of respect about
writing one must have to really be able to do it well, or so i
thought.  there are people i've been angry at, jealous of, and it is
possible i don't accord their work the respect i should, or as fair a
reading as i should.  and when i think that could be the case, i try
to shut up about anything critical unless i'm really totally certain.
but i miss in this.

but have you, listmates, ever deliberately slammed work, publically or
privately, because you didn't like writer, or thought writer didn't like
your work and wanted to "get" them back?

have you, verifiably, seen this happen -- not suspected, but SEEN it
as i did in way that makes it unmistakable?

do you think this should be a basic ethical requirement we should make of
ourselves as critics?  i don't ask thses as straw questions.

for myself, i have this wierd feeling that if i lie, engage in this
kind of dishonesty (and i do lie, we all do, but i mean, lie in THIS
SPECIFIC WAY), it will pollute my writing.  it is maybe superstitious,
or voodoo, but at most rational level i can describe, seems like so
muc hof writing is instinct and deep truths, i.e. unmediated so as to
hold on to raw/edgy malleability and "artistry," that if you muck
around by dishonesties about writing, you risk losing your ability to
BE honest. and if you do that, you will lose your writing edge.  so,
in all honestly, it is perhaps selfishness that has made me toe this
line more than anything.  if i was assured that i could be dishonest
in this way and it wouldn't effect my writing, would i do it?  i think
i probably would not, that it is self-belittling to be untruthful,
beneath one.  but it is also possible i am completely blindsiding to
occurences of this in myself...

even as i write this, the glory of the poetics list is happening --
i'm hearing all of your voices already in response, and i can think of
lots of you trying to work out if you know of any dishonest critics
who are good writers to bring up as counters.  i can't think of any
just now, but i will work on it too.  K. is, by the way, not a great
writer.  ok, sometimes flat, sometimes cliched, sometimes overreaching
and not succeeding in project of poem.  but not in permanently, deeply
awful way.  more in way that suggests someone new to writing than
anything else, someone with work to do that they might, in fact,
actually be able to do at some point...

but meanwhile, do you engage in, or know of people who have engaged in
this kind of knowingly slanted crit?  would you allow someone you knew
to do it to write in zine/mag/journal you had control over? or do you
know it regularly to occur and automatically factor it in when reading
crit/ doing admin tasks involving assessment?

"I am developing a new collection here of Avant Writing, and you are one
of the people I have on my list to contact.  The collection is a kind of
outgrowth of the extensive archive of William Burroughs' papers that
were donated to this library (parts of which I have been cataloguing).
As Bob (Grumman) suggested, my budget for starting this is miniscule, so
I have indeed been asking people for donations of material.  So anything
of yours, and anything from your various publishing activities would be
most welcome indeed, and would be very much at the center of what I'm
trying to build here.  Basically I'm collecting innovative and
experimental work that is not to be found in most libraries, bookstores,
and this is generally ignorred by the established institutions, but that
I believe is the most important and exciting writing being done.  I am
convinced that this material will be recognized and valued for what it
is in the future, and this collection will provide a valuable resource
for future scholars and readers.  As will the collections of SUNY
Buffalo and Marvin & Ruth Sackner.

And yes, by all means, please add my name and address to your list of
archives.  You can add anything you think significant from the above as
a note, emphasizing that we are accepting donations of materials in the
areas of innovative and experimental writing and poetry, visual poetry,
audio poetry and related materials -  books, broadsides, ephemera,
serials, etc.

As a possible solution to the ongoing debate over how many posts one should
be allowed to post in a single day, I would like to suggest that anyone who
posts to this list be automatically unsubbed from it.

Well then, frontchannel. Twice issues raised and discussion provoked would
seem to indicate that the system now in place in fact works.

I think Elliza McGrand got it right: maybe on three or four occasions since
I've been on the list  I've had to wait till the next day for a post to
appear because the list was maxed out. Hardly a crisis.

As to the occasional eruptions of imbecility or unseemly passion, or the
times when the conversation ties itself into a knot, that's the nature of
communication. The britlist recently spent what seemed like a year (or was
it two weeks) angrily discussing an article that only one member had read
(and refused to quote apparently for fear of legal retribution--they still
use the stocks over there). So there were a lot of "If what you're implying
he said x, then y...," anwered by "actually it was more like z, but you
should really look at the article, which is unfortunately virtually
unavailable, as the ten copies printed floated down river with the
livestock in last week's flood" kinds of posts, all of them vehemently
passionate, many of them, given the lack of data, character assassination
by way of inuendo. The topic finally went away of its own accord, as would
have this one, spurred by Marjorie's initial post, which, having taken on
its own life, went some fairly interesting, if intemperate, places before
becoming lost in nothing but name-calling. In the past this little polity
has survived worse, and without any deus ex machina. Boredom and quiet
diplomacy seem potent enough.

Enough handwringing. Maybe what we need is public confessions--Fritz Perls
and Mao would have loved that.

On another topic: the word "assassination" implies that it helps to be
stoned when you pull the trigger. Is that also true of character
assassination?

Its surely a study in poetic consciousness to note how a thread which
originally started by asking the date the atom was split has turned into
missives from the chairman of the Free Henry Gould Committee.  Tho I
must admit that everytime I write one of these short posts now I feel
self-conscious (& those who know me, know that is an achievement) & have
this mental image of someone else out there unsubscribing because of
it.  Is this the hive mentality devolving into spitfire anarchy?

Pals and countrypeople,

Am I not allowed to back up Joel in his complaint???  Clearly he has
invested WORK in this list, and I wanted to publicly comment on his comments.

I don't want backchannel!!!  I don't want to post 3 times a day!@!  Perhaps
this is my last post ever, posthaste..

To clarify, I want people to be concise and thoughtful -- & respectful
maybe, I don't know, it tends to ease REAL COMMUNICATION!  I would love LOVE
to be on a list I felt more attuned to.  For one thing,(not to alienate any
dear pals or nothin) this list can feel very like an utterly male dominion,
I know I am not the only one who thinks so.  It also can feel like a
dysfunctional family.  Great. Two things I have been running from for years.
(not to gestalt ya, pls ignore except as an intellectual construct).

I don't want the list to function as a boredom-at-work easer for people.  Or
I don't want to be on a list that is. Do your work, go home, go for a walk,
whatever. Try a matinee!! Try a chatroom!! I would love the list to be for
announcements and thoughtful discussion.

Even as things stand --my definition of which is: there are sometimes things
that interest me being discussed, I have made new great contacts-- I am
thinking of dropping off the list. Why??  ***Witness what happened to Jen
Hofer when she mentioned gender-neutral pronouns.****  Why?? These back --
and later, in the digest, who knows what front- channel lectures from
everyone who somehow OWNS the list (or worse yet, poetry- or the entire
English language of he's and his's and for all mankind), and these will tend
to be -- less than charming

Well, its official. Mark Wallace's post shows that he has been living in
this city of bureaucrats too long.
But it did remind me of an incident from my distant past. When I was a
kid in Catholic grade school, we had a weekly discussion session with
one of the parish priests. Inevitably, one of the sessions dealt with
the so-called moral question, "If you were on a life raft that could
hold only six people and there were seven survivors who should make the
supreme sacrifice?" Because I was perpetually hungry, questions like
this irritated me. So I asked the priest, "What if one of the survivors
was a communist?" The priest, a gentleman of Polish descent, leaned over
an inch from my face and whispered, "Then drowning would be too good for
him."
I've suspected limits and boundaries ever since.

In the spirit of the long confessionals hereabouts of late...The following
suffers from a lack of facetiousness, which no doubt leaves its
earnestness open for ridicule: oh well, I 'll take my chances,
because I agree that Joel's posts call for more responses from us.  I hope
it will be clear that my rhetoric of anonymity is deliberate; I pretend to
speak for the list but am only speaking for myself, "myself" of course
being itself only a caricature.

Who is the list for? For its sponsors and its users (myself and
strangers), but not for everyone.

This much (or little) is granted easily enough.  But after all it's not so
easy as that.  Which I think means corollary and perhaps more interesting
questions should be asked, yet again.

What is this list for?  My generic answer is: To realize day in and day
out the notion that this technology can fulfill certain loosely defined
but specific goals and needs supposedly shared by sponsors and users
alike.  But this way of answering the question is perhaps not very helpful
after all.  And so: What is the list used for?  And thus: What do I use
the list for? Or: How do I use the list?

-To learn more about experimental poetry and poetics (list as ritual
space for the display of secrets to the uninitiated). I first heard about
the list from a new friend I made at an academic conference at Orono,
ME, so my decision to subscribe to this "community" (with at that time a
head count of about 300 and already considered by some overpopulated)
was based on an idealized description of it as a well-established venue
for the same exhilarating exchange of names, notices, ideas, and opinions
that I shared then face to face with other already subscribed listees.  I
am one of the horde of graduate students who have attached ourselves to
the list in the vain hope that we might learn more about poetry ignored
or dismissed at the schools to which we are also attached.  I sometimes
feel that this horde, which consists of individuals who are on some level
in economic competetion with each other (a not negligible claim that I
have intended to make before), doesn't have any real quickening effect on
the discussions, and may even have the reverse effect.  Hurrah for those
who do not believe that they have a precarious economic interest in what
goes on here and contribute out of other personal or political
motivations!

-To hear more about publications (list as bulletin board).  By far, most
of the postings that I have saved over the last two and a half years are
announcements about stuff that I can buy, read, view, attend, order,
covet, etc..

-To practice and perform an ethos (list as karaoke bar, cruising street,
or playground). I occasionally post throwaway verse constructed out of or in
response to discussion threads and intended as my contribution to the
anarchic polyphony that is so characteristic of this list.  The abject and
retrograde character of my satires on our own "jargon of tribal
intersubjectivity" (de Man) is fun for me to assume and infrequently
enough interjected to be harmless as far as I am concerned.  I very much
appreciate, for example, Alan Sondheim's "experiments in poetry" and
think that this list is a good place to find out how the poetics of satire
and enunciative position work when they are predicated on a new
medium of distribution.

I have tried to participate on the list at least once a month, in however
tangential or tentative way, because I think more users need to delurk in
order to actively shape this discourse community.  I also feel that I
would be exploitatively benefiting from the work of others if I did not
act to make the list work for them and me in accord with what I understand
to be the list's premises and purposes.  This is the onlysuch list that I
have subscribed to for the simple reasons that I only have so much time
for this sort of thing and I still believe this venue can provoke and
persuade me to articulate my own poetics, which are not identical with but
include that which I described above.  Several times, I have been dismayed
enough by the amount of what I consider blather and carelessness to unsub.
I haven't yet done so because: I still learn something now and then, I am
fascinated by the creative potential of this medium, and I am adept at
deleting the many posts that don't interest me and that make this list so
tantalizingly banal.

I was strongly encouraged to write a negative review for the Village Voice
a long time ago.  I resisted (my editor had something against the author);
my copy was badly affected; I didn't write any more reviews for VV.  On
the other hand, I once wrote a somewhat negative review of a friend's
book: I was and continue to be naive and driven.  My friend was absolutely
enraged: I had broken a serious code. I no longer review
professionally: for the most part, I found greater satisfaction in
publishing favorable reviews.  However, as I say, I am a strikingly naive
and lonesome dude: I know this is not the way the great world works.
And I still say we should all have to piss standing up.

the wealth of poetic knowledge and experience that this collection of 700
+/- list subscribers manifests is too great a treasure for it to be
diminished in any way.

i thrive on: closely argued disussions of issues in poetics; suggestions
and promotions of books and essays to read, small press publications and
journals to hunt down and read; compelling cases made for writers whose
work i might not otherwise check out; announcements of readings and
events, even in places i might have to make an effort to get to; reports
from readings and events that i would like to have attended but could not;
simple queries that generate broader discussions; and yes, even some
bickering (e.g. perloff-gudding, generational agon, etc).

i am enervated by: personal attacks, showboating, grandstanding, baiting,
running in-jokes, coffee-talk, idle banter as cure for work-a-day boredom,
coterie witticisms.  and nit-picky things like misdirected backchannels
(careful with that reply key eugene!), whole posts copied into subsequent
posts (if you don't know how to change yr email settings, find out!),
front-channel requests for the email addresses of people who as it turns
out are list subscribers (if you don't know how to review the list of
current subscribers, find out!), requests for information that has already
been posted (if you don't know how to search the list archives, find
out!).  (btw, "find out" = read welcome message or backchannel me!)

certainly not everyone shares my tastes, but at the risk of drifting into
can't-we-all-just-get-along, let's simply show some respect and
responsibility for ourselves and each other.

i suggest the following as a minimal standard for posting: will my post be
of interest and relevance to a majority of the 700 subscribers to this
list? (as corollary to the notion, stated in the welcome message, that
posting here is a form of publication)

((and hoping i havent herein violated my own dictum; poster's worst fear,
akin to kent's nobody likes me: am i one of those you auto-delete?))

another suggestion: perhaps those interested could put a rein on the
anarchy -vs- censorship debate by the backchannel drafting of some sort of
rules of the roost which could then be submitted for general approval?

A couple of weeks ago I got a note from a friend on the list (yes I still do
have some friends on the list) who asked me why the messages had stopped
coming. I quickly checked to see what the story was and I discovered the list
was locked because over 50 messages had been sent that day. I sent out a
message to free the locked posts, but I sent it to the list rather than
listserve. Thus my cryptic post of a couple of weeks back: Free Poetics. But
the response to that message made me aware that I had not been active
enough in
exercising the editorial functions of the list. My attention was simply
elsewhere, although I continued to read the list.

The Poetics List is by its nature limited and it can't reflect the desire of
all its participants, for as has been well articulated by others, the
direction
that some of the subscribers might wish to take the list will drive others
away
from it: *it has already has*. The alienation of many subscribers who for me
constitute a core constituency for us is an issue that those of involved in
maintaining the list are necessarily more concerned about than some list
participants. This has been an issue that has come up in this and every year
since the list was started in late 1993 and this is something like the reply I
have given in those earlier instances: I may well be mistaken about this, but
it has been a founding principal of the list and one I have stated more than
any other one except the centrality of announcements of readings and
publications for the list.

Indeed, in 1995, when the list had only 200 subscribers,  I made the point
this
way:
“I am interested in continuing to explore what formats and styles of posting
encourage, rather than simply allow,  participation in this ‘virtual
uncommunity’.  The volume of messages is certainly a useful measure of list
activity; but volume itself may be an obstacle for some to participate,
just as
it may encourage others.”

A year or two later I put it this way:
“The paradox is that in an attempt to be open and nonexcluding one can
end up excluding those who are unable to handle the volume: people are drowned
out rather than kept out  until Dreamworks Interactive, Inc., guides us and
we asphyxiate.”

In any case, I do not feel obliged to let those who post the most or are the
most belligerent in their posts determine the direction of the Poetics List.
However, I, along with my collaborators, are reading and considering any and
all suggestions we get frontchannel but also, significantly, backchannel.

I am making no claim as to what is right in all cases; I am rather asserting
the particular editorial parameters of this specific Internet project, and
indeed my own editorial judgment (in cooperation with those who share
responsibility with me for the list).  Others will surely want to create
different lists with different focuses and different limits, but it seemed to
me worthwhile at this time to try to reassert the values of the list to which
those of who organized it and maintain it are committed.

This is a private list. No one is required to participate, no one is
guaranteed
a right to participate. Its function, structure, and aims are determined by
its
editors. I believe in the value of editing and I believe this value does not
increase in the age of the Internet, but, if anything, increases. Editorial
decisions are open to question; they may be wrong or misguided. The lack of
editorial intervention is also a form of editing, subject to dispute.

This is and has always been a moderated list, albeit lightly moderated; the
very minimal intervention combined with maximum maintenance (thanks, Joel!) is
not to limit the range, anarchy, feistiness, good or bad manners of posts --
but rather to allow space for such exchanges to continue. The parameters of
this list does not include absolute right of anyone subscribing to it to send
out unlimited messages; indeed, one of the very few ground rules for the list
states just the opposite. I am very reluctant to express this in the number of
posts per day or even week, because back and forth at any given moment is one
of crucial features of the list. However, we ask that those participating in
this forum stick to a general sense of limit as measured, over longer periods
of time. When, in the judgment of those of working on the list, this limit has
been exceed , a polite message, emphasizing that the issue is volume of posts
not content, may be sent out; this should suffice for anyone wishing to
participate in the list. In the history of the list, I believe we have sent a
request to decrease the volume of posting to only four people among the
possibly 1000 who have subscribed at one time or another. When a subscriber
responds to such *multiple* requests by increasing the frequency of their
posting, then it is our obligation to recognize that the structure we have set
up is not working in this one instance and to act accordingly.

I want a Poetics List that I can read straight through, not the only the posts
I’m likely to like, but the one that annoy or irritate or surprise or baffle
me. I want a list where the folks subscribed don’t set their filters
(automatic
or manual) to delete posts from those people they feel have already heard
enough from (or otherwise use their delete button more than their view button)
. I may be the only one on this list who has attempted to read all the posts
that have been sent to it from the day the list was started. Maybe this makes
me a bad judge  maybe lists are condemned to cycles of always new readers who
stay on till they have had enough. But that’s not the kind of list I want.

Maybe I’m imposing reading values based on print journals or “real time”
conversation and dialogue onto a new and different medium. Maybe I’m just
holding onto an impossible ideal, against all odds, and against those who feel
that the instant gratification of being able to post not just a much as you
want (*which has never been limited*) but also as often as you want is a
fundamental value of the list. The Internet, we all know, offers much more
information that we can take in. I want a list that is not just another
example
of too much unfiltered, unconsidered product; that can be quiet, even silent,
some days, and noisy others  that doesn’t follow the imperative of the more
the
better, since the space is “free and unlimited”.

Electronic space is neither free or unlimited because our lives are neither
free or unlimited.

The economy of the list is affected by who posts more or less, what tones they
use, who is scared off and who is egged on, who has the time to read it and
write to it -- and who doesn’t and perhaps feels unable to post because never
able to get the end of the last series of posts before the topic has flown on
to something else. My temperament may indeed be contrary to this medium: I
seek
containment, a space I feel I can inhabit, that is slow as much as fast, kind
as much as unkind. A space I can think in and a space I want to go for
conversation. These expectations are unreasonable and perhaps that is the site
of the conflict here: for I want a list that articulates limits rather than
imposes them by volumetric default. And I want to bring this about by
self-reflective engagement of all those participating. This may not be the way
some of you see these issues, but I invite those interested to stick with
me in
this electronic experiment.

I don’t propose to stop the list or to change its structure. I propose to
stick
with it, pretty much as it has been these past several years. *No one has been
deleted from this list,* but those of us running the list reserve the right to
limit the number of posts that subscribers can send and, from time to time, to
make editorial comments on posts that have been sent.

Last night when I got home my son six-year old son Felix said to me, “I wish
everyone in the whole school lived in the same building”. Thinking of the
Poetics List, I can’t say I feel the same way. But I do wish we were all in
the
same conversation. I want to work for that, because I know it won’t be easy to
get there. It never has been.

I have included most of your post because I assume that many, like me, have
a hard time remembering what is being referred to, particularly in this
forum, where several discussions may be going on at once.
Part of what this list (I suppose any list) is is a community. Much of what
you don't like is a form of community bonding. That I can share a witticism
with someone I've never met and who, prior to my meeting them here, have
never read, is I think a good thing. That I am allowed into the intimacy of
a running joke, which is, by the way, an exemplary text (sorry, David,
George and Rachel, if that spoils some of your fun) is for me a privilege.
But there are always posts that I'll delete. Reports of readings I think
are fairly useless. I'm glad they're there for others who like them, and
I'm glad I don't have to read them.
I of course have no idea what's of interest to the 700 subscribers, and
pitching my posts with that in mind would render me mute more often than I
would like. I can try to be relevant to my own interests, just as I am in
work that I choose to publish, and hope that others may also be interested.
I know no other mechanism.
Here's a rule of courtesy I would like to see observed (I observe it
myself). Backchannelled messages should never be frontchannelled without
the original sender's permission. I often use backchannel for quiet
diplomacy or because I think that my message might be too incendiary if
sent to the entire list. I'm aware that a backchannelled message may be
seen as offensive or even harassing (I hope none of mine have been). If
that's the case the recipient, it seems to me, should in the first place
have recourse to Joel or Charles.

carlo, i just don't think it's that simple, man...

here charles has taken the time to situate his own motivations---his sense
of what the list is, how it works, what he'd like to see happen... he can't
be faulted for taking the time to state his opinions---though he *can*
always be faulted to the extent that, as the person who founded (and
provides some moderation for) the list, he invokes his (as he puts it)
editorship in ways that may conflict with what some "we" out here likes or
dislikes... and sure, charles's sense of the list is itself, as he
indicates, a function of what *he* likes and dislikes, and what he's
learned re such lists over time...

but the list, like that "we" two sentences back, is clearly neither
univocal, nor binary... based on the last few dozen statements from various
folks re what they like/don't like about the list (incl. you and me,
carlo), one might well conclude that there is NO consensus at all as to
what we should do re how this list runs... there is no consensus that it be
left entirely to its own devices, there is no consensus that it NOT be...
some of us (incl. me) have taken the rhetorical stance that it'd be better
if we exerted a bit more self-moderation (i won't spell this out again)...
some of us (like you, i'd say) are asking for a more vigorous, even
potentially agonistic exchange, in the belief that only with this measure
of "freedom" might we collectively attain something of lasting value (fair
gloss?)... and some of us don't understand why we're even bothering about
any of this... we all have our reasons, that is, which may be entirely
rational (or whatever)... but we all have our reasons...

let us assume the list functions out of some working dissensus, ok?...
then, how best to handle this?... "do nothing" is surely not the only, nor
is it necessarily the most democratic, response (if i believed this, i'd
hardly go for ANY form of govt.)... neither is "censorship"...

and note:   much of what we have at our disposal by way of gauging what IS
being done around here is the list history---which itself varies
considerably (some of us have been here for a month, some for a number of
years)---and our experiences with other such lists (which varies in the
obvious ways)...

again, like it or not, charles is free [cough] to take a stand here, and
it's clearly not one based on sheer "censorship," but on editorial
judgment---as he conceives it... whatever else, it's clear to yours truly,
anyway, that charles is not merely casting out of the poetix empire those
who fail to meet his arbitrarily-imposed parameters---though here again,
you are free [cough] to see things otherwise...

i wonder though:  are we really at such odds here, carlo?---or are we, both
of us in our ways, being teased by the seductive nature of this
medium---our words---to fall into such polarized quarters?...

alla that said:  though i'd no doubt turn the screw somewhat differently
than charles (b/c, for one, i'm not charles), i can only applaud his
persistence here... and in any case i find his willingness to engage with
us (an inclusive and dissenting us, mind you)---not in condescending terms,
either, but by being forthcoming about what he finds important, and
urgent---ample evidence that he's listening to what's being said...

best,

joe

 I'm not sure of the ground work.

She helped me move the boxes. And put the books on the shelf. It got to be late.
And she stayed. I didn't know he was returning. We weren't lovers, he and I,
anymore, but there were future possibilities. And we still loved. We all needed a
place to sleep. We could all save face.

"Because there is this unfinishing that partitions our being in common, there is
'literature', that indefinitely repeated suspended gesture of touching the limit,
indicating and inscribing it but without crossing it or abolishing it in the
fiction of a common body. To write for others means in reality to write because of
others. The writer gives nothing and destines nothing to others; the project she
has in view is not to communicate anything whatsoever, neither a message or
herself. To be sure, there are always messages and persons, and it is important
that both (treating them, if I can, as identical for the moment) to be
communicated. But writing is the necessity of exposing the limit--not the limit of
communication, but the limit on which communication takes place." Jean-Luc Nancy,
"Of Being-in-Common", _Community at Loose Ends_.

Difficult, when the bus is full (H4 line before 9 AM) to scribble. To send
messages. But we are shoulder-to-shoulder. "Please move all the way back." "Pull
to signal driver to stop".

I think that the difficulties of any sort of poetics that involve things like dhtml or javascript or, really, any high-tech--and Alan Sondheim, Bob Haynes, and
Bill Marsh have alluded to difficulties here--is to bring it home. Though this is also a general challenge in writing anything. To bring it home isn't to get
lost in the technicalities of scripting, sort of like a creative writing approach that talks about line breaks and technique interminably. Though it is
interesting to consider a criticism that can at once talk about the neath text in an engaging way while also finding ways to talk about totally non-technical
dimensions of new media. Ideally, we develop a critical language that can lite through all the dimensions of the work and the frame and the other frames without
getting bogged down in technicalities. That's what I'd like, anyway, and that's what I'm working toward in ditties like Infoanimism and even Enigma n.

I appreciate the opportunity to talk about these things here among writers with a real interest in these things, Alan, Bob, Bill, all.

Which brings me to my own two bits worth on the 'posting scandal'. Anyone who's ever organized poetry readings for a while or probably any public arty forum
eventually seems to suffer the old phenomenon of the trickster insurrection and accusation. Lordy it's a bore the fifth time around. It's a bore and it's
annoying because the important issue of freedom of speech is trivialized by the trickster who turns it into a childish sideshow for the sake of getting
attention, nothing more.

Does anyone know of any English translations of novels by Louis-Rene Des
Forets? If so, what is your impression of their quality?

Subject:      moderation, posting, etc.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I hesitated about writing this post because I knew it would be a long one.
For about five years, I've moderated or co-moderated a number of email
lists, including Cybermind which has heavy posting at times; we reached an
all-time high a couple of years ago at 117. We've also been trolled,
hacked, and otherwise targeted by people wanting to bring down the list.
Given that, I'm happy to see Poetics, in fact, so healthy. And every list
goes through self-reflection; every list has in-groups, frequent posters -
and lurkers, etc.

First point - when Michael Current and I started Cybermind, we thought of
a list as a privilege - that subscribers are privileged to be on it - that
it shouldn't ever be taken for granted. Even if the moderator does very
little in terms of focusing, there is no reason whatsoever to assume that
you have a _right_ to be on a list.

Why? Because a list is always running on free labor - on the labor of the
sysadmins, the software designers (who are usually updating), and so
forth. And especially the labor of the moderator. Don't _ever_ take this
for granted; while at this point, my lists pretty much run themselves,
there have been times (and will be more) when I've had to work hours and
hours a day to keep them going. These times include heavy periods of
subbing and unsubbing and requests regarding both; advertising the list
whenever a change is made; searching for and augmenting a new 'home' for
the list (Cybermind has moved three times); dealing with error messages -
which can be nothing, or extremely bothersome if a loop's set up (one day
I was on 16 hours taking care of that) feeding forward exponentially into
people's mailboxes; dealing with problems of focus and other content
issues; dealing with groups who deliberately try to troll or otherwise
derail a list; and backchanneling constantly to keep things going smooth-
ly.

This is all done freely, by me, and I assume by Charles, and by others who
are running lists. And there _never_ is an answer to questions of focus,
on-topic, off-topic, etc. that makes sense. Right now, I'm working with
several people, starting a focused semi-moderated list dealing with cyber-
culture, because Cybermind has become an entrenched community (which I do
not mean as a criticism). I notice Poetics is becoming the same, and that
worries me.

What's the problem? That there are hundreds and hundreds on this listserv,
and yet the number of high-volume posters is very limited. These posters
know each other; they reference each other by first name, tell in-jokes
about each other, create false and sometimes real squabbles and faux
texts, and so forth. While this givesa sense of community, it is also very
exclusionary; I understand in fact that there _is_ another list that has
split from Poetics perhaps because of this.

We all want to be supportive of each other. Anyone working in the arts
(however you want to define it) is under attack. Almost no one can support
her- or himself. The statistics given in _Information on Artists, A study
of artists' work-related human and social service needs in four U.S. loca-
tions,_ written by Joan Jeffri and published by the Research Center for
Arts and Culture at Columbia, are pathetic. In 1996, almost half NY
artists (47.6%) earned less than $3000 from their work. So what is the
point here?

That one way support occurs is through community formation. But commun-
ity formation can also be organized around limited spoils - who gets
grants, who doesn't, who's invited in the _other_ list, who isn't. The
same community that's supportive is also exclusionary. The same devices on
an email list that are supportive - first name and reminiscence for
example - also create a feeling among others (including myself for that
matter) that they're looking in through a window, which can't help, by the
very terms and intensity and firewalling of that window, be a sign of
privilege.

I don't honestly know what to do about this; other lists have the same
symptoms, the same debates, the same trajectories - even the same splits
into other lists (Future Culture and Fop-l and Phil-Lit all have had their
splits). The splits sadden me, since they're more divisive than the on-
list behaviors they critique by their very removal.

Now, Poetics is admirable. There are a high number of female posters -
which you might take for granted, but this is by no means always the case.
Flames here are like embers elsewhere; they're not particularly igniting.
And the discussions are usually, almost always, focused - even these
recent discussions are focused.

So what I would like to see, is, first, no quota for a person, but the 50
a day is reasonable (I think Cyb is currently set up with the same).
Second, sensitivity to in-group/out-group behaviors - if you're _really_
writing something, say, to Peter Holiday, do you need the whole list to
see it? While the writing might be great, etc., it does all too often
create an image of eclusion. Third, advertising books and magazines etc.
are terrific here and necessary - where else? Small press distribution has
a hard enough time. Fourth, perhaps there should also be a few more calls
for papers and conference announcements. Sixth, try and bring others into
the discussion through open-ended questioning at times. This may seem ab-
surd and unnecessary, but again, all lists follow these trajectories, and
it would be great if we could slightly switch off here.

And seventh, even though this is a private list, I don't think it would be
a bad idea to actively try and bring new writers - who would benefit of
course - onto it. At 660 or so, it's not _that_ private; Cyb's been around
only 350 and we're completely public, listed all over the place.

Finally, I think calls from the moderator shouldn't be easily dismissed;
he or she has spent _a lot_ of time working on the list, overseeing it,
reading most of the posts, and so forth. He or she also gets sub/unsub
notices constantly, so it's easy to keep track of the overall trajectory
of the list; when discussion on Cybermind gets nasty, the unsubs come in
pretty quickly. So by all means give her or him the benefit of the doubt
here - for us, Poetics is a space of discussion or presentation or dis-
tribution - but we're not as aware of the full architecture as the mod-
erator.

I'm not calling, btw, for a bow-down to authority or anything of that
sort. Nor am I saying moderators are always right; there was a time I
really blew it badly on Fop-l. But I am asking for a possibly more open
and accommodating list than has been indicated in the recent past (of
course from the viewpoint of the dinosaurs, all past is recent here).

Anyway, elsewhere I've lectured myself hoarse on issues of list gover-
nance, and it's no wonder that so many moderators go, literally, crazy.
But that's another topic and elsewhere.

I went to the Lipstick Eleven Party tonight, a frosty night in SF, and the
readings were wonderful.  The half of this event I heard was superb.  The
scene from Kevin Killian's and Wayne Smith's "Diamonds and Rust" had the
audience laughing.  Dodie Bellamy of Small Press Traffic, Norma Cole (also
Isabella Rossellini in "Diamonds and Rust"), Robert Gluck, and Robin Tremblay-
McGaw read fresh, engaging pieces.  And the raffled prizes were very pink and
splendid.

I heard about the reading here!  Cheers, Carmen

in the Creeley interview in the Cortland Review:
Who are some of the up and coming writers that interest you? Or are there any?

     There are always far more than anyone as myself can keep track of or
even recognize. The old are hardly the best judges for the young. "The old
order changeth yielding place to new..." Hardly a new recognition. I
remember Pound saying years ago that, after fifty, one can't keep ones eye
on all the sprouting corn. After seventy it's hard enough even to see it. I
think quickly of two young writers who interest me and always have:
Jennifer Moxley, Vincent Katz. Susan Howe (who I have to remember is not
young!) interests me always. Alice Notley, Leslie Scalapino. To you they
might seem already too settled. But some writers, as Robert Grenier, are
never so "done" as that presumes. They are always at work, on the way.
Writers as Duncan McNaughton still wait for a defining audience.

what do you think he means by "a defining audience"

Like everyone else I am sick of the meta-list talk and am anxious to get
back to talking about poetry (if that's really what the list is for.) I
thought I would pose a questions since many have said it would benefit the
list if more people asked open-ended questions. I am a poet, not an
academic or scholar so if my question seems clunky so be it.
        Lately I have been reading Rachel Blau DuPlessis's brilliant and
haunting _Drafts 15-XXX, The Fold_,. In it, the image of text erased comes
up. This image is also frequent in Michael Palmer and many
other contemporary poets as well as visual artists. (Though I can't think
of the names of any visual artists at the times, my head is full of images
of text erased, blocked or blurred.) O.K. so my question, what is it about
the decade we are in that makes this image resonate with us now. I guess
the easy answer is that language poets and conceptual arts are interested
in the philosophical issues that surround the question of "what is a text?"
but I wonder if there might be more to it. In the sixties, poets were
drawn to images of stones and bones partly because they may have been
reading Jung-- but I think there were larger forces at work. The retreat
into basic archetypal imagery was a response to the violence of the era.
I think this argument is from _The Psyco-Sexual Muse_-- is that the book's
title? I don't think I read it but I remember when it came out.) Anyway,I
am searching for a sort of cultural answer and maybe it doesn't exist--
but I would be interested in what people think. If a cultural answer isn't
appropriate, why not?

I don't know if they are still in print, but you may be able to get them
through a University Library:

Des Forets, Louis-Rene. _The beggars. _( D. Dobson, London, 1948) (
Translation of Les mendiants.)

                                                _The children's room. _
(Calder, London 1963)
 Translation of La chambre des enfants. (Includes The bavard.--The
children's room.--The great moments of a singer.)

The latter would be a great find as it contains the core works (I think The
Bavard is his best fiction) -- though I don't know how good the translation
is, never having read it. Des Forets is a wonderful writer -- I guess he is
getting somewhat better known here now because of Blanchot's renown.

I have just been reading John Lennard's _But I Digress: The Exploitation
of the Parentheses in Printed English Verse_ (Clarendon [Oxford], 1991)
and want to wholeheartedly recommend this very strange, clear, captivating
book and its treatment of the history and dramas of the parentheses,
including perforce a running history of English print and publication (Tom
Beard, you might get a kick out of this [thank you by the way for yr
recent post re type-face]).  I have just reached 1680-1780 when type-face,
grammar, syntax, style become less confused, less messy, clearer, giving
over to a kind of Rationalization of The Page.  At this time too a great
denigration of Rhetorick.

Finally I want to recommend the reading of this List. It is a great read,
including even its ructions.  I read every post and no I do not have much
leisure time no, being a guy barely 30 with a tiny baby, responsiBILities
and who must wake at 4 am each day just to find time to write poetry
before baby Clio wakes up, YES I recommend this list: it is indeed a great
read, ructions and all. The Lord bless this list and its boinky of bounty!
God bless the lurkers too; let them lurk if they want; God bless the
blabbermouths too, whoever they are.

I think that the List is an unprecedented resource for poetry. The fact that
666 people subscribe to it speaks eloquently enough for us all.

I'm sympathetic with the problems of stewardship that Charles and Joel have
shouldered in making possible such an amazing project. Anyone who has ever
spent time checking out the poetry usenet groups knows what a totally
unedited, public resource might look like. By placing the most modest
conception of "private" around the space, the List has managed to become
something very different indeed. The problem is how to keep that conception
modest indeed.

So I'm also sympathetic to the perspective faced by Henry Gould and my
personal vote here is to bring the man back. If Henry represents the extreme
example, it's not all that different from what a lot of us on the list do
and have done. My own sense is that the only good reason to 86 someone from
the list is if the person uses it to make violent, threatening or
maliciously false statements. Talking too much even with a keyboard may be
obnoxious, but it's not on the same order.

I think that the list works best when we self-govern it, which means
self-governing ourselves and our own behavior.

Lets look at how the list really works. In the month of November, 1998,
there were 984 messages posted by 215 different people. The EPC archive for
that month lists 219 posters, but 5 of them appear to have been Henry
(including once as Eric Blarnes). At 50 messages per day for a 30 day month,
November had a capacity for 1,500 messages. That means that we left fully
one-third of the potential space unused. 516 messages that never got written
and sent.

215 posters means that 451 lurkers chose not to send a single message. Sixty
four people sent only a single message. So 151 people chose to send more
than one. On average, people posted 4.5 messages for the month. (And, 451
"silent lurkers" could have each posted once and we still would have had
room for another 65 messages, two per day for the entire month.)

23 of us, myself included, more than doubled the average of posts made by
active users. In fact, these 23 people accounted for 437 messages, 44% of
the entire months conversation. We all know who we are, but for the record,
here by number of November posts (Henry's five groups bundled into one
total), are the heaviest users:

Henry Gould  39
Gabriel Gudding    34
Kent Johnson    32
Mark Weiss    29
Jonathon Mayhew    29
A. Jenn Sondheim 25
David Bromige  24
miekal and    21
Joe Amato/Kass Fleisher    20
Eliza McGrand    19
Mairead Byrne    17
Mark Prejsnar    17
Mark DuCharme    14
Michael Magee    14
Aldon Nielsen    13
Dale Smith    13
Patrick Pritchett    12
George Bowering    12
Judy Roitman    11
Kathy Lou Schultz    11
Ron Silliman    11
Maria Damon    10
Todd Baron /*/ ReMap    10

Seven folks count for more than 20 percent of the month's messages, but in
fact, Henry's not so far above Gabriel and Kent. What I see here is a
continuum of use. There is no magic number below which usage drops suddenly.
Unless it's the benchmark between one and zero.

My question is -- is this a problem if in fact a third of the list's
potential capacity remains unused? Not so very much of one, I think.

I do think -- I've said this before -- that it makes sense to stop and think
before posting more than two times on a given day. But even Henry has an
average of under 1.3 posts per day.

When people do post more than once per day, there is usually a reason, more
specifically some thread, whether it's one of high theoretical seriousness
or the sort of banter that George, Eliza and David treat us to (without
which this list would lose a lot of its personality, frankly). In fact, an
absolutely equal distribution of posts among users would mean just 2.2
messages per month, which would make the list more or less incoherent I
suspect, since threads would be almost impossible and we would be reduced to
listing readings, books, etc. (there may someday be need for such a list,
but we haven't gotten there yet).

What this leads me to conclude is that we should -- each of us -- be our own
personal editor (doing the police, literally, in different voices). I'm not
convinced that we need any heavier hand at this point, although I think
discussions like this one are worthwhile to keep us mindful of the list's
realities, limitations and needs.

Finally, one aside, on the nature of my own three addresses: one
(ron.silliman@gte.net) is for a digest version of the list; a second
(tottels@hotmail.com) is to get messages "in real time," which allows me on
a slow day to read what's been going on from the office. [I often just read
the digest and then go back and delete everything from the "real time"
version, which means that personal messages sent to that address run some
risk of never being read.] The third account (netcom) is an old email
account that I've been unable to get Joel to remove from the list. I don't
have access to it anymore and can't self-unsubscribe from that address. But
I tried getting Joel to do it for me when he was attempting to manage the
list without benefit of either a permanent email address himself or even a
steady home. (Talk about herculean dedication to the list!)  Maybe now  that
account can go away.

Janet Lewis, an internationally known poet, novelist and opera librettist=
,
has died at her Los Altos home. She was 99.

The widow of the poet and critic Yvor Winters, who died in 1968, Miss Lew=
is
lived to see her fame outweigh his, thanks to her authorship of ``The Wif=
e
of Martin Guerre,'' a novel about 16th century France, which was adapted =
for
opera, screen and musical stage productions.

She was born in Chicago and grew up in Oak Park, Ill., a contemporary of
Ernest Hemingway, and contributed to the same high school magazine as he.

She graduated from the University of Chicago, with a major in French. Whi=
le
there, she met Mr. Winters, whom she married in 1926 and accompanied to
California.

At first, she preferred poetry as a medium, publishing several books,
beginning with ``The Indians in the Woods'' in 1922.

Later, however, she concentrated on fiction, authoring ``The Invasion,'' =
an
account of the interplay between white and Indian culture on the frontier=
,
published in 1932.

She is best known for three short novels on historical themes. The first,
``The Wife of Martin Guerre,'' was written in Los Altos and finished in
1937.

It was issued in a hand-printed edition in 1941, by The Colt Press, a
distinguished enterprise run by writer and book designer Jane Grabhorn, a=
nd
supported by businessman William Matson Roth.

The book was reissued in 1959 by The Swallow Press and has remained in pr=
int
ever since.

``Guerre,'' told from a woman's viewpoint, deals with a man who poses as
another, and whose identity must be resolved by a trial. The story was
presented in opera form, with music by Bay Area composer William Bergsma,=
 in
1961.

That work was praised by music critic Richard F. Goldman, of the Music
Quarterly, as ``the best American opera I have heard.''

In 1984, a French film version, ``The Return of Martin Guerre'' was relea=
sed
with Gerard Depardieu. It was remade as an American film set in the Civil
War, ``Sommersby,'' released in 1993 with Jodie Foster and Richard Gere.

Of Miss Lewis's remaining short historical novels, ``The Trial of Soren
Qvist'' appeared in 1947, and ``The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron'' in 1959.

The three short novels were based on actual incidents. In addition,
``Against A Darkening Sky,'' a novel based on the 1933 kidnapping of a
department store heir in San Jose, and the lynching of his accused
abductors, was published in 1943 and reprinted in 1985.

During the 1960s, Miss Lewis taught in the creative writing department at
Stanford. Her writing attracted even greater attention with the rise of t=
he
feminist movement.

She also published several volumes of stories and other poetry collection=
s,
including ``Poems Old and New: 1918-1978.''

In a comment with which many authors would agree, she told an interviewer=
 in
1996, ``The exciting moments come when you're writing. They disappear so
fast.''

She is survived by a daughter, Joanna Thomson of Madison, Wis., and a son=
,
Daniel Winters of Davis. No service has been announced.

the relevant work of scholarship on the issue of "whither the list" is
Albert O. Hirschman, EXIT, VOICE AND LOYALTY, written in the 1960s.  I
recommend it to all.

just to say, some great stuff there from alan s and ron s... along with
'why i'm on this list' posts (like eliza's and others') it helps in
fleshing out the list function entire...

perhaps, then, this sort of house-cleaning/reflexive air-play is a
necessary part of keeping such places alive?...

do not respond to this post as it constitutes 1/50 of the days

i am conducting an analysis of the poetics list subscribers settings and
the last part of it (to double check) requires that I post something to
the list to get an acknowledgement

I will send a message in a few minutes explaining what I have
discovered. (in partial reply to Ron's stats)

I for one am two and as two I am too.  Eliza writes of her anxiety dream and I
have had that dream too.   And this is an account of a true event and it is
very interesting.
I for one have been lurking and I have been lurking for a year.  Since then
and since then I have been lurking and now I'm not lurking to make Ron's list
and I will have fame and not as much as she and not as much as Gertrude Stein.
And I for one have been erased and my lurking has been my erasing before I was
even written.

I'm a little embarrassed to have 29 posts in November. I'm going to slow
down.  The 1st couple months I was subscribed I was very slow to post, and
anxious about the response of y'all. As a gradually gained confidence
about what I had to say, my monthly totals crept up. It takes incredible
ego to think that what I have to say will be of interest to hundreds of
people, only about a dozen or so I have met face to face.  But when I saw
so many "throw away messages" I said "why not?" As an experiment I
refrained from posting for a few days--to see the effect of my absence.
The conversation turned to the nomenclature of Mars bars in England,
Canada, and the US. Yet it might have easily taken a more scintillating
turn...

this is only half of the story, Id like to see word count & see how the

exchange for a free lifetime sub to the list.

one things that occurs to me & only one since alan, charles & ron have
done a remarkable job of stroking the fire without smouldering it, is
commeraderie, private sub lists, conspiracies & reconfigurations of the
electronic space is how the electronic wilderness sustains itself. the
more edges the more diversity.  one evolution of the list that hasnt
been discussed is it feels its time for real life poetics list
gatherings/festivals, gatherings that would have the breadth that the
list has achieved, a gathering where visual, sound, performance, & plain
old poets who write words in lines could meet for several days & maybe
shake up the patterns that have developed & do real work as well --
this is the same conclusion that the mailart network came to in the
middle 80s, 1000s of people had mixed it up in the mail & it was time to
meet face to face & invoke alliances of personality, taste & attraction
that werent possible from simply exchanging art via mail.  just an idea,
the logistics of such gatherings would be daunting.


I too would like to return to the regularly scheduled broadcasts & am
scheming of initiating a project on the list, that could occupy a narrow
band of this broadcast.  Im interesting in collectively creating a
poetics of the hypertext that would withstand the enslaught of the many
invigorated minds & styles --  & to create such a dialogue / reading
thru as a hypertext.  To do this everything posted to this discussion
would have to useable on a website other than the archives.  Much of the
hypertext & its discussion is quite bland & unremarkable & it would be a
significant contribution to the field as a whole is we (or at least the
fabulous & verbose 20) could take a stab at changing the static & 3
dimensional way hypertext thought seems to be evolving.

Also that in the course of life, there are moments & times when words reveal
themselves as elusive, illusory--in the most serious, least serious, most tragic,
most joyous times--when life is so much *stronger* than any words that could be
appended.

For example, we grow facile with words and then someone close dies--and we get
first row visions of silence and disbelief and time-going-on. And all the words
that could explain fall away.

I admire those who try to write into these voids (Harold Brodkey's _This Wild
Darkness_ comes to mind, or the late work of Herve Guibert).

I always feel like a prehistoric creature in the face of extreme events. I realize
how late language came to our biologies.

Dear poets, poeticists, poetasters, taskers, and criticks-


my last post was sent simply to generate this following message:

Your message  dated Sat,  05 Dec 1998  08:50:19 -0500  with subject
"test--please delete--do not respond to this" has been successfully
distributed to the POETICS list (452 recipients).

That 452 recipients is pretty consistent with the numbers that I gathered
through looking at the list of subscribers and their settings. This means that
about 214 or so people are set to NOMAIL. After looking at this list of people
set to NOMAIL, I am pretty sure that many of them are not coming back. Some of
them are either dead, moved on to new academic institutions, new ISPs, or
whatever. There are many duplicates, as has been pointed out. Of the people
who were set to NOMAIL, I noticed probably a dozen or so (at most) who were or
have been, and probably will be, active members (readers &/or contributors) to
the list. Of the rest, many of them have never posted, as far as I can tell.
If you send the following command

REVIEW poetics

in a one-line message to the listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu  address you will
see that there are 666 (+/-) people listed. Three are concealed, and one of
the concealed is (oddly) also set to NOMAIL.

Perhaps there is some sense of "who's who" that makes people who aren't
interested in participating keep their names in the  coolio hipster poetics
list register. Anyone on the list who needs to find Jena Osman, say, or
whomever, can find that person without much difficulty. So I do think that
there is some functionality to being set NOMAIL.

Of the remaining 450 or so people who receive poetics list posts, currently
about 200 (with a 1% margin of error) are set to digest. This means they
receive all of the messages as one message at 12:00am ET. This leaves about
250 or so participants reading these messgaes one at a time. Because it is
much more difficult to reply from the digest mode to a particular issue, the
greatest amount of participation comes from these 250 who are regular
subscribers to the p-list. Very few digest members of this list ever write in
to the list and it seems to be one step from NOMAIL in the sense that the
amount of effort to delete what has been at times a several hundred page
document (each day's digested message) is about the same as it is cancel a
transaction at the ATM.

in response to Ron, who says:

"215 posters means that 451 lurkers chose not to send a single message. Sixty
four people sent only a single message. So 151 people chose to send more
than one. On average, people posted 4.5 messages for the month. (And, 451
"silent lurkers" could have each posted once and we still would have had
room for another 65 messages, two per day for the entire month.)"

If we chop off 200 hundred for NOMAIL and maybe estimate that less than half
(?) of the digest people are actually reading these messages (though I would
suspect that it is much lower) then lets say that there are approximately
150-200 lurkers

The problem here, Ron, is that growth of replies out of a source post is
exponential. I would bet that if 50 or so people who don't write in to this
list, but who are regular readers of it, were to START posting something,
there would be a wildfire of response multiplying the top people on your list
into numbers that would ruin your "still room left under our tent" theory.

perhaps I am wrong, maybe they would all be ignored....

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

From this morning's NY Times (The composer of the Martin Guerre opera was
Bergsma, not Bergsman):

 Janet Lewis, 99, Poet of Spirit and Keeper of the Hearth, Dies

          By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

Her first writings to reach print ran shoulder to shoulder with Ernest
Hemingway's. For her first published poetry she was grouped with William
Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore. She made it to Paris ahead of both
Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a leader of the University of
Chicago school of imagist poets, and if hers is not a household name, by
the time she died on Monday at the age of 99 in the house in Los Altos,
Calif., she had occupied for two-thirds of a century, Janet Lewis had the
satisfaction of knowing she had written poetry throughout the 20th century
and seen it published and praised in every decade since the first.

Her reputation has seemingly been eclipsed by that of her late husband,
Yvor Winters, the poet, professor and critic who wrestled Hart Crane's
"Bridge" into print and made Stanford -- and Los Altos -- a magnet for
three generations of poets. Yet there are many who will assure you that
when the literary history of the second millennium is written at the end of
the third, in the category of dazzling American short fiction her "Wife of
Martin Guerre" will be regarded as the 20th century's "Billy Budd" and
Janet Lewis will be ranked with Herman Melville. (Though, to be fair, her
prose is more often likened to Stendahl's.)

What makes her accomplishments even more impressive is that over the course
of a a career in which she wrote hundreds of poems, a single collection of
short stories, a couple of children's books, a handful of novels, the words
to five operas and one acclaimed masterpiece, Miss Lewis pursued a literary
life in which the focus was on the life and the life was one of such placid
equilibrium and domestic bliss that she had to reach deep down in her
psyche -- and far back in the annals of criminal law -- to find the
wellspring of tension that produced some of the 20th century's most vividly
imagined and finely wrought literature.

She also had to find the time.

As she once observed, women of prodigious literary output, like Willa
Cather and Edith Wharton, tended not to have children. As the mother of
two, Miss Lewis willingly put her work aside when her children were young
and cheerfully accepted other duties as well. "It's a question of what you
want to do with your life," she once said. "You might also want to take
care of your husband."

The daughter of a poetry-spouting English professor, Miss Lewis was born in
Chicago and grew up in Oak Park where she and her 1899 contemporary, Ernest
Hemingway, contributed their first works to the same high school literary
magazines, she deriving inspiration by summering even deeper in the north
woods than he and finding a lifelong fascination with nature and the
natural flow of life.

Her sentiments were expressed in a 1922 poetry collection, "The Indians in
the Woods," in a series of stories later included in a 1946 collection,
"Good-Bye, Son and Other Stories," and in a 1932 narrative, as she called
it, "The Invasion," the multi-generational account of a Scotch-Irish-Indian
family.

After two years at a junior college, Miss Lewis completed her education at
the University of Chicago, majoring in French while joining the famous
Poetry Club and meeting Mr. Winters, who had spent time at a tuberculosis
sanitarium in Santa Fe, N.M.

After a brief stay in Paris after graduation in 1920, Miss Lewis returned
to Chicago but soon contracted tuberculosis herself and spent five years at
the same sanitarium, engaging in a passionate correspondence with Mr.
Winters and eventually marrying him and following him to California, where
she threw herself into a satisfying domestic life that included tending to
her husband's registered Airedales, harvesting the fruit from the adjacent
orchard and serving as a sort of serene den mother to an extended, animated
family of her husband's awed acolytes.

One of the first and by far the fiercest and most controversial of the New
Critics and a man of cocksure opinions, for all his fabled influence on
20th century American poetry, Mr. Winters may have made his greatest
contribution to literature when his wife, whose life was virtually without
drama, complained that she had trouble finding suitable plots and he gave
her a chance copy of a 19th-century compilation of famous old legal cases.

By the time she had finished it, Miss Lewis had all but abandoned poetry
and embarked on what turned out to be three short historical novels, "The
Wife of Martin Guerre" (1941), "The Trial of Soren Qvist" (1947) and "The
Ghost of Monsieur Scarron" (1959), all based on actual cases and so
compellingly imagined and told that she inspired the 1956 "Wife of Martin
Guerre" opera by William Bergsman, who asked her to write the libretto. The
composer Alva Henderson was so impressed he got her to write the libretto
for his 1976 opera, "The Last of the Mohicans," and two others.

The historical novels, Miss Lewis said later, represented the "heavy
thinking" of a literary career that did not include her poetry. Her poems,
she said, were always personal, a quiet corner of her life.

Devastated by her husband's death in 1968, Miss Lewis, who never took his
name off the mailbox and maintained his writing shed as a shrine, sought to
deal with her grief by revisiting the Southwest, rediscovering her
fascination with the local Indians and producing a series of memorable
poems.

For Miss Lewis, who is survived by a daughter, Joanna Thomson of Madison,
Wis.; a son, Daniel Winters of Davis, Calif., and three grandchildren, her
family was always more important than her work, and her life is well
reflected in her final collection, "The Dear Past," (1994) with poems
covering most of the century.

Under the influence of her husband, she had done her share of
experimenting, but the woman who had begun her career by taking part in the
imagist revolution that sought to strip poetry of its former artifice,
ended it the same way, using spare, lyrical language to describe and
celebrate the simplest scenes of nature.

For a woman who charmed generations of troubled poets  and other literary
figures with her almost otherworldly serenity, looking back over the
domestic scenes of a long, literary life it would be hard to find a more
compelling image of Miss Lewis -- or one more evocative of the
flesh-and-blood life beneath the surface of 20th-century literature -- than
one of the many at the family's house after a warm, rollicking meal with
the couple's dearest friends.

You may have to close your eyes to conjure up the sight, but there they are
forever, two 1899 contemporaries standing side by side at the kitchen sink,
Janet Lewis washing, Vladimir Nabokov drying.

Ok, flexible (or maybe just wishy-washy) fellow that I am, I'm now
abandoning my advocacy of the two-post per day platform (since it's never
going to happen anyway), and am now all in favor of the virtues of
self-moderation.  This is what I wanted all along anyway (as I said)--I
had just begun to wonder if it could really happen.  Now I've decided to
be, once again, infused with optimism about this possibility.  But I did
want to mention something that seems to me to be missed by Ron's analysis
of "how the list really works," and by those others before him who pointed
out that the ceiling of 50 posts per day is most often not reached.   It
seems, to me at least, that there is something enervating* about reading
multiple postings from the same people, day after day, especially if there
seems little in the way of rewarding content in those posts.  This
"enervation effect," I would argue, has an unfortunate effect on the
vitality of the list, and this effect occurs *even if the day's limit is
not literally exceeded*.  One's list-appetite can be surfeited on this
sort of diet long before that limit is actually reached.


*enervate--Tom Orange has already used this word in relation to list
dynamics, and it seems to me peculiarly applicable.  "To deprive of nerve,
force or strength; to weaken physically, mentally, or morally; to render
feeble."  The word also, to me, has a pleasingly fin de siecle ring about
it.  I predict a new vogue for it as the cyberage approaches the
millennium.

herb, thanx... geezus, what a story!...  and i have to say, i don't think
i've ever read a word by janet lewis...

so i guess i have to add her to my ever-growing list...

&

well now that miekal has posted to the list something i've felt should
happen for a good while now, i'll 2nd the motion:  i too think we should
have an f2f conference, derived somehow from (owing somehow to?) this
list... how i'm not sure, but it's all open to discussion... perhaps
"conference" isn't the right word either---perhaps a gathering of the
tribes would be more apropos... or a festival, or a garden party, or-----

of course not just logistics and money are involved... TIME would be
involved, somebody's time in particular... so what, now, do we ask charles
to put this together for us?... again, is this up to charles (and joel, et
al.)?... i can only help out (i think) via this box here mself...

so what, now?...

If we could get rid of the 4 or 5 female posters in the top 23, that might
be a start. I have noticed that females sometimes tend to write many short
posts rather than a single long "rewarding" posts. This definitely saps
the masculinity, I mean the vitality, of the list.  I know there aren't
that many women piping up but guys like Henry and Gabe also contribute to
the splintering or splitting of male, sorry mail, energy. Look at the end
of the last century -- those cissies Beardsley and Wilde.  Down with
weakness, physical, mental, or moral.  Be aware: I have no vested interest
in this post (I'm a man).

For me, a fascination with the idea of the poem going around what it is
"about" rather than directly on or through it. A circumnavigation rather
than description, or description of "everything but" the purported
subject.  Also, the tantalizing nature of omission. Strikethrough is a
sort of sleazy cousin to this, omitting, but allowing us to see what was
omitted. Good for those of us with insatiable nosiness.

Ah, yes, that's it, that sensation I was trying to pinpoint:  the feeling
of having my precious (male) bodily fluids drained, like Sterling Hayden
in Dr. Strangelove...

I meant to be poking fun at myself a little with the "enervation" thing,
even as I also had a point to make, but maybe that didn't come across.
But if we do seriously look at this thing from the standpoint of gender,
it seems to me that the more pertinent fact is that *only* four of the
twenty-five top-posters are women.  And the women who do post to the list,
or have tried to, have often complained about this sort of male dominance
of listchat.  Further, if you look at just the top 5 posters, or even the
top 10, they are *all* male.  It seems, then, that there may be an
interesting correlation between the predominantly male frequent-posting
phenomenon and the feeling of exclusion so many female listmembers have
complained about over the years.

steve, let me risk raising my tally to (1) post less than 100 words (an
amazing feat for me, as you all know by now), and (2) to say, with as much
(masculinist?) emphasis as possible, RIGHT ON re gender... of course to be
more inclusive means (and here i risk what is by now a bromide) to be
willing to entertain difference...

As one of the top five posters, but also a poster of usually very brief

Good question, but I think the answer doesn't need to bring in "larger"
philosophical/psychological stuff.  A interest in negative space and
clearing away room in the arts goes back at least as far as Matisse and
surfaces in a cyclical fashion from that time on.  For me this
"negative" interest is also more concrete and relates to the poem on the
page.

bill (and jim),
     while i applaud your interest in criticism of hypertext writing
that takes an interest in the "non technical" dimension, i'm more than a
little leery of separating technical and non technical aspects.  As a
writer I can't do this and in my "critical" work i'm finding that
drawing that particular distinction can be misleading.

"We need to see ourselves at depth and engaged: within the historical
scene, not confronting it, authoring the text of our future, projecting
and not projected upon."

"In constructive hypertexts we are able to see our thought in movement,
to see ourselves as light and not in shadows" Michael Joyce, _Of two
minds

And beyond Matisse to Rembrandt by way of Whistler. Check out their graphic
work. More recently in verse Schwerner's _Tablets_ is almost a dictionary
of negative space--origin late 60's.

joanna,

do you have time to post a part of the duplessis text that you feel speaks
to this issue and comment?  i haven't been able to get a hold of it yet...
a line of speculation one could trace regarding erased texts and blank
pages might go from mallarme's un coup de des, through blanchot and jabes,
to current work by anne-marie albiach and even barbara guest's latest,
which seems to be particularly "evacuated" (which along with "enervated"
seems to be my fin-de-siecle hommage for the week).  i'm interested in the
comparative evacuative strategies that might be at work here...

1. I would hate to see Elizabeth T. leave the list as she (gasp!)
actually posts about (gasp! gasp!) poetry and poetics, and has spurred
interesting discussions here. Also I wanna hear about the doings at
Double Lucy (my favorite press name).

2. Charles Bernstein is hereby named winner of the Bionic Eyeball Award
for having read ALL (gasp!) the posts on this list since its inception.
Good god, man! I think you should lie down or something.

3. I'm so pleased to have made someone's top 25 and, hey, I tied with
Ron Silliman.

4. I think efforts by Charles and Joel to moderate the list are made in
good faith and must be accompanied by good will and self-moderation on
the part of the listees.

Now, everyone get some sleep. We'll all feel better in the morning.

Peace,
Kathy Lou

Like many writers that I know I spend most of my time trying to find thing
to do that will distract me from the laborious task of writing.  Getting up
from the computer to start redecorating the room is not unheard of simply to
avoid the awful truth which is that I have to write to earn my living
(perhaps "justify my existence" is a more direct phrase albeit cliche).
Anyway the truth is, the lists to which I belong, yes I belong and receive
in indigestible(?)  form the whole content of 4 lists, I read.  In fact I
must be the singularly most clued up screwed up obsessively anal retentive
listee on the planet.

There is just nothing better in my day than the wonderfully chirpie voice
which announces, "incoming mail", this means I have to leave my work,
change screens and pay attention to some inane rambling from another,
stranger, world.  Occasionally I even respond to them. (like now).

So I do not mind leaving my work for the few moments which are required to
pay attention to mail, and I suppose I have the advantage of working mostly
when the majority of listees are asleep on the other sides (sic) of the
world.  But then again I am a really sad case, and suitable for treatment,
if it was not for the lists I think I would have to go train-spotting.

But seriously...  I really believe the lists are an impressive function of
the net phenomenon, and when the furore and immediacy of the fashion aspect
of the internet die down  (remember CB radio, hoola hoops et al) the lists,
perhaps developed into net meetings,  will be the abiding feature which
makes the technology worthwhile.

The problem I have with email is its lack of permanence.  Occasionally an
email will contain a splash of brilliance, (never the ones I write
unfortunately) and I always feel inclined to try and save them to a disc.
But whereas researchers have letters and notes available from past years,
little remains of the electronic transmissions of recent times, except the
list archives, but how permanent are they?

Any way keep posting and save me from myself,

Jim

Elizabeth,


This is unhappy news.  I am tempted to say that sending such a msg bc
rather than fc is cowardly, that no one has the right to tell anyone to
shut up and that if they like points so much they should stick their heads
in a pencil sharpener.

But I'd rather say how much I like your posts, all of which I read, and
which bring a valuable light to the list

ouch! mine's a 2B (or not too buzz-buzz, gloes that money). Maybe i
misunderstrode the question. You can't make a Hamlet without breaking
posts.

understanding (i'll respect your shit if you respect my shit?) often misses
the point as you so eloquently put it.  Shanks for the memo bro.

let this list roll  -  with respect (more quirky humours, less guffaws)

I mean, if this be turf, why so many people out cutting the grass?

love and love

tom, it is my hope to use any resource available but in particular to
get a project going on this list, & make a quantum leap out of the
necessary self consciousness weve been under the spell of.  anyone
working on this would have to agree to their "texts" being put up on a

Also there is Rauschenberg's famous erasing of a de Kooning drawing. RR
asked de Kooning for a drawing to be erased, and was given a mixed media
thing because de Kooning wanted to make it a difficult process.  RR
apparently used about a dozen different kinds of erasers to get the job
done, and he claimed it took him about a month to finish.

I've never seen this piece reproduced or in any collection: it just exists

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

This topic puts me in mind of the Anglo-Saxon palimpsests I worked with in the
British Museum.  Yes, they were "making room," recycling available "paper" by
erasing and writing over.  It is wonderful to see the old text underneath the
new, since erasing was hard work and not always fully accomlished.  Why was
the old text being erased?  Lack of vellum?  Mistakes?  New ideas needing
space?  Sometimes this erasure even made the latest text hard to read, which
was also in some sense marvelous, if somewhat frustrating.  You think of
archaeological tells when you read such a manuscript.  Also, Vikings, who
helped make texts scarce.

I also think of the Medieval approach to plagiarism.  You did simply use the
works of others as your own and you built on that, took of them whatever you
needed, and made your own work without blushing.  You hadn't stolen.
Everything built on everything else, the mindset of the palimpsest, in many
ways.

I realize this doesn't address the question below directly.  But will follow
indirection to truth if I can.  I thought the question excellent, one that
will keep turning over in my mind for time to come...

Cheers, Carmen

Some lines from DuPlessis,

from "Draft 17 Unnamed"

It's true that every ending only erases the board
rather then filling it.
The poems are written in strange chalk
strange, a chalk
in some light dark, plump with serifs
on a scumbled, agitated whiteness,
but mainly a white chalk on a whiter page.

from "Draft 26: M-m-ry"

On her cake the "e" in "years" got smudged.

From "Draft XXX: Fose"

Imagine a book, a little book
        whose words are covered
        one by one
with the smallest pebbles--


(As DuPlessis reminds us in her notes the book does exist, created by Ann
Hamilton) I have seen work by other artists that participates in a similar
blocking of letters.

--------------------

Also here's some Palmer
from "Disclosures" in _At Passages_

Beneath the writing on the wall
is the writing it was designed

to obscure. The two together
form a third kind


from "Untitled (February '92)"

Words are made of electrons it turns out
Words remind us of fragments it turns out

parts of legs and parts of arms
It's inviable ink which blots them out.


-----
My question, again, has to do with why these images of erased, smudged or
blocked text speak to us at this point in time. While I was typing this I
just remember that Heather McHugh has an essay on Tom Phillips _A
Hummument_(an art book in which a new story is created by blocking the old
text) in her book _Broken English_ In the essay, she writes

All poetry is fragment: it is shaped by its breakages, at every turn. It
is the very art of turnings, toward the white frame of the page, toward
the unsung, toward the vacancy made viable, that wordlessness in which
our words are couched. Its lines insistently defy their own medium by
averting themselves from the space available, affording the absent it say,
not only at the poem's outset and end but at each line's outset and end.

I suppose part of the reason there are so many poems and works of
art about "erased texts" is that we are now more self-conscious about the
 power of fragments than we were.

Some of the javascript pages I have at www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt
speak to this; in one, columns of text efface each other (depending on the
browser); in other, a text appears for a split second; in a third, with
changing pages, a black page appears - the text is black on black, visible
only by using the view command. www.jodi.org of course uses the view com-
mand a lot; what appears on the surface is often scrabbled. the piece i
did with overlapping columns, btw, is also readable in view - and view is
interesting, revealing the bones of works, to the extent that it's acces-
sible, i.e. not blocked from view itself.

finally, there are real-time effacements - if one is talking on ytalk for
example, where each letter typed appears as soon as it's typed, it may be
the case that a line is typed then suddenly erased, for example

i want you to make love to me

appears for a split second, then is gone. it's present and absent simul-
taneously, a trace or murmur, leaving an impression

one listmember, brenda iijima-uchman, will address this better than i will,
but in quick summary, brenda (who is unbelievably gifted visual artists as
well) and i were talking about revision.  brenda said that she tried not to
get stuck in past work, when i said thtat i would sometimes get work from
four or five years ago, and then angst about the mistakes/problems in it,
then try and fix it.  i think her mindset comes more from painting world,
where a big part of making art is knowing when to stop.  but she elaborated
about a sort of self-erasure, almost phoenix from the ashes in a sense.

she described getting interested in X problem(s) -- ideologic, philosophic,
materials-oriented -- and producing work addressing/connected to that
problem/query.  then at certain point, getting interested in new prob/que,
moving on to that, and letting go of old, letting that old body of work
"represent" her from that period and not going back to revise.

it would be interesting to know if this self-erasure is a visual/plastic
arts tendency, or if writers experience it as well.  if writing can be
whoops writers can be divided into those who practice self-erasure, who
view work as time-permeated and best left in its context, and those who,
like me, continually go back and ERASE parts of old work and palimpset
it into present work!  my hunch is that writers keep and revise.

Hello,

Rachel Democracy here, back on the list.  If at first you don't. . .

Just wanted to say I never did switch to the new email address, if any
of you tried to reach me at mindspring, would ya try me at my old email.

Also, does anyone have an email for Gilbert Alter-Gilbert
and does anyone have a suggestion for how to contact Christina Peri
Rossi?

P.S. Not a Review-- Went to see Peter Gizzi and John Ashbery yesterday
at Double Happiness/Segue reading series and feel renewed.  Peter read
some new work which seems more playful including a renewed piece, a
series of, I think 7 poems meditating on the boogieman.  I'd just the
night before met a dog named Boogie.  Ashbery was sparkling and funny
and lewd and open and I was very very happy.  He read unpublished work
and I'd thought I'd write down titles but I got carried away.  I was
amazed at how he's kept reinventing himself within himeself, his
singular Ashbery rhythm and how (this was the first time I'd seen him)
his voice was just exactly the voice I'd heard on taped readings, tears
literally popped out of my eyes!

P.S.S.  Could I start a thread on poetry residencies?  What has folkses
experience been?

Thanks a mill,
R. Democracy

> Joanna --

    I tend to think that the poetics (or the aesthetics ) of erasure are one
of the 2 dominant modes (the other being its near opposite, that of the
ever-unfolding fullness of the world in the text, say, the gamble  of EP's
Cantos etc.) that poetry has taken since the early days of modernism -- I'd
put Mallarmé up there as as one core originator of this thought. And, in his
wake, a whole range of French poetry this century, a quasi "minimalist" mode
-- the likes of Daive, Du Bouchet, Albiach, Royet-Journoud. (Literally, much
of their work is based on erasing text from first draughts, eliminating words,
whittling what they consider the too full representational magma of written
text they start from down to a final structure that consists of a careful
interplay of "le Blanc" the (mallarmean) whiteness of the page and the few
inscribed traces of text left over. That sense of "erasure" is also allied to
a range of notions developed later by Maurice Blanchot (absence, unworking,
etc.)
    The term "erasure" in the sense of something being "under erasure"as such
comes, if I'm not mistaken, into French theoretical thought via Derrida out of
Heidegger.

related to erasures:  well worth checking out jim rosenberg's hypercard
project, _intergrams_ (available from eastgate systems), where word
clusters materialize and dematerialize by moving the cursor, each cluster
consisting of lines that partially obscure other lines...

I've been reading over, trying to digest some of the discussion in
this amazing posting-politics thread (for I am one of the six no-mail
"active" listees Joel alluded to). Now that Ron has posted the
numbers, we know who has caused all this trouble: a handful of
bulemic-like posters, the three most afflicted of whom have, over the
entire month of November, averaged a fraction more than (get your
calculators out) _one post per day_. In these bulemia sweepstakes, I
come in third, and I apologize to any one of the hundreds at this
table who has been made by my condition during the month of November
(or other months, though Nov. has been the cuelest one for me, I
believe) to feel marginalized, silenced, enervated, bored, nauseous,
whatever. I admit I sometimes have a problem with controlling my
appetite, and I would gladly take every one of those posts back and
even never post again if it would help in some small way to save the
List from this crisis of too many posts-per-person-- a crisis that is
ever and dangerously deepening as those individuals who seem most
anxious about the problem (including males worried about too many
males posting) are now bombarding the List with multiple posts per
day in an attempt to theorize how this problem might be solved
without hurting the feelings of those poor souls who post too much. I
mean the irony of this is so rich and effortless it kind of makes a
try-too-hard ironist like me want to hurl chunks of envy all over
my screen!

And could I ask if it's someone's joke or if it's _really_ the case
that Henry Gould, the poster who most passionately and consistently
and intelligently talks about Poetry on this List (though I
am personally enervated by a good deal of what he says), has really
been temporarily "86'd"?? What's the story with this, anyway? My
solution to the problem: Let people like Henry, who post and psot
about Poetry and the difficult love for it post all they want so as
to keep the List at its core focused and debating about what the List
is here for, for goodness sakes. Let there be one, two, three, many
Henry's. Then all the peripheral jabberers like me and some others
who like to talk about cadavers and sex and slinky underwear will
just be an amusing sideshow instead of an ontological cul-de-sac..

Along with DuPlessis and Armand Schwerner, Ronald Johnson is
one of  the most interesting and brilliant "erasers."

I *never* go back to old work and always order book manuscripts
chronologically, because they are written in/for a specific time & are then
finished. I can't imagine working with an old text. I don't want the
psychological baggage of having to feel responsible for "unfinished" pieces
forever. I figure it's done once it's published in a mag, and I erase the whole
manuscript from disk once it's published as a book. And *that* erasure is such
a pleasing one!

But I was a sculpture major undergrad.

This is my first posting to the Poetics list.

I write from Glasgow, Scotland.

I receive the Digest of this Poetics List to keep informed about US poetics
and poetry - I do buy books on a regular basis - I'm sort of educating myself
in recent
poetry, realising a couple of years ago thatI knew very little about the
poetry being written right now.

So I feel kind of inexpert pitching in on topics, although I do gain a great
deal from lurking.

Recently, I have been re-assessing my approach e-lists. I value the
discussions but feel, as a reader, that  I need to absorb what is happening at
quite a slow
rate: pressures of work, time to catch up with issues I know nothing about
preclude hitting the Reply button.

So I digest.

Best wishes
Stuart Mitchell

dear joel -- and to the many blessed persons who are writing in about
writing in to this community chest,
  i am on the list of 'set to nomail' list members.  i would like to
stand and confess my reasons: email space (the in-box gets flooded) &
time (it's hard to check and read and delete all the time to keep it
from getting flooded).  having no desire either to separate myself or to
discourage the flow of words on this list (why not change the maximum
number of permissable messages to 75, or 100, a day? -- is there any
particular technical reason? -- or is 50 a kind of happy maximum?), my
solution is to read postings through the wonderfully organized archives
you maintain (or the machine, having been programmed wonderfully,
maintains).  i click on my 'poetics archive' bookmark and scroll through
postings for individual months.  i usually do so every day.  i watch the
subjects build and build ('numbers, daughter of the book -- 2
messages'), and i love to read poetics this way.  it's like a new book
every month -- you never know how it will end.  and then -- january
comes!
  so even though i =seem= to be a nonparticipant, my 'nomail' setting
belies my constant reading of poetics posts.  i wonder how many others
do this?

   i've always been intrigued by the word 'lurkers' -- it sounds so
voyeuristic, so slurpy and hungry and shy and full of unsatisfied
desires.  but when i read a book, say, i don't feel like a lurker, even
though the words i mutter as i'm reading resonate only against the walls
of my room.

   i don't post much because (apart from the kind of busy life-building
we're all doing) what i might write usually swerves away from
'conversation' -- into something i'd rather write essays about, i guess
-- and this doesn't feel like an unmediated literary talking time, to
me.  there are eternal recurrences here -- i'm glad to read them -- but
even now i have a sense that i'm adding water to the wordy world.

  nonetheless, i will send this, prompted to tell joel that people are
perhaps listening more than they seem to be.  or at least this people
is.
     thanks to all who do write.  really.
lisa s.

My memory of the story is that Rauschenberg somewhat self-effacedly asked

I'm sorry that Elizabeth is opting out, but before I become the latest bete
noire I think I'd better reproduce my entire backchannel discussion
(complete, I think--I may have edited a line or two before saving) with her.

E. [frontchannel] I would especially like the conversation to be more
thoughtful, essayish,
and most importantly about topics that feel IMPORTANT (compelling,
generative ? -- oh excuse me!) to me. Such as occurs in my small
reading/writing group here in the Bay Area, where we read a book
superclosely, and yes, sometimes get in entanglements.  I am hungry for
places to discuss writing

M. [bc] Then why not bring those discussions to the list? Unless you try
and no one listens there's not much to complain about.

E. [bc] I have tried, just not recently.  Early summer, Gertrude Stein;
later, Laura
Riding -- my asking seemed to spark a lot of conversation, which I listened
rather than added to.  And there were some others.

M. [bc] My point exactly--one can raise issues and provoke comment, even as
things stand.
Instead we get all this handwringing. The list rapidly turns into a gestalt
therapy session.

Bully that I am, I thought that we were having a conversation. And I do
think that it was appropriate to go backchannel (all 400 or 700 of us
really fascinated by this interchange?). And I reiterate that it's just bad
manners to publish a private interchange by going frontchannel without
permission.

PS. I just looked up bete noire in my handy dandy Larousse. Seems the
phrase originally meant wild boar, and not just any black beast, something
I truly don't wish to become, despite the flavor.

 --you gotta check this out. Truly amazing. A museum to poetic
spirit unbounded. There is also the magical book on the MJT from a
couple years ago, _Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder_, thoguh I don't
have author's name handy.

How about postings from time to time on favorite web sites
Listfarians might check into? I sit at my Alta Vista Search window

No no Dan, it is not at Albright-Knox, it is (or will be shortly) here in
San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, hooray!!  The Museum here has a new
director the notorious David Ross lately of the Whitney and to welcome him
the trustees must have spent a zillion dollars to buy all kinds of things,
incl. the Erased de Kooning drawing (purchased directly from Rauschenberg)
and San Francisco's first Eva Hesse, Mondrian, etc., some incredibly
beautiful works.  When I go to the museum now I feel sad because my
favorite piece is on loan (Jackson Pollock's "Guardians of the Secret") for
the big Pollock retrospective but on the other hand they have just acquired
that famous Magritte one, mm, I can't remember what it's called ("Personal
Values"?  "Relative Values"?) but you know, the walls of the room look like
the sky and there's a giant comb, shaving brush, pill, all leaning against
the furniture of an ordinary bed sitting room.

Well, come on down everyone, to San Francisco and take a look.  Besides the
erased De Kooning drawing they also have the Rauschenberg piece where John
Cage drove a truck over huge sheets of paper.  Heavy metal thunder.  Oh,
and the original drawings ("they" say) for Duchamp's "Bride Stripped Bare
by her Bachelors, Even," even.

For some reason (perhaps because of my derangement) I've kept your post

Yes, and Heidegger could be seen as a kind of pivot here and antidote to
both a naive realism and positivism. Its Heidegger the phenomenologist
as much as Heidegger the existentialist and its springs from his
understanding of the futility of Husserl's approach where Husserl
intends to peal away the inefficient aspects of languages relation to
the 'real' by applying a mode of discourse that he has systematically
unraveked from the sclerotic accretions of centuries and to eliminate
the need for ever proliferating sets of meta-contrivances while
acknowleding the contigent demands of time. Thus Logical Investigations
is in its own way a very absorbing failure. Husserl kept freezing
(trapping) the entity he wanted to free in his language, a natural
result of analysis or verbal vivisection. I find Kant useful here in
that he insists ding an sich cannot be captured through in its wholeness
(see Bohm). It always struck me that he was quite presciently saying,
and their are plenty of writers who have winnowed the same idea so its
no big deal here, that knowledge is contingent. Schopenhauer among other
things covered Kant's flank by foreseeing the need to address questions
arising from what he called 'naive realism.' These same fundamental
questions above were at the heart of the philosophical revival in the
physics community around quantum theory in the late twenties and early
thirties (see Heisenberg, Physics and Beyond. also Hansen, Bohr,
Feyerabend, Putnam, Quine etc, etc, ad nauseam) and not surprisingly
have been unconsciously fundamental to the debate leveled by
conservative elements in the scientific community as well as the
Cartesian left of Noam Chomsky and Alan Sokal against Deconstruction and
Postmodernism. The problem is these factions (with the exception of
Chomsky who is simply an unabashed Cartesian) ignore the roots of
Decon/Postmod in European Transcendental Philosophy and the
philosophical debate such as that which resulted in the Copenhagen
Interpretation surrounding discoverys in quantum mentioned above. The
criticism from Gross, Levitt, Sokal et al also lacks a sense of play,
that is a sense of/for art which is found in Derrida, Foucault, Latour
or as an artist might say the freedom to simply say it, whatever it
might be. As Pierre suggests art and especially poetry has a huge stake
in this. Mallarme, Pound, Olson, (well the list is immense) have all
sensed that the fragment provides an alternative epiphanic glimpse at an
essence. The Pinsky/Howe debate touched upon some of these issues. I've
always suspected that Pound came to possiblities of the fragment, at
least in part, when he 'edited' the Wasteland erasing long, narrative
passages while maintaning enough of Eliot's text to provide a series of
'luminous details.' I like to think that the enervated harmony of
personal anguish in the context of historical anxiety that is the
Wasteland as we know it, must have continually stunned Pound (and
suggested a form for the Cantos) as he simply went about cutting much of
Eliot's personal narrative away. We haven't looked at translations of
ancient texts which exist only in fragments, in the same way since the
moderns. Derrida and deconstruction as well as postmodernist writers are
familiar with all the threads I awkwardly touched upon above. In this
their contribution if not entirely unique (e.g. The Frankfurt School) is
in direct and oblique ways highly supportive of art and poetry in
particular in a world that largely doesn't give a damn. Erasure is a
preposturous notion to, say, a Cartesian rationalist or a pragmatist.
What is left out can't be measured. Unlike a mathematical equation, The
elidings do not follow rules and the result is evocative and not
necessarity 'elegant' though Mallarme's Un Coup de Des certainly
qualifies as both.---Carlo Parcelli

        Thats' how the message from Julia, to Winston Smith, would have
appeared then disappeared (v. Sondheim, Re Era sure) had 1984 been written
today.

Thats mainly what I wanted to say, but feeling obliged to provide further
substance, would remark that this novel's chief contribution is not its
vision of a future, banal as it is, but its life as a love story--which is
also a de (con) struction of the love affair.  Perhaps the vision was not
banal in 1948, but to those of us who have lived thru the 50 years since,
it is--whereas the excruciating anaylsis of passionate love and the society
whose stability is thought to depend upon its repression, has currency and
will travel.

Or, in the interests of a more interactive, kind und gentle List, consider
those assertions to be couched as questions. They certainly open themselves
to qualification. . . .

Juliana Spahr has written a stimulating and brief work called "Spiderwasp
or Literary Criticism" (Spectacular Books, 1998). Beside the metaphor, the
"or" refers to the verso/recto binary of narrative and text; the recto also
vertically divided with provoking notes.

Spahr has begun an initial mapping of contemporary poetry in terms that
have often been discussed on this List; namely, from where/what is current
poetry taking its cues: new american? post-language? both? neither?
Through the works of three "emerging" writers, again briefly, Spahr applies
this query. It's thoughtful and direct and articulate.

I read it Saturday and felt compelled to recommend it.

Perhaps Katy Lederer can post the ordering information again.

To which I would adduce the qualifying example of Joan Retallack's
"AI/D/SAPPEARANCE" from HOW TO DO THINGS WITH WORDS: this elegy follows
rules of subtraction which are brutally rigorous.  "Evocative" does not
feel like the right word for the resulting illustration of systematic
erasure.  The poem eliminates groups of letters from itself, and sort of
spirals into nothingness like a curled shell.  Near the end, the remaining
y's and n's (and a single x) become merely "y", which is more plaintive
and angry than evocative because it can be vocalized as a full sentence.
The shorthand for "yes" becomes a pun for "why?"  When it goes, there is
only silence and invisibility rather than the play of the fragment.  But
this blankness is only one state in the series, so perhaps it is a
fragment.  Does its situation as the final state in the series endow it
with a special status?

Whether or not the silence of the dead can be read in/as text, and whether
or not this silence is total or irrevocable would seem to be related to
the issues of how Derrida, Blanchot et al theorize erasure and the
connection between body and inscription.  And in turn whether absence of
text can represent death, or instead must always represent more text.
Can there be different kinds of palimpsests, created by different gestures
of blotting, erasing, tracing, collaging.......?  Schwerner's
Tablets........Is blankness possible only as a hypothetical case beyond
the horizon of the line?

Only slightly (well, maybe more than that) changing the subject, there are
other examples of "brutally rigorous" rules producing evocative work.  For
example, the programs Jim Rosenberg created to realize the vision of John
Cage (this was the stuff with key words appearing vertically down the
middle of the page, a sort of variation on acrostic, taken from existing
texts --- anyone remember the name of this form?).

Back to the subject --- absence of text can represent many things besides
death or more text.  And why should it represent anything at all?

Henry gently says goodbye. Though he did mention trained seals.
I guess he didn't like the doghouse, despite all the fine and
well-aimed bones. I've never met Henry.  But he definitely is a
big shaggy person in my mind.  Is personality too raw for poetics?

What do you guys really think about censorship/moderation?  I know in my
own case I was taken aback, on November 7, when I received an unsigned
advisory notice telling me "to keep posts to the list close to the focus
of the list as indicated in the Welcome Message."  How many of you have
received such warnings?  Being fairly new to the list, I posted news of
my advisory notice but received no feedback.  I can only conclude that
such notices are either very common or very rare.

How many of you have been in the doghouse?  Are you still on the list and
why?

I thought some may be interested to know that the Special Collections
Library at the University of Michigan just acquired the papers of Anne
Waldman, described as "over 24,000 manuscripts, letters, business and
personal documents, photos, and audiotapes." The collection at this point
is totally unprocessed, meaning it will be some months before it will be
ready for regular use. Kathryn Beam (kjmb@umich.edu) notes that interested
parties can contact her, though, with specific questions, with the caveat
that details about items included in the archive are not now fully known
by the staff.

A Pollock quote I have on my desk where I write poetry, to remind me of
something I find true:

When I am in my painting, I'm not aware of what I'm doing.  It is only after a
sort of "get acquainted" period that I see what I have been about.  I have no
fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting
has a life of its own.  I try to let it come through.  It is only when I lose
contact with the painting that the result is a mess.  Otherwise there is pure
harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.

First of all, congratulations to Kent Johnson for his astute detection of
delicious ironies like: males posting to the list about males posting too
much!  This one was so juicy it almost squirted me in the eye when I bit
into it.  Luckily, I was wearing my irony goggles.  Also luckily, I'm not
all that afraid of irony anyway--or Kent's post might seem to suggest that
there is no way for males to attempt to address questions of gender
inequity.  This would be a convenient way of thinking, in that us males
would be absolved from ever having to talk about the issue.  But I'm sure
this isn't what Kent would want to suggest, given the urgent interest in
political and social issues he has often demonstrated in his posts.
Oops--things are getting delicious again!

Also, just for the record, if Henry has really left the list it's a shame,
and I for one would never have wanted it to happen.  As I've said
front-channel and back-channel, and will say again, I've always valued a
great deal of what Henry has had to say.  I hope he'll come back.  I've
also been operating under the assumption, though, that the list wouldn't
be hurt by a little self-examination, by an exploration of how to enrich
the conversation, perhaps by including more voices, etc.  But for some
folks any suggestions along these lines seem to be interpreted as a sort
of quasi-fascistic intervention into a situation (the status quo) that was
somehow always already "free."  This strikes me as a profoundly
*conservative* reaction, even as it comes from folks who like to think of
themselves as rebels and radicals.

Dear List, as I was erasing a lot of messages, 365 piled up in a few
days (cf. Big Debate, inc. gender isues [finally!], moderations,
etc), I came upon <me> and the issue of erasing. So of course, I
stopped erasing, and started posting. I am interested in memory and
the issues of amnesia (personal and historical). This interest is
both personal (I have a bad--i.e. porous-- memory) and historical (in
the twentieth century there are many attempts to obliterate groups,
to erase them from the face of the earth). The trauma of amnesia and
the trauma of remembering, witnessing are intertwined for me. My
interest did not begin "textually" (that is solely as a question of
rhetoric, representation, or formal interests) tho it takes shape
textually. There is (for me) no sense of textuality as a value in a
vacuum; making texts, and alluding to textual stuff (like black
pages, or glosses) is absolutely linked to depths of ethical and
social and poetic feeling. I don't know whether this is totally
clear. I am a little wary of putting my own poems up here, but the
following, for those who want to read it, might be germane. From
Draft 17: Unnamed (in _Drafts 15-XXX, The Fold_) The first 11 lines
are cited and italicized.
                                She stood at the pit
                                        where, this 50 years,

                155 Jews were shot.
                                There, near a field of rye,
                                        she'd found dozens of notes and addresses

                tossed away
                                moments before their deaths.
                                        To this day,

                she regrets
                                that, out of fear,
                                        She did not pick them up.

                The poetics seems plain.
                                Since then
                                        there ar many people spend their time

                picking up the notes.
                                But they are not there.
                                        They are as gone as possible to be.

                So the gathering
                                is imposible.
                                        But still the shapes are bowed,

                and search
                                this otherwhere of here.
                                        Yet had they actually

                been there
                                that time
                                        being remembered,

                it is equally possible
                                they too would have left
                                        all of them where they lay.

Subject:      why I am not a reader of the poetics list

This is my confession.

I can't read poetics list anymore. I have a shortage of time in my life.
I have a loss of patience. I am a girl and it feels like it isn't a
friendly place for girls. In fact, some days it feels like it is only
friendly to white men. I know I generalize. That is why I use the word
feel.

But what I mean to write here is why I am sad about the poetics list.

I like to buy books. I like to send money to small presses and get
things made by hand back. I like to read these and then put these in my
bookshelves. They bring me comfort at faculty meetings where it is said
that younger people do this or don't do that and and thus they should
all be punished. Or they give me something to read on long airplane
trips back to the contiguous 48.

But because I can't read poetics list I can't get all the good
announcements of books to buy.

At one point, years ago, someone, was it Marjorie?, suggested that the
poetics list be a place of announcements only. This was protested. I
myself wasn't so sure it was a good idea.

But might it not be time to reconsider this?

There are various ways now that one can set up one's own list for free.
And those that have lifestyles that allow them to read a lot and post a
lot and feel like the place is friendly for them and like to post a lot,
well they should be posting a lot. Isn't that the right of boundless
opportunity of electronic and consumer society? But maybe they should be
doing this with those that like to read a lot of postings on a list set
up for this. The high post poetics list say? Or it might good now to
have total listserve anarchy and for there to no longer be a central
convesation but rather for there to be the creation of self-governing,
special interest lists.

And then the poetics list could be the announcement of readings list.
Really I would like it to be the call for work, the announcement of
readings, the I published this, the order this, the does anyone know
where this quotation is from, and the brief review of something I read
recently list. With maybe around 5-6 posts per day.

Or in my utopia there would be no conversation. No I agree or I
disagree. No so and so is stupid. All that would go on the adjunct list
for day to day conversation or the one for good general loving
conversation or the one for many posts per day conversation or the one
for attacking conversation among those who have the wonderful luxury of
time or the better abilities of efficiency than me.

I don't know. I just makes me sad that this list, which is a huge, and
perhaps only, information resource, is something that I can't do or that
feels hostile.

I miss the old days.

With kindness and loving and trying not to be insulting,

Juliana Spahr

List companions:

Charles Bernstein posted me b-c in response to my message
yesterday about the posting wars. Below is my response to him.
Because a later message from him this AM suggests he misunderstood
the concerns I was trying to express in my reply to him below, and
because I think the issues involved are very important (Henry Gould's
apparent quitting of the List shows that the issues are, indeed,
important),  I thought I would share my letter to Charles. I don't do
this lightly, nor do I presume, even, that most people on the List
wish to discuss the controversy any further. There seems to be an
understandable desire to move on and to "get back to the way things
were." But I do feel that there are some things that have been left
unsaid in all of this, and unless they are fully and honestly
discussed, things will never really be "the way they were," at
least as I have come to understand and love the spirit of this List.
So as someone who has been quite active on this space over the past
couple of years and and as someone who feels grateful for the
deep enjoyment and _true education_ that activity has provided, I
feel compelled to say a few things, realizing tht doing so may well
perhaps lead to my own leaving of the List.

I wrote in a post yesterday (the one with the barely believable title
"My one post for December"), that the real issue in this whole
affair has nothing to do with numbers as the consensus has painted
it. If it did, then why not just cut people off after the alloted
five posts, or reduce the daily limit for everyone to provide more
space? Or how could it really have to do with numbers if, as I
pointed out, Henry-- poster numero uno-- averaged only a fraction
more than one post per day for the whole month of November. He and
Gabe Gudding-- Gudding at number three with the most posts-- have
been told (and I ask to be corrected if I'm wrong), that their posts
are to now be reviewed and judged before they may appear. But I, _as
poster number two_, have been forewarned of nothing and have been
reassured by Charles that no one has made a move to do so. All of
these things put together only reaffirm for me the unpleasant and
fairly obvious truth that no one seems willing to frankly discuss:
That what has given rise to this whole affair is a somehow unwelcome
_content_ in the sometimes biting, even, yes, iconoclastic, posts of
Gould and Gudding-- a contentious content that is being "corrected"
(and with the apparent acquiescence or direct approval of many on
this List) through ideological monitoring and outright
censorship. And I choose my terms so as to call a spade a spade.

I'm frankly stunned by this development. And I reject the argument
that this is merely a matter of excercising an unfortunate but
sometimes needed control for the benefit of the greater community.
Yes, there would certainly be bizarre situations that would warrant
such action, but no one has expalined _what it is_ about Gould and
Gudding's posts that would warrant this turn of events. I, for one,
as a member of the List, truly grateful, as I make clear below, for
all of Charles's vision and work in makeing this space possible in
the first place, do not want to be--cannot bring myself to be-- part
of a "community" that has drawn an unacknowledged but very real
invisible shock fence around it-- especially of a community that
exists to discuss, quarrel, and _collectively_ search this unbounded
and always opening subject of poetry.

I want to make absolutely clear that in stating these concerns I am
in no way impugning "bad" motives to anyone. Let me be clearer at
the risk of seeming maudlin: I have a sense of debt to Cahrles
Bernstein, though he doesn't know it, not only out of tahnks for his
efforts on this List but also in the sense that I have learned much
from his thought in poetics, as I have from a number of other peopel
on this List. I'm even granting Charles the best of intentions in
his actions. But I do think there is an unacknowledged "political
unconscious" at work in the moves to "exercise control" of the List,
think that those moves are unfortunate ones, and I'm not going to let
any gratitude and indebtedness I might feel keep me from saying what
I think. If peopel _would_ say what they really think about this
matter THEN the List can truly get back to the way it was, and
perhaps, even, a person valuable to the rich heteroglossia of our
conversation like Henry will come back. I hope so anyway.

Charles:

No, no one has asked me to reduce my postings, but I have to wonder
why, since in the past couple of months I have posted almost as
much as Henry and more than Gabe Gudding. In expressing your
concern that the List had recently been topping out at 50, your post
to everyone suggested that the issue was numbers, and the crisis-like
disussion has indeed focused on that as the "problem." And so
this frankly leads me to feel, especially following Ron's smoke 'em
out tally, that most of those expressing concern must well have had
me in mind as one of the "troublemakers." My own concern (and I know
it is shared by others) is that the numbers really have very little
to do with this and that what underlies the brouhaha is an
impatience on the part of some with the stubborn and feisty voicing
of positions that counter the dominant "aesthetic politics" of the
List. It should be reaffirmed, and clearly, I think, that people on
the List can argue for any kind of Poetics they want to. Ove rthe
past year or so that has been the case, wiht Henry adding much of the
exotic spice, and _in part_ because of that this List has been a
great place to be, a big renga-house to wander and think and
learn within.

Most recently, Gabe Gudding's hilarious and sometimes biting rants
were a perfectly healthy thing for the List, whcih I consider to be a
wonderful, wonderful thing, and for which I, like everyone, am
very grateful to you. Please take the above, then, as an honestly
felt critique of your (surprising, to me) intervention into the
controversy (which was _really_ sparked, I feel, by Gudding's
cheekiness contra Perloff), and understand that it is offered in
appreciation for the tremendous effort over the years that you have
given to make this space exist in the first place. But I think it
would have been best to simply let things ride-- and it would be
best, in my humble opinion, to not step-up any kind of level of
"supervision."

Sincerely,
Kent

Jim Bennett and George Thompson asked for any resources on Paul Auster's
poetry.  I dug through bibliographic sources --  most of which is in
French or German.  In fact, it's quite startling and disturbing to see the
reception and commentary Auster receives in Europe and how relatively
ignored he is in the US.  I found only one article about his poetry: "In
the Realm of the Naked Eye: The Poetry of Paul Auster" by Norman
Finkelstein in the collection of esays on Auster's work, Beyond the Red
Notebook (Phil: U of Penn, 1995).  Of course, most of his work is fiction
(and now film), so the paucity of criticism on his poetry has some
explanation.  But, given the questions of poetics  he addresses (such as
the erasure discusion going on right now), his fiction and poetry should
be receiving far more attention than it has.  This may be one instance
where "academic" or more scholarly consideration is far behind other
venues.  Perhaps other folks know more and can share..

                "You are impertinent, they said to me.
                I'm not impertinent, I said: I'm lost."

                          -- Brecht, "Emigrant's Lament"


I was going to reserve this 30 min's of freetime tht I now have for
posting a few more thoughts on the THEORY OF SLAPSTICK POETICS.  But the
news of Henry's departure has so saddened me I am moved to write a
meta-poetics commentary.

The little backchanneling of late that CB and I have done is I think
fairly summed up by the above quote.

Some have said CB is killing an essential part of this list with his
interventions.

I have even gone so far as jokingly to call CB a controlling prig.

One or two of us have however gone on to compliment CB on his open-minded
and fair attitude (I am one of these). I compliment CB on his open mind.

Then some have come on and wrongly and scathingly denounced CB as a
pompous, washed-up, control-freak who has chained letters to an outdated
linguistic ideology and is someone unwilling to face the literary reality
that little if any true BRISANCE can be found among the work of those who
subscribe to this ideology and that his over-editing of this list's tone
and content in order that no one malign this ideology is bruising the
fruit of the orchard that is this list, thereby reducing its boinky of
bounty.  But I think that's more than unfair and possibly grossly
inaccurate.

Some have even insisted that this list now be killed off in the name of
all that is decent, just, fair, true, wise, excellent, healthy,
progressive, non-tv-oriented, and ecologically sound.

But I am not one of these.  I love this list and its boinky of bounty.

But already I miss Henry.

Some -- not I -- wrote in saying CB was a mistake, a literary accident, a
flash-in-the-pan turned into a slightly-lingering coruscation-in-the-air
and soon to blip into a retinal after-image on the disco-floor of letters
(and whoever wrote THAT obviously had no sense of when enough is enough.)
AGAIN, I am not one of these: I enjoy his work. It is important. Besides,
this is everyone's fate.

Some have said it is quite plain CB's muzzling of Gould & yrs truly had
little to do with volume and more to do with content -- perhaps GG's
subject lines might indicate something here: "Ross Feld on Bernstein,"
"Bernstein and The Avant-Bored," "Bernstein Better a Haberdasher,"
"Marjorie Perloff is Wrong" etc etc.  All of which is irrelevant, unless
of course someone says different.

Despite my subject lines, I don't stand with these people: I have thanked
CB both publically and privately for his open-mindedness, Indeed I am the
_Boyuna_ the harmless snake of Ceylon.

Some have even forgodsake written in impotently flaming that in the name of
all that keeps our lungs pink CB should forthwith be removed post-haste
like Pinsky from his poet-post, since he never deserved it in the first
place these people are beneath contempt icky icky. They are sciolists and
nothing more.

But let us forgive these people.  They are only a little LOST in their
thinking. And afterall, what is an avant-garde but a group of artists
dedicated to being lost?

WITH WHOM THEN DO I STAND?  With my fellow lost, of course.

MY AFFILIATIONS ARE WITH THOSE WHOSE IDEALS MATCH THOSE MENTIONED IN THE
WELCOME MESSAGE OF THIS LIST.  Despite many of their foibles, these Lost
have much to say: a great deal of it is said in disagreement, with varying
tone, with wild conjecture, with blicky froth of death, with mild
I-would-hit-you's and with rash I-Hate-You-I-Hit-You's.  In the words of
the sage, It's all good. Let's suffer our mutual foibles (enervating and
annoying though they be) for the sake of our many fruits.

With whom then do I stand?  The lost.  Not the found or the well-housed;
not the comfortable.  And certainly not with the well-behaved.



Be wise and write well.  Warmly, Gabe

[[ps, and when that editor at Gladhanding U Quarterly Journal writes you
and says "I like everything about your poem but THE TONE, just wanna
change a few things and then I'll publish it," would you think twice about
saying "Puh, no thank you"?  I'm sure Mairead Byrne wouldn't, Henry
wouldn't. And Bernstein wouldn't, that's for sure.

God bless this list and its boinky of bounty:  God bless Charles and
Joel!  God bless Henry Gould!

& since nonymity is what it's all about: A pubic and wholehearted thankyou
to Henry, Joel, Charles, Mairead, Elliza and Eliza, Steve Shoemaker, Joe's
Amato & Brennen, Callow Parcelli, KENT JOHNSON, George Thompson, Billy
Little, oh and Marjorie Perloff & others for hashing this out. Now: who's
got henry's ph #?

Subject:      Note on the Indo-European origins of Gabe Gudding's game
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Gabe Gudding and I have been talking off-list about the history of
"insultive traditions". Since I am aware of such traditions in old
Indo-European at least, I thought that some of the list might be interested
to know that there is a kind of long intellectual background to what GG has
been doing on this list.

An Old Irish poet [a fili, a 'seer'], for example, if you annoyed him
enough, could curse, mock, revile, or 'insult' you. And you would become
shamed, or disgraced, or even disfigured, as a result. You might even die
of shame, if the poet were a really good one in this genre. We call it
blame poetry these days. I wonder if anyone on this list has suffered any
disfigurement, etc., lately.

Maybe it would be interesting to consider Gabe's game in light of Old
English 'flyting' [see OED 'flite, flyte'], or the Old Norse verbal duels
that Loki, among the gods, was fond of. You could also check out "The
Contest of Homer and Hesiod" [or, even better, the BATRAXOMYOMAXIA, 'The
Battle of the Frogs and Mice']. Or, on a more perssonal note, look at what
happened when Archilochus trashed Lycambes [L. and his three daughters
unfortunately committed suicide, so they say].

Walter Ong has been mentioned on this list in the past. He is the Jesuit
who has been interested in oral literature and oral consciousness since the
sixties, and has written some books that many on the list know about
[*Presence of the Word*, *Interfaces of the Word*, *Orality and Literacy*,
and something called *Fighting For Life: Contest, Sexuality and
Consciousness*]. In this last one Ong examines the agonistic roots of
culture [esp. male culture], and claims that oral literature is
predominantly agonistic, that academic culture is predominantly agonistic,
and that intellectual culture in general is predominantly agonistic. Hard
to argue with him, given our own experience. Isn't poetic culture
predominantly agonistic too?

I don't know if this is a cultural universal. In general, I don't trust
claims of cultural universality. But in any case this list's behavior seems
to confirm Ong's thesis, as does my familiarity with Vedic culture and
literature. May I trouble the list with one more example, this time from
Vedic literature? [Please erase this if you please; erasure is interesting
too, to be sure...].

People tend to think of the Vedas as populated by wise or vacant swamis and
yogis, or chanting brahmins pouring smoking ghee into midnight fires. Well,
there's some of that in them. But there is a surprising lot also of what
Gabe calls "insultive tradition."

Now the Vedic horse sacrifice, which I do believe tells us more about
ourselves than the Pisan Cantos do [no, I don't know why], has many
interesting features which I'm sure the list would enjoy [Bowering and
Bromige in particular, but let's not go there]. But I will confine myself
to the insults that are exchanged between the brahmins on the one hand and
the chief queens on the other [an exchange that immdiately follows the
riddling that frames the central mystery of this Vedic "Mass": the
sacrifice of the horse].

I won't get into what the horse and the chief queen do, though that is in
fact what triggers the insults that follow. The brahmins proceed to insult
the queens by calling tauntingly to the queens' little tweetees [literally:
little birds]., and the queens respond to this taunting by insulting the
size of the brahmins' little peckers [literally again: little birds].

Well, a whole lot of indiscriminate insulting, of a shockingly graphic
sexual kind, ensues, [including the suggestion, made by the guy who has
sponsored the whole damned expensive sacrifice, the king himself, that the
queen should be buggered by his proxy, the horse...]. Makes you want to
convert to Buddhism.

Well, in the end, or up the rear, the point is this: according to the
Vedas, "insulting speeches are for all kinds of attainment, for through the
horse sacrifice all desires are achieved..."

So what has Gabe attained? I don't know. But you're supposed to end the
Vedic horse sacrifice with some sweet smelling verses, in order to
propitiate those who have been offended [i.e., the gods]. And Gabe I think
has done things as prescribed in the Vedas, after all.

So, why has Henry Gould been sacrificed as well? There seems to me to be no
need for this, since all of the *correct* insulting has already been
accomplished, and, after all, it was only a ritual.

The ritual is supposed to protect us from the real.... what has happened here?

to
charles & joel
& the players

feels to me
like the silence & confusion
imposed upon the list
comes from a lot of
wondering from all of us
"am I to be censured, scolded, moderated next?"


beyond the question of
whether st henry or st gabe or st kent
conformed to some mysterious preconception
of list ettiquette, is a need
as a reader to want to build a
faith & trust among this written community
so that what we say is supported
& given chance to rise about the ordinary,
to be more than digit noise in the cathode fantasy.

my understanding of such establishing of trust includes
having available to us the microscopic truth of
what the saint fuck is going on, that moderation
& the wizard behind the curtain is exposed & made visible,
so that we can put a stop to wondering
if we are are the next target

& speaking personally, Im prompted to jump into
this for a moment, not because Im paranoid,
but because this textual wilderness comes with responsibilities &
accounting,
which would seems to me to be relevant to the list
as a whole, not just the select few who are closest
to the editorial closet

When I die, I want to take you with me,
 I want to take ten of the ten, and fifteen of the fifteen,
  And I will wear the dreary blue-blue you have given me -
There will be one atom left, to placate the dreary vacuum,
 One molecule grappled by cell-counts sloughed and scrambled,
  Tissue rent asunder, organs corroded, soul's debris abandoned -
And I will wear the blue-blue, I will wear the overcoat and ring,
 Carnelion round my neck, magnetite across my throat, and singing -
  Your name - as I am torn asunder, the fifteen dreary words,
The ten lost and forlorn colors, the fifteen dying notes,
 The ten corroded sites - you Blue-Blue, wear my overcoat -
  You Blue-Blue wear my ring - placate my death with dreary yours -
What a vacuum here, and souls of dying atoms split asunder
 Stumble just beneath you Blue-Blue, taking me abandoned -

well now we have two posts---juliana's and kent's---which in many ways are
oppositionally aligned, insofar as their approach to the "content" of this
list goes (what it should be, whether it should be controlled in any way,
etc.)... i suppose i don't have to note, as well, that juliana is a woman
(a fact re which she makes direct reference) and kent is a man...

i'm reminded of the fascist vs. anarchist debates in italy... only reminded
though...

one additional issue that needs to be brought to the fore here:  one of the
reasons we're struggling of late is that this medium has brought us all
together in some unprecedented ways... yes, the issue of medium---i won't
belabor it here, but the public-private dimension of this list constitutes
in some ways a direct challenge to print practices, incl. perhaps the
editorial function that charles is trying, in my view is trying at some
pains, to institute (and i'm not "accusing" or "blaming" charles
here---i've no doubt he's doing his best)...

we're stuck (in the sense i long ago came to appreciate via pirsig's _zen
and the art of motorcycle maintenance_), and the only way out of our
stuckness, i think, will be to find a way to make for infrequent,
real-time, up-front moderation (much as self-moderation/regulation
currently works in collective terms)... but i'll leave it to charles, as
listowner, to listen to what we're all busy telling him (front &
backchannel) and weigh in here with what he thinks we
can/should/might/oughtta do...

best,

joe

Your segue into your poetics, to my mind, is perfectly legitimate. If
your brief theoretical disquisition seems somewhat forced in order to
conform to the set of preceding posts, well, then we've all done that
from time to time in order to be a part of one discussion or another.
Your subject matter is beyond reproach even if your aesthetic does not
conform to the fundamental bias of this list.---Carlo Parcelli

        We hope that you can join us for a poetry reading on Saturday,
December 12 at 7:30 p.m. at the Ruthless Grip Art Project (1508 U Street
NW, on U Street near the corner of 15th, beside the big black sign!) for a
poetry reading by LISA SAMUELS and ROD SMITH.


        Much to the amazement of everybody who noticed it here in D.C.,
LISA SAMUELS' first book-length collection of poems, SEVEN VOICES (O
Books) received a glowing (if short) review recently in the Washington
Post, making it pretty much the first non-mainstream poetry collection
ever to be reviewed in the Post, as far as anyone around here seems to
know. But everybody should read the book anyway! Sophisticated and
philosophical, SEVEN VOICES offers a highly theoretical, yet still
emotionally engaged, look at the contemporary condition of language and
the world that language both makes and can't quite find.

        ROD SMITH is the author of a number of books of poetry, including
IN MEMORY OF MY THEORIES (O Books) and THE BOY POEMS (Buck Downs Books).
He is also the editor of AERIAL magazine, whose forthcoming issue on the
work of Bruce Andrews forms the backdrop of an interchange between Rod and
Bruce in the most recent issue of PHILLY TALKS. Once called by Connie
Deanovich a "New York School Poet in Language Poetry clothing," Rod's work
is actually far more unique and surprising than such a label suggests--but
it's still a pretty funny thing to say, anyway.


        We hope to see you there and for all festivities afterwards.

I'm sorry to hear the Henry Gould has left the list; I've had my fair
share of conflicts with him, and, even when I'd been lurking and
disengaged from most of the debates on the list, I still welcomed his
voice.

Have been reading Lyn Hejinian's _The Cold of Poetry_, which is my first
real forary into the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets. I'm working on a feature for
the arts magazine here on "metaphysical" poets (beginning with Eliot's
notion in his lectures), and the piece has been widening its scope step by
step until I decided that one useful thing I might do is try to bring a
writer (Lyn) into the discussions that happen around the campus, which
usually center around a resolute conservative position. The basic idea --
that much of what is considered poetry today is a simple concatenation of
aphorisms about suburban life, sometimes widened into a "multicultural"
domain.

I began considering the piece when I realized the strange dead feeling
that came over me when I read so much of the "approved" poetry of recent
years; once upon a time, reading opened avenues into new experience. Now,
so much of what is written seems to be a series of anguished reworkings of
what is always around. Reading the _Cold of Poetry_, I realized how much I
had been missing simply because I had "gotten too good" at reading, say,
the Confessionals -- which is partly my fault, but partly, I think,
theirs.

In other news: I'm beginning the ground work for a paper on notions of
beauty in an urban context (it's actually for Elaine Scarry's class that
came up for discussion here a few days ago). Is there anybody on the list
that can point to some interesting works on urban space? There is,
unfortunately, so much bad work out there in this field that I feel I need
a Virgil to guide me to useful starting points.

I was wondering if anyone could, in public or in private, explain to me
what exactly the "Abstract French Lyric" or the "French Abstract Lyric"
is? I hear rumors of its existence, but no one has ever grabbed me by the

i find it a sad commentary on the state of this list that we get Rachel
Blau DuPlessis out of her erasing-frenzy to respond to a thread with
some serious potential, and yet, not one post in reply. Perhaps we
should have another round of "Free Henry"-- as that seems to be what
keeps people going around here.  I would like to cite a passage from
Rachel's post and throw it back into the mix, as I think it warrants
further attention:

"... The trauma of amnesia and the trauma of remembering, witnessing are
intertwined for me. My interest did not begin "textually" (that is
solely as a question of rhetoric, representation, or formal interests)
tho it takes shape textually. There is (for me) no sense of textuality
as a value in a vacuum; making texts, and alluding to textual stuff
(like black pages, or glosses) is absolutely linked to depths of ethical
and social and poetic feeling."

it would be good to hear further elaboration as to what is meant by this
statement. Obviously we don't live in isolation, nor in a vacuum. I
would be curious to hear of instances of poetic value which assert
themselves as such-- i.e. as without regard to externalia in this day
and age; and perhaps more importantly, how do the various poets and/or
critics on this list see/ or solve the issues raised by questions of
erasure. I am thinking, initially, of Susan Howe's *Eikon Basilike* and
the resolution of such by "making the dead walk again" ... more from
Rachel, whose work on Susan and others has been at the fore, would be
much appreciated...

I'm a little behind the eight ball on this one, what with all my demanding
but oh so rewarding work on the Rules Committee.  But I love the list when
it lists, and listens.

Dodie Bellamy--Letters of Mina Harker.  Picked this up as a result of all
the glowing recommendations from various listmembers.  And it does glow,
like a radioactive isotope.

Nicholson Baker--The Size of Thoughts, Essays and other Lumber.  Baker is
a bit wonkish sometimes but also brilliant, funny, & one of the master
practictioners of the sentence writing today (though maybe not the *new*
sentence).  Of special interest to list-types are two wonderful essays,
one on the history of punctuation and another on the demise of the card
catalog system.
I went into the latter essay thinking about how the old card catalogs
always gave me a stiff neck, and remembering that you couldn't log in from
home back in the days, but B. makes a damn good case that the destruction
of these catalogs to make way for on-line systems has been an atrocity.
(He's not saying we shouldn't have gone on-line, but he's pissed that
libraries simply dumped & destroyed the old catalogs, and he points out
both some lost virtues of the old system and some serious flaws in the new
one.  Might consider this one under the "erasure" thread.)


Humberto R. Maturana and Francisco J. Varela--The Tree of Knowledge:  The
Biological Roots of Human Understanding.  Weird neurobiologists from
Chile.

The O. Henry Awards Prize Stories, Best of 1997.  The Prize Jury for this
one was Louise Erdrich, Thom Jones, & David Foster Wallace.  Some
too-familiar formulas here & there, but also some pretty  good stories,
including the first-prize winner by Mary Gordon, and one that made it in
from Conjunctions by Rick Moody.  I hadn't known either of these writers,
but it says in the back that Moody wrote the novel The Ice Storm.  I'm
assuming that this is the novel the movie was based on, but don't know for
sure.  Anyway, I liked the movie--anyone read the book?

This is in response to Juliana Spahr's tentative suggestion that the list
could possibly become a more restricted forum limited to the posting of
announcements, etc.

I'd just like to point out that that's all most of us are apparently on the
list for, anyway. I know that my life became much easier once I started
deleting every message that didn't have the word "announcement" in its subject
line or wasn't written by someone who I know &/or whose opinions interest me.
I'm sure that I've missed an interesting thread or two, but I consider the
trade off to be worthwhile there.

Maybe folks announcing a reading, publication, or whatever could be sure that
the subject line for their message reflects this-- that way, those of us who
don't read each & every message would still know to actually read the
announcement...

Despite Mom's advice, ignoring the schoolyard bully didn't always work-- they
could still push you in the mud puddle & take your lunch money. Here, though,
the power is all in your "delete" command... use it wisely & use it often. &
remember, when it comes to the temptation to read the messages from the
pompous blowhards that you love to hate, just say no.

Subject:      Re: Erasing

     Erasure as both a poetic and a personal concern: There was a time in
     my writing when i wanted to pare down to the single luminous
     statement, to let the writing serve as much as a mark for what wasn't
     said or understood as for what was. I was influenced in this i think
     both by a sort of mystical catholic heritage, in which writing felt
     like a gestural ritual to evoke grace, pain, mystery, (but also a sort
     of domination and control), and by my thin adolescent knowledge of
     eastern writing, which seemed to me then to deal much with
     evanescence, the sparsity and insufficiency (and wonder) of our
     perceptions and of the thingness of things.

     Later i began to feel that it was more true to my own hyperactive,
     compulsively descriptive and analytical personality (a product of the
     culture i really grew in) to be more expansive, to catalogue and
     imagine via language how much muchness seemed to be, that the
     sparseness i was fascinated by was interior, more a product of how
     little i knew - being a writer seemed to imply facing some
     overwhelmingly indefinite variability.

     Today, it doesn't seem to me to be a choice between, as Pierre put it,
     fullness/unfolding and erasure/minimalism. It's the interplay of the
     two - which i think Rachel's work in the Drafts displays quite
     powerfully. Erasure as the outside (and other) to the folding and
     unfolding. Because erasure - loss - forgetting - elimination - is both
     dangerous and necessary.

     Erasure refers to the huge pit of absence that an event like the
     holocaust opens in history. Erasure is also a hazard to be faced -
     denial, forgetting, loss of history. But it is also true to the
     process of letting go of, for instance, prejudice or other sick habits
     of thought, confining codes, errors, the crippling power of trauma.
     Reinventing the self (and the social, and their respective languages),
     so necessary to continuance, involves selective forgetting.

     Much of what we do in poetry now, i think, is to represent such
     processes of transformation, loss and gain, but always in flux.
     Modernism's forward-thrust (make-it-new revolution, extincting the
     old) has given way to a spiral. (Not that this is unprecedented -
     Stevens' poem as act of the mind, ye olde stream-of-consciousness
     etc.) Many of us work on non-linear models to call up the ways that
     thought, perspective, representation, articulation double back on
     themselves, forget some things, repeat and recall others, bog down,
     calm down, agitate again, bifurcate, split, mark, break, erase, write.
     Little of interest is happening in still-lifes, static judgments.

     Yet we are haunted by those erasures, their smudges and tears. If it's
     all transformation, how do we judge our responsibilities (and ethical
     choices). Where does the forgotten go? How much of the etymology and
     how many past uses of a word lurk under its apparent surface and
     sound? The unspeakability of that haunting interrupts our accounts of
     interruption, pins them to their tracks, demands its own recognition.

     The mention of Retallack's ai/d/sappearance - alphabetic subtraction -
     also reminds of the Oulipo lipograms, esp. Perec's La disparition or
     (in English) A Void, in which the erased letter (E) from the
     vocabulary of the book also becomes the central point of the plot -
     everyone is looking for the thing that has been erased. While Perec is
     comic about it, mostly, the seriousness of the theme for Perec in
     postwar France is fairly evident.

     These seem inescapable writing issues, but Rachel's quite right I
     think to note this as a particularly end-of-this-century urgency. I'm
     curious how this approach to erasure, at least in tone, might change
     in 10 or 20 years.

Subject:      under and over erasure
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

It seems to me folks have pinpointed TWO levels of erasure, in responding
to Joanna's challenge...

1. erasure being mentioned, and woven, as an image/conceptual nexus,
into a poem;

2. the absence of words from blocks of space in the poem, as a formal and
structural dimension of the writing;

...the first seems exemplified by the passages from the Drafts Joanna
quotes; the second by the Tablets, as someone mentioned.

Then there was the poem by David Antin, whose form was skywriting.

Which brings up an interesting point.  I agree with a very early response
to JF, which mentioned the overwhelming universe of clotted and crowded
information/data/bricolage that characterizes contemporary subjective
experience....As tho poets were trying to clear away space, to speak (to
breathe!); but also as if they were apprehending the crush of info
overload and noise, as itself a form of erasure:  things fail to cohere
and are in effect lost because of the overburden of hyperactive and
disconnected "meanings."

But there's another source for erasing, which is a philosophical concern
with the reality of things, of activities, of poetry, of ideas.  This was
part of Antin's motivation, i would say.  I think that poets who have been
influenced to some degree by Buddhistic and similar traditions, would be
among those interested in erasure:  like the disappearing of the mind when
it realizes its own nonreality, in Buddhism, Taoism, etc.  ...the
achievement of nonself.

Unfortunately, i don't recall offhand a use of erasing modalities (of
either type) in the poets i know and like best, who were influenced by
these traditions:  Mac Low, Cage.

Kent Johnson might wish to speak to the general topic of
Buddhism-influenced poets and erasure (if i had read his magnificent
anthology as closely as it deserves, maybe i could come up with more)

The Atlanta poet John Lowther has spent time living in Asia, in part to
encounter and study these Eastern traditions.  He also counts Mac Low and
Cage (as well as Antin) among his primary interests and influences...He
has a long work in which he used Duchamp's random generated forms, called
"stoppages," to **erase** sections of prose from a number of books on
Duchamp's life and work....These are further worked, and the result is a
sequence of poems shaped and formed by useing *exclusion* or erasure as
**the primary poetic technique**,  in a sense.

Some of this work has just now appeared in Kenning 3.  More is going to
appear soon in Misc. Proj.

*** Canada co. pulls Jesus cellular ad

RED DEER, Alberta (AP) - An Alberta telephone company pulled a TV ad
featuring one of the Three Wise Men pitching cell phones to the baby
Jesus after receiving about 100 complaints. "We felt people felt
strongly about this religious issue and that it would be better to
withdraw the ads," said Arnie Stephens, vice president of marketing
for Telus Mobility, the company that canceled the ad Friday. The
commercial featured two of the Wise Men offering frankincense and
myrrh to a figure off-camera, presumably Jesus. Instead of offering
gold, the third Wise Man offers a deal on the phone company's prepaid
cell-phone plan. "We expected we would get some calls," Stephens
said. "The intensity of the feelings, that's something new to us."

I am not so much pissed for I do not mind the contention
but being young and lazy with books
I would like to read more about poetics
and poetry
but Poetics not only describes behavior
between poets


The poets like to show what they know
as well as what they feel

Sometimes you put your neck out

in the world in text

and ex-pect

(or ate) it

to come back.

Rachel, I don't think this is solely a "girl" thing as suggested
of intimidation tho some of it
but it is a community (person/s) that comes with communal dynamics
including checks and balances, desires/endeavors/skeletons, never clear cut,
fluxuating though topics creep up and die (deleting ...)
This one wins this time
tho for a Tirade, a long one
and yes, I wish it would move on a bit, not back, so I can lurk and learn
and hear poets talk about other poet products
and one day
speak.


Thanks Rachel.

Yes but this is the 'chance' of vivisection. Because though the
permutations possible from throwing the yarrow (sic?) sticks is very
high, it is still finite and therefore not truly random or subject to
chance. Jacques Monod in Chance and Necessity tries to make an
'ontological' case for discrete operations but falls back on the throw
of dice as a metaphor with banal philosophical results. The same
misinterpretation occurs throughout the physico-philosophical literature
e.g. Max Born, early Quine, all of the Vienna Circle excepting the
divine Herr Wittgenstein who was really not a member, and Logical
Postivism. The sticks or the die contain their own discretion (e.g.
discrete) or limitation but as Kant or Schopenhauer would say only for
the thrower e.g. the perceiver. This takes us back to Heidegger who
strongly insists that attributing a process that is fundamentally a
product of Dasein e.g. 'being in the world' to 'being' throuugh Dasein
comes to its knowing contributes to the existential dislocation that he
relates to the modern technological condition. The 'flowering out' of
Cage's best work comes from these limitations or discretions and are
accorded an aesthetic and not an ontological status as a result. Erasure
here can operate successfully precisely because there is an upper
bound---acknowledged or not. The misuse of the words chance and
randomness are unfortunate, but probably no more so than they are in
complexity or chaos theory. The mathematician, G.H. Hardy, once said,
"Rigor is what Littlewood [his assistant] and I call gas." The double
meaning is both true of the physical nature of gasses and scatalogical
in order to illustrate that too much must not be made of this
nature.---Carlo Parcelli

Argh.  I'm trying to catch up with the List crises and there are many
holes in my understanding but want to pitch in.  Like the rest of you I
have much to eulogize about the list.  If it weren't for the list I
would have remained aesthetically isolated in Boulder.  I would not have
made correspondence with Patrick Pritchett, Hoa Nguyen, Alan Sondheim,
Renee Gladman, David Bromige and many others which has been one lynchpin
of of my poetic home.  And for all the other reasons mentioned, quick
info, publishing, audience, obviously, this list is crucial.

I think we slam Charles Bernstein way too quickly with charges of
censorship.  In fact I was on an alternative, selective list for a
little while and got off because I found it too internal, found the
dialogue to self-reflective and self-conscious/polite/uniform.  Betsy
Andrews call Poetics the "populist" list, and I agree with her.
Obviously its keepers are doing something right.

But it does get bogged down with vituperative and personal rants and
repartee.  This stuff effects the list's ratio of usefulness/interest
to  time consumption demanded and narrows the scope of debate.  Granted
I've been in my own world for several months but there wasn't much on
the list that was energetic except a sort of tit for tat.

I appreciate Juliana's suggestion that it be limited to exchange of
information but we will then lose that occasional gem of a thread that
grabs even the most sleuthful lurker and puts them on the screen.

I am a member of the Park Slope Food Coop here in Brooklyn.  Like the
list it is shopping for members only but membership is absolutely open
and available to everyone.  If you can't afford the $100 deposit, you
can pay as little as you can and accrue the deposit over as long as it
takes.  There is childcare and special memberships for folks with
special needs.  There are over 3,000 members and so, of course working
together to run the store is a challenge.  The way the challenge is met
is that every problem is answered by a policy, approved of by the
membership.  Clearly, some policies are repugnant to some people, for
example, that you must show your empty bags before buying your food to
prevent intentional and unintentional theft.  And I have one friend who
gets angry every time--but her overall feeling of gain makes her have to
go along.

I've been as annoyed as anyone by both this list and the food coop but
in my world, these attempts of vastly diverse people to get together and
create something, that is better than malls and disney, merits sticking
to it.

As an activist I've come to have a policy of always placing my
appreciation of what a person is doing above my critique, if possible.
I've also stated on this list that I've been in a position to censure
someone in the effort to maintain a tone that allows for diverse
community.  A generous assessment of Charles Bernstien's motives for
trying to manage some particularly present voices, is that he is trying
to maintain a balance.

Proposal:
Can a letter, approved of my this list, be sent each month to the five
big posters automatically--not to judge the content of their post, just
to let them know they've been particularly visible that month and they
may want to give five others a chance to be particularly visible the
next month?  With this letter of reminder, perhaps loud mouths (I am
one, no?) could regulate themselves?

Again, I want to urge us to save this list.  There is no good reason as
far as I can tell, to self-destruct.

yours truly,
Rachel Democracy Levitsky

subscriber going back *many months*. We have written to this subscriber
numerous times in the past. For example, near the end of March of this year,
the subscriber was informed that while the two other most frequent posters=
 had
27 messages, or an average of one per day, his were already at twice that
number (total for that month alone: 61).  I could go on detailing this
correspondence but I haven't because I considered it private. At a certain
point, you realize that polite requests for cooperation are not working. I
think those who want to turn this matter into something ideological are
doing a
great disservice to all the people involved here.=20

The choice we made was the best option we had if we were indeed serious=
 about
keeping limits on postings. Going back to Kent Johnson=92s accusation, one=
 might
wonder how even such a formidable crew as those of at Poetics List Central
could have known, before the end of November, what the total posts would be
for
this month. We are not clairvoyant. Kent Johnson chose not to consider the
more
obvious conclusion that the total posts for November might have been=
 different
if we had not ever so politely asked a couple of our beloved frequent=
 posters
to observe an often repeated list ground rule about overposting to the
list. As
it happens, all of the amazing (I think) four people in the history of the
list
we have ever written to gently request that they might consider=
 consolidating
their posts have been written to because -- I realize it defies belief --=
 they
were  -- stop for a second to take this in --  *posting too much*, more than
anyone else. NOT THE CONTENT OF THEIR POSTS!  If a subscriber to the list
makes
unambiguously manifest that she or he has no intention of abiding by the=
 basic
ground rules of the list, then those responsible -- not only *to* the list=
 but
*for* the list, I would add -- need to act fairly and generously but also
decisively. This is no more than a clich=E9 of List Management 101.=20

>He and Gabe Gudding-- Gudding =85 have
>been told (and I ask to be corrected if I'm wrong), that their posts
>are to now be reviewed and judged before they may appear.=20

You are wrong. Gabriel Gudding's subscription status has never been changed
and
his ability to post to the list directly is the same as all 600 plus current
list subscribers. In future, you might want to ask Joel or me before posting
such misinformation to the list. In your Sunday post you also claimed that
Henry Gould had be "86d" from the list. This is also wrong, as anyone=
 reading
my post from Friday would be aware.=20

*

There was no improper relation.

I did not ask anyone to lie.

The assumption that those of us who are spending considerable time and=
 energy
providing this service are somehow guilty of something -- let=92s assume tha=
t
and
find the crime later! -- seems to me, um, er, counter-productive. (But I=
 know:
Tis far nobler to tear down those institutions we=92ve established than find
ways
to support them.)

*

I realize I have an apology to make to the list. Many of those who were most
active on this list, and most cared about it, have urged me to do something=
 to
make it readable, and make it habitable, again. They spoke of the list being
dominated by a few men (yes gender is an issue) whose tone tended to be=
 harsh
or scolding and that when they did post their posts were either ignored or
treated derisively. They responded to my inaction has been to leave the
list or
stop reading it.=20

Their contributions are very much missed.=20

But no fanfare was made about these folks, who felt very much pushed out by
the
volume of posting, by the often hectoring tones of many posts on this list=
 and
also what they described to me, over and again, as the squandering of the=
 list
space by posts that would have been better sent backchannel. I hesitated to
act, for one thing because I was committed to having the list be as=
 minimally
moderated as possible -- and for this I probably should be held accountable,
even censured. But I also knew that even the tiniest amount of editorial
intervention on this list, on the most unassailable grounds, and in strict
compliance with the stated policies of the list in the Welcome Message,=
 would
be subjected to a firestorm of protest.=20

*

The fact is -- I realize again this must be shocking to a few of you  --=
 that
*no post has ever been censored on this list* and that the only complaints=
 we
have received about censorship concern those who post more than anyone else=
 on
the list. There is an irony here if you want to find it.

*

The few men who post most frequently on this list, who dominate the
discussion,
are not the ones being silenced.

*

Like several others who have recently address this issue, my concern about=
 the
list is not focused exclusively on the needs and rights of those who want to
post in an unlimited way. Rather than lament that one person, who has posted
more to this list, I suspect, than anyone in the history of the list, has
chosen to leave the list rather than restrict the number of his posts, I
lament
the dozens and dozens of people who have told me they felt pushed off the=
 list
by the exactly the problems that we have been trying to address in the past
few
weeks, by exactly the hubris expressed in several recent posts: that to post
more than anyone else, to try to dominate the tone of the list, the psychic
release involved in being belligerent -- is an  unimpeachable right and that
anyone who tries to interfere with that right will be defamed in one way or
another. People rarely make list announcements about the signing off the=
 list
of this *legion of =93others=94*, or publicly laments their absence, but=
 each of
these departures has been as important as the one resignation that has been
focused on recently.

*

The tendency a very few list members to assume and broadcast the worst about
the minimal list moderation that we do is, perhaps, expectable. However, it=
 is
not only my sense but also the strongly voiced opinion of most people I=
 speak
to that the list needs more editing not less -- *surely, some people have
other
ideas about lists*, but the point is not necessarily to always follow the
least
line of resistance, although that would certainly make for less flak.=20

Indeed, as I=92ve noted,  I have been inundated with complaints by one=
 person
after another that if the editors of the list can't create a better and more
readable environment, people will stop reading it.  Of course, there are
others
ready to replace them, who don't share these concerns -- that may be the=
 heart
of the issue -- whose list is it? It seems only common sense that you won't
see
multiple posts from people who find it an inhospitable place to post because
they are most likely to shy away from the predictable stock responses out of
the macho training camp: if they can't take it let them unsub, if they can't
stand the heat let them keep quiet,  how dare they censure my right to
speak by
questioning me, etc. The real sympathy must go to those "bad boys" who show
their mettle by refusing to respond to even the most reasonable requests of
the
list editors. I have a fairly thick skin, but not thick enough. I hope my=
 skin
never gets that thick.

*
In any case, the idea that most people support the abdication of any
editing or
moderation of the list is exactly the opposite of what I hear -- it's that
idea
of what the list is that has driven away more people than I care to name.
We --
and it's not just me -- are committed to making editorial and indeed=
 aesthetic
judgments as an integral part our list ownership: that is the foundation for
the list. Such judgments mean making choices with which some people, even=
 very
vocal people, will disagree with. That's reasonable and understandable. *But
our choices are not arbitrary or motivated by the desire to suppress any one
tone or point of view, but rather to foster an environment which will enable
greater participation.*

The editors of the Poetics List make very few editorial suggestions
directly to
subscribers: it almost never happens. In the history of the list this has
occurred maybe three or four times to check extended =93chat=94, maybe a=
 couple of
times to reconsider =93tone=94, and the few instances of asking folks to
consolidate messages, already mentioned. For myself, I have been  reluctant=
 to
post critical remarks about other posts on the list because I felt, as list
owner, that such remarks might take on more significance than I would=
 intend.
That is, for all these years I have avoided making any unnecessary
interventions on this list *of any kind* -- front channel or back channel.=
=20

*

In my experience, the Poetics List has been among the most open poetry
institutions I have encountered. In one sense, it is not as open as a
newsgroup
or an chat list because some constraints are put in place. Without these
constraints, however, the range and depth of contributions would be, I
believe,
diminished; many of the people on this list would depart post haste, and
without fanfare. Nor would there be anyone now involved willing to maintain
the
list. The openness of the Poetics List is a product of its mission, as=
 stated
in the Welcome Message in terms both aesthetic and structural. So it is
openness is framed by the terms of the specific project for which it was
designed. I mistyped something in my last post, so let me rewrite it now: in
the age of the Internet, I believe more editing not less is required. Those
who
are philosophically against moderated or edited or private lists should
work to
create the kinds of lists they want and show those of us who are skeptical
that
we are wrong. But debunking this list for its editorial commitments seems
to me
misguided and does not serve the cause of openness. This list cannot fulfill
all the desires for all who would like to be its members. No list can. Yes,
this list reflects my editorial, philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic
judgments, tastes, predilections, commitments. Anyway I hope it does, as
best I
can make it. I have asked too many people to hang in with this list (in too
many cases unsuccessfully), too many people to join the list, too many=
 people
to take the chance to post something, etc., for that not to be the case.=20

*

Do to my own time limitations, I cannot spend all the time some of the=
 people
on this list seem to need to respond to questions of list management. For
example, I will not be able to spend much more time this week on the list=
 and
will be away from any computer access for part of the week. Changes in the
list
management are in process, and as soon as these can be finalized, we will=
 get
back to you. In the meantime, I hope all of you will understand that my time
for this project has simply run out.=20

I must admit I'm one of the lurkers, and I was one of the digest folks, to
boot.  I think I did it for two reasons.  I didn't think I could resist the
temptation to read each and every post I was receiving throughout the day at
work.  So, I signed up as a digest reader.  This allowed me the opportunity to
get acquainted with the scope and the discourse of the list.  I also
understand
the I wasn't getting as much as I could out of the list by not entering the
dialogue.  But, I believed that I need a bit of an education or that I should
take the cotton out of my ears and stuff it in my mouth as an orientation.  I
also realized it became difficult to respond when I read the digest each night
on the way home from work, and I would miss many of the weekend posts.  I
still
miss the weekend posts.  Reading the digests, however, has been a good
education for me, and I have learned a great deal about things I never
considered when it came to poetry.

The recent banter has been educational as well.  I, for one, miss Henry
Gould's
posts and wish he'd come back.

Yesterday, I switched back to mail poetics rather than digest.  And, it
appears
that no one has posted in almost 24 hours.  This post may be more of a test
than anything else.

Open ended question:  Why do the poets on this list write poetry?

Bromige is a genius--but then I always almost knew that. Iteacher.n my
overquick memory/thinking abt that novel, I considered the political story
in its broad parodic swipe as the main show, and had never thought that
long about the love story, seeing it as just one of many human aspirations
shown to be battened but still seeping. But Brom is right. The love story,
and its limits and "betrayal" a terrif centre of the book. Thanks, ol'

        JUSTICE FOR JOSE SANTOS
STOP INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE IN NYC JAILS

   *Tuesday, Dec. 8, 1998, 5:30 - 7:00 pm*
      Dept. of Corrections/60 Hudson St.
        (1,2, A trains to Chambers St.)


Jose "Rolow" Santos was murdered by Rikers Island
correction officers on June 9, 1997.  The killing
was covered up as a "suicide" by the NYC Dept. of
Corrections.

An independent autopsy revealed injuries inconsistent
with suicide and consistent with violence--violence
which witnesses say started in a confrontation
with correction officers in the visiting room the
day before Jose Santos's death.

Ever day, the number of young people, overwhelmingly
young Blacks and Latinos, that are imprisoned grows.
Like police brutality on the outside, violence in NYC
prisons at the hands of correction officers has
escalated to the point that the city was recently
forced to settle a federal lawsuit for assault
and murder against prisoners.

The Santos family, which has joined other families
fighting police abuse, urges you to join them.  Their
son, like thousands of others awaiting trial on
Rikers Island, was supposed to be INNOCENT UNTIL
PROVEN GUILTY.  But brutal guards, protected by
a brutal system took away his rights and his life.

 Simon,
When I think of the concept of beauty of in urban places, I think of graffiti.
Now, Im not going to bother to defend this view to those that would say that
graffiti is an act of destruction with my view that acts of destruction have
with in them the seeds of creation,
except to say that these works have a definite voice, and it should be
considered.

Thank you for posting what you did.  I have seen verbalizing as an
important element in resolving trauma in my work (as psychologist).  In
my work as poet I have felt an impulse to obscure or obliterate what
I've said for some time (going so far at times as incorporating visual
work that covers the text.  I suspect that all these are related.

Errr, Joel, one of the problems is that posts are not getting thru; one
lengthy post of mine was sent yesterday and resent a couple of hours ago
and it has not been posted on the List...

Now while it was before Rachel's post and therefore doesn't respond to
her, it's a very substantive post on the erasure thread...Hasn't anything
to do with freeing Henry or the List thread.  Why has it not appeared?
you can hardly snipe at list members for not posting, when we are posting
and the posts aren't getting thru!

(if my post appeared to others, i apologize for this querulous plaint!
But it hasn't appeared here, and i am set to receive my own posts to this
list, and always in the past have...)

Dear Simon, etc.,

For what it's worth, it's pretty fascinating to read _The Cell_ after
reading TCOP's "The Composition of The Cell."  I have no idea which came
first--a lot of the material in each is the same (or a resemblance: a
draft? a backdraft?); *logically*, I suppose "The Composition" would come
first, as it seems more like notes for things that eventually ended up in
the book-length sequence _The Cell_.  And *logically*, I suppose _The
Cell_ would come first, for one could only speak of its composition after
the fact--or (it might break one's back) simultaneously.  Then there's the
joke that "The Composition of The Cell" doesn't necessarily refer to the
composition of _The Cell_.

Which brings me to the fact that no one, at least publicly, replied to
Maria Damon's query about the composition process of LH's _My Life_.
While a whole slew of people replied (and some, excuse this, incorrectly)
to MD's question about Stein's rose.  I'd be interested in hearing the
"answer" to the "composition of _ML_" query frontchannel, for one.
Perhaps this could kick off the discussion/s Joel K. suggested not too
long ago--on female "experimental" poets that are going to be either
present or discussed, I unfortunately forget which (both?), at an upcoming
conference (name of which I don't remember either)...

Also, Simon, do, if possible time-wise, read LH's _My Life_ (and all the
rest, but there's a point here).  Read it because you've been reading
"confessional" poetry.  Strangely, maybe (and I'm afraid perhaps <?>
offensively to the poet, yet with the utmost admiration), I often find
Hejinian to have  rescued/challenged/subverted and continued to work with
"confession" or "confessional poetry."  I also often think of Stein as a
confessional poet, without all the freight of the Confessional Poetry
lowelly "movement" entering into my thinking the words "confessional poet."  I
guess what I mean is that I find it interesting that, when reading the
poems of Confessional Poets, I feel like I'm coming up against a wall--not
hearing anything "confessional" or intimate, but something quite to the
contrary.  Whereas I find much of Hejinian's & Stein's work what I'm
ashamed to call, but must for lack of better words-'n-smarts, unbelievably
intimate, beyond "confessional" & "personal"...I suppose because it's
beyond "speech"--doesn't attempt to pass for something whispered or
wailed, as does Confessional Poetry.  At any rate, I couldn't comfortably
call either one of them L=A=N=G poets...

On the "girls v. boys" issue, gotta post an (old, old) poem here quickly:

Strap-On Canon

His feet are too clean
for my hair.

Just throw
the ball of wool, I'll clap

I don't know French, so I am probably the best person to answer your
query.

The "abstract French lyric" is by Pierre Reverie.

The "French abstract" lyric is an academic piece, a song about a list of
articles either in French or on French.

Can the "Abstract" French "Lyric" can cut the mustard?

Le lyric abstruit Fran-swa?  C'est moi!

However, there is also the possibility of Isidore Isou, the Romanian
(naturellement) inventor of Le Poesie Lettriste, who wrote "in French"
to the extent that lettriste poesie would be in a language.

It is possible that Andy Britain also wrote a French abstract lyric.


As we say in Russia, "etot vsou"

As I courageously emerged from the closet and blandished my own "advisory
notice" to the list, and solicited replies to 5 questions relating to
censorship / moderation (which everyone has ignored: is it that delete

Furthermore, as the FIRST to bring this censorship issue to your screens
on this List, folks, I do want to claim my ignoble laurels.  Henry, Gabe,

   Hey, re Chris McCreary's point (and Juliana's?)
       that we should restrict the list to ANNOUNCEMENTS,
         I say "bland, bland, bland!"
      I much rather agree with Joel Kuzsai of taking things
      such as the poem RBDP posted and addressing things it raises...
         That takes more time, which I will have when
              I'm unemployed in 10 days and counting....
                 (assuming they don't take my account away),

Thanks to Joel K. for his pushing on this.

I was also interested in Blau duPlessis' description of her memory as
porous and what this says about a notion of self as it plays out in the
work; erasing not as willed but inescapable.  (Which describes me fairly
well.)

Both also raised the huge issue of language/world vis-a-vis ethics, and
perhaps the lack of response is because this subject is so enormous and
humbling.  I would like to encourage short, tentative posts on this --- no
need to attempt completeness.

     i agree completely; the same theme broke my own busy-deleting-finger
     habit - but i *did* post in reply and after two attempts it strangely
     hasn't come through. i'll make a final effort and, again, apologies to
     anyone who receives this twice.

     * * *

     Erasure as both a poetic and a personal concern: There was a time in
     my writing when i wanted to pare down to the single luminous
     statement, to let the writing serve as much as a mark for what wasn't
     said or understood as for what was. I was influenced in this i think
     both by a sort of mystical catholic heritage, in which writing felt
     like a gestural ritual to evoke grace, pain, mystery, (but also a sort
     of domination and control), and by my thin adolescent knowledge of
     eastern writing, which seemed to me then to deal much with
     evanescence, the sparsity and insufficiency (and wonder) of our
     perceptions and of the thingness of things.

     Later i began to feel that it was more true to my own hyperactive,
     compulsively descriptive and analytical personality (a product of the
     culture i really grew in) to be more expansive, to catalogue and
     imagine via language how much muchness seemed to be, that the
     sparseness i was fascinated by was interior, more a product of how
     little i knew - being a writer seemed to imply facing some
     overwhelmingly indefinite variability.

     Today, it doesn't seem to me to be a choice between, as Pierre put it,
     fullness/unfolding and erasure/minimalism. It's the interplay of the
     two - which i think Rachel's work in the Drafts displays quite
     powerfully. Erasure as the outside (and other) to the folding and
     unfolding. Because erasure - loss - forgetting - elimination - is both
     dangerous and necessary.

     Erasure is awareness of the looming absences events such as Holocaust
     create. Erasure is also a hazard to be faced - denial, forgetting,
     loss of history. But it is also true to the process of letting go of,
     for instance, prejudice or other sick habits of thought, confining
     codes, errors, the crippling power of trauma. Reinventing the self
     (and the social, and their respective languages), so necessary to
     continuance, involves selective forgetting.

     Much of what we do in poetry now, i think, is to represent such
     processes of transformation, loss and gain, but always in flux.
     Modernism's forward-thrust (make-it-new revolution, extincting the
     old) has given way to a spiral. (Not that this is unprecedented -
     Stevens' poem as act of the mind, ye olde stream-of-consciousness
     etc.) Many of us work on non-linear models to call up the ways that
     thought, perspective, representation, articulation double back on
     themselves, forget some things, repeat and recall others, bog down,
     calm down, agitate again, bifurcate, split, mark, break, erase, write.
     Little of interest is happening in still-lifes, static judgments.

     Yet we are haunted by those erasures, their smudges and tears. If it's
     all transformation, how do we judge our responsibilities (and ethical
     choices). Where does the forgotten go? How much of the etymology and
     how many past uses of a word lurk under its apparent surface and
     sound? The unspeakability of that haunting interrupts our accounts of
     interruption, pins them to their tracks, demands its own recognition.

     The mention of Retallack's ai/d/sappearance - alphabetic subtraction -
     also reminds of the Oulipo lipograms, esp. Perec's La disparition or
     (in English) A Void, in which the erased letter (E) from the
     vocabulary of the book also becomes the central point of the plot -
     everyone is looking for the thing that has been erased. While Perec is
     comic about it, mostly, the seriousness of the theme for Perec in
     postwar France is fairly evident.

     These seem inescapable writing issues, but Rachel's quite right I
     think to note this as a particularly end-of-this-century urgency. I'm
     curious how this approach to erasure, at least in tone, might change
     in 10 or 20 years.

I'm proud to announce that my first book of poetry is now out from Meow Press:

_The Qualms of Catullus & K-mart_ by Don Cheney

27 poems from the full length work.

The poems were selected by Bill Luoma and the cover drawing was done by
Rose Anne Raphael.

Here are some reader comments on _The Qualms of Catullus & K-mart_:

"You and Zukofsky are a 1,2 punch out Catullus." James Sherry

"I'm a big fan of your Catullus translations. You're a fucking genius."
Juliana Spahr

"Your Catullus is truly great. I read it once a day to ward off the
demons." Bill Luoma

"I like it a lot, so ill and so urbane." Stephen Rodefer

"The Qualms of Catullus & K-mart is delightful.  That's a decision I
reached after I got used to the language, which I then began to enjoy
thoroughly - the quirky, surprising, incongruous, humorous diction -
Somehow the recurrence of those Roman names with their burden (in more
conventional texts) of solemnity in the midst of this modern-day idiom and
sometimes these Southern California images is very pleasing also." Lydia Davis

Emily, and, of course, all --

        The notion of Lyn Hejinian being somehow "more" than confessional
is interesting. The notion of hitting a wall in reading the trad.
confessionals is interesting: for me, there is an "aesthetic experience"
(i.e., I do think it's somehow poetic, and not simply a hashing out in
verse.) I understand your saying "I hit a wall", then, as the
aesthticization of hitting a wall. My problem with someone like, say,
Lowell, is not that I think his work is bad, but rather that I don't have
a taste for it in the end. I just don't really want to spend time in such
a resolutely "bipolar" language world, by which I don't intend to say that
someone who is psychophysiologically bipolar can only write in bipolar
language. I prefer the more polyvalent aspects of someone like Hejinian.
Someone like Plath, I think, belongs in a different category from the main
Lowell thread; her poetry is, to much, closer to Heijinan in the way it
has multiple nodes, multiple resting points. Plath is neither a whisperer
or a wailer in the way that Lowell is (or, more obviously, I think,
Berryman, who focuses his dream songs around that.)

        If it makes sense to talk "about" poetry at all, I guess. You're
right, of course, that I need to read more of Hejinian's work.

        I'm also interested in your statement that you couldn't
comfortably call either Stein or Hejinian a L=A=N=G. poet. What does it
mean, for you, for someone to be a L-poet? I approached Hejinian thinking,
OK, here's someone who is "in" this scheme, and a way for me to come to
know what the movement itself means. Is L-poetry constructed before the
poetry within it? Or is it just that someone else is more 'authetically' a
L-poet than H? I don't mean to raise the usual aporias about "well, these
are just terms, they mean what you want". How do you perceive H in
relation to more "normative" L-poets, and who might those be?

Question 1:
I am reading Arthur Sze--"Redshifting Web."  In that sequence he has
these three lines:

Instead of developing a navy, Ci Xi
ordered architects to construct a two-story
marble boat that floats on a lotus-covered lake

Does anyone know this story?  Who Ci Xi was?  How I might spell his name
to have more luck finding out who he was?  Where to look to find the
story?

Question 2:
In another part of the poem, he has this line: "as a lobster mold
transforms a russula into a delicacy."  What is a "russula"?  OED on
line was no help.

Question 3:
I have figured out what a redshift is (more or less).  Does anyone know
if there is such a thing as a redshifting web--astronomically,
cosmologically, referentially to the universe outside the poem--, or is
Sze writing to his poem?

Thanks

Charles:

You are the Listowner and you make decisions as you feel they
best serve the List as you understand its nature, purpose, and
function. You make that point clearly and I have no argument-- as
merely one of the hundreds who visit here-- with your right to run
the List in any way you choose. The List is private, as you say.

My concerns were offered in sincerity and good faith, out of a sense
that too heavy a hand was being applied to the situation you outline.
And while I _do not_, to say it again, feel you have been guided by
dishonorable motives in your recent decisions, nothing in your post
changes my opinion about the politics of the matter. In fact, to the
contrary.

Now, most people on the List seem fairly uninterested in the
controversy (as I rightly ascertained in my last post) so I will try
to be brief. Let me make just a couple of points, pausing here just
to say that if you choose to reply you may call me just "Kent" and
not "Kent Johnson," which repeated five times or so makes me feel
somewhat like a thing rather than a person...

So now my response:
You (unintentionally, I think) reveal, Charles, by going back to the
situation "over many months," that the perceived problem of post
volume coming from Henry Gould was actually getting better. Getting
better in November, it seems, by 100%. Why, then, was Henry placed on
"review" at a time when he seemed to be doing precisely what he was
being asked to do?

I want to say that I apologize if I misunderstood Gabriel Gudding and
misrepresented his situation to the List. You seem to be upset about
this, but it wasn't my intent to offer "misinformation" in speaking
of him as in the same category with Henry, and Gabriel can perhaps
elaborate separately on the nature of his communications with you.
But I was right, it appears from your comments, in asserting that
Henry's "subscription status" _was_ changed. I understand as well
that two of the three posts Henry submitted while he was on such
"special status" never appeared on the List. Because of your emphatic
assertion that "no post has ever been censored from this list," I
now assume that this must have been a technical glitch and had
nothing to do with any implementation of special conditions governing
Gould's "review" status. But I admit I felt concern about that when I
learned of it.

And I still feel concern, frankly, about the issue of censorship.
This does not mean that I feel _you_ see your editorial actions as
constituting such, but when you send a message reading

"You appear not to have been willing to reduce the frequency of
your posts despite the request made to you earlier in the week. Daily
posting is not an option. Please reduce your posts to no more than a
few each week."

to a person (Gabe Gudding) who is relatively new to the List and thus
has no history behind him of "over-posting," you in effect
selectively, and --according to my sincere evaluation of the
overall situation-- *because of matters of content,* remove a
privilege given publicly to all members of the List: a limit of five
posts per day, which to my knowledge no one has come close to
violating in any kind of systematic way. To my mind, candor behooves
one to acknowledge such intervention as *censorship,* whether one is
doing it for the perceived "greater good" or not. For when in a
community it is decided by someone who exercises a function of power
that a few are not permitted to say what they would like to say, when
they would like to say it, and in the form they would like to say it,
_when others are given the full privilege to do so_, it becomes
something akin to an opposition newspaper in a state-controlled
distribution system being allowed the "freedom" to publish, but only
with the supply of newsprint that the state has purposely and
emphatically curtailed for the sake of the "common good." The state
may well be benevolent and have the loftiest of goals, but it is
censorship de facto, with the de jure hanging unsaid like a sword
behind the screen. Why put someone under "review" if the threat of
a post's possible erasure is not there and ready to be wielded?

Of course, this is a Listserv to discuss poetics, not Nicaragua when
the Sandinistas were in power. But if I've helped make an issue of
the situation it's because I've come to adhere to that school of
head-in-the-clouds anarchist thought that believes that any
repressive measures against wayward voices have future and noxious
consequences that undermine the lofty vision one hopes to achieve.
I suppose I believe that in poetry as in poetics as in the
institutions enacted by "oppositional" poets for the democratic
promulgation of new forms and contents, form and content must be one,
or must be an interlocked figure, as someone once said, and that what
appears to be plain madness may actually, seen in an unexpected
light, prove to be a meaningful part, or, even stranger yet, prove to
be part of the ancient and exciting Vedic poetic tradition of
insult! Leaders of a community of poets searching wild and open
form, then, faced with situations of a wild and sudden irruption of
someone saying that other member's cocks and cunts, for example, are
not so fine as claimed (see George Thompson's wonderful post of
today) should not --in response to the scandalized "core
constituency" of the community-- so quickly say to the wild one that
daily posting is not an option; leaders may, rather, want to tell the
upset valued members who are complaining to please remember that
poetry and poetics is a wild, sometimes frustrating thing in its
overwhelming heteroglossia and that if you go away it's probably
going to be your loss. And please come back, if you change your mind.
We'll always be here.

This is more or less what I meant by being so presumptuous as to
suggest that it would have been simply best to allow each and
every member to post within the stated limits of five posts per day
without the threat of punitive measures. Rather than single some
people out and tell them that "daily posting is not an option," it
would be best to clearly remind those bothered that they can post the
same amount, delete any post with the undesirable name, or propose a
change in the List's governing rules for posts per day which the
Listowner will take into consideration. But never, in my
personal and perhaps overly idealistic opinion, no matter who the
person is who threatens to go away, should a leader say, OK, I'll put
this guy under special rules in the hopes that he'll change his tune.

But clearly, the decison has been made. I think this is long enough.
I will be leaving the List for a long time now. I have greatly
enjoyed being here, and I thank Charles, as I did before, for making
this space possible. But honestly, something I can't be a part of
seems to be happening.

Subject:      re The Cold of Poetry/Em's strand
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have shared your disappointment, finally, with the Confessional poets,
for exactly the same cause--they arent confessing much of interest. I am
tempted (ands am going to yield to this temptation) to reframe Bob
Grenier's "I Hate Speech" and write "I Hate Confessional Poetry." Just as
Bob meant (IMHO) "I hate the representation of speech as currently
practiced in poetry", so I dislike the representation of confessing,
etc.etc. I apologize, to myself first & foremost, for certain
generalizations here, but the Confessionals seldom break their frame, and
once you've decoded that, what is there to maintain interest? It is like
watching a wind-up doll bounce off the walls.

The Confessional poet I've probably read most, is Charles Bukowski. He's
not usually called that, but basically, thats what he is up to. I have read
a lot of his books because we shared a publisher, who would give me each
new Buke as it appeared.  I would take it home and devour it like a box of
chocolates, and then I would feel just as if that's what I'd done : guilty
of time-wasting, ashamed of my self-indulgence, and nauseous.

One objection along this "one-frame-monotony" trail, that I have, is the
convectication (if thats a word), the swollen image, of the poet who is
delivering the poem. So much comes to depend on his/her
life--"interesting"? "Old New England family"? "ex-beauty queen"?
"Bogart-cloned alcoholic sex-addict smoker"? Now, no one can help where
they come from, but I object where these arbitrary (to me) matters
dominate, where they substitute a "life" I cant assume, for a liveliness of
text which I can. (Such liveliness, say, as makes Plath readable, despite
her being a "Confessional"). [NB : I appreciate that there are groups who
value this or that poet as a welcome mouthpiece for hitherto-unaired
concerns. I am talking esthetics here, however, not message.]

Maybe some will be surprised that a poet as "personal" as I have been,
should feel this way. But (and here I feel especially in line with Emily
Lloyd) this interest is precisely why I find Confessional poetry
inadequate. Inadequate to personal life as I've known it; a masquerade of
personal life, painted mask, con job. Being alive is so much more various,
strobe not ditch. Or can be. Might be. Could be. Maybe I only write the
wish. Moreover, I see no need to always be pointing out that it is "I"
writing it. There's an author's name at the foot of the poem. How the heck
would a reader suppose those words had got there, on the page?

In Lyn's "My Life," while we glimpse much of her actual lifetime, what one
reads for (again, IMHO) are the sentences, their quality, their variety,
their intelligence--and their unpredictable juxtapositions, a non-sequitur
quality that keeps a reader on tiptoe.

*

Like many Listafarians, I am distressed and chastened by our recent
eventuations, reluctant to post at all yet wanting to help provide
something to chew on. I know I perpetrated some of what's been objected to
: tit for tat, and also that I have brought my silly-bugger side
front-channel, if to the amusement of some, then to the boredom and chagrin
of others. I shall try to rein these shadow-side emanations in. I hope
today's posting can keep a thread going, and that it doesnt appear that I
am pissing on someone's favorite plinth.

I have also wanted to post on the Erasure thread to the effect that erasure
is a subset of textual deformation, a process I see as inherent to poetry,
not just since the Romantics. Again, my position as a high-poster has held
me back. But perhaps Lisa Samuels could weigh in here, with news of her
project with Jerome McGann?  Erasure, for historical causes accurately
discerned by some posts to this thread, is a dominant mode in our century.
Had it not been, however, we should have had to invent another. IMHO.

I'm jumping in on this one, lurker that I've been. Some time ago I found
myself writing poems in which concrete nouns simply disappeared. Gone.
Couldn't conjure one up to save the day. I read Kristeva's Black Sun and
began to understand why. The strategy of Perec's book has a similar source
in the incapacity to grieve or to find adequate  expression for loss.

There are cultural and poltiical equivalents. Cliches that separate
modernists from post modernists say that pomos "embrace apoacalypse." Bah
humbug. Who isn't scared of the dark? As the chunks of ice fall away from
the arctic ice shelf who doesn't shudder in their quiet little bones?

That's because "the disappearing of the mind when it realizes its own
nonreality, in Buddhism, Taoism, etc.  ...the achievement of nonself" is
perhaps not the best way to put it.  The notion of emptiness --- each thing
is inherently empty of its own thingness --- is not about erasure.  The
mind realizing its own nonreality, so to speak, is then free to become full
of everything --- that's why the mirror analogy is used so often ("red
comes, red; white comes, white").  Traditional East Asian poetics
influenced by Buddhism and Taoism tends to focus very much on particular
things (I'm not talking about the philosophical stuff like, say, the Hsin
Hsin Ming or the Tao Te Ching) --- in haiku this is raised almost to a
fetish.

(Although I'm not a specialist in East Asian poetics, and perhaps there is
a tradition there of the sort Mark P. posits that isn't well known in the
U.S.)

(And thanks for telling us all about John Lowther's work.)

dear chalres, your courage as papabear keeps me going or i would have
quit this silly "community" long agao. i am so tired, man, of the sad
ness i reap from the ugliness on the list--and the spankings i get for
wanting it to be fruitful, meaning ful. or for thinkint that it is all
there is for me right now. san diego is cold, like a desert moon
circling a star with no center. our poetics family seems to have burnt
out and you tired paternal badboy on triel for obligoatory offenses.
sorry you have to take the blume.

i am lonely here and it is cold. my arthristis keeps my fingers in
statinary orbit around hungry keyboard.

i suspect things will happen faster now in manageamtn swtichover and the
bailure of juliana and our other lovely friends to hang in there speeds
up the creation of a new listserv syntax, which i will write to you
about after i have time to think about. the new co-manager must have an
iron gut; i dread the idea of going anywhere now and having to talk
about this mess, and just assume shove-off. from here this bale full of
wax i can see how quickly that would happen anyway, and i promise to
finish my disseration before the millenial purge.

and the idea of having to read another research paper on serial killers,
or how to care for lizards, ( i sswear)...... and yet i love teaching
and seeing progress in the most banal topics such as supporting
arugments and with good thesis statments and blahblahd blah ... i am
down. it has been a terrible week.  before i said i felt that I was
sendtenced to the slist and now i feel like i'm clinging to some family
unit represented by that forum  HOW PATHETIC -- fuck ideogloy. ! if
those morons only knew how little time there was for itogdldy.,
anyhow--------sorry to be so weepy. I have half a sixpack of beer in my
friedge and i am too frozen to go get aeven one bottle of it. meanwhile
imbeachment is like a subtle harpsichord, i cnnot play

i suggest you remove yourself as active owner and just be sponsor as we
discused and i will try to check in for everyday until holiday and mla
-- i will see you in san fran and we can exhanxcge secret hand-signals
as you wont recognize me with beard and cane...

anyhow......as i said....love,   j

i've been reading minus tides, the mag from the next island over, it's a
local situationist/surrealist literary political rag(no matter how often
the bourgeois drunken television reader says the 60s are over i suspect the
sixties are alive all over in the rural and there's an entire new
generation our kids with the same values do you find that tu autre
rurales?), it includes the work of another poet from nowhere, amanda hale,
whose work i couldn't say i like but it disturbs me passing emily
dickinson's test of making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up:

Homecoming

the undertaker has grown rich
solid flesh covers bone
the imprisoned maggot eats
its pathways through the soul

the city is full of vampires
swooping on the antennaed dark
banks of blood are changing
hands entire lives

a small clone screams
all genitals and mouth
impotent rage cribbed
in the parlour

sperm fruit conceived
on the embalming slab
soul still glimmering
on the gathering dark

I was thinking about erasure in the process of translating - in texts - but
also in the fact of someone who is exiled or leaves in choice their country
and adopts a new language what happens to their old - particularly people
whose language of orgin was representative of horrors etc

I want to second Rachel here. For me, the discussion is wonderful; a lot
of us are not part of any poetry community, and the chance to participate
here is vitally important. I value the announcements, but I also value
the talk.

It's remarkable that it has run so long without these problems.

I wish Henry would come back. I wish people would post a bit less. I don't
think there's a need for reminders to be sent to the top posters, but only
for everyone to be aware that it's a public list, much larger than the
number of posters would indicate.

Perhaps someone could write Henry. Perhaps we could all be grateful for
this space a bit.

seems to me that confessing as it is usually understood depends on language
that possesses coherence in the way that Langpo is thought not to. moreover,
the pizzazz of lowellian poetry (and yes the same can be said more or less
for plathian or berrymanian) is that the language is done up to suggest a
identifiable and thus somewhat unified or coherent "self" albeit perhaps
a self that is in pain because of its self-perceived fragmentation (like
the wicked witch of the west from a movie that is more or less contemporaneous?).

Rachel speaks of textuality linked to the depths of ethical and social and
poetic feeling -- to differentiate from a kind of abstract literary
fascination -- and I agree with her.  Treblinka was to be covered
over and made into a park.  So, then, what is the opposite of erasure?
Inscription?  Imposition?  Bloating up the void?  Being written down?  A
deep sense of presence?

Every blank page (every blank computer screen) writes over a past; every
time something is written, it blocks out something else, which is a kind
of erasure.  Every possibility ends possibilities.  While we usually
consider erasure as something to recover from, to re-inscribe -- such as
the erasure of whole peoples, of memories, of pasts -- there is another
aspect: erasure as a positive complement to inscription.

if you go back to juliana spahr's post, she suggested seperate list FOR
announcments, and other for the rest.  and she mentioned enjoying rest
beside announcements until she got way busy and clogged down, and sick of
recent spate of snarls.

finally, if you peruse posts going back a few weeks, you will see that
most lurker posts (and others) do NOT, as mr./ms. mccreary states, say
that they only like announcements.

i am not particularly happy to see namecalling, and the "schoolyard
bully" pejorative would, i think, have been better left unsaid.

but gabriel gudding-wise, i must point out a delicious irony: as a woman,
am too often treated to persons overendowed with entitlement who feel it
is encumbent upon them to "explain" what i have said, speak FOR me, and
in so doing, completely ignore what in fact i HAVE said.  i suspect that
the numerous people, lurkers and otherwise, who have been posting that
they like the multiplicity of posts, in addition to announcement posts,
are perhaps less than idyllic about having it "explained" that in fact
they were posting to say they only read announcements.  how quaint that
the interpretation is conjoined to disparagement of "schoolyard bullies."

i feel the same frisson of distaste about "schoolyard bully" taunt whether
i am, or am not, considered to be lumped among them.  how bully of me --

        sorry for my hasty notice for non response re: erasure & Rachel
this morning
--tired from grading papers
(I used to stay up all night writing papers
now I stay up grading them)

but I think non-response is silence is erasure is pavement

time to circle the mob (paranoiacs: read conspiracy)
a suggestion: don't take the bait
ignore threads that don't interest you
and eventually the bickering banter will die away

Juliana's point is well taken, but so is the comment "bland, bland, bland"

The EPC has a links page for publishers, but what if it had a page that
listed nothing but reading announcements. And another that listed
descriptions only of books and magazines. Posted of course by the folks who
want the word out about such events.

Anyone who feels overwhelmed by the # of messages should definitely get the
digest version. It makes a huge difference to get 3 messages if you've been
offline for 72 hours instead of 150.

I only wish all the other lists (PoetryEtc, UKPoets, and subsubpoetics, say)
had the same capacity. CAP-L has a digest option but seems these days to be
stuck on just one or two messages per day.

Rachel et al:
Burt Kimmelman's suggestion is a good one; Hans Blumenberg's ideas
around 'the necessity of forgetting' are interwoven with much else in
his works. This from his Work on Myth which, if my memory serves me,
contains Blumenberg's central idea [sorry about the 'in medias res' form
of the quote]:
"At the same time the art myth of the [Auf den] Marmorklippen [by Ernst
Ju(umlaut)nger] shows that everything that man gained in the way of
dominion over reality, through the experience of his history and finally
through knowledge, could not remove the danger of sinking back--indeed,
the longing to sink back--to the level of his impotence, into archaic
resignation, as it were. But for this sinking back not only to become
possible but to become the epitome of new desires, something had to be
forgotten. This forgetting is the achievement of distance through 'work
on myth' itself. It is a necessary condition of everything that became
possible on this side of terror, of the absolutism of reality. At the
same time it is also a necessary condition of the fact that the desire
to return home to the archaic irresponsibility of simple surrender to
powers that cannot be gainsaid does not need to be resisted and is able
to penetrate to the surface of consciousness."
Three of Blumenberg's books have been translated into English; Work on
Myth, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age and, my personal favorite, The
Genesis of the Copernican World. I especially draw from the chapters
that focus on the Nolan, Bruno, but any and all are well worth your
time.---Carlo Parcelli

Simon & all,

I don't think I've earned the right to define what "L=A=N=G" poetry is
(which is to say I know I'll get in trouble here for my
simpledom--simpletondom?)...that would mean, of course, that neither have
I earned the right to call Hejinian a NON-L=A=N=G poet.  But, ugh, I did,
so here's an attempt at explaining why.

My simplest, puritan definition of an L=A poet would be a poet whose
primary interest is in abandoning (nicer light: questioning) "the
signifying function of language, evoking instead the sounds, the
non-referentiality of words."  In quotes because I scrawled it in my copy
of *Tender Buttons* as being something Chas. Bernstein said about
Stein--this is probably a paraphrase, and it was not intended by CB, to my
knowledge, as a definition of L=A=N=Gpo.  I also've got there that CB said
the desire to "decode" Stein reflects the reader's "misplaced urge to
'make sense' of poetry."  I disagree with CB on Stein here (but I disagree
with almost everyone on Stein, inc. CB's "opposites," who say *TB*'s
just one big coded lesbian statement). And I don't know if I agree or not
with myself putting this fwd as a definition of L=A=N=Gpo (there's some
awkward multiple nodes for ya <grin>).  I do know that I would name
_Writing Is an Aid to Memory_ as what seems to me Hejinian's closest
moment to L=A=N=Gpo, but at the same time I'd feel facile in doing so...

The term "confessional" is clearly problematic.  Someone quite rightly
backchanneled me on my earlier use of it, wondering just what the hell it
meant to me.  I identified, earlier, capital-C confessional poetry with
"speech" and (not or) transparent use of lang., etc., ostensibly about the
self--that is, the self not just of the narrator, but of the writer. Such
a definition (esp. in the sense of transparency) would not usually apply
to Plath or Berryman.  It would sometimes apply to Whitman & O'Hara, Hass
& Gluck.  I dare say there are moments when it would--at least
nearly--apply to S.Howe (whom I can't think of as a L=Apoet, either).  I
failed to say what I identified lowercase-c confessional poetry with,
other than, abstractly enough, a sense of "intimacy."  Even less
academically, I'd say a sense of honesty.  At some point, and I can't
explain why, I stopped "trusting" (jeez, this is sounding like a
confession) the word(s) of those poets who seemed to be consciously asking
for my trust, for me to believe their stories, or their observations, and
why not!, since they were putting it in the clearest, more see-through
language possible, and in writing (much as I've loved much of her work,
for me, one of the most obnoxious lines in poetry is the first sentence
of Forche's "The Colonel": "What you have heard is true."). It'll sound
like an idiot's mobius/mobile, but when I wrote of hitting a "wall" in
reading Confessional Poetry, I meant that I felt something, I think, akin
to the (more documented at my schools) way that many students feel when
first encountering L=A=N=Gpo (or, sometimes, Stein--but not Hejinian).
The "wall" is the language of the poem.  For whatever reason,
"transparent" language, when used in a poem--and I'm operating as one who
cannot think of a "poem" itself as transparent: by "nature," it's a
written, crafted thing--anyway, transparent language, when used in a poem,
so as to (the poet hopes?) direct attention to the "ideas" or "story" or
"thoughts" in the poem and not the language, calls *truckloads* of
attention to the language.   Of Confessional po., Simon writes, "for me,
there is an 'aesthetic experience' (i.e., I do think it's somehow poetic,
and not simply a hashing out in verse)."  Okay: a poem is an aesthetic
experience; a poem in "transparent" language feels, to me, like it's
quietly (read: LOUDLY) trying not to be.  But I'm talking *transparent*
here.  Maybe not even Lowell, but, say, Linda Pastan.

"Trust," "truth," "honesty"--I'm embarrassed even to be writing of them.
And yet I trust Hejinian's poetry, and I trust Stein's.  I trust these
because they manage to be, to me, both critically aware of (and sometimes
delighting in) language/artifice/poemhood *and*, well, intimate.  Whereas,
say, when Adrienne Rich goes "and this is the oppressor's language," it
just doesn't seem either (critically aware/intimate).  In a similar way I
have come to think Marianne Moore's work as almost scarily--so intensely
is it--intimate.

Could it be that I can't explain (and certainly can't convince) because
I'm in love? and for the wrong reasons?  I don't doubt it for a second.
At any rate, Simon, I hope my tone & stumblings here make it clear that I
didn't, in my last post, mean to suggest that you "need to read more of
Hejinian" because you're in some way glaringly wrong in calling her a
L=Apo.  My disagreement is more from the gut than from the intellect (or,
to be sure, the background in L=Apo that I don't have).  And I don't know
who the "most exemplary" L=A=N=Gpoets are, but when I was academically
functioning I found _The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book_ & some of Bob Perelman's
_The Marginalization of Poetry_ helpful in that arena (L=A=N=Gpos, Simon:
don't take this last bit as cheeky.  I mean it sincerely: I read the
books, I digested them, I can remember finding them very good.  But my
scholarhead burnt out not long after and I truly can't remember exactly
who self-identifies, or is suspected of identifying, as a L=Apo.
Bernstein?  Silliman?  Andrews?  Watten?  Grenier?  Not--egads--Hejinian?)

May I bother the List with with a small correction for clarity's

I should like the apostrophe to be placed _outside_ the 's' in
"member's," lest the odd impression be given that I am thinking of a
many-organed individual.

Ah, my last post to the List, and see what I am reduced to. A

_OTHER:_British_and_Irish_Poetry_Since_1970_
Edited by Richard Caddel and Peter Quartermain.
Wesleyan Univ., $19.95 (352 p) ISBN 0-8195-22589; cloth
$45 -22414

     Though England has seen a spate of recent
anthologies of alternative U.K. poetry, this collection
marks the first published in the States in more than
two decades. Caddel, a noted poet, and Quartermain, a
prominent critic of postmodern poetry, collect a
diverse and exciting range of work that is evenly
balanced between such trends as Caribbean dub poetry;
the mellifluous, baroque lyric as it has been developed
in Cambridge; London-based performance and concrete
poetry; and "outsider" figures such as Bill Griffiths
(an independent Anglo-Saxon scholar) and Tom Raworth,
whose Reverdy-inspired early lyrics first found
appreciation in the States. The compelling introduction
portrays a late-millennium English milieu that is
marked by overlapping ethnicities and class
perspectives, but that traces an experimental tradition
"back to Clare, Blake, Smart and the two Vaughans,
Henry and Thomas." The selections from the 55 poets are
brief yet excellent. Barry McSweeney, a self-styled
Rimbaudian, is represented by a number of terse, direct
poems that flaunt pvocative language. Denise Riley's
subtle, tradition-conscious ear allows lines that are
unexpectedly comforting, while Raworth's "That More
Simple Natural Time Tone Distortion," a sonic joy-ride
of one- to three-word lines that bristle with pixilated
narrative, is a contrast to his traditional short lyric
"Out of a Sudden." Tom Leonard's Glasgow Scots, not
unlike John Agard's Guyanese-inflected idiom, brings to
eye and ear a sweet, confident music that is unlike
anything in this country. Veronica Forrest-Thomson, a
poet and critic who died at 28; Cris Cheek; Maggie
O'Sullivan and concrete poet Bob Cobbing are all well
represented, as are important figures who guided the
influx of New American poetry to the islands: Eric
Mottram, Roy Fisher and Andrew Crozier. This is an
important sourcebook to a literature that is probably
more marked by multi-culturalist energy and divergences
from the main modernist line than that of the United
States. (_December_)

In my last post, I mentioned disagreeing with Charles & some other pro.
critics on Stein's *Tender Buttons*, but didn't go into why.  Below is
why.  It's a longish why--a msg. I sent a yr. or so ago to a friend who
was unfamiliar with both some major critics' and, um, my takes on
*TB*, so there appear quotes from critics, then my takes on the quotes.

If length/tone/or topic is unbearable, please delete at will.  But I
didn't think it was--honorable?--to leave with "I disagree with the
world-on-Stein" and no "here's why"s.  em
_________________________________________________________________

On *Tender Buttons*:
*Eliz. Frost, fr. *Postmodern Culture*, v.5 n.3: "Stein's poetic
experiment remains separate from the social and political realms that
avant-garde artists of her day addressed in their highly polemical &
disorienting art & manifestoes.  One need only compare *TB* to any # of
Marinetti's pronouncements, or to Apollinaire's "Merveilles de la Guerre,"
or even Breton's first surrealist manifesto, to see the extent to which
Stein insisted on the privacy of her language...Stein's fetishization of
lang. both exalts lang. to the status of material object & participates in
disguising the erotic 'content' of *TB* as a whole...  [note: GS' tendency
to "isolate intimate, personal experience from the public sphere is being
revisited/critiqued by fem. theorists who stress the political
implications of speech in the public sphere & the 'impossibility' of
separating the symbolic realm of lang. from the social realities lang.
reflects]

*in somewhat of the same vein, William Gass & Lisa Ruddick, on *TB*,
suggest GS uses this hermetic space to create a private lang. of lesbian
experience in which particular words function as clues ("THIS IS THIS
DRESS, AIDER"= "this is distress, Ada"--where "Ada" was a nickname Stein
had for Toklas).  Individual words also function as codes for sexual
experience (cow=orgasm, etc.).

My Thoughts on the Above: bullhunky, mostly.  Must everyone assume the
forms Stein uses are used as hiding places--is that the only way to
interrogate these forms, if we know she was a dyke?  First of all, it does
not appear to me that Stein is hiding anything in her writing--nor would
that thesis gel with the open way in which she lived.  Second, "private
lang." published/publicized isn't all that private anymore, is it?  How
can one say the erotic content of *TB* is disguised?  One would need to
lack much imagination & sense of humor about eroticism to believe
this--the sort of person who needs to see genitals called genitals before
s/he realizes sex is being talked about...or thinks s/he is *special* for
realizing sex is being talked about when genitals *aren't* explicitly
referred to, thinks the general reader won't get this, so it must be
patiently explained in a scholarly essay.  How about the idea that words
that refer specifically to genitals are TIRED?  Aren't cheeky, aren't
erotically FUN anymore?  Take the poem called "PEELED PENCIL, CHOKE," the
entire text of which, after the title, is "Rub her coke."  I find this
dizzingly, a bit disturbingly, but most importantly, *powerfully* erotic.
Would Eliz. Frost have it read "Rub her clit"?  Does she think this really
reads as a command to fondle someone's soda-pop bottle?  I think of the
time K. and I were interrogating the ways in which pop-culture sexual
scripts filtered into our own lives as if naturally--how K., an atheist,
would say "Oh, God" during sex--and so we actively decided to try and
eroticize previously "non-erotic" phrases (say, "I'm a little teapot") by
using them in a sexual context.  Of course this works.  Basically, one is
freshening, or re- inventing, sex, as one might say that GS freshens, or
re-invents, language.  One is naming.  While I'm not convinced that the
question of whether or not GS was politically "radical" enough in her
poetry is the place to start interrogating her form, it seems clear that
this naming, freshening, or whatever you want to call it, is radical at a
far less surface level than penning "I love you, you love me,
homosexuality!"  It is also re-naming/inventing sex & lang. in a far less
narrow way: by this, I mean, NOT just for lesbians.  Dudes can rub her
coke, too.  She can rub a dude's coke, and then we have to re-guess what
coke might mean.  Insofar as GS' work contains specifically lesbian
content (in places in *TB*, more obviously in "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene"
and "Lifting Belly"), it seems to me that she is embracing erotic
experience, period, and that "lesbian sex" is simply the context in which
she knows it.  She's not trying to exalt lesbianism over other erotic
experiences, as so many lesbian writers seem hell-bent on doing: Stein is
in no way *defensive* about her sexual choices.  *She's not on the
defense, so she doesn't need to be on the offense.*  I expect fem.
theorists make their mistakes about Stein because they find it impossible
to explain how she could be so utterly open, so "so what," about her
lesbianism in the early 1900s, when VERY few lesbian writers are "sho
what" about it even now.  It IS almost impossible to believe.  However,
that's how it was, I think.  To the greatest possible extent, Stein seems
(in life, at least) to have simply expected others to rise above thinking
there was anything special about her being a dyke...this "aside" should
certainly pale, she'd think, to her being a "genius."  Which she was
convinced she was, with relatively little public support to substantiate
her claim.  A genius is not a woman, or a lesbian, or a man, or
what-have-you (Stein might think).  It's another species.  It should not
be disturbed with such trivial things as objections to its sex, sex life,
weight, etc.  And, for the most part, it seems that she wasn't (by salon
visitors, etc.).  This must, to some extent, have been due to her demeanor
(and her charisma).  Everyone knows that you can get away with shoplifting
if you just walk in the store acting as though it were your right, and
nothing out of the ordinary, to pocket something.  Note that there was a
large, tight-knit community of lesbians and bi women on the left bank in
Stein's time, salon-ing at Natalie Barney's place--and that Stein had
nothing to do with them.  Why?  Because they were not geniuses.  Picasso,
Alfred Whitehead-- others Stein considered geniuses--were her chosen
company.  Today's fem theorists gnash their teeth upon hearing that GS,
when asked what she thought of "The Woman Question," replied that it had
nothing to do with her.  They are unable to understand how it had nothing
to do with her.  In the name of fem & gay liberation, they would have
preferred that Stein confine herself to these issues in her writing.  How
liberating.
        Gass and Ruddick are correct when they speak of Stein's private
jokes and punning, to the extent that these jokes *do* appear in her
writing.  They do not constitute the main of it, though, and it doesn't
seem at all necessary to refer to them as a "private language of *lesbian*
experience."  They're private jokes, period.  Indulgences, and perhaps a
weakness in Stein's writing.  There probably aren't many writers of any
era, gender, or sexuality that haven't stuck a private joke in here or
there in their writings.  It's difficult to resist--and may be even more
so when you keep hearing that no one understands any of your work, anyway.
I do not believe it is something that should be particularly focused on in
an exploration of Stein's work.

Another Pro's Take: Charles Bernstein argues that, in *TB*, Stein
abandons the signifying function of language altogether, evoking instead
the sounds, the non-referentiality of words.  CB says the desire to
"decode" GS reflects the reader's "misplaced urge to make sense of
poetry."

My Reaction to Bernstein: GS obviously plays with sound in *TB*; one of
the more amusing "plays" appears in "ROASTBEEF," when the paragraph
beginning "Lovely snipe and tender turn" slips aggressively into rhymed
tetrameter--clearly a "referential" move, one that refers to capital-P
poetry.  It seems to me that the desire to "decode" *TB* does indeed
reflect a misplaced urge of the reader--not the urge to make sense of
poetry, but the urge to make sense of, as seen above, a lesbian who
doesn't use lesbian catch-phrases in her work.  I simply do not think it
possible to logically claim that Stein "abandons the signifying function
of language altogether."  For one thing, she preserves syntax and uses a
fairly constant tone--one of a primer, sometimes, of someone making true,
indisputable statements.  There's also a frequent use of negatives: "this
is not," "this does not make," "this is no," etc.--declaratives, "proofs,"
etc.  She *might* be playing with the idea that one can communicate/teach
through silly old words, she *might* be making fun of sense in the way
it's popularly conceived.  But here again, it seems to me that she's
simply re- inventing/freshening an old idea of what making sense *is*.  By
which I mean that she *is* making sense in *TB*, but in a new way, in a
way that forces the reader to question "sense" and making it in the same
way that K. and I were forced to question sexual scripts.  To say that
*TB* does not make sense and is not representational is akin to saying
that a Cubist painting does not make sense and is not representational.
Of course a Cubist painting is representational of reality.  It's
representational of multiple realities/perspectives, though.  It changes
the boundaries of what is meant by "reality."  In this, Cubism seems to me
*very* purposeful, very scientific--an absolutely logical reponse of
painting to photography, which at that time was "taking over" traditional
representational painting.  GS' work has been compared to Cubist
paintings, and some of the poems in *TB* read almost like word-painting
representations of their titles (for ex. "A METHOD OF A CLOAK," "WATER
RAINING," and the--menstrually-ruined?--petticoat of "A PETTICOAT").
        What's interesting is that, while Cubism follows naturally from
photography's "threat" to "directly representational" painting (naturally
in time/history), Stein's forms could really, as avant- garde as she
seemed then and does even today, have happened ages before Stein
"invented" them.  Writing as a method of representing reality has *always*
occupied a challenged space, and poetry in particular had long been seen
as something "other" than the representation of reality, whether it be
seen as a "heightened" reality or whatever.  "Real people don't speak in
rhymed meter," etc.  It seems the most obvious thing in the world to say
"Stein was before her time," but was she *really*?  I can think of nothing
occurring in history at Stein's particular moment that made her form
"necessary" *right then*, as Cubism & abstract expressionism seemed
necessary to the survival of painting in a photographable world.  It
could've happened a century, centuries earlier.  I imagine Stein
understanding this and being absolutely at a loss as to why others
considered her work so "out there."  I imagine her almost laughing because
she'd "lucked in" to her genius-ness: noticed what, "unbelievably!", no
one had noticed before.  It could be said, bizarrely, that Stein's writing
is both primitive and avant-garde.  She alternately telescopes and
microscopes, steps incredibly close to and back from objects.  The *TB*
phrase "Object that is in wood," from the poem "A WAIST," reminds one of
an archaeologist reporting on an artifact whose use is unknown.  Whatever
the "object that is in wood" is, no one who knows the name of said object
would refer to it as an "object that is in wood."  An observation that
basic is (nearly) no longer available when one knows the name of the
object.  Your generalized poet would take the name of the object and then
add description *to the name*, would build on the given.  Here, Stein
builds *backwards* from the given.   Somewhere Anne Sexton writes that a
poet is one who builds trees out of wood furniture.  I do not think this
is often the case, but with Stein, with "object that is in wood" and its
equivalents, it is apt.  I guess I'd say here GS works to uncover what the
"civilized, educated" psyche *smooths* over--what is no longer available
to the all-too-trained (and rushed) eye.  Stein's dealing with the psyche,
here, as she does in more obvious ways *Three Lives* and *The Making of
Americans* (and there it is only more obvious because she's actively
questioning the motives/architecture of different personality
"types"--whereas here, it's any reader's, any observer's, psyche that is
being not questioned, but, in some way, restored: Stein is really
restoring ways of seeing that have been lost, as much as or more than she
is inventing new ways of seeing).

Misc. Notes (not on Tender Buttons)  Always controversial is Stein's
statement "There is no such thing as repetition," esp. since so many
readers read her as repetitive: in The Making of Americans, some of the
portraits., etc. (not TB).  "Repetitive"-looking passages in Stein are
often permutations, not repetitions of a phrase (a compliment Stein always
cherished was someone's comparison of her work to Bach's fugues).  But
there ARE certain sentences repeated verbatim, and more than once.  What
were these to Stein, if not repetitions?  How should we read them?  Okay,
my thesis: it's not at all hard to argue that one can't repeat the same
sentence when speaking.  It'll never sound exactly the same way twice--the
timbre of the voice might vary, a car might pass by,  acts of speech are
inherently acts of performance, etc.  I think Stein is insisting that
neither can one type the same sentence twice.  Perhaps forcing us to
imagine the conditions under which each sentence was typed.  There can be
no repetition because this sentence was typed at 10:41, and this sentence,
which contains exactly the same words, at 10:42.  Hence Stein's concept of
the "continuous present."  I think?  If so, she was bumping against the
langue v. parole debate somewhat before the debate supposedly officially
started (at least as we read it today).  Claiming the same primacy (and
indeterminacy?) for the written as for the spoken word.  And for the read
word: I read the sentence in different conditions than you, so each
sentence is endlessly new.  Hmm.

Re: femtheory, lesbians, & gender identity: In addition to saying that the
"woman question" didn't concern her, Stein referred to herself as
"husband" and Alice as "wife" (Stein & Picasso in one room discussing art,
their wives dicussing hats and perfume in the other room).  It would be
wrong, however, to label theirs a butch-femme relationship.  Stein was no
butch.  There were famous butches in Paris at the time: Radclyffe Hall,
Lady Una Trowbridge, etc., as well as famous femmes: Natalie Barney, etc.
These butches dressed the part--hats, trousers, ties, short slicked- back
hair.  Stein wore skirts, not pants, and only cut her hair to
Caesar-length quite late in life.  It would be more accurate to view
theirs as a male-female relationship than a butch-femme one...that is,
more accurate to see Stein as "transgendered" than as a lesbian.  The
woman question did not concern her because she was not a woman.  This may
be hard to grasp, and it's hard to communicate.  But butch-femme
relationships are highly coded ones, and dress is an essential--perhaps
THE essential--marker of them.  And when I say "transgendered," I don't
necessarily mean that Stein thought of herself as a man.  I think she
thought of herself as a Stein (or a genius)--somehow outside of gender.
She seems to have dressed in whatever she found comfortable, rather than
making the very active & time-consuming decisions a butch must in putting
together a coded appearance.
        Similarly, in "Patriarchal Poetry," where Stein denounces
"Patriarchal Poetry," I think it's a definite mistake to read this as a
denouncement of poetry by men.  Huge!  Some fem-lesbs latch onto this one
poem as "proof" that Stein was politically conscious and cared about them.
But by "patriarchal poetry," I believe Stein means "establishment poetry,"
or canonical verse.  Not all men write patriarchal poetry, and some women
do.  There is no call for a "matriarchal" poetry, and remember that Stein
was buying non-establishment paintings by men before anyone else-- *while*
everyone else was defacing them at painting exhibitions.  It would be the
same "patriarchy" keeping these male painters from being appreciated that
kept Stein's work from being appreciated...

anselm, beth:

by "abstract french lyric" my guess at the work being referred to would be
that of anne-marie albiach, claude royet-journoud, perhaps also dominique
fourcade, jacqueline risset, jean daive, phillipe denis, and of a slightly
older generation, jacques dupin, andre du bouchet, et al. french originals
might be had at a good library, and translations available from presses
like sun/moon, burning deck, post apollo...

hoping that helps,

Hi Anselm!  I think Simon's "Reverie" on the French abstract lyric is a li=
ttle
off-base.  Hi Simon!  As I understand it, the term was introduced more
recently to explain why contemporary French post-Derridean poetry which, i=
n
Celan-like terms, raised the problem of the lyric voice nevertheless had a
lyric look and feel to it, as indeed Celan's poetry had.  The lyrical tend=
ency
is abstracted into a play of language influenced by a theoretics; and the
personal emotional content is cauterised or ablated or something, although=
 the
impulsion of poet into poetry remains what it always has been, from the gu=
t.
But the lyrical music still lives along the fragmented lines, and let's no=
t
even mention "erasure" please!  Perhaps the finest example, if I'm right i=
n my
derivations, would be Anne-Marie Albiach's work, some of it recently
translated by Keith Waldrop as Geometry.  But I think more particularly of=
 her
Etat and Viva Voce.  When you hear her read (not usually possible), you ca=
n
sense what I can only call a lyrical time interval occur within the Mallar=
m=E9an
white spaces of the page.  The specifically post-Derridean movement in Fre=
nch
poetry really began, following Tel Quel mag of the sixties, with Claude Ro=
yet-
Journoud's, Anne-Marie's, and Michel Couturier's magazine Si=E8cle =E0 Mai=
ns in
1969-70 in my opinion.

Emily Lloyd said:  "Must everyone assume the
forms Stein uses are used as hiding places--is that the only way to
interrogate these forms, if we know she was a dyke?  First of all, it does
not appear to me that Stein is hiding anything in her writing--nor would
that thesis gel with the open way in which she lived.  Second, "private
lang." published/publicized isn't all that private anymore, is it?  How
can one say the erotic content of *TB* is disguised?  One would need to
lack much imagination & sense of humor about eroticism to believe this."

Emily, just wanted to thank you for your long and concerned posts on these
various LangPo & Stein issues.  We actually disagree on a fair amount of
the particulars but in honor of the list's recent despair I figured I'd
stick mostly to areas where discussions might be productive rather than
merely antagonistic.  Those who've had the patience/time/interest to read
my posts in the past won't be surprised when I say, as I think Charles B
would, that non-referential langauge is not necessarily non-signifying
langauge.  Stein would have understood this as well, being a student of
William James.  Tender Buttons does indeed signify all over the place,
though I don't believe it is particularly concerned with the
referentiallity of language.

But - in regards to the quote from you above, I'd be inclined to agree
with you.  Particularly in regards to your statement that "it does
not appear to me that Stein is hiding anything in her writing."  TB has
always seemed to me not a repressed work in the least -- not a matter of
closeting or any such thing.  To believe so would be to drop Freud very
oppressively into Stein's brain and, again, as far as psychology is
concerned, Stein is not a Freudian bu a Jamesian.  So what else is there
to say then.  Well, I think there's another way to talk about *codes*
without talking about *hiding*.  And here it is: I think then when we're
dealing with TB we are properly in the realm of slang.  Here's Paul
Goodman on slang and I think it's pretty relevant to what's going on it
TB:

"Much of slang is first invented as a neologism of a gang or special
group...yet it comes into circulation *as slang* by breaking out of its
sub-culture.  When the boundary is broken, there is a different kind of
language, not self-naming and defensive but common and wild...slang
creates new language just like poetry, and it can be regarded as a kind of
folk poetry...Whitman says, 'Slang is the lawless, germinal element below
all words and sentences and behind all poetry.'"

So, when we're talking about lines like "rub her coke" I would say, as I
think you said, that we're not talking about language which is secret and
coded but, as Goodman says, "common and wild."  That's what's so great
about it!  What the hell's so fun about saying Stein was trying to hide
the fact that she was a dyke?  Not only does it seem quite wrong, it seems
- worse! - boring.  Stein's *intent* doesn't interest me that much but if
I had to address it I would say that she knew enough about the nature of
language as fundamentally *public* (i.e., collaborative, un-hideable,
un-tameable, circuitous) to understand that one's codes never stay hidden
- they move out into common arenas and do work with/on/against/through
other codes.

As an aside, I'd like to say that this sort of talk (the kind Emily
initiated) is an important part of this list.  It's not just announcements
and the occassional brief, inevitably kind review.  I know that to open it
up to more than this risks occassional chaos, hurt feelings, and
abandonment by listmembers we admire.  But I also believe (and I say this
with full sympathy for posts such as the recent one from Juliana) that the
list cannot remain viable and vital if it is merely an uncontentious
bulletin board.  Thanks.   -Mike.

that it had been Treblinka -- cld it have ever become a void, truly?
or, in a broader sense, cld anything erased become void?  or wld it
become something else entirely -- itself transmuted in an attempt
to erase?  which then, textually, does it become itself plus the process?
in which case itself 'erased' is more charged than forgotten?
I agree w/ "erasure as a positive complement to inscription" but find myself
wandering here in this maze of what is the void & how is this inescapable?
Rachel's poem excerpted earlier begins : "It's true that every ending only
erases
the board / rather than filling it." which seems to embrace the inextricable
entaglement of forgetting / remembering & their simultaneous natures.
so then, yes -- what is the opposite of erasure but also what is erasure?

the smear about intimidating people.  he shd talk.  I treated everybody to

"The abstract French lyric" is an infamous coinage of Ron Silliman's, in
Philly Talks.  He claimed that this was what most poets were today
publishing (not including the workshop types, natch).  And that it was
very limited and limiting, that most people were only doing the A.F.L.
This occasioned much bemused head-scatching, here in @lanta, and
elsewhere. The "French" is especially intriguing.  Totally off-base, i
would say; but intriguing and provocative.  Is it because contemporary
post-L=A=N=G tendencies trace back historically to Rimbaud and Mallarme?
Certainly Char and surrealism are not the primary inputs in contemporary
u.s. work!  (Throwing down the gaunlet here to RS, to defend his honor)

Murmur pet murmur pet murmur.
Push sea push sea push sea push sea push sea push sea push sea push sea.
Sweet and good and kind to all.
                --Stein from Sacred Emily

Emily,

Thanks for your Stein posts, they are great.  Who are the feminists you
take issue with?  I think the issue of what Stein was thinking about is
slippery, clearly her work is no political gripe even when she is head
on the subject of global politics, mostly her thoughts observations are
fodder for the experiments.  Some of her projects seem more transparent
to me as a reader than others.  Maria Damon's discussion of Yet Dish as
Yiddish in her essay in _the dark end of the street_ came as a
revelation to me, and I can no longer think German w/o hearing 'gem in'
or Polish without 'a polish' or Russian, 'rush in slice' (and then I
rush to Brighton Beach to have a rush in slice of smoked salmon)

As far as her gender identification--yes perhaps not an issue, she liked
girls and girls was good but what if she didn't like girls?  I mean
don't you think the desexualization of men is meaningful to her
accomplishment?  Also, I think that the time and place of Paris when GS
was writing there, while N.Barney et al were saloning it up was the last
time before the 1990's when there was an actively aestetic context for
lesbians.  "Lesbian" per say may not be an aestetic category but social
context--as separate as she was from it--could allow Stein to have a 'so
what' attitude and yet not be rendered invisible by denial.  She was
separate but in contact with the both the lesbian scene and the black
scene, and my sense is that these were important to her in terms of
being "of her time" rather than outside of it, ahead of it, which she
flatly denies as a possiblitity. "No one is aheat of his time, it is
only that the particular variety of creating his time is the one that
his contemporaries who also are creating their own time refuse to
accept." (Composition as Explanation) Which to me is a great rebuke to
those prissy gasps and the fact that GS counted her self among a handful
of world geniuses--there are varieties of being genius, someone else
could have her handful too.  I'm going off here but I think what's
shocking is that Stein (and this goes back to Damon) had the chutzpah to
say what she thought of herself and what allowed her to indulge in the
experiment  of writing.  It's more palpable and gentile in these parts
to say "I'm nobody! Who are you?"

So, by the way, who are people's five living geniuses?  I'll have to
think about that myself.

By the way, check out below what happened to your post on my server.
How much did I miss?

HISTORY

having planted corn, you wait
for corn to grow. The enemy is
the penchant to believe you know.

Wheat in bread is bleached to sell.
Roads ripple in heat, split in cold.
Light bends out of courtesy to mass,
a social arrangement between peers.

No schoolman can tell a sentence
how to mean. Like border guards,
children learn their craft by losing
the nationality they're paid to defend.

Metaphors rise against their masters.
No player's marginal in plague &
Time runs counter to its crop.


MUSIC OF THE SPHERES

Our ghost story you could learn to croon
unhurried into microphones.  Ears ready
for the kill, listeners expect each moment
a crash as you steer the story past Crab
& Dragon & on to dusk.  After the plot

runs out, mechanisms still roll--sets shift,
props drift down river toward an uneasy sea.
Spectators murmur in their crape.  Cattle
standing all day sleep standing & old
hotels maintain their facades; an owner
must care for his property.  No motion

among stars is harmonious.  Ghouls & caped
heroes play their part under weather that
is neither fair nor just.  Squeal, flex,
erupt: among humans earthworks catch on fire.
I have always felt like a native of this planet

but a stand-in for my ghost.



WHOLESALE SURRENDER

A backdoor melody spieling of spring
        wins nothing, pulls ahead of the
        pack on the road to release.

A creased pant leg can mean the difference
        between promotion & serial obsession,
        one silk-screened beside the other
        in infinite regression.

A rime honeys tea or, given the proper
        economics, signals a secret crop
        among the tenants.

Televised, repeated blows to the head & gut
        don’t raise questions for the fan at home.
        Even a quark shares space--o unholy
        alliance--with that fool, History.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Interesting points. I have spent a fair section of my life not erasing, but
recovering. I currently help support a system that deliberately keeps all
the changes and every document submitted to the aegis of this system can be
viewed at a particularly point in it's change history. In addition to this,
there can be more than one current version of the document: the development
tree can be split into trunk and branch. Nothing ever gets erased, although
there is an illusion of erasure. The way the system does this is for the
tip to be the latest copy, and the changes required to take it back to it's
original state are kept on a version basis. And disk-space isn't at a
premium in these matters.

Indeed, the whole system of changes has  been developed to a high ceremony
where the requests (for changes), the changes, the source and the tasks (to
do the changes) are managed.

I would also note that the erasure discussed here reminds me of space
management on a computer's hard-disk: go and delete a file, and it
disappears from your folder. It hasn't gone - most systems flag the disk
space used by the file for further usage rather than erasing the file (some
systems actually write nonsense in it's stead as a kind of track-covering
(another erasure)). You can get systems which resurrect these "lost" files
- although obviously, this is sometimes partial. I'd like to think you
could re-cover such deletions into some kind of textuality.

Douglas Coupland described people as "amnesia machines". I would go
further. I think erasure is the easiest and is always. If things weren't
erased/forgotten we'd have "eternal return" - and what a terrible burden
that would be. The best we can hope is that fragments and distortions
remain.

suffering from severe vertigo at the moment, rushing from one tube to
another, trying to follow the impeachment hearings on tv and the one here
on poetix... i feel for henry g's plight, but must observe that what
charles sez is no less true:  that many folks have unsubbed from poetix for
all sortsa reasons (incl. my wife/partner kass, above "from" line), and
that nary a public tear has been shed when this has happened (and if it's
happened in silence, we all know why---or should)... whatever else, however
much i believe that charles should operate on a strictly frontchan
basis---and contra henry (and kent---sorry guys)---i yet do not attribute
evil ideological motives to charles, and believe that to do so is, well,
just plain unfair, maybe even ungrateful...

this list is now enjoying (?) it's fifth anniversary as a public-private
list---it began back in december of 93, if i recall correctly, at the end
of a semester when it was used as a list for charles's grad course... and
having been here 'from the beginning,' i think it's been an amazingly
productive forum, and feel, with alan, that it's likewise amazing that our
recent problems have taken this long to e-merge... moreover, this is itself
a clear sign of the even-handedness with which charles has run this list
(even allowing that recent allegations are in any sense true)... anyone who
doubts this ought to have a good long look at those first coupla of
(sometimes contentious) years...

to pick up on something i said, in jest, earlier, and as i just backchanned
someone (so nice to work out my thinking elsewhere for a change!):  the
whole thing reminds me of the anarchist/fascist split in italy... and i
guess i have to be one of the fascists, b/c there's only two groups
[cough], and the anarchists have clearly proclaimed their loyalties as
such... and as to the "insult poetry" thread, which has taken such
scholarly directions of late (thank the lord), but which in some sense
precipitated our recent melt-down:  even setting aside the fact that (as
i've said before), the list is not merely performative; and even imagining
an actual insult thread in which folks (mostly men, no doubt) exchanged
insulting/agonistic barbs in order to attain, uhm, enlightenment:  are any
of you really suggesting, really, that this is how you wish to use your
time?... well if so, ok (and btw, just to be clear:  i hear the
kent/eliza/david b/george b thread in somewhat different terms---no real
insults there, far as i can tell)...

but i wouldn't be the first to observe that anyone tossing insults, even in
such obviously modulated terms ("for fun"), is likely to be outclassed when
it comes to same by the most unschooled of the blue-collar workers i grew
up around, and sometimes worked with... nothing against said blue-collar
workers, mind you, but just so's we're all on the same page, that y'all are
aware i'm extremely good at spotting even the glimmer of a silver spoon up
someone's ass...

hell, it's too bad we're not celebrating the fucking list right
now---raising w/o ire, perhaps by way of a "review," what reservations we
may have---rather than picking to pieces the person who's primarily
responsible for its existence in the first place...

---------------------

anyway, yes, i DO have a question, and would greatly appreciate any
backchan help:  i'm trying and have been unsuccessful at tracking down a
citation for valery's "all theory is autobiography" (or something to this
effect)... can anyone help me out here?... sorry to have to post the list
for something this straightforward, but for some reason it's eluding me...
probably owing in part to my vertigo, above...

many thanx... and apologies for the delete-able prologue...

best,

joe

I highly, admiringly recommend Spencer Selby's new book from Angle Press - The
Big R.  This is an exceptionally wonderful work that you won't regret having
and reading and re-reading.  I've always liked Spencer's work.  This
particular example of it is more stunning than ever.  Read to find out why.
Buy it and savor!

        Seems as though I had this information at one time or another, but
I can't seem to find it now.  Has anyone got contact, subscription, and
contents information for the magazine, Big Allis?  By "contents" I mean a
partial list of contributors to the latest number.
        It might be helpful to others to post your reply to the list as a

I believe that the above is true, and apt, and yay to Joe for saying it.
There have been far more expressions of support for Henry than for the
significant number of people who have left before him (because like Henry
they felt stifled).  A number of them have posted...And i must say two who
in recent memory have *also* like Henry left in a rage, are FAR more
important to me as poets and positive presences on the poetry scene than
he is:  Tom Beckett and Juliana Spahr.

Now i have been looking back at JS's post of a couple of days ago; i
believe it would be more constructive to discuss her accusations toward
the List, than Henry's.  Is it really a place that is "only friendly to
white men"?  As a white man, it's a little hard for me to contradict that.
(Nor do i want to contradict it:  i hope all of us will *examine* it...)

I can't think of a poet of greater promise and accomplishment on the scene
right now, than JS.  And her highly political and challenging work has
been very valuble to me.  That she should make so sharp a critique, and
leave the List, seems to me the real important issue of this recent
tumultuous period.

Anyway, to wrap up, i also agree with Joe and others that Charles B. has
done a very good job.  Is doing a good job.  As someone posted in the last
couple of days, the listowner/moderator on any listserv does a huge amount
of work and donates significant resources and time and nerves and energy
and vulnerability.  They do this because they cared enuff to do it.  They
have and must have the space to moderate.. (Unless they act in a
strikingly arrogant and insulting way;  and contrary to the gouldites I
believe that is not the case here.)

I believe that Kent (for whom i have lotsa liking and respect), and others
who've taken up the cudgel on behalf of Henry, are using a model that
assumes this is a radical democracy, here on the List.  Like a collective.
It is not that.  It cannot be that. As a socialist i want to establish a
radical democracy without private ownership of capital in society at
large;  and i want there to be community wherever we can meaningfully
build community.  But we cannot declare a listserv a community any more
than we can declare that all the little poetry magazines by right should
belong to their readers and contributors, and prnounce that they are now
collectives and communities, and have been liberated from their editors.

A few people are providing resources that the rest of us are benefitting
from; if all of us could help CB shoulder the burden of running this
thing, then it could be a collective and people could vote, etc.  In the
meantime, the list managers *have* to take the heat for things that happen
here.  No one can change that.   So they also have ultimate say over what
happens here--no one can change that either, any more than on any other
moderated listserv.

in struggle,
mark p.

Rachel writes: <<<I'm going off here but I think what's shocking
is that Stein (and this goes back to Damon) had the chutzpah to
say what she thought of herself and what allowed her to indulge in the
experiment  of writing.  It's more palpable and gentile in these parts
to say "I'm nobody! Who are you?">>>

Darn tootin'.  I like Camille Paglia, Nietzsche, and Dennis Rodman in some
cases more for their nearly refreshing chutzpah than their work.  Of
course, they've made said chutzpah an issue, while Stein seems to have
been more graceful.  Or more interested in making "more important" things
her issues.

I learned much from Damon's essay on "Yet Dish," too, and hear those same
echoes.

Rachel also writes:
<<I mean don't you think the desexualization of men is meaningful to her
accomplishment?>>
and
<<"Lesbian" per say may not be an aestetic category but social
context--as separate as she was from it--could allow Stein to have a 'so
what' attitude and yet not be rendered invisible by denial.>>

That first one's a really tough question.  There was a time when I
would've said "of course" and assumed those who didn't were either
woman/or homo phobic.  Now I want to be slower to say yes.  The
desexualization of men probably helped her to see men as her own brother
singulars--to not get bogged in the "I'm just a girl, what does my stuff
matter?" thing or the "I must have male approval of my writing" thing.
And many sexy Stein poems (esp.the "banter between GS and ABT" one)
mightn't have turned out the same way were she not desexualizing men.
Though possibly she would've written just as sexy "heterosexual poems". I
guess I want to say that I don't think desexualizing men is in any way
connected with escaping either of the two bog-things I've just mentioned.
Lesbians, for the most part, are still seen as women and "women"--of
whatever sexuality--for the most part, are still going to be "trained" to
consider male approval important, and witness enough to cause the "I'm
just a girl, what does my stuff matter?" to happen.  H.D., for a time, an
admittedly young time, was a pretty pathetic queer re:these--and who
wouldn't have been? (and yet, Loy wasn't too pathetic a heterosexual)

These days it might be even more amazing to meet a lesbian writer with the
chutzpah to not need *lesbian*, rather than male, approval.  Stein rarely
seems to have *required* (I don't say wanted) the approval of readers of
any gender or sexuality.  Except maybe Alice.  And on bad days Leo.  I
think of Stein less as having desexualized men and more as having
degendered herself, at least in wondering which may have had more to do
with her accomplishment.  I think of Stein when I read Hejinian's (uh-oh,
not her again) "No wonder there are no/single notes, no unique gender" and
think "bull."  Who was it, Witting?, who made the claim "Lesbians are not
women"?  I disagree with whoever it was.  There're all kinds of lesbians
who would collapse without their male friends or male approval as others
might collapse w/o same from females (and far rarer others who wouldn't
collapse from lack of support from anyone). To say "Stein was not
a woman"--in the sense that Witting/whoever meant "woman"-- wouldn't seem
wholly unlikely to me.  Somehow she slipped through--or chiseled & kicked,
w/o making much noise, through--the cracks.  Stein was a being.

Please don't get me wrong.  I certainly think Stein's queerness affected
her work.  I just think it was a queerer queerness than lesbianism...in
the "degenderate" sense, or in the queerness of having a skyrocket's
measure of chutzpah & faith in one's own work.

I'm afraid on GS I can be a bit like someone standing on a st. corner kind
of raving at everyone who walks by, yelling some obsessive "point", & not
backing it up with passages from scripture, or "She Bowed to Her Brother,"
or any text.  Someone with a big hunch on her shoulder.  But I hope this
had been in some way clarifying--?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

WE FEEL IT IS OUR DUTY TO INFORM YOU THAT CHARLES BERNSTEIN HAS
COMMITTED A GREAT SLANDER UPON THE MEMORY OF JOSEPH BEUYS!!

Through some cruel irony, Joan Retallack and Jackson MacLow will be
reading December 11 at DIA Center for the Arts in New York City.

DIA is concurrently hosting an exhibit of the installations of the
German artist Joseph Beuys.  Beuys, of course, felt that he should make
the time to build an artistic legacy that would be generous and
inclusive.

Beuys felt a strong committment to teaching & as such felt it morally
wrong to turn away anyone seeking to enter the dialogue about art.

On the first day of the winter semester of 1972 'Beuys wrote the names
and addresses of the 125 candidates who had been rejected in August on
the basis of their portfolio submissions; by doing so he confirmed their
admission to his class.  Beuys then demanded that all the rejected
applicants be formally registered.'

"If 400 students want to study with me I'll stay here as long as they
want."

Beuys felt that we had a 'restricted idea of culture which debases
everything'.

"We reject now and in the future, as a wrongful infringement of academic
freedom, any attempt to impose an admissions policy on our class.  The
same goes for any regulations regarding the number of students in our
classes.  (The Academy is free).  And the same goes for any other
regulations that infringe on this principle of freedom.  It is thus
possible for a teacher, if he is willing, to admit 142 additional
students, although others - tenured teachers - feel themselves
overburdened with six or so students.  Questions of Academy capacity,
shortage of space, shortage of service staff, shortage of teaching
materials, shortage of teachers, have no bearing whatever on admissions
regulations.  Responsibility for such deficiencies, in relation to those
involved and to the people as a whole, lies with the authorities
concerned, with their officials, and ultimately with the party
politicians who rule in disregard of the majority.  An arbitrary limit
on student numbers is a violation of basic rights and not a proper
solution to the problem of capacity."

Such is the spirit of Beuys violated by the sentiments of those who
control this list.

"The Academy is like a battleship under fire.  We are in an emergency. I
want to portray a sick system and to try, as far as possible, to work
within it.  The school has a reponsiblity to society.  The concept of
liberty plays an essential role here.  I consider it my duty above all
not to turn away students who want to enter my class.  I shall not yield
until the tanks draw up to the Academy!"

The Langpo's so typically want to usurp the thunder of someone like
Joseph Beuys without taking the tiniest risks. Joseph Beuys should not
be so dishonored.

The quote in my earlier post, "forked tongue?", is from Charles
Bernstein's Writing and Method. He recommends among other things 'anger'
in philosophical discourse. However, what's good enough for philosophy
is obviously too much of a living idea for peauxetiquettes.

Finally, Beuys wrote: "The evolution of Western Thought, in philosphy,
and of the resulting concept of science, especially what is called exact
scientific thought, has been a quest to attain matter....[But] you only
attain matter when you attain death...." That quote was just for me.

"A few people are providing resources that the rest of us are benefitting

thing, then it could be a collective and people could vote, etc.  In the
meantime, the list managers *have* to take the heat for things that happen
here.  No one can change that.   So they also have ultimate say over what
happens here--no one can change that either, any more than on any other
moderated listserv."

and a clarification of what I said earlier (apologies if this seems
self-indulgent but I feel like otherwise I might be misrepresented and I'm
the nervous type when it comes to such things).  Yes, in some ways this
list clearly cannot be a radical democracy, but in other ways it can and
is, and I don't think Charles's moderate restrictions preclude such
democratic possibility - they only preclude anarchy which is quite
different.  In any event, I have no problem with moderate restrictions
designed to ensure the most liberty for each listmember compatible with
the liberty of all other members. My original worry was that Henry had
actually been *banned* from the list which would have been a real drag.
But to set some guidelines for number of posts seems both inevitable and
wise.  So for what its worth, my sense of Henry's value to the list
doesn't contradict, as far as I'm concerned, support for Charles who I
think does a bang up job just keeping this mess up and running.

2 things I want to edit-for-the-record there: I meant "banter between GS

writtem "The desexualization etc. probably helped her to not get bogged

connected with escaping the bogs."

I meant *necessarily* connected--more importantly, to me, is that it's

--(please forgive cross postings)--

Hello everyone:

I am currently taking orders for:

A new pamphlet sized book(like the old Black Sparrow books),
_What's Up with Modern Art_, selected short reviews and other art
writings by Frank O'Hara, edited by Bill Berkson.  A charming
unpublished photo of FOH graces the back.  The collection takes its name
after a wonderful article, reprinted here, subtitled "Kids Quiz A
Critic" from _Ingenue_, a glossy magazine "for sophisticated teens",
(1964). From Mike and Dale's Press. Only $5 (US)dollars.

As some may know, I was to edit the fall issue of _Mike and Dale's
Younger Poets_ under the title _Mike and Dale and Hoa's Younger Poets_.
Mike has since gone on to other projects; Dale & I are to continue
publishing a quarterly poetry magazine in the same format and similar
vein.  To recognize the shift in editorship, we are naming the new
venture _Skanky Possum_ after the venerable critter that skanks around
our neighborhood.  _Skanky Possum #1_ includes poets such as Eileen
Myles, Linh Dinh, Rachel Loden, Sotere Torregian, Anselm Berrigan, Carl
Thayler and Alice Notely, as well as an exerpt from a memoir of Philip
Whalen by Tensho Schneider and classic-movie reviews by Bill Berkson.
_Skanky Possum_ features hand painted covers.  From Skanky Possum Press.
Only $5 (US) dollars.

To order either, please indicate your order (title, # of copies) and
send a check made payable to me (Hoa Nguyen) to:

2925 Higgins Street
Austin, TX 78722

Please forward this announcement to anyone who may be interested.
Thanks for your support.

Love, Hoa

Subject:      The Hat
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

If you haven't already, check out The Hat, edited by Jordan Davis and
Chris Edgar. The quality of writing varies, but it is especially
interesting to read next to the recent Moving Borders Anthology.

The writing in The Hat is motivated by various complex yankee anxieties
of gender, race and 'consciousness,' with language as the mediating
force. J. Spahr's piece examines gender-specific pronouns that are used
to construct a kind of "love" poem to some equally distant being bound
in the process of internal re-imagination (or is it re-ordering?). Her
lines are expressed according to syllogistic logic, direct but
complicated by other syntactic "movements" of repetition and rhetorical
positions.

"So this," she writes, "is what is meant by the 'seeking that takes
       place between
prelanguaged and languaged states, before and behind the 'I.''"

And then a few lines later:

"Or I or he or she am or is trying
missing or mixing things up.
Thanks for the directions."

Juliana's insistent position that we examine and articulate the
complexity of gender and human construction is valiant, moreso since her
critique has tightend here, for me, becoming more direct and less
hesitant. Although firmly entrenched in the socio-cultural, her energy
appears to come from another place entirely, but other readers can
determine that for themselves.

With 20 pages, Kimberly Lyons receives the most space in this issue. The
poems are sharp, angular, focused on naturally occuring phenomena.
Objects lie in juxtapositions that create imaginative possibilities.
Some might find only colors and shades here; others only sentimental
attachments. But the phrasing and rhythm, the space around the lines--
these things create a radiation of event that swells up from within the
poem:

Trees fill
the window and
light
is thin, holds its dust.

On the bar
last night I saw
Three martinis,
trembling triangles.
Nancy said
this is the first time
I've felt happy.
big white trucks.
I guess everybody goes there
at least once.

The line breaks and injambment play with meaning. There's a strangeness
here that resists explanation. There's a sense of revelation without
opaque self-consciousness. You can see why the editors chose so many
pieces from her.

Janice Lowe address race directly in her poem, "The Summervilles of
Pickens County." She resists theorizing the politics of racial encounter
by revealing experience that lives "in the mouth." Although her use of
the little 'i' is annoying, the coloquial articulation of this poem
builds a powerful address.

i tell the black ones calling me red
    you wanna be red like me nigger
the white ones
    you redder than me you gotdam cracker
all this is turning me
into a kind of peckerwood nigger
i don't like for people to be black and greasy at the same time
i prefer yellow women for lovemaking some have said
all my children have lightskinned mothers
of course i'm a race man

Witness the velocity of those lines, the build-up and speed. Like many
of the pieces in this collection, the concerns of the social are
delivered in a language that feels threaded to other agencies of
expression. This only complicates and increases the emotional
trajectories aimed against the dominate regimes of the social.

Anyhow, it's a magazine worth checking out. Poems by Catherine Barnett,
Brenda Coultas, Tonya Foster, Greta Goetz, Lisa Jarnot, Carol Mirakove,
Ange Mlinko, Cynthia Nelson, Hoa Nguyen, Alice Notley and Prageeta
Sharma are also included.

Contact Jordan if you're interested. The Hat is cool.

Dale

One more post, then I'll stop being such a space glutton.

In a course once, while we were discussing the work of a poet who wrote in
fragments, somebody said, "But once we get the whole fragment thing, why
do we need any more poems written in fragments?  I mean, I *get* it
already."  Basically a riff on Williams' "All sonnets say the same thing,"
replacing "sonnets" with "fragments," and of course I countered with "Why
do we need any more sonnets?" etc.  I couldn't decide whether the person
was playing devil's advocate or just being kind of stupid.

I'm ready for folks to be similarly indecisive about me: when does the
proliferation of "erasurey" work at this point in time go from being the
(only? most?) possible, logical, ethical response to the past half-century
to being, well, maybe, kind of trendy?  Ever?  ("Instant Ethics! Just add
white space!" ...and when did the term "stubble fields" go from being
a term one might but probably needn't ever use to the requisite included
term in all poems published in *Poetry*?)

On another tack--what, if any, is the relationship between "the poetry of
erasure" (not bad lyrics for a europop group) and, also specific to our
last (max.?) 50 yrs or so, the poetry of "breaking one's silence" (if
one's in any group viewed as or treated as a minority)?  Can one "break
one's silence" w/ an erasure?  I think so!  How about that!  Interesting.

Hilton brought up Paul Auster.  I've only read *The New York Trilogy*, in
which characters become the obsessive, thorough, unwitting agents of their
own erasure.  In doggedly trying to fill some gap or void--some previous
erasure?--they erase themselves.  This translates with more slippery
consequences, I think, than those poems which "ethically" describe/reflect
an erasureful or fragmented world in an erasureful or fragmented way.  For
one, it implicates the writer/maker-of-things in the
fall/corruption/breakage; the writer is inescapably held responsible,
too...the "helplessness" or "impossibility" of the writer to honestly
write in anything *but* fragments &/or erasures seems, somehow, more
genuine & horrifying to me here--where those who are hell-bent on helping
(read: writing in whitespaceless sentences) and "equipped," they think, to
do so, end up helpless, too...and this *process* is recorded/enacted.

Small Press Tafffic presents

"Frank O'Hara and Coterie"
a talk by Lytle Shaw

Friday, December 11, 7:30 p.m.
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street, Room 11
$5

Shaw's work on Frank O'Hara examines his career as a way to recast debates
about the politics of reference and community within 1950s and early 60s
American poetry and art. This talk will begin with what has been the most
common problem for readers of O'Hara-the charge that, because his poems
prominently feature obscure proper names, he is merely a coterie poet. By
unpacking the social and linguistic implications of O'Hara's systems of
poetic reference, Shaw situates O'Hara's practice of coterie writing 1)
against a tradition of modern poetry and poetry criticism for which proper
names should reference canonical sites of knowledge or structures of myth
and 2) beyond familiar oppositions between particularity and universality.
Don't worry, he'll explain!

Lytle Shaw is a poet and scholar, author of many critical publications on
contemporary poetry and theory. His own poetry has appeared in many
journals including Lyric&, Non, Log, Idiom, Explosive, and Mirage
#4/Period[ical], and in three forthcoming books. With Emilie Clark he edits
the journal of pre-poetics, Shark.

Emily,

Thank you for your wonderful posts [after reading them once, I've had to
save them for later savoring]. Anent erasure, two things: first, the
first section from Anselm Hollo's "four stills from _the poet_ / for Tom
Raworth" [in _Maya_], for me a locus classicus re erasure:

_the poet, drunk, is seen
composing a poem to the revolutionaries
of the world._

it is to be a long poem.

while working on page 9 he realizes
that he is stone cold sober:
he stops, goes back,
reads what he has written
starts crossing out words --
lines -- sections --
whole pages.

one line remains,
on page five.  it says:

_the heroes, their mouths full of_

it is not
a very good line.  maybe
he only forgot to cross it out.
we cannot
ask him.
he has fallen asleep.


[<<27 years ago, I performed -- no doubt in much the same state -- a
similar service for the esteemed Finn; I hope he has forgiven me>>]

Second: my sonnetoidal "Isotope" poems, which I began to write in August,
1997 [based on anagrams of 4x4 wordsquares I construct] result from a
kind of erasure of all but 14 of the possible combinations of the 16
letters in each wordsquare which form lines of words. In each case, I
work with a complete and finite set of such lines [usually several
thousand]. In the "Isotopes," though, one can restore all the erased
elements by taking any of the remaining lines and running it through an
anagram generator -- so, in a sense, they constitute a ratour sans
ratour, a presence signalling or floating upon a determinate absence. I
hadn't thought of them in this way until I'd begun to 'wind up the golden
ball' of this erasure thread, but it helps me to scope out [theodolize]
the 4x4iverse. Muchas gracias, amiga.

to answer your first question,

Ci Xi was the Empress Dowager of China.  She is generally considered to
have ruled China from the 1870s through till her death, in the first
decade of 20th century.  She is accused of having wasted money which was
supposed to be spent on the construction of a navy on adornments to her
pleasure garden at the summer palace, thus, the marble steamboat.  The
traditional Confucian view is that when women rule the state there is
disaster, so in this view (which the Communists have partially bought
into, being good patriotic Chinese) it was her reactionary,
obscurantist, corrupt, etc, rule that the western powers were able to
defeat, control, humiliate, etc, China.  otherwise, the Brits would
never have won the opium war, there would have been no foreign
concessions, the boxers would have succeeded in expelling all foreigners
from China, etc, etc.  journalist Sterling Seagraves has a book (DRAGON
LADY) which attempts to debunk some of these stereotypes about Ci Xi but
of course being mere journalism it has problems of its own.

the marble steamboat is quite pleasant.  it doesn't actually float, and
is adjacent to the shore, so it lacks that feeling of being on the open
waters, but it is a delightful monument and much better than the real
fleet that the money was actually spent on (by Li Hongchang) and which
the Japanese sank in 1895.

This version of erasure is the closest I've read so far about the erasing
that seems
to have struck much pop culture as of late:  to take a set of conditions and
remove
some element in order to define the reconfigured result.

The X-Men at Marvel are recently finding what it means to live as if
Wolverine never
was made; One of Buffy's friends wished the Slayer had never come to town on
this
week's episode; this weekend Xena will learn what the world would be like if
she
had never quested for power but stayed in her little village for life.
Soon, Scrooge
will be popping up to be erased for seasonal festivities.

I think this cultural obsession stems from more than just wanting to know
how much
we'll be missed.  Of course, the implications abound, but specifically, and
I have not
thought about this thoroughly yet, but this erasing seems to be about
measuring
"power" by erasing a presence to reveal the places that presence affected.
The
gaps
get filled in, but by what?  The wrench in the monkey is that we all know
that
someone was here, now she's gone but let's pretend she never was.  Buffy's
writers did a poor job because she still popped up in the town she wasn't
supposed to ever come to.  She filled in her own gaps.

But I am far more interested in this kind of erasing as a technique I have
never
consciously tried within poetry, aside from editing out to avoid being
expository
in my work.  I've heard about poets writing about a topic without using
words
that define or reveal that topic
but what about the "What if it was here and I've removed it" practices?
Does anyone know of work that plays with those implications, not as random
word erasing, or am I simply
being too abstract/oblique here?

I don't honestly see HG as the ghost here, any more than others come and
gone. Lists change all the time; the oddity is that Poetics changed so
little for so long. Populations pass through them. There are others who
have left here out of chagrin, and I've had to go off from time to time
as a result of overflowing mailboxes.

Meanwhile, one might look at instances of _the disappearing woman,_ which
form a matr/ix covering a great deal of ground (metaphysical and other-
wise). Not only Lilith as an obvious case (the doubled Eve creation in
B'rashit), but also Melies' use of _the sawed woman_ or _disappearances_
of women by magicians. From there through Patty Hearst, so much narrative
depends on this disappearance and suturing (and think of Irigaray's in-
stance of the woman as a _transitive function_ or other between the same/
same relations among men - not to mention functions of 'wife-swapping'
(never called 'husband-swapping'), etc.).

With Heidegger, Derrida, with Freud's absent answer to 'what does woman
want,' with Lacan's lack, and so forth (think again of the absence of
pubic hair on all those classical statues), it is the woman/womyn, that is
turned-aside, as if in embarrassment. In erasure, there is this political
context, then, political economy. It's a deeper/other level than that of
erasing a drawing or a text or obscuring part of a work, which in fact
might even be said to operate precisely as suture, making the world safe
for absence. (To say this is not to make it so, of course - I am only
pointing out that erasure doesn't necessarily carry liberation, but in
fact can be politically problematic. Randomly erasing a text is one thing;
randomly erasing people, say in Stalinist Russia, is another. In any case
erasure is loaded, is overdetermined in so many ways.)

i've read _The Invention of Solitude_ and _Leviathian_ and none of his
poetry. Both of these works, the former a meditation on his father and a
strange altered family photo, the latter about a man(1) who retraces how a
man(2) who has blown himself up has affected this man's (1,3) (love) life,
are mighty erasurly. maybe my fortune cookie was right: Absence makes the

STOP IMPEACHMENT!   Call the Capitol Switchboard for FREE:

1-877-TO-MOVEON (1-877-866-6836)
   December 9, 10, 11
   Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
======================================================================

The House leadership is rushing to IMPEACH the President before the newly
elected Congress is sworn in, on a purely partisan vote.  THE VOTE WILL BE
VERY CLOSE.  If they succeed, the nation will be paralyzed for months as the
President is put on trial in the Senate.

You can prevent this.

   (1) CALL 1-877-TO-MOVEON (1-877-866-6836)
       to be connected to your representative for FREE
   (2) Alert your friends and colleagues by forwarding this message
   (3) Get others to call 1-877-TO-MOVEON this week -- talk to them
       personally
   (4) Click on http://www.moveon.org/actionplus.htm so we can count your
       call and report totals to the press.

For just three days, December 9th through December 11th, we have arranged
for FREE long distance calls direct to Capitol Hill.  We need to make
Congress understand the nation's passionate opposition to this cynical and
destructive use of the impeachment process.  Everyone must call.  Call toll
free 1-877-TO-MOVEON (1-877-866-6836) to reach the Capitol Hill switchboard
and ask for your representative.  If you get a busy signal, try again or use
the direct numbers given above.  The direct D.C. number is better for
lobbying, but will cost a few dimes.

Tell your friends and colleagues about 1-877-TO-MOVEON.  They can just give
the operator their zip code to be transferred to their Member of Congress.
It's easy and FREE.

Once you reach your representative's office, let the staff member know
   (1) that you are a constituent (by giving your name and city)
   (2) that you are opposed to impeachment,
   (3) and that you expect Congress to immediately "MOVE ON" to important
       issues.
Express your own personal concerns and ask for a response from your
representative.

Click on http://www.moveon.org/actionplus.htm to do even more.  We've got to
act now.

Free calls are provided courtesy of Working Assets Long Distance
(http://www.wald.com).  The 1-877-TO-MOVEON action line will be active from
December 9 to December 11, 1998 only.  You can call the congressional
switchboard at any time directly at 1-202-224-3121.

Subject:      Re: Erasing

Hi all
I thing there are two possible strands at work in this erasure discussion
(well there are others , but two that I want to address), The first is
erasure to make a poem more permeable, transparent in parts which invite the
reader to fill in (or fall in)  and it is true that some poems are
accessible because of what has been omitted, or erased, but left visible
below the text.  The second is the idea of compression which I think is
different and often creates an impermeable wall forcing the reader to accept
the writers  images.  In our own minds erasure is non selective, but I am
always intrigued at the quotes I remember, I think seamlessly only to find
words missing or transposed.

I am very interested in accessibility in writing and it is the transparent
quality of language used which creates the eye kick and the immediacy
quotient, but that is selected through choice, and selection implies
erasure.  And how much can be taken away before meaninglessness takes over
or does it ever?  Perhaps the spacial quality of words means that there will
always be a  gestalt forced on the reader.

Jim

The Buffy episode is a parody of It's a Wonderful Life (thus the Xmas

For me, the erasing and censorship/moderation threads are aligned.  This,
I hope, is the last time I will post on this subject so I will go for full
disclosure.

In November, still in the first frolics of having joined this list, full
of high jinks and excitement and pleasure in relation to all the talk
about poetry, and the notion of so many hundreds of experimenting poets
out there, I jumped into a bout of silliness initiated by Roger Day, I
think, on the subject of Mars Bars (Yes Jonathan).  Well, I'm Irish and I
get lonely (but don't get me started again).  I noticed that the
contributors to this "thread" or "filament" were noticeably British /
Irish / Canadian: yes, I for one was indulging in a bit of a canter in
very few words.  A post of eight words brought me the following message:

Date: Sat, 07 Nov 1998 13:57:26 -0500(EST)
From: Poetics List <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu
To: mbyrne@ithaca.edu
Subject: advisory notice

This is an advisory notice from the administration of the Poetics List to
remind you to keep posts to the list close to the focus of the list as
indicated in the Welcome Message.  Thanks for your cooperation.

On November 10, I posted  reference to this notice to another
"frolicking" thread -- the one about how Bill, Kent, David Baratier
etc were such nice guys and should be invited to *your* town to read:
Did they get advisory notices, I would ask, if the whole problematic of
asking questions on this list did not inhibit me.

Witness my next post (December 7) on the subject where I asked the
following 5 questions:

Is personality too raw for politics?
What do you guys really think about censorship/moderation?
Have any of you received warnings?
How many of you have been in the doghouse?
Are you still on the list and why?

None of my questions received an answer, except perhaps from Charles
Bernstein who has said that very few advisory notices of any kind have
been sent out in the history of the list.  This does not make me feel
better.

Is the list able to tolerate banter from some people and not from others?
My question in relation to advisory notices was intended to draw forth the
legions waving their notices.  None came forward.  Charles says advisory
notices are hard to come by.  I got one.  Why?  My banter worse than
anyone else's?  In what way?  Why?

Erasure: certainly I feel that conversation/argument/ and yes, the
second most favorite word after "enervated": rhetoric, takes place over my
head.  The Gabe/Henry/Kent controversy, consisting as it did of many long,
wordy,outraged paragraphs (if we were lucky) attracted many more long,
wordy, outraged paragraphs, mainly from men.

I am doubly miffed: miffed at being censured, miffed at being erased.
I STAND UP HERE AMONG YOU IN CAPITALS.  But then I remember my previous
dedication to the one-member society of unimportance.  And I remember the
kindly and thoughtful back-channels I have received from Eliza and
Rosalie. And I remember that I like Gabe/Henry/Kent for making me laugh.
And I like the list for making me think, putting me in touch with people,
helping me towards certain books.  But please, can I make a plea for a
form of *listening*, even within our posts.  I too believe this is a
performative space, and I am totally behind Joseph Beuys.  But guys, you
talk too much.  You see length, yes surprise surprise size, as the
important thing.  There must be other ways of playing this game.

In the spirit of communication, I have translated what I wanted to say
into the type of longish message favored by this list. To adopt another
strategy favored here, I will say that:

1. Ego is not the only form of transport for ethical issues.
2. Language is at our disposal: let us play.
3. Personality is at our disposal: let us be human.
4. Editorial censure would be better received if it were not
   anonymous and unsigned.
5. This medium is new: let us play.
6. Long live the backchannel.
7. Women: speak out.

I always enjoy Alan Sondheim's posts, and his post of today got me started
on this.  My interest in a narrative, no matter how funny, which demands
my disappearance, is bound to be limited.  I will be dead long enough.

Dear Emily (and list)

Thank you for posting your (essay?) anti-criticism, re appraisal.  I found
it stimulating and innovative.  It echoes thoughts I have had for some time,
and which have grown from discussions.  Fortunately I never attempted to
group these thoughts together, I say fortunately, because I do not think I
could have produced anything like the depth of your piece.


I would ask, (in general, so not necessarily related to sex)  if the use of
specialized language, jargon or argot, has the effect of marginalising, and
whether the introduction of the definitions or use of the words from common
vocabularies albeit with differing definitions actually helps in the process
of general acceptability or normalising because people will find a common
word out of context or in a different context easier to interpret?.

mairead, i like your seven points... may i add a friendly amendment to item 4?

to wit, and just a draft:

4.  Moderation by listowner (or designee) would be better rec'd if
frontchannel, signed, employed only in the most dire of controversies, and
good-spirited.  List members should likewise do their utmost to avoid
flaming, and to be receptive of different agenda.

i assume we all know the difference twixt flames and dry ice... i'm not
sure if some of this isn't already in the poetics "welcome message" (too
lazy to check), but just for the sake of conversing...

best,

Your quote of Kenneth Tynam I suppose was intended to be self-mocking, since
your contributions to the list as far as I have been aware have been entirely
in the realm of literary criticism. Before your next post, I hope you will
consider not only where you are going but how, as I get the sense you are too

good, is fine.  But let's cut out the backhanded high-handed under-handed

sorry mairead
i got an advisory b/c about the same issue and i thought i had wrestled the
candy bar into a stanza
to wit

in new york in august we kept our mars bars in the freezer, break them with
a hammer, yum, cold and sweet, no gooey. the more delicate saw a slice off
with a serrated knife, let the cool chocolate melting lubricate their
murderous thoughts
 and i responded f/c with another pome
which i seem to have lost right now
and you even responded appreciatively so i thought you understood we were
in the same doghouse
i've been an activist all of my adult life and know how
anger can poison my days and even effect those i least want to burden so if
i can deal with it right away and transmute that energy into something
useful like a poem or comic relief, turning that anger into pride enables
me to protect my associates, i thought joel was a little overzealous but i
could see he was anxious about his relocation and how it would affect his
relationship with charles and his stewardship of the list so i shrugged and
got a little solidarity note i thought b/c from you. I remember Bowering
posted on this as well and i wondered at the time if he got a note from
joel but i never asked just switched my allegiance to o henry bars.

I have been in absentia for a bit, I want to get to some scene reports
but first a number of things to say--

First, has anybody seen the new Georgia Review, I understand they
reviewed one of Pavement Saw's titles _Wherever You Want_ by Douglas
Goetsch & I am unsure of what their words were.

Second, when I visited APR I was amazed to find out that they too ran a
fully anonymous submission process, and for the Honickman award they too
ended up with a new comer who only had three credits in little
magazines. As a plug, one of these fine magazines, Nedge, is run by our
former list member Henry Gould. Yet another nail in the coffin of my
theory that anonymous competitions result in publishing unknown/rarely
published talent.

Third, for Ron Silliman, I understand there was question posed a few
weeks back about people upholding the Language movement and not to see a
response from Ron seemed odd. I say this because a few weeks ago when I
went to hear Rae A. read at Penn for some unknown reason the
introduction consisted of Ron emphasizing that Rae was a Language poet.
While I was hoping for an articulation of why he found her work
scintillating, instead he spent his time reifying that she was a
language poet through saying it over and over again without
justification as to why. Such statements as "while her lines are
different than most people associated with the movement, she is a
language poet" were offered as clarification. I found this quite
baffling for a movement that has prided itself on its use of theory in
and about poetry. I still am curious as to why Ron thought this type of
introduction was necessary.

As for this debate about people leaving, and the questions presented, I
have been on for at least three years maybe four and have never received
a warning. I have not always been active on the list for this duration
either. Censorship or perceived censorship is a wonderful conduit for
writing. What can be better than emotionally charging or intellectually
challenging one to action? Even if the action is to leave this list and
transit to another stable of writers. If one feels they are in strife or
opposition with one particular sect, it fuels something, preferably new.
Perhaps I sparked a few things which could be considered doghouse
material, esp. when first starting. I am on the list because little
attention is paid to Language and Language influenced material outside
of the two coasts. I want to be aware of the rare flares of excellent
material. Being aware of who the popular practicioners of the movement
are also allows me to pick up the books in the cut out bins of Ohio and
sell them for a profit when heading coastward.

Be well

it is firmly my belief that all words reference. (i.e. we cannot get away
from the denotative & connotative signifying functioning of language,
though we can--thankfully--disrupt those in many & delightful ways.) i
cannot speak for lyn hejinian, but i would be shocked if she subscribed to
the belief that she does not mean her words to mean. this is not to say
that she (or any other poet) means her words to mean for you what they mean
for her, or even that we believe our words to mean now what they will or
might mean tomorrow, or etc. questioning (or challenging or exploring) the
signifying function of language, and the politics of such, is not the same
thing as abandoning signification (were that even possible).

i find it much more useful to think of langpo as a historical moment,
involving certain players (hejinian among them, along with many others
whose initial alleged L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E texts can be found in the delightful
anthology of that very name edited by bernstein & andrews) rather than a
homogenized ideology or poetics that binds these very diverse writers
together. like any historical moment, especially one well-documented
textually, langpo has vast & varied reverberations. plus gives young folk
like myself the option of calling ourselves "post-language" which, to my
ear, is rather delightful.

& while my virtual mouth is open (which it rarely is for reasons already
mentioned by the much-appreciated likes of juliana spahr & elizabeth
treadwell) i'll mention this about _my life_: according to the biographical
notes at the end of the sun & moon volume, "Hejinian further explored her
own past and autobiography (in _My Life_). Writing it in 1978, in her 37th
year, Hejinian constructed a work of 37 sections of 37 sentences, each
section paralleling the year of her life. For the second Sun & Moon
edition, published eight years later, Hejinian added 8 sections and 8 new
sentences to each previous section to account for her current age."

when she added the new sentences, she did not just tack them onto the end
of each section, but rather interspersed them throughout the various
sections, thereby changing the resonances of some of what she had written
earlier. she did not allow herself to re-write the previously published
text, though i am pretty sure she cut out a few words here & there.

i hadn't posted on _my life_ earlier because i figured that many people
knew this information & would have already backchanneled maria; therefore,
if this is redundant, please forgive.

Am wondering if anyone on this list can point me to essays which analyze
the "Deep Image," particularly if such essays look at the
"movement" in an historical perspective -- i.e., by looking at the
magazines "Trobar" and/or "Pictures from the Floating World" and their
complicated relationship to/reconciliation of "outsider" poets like R.
Kelly and "academic" poets like James Wright.  You can backchannel me at
<dkane@panix.com>.  Much appreciated.

Also want to say that the book _Close Listening_, ed. Charles Bernstein
and published by Oxford University Press, is just terrific -- smart essays
dealing (finally!) with and exploring the fact that poetry is experienced
as a spoken and social thing as much as a read thing.  Anyone know if
there are essays looking at the potential effects of stage fright on
reception of a given poem?

they are objects for me, they reek of flesh gone sour
i would be a lichen to their rock, corroding their violent granite
they would kill everyone with guns and they are all white men
every last one of them, no matter what drear affirmation
white men filled with dead pus: they stomp the children of the poor,
rape pollution laws, guarantee we'll drown the world in poison.
we're raped with rusted guns from world war two three four
while they fight the righteous fight against women sex longing
holding dead children on sticks to slap us with, banner banner
big money big money
i couldn't stand to party with righteousness
i couldn't stand to fuck righteousness but their holes are closed
they have no holes, shit leaks from their mouths,
piss leaks from their eyes, they write vomit
they are a real danger, never forget this, behind words
are guns and mobs and real men, you never forget a real man
when you look into his dead dead eyes, when you see a Republican

What small press publishers are actively publishing & reading

the last few weeks during the muck & suck of poeticslist's growing
pains, Ive been simultaneously recovering a ms which I began while in
high school.  It is the first book of what eventually became a long poem
in 17 books called SAMSARA CONGERIES.  it is really the only work of
mine which remains unpublished because no one publishes long poems
anymore.  the section I am at work on now is called RAW. SWAY. ALOUD.
and derives from an obituary I found on microfiche in the local
Wisconsin Rapids Tribune.  This natty little obit was the gem that
inspired the whole complex of volumes.  About a very modern Modoc man
named Shacknasty Jack:

SHACKNASTY JACK
A touching obituary notice

        Again we are called upon to perform the painful duty of announcing the
death of one who, if not altogether [word unknown, blotted out] was
chief among a fraction of thousands of spirits who are not yet perfect.
We refer to "Shacknasty Jack," the genial, whole-souled, or perhaps
(considering his mixed parentage) we would say, half-souled,
copper-colored gentleman, who recently died peacefully and in pieces, in
his little lava bed.  Jack, "poor fel," did not wrap what little drapery
he had about him and lie to pleasant dreams, but his demise was hastened
by a seven-inch shell that entered and exploded in his diaphragm,
ruining his digestive apparatus that had never been disturbed by
banquets of roast dog, salt horse, washed down by copious draughts of
fiery, untamed benzine and needlegun whiskey.  As we recall the virtues
of the deceased, our pen unconsciously drifts into mourning, and we are
led to exclaim:

Oh Shacknasty, thou hast left us,
        No more horses wilt thou steal;
But twas Gillem that bereft us,
        He can all our sorrows heal.

First we heard it was old Schnochin,
        The heard twas Scar-Faced Charles
But the latest news, Shacknasty,
        Says tis you have quit the earth's snarles,
                Gone, but not forgotten.

        Friends of the family invited to attend—covered carriages for all who
wear gloves.
        Born of poor but honorable parents, "Jack" manifested at an early ago
those traits that in after years made him famous, and would in time have
sent him to Congress if his soul had not been shelled out of his
ephemeral shell by a cast of iron namesake.  He had served his tribe as
tax collector, president of the baseball club, and was about organizing
a "YOUNG RED MEN'S HORSE PLAGIARIZING ASSOCIATION," when he felt a
sensation of goneness of the pit of the stomach, and was gone.
Possessing many of the virtues that marked the Credit Mobelier
operators, Shacknasty was almost as generous as the increased salary
voters, who oly drew their back salary to pay off the public debt, and
the news of his sudden death will cause a thrill of anguish in many a
bosom—anguish that he was not permitted to die longer and slower by
inches.

This obit spurred me, then a curious high school lad, to research the
life of this man & perhaps write thru his words & the transliterated
Modoc language, a poetic fantasy of what his life must have been.  After
contacting the Modoc tribal roll (they had been moved to Norman, OK from
the lava beds of Eureka area of northern CA) I discovered that according
to them no one had ever existed by that name.  As far as I was
concerned, all the better.  I later came to the conclusion that he was
the portmanteau creation of 2 other well know Modoc personalities,
Shacknasty Jim & Captain Jack.



All of the above is simply to preface the question, to all those who
have created their own history of texts, how do they honor their own
lost, forgotten, neglected mss, particularly ones from another time &
place, texts that are informed by another time's poetics, a different
school of poetry & most certainly a past generation's dreams? --

still wrinkling my thoughts for ways to make a poetics of hypertext
project manifest front channel....as an exploration in a semi public
workgroup.  one of the most encourage list experiences Ive had of late
was watching the texts stream thru the poetics etc list, completely
taking advantage of the broadcast nature of a list, sort of an editorial
voyeurism, but more provocative.  the key factor for me is that there
has to be a concrete & accessible body of work that comes out of it.
most probably a mini-website, as archives are not useable as a
functional group hypertext.

I feel weird about this, because I'm unclear on whether it constitutes an
uncouth "frontching" of a backch--plus, I didn't save the bc and now must
paraphrase.  BUT, David, the sequence: Simon mentioned Hejinian as a
L=A=N=G poet; I mentioned that I didn't think so; he asked why & who
was if not she; I tried to answer re: Hejinian but (frontch) deferred to
someone like Ron or anyone more in the know as to who IS because (this is
what I wrote) I don't know exactly who identifies as a L=A=N=G poet.  Ron
backchanneled that he didn't think anyone "identified as a Language poet"
but that it was a label sort of externally foisted on certain writers, and
that Hejinian's recent work is certainly as languagey as any language
poet's.

I didn't write back to Ron; I really just don't know enough.  It was my
impression that some folks got together and this eventually culminated
in, among other things,_The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book_--a book that included
folks that identified as L=A=N=G poets.  I thought perhaps Ron's different
spelling/version, "language poet" might stand for the more casual
slung-around use of the word that has developed since those early yrs, and
that people didn't identify as language poets, but perhaps some identify
as L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets (although I'd always used the "equal sign"
spelling in my frontch posts).  I took it that Ron meant either that, or
that I was dead wrong (entirely possible; I read _The L=A=etc. Book_ very
long ago), and that it never *was* at some point a conscious "movement" or
"set of ideas" or "set of people."

At the time I didn't know why Ron backchanneled that response, as it was
Simon who originally wanted to know "who the L=A=N=G poets are, if not
Hejinian."  Since it seemed designed to inform and not to "get personal,"
I don't think it's wrong, or too wrong, to paraphrase it here, now...

DEAR HILLARY RODHAM WHATEVER SIGRETTI:

No, you cannot expect your messages necessarily to reach the list.  Henry
had two that were erased because they did not pass muster and I have had
one that has disappeared from my screen this afternoon and has not
resurfaced in this esteemed and ringing piazza, and yeah it's a little
fucking irksome, nor furthermore has my POLITE query about where in
Ultima Thule my post went been answered.

Wondering if you'll get this,

Daniel,
       You should search the POETICS archive. I have a memory of
Jerry Rothenberg who is on the list posting something on the term.
Robert Kelly I remember as a list member although not heard from for

Simon,

as a poet intensely fascinated by urban spaces & structures, here are =
some books I've found most helpful & interesting:

City of Quartz by Mike Davis
Flesh & Stone: The Body and the City in Western Civilization by Richard =
Sennett (Sennett in general good read)
Cities by Lawrence Halprin
Design of Cities by Edmund N. Bacon
Angst: Cartography by Mojdeh Baratloo & Clifton J. Balch
The Life & Death of Great American Cities by Jane Alexander (not sure on =
author name, someone stole my book,as it is irresistable read)
Lost Cities by Vittoria Calvani
Architecture without Architects by Bernard Rudofsky (not precisely on =
urban planning, but I think deals with unexpected urban beauty)
The Built, the Unbuilt and the Unbuildable, by Robert Harbison
Big City Primer, John Yau
Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino
Paris Peasant, Louis Aragon

There was some eco-magazine out for a while, Terra Verde? Terra Infirma? =
Can't remember exact name, but had some great essays on particular urban =
topics, especially in one issue called "Wild City." There was also a =
feminist magazine (I'll try & look it up--scribbled it down somewhere) =
in the 80s that has a super issue on women & urban spaces--really =
interesting essay on woman who designed gardens in Washington DC, =
counterpoint to huge pointy monuments...

And a digression: on the whole List debate, I am a digester & mostly =
lurker who frequently deletes the entire thing unread, so missed the =
initial sparks. But somehow this resultant explosion has opened up the =
List more for me--made me feel that it is growling & moving, even if =
every step is not perfect for everybody. I haven't reconciled how I feel =
about someone being cut off the list, but must admit that the list now =
feels less monotonous, more names, voices cropping up here & there, more =
breathing space

 Dear Emily,
                Ron Silliman also frontchannelled along related lines
Nov.18. when he referred to a Poetry Flash of 1979 as the first use
of the 'language poets' label. That sort of  local knowledge is
invaluable. My first encounter was in 1980 when I bought 6 issues of
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine from Sandollar books. Ron doesn't refer
to the magazine,  which pre-dates the Poetry Flash issue and is
surely the source for the label. ( The L=book is of course an
anthology of pieces from the (by that time defunct) magazine.) The
equal signs between the letters stretch serve to stretch the title
across the top of the front cover

Lyn Hejinian contributed to number 3, (1978), no 7 (1979), is a
featured writer in number (1979 and she  is reviewed in number 11
(1980) and number 13 (1980) in which Bernadette Mayer review's My
Life.  In  so far as the contributors to the magazine made up a
community of shared interests, she is clearly a member of that
community. To identify that community by the name of the magazine
between whose covers they were gathered seems quite reasonable to me.

Wystan

Dear Gabriel,
      This  so-called Slapstick Poetics of yours, it really seems to
have made an impact. I'm not sure I quite grasp it, as you have had
precious little to say theoretically about it. But let me try it
myself and you can tell me how I'm going,ok?:

Gabriel Gudding is an abusive, insulting, humourless, garrulous no-
count poseur  ( I'm sure I wrote  poster?) so say some people. Not
frontchannel mind you. And not me. I love him. He's so fine.

Some say his failed attempts at humour which simply end up giving
gratuitous  offence is doing  damage to the sense of community on
which the success of the list depends. But not me. I did not say it.
I did not. I love him. He is an honourable man. Others say his posts
are hilarious, challenging, cheeky. Not me, however.

Is this how it goes, Gabe? And where does it go from here? I am not
sure of the point of saying gross, stupid, things about a person and
then nice approving things about them, except that it is rather
liberating and such fun and gets up people's noses, so perhaps you
could go into this in more depth. Thanks.

Wystan

Subject:      miss priss speaks up (ahem)

ok, i've been saying this backchannel, i think a bit frontchannel, but i'll
say it straight out now and those of you who disagree or feel pointed at are
welcome to email me about it.

1) alan s. and i have discussed this a bit -- those of you who feel
this list is in some sort of terrible shape, awash in censorship, mean
posts, etc., you are being awfully spoiled and naive.  this isn't a
 bad thing -- people who are demanding (even if because from privilege
and naivete,) while annoying, are often helpful -- their demands and
expectations help set and keep up standards.  but as a quick reality
moment, in my not-even-that-extensive list experience, poetics is a
HAVEN of subject-focused, intelligent, witty, pleasant posts.  i have
NEVER seen flames of the ilk i've seen elsewhere.  without verbatim
quoting, suffice to say i've seen other lists/bulletin boards with
posts of MUCH lower levels, routinely, despite other posters of
erudition and charm; i'm talking about posts with vitriolic,
namecalling, swearing, just plain dumb/missing logic and schoolyard
rhetoric.  and i mean schoolyard, as in "you *%$(*&^% )%$(* your
mother is a )@#)(*."  if you have difficulty believing this, take a
few hours and browse around on poetry bbs and listserves.  this list
is amazing; please stop selling it short.

2) i am just plain sick and utterly tired of the backchannel,
backstabbing, cowardly complaining going out to charles/joel.  if you
have a beef with someone's post, instead of writing joel and charles
about how someone is a blah blah blah and their posts are blah blah
blah and please revoke their membership to the country club and we
wouldn't want the kaffirs getting the wrong idea and heavens they're
offending the mem sahib, just, for heavens sake, get a spine and write
the person whose posts bug you DIRECTLY telling them their posts bug
you and why.  i.e. start a dialogue with the person you have a problem
with and take responsibility, up front, for what bothers you.  there
is more than one person on this list with whom i have done this and
i've never had an impossibly terrible experience.  in some cases, i've
made a new friend.  in all but one case, poster and i came out of it
with each having gotten some insight.  it is totally unfair,
burdensome, and i'm sorry, but i think, cowardly and irreponsible to
pester joel and charles with these sorts of complaints.  i could see
it in case of actual danger -- at one point on this list, someone was
sending mailbombs, both to list, and when i wrote them about something
else, to me.  that is the one contrary instance.  in that case, i did
drop a note to j&c to the effect that so and so was mailbombing not
just list, but me.  joel and charles both got very upset and
immediately wrote to make suggestions and offer support.  that is the
only situation i can think of at moment when i would complain,
backchannel, privately, to them about something i might not take up
directly with person offending me.

this complaining about so and so's posts not being up to scratch to
charles and joel just reminds me of the gossip and throatcutting of a
petty middleclass country club.  having had a peripatetic
(metaphorically) childhood, i have had occasion to see a group of
petty bourgois, as one example, debating whether so-&-such REALLY
belonged in club because at s&s's party, toward the end of the
evening, someone saw s&s pouring store-brand liquor into namebrand
bottles.  said group delegated someone to complain to manager of club.
can anything be more petty and disgusting?  if so, i have no wish to
hear about it.

just as in that instance, i probably would have asked s&s if they had
run out and would like me to make a liquor run if i thought that was
the case, or if i thought they just didn't want to waste expensive
alcohol on drunken people, or didn't have the money to spend, shrugged
and left it alone so, in the instance of posts one doesn't like, there
are, as has been said, numerous simple remedies.  we don't have to be
suburban and complain they are "ruining the neighborhood"; the delete
key is democratic and available to all.  or one can discuss the matter
directly with person involved -- life is open to varied and multiple
interpretations, no?  do you ALWAYS know what someone meant, exactly,
by a post?  lacan/deconstruction/lacan/deconstruction...

3) more than once, i've heard complaints and distress by women.
things it revolves around are a) post by woman being ignored by
subsequent male posters, or issues therefrom being attributed to
another poster (male); b) long windy posts appearing to exist
primarily to quash and abash female poster-of-origin on topic, or
respondant; c) posts dismissive of women and women's issues.  i've
heard it enough that i believe it.  i speak from some abashment as a
frequent poster (am perhaps inherently a noisy, tough lot) but even
so, have much sympathy for other, less thick-skinned sisters.  and am
saddened and pained by each gentle, sad note i have received (and
there have been many) backchannel thanking me for posting on thus and
such (especially women's issues, but also by newbies) and mentioning a
personal difficulty/diffidence/ discomfort that prevents frontchannel
mention.

suggestions: all (not just men), could we be more sensitive to source
of issues/questions/posts?  careful not to misattribute/obliterate
anyone's (especially women's) portion of debate in issue?  an effort
to respond not just to the windy, like me, but the shy and short
posters?  an effort to be especially welcoming to women/newbie
posting?

as a subnote, there is among women (i think anyway) an elaborate and
exquisite ritual of mutually affirming sarabande, of placing any
critique/comment in a context of affirmation, compliment, reassurance.
i would refer you all, for particularly adroit and lovely examples of
this, to any post by maria damon.  i think for women, one learns to be
careful and respectful.  for some, what feels like normal posting may
feel, to women, like rude and dismissive and disrespectful response.
all i can say is, whenever i read a maria damon post, i invariably
feel soothed, interested, and utterly awed by her grace.  could we all
try to take on some of that care and respect?  i'd love to see this
tendency toward carefulness used to elevate and better posting, rather
than dismissed.


the lovely and gracious and noisy and always-perfect

Gotcha.  I owe you an apology, Simon (and whoever else listened):
Hejinian's a L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet. Plus, I've just heard bc that she
refers to herself as one to this day.  Sorry if I misled or put you on the
defensive.  And thanks, Wystan, for clearing it up.

I'm a smidgen loathe to post this, since I'm not otherwise taking part in
discussions lately, and also because I posted heaps of Big Allis information
several months ago, but as it was especially requested (and I'm thrilled by
the interest), here goes.

The initial contact for subscriptions and related matters is me:

Eurydice@aol.com

The initial contact for submissions and related matters is:
Melanie Neilson
11 Scholes Street
Brooklyn, NY 11206

As for contents--the most recent issue, Big Allis 8 (lukewarm of the presses),
featues a selection of work by writers in Great Britain and Ireland (guest
edited by Fiona Templeton), namely: Caroline Bergvall, Karlien van den Beukel,
Andrea Brady, Miles Champion, Ken Edwards, David Kinloch, Sarah Law, Tertia
Longmire, Helen Macdonald, Rob McKenzie, Drew Milne, Catherine Walsh, John
Wilkinson, and Aaron Williamson. The other contributors to this issue are:
Bruce Andrews, Graham Foust, Bob Harrison, Noah de Lissovoy, Alison Lune,
Heather Ramsdell, Lisa Robertson and Christine Stewart, Juliana Spahr,
Stephanie Strickland, H. T. (Heather Thomas), Rodrigo Toscano, and Liz
Waldner.

A single issue is $8 (there was a special "poetics et alia" offer through
Halloween for $6--which could perhaps be extended through the upcoming
holidays if someone asks), and a two-issue subscription is $16.

I think that covers all the bases. Many thanks to Patrick for the enquiry.
(Considering throwing my hat into one other fray or another some evening when
there's more hours in the day.)

Ah! wish there was such a work -- been trying to get a grad student to do a
diss on exactly this subject for years now. But it hasn't happened yet, and I
don't know of anything specifically on DI except for bits and pieces here and
there, for example some of the early pages in Paul Christensen's book on
Eshleman.
    What you can however get ahold of is the raw material, i.e. the essays &
correspondence re Deep Image. Essential in looking at that event is however
the fact that what you call the "outsider", i.e. Robert Kelly (& Jerome
Rothenberg. whom you don't mention) were in fact the "insiders" (Yes, I know
how you are using the term in your query) : "Deep Image" as an _appellation
controlée _was taken over after the fact (& the brief duration) of the
initial burst of thought & writing about that idea by the "academics" like
James Wright -- & this happened, I believe, via the one outsider momentarily
close the the original DI poets, namely Iron John hisself. The hijacking of
the name (which the original conceivers of the trademark had indeed by then
if not renounced, at least left behind as not only being of limited use qua
poetics but also because of an unease or unwilligness to create a 'movement'
with the usual avant-gardish manifestos, etc.) has now gone down in lit-crit
so that references in trad lit histories (if indeed they do mention it) to DI
will cite the latter pale imitators.

    So that, the texts needed to look at to get a sens of DI are indeed
foremost the issues of Trobar & Floating World. The first issue (1960) of
Trobar, for ex., is poetry rather than statement (i.e. the horses rightfully
in front of the cart) and includes work by Antin, Duncan, Economou, Eshleman,
Kelly, Rothenberg & a few more.  Issue 2 (1961) has the same minus Antin plus
Rochelle Owens, Seymour Faust, Armand Schwerner and poets (only liminally or
not DI) such as Blackburn, Creeley, Dorn, Jones (now Baraka). It also has
Robert Kelly's statement "Notes on the Poetry of Deep Image." This statement
is a response to Rothenberg's  writing on Deep Image in issue # 2 of The
Floating World. Issue #3 of Trobar has a similar line-up of poets and
Rothenberg's  essay "Why _Deep_ Image?" Next important gathering on DI is in
Kulchur #6 which prints an exchange of letters between Rothenberg & Creeley
(reprinted in Rothenberg's volume of essays "Pre-Faces"). There were some
other letters (notably a Denise Levertov letter I have not been able to
locate).

    Issue #7 of VORT (the Antin/ Rothenberg issue) has excellent interviews
with both JR & DA that bring up the matter of DI. (It also prints a useful
essay by Kevin Power called "An Image is an Image is an Image" and Eric
Mottram's excellent "Where the Real Song Begins"). Vort #8 has a Schwerner
interview which also addresses AS's connections to & thinking about DI. Then
there is Robert Kelly's "Statement" from, I believe, 1968,  published as a
pamphlet by Black Sparrow.
Diane Wakowski, also an early DI participant, has a small essay called
"Jerome Rothenberg's Deep Image" -- and her Sparrow #3 issue, "Form is an
Extension of Content" also helps to configure the issue.

 That's all I have energy for tonight --

Ron I'm sure is accurate in identifying 1979 as first use of "language
poetry" (?language writing?) as a term for that poetry now known by that
name. I think, though, that the zine L=A=N etc started up in '78? There is
also Michael Davidson's title "The Poet as Language" for a piece he
published in _Credences_ zine in 1975 on the book _Tight Corners_ .

Btw, I assumed that it was L=A=N etc because of the care required to move
back and forth, typing, from uc to lc to uc, etc. That was token of a care
in reading same.

For clarification.
Thank you for the interesting information about Lanpo and esp the origins of
L=A=N
the symbol.  I realise that you were talking about the position of Lyn
Hejinian in aligning herself to a group with shared interests, but by the
same token of inclusively, does the same postulate mean there are no writers
who could be considered part of that "movement"  if not in the original mag?
Are they "Post-Lanpo" or "Post-L=A=N" etc.  Perhaps with the inclusion of
many of the experimental techniques in mainstream poetry collections, we
should use "After Lanpo" as a description, and save Post-Lanpo for the
cutting edge a-g.

Subject:      Readings in Austin / The Hat (if this gets through...)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

The second of our monthly readings took place on Saturday night in
Autin, Texas, with Roberto Tejada reading a selection of his work. His
investigation of "rhetoric" as a tool for expressing the greater
complexities of experience revealed a transmundane whisper within
physical objects worthy of critique and desire. He pastes passages from
Bataille next to the Joys of Cooking, from which he details the
evisceration of an eel, the soft belly revealed for gutting once the
surface-layer has been removed. He is a gracious reader, kind to his
audience even as his poetry borders the limits of Texan sensibilities.
Luckily, in the mouth, words move faster than many can comprehend. Such
is the depth of his imagination: powerful, 'real' and expressed at high
velocity.

Afterwards, of course, the usual rounds of tequila, beer and wine were
consumed in the unusual, "unseasonable" open air. Several of us decided
that evening to begin a reading group centered on Hamlet's Mill. Have
any of you listees read this book? I'll keep you posted on this series,
as it promises to make sense of apparently contradictory elements of
science and myth.

Finally, I wrote a post on Friday for delivery to the list, but through
some kind of intervention, it never arrived. It was a review of The Hat,
edited by Jordan Davis and Chris Edgar. I suggest checking it out
because this first issue is comprised only of women, having been
published by men. The quality of writing varies, but it is especially
interesting to read compared to the recent Moving Borders Anthology.

The writing in The Hat is motivated by various complex yankee anxieties
of who and what women are. J. Spahr's piece addresses the issue of
gender specific pronouns in the process of revealing a kind of "love"
poem to some equally, distant being bound in the process of internal
re-imagination. Her lines are expressed according to syllogistic logic,
direct but complicated by other syntactic "movements" of repetition and
rhetorical positions.

"So this," she writes, "is what is meant by the 'seeking that takes
       place between
prelanguaged and languaged states, before and behind the 'I.''"

And then a few lines later:

"Or I or he or she am or is trying
missing or mixing things up.
Thanks for the directions."

Juliana's insistent position that we examine and articulate the
complexity of gender and human construction is valiant, moreso since her
critique has tightend here, for me, becoming more direct and less
hesitant. Although firmly entrenched in the socio-cultural, her energy
appears to come from another place entirely, but other readers can
determine that for themselves.

With 20 pages, Kimberly Lyons receives the most space in this issue. The
poems are sharp, angular, focused on naturally occuring phenomena.
Objects lie in juxtapositions that create imaginative possibilities.
Some might find only colors and shades here; others only sentimental
attachments. But the phrasing and rhythm, the space around the lines--
these things create a radiation of event that swells up from within the
poem:

Trees fill
the window and
light
is thin, holds its dust.

On the bar
last night I saw
Three martinis,
trembling triangles.
Nancy said
this is the first time
I've felt happy.
big white trucks.
I guess everybody goes there
at least once.

The line breaks and injambment play with meaning. There's a strangeness
here that resists explanation. There's a sense of revelation without
opaque self-consciousness. You can see why the editors chose so many
pieces from her.

Janice Lowe address race directly in her poem, "The Summervilles of
Pickens County." She resists theorizing the assumptions and details of
racial encounter by addressing the details in language that live "in the
mouth." Although her use of the little 'i' is annoying, the coloquial
articulation of this poem builds a powerful address.

i tell the black ones calling me red
    you wanna be red like me nigger
the white ones
    you redder than me you gotdam cracker
all this is turning me
into a kind of peckerwood nigger
i don't like for people to be black and greasy at the same time
i prefer yellow women for lovemaking some have said
all my children have lightskinned mothers
of course i'm a race man

Witness the velocity of those lines, the build-up and speed. Like many
of the pieces in this collection, the concerns of the social are
delivered in a language that feels threaded to other agencies of
expression. This only complicates and increases the emotional
trajectories aimed against the dominate regimes of the social.

Anyhow, it's a magazine worth checking out. Poems by Catherine Barnett,
Brenda Coultas, Tonya Foster, Greta Goetz, Lisa Jarnot, Carol Mirakove,
Ange Mlinko, Cynthia Nelson, Hoa Nguyen, Alice Notley and Prageeta
Sharma are also included.

Contact Jordan if you're interested. The Hat is cool.

Marcella,

With this interest in space, you might like a book from a symposium a few
years ago. Thebook is
MAKING WORLDS: Gender, Metaphor, Materiality, ed. by Susan Hardy Aiken, Ann
Brigham, Sallie A. Marston, & Penny Waterstone, pub. by U of Arizona Press
in 1998. It is described as follows:
MAKING WORLDS brings together feminist activists, artists, and scholars to
address a series of questions that resonate with increasing urgency in our
global environment: How is space imagined, represented, arranged, and
distributed? What are the lived consequences of these configurations? And
how are these questions affected by gender and other socially constructed
categories of "difference" -- race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, nationality?

Not specifically about urban space, but includes that, and gives a
differently gendered approach than that of most authors in the list below.

Can't remember exact name, but had some great essays on particular urban
topics, especially in one issue called "Wild City." There was also a
feminist magazine (I'll try & look it up--scribbled it down somewhere) in
the 80s that has a super issue on women & urban spaces--really interesting
essay on woman who designed gardens in Washington DC, counterpoint to huge
pointy monuments...

CHARLES, PLEASE DON'T ERASE THIS! (joke)

        Why I Have Been So Virile & Insulting:

1).     I began these skirmishes more than 3 or 4 weeks ago in dinky
        annoyance at the unflaggingly petulant and oppositionalist
        (a)mentality that was then in vogue on this list (I'm sure never to
        return). This was the Pinsky/Howe-Stern=Gerontion thread,
        heightened then for me by MP's injection of Intolerance-etc.

2).     Devising an experiment, I did, with gestures bombastic, heighten my
        rhetoric daily, the purpose of which was to eventuate (yes I use it
        as a transitive verb) a call for Tolerance
        or Moderation or Open-ness (i say we hyphenate all double
        consonants) -- this in part having been effected.  My attempts
        to upset this list's petulant equilibrium were intensified in
        commentary to Perloff in brilliant contravocality to her
        insufferable advocacy for an increased intolerance in this
        company.  Said rhetoric has continued to heighten.

3).     I am now told many have left this list because of said racier
        intragroupal-insulting rhetoric, which is bearing some of the
        finest argumentative techniques we have (and bristling with them
        furthermore):  irony; satire, humor; atopical disquition, ad
        hominem, attribution of improper, foolish or otherwise ludicrously
        incongruous attributes of character and intellect (name-calling),
        and the use of a contemptuous tone and diction.  Most of which
        intentions have already been posted publicly. I would make a bomb.
        (joke).  Purpose?: Direct idiotic avant-garde pukery inward.  Mine
        was a moral and a merry war.

4).     My rhetoric was High, Frothy, & Exciting, yes.  Very blurtive &
        potent.  At times, devastating.  Perhaps I should have directed
        my attacks against the gestalt otherwise known as "The List";
        instead I chose to attack some of its core members, including the
        list owner. I thought this a more effective method to turn The List's
        knee-jerk scorn inward, and in many ways, it turns out, this does
        constitute a more "family-oriented" approach, keeping things
        personal.  I saw -- as an arriviste will -- the Hodgepodge of this
        list as a Hegemony curled up like a Hedgehog.  I needed to attack the
        Prominent Personalities curled in its underbelly, rather than all the
        barbs and spines on its dorsal side. Doing this (I am told)
        "outed" the uglier aspects of these personalities: someone
        suggested to me b-c just how closely all this parallels Wizard of
        Oz, in which our Dorothy (yours truly) crushes ruby-slippered
        critic with house-dropping rhetoric and goes on to waltz and pout
        her way to the unveiling of Wizard (cb) behind curtain (bad gender
        parallels in that sorry, but the anecdotal isn't necessarily
        apocryphal).  Since that time people ahve been asking me in helium
        voice, "Are you a good witch or a bad witch?" Be that as it may,
        please note:

5).     I took great pains to be bombastic and exaggerated -- not only to mock
        the earnest, but to underscore my purposes and keep Enemy guessing
        as to my intentions, but ALSO TO BE FUN, PEOPLE.  I tried to work
        in caricatures not with effigies: those of you who missed this,
        please take a vacation.

6).     My target was not Dignity but Vanity.

7).     THERE IS A GREAT DIGNITY TO THIS LIST.  It should be proud of itself; I
        am proud to be a part of it: you cannot know how much I appreciate
        Emily's post regarding Stein, how much I love to read these
        archives, how I enjoy the tiffs, what a great kick I get out of
        the PERSONALITIES of McGrand and Billy Little of Mairead Byrne and the
        poster formerly known as Henry Gould.  I respect the
        generations represented here: the long and noble "struggle" [ahem,
        MP] this list represents and I respect what its subscribers have
        given to American letters for, in some cases, 50 years.

8).     I felt compelled to attack LIST VANITY for sake of LIST BOINKY.

9).     If I however had known this forum was SO delicate, so brittle, so
        unlike kentucky fescue, so OVERLY serious and earnest in its own
        self-regard, I certainly would not have posted what I did FOR

        a. A cowboy does not ride upon a cat
        b. A pig does not gallop in a pot
        c. A man will not surf on a puddle

Once again, I thank you for your boinky.  I hereby lay down my cudgels.

But I reserve the right to use my ligneous atlatl every so often.

Be well and write however the fuck you want. -persona non gaga

PS, ONE LAST THING: I love Charles Bernstein, he continues to teach us a
great deal.  But it is a hard love.

In addition to the books/essays already mentioned, you should also (I would
say "first") look into the work of Raymond Williams, Henri Lefebvre,
Michel de Certeau, David Harvey, Lewis Mumford, Georg Simmel, Max Weber,
and Walter Benjamin.  Lefebvre's THE PRODUCTION OF SPACE is especially
important.  I have an essay on the early history of urban poetry in
English coming out in a collection to be published late next year from
University of Arizona Press; the book will probably be entitled The Nature
of Cities, and will feature essays on the relationships of literature to
urban environments.

Someone said here recently (was it Ron?) that a language poet was anyone
who had ever been publicly accused of being a language poet.  Thus I have
a favor to ask:  would someone please accuse me of being such?  Then I can
count myself among this illustrious group.

I'm not sure what a non-referential language would be. When Silliman
writes a line like "teaching Reagan to count backwards by eights" (I'm
quoting from memory probably inaccurately) does the word Reagan not refer*
to the former president? Same problem with non-signifying or
non-syntactical--this would be like saying a non-linguistic language.
Sure, we can reject a sort of facile "reference" theory of language that
people pretend to believe in while they are *accusing* people of being
language poets.

Hello.  This is my first post to this list.  I am woman, too.  In response to
the 3 quedstions about Arthur Sze's poem, I thought I might as well ask Arthur
what he would say about them (I didn't mention it was being discussed on this
list because,  if I understand this list's protocol, we're not supposed to
tell non-list members what's being discussed here?  Anyway, below is what
Arthur would say about the 3 questions.

Eileen

p.s.  C. Bernstein had suggested I join a couple of months ago.  How
interesting you all are (I mean that positively, not objectifyingly) -- none
of you are "gray."


------------------------------------------

> I am reading Arthur Sze--"Redshifting Web."  In that sequence he has
> these three lines:
>
> Instead of developing a navy, Ci Xi

>
> Does anyone know this story?  Who Ci Xi was?  How I might spell his name

>

1: Ci Xi is the pin-yin spelling, used throughout China now, of the late
Empress Dowager of the Ch'ing Dynasty. Instead of allocating her funds to
develop a navy to help counter threats from other countries, Ci Xi lavishly
spent a fortune to develop a two-story marble boat that could float on water.
The boat exists and is part of the Summer Palace in Beijing. In Chinese
culture, the boat is seen as a symbol of supreme lavishness and as an attempt
to avoid the pressure of reality.

> Question 2:
> In another part of the poem, he has this line: "as a lobster mold
> transforms a russula into a delicacy."  What is a "russula"?

2: A "russula" is the genus name for a series of mushrooms that have gills and
chalky white stalks. Some russulas are edible, others can cause severe stomach
upset. A lobster mold usually attacks a russula or lactarius mushroom; it
covers the mushroom and transforms it. The new lobster mushroom is not only
edible; it's an extraordinary delicacy. I'm thus using the lobster mushroom as
an example in nature where something can be transformed into something
astonishing.

> Question 3:
> I have figured out what a redshift is (more or less).  Does anyone know
> if there is such a thing as a redshifting web--astronomically,
> cosmologically, referentially to the universe outside the poem--, or is
> Sze writing to his poem?
>

3: In our understanding of the cosmos, it is now clear that, as Heraclitus
once
said, "everything is in motion." Galaxies that are traveling away from the
earth, which is of course also moving, send out sources of light that are bent
toward the red end of the spectrum. So, redshift is an image of the expanding
universe. I wanted to connect the infinitely large (cosmological redshift)
with
the infinitely small (a web), so I created the phrase "the redshifting web" as
the title to my book. It connects the very far to the very near. It's thus an
image of a poetics of an expanding cosmos, but also implies that the poet is
like a spider that creates webs with words.

Thanks for relaying this response.

Very best,

Arthur

I think Gabriel Gudding might have been the only one laughing at his own
*humor.* Insulting people is not inherently funny, nor is experimenting to
see how long it will take for others to lose their *tolerance* for such
insults. Just because you claim to be funny or ironic doesn't mean others
will take it in that spirit. It's like someone telling a joke and laughing
him/her self. Neither particularly moral nor merry. And please don't
accuse me of lacking sense of humor. I laughed so hard at story of
firecreacker in trombone valve that I gave myself an asthma attack.

     My thanks for the responses to the "french abstract lyric" question.
It's interesting, to me, to have a rather general term for a "form" be
defined so precisely, albeit with variance based on who's doing the
defining, in a (some) French poetic context(s), when I've only really run
across the term in question as an allusive gesture towards an unnamed
horde of young American poets. In one sense I was already aware of the
possibility of an abstract lyric via Celan, as Doug writes, where the
human impulse behind the poem remains transparent despite the
reconfiguring of the lyric form & literal content into something wholly
other.
But on the other hand it's somewhat sickening to realize that there's
another term in the air that anyone can use to corral a bunch of poets
into definition for the sake of furthering an argument or theory. There's
also something wrong with the designation of writing by Americans as
falling under the label of "French" & then that label being put forward
as demonstration of a problem in American poetics. I'm not looking to
assign blame in writing this, or to kickstart another boring polemic
dispute. It does seem to me sometimes, however, that much of what
qualifies these days as poetic discourse is overly dictated by the
freedom to assign labels to people, poems, forms, etc. & it's hard not to
do so often enough, when the topic of conversation is constantly reduced
to "what is Language poetry" or "what is New York School poetry" & placed
in terms of a, some, any opposition (or as if those questions are
actually crucial). Other than what they seem to mean for the purposes of
editing anthologies I tend to think of these things as largely
meaningless, mainly 'cause it seems that if I don't I won't see anything
very clearly. Oh well. Thanks in advance for bearing with.

There's no accounting for taste though, I thought the trombone story was

Jah Wobbble has just released a CD, "The Inspirations Of William Blake,"
that includes a reggae version of The Tyger.

Does anyone know of any other reggae versions of Blake? Romantic poetry?
Victorian?

I'm also reminded of a alternative version of "The Emperor of Ice Cream" I
heard once in New Orleans.  Unfortunately, I never learned who the group
was.

Jonathan Mayhew is a Language Poet (cap's and everything)...

So it's nice that he posted the short discussion of referential (not!)
language...citing the line about teaching Reagan to count backward.

I agree that it is very hard to claim non-referentiality for a work of
poetry, and not be dead wrong.  There is the very non-normative use of
words, but as in JM's example, and as in relatively non-linear writing
from the Cantos and Stein on down to most of what i see in the little mags
today, most non-normative writing has distinct thematic resonances.

There was a debate about this among several @lanta poets two nites
ago..one feels that "lack of aboutness" is one of the main faults in the
contemporary poetry he sees coming out now, when it doesn't quite work.
Others thought that that was not the main problem..

I would add that this poet has published some VERY non-linear, and
disjunctive work himself.  So while superficially his point sounded like
some of the critiques that've been articulated well here in the past, as
by H. Gould and Joe Safdie, he was really saying something different, not
just insisting on the communicative value of consevative form.

Anyway, i disagree:  most of the stuff i see coming out, if it fails to
have sufficient focus on a "theme" or "subject", that seems to have as
much to do with poor or unrealized writing, as with any intent to be
abstract or nonreferential...

A good example here might be Clark's The Little Door Slides Back.  This
book has been much praised and it has lots of fascinating stuff, and shows
flashes of exciting and brilliant writing.  But (this is tentative, as i'm
still in the process of going over it and clarifying what i think) much in
the book seems to overreach and to try to write in too many rapidly
shifting ways, and to accomplish too many ideational/narrative clusters,
with writing that's too unfocused, not sharp-edged, that's kind of mushy,
not sufficiently worked-over and alive to the ear.  These parts would
probably fall under my friend's critique as "lacking aboutness," but i
think the real problem is a need to tighten the writing.

Anyway that shouldn't be taken as a reasonable review of Clark, obviously:
that i hope to do later;  but a gesture at the book, which others might
look at to see what i think i'm saying...

This referentiality stuff is a
tricky bizness, sez i..

I was getting more and more excited reading someone's message about the
original materials that might be used for a "deep image" dissertation, and
with a system-freeze and a newly-installed AOL, I lost the message
permanently.  Would someone be generous and forgive this pedestrian plea and
forward the message to me?  Thanks, Aviva

of late reading, the following have been particularly interesting:

* _Arshile_ (#s  3,4,5, & 10)

* _Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry_, edited by the former Kent Johnson
and Stephen M. Ashby. U Mich, 1992

* _The Book of Insults, Ancient and Modern: An Amiable History of Insult,
Invective, Imprecation & Incivility (Literary, Political & Historical)
Hurled Through the Ages & Compiled as a Public Service by Nancy McPhee_
by Nancy McPhee, St. Martins, 1978.  A definite must for all Americans.

* _The Projectile Throwing Engines of The Ancients_, by Sir Ralph
Payne-Gallwey, a 1973 American reprint of a 1907 British version.  Great
drawings.

* _The STrange Lives of Familiar Insects_, Edwin Teale, 1964. Great
photos, spiff drawings, great insect melodrama told in breezy style.
Ever wonder how far the common housefly can travel in one day?  It's
all here.

* _Insect Stories_, Vernon L. Kellogg. Henry Holt, 1910.  A collection of
12 true tales about the miraculous doings of insects.

* _Little Lives: The Story of The World of INsects_., Julie Kenly. 1938.
A good, if somewhat romantic, look at some of the more famous insects
(eg, flies, cockroaches and bumblebees).

* _The Senses of Nonsense_, Alison Rieke, Iowa, 1992.  A clear and
down-to-earth study of nonsense in Joyce, Stevens, Stein, and Zukofsky.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Ive had posts that came thru late and garbled. I believe its a technical
problem, somewhere along the line, much as in the spring of this year when
there was a breakdown (major server)on the east coast. This showed as
difficulty sending or recieving email to or from europe.
Communications do occasionally break down.
Duh.

As to the editing, (feel free to correct me if I am mistaken) I believe that
this means to stay close to the subject, not introducing, say.....Plums! into
the subject matter, or remain relevant.
This is of course difficult to say the least..so many ..many subjects and
posters..it is almost impossible.My own opinion ? More rope, please. I want to
be in charge of my own hanging,
spectical and all. Anyone out there knit?

Mairead, please continue to raise your voice !! I dont always have time to
respond..though I want too....Time In very short supply here. If I did have the
time, I would try to say much as you have said..though I know I would not do it
half so well.My hat is off to you. You speak eloquently for many of us. Bless
the Irish!.. in us all....

Gabe. Hard post, Dude. You were coming across as emotionally dishonest. It just
simply doesnt work, especially from a poet.
That is the beauty of language. You can be as rude as you like. But be real.
When you are, your words shine...dont go stomping off either.As Henry..and
Kent, have done. there is nothing to be gained, and you would be sorely
missed.As they are.

We are all adults, and know when banter is working. We Know.And enjoy it, or
dont.
I like it myself. If something offends me, I function as my own editor. delete.

I was so pleased to see the support that Mairead received from the "guys" in
response to her post. Gender equality does indeed exist on this list. Thanks,
Guys...Your support is appreciated..and not lost in the roar of words.

Im new here. Every day. Not always time to post.Standard disclaimer for
misspelled words,
apologies for any stepped on toes.

QUERY:  Does anyone know of any list functioning as a sounding board for work
in progress?
Please backchannel me. All time and effort is appreciated, and I thank you in
advance.

I'm also reminded of a alternative version of "The Emperor of Ice Cream" I
heard once in New Orleans.  Unfortunately, I never learned who the group
was. <<<

Ken Nordine has a fabulous riff on "Emperor" on one of his recent
albums--I believe it's on /Devout Catalyst/, which has guest perf-poet Tom
Waits on one track and guest guitarist Jerry Garcia on several.

    Dear Poetics list--
    I will be in San Francisco (for a job interview) from Dec. 25th
    until early on the 30th, and am looking for a place to crash,
    a couch, a floor even. I will be clean. I will do your laundry
    or make icecubes or mow your lawn or whatever errands you may wish
    to devise for me (I will sing for my supper if you have a piano,
    and even be a brilliant conversationalist if you're into that sort
    of thing). I know it's unreasonable to expect that any single person
    (or couple or trio) would be able to put me up the whole time I'm
    there--but if I can get enough people to say that I wouldn't be
    too much of a pest on any single night, I could alternate---
    I am especially worried about where I would stay xmas night,
    being that there's no room at the inn, etc. If anybody has
    any room--or any leads on anybody who might--for any of these
    5 nights, I would deeply appreciate it. I will owe you one--
    I will let you stay at my place if you happen to be in NYC,
    and if I get the job I'm interviewing for, I will even offer
    you money somewhere down the line.....

       (i hope such requests are not inappropriate for the list--
        i--for one--would like to see more of these!)...
                sincerely, Chris Stroffolino

I believe it was "counting backwards by sevens," a standard part of the
mental status exam given in psych emergency wards every day (the
president for whom I was named could not pass this test). [Another
question on the list is to name the last six presidents of the US, but a
few years back the APA decided that the omission of Gerald Ford would
not count as an error since so few Americans seemed to know that he had
been president.]

I agree that there is no such thing as non-referentiality. It's a term
like non-narrative that is its own self-oxymoron. (The unfolding of
meaning in time, the only definition of narrative that makes any sense
to me, occurs even in the single letter poems of Joyce Holland's
"Alphabet Anthology." Every letter has a beginning, middle and end,
although Grenier is the only poet I know who seems to be able to
manipulate this effectively.)

On the use of the "=" in the name of the journal to which Wystan
referred, I've always presumed that it referred back to Saussure's
conception of difference as the governing principle of language (dont be
so sure, as CB would say). Tho I never did figure out the "/" in the
magazine M/E/A/N/I/N/G.

Has anyone noticed that what's happening in Congress right now isn't an
impeachment but a coup?

Joe, can you forward this to the list?  Thanks - Henry

Dear Poetics List,

Just to clarify:

1. I agree with everybody that list-hogging is bad for the list.

2. I was not consistently the high poster each month.  The few times I
was asked to slow down, I did.

3. I left the list not out of frustration but because the "review" status
I was put under led to unexplained censorship & hidden editing of the list.
I could not participate in that.  Could you?

4. The new diversity & plurality of postings to the list is great.  If I
can further that by remaining in exile, fine.  Remember, I recommended
these things - more people participating, more careful listening to
topics of messages - back in November, before anyone else.  I find that
hilarious.

5.  My last official post to the list was a poem about thanksgiving.
So happy holidays one & all.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?  Do you
believe in the Invisible Hand?  Better be good!

- Henry Gould

Responding having read some into the archive.

Am I one of Joel's "bailures"? Don't know. Appreciate the girl wagon that
has been somewhat acknowledged.

I had told Joel privately that I'd "BE BACK", just LIKE Arnold
Schwarzenegger w/ a review of Meow Press's '98 publication, Thrum by Noemie
Maxwell, which I read quickly, tenderly, and excitedly, a new writer for me,
a prose that gets the words to change their typical stance as noun or verb,
something that fascinates me as I think about what is narrative or not--
--but that I'll put in a future issue of Outlet, with 200 copies planned, I
don't know if my thoughts on this book would get more or less readership
there or  via this here channel.

!!!:
I must protest, and perhaps too much, that Mark, when he posted our "entire"
b/c "conversation" did not actually post its entirety, nonetheless I will
leave this quote from Eliza to stand in for my feelings on that subject

>>i must point out a delicious irony: as a woman,
>>am too often treated to persons overendowed with entitlement who feel it
>>is encumbent upon them to "explain" what i have said, speak FOR me, and
>>in so doing, completely ignore what in fact i HAVE said.
>--Eliza Mc Grand


And I , copying Juliana, am not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings -- tho
mine have been knocked about here --- and on third thought, "HURT SO GOOD",
gentlemen of the judiciary committee, think about the fact that it does seem
to be a climate that girls abandon, and maybe the climate's changing, and I
don't know how to act proper, I just know I need to spend my time on WRITING!!

set to nomail, set to bratty, Outlet 3 'll be out in March


happy hols, the gentlelady from California yields,,,,,

Subject:   The Written Poem: Semiotic Conventions From Old to Modern English

Huisman, Rosemary (University of Sydney); The Written Poem:  Semiotic
Conventions From Old to Modern English;Available from Cassell;Hb.: 0 304 33999
7; US$75.00/ 45.00

This book defines a focus of interest: contemporary poetry and its historical
construction as a 'seen object', and uses current literary and social theory
to facilitate its study.  Thus the book contains matter of relevance to
practising poets, to those engaged in literary studies and to those with a
sociolinguistic interest in the English language, especially in relation to
technical and social changes in language technology and literacy.
      Part One discusses the use of graphic, that is visual, conventions in
contemporary poetry in English.  How do we recognize 'a poem' (including
apparent contraventions, such as the 'prose-poem')?  Once a poem has been
recognized, what are the interpretative conventions brought into play for
reading it?  And especially, how has the spatial arrangement on the page
become 'meaningful' in its own right for much contemporary poetry?  The last
question, of the semiosis of the 'seen poem', is discussed at length, with
numerous examples from individual poems.  For a consistent descriptive
vocabulary for 'discourse' and 'genre', a model of language and social
context, derived from the work of the linguist M.A.K. Halliday and the
sociologist Basil Bernstein, where relevant, is explained and used.
     Part Two explores questions which have been brought to the fore in Part
One.  What is the origin of the line as the primary generic sign of poetry?
How does the potential for seen, rather than spoken, meaning emerge?  It
particularly focuses on changes in manuscript conventions from Old to Middle
English poetry, on the comparitvely late significance of print for poetic
discourse, on the change, in an increasingly literate understanding of
'literature', from a social to  a personal understanding of poetic meaning
from the late eighteenth century through the nineteenth century.  If what has
been regarded as an object, 'the poem', is an outcome of the social processes
of textual interpretation and production, so too is what has been regarded as
'the subject', that through which meaning is authorized.

I've heard a reggae version of The Tyger. Not sure if it was Jah Wobble,
but it was outstanding. My wife was listening to it on the radio and she
called for me to come in, knowing how much I love Blake. We just stood
transfixed in front of the receiver. It was a lovely moment I won't

I read Jordan Davis and Chris Edgar's first issue of The Hat this
morning, which I like for its focus and consistency of tone and
'spirit.' Two male editors publishing a first issue with only women is
quite notable and the results are not what I expected. (Hoa came into
my room last night with a stack in one hand of poetry submissions from
men and in the other ONLY one piece from a woman). So, I understand
building an issue of women's writing is no easy task. To find a
grouping of work that corresponds or echoes internally is difficult
enough. Restricting that to a particular, traditionally
under-represented gender, is moreso.

Lisa Jarnot's mix of high and low "tones" produces a lyric composition
that dips into the literal revelation of her experience--emotional,
cultural and intellectual. She writes:

In New Haven all the lights
go on across the sun, and for
millennia those who kiss fall into
hospitals, riding trains, wearing
black shoes, pursued by those
they love, the Chinese in the armies
with the shiny sound of Johnny Cash,
and in my plan to be myself
I became someone else with
soft lips and a secret life

The movement of phrases builds speed, injambing the lines to form a
poetic structure that "sounds" like a poem in the classic sense. That
is, her tone is elevated (as is the subject, I think) but the pieces,
the fragments of life drawn in, are personal, popular, or trivial:
mundane pieces elevated through the transmundane song of the poet.

In 'Moo is Om Backwards' Jarnot offers a similar song of heightened
musical sensitivity that works if you don't mind the repetition and
cuteness of its mooing cows and "daisies in the fields." Still, even
the repetition (increased to abstraction), roots itself in song. It is
a goofy song and I for one demand more goofiness from poetry! There is
an expressiveness here worthy of mention, especially in this cynical
domain.

Janice Lowe's poem 'The Summervilles of Pickens County' foregrounds
racial concerns in an intense way. Although her use of the little 'i'
is an annoying tick, she breaks the polite surface of the usual
composure and repression surrounding such issues. She writes:

i tell the black ones calling me red
     you wanna be red like me nigger
the white ones
     you redder than me you gotdam cracker
all this is turning me
into a kind of peckerwood nigger
i don't like for people to be black and greasy at the same time
i prefer yellow women for lovemaking some have said
all my children have lightskinned mothers
of course i'm a race man

Attention to coloquial speech ("gotdamn cracker") and an emotional
velocity that is specific to theme and location allows for the tension
of this poem to expand out beyond theoretical concerns of race into
actual perceptive rendering of the embodied word.

Kimberly Lyons short-lined poems attend to perceptions of event and
object, executed with the confidence of a poet: elegant, tight,
sonorous, commanding delight from those (like me) who find it hard to
give. Prone to 'realistic' perception rather than forced abstraction,
these poems radiate a lyric charm and sympathetic interior that makes
her voice vulnerable to charges of naivetee and empty chatter.

On the bar
last night I saw
Three martinis,
trembling triangles.
Nancy said
this is the first time
I've felt happy.
Big white trucks.
I guess everybody goes there
at least once.

Sutured
is that kind of medical
word.

August just whitens
things down into themselves.

It's not the paratactic stanza jumps that bother me, but the
occasional weight one word is forced to carry, words simply not worthy
of the emotional depth conveyed in her phrasing. Still, 'overall,' a
fine, (and by far the largest grouping here--20 pages), selection of
poems.

Juliana Spahr closes The Hat with a single poem called 'Poem.' It
addresses the yankee anxieties of the pronoun (the List covered this
territory some weeks ago) in a direct, syllogistic address from
"Albany or maybe Honolulu."

One fine day one woke up and found one's self gone.
But one didn't leave the boys behind.
One didn't leave the girls behind.
One didn't end nothing or it.
So one called out: mix with [generic pronound deleted]; mess with
[generic pronound deleted].
Or I or he or she am or is trying
missing or mixing things up.
Thanks for the directions.

This self-proclaimed "love poem" might be void of lutes and forlorn
troubadors, but it is a kind of offering of the self, however guarded
by the playfulness of syntactic play. This sophisticated piece plays
with the implied meanings and reverberations of syntax and word-choice
native to Spahr's socio/cultural concerns. But you'll have to read it
for yourself to see the playful layers she weaves.

There are many other pieces worthy of mention but I am exhausted as
are you, dear reader, I'm sure. So check out The Hat. Its editors have
made something that is new to me, revealing an aspect of women's
writings overlooked b

no, Jacques, no!   if we didn't receive our own posts then I'm afraid (very,
very) that would cause the list to implode.  I think that the satisfaction of
getting your own post back IN A FEW MINUTES helps  compensate for the weeks or
months of waiting to hear back from editors.  with the list we can create a
baby and see it born instantly- Guaranteed!  (well, given recent history,
almost guaranteed).  in the welcome message we are urged to consider the list
a form of PUBLICATION more than communication.  not only that but we are
ARCHIVED!  Whew!  heady stuff.
I considered sending this backchannel, but...

dale, hoa, & other editors:

thanks for the description of The Hat. You mention that Jordan and Chris
(two boys) haved edited an issue of a magazine with all women poets. Why
is this a surprise? While it may be unusual, I think it is only as one
famously male's male's male would say, "apropos." Women, generally, are
doing much more interesting writing these days, and have been since the
70s. Not that there aren't useful boy-originated poets, but in my
opinion, these last few decades have been really marked by this
tendency. Representation of women by male editors is another issue, and
leads people, for instance, to say that 'language poetry is male
dominated,' when in fact if you look at the writing this isn't true. As
far as all-women issues of magazines, whether edited by men or women:
Are you suggesting that using some fairly restrictive criteria of
editing that one would end up with anything but the same? Is it
something that has to be set aside, like "this is our mission" or "no
boys allowed" etc.?

this came up at the now historic New Coast conference in buffalo back in
93. When discussing this issue, the over representation of men by men in
presses and magazines, one editor said that the problem was really that
women didn't send in their work, while men are quick to submit work for
consideration. Some people have said (sorry for lack of specifics, I
don't mean to sound like Henry Hyde) that there aren't as many women
writers so they get published much easier, become more sought after and
therefore, somehow (and I find this one hilarious) more difficult to get
to send work to mags and presses. The implication being here that women
have more choices and that there is a "shortage" of women's
writing...when in fact this simply couldn't be further from the truth.

In my experience as an editor, you can't wait for the writing you want
to publish. So, with a few exceptions, unsolicited writings are
generally male and generally not what I'm looking for. Dale, your
description of Hoa's showing you the pilo submissions by men and the
lone submission by a woman further strengthens what i like to call the
"receptical theory of editing"--if you provide a trash can, it is likely
to filled up. Which isn't to say that unsolicited work can't have a
place in the development of a literary community, or a publishing
sequence, whether a periodical or chapbook series. I'm only trying to
say that such methods are limited.

I used to think that the gender-limit on such editing projects was
problematic. As a form of editing, like my fantasy of a moderated
listserv (which, if I get my way, will become a reality) such
limit-oriented projects have their place. This was originally the focus
of Chain and there are many projects out there that tend to focus on
women's writers. I've stated that this doesn't need to be arbitrary, but
it often is. I now kind of like that arbitrary restriction, and have
toyed with that in planning future series of the meow press chapbooks.
We all have these restrictions anyways, so why not extend them to fit a
whole class of people: like white boys, or just boys in general. Where
maybe once I would be offended by such editorial specificity, now such
CENSORSHIP excites me, and I mean that honestly, sincerely (in case that
was ever in question). Because I don't feel that it is censorship, but
rather an editor's perogative.

Anyhow, all that aside, I am currently reading manuscripts for books
scheduled to be published next summer -- and while for me there are a
few interesting male-dominated writers out there, I would like to invite
the women on the poetics list to send either manuscripts or proposals
for manuscripts (of poetry, prose, or for monograph critical pamphlets)

i wanted to respond to myself in public and suggest that i didnt mean
that i was going to use the women-only restriction for the editing of
meow press. while that is certainly an emphasis (especially during my
current reading), that more has to do with the writers i like being
women for the most part, and i am currently actively in contract talks
with some very interesting writers who happen to be women. so my plea to
poetics for submissions is an invitation, not the focus of my research.

as far as "arbitrary" restrictions, I don't mean to suggest that such
projects as Chain or Outlet are anything resembling arbitrary. I do mean
to suggest that I may use such an arbitrary restriction in the future,
as has been described on this list: only poets with relatives in
Michigan, etc...

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

i've just emerged from a long, often frustrating week of posting folks
backchannel re the recent (and apparently ongoing) list controversy...
please, don't *any* of you feel you're being singled-out here... if you've
heard from me backchannel, *any of you*, it's probably fair to say that you
can multiply whatever you've heard from me by 10 or 20 anyway, and that
this gives some idea of the amount of backchannel conversation i've been
having... perhaps you've been in the same boat as me... whatever the case,
i will risk, again, a bit of overweening sincerity in trying to convey what
i've learned...

i think it's fair to say that, as these backchannel conversations have
proceeded (and in some cases, escalated), my thinking and writing has at
times been tortured, gnarled (as i will no doubt give evidence of
*here*)... i suppose this is b/c i've been at some pains in trying to
present something like the whole *me*---which, in my view, impinges upon my
full(er) understanding and articulation of the more conflicted aspects of
the recent ruckus... i.e., mixed feelings and motivations i might have, why
i might have them, how my more personal relationships with some of you
influence my judgment, trying to account for my relationships, trying to be
objective *and* considerate---an apologia at times, at other times simply a
(self-)confrontation... i've been told, by some, that they are in complete
accord with what i'm saying... i've been told, by others, that we remain
worlds apart, and that in fact my motivations as a mediator (if you will)
have been murky, impure, compromised in ways that i seem unable or
unwilling to grasp...

in addition to some troubled sleep patterns, i've emerged from the last
week, all told, with the same conclusion about these spaces that i came to
some six years ago:  that it would be wrong to take what is said here, on
the list (or even in one-on-one communique)---however well-intended,
however mean-spirited, however apparently moderate---as the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth...

((and yes---i mean to imply that this all, for me, resonates with the
ongoing judicial "hearings," which have rapidly devolved imho into an
attempt to railroad clinton out of office, as some of you have suggested...
a reality, imnsho, far more pressing than what goes on on this list))...

the reason why i observe (allege?) that the truth (as above) is not to be
had quickly, or completely, or without reservation:  we are more than the
sum total of our words,  and esp., our words in these regions... i don't
believe for a moment that one can obtain some unmediated, disembodied
truth, and i certainly don't believe one can obtain same simply by virtue
of *this* sort of exchange... if i *did* believe this, kass and i might
have decided upon marriage online, so to speak... albeit there turned out,
in our case, to have been much truth exchanged in our months of courting
(as it were) online---in addition, i should say, to certain miscues (i am
potentially much mouthier and obnoxious f2f, as any who know me well can
bear witness to)---there was additional truth to be gotten from spending
time with each other... and of course there has been more truth exchanged
since we began living together, a process that will (i hope!) continue as
time passes...

to me it is in fact the assumption of something remaining to be understood
that provides me with a tentative, provisional, but nonetheless necessary
grasp of something called "truth"---and leads me, i would like to think, to
some operating conception of what is just, and fair... as, i would trust
(but which may not be the case), such an assumption might lead each of
you...

i find as a result of my transactions, then, that it's necessary not to
leap to judgment, that it's necessary to try to give everyone the benefit
of the doubt... were we dealing with what appeared, more clearly, more
certainly, to be (e.g.) neo-nazi behavior, i might not advocate such care,
such thoughtfulness...

((and here again:  one of the problems with the recent impeachment
hearings, imnsho, is that the republicans, in treating the current articles
of impeachment as having the same gravity as the watergate articles, are
insidiously citing watergate-inspired words in justifying their actions))...

((well even here, you can see how one can get oneself into all sorts of
trouble---i would seem to be aligning those who are against me (against
charles, to cut to the quick) with the republicans... i.e., with
conservative, right-wing thinking (apologies to you republicans out
there)... nothing could be further from what i intend---and in any case,
and as i've said to some of you backchannel, the left has always proved
itself expert at tearing itself apart... nevertheless there is, i think, a
certain positive and instructive correlation here with the flawed logic of
the republicans---which of course is a politically *motivated* logic, in
their case... though not so in the case of those who consider themselves,
sadly, my ethical "adversaries" in the recent poetics brouhaha... clearly i
believe the impeachment hearings crucial enough to risk confusing with the
controversies of this list... just as clearly, i believe it to be a great
mistake to assign to anyone *here* a strictly insidious intention, such as
"censorship," thence to argue strictly on the basis of such an
assignation---which is what, i respectfully submit, i believe my most
adversarial "adversaries" have done... and of course they believe me in
this regard to be part & parcel of the general 'corruption,' ETC.))...

let me not lose my own point in the muddle of this post:  i think
listening, and listening generously, brings certain rewards over time... i
am not calling for more "moderate" (adj.) posts---we can rock & roll, sure,
of course... self-moderation, as i understand it, simply means that,
whatever one is about, one listens (to oneself, among others) in
contributing to whatever this list is, and is in the state of becoming...
how else can one envision this list actually working as such?... i must
admit to being at somewhat of a loss if what i'm saying here seems
idiosyncratic in its appeal to putting a bit of (a bit of) faith in our
capacity for creating a vital communal (and certainly not homogeneous)
gathering, one predicated on goodwill...

anyway, i hope what i've said here makes some small amount of sense, and
will prove modestly useful as we continue together, and apart, in such
uncertain times...

best,

Perhaps you are thinking of  J. H. Fabre, author of "The Life of the Fly",
and discoverer of larval dimorphism.  He and his family, having joined the
first and last member of a line of processionary moth caterpillars,  took
it in shifts once to observe  them marching  round and round the edge of a
barrel for an entire day until the circle broke up  in exhaustion.

jacques debrot asks of dipalma's involvement in the naming of L=A=...

i understand that charles bernstein bounced the name Language (no equal
signs) off of steve mccaffery, and steve suggested "Pegatext(e)" as an
alternative.

assuming that aldon nielsen and ron silliman are both correct -- that the
equal signs served both to distinguish this project from the linguistics
journal and to emphasize the differential nature of the saussurean
signifier -- one wonders what would have been the comportment of a
burgeoning (so-called, or even post-) "P=E=G=A=T=E=X=T=(E) poetry"!

Tom--Clinton's quote yesterday comes from the Edward Fitzgerald's
Rubaiyat, and I too thought about in relation to our erasure thread,
although the emphasis in this case is really on the *impossibility* of
erasure:  with the passage of time itself troped as a kind of writing.
Here's the passage in full:

The Moving Finger writes: and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
  Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.

do you suppose the bill bought ms. monica a copy of rubyat as well?

how odd.  poetry used to be written to court, has become one of those trite

on the other, begin regurgitating hairballs at the thought of all those

if you were going to court a beloved, what poetry book would you buy
him/her?

my vote for today: if i was flush for money and time, might get oxford

Anyway. Something like that.

I'm very grateful that noone has felt outraged to have never
received the Phillytalks newsletter, or to have received it only
sporadically. Not only is PT a moderated forum, small as it is; it is
also "censured," and thwarted, and edited, daily, and in the very
love-labor of its production, by such factors as costs of mailing and
distribution, reproduction of the page as material surface of
inscription, curation, editing, proofing, etc. And in none of these
aspects is it unique.

anselm writes of how a formal description (altho arguably "abstract"
suggests to me something of content as well) of french verse is / can be
applied, largely exclusively, to current american poetics, and further
suggests that this is done as something of a convenient labelling of (or
"coralling") such work, "that much of what qualifies these days as poetic
discourse is overly dictated by the freedom to assign labels to people,
poems, forms, etc.", and that such labels are ultimately pretty
meaningless.

i agree with these sentiments and suggest an approach to labelling as an
heuristic, as a way of furthering investigation within a milieu or frame
of reference -- a frame which should, in the last instance (and with
apologies for the heideggerian-derridianism), be held under erasure.

as i suggested earlier, i take "abstract french lyric" to refer to the
work of albiach, royet-journoud, et al.  but who is meant when this is
applied to current american work?  i certainly don't have an exhaustive
list, but for me, i can take, as example, two to whom this label might
apply: gale nelson, claire needell.

how might this label apply to these two writers?  well, there's a
sparseness to their work, a kind of evacuation, an "abstraction" from
(pulling away from, removal from), for lack of a better term, poetic
reference.  "shall we avoid analogy?", the french dictum asks, and the
practical answer leaves the barest of referents both semantically *and*
visually on the page.

now why apply this label, aside from the obvious answer that it seems an
appropriate albeit very general level of descriptive poetics.  well for
me, it's an heuristic, it gets me going in a direction, it situates the
writing within a milieu, so if someone were to ask me what the work of
gale nelson or claire needell is like, i might be able to give her some
sense of how i read them by referring to an "abstract lyric like that of
albiach or royet-journoud."

however, beyond the general descriptive level, there is also a more
material level at which this milieu can be seen to work.  nelson and
needell are both published by burning deck, which publishes english
translations of much "abstract french lyric poetry" and is owned and
operated by the waldrops who themselves translate much of this work for
other presses like awede, post-apollo, etc.

now obviously delimiting such a milieu can only get us so far: nelson and
needell do work that can't be contained within these descriptive and
material levels; burning deck publishes work that similarly cannot be
contained.  i could further complicate things by adding another writer to
the two already mentioned, namely barbara guest, whom i think, from fair
realism to defensive rapture and finally quill solitary apparition, moves
progressively into a more evacuated poetics  -- reinforced materially by
the fact that while the first of the two above-mentioned books are from
sun and moon, the third is from post-apollo (albiach's most recent english
publisher); and perhaps undermined materially by the bulk of guest's prior
work in the manner of the "new york school".

the danger in labels, i think, comes when they are used less for heuristic
purposes and more for value judgments.  i think the "abstract french
lyric" tag, applied to current american work, can be and is used (as
anselm suggests) in a belittling or pejorative sense.

now in another context, mark prejsnar writes:
        most of the stuff i see coming out, if it fails to have
        sufficient focus on a "theme" or "subject", that seems to have as
        much to do with poor or unrealized writing, as with any intent to
        be abstract or nonreferential...

let me say i admit the gist of what mark is saying here: there is a real
danger to simply taking up uncritically what albiach or any other writer
does. i dont agree that "un-poor" or "realized" writing must demonstrate a
"sufficient focus" on theme or subject.  but this is a whole other matter.

my problem is this: i can delimit a milieu of abstract french lyric
tendancies in current american poetics, one which i think can be
resonably and objectively challenged, and which can only get you so far
until you start dealing in specifics; but i wonder how to delimit "poor or
unrealized writing"... whether it's "abstract" and "french" or, to take
mark's example, jeff clark.

and i mean this as a sincere question -- my jury, like mark's i think, is
still out on clark's book.  and tho i like mark's description of why the
clark book does not work for him, i don't wish to take up that book again
cuz i posted on it some months ago and have not revisited it since.  i'd
rather work it from this abstract french lyric angle, and pose the
question this way:

how does one decide when a current american abstract french lyric is
"successful" and when it is not, when it is simply abstract or
nonreferential for abstraction's and nonreferentiality's sakes?

(i'll hint at my initial answer: i don't think we have sufficiently
developed criteria for this yet beyond the "gut level"...)

(the same question applies, for me, to so-called post-language poetries as
well, provided you pick terms other than "abstract" and "nonreferential"
for your scope...)

thanks and bests,

There is some weird tech glitch in the Listserv system because my
original post of the Hat review was sent by me to the List on Dec 4,
only to reach the List on Dec 12? In the interim, I rewrote the post and
sent it on the 7th. That one didn't go public until the 10th. Another
post on the same subject went immediately from my machine to the list on
the 9th. Hopefully this will explain some of the repetition.

Joel, I am surprised two male editors produced an issue of women's
writing. Aren't you? I don't see that every day. And what prompted the
reviews I wrote was the writing within, which is exciting, and provides
a rich contrast to the recent Moving Borders Anthology, which to me is
limited in its presentation of women's writing. (How do you determine
value, by the way, in a poem? How do you navigate (moderate?) your
editorial decisions?)

In addition to using your "receptical theory of editing" (which I value
because of the strange, long-shots that arrive out of nowhere), we
solicit a good amount of work. And even when we solicit work from women
we rarely receive as much as we had hoped. Although I don't share your
egalitarian heart, I'm hip enough to read the conflicting and
contradictory motivations and struggles for and against participation in
a scene that desires experiemental art for political and social
transformation. On one hand, sheer numbers strengthen the political
movements, but at the loss of qualitative production. That quality, like
value, varies for all of us, I think. And how our values (aesthetic
and/or politic) are exchanged on the poetic market reveals the limits of
our toleration. What Marjorie Perloff brought up some weeks ago is key
to this. One can be tolerant of cultural struggles and intolerant of
aesthetic practices that are used by some members of cultural groups to
whom one is sympathetic.

Anyhow, this concerns represenations of the social, which I am
interested in because, as an editor, these conflicts proliferate around
me. Poetry has much wider concerns and its reality is limited by
discourse in social environments.

At Bowling Green State, either fall of 74 or winter of 75, i took a class
taught by ray dipalma that covered works by andrews, coolidge, silliman, &
dipalma. dont remember what the name of the course was, but the term
'language poetry' definitely came up in that class.

Joel, I didn't mean to suggest that you or anyone else is packing pages
of journals, chapbooks, books etc just for the sake of diversity, as if
no selection, or qualitative decisions were being made. I think
aesthetic decisions are being made all the time, decisions that are
shaped by the dominant voices of the "avant-garde." What is your
selection/solicitation process? How do you manage experimental product
while living up to your own self-generated demands of art &
cultural/political transformation?

For me the issues consist of: aesthetics--is this a poetics you respect;
quality--how does an individual piece, even if it represents an
aesthetic position you identify with, stand up to your own singular
demands, and if it doesn't, what validates its inclusion in your
journal; human diversity--does my journal reflect a range of human
variety; impact--how will these pieces stand up in the cultural market,
what will they represent of my process and spirit. More importantly, to
what level, if any, have I produced a work of active dissent focused
many places at once. I'm not interested in a journal's reception so much
as its circulation of thought and emotion. Part of this is an active
process. I am seeking all the time. The process is also passive; work
falls out of the aether to challenge and confront my own good opinions.

I get confused when discussing the way certain groups are represented,
because it's not my position to represent, but to reveal, in any way,
the very complex diversity of human composition through the agency of
poetic expression. I am dedicated to women's writing, but I don't make
it my crusade; it's not a banner by which I wish to gain acceptence or
approval from anyone.

I'm a little behind in catching up with the Poetics List, & this may
already have been responded to, but the "academy of the future" line is
from the title poem in _Rivers & Mountains_.  I'm pretty sure that
"feminine, marvelous & tough" is not from any FOH poem; the line appears
in _The Sonnets_ by Ted Berrigan, & may appear in other poems by
Berrigan as well.

As to the Carroll, you got it right, and the reference--what he's sending
up--is one of the genres derived by romantics from the Childe Ballads (La
Belle Dame Sans Merci is an examole of an allied genre--all are a sort of
folksy medievalism): the epic hero ballad. Apparent here in the metrics,
and confirmed as such later in the poem.
The Ball derives I think from subSaharan linguistic forms, but it speaks
less to me.
Years ago I heard Linda Parker read her "non-referential" poems and was
profoundly moved. They seemed to me to be at the edge of having explicit
content, although there were no recognizable words. Either my reaction was
physiologically conditioned--that certain sound combinations produce
certain reactions--or there was a referentiality in the sounds themselves.
It would be interesting to tease out the referentiality if that's what it
was, but I haven't done so.

Well, for starters, "brillig" refers to a time of day (approximately 4
pm) and "slithy toves" refers to toves that are both slippery and lithe.

I find this to be an interesting, yet odd problem. At Lipstick Eleven,
we receive numerous submissions from women. But don't forget, you can
always solicit work if you're having problems with "representation" in
your mix of writers. Publish women and more women will follow.

I don't think so. 'Brillig' in fact is simply filling certain slots
[metrical, syntactic, narrative, etc.] in a linguistic structure, a
machine, or if you want a poem.

Maybe those of us who have a vague sense of the history of the language can
detect a Germanic suffix in the sequence '-ig' at the end of 'brillig'.
With that in mind, as well as the phonic association with 'brilliant' and
maybe even memories of Old French, we still wouldn't know that this is a
word in English except for its position after 'twas'. The point, I think,
is that we could put ANYTHING in this slot, and as long as it satisfies all
the relevant metrical, syntactic, and narrative requirements, it would
WORK. That is, it would mean "a time of day (approximately 4 pm)", or
something similar.

The same applies to 'slithy' and 'tove' and in fact to all of the other
so-called reference words in the poem.

Speak of erasure. Carroll has erased all reference here, leaving only the
function words that have value only within a given linguistic system. We
recognize the '-s' at the end of 'toves' as a plural marker. It is a very
familiar morpheme in English, of course. But it has no reference to
anything outside of the universe of the English language. Neither does
'twas'.

As Mark Weiss suggests, it WOULD be interesting to tease out the so-called
referentiality here, if that is that it is.

It seems that more than nouns and adjectives are referential.  "did" refers to
a sense of curiousity or a statement that something has happened.  "all"
refers to inclusivity.    "were" refers to the past.   and so on.
so it seems to me that this poem still is referential even if the lexical
words are as George says.
And maybe the question should be REFERENTIAL FOR WHOM?   If Leonard says that
"brillig" refers to 4pm for him, then I guess it does, though it apparently
does not for George.

Re:syllables/sounds that refer: "The Red Pencil"'s an obnoxious little
daily column squeezed onto *The Washington Post*'s Comics page, written
by "wrytor@aol.com."  A month back or so, "wrytor" laid down the line on
the sounds of words & what they trigger.  The sounds in "melody," it was
written, make more people "smile" than the sounds in "thatched" (there
was no evidence of a survey, of course).  "Wrytor" went on to suggest
that it would "behoove poets" to choose words with sounds that "people
like" when crafting their poems.  Most "atch" words were on the
short-lived list I kept of words I liked for their sounds.  "Melody"
certainly was not, & "lily melody" sure made me grunt when a friend ran
my name through an anagram program.

Separately: a linguist I know is currently working on a book about
nonsense words "in English."  His not-so-ambitious thesis is that
nonsense words written by English writers don't (or rarely do) contain
sounds that aren't already "acceptable" or "recognizable" to the English
reader/speaker.  And that we tend to make "bad-guy" aliens, if they're
speaking a language (written by an English speaker), which translates to
"if they're speaking nonsense," sound vaguely like speakers of languages
from whatever country "we're" ("nation-wide") most afraid of or pissed
at when the language/nonsense is created.  Germans, Russians, etc.; he's
got all the proof needed there.  The "sounds already acceptable" applies
to the Carroll; as another lister (which?) pointed out, that makes "The
Jabberwocky" at *least* refer to the English language.  And it was
written for English readers.  I'm curious as to whether Carroll's poem
(surely the book it appears in must've been) has been translated into
another written/spoken language: anyone know?  I'm curious as to how
nonsense words are represented in signed languages.  Simply spelled out
in the letters of the signer's country?  Are there any "nonsense words"
peculiar to signed languages?  Anyone know?

Yet another lister (forgive me, I'm stil learning this new e-mail acct &
can't retrieve the msg while composing) wrote "My wife's name is
Tove...Did someone say slippery"?  Did someone on the list?  If so, I
missed it.  Carroll said *slithy*.  As much as I hate to admit anything
to "wrytor," it seems as if sounds & syllables *do* refer, if only
because readers are tempted to *make* them refer.  The Bernstein quote
that started off the whole non-referentiality hubbub makes *more* sense
in this context: "the reader's misplaced urge to 'make sense' of
poetry."  Replace "poetry" with "nonsense."

I know I've always gotten a swampy, slippery feeling from that first
stanza of "Jabberwocky," even when I became aware that it was intended
as a send-up.  I've also always "felt" that the nouns "refer" to
creatures/animals: mome raths, toves, borogoves...not inanimate objects,
I suppose, because of the verbs, the "fact" that the nouns are verbing.
Yet "outgrabe" could easily be read as an adj., say "All  pink were the
borogoves, and the mome raths grey."  Yet I've never read it that way,
never "felt" it that way.  I'm in no way prepared to agree with "wrytor"
that the sounds of words are "pleasant" or "unpleasant" in & of
themselves.  If more people like the sounds in "melody" than in
"thatched," I'd call that a response to what the words, not the
syllables, refer to.  Or at least, I would very much *want* to.  Yet the
sounds in "The Jabberwocky" combine in such a way as to give me an
overall sense of "swampiness," and I'd be interested to find out if
others out there have "felt" this "sense," or another sense--say, an
urban one.  Or "felt" no "sense" at all--felt the words entirely
non-referential.  It pisses me off that I'm not capable of "not getting
a feeling" about the sense of those words & syllables, that I'm a
captive of referrals, that "slithy" might make me hear "slippery" and
"slimy" and think "slithy" a *stronger* "English word" for making me
feel both those two words and something else--say the excitement, or say
the nausea, of an unrecognizable word...

In disagreement with Emily, I'm convinced that there are naturally-
pleasant sounds.  There is research, I'm fairly sure, to corraborate
this, but I'm going by experience and vague memory of a lot of reading
in or near the subject.  I think the "euphony" of "ah," "oh" and
"ooo" is widely-recognized and follows from these sounds being baby-
sounds, and unbelligerant; "aah," "ih," "eh" and similar sounds are
normally associated in nature with threatening sounds, or sick sounds.
Compare a baby's cooing with adult rage or the sound of someone barfing.
Similarly with consonants: sibilants sound "nicer" than harsher sounds
(the name of which escapes me)--because harsher sounds are more usually
part of growls, etc.  Also, "nice" sounds are generally, perhaps always,
easier to say than harsh ones.

For the same reason, I contend that there are naturally harmonic chords,
though this gets into the structure of the human auditory system.
Primary colors, too, are naturally more appealing than secondary colors.

So, the argument comes back, why do I prefer lime green to blue.
Because we mature out of simple, natural "good taste," especially
those of us who are artists, or aesthetically-sensitive.  Too much of
a good thing equals boredom, so we come to like discord as a hedge
against boredom.  There are all kinds of further complications I don't
have time to get into.  Just wanted to throw out the cocktail-party-
level preliminaries.

For what it's worth, I wasn't just gyring and gimbling. If memory serves,

But do sibilants sound nicer to speakers of all, or even most,
languages?  The German "Ich" sounds a bit like someone gagging, but its
"Gott" sounds firm and strong compared to "Dieu"'s 'boneless string of
vowels.'  French is so smooth that (oh forgive me, French posters) it
can sound like someone murmuring English in her sleep.  A British friend
tells me that after a year in Russia, English sounds choppy, clumsy,
disjunct.  Nice sounds are easier to say than harsh ones for whom?
Those whose languages do not include many harsh ones...(?)

>>For the same reason, I contend that there are naturally harmonic
chords, though this gets into the structure of the human auditory
system.<<  Oh, Bob, we *do* disagree!  Play nothing but atonal music for
a month or so and it sounds "correct" in the body; my old electronic
music prof actually felt (at least, I believed it when I saw it)
physical pain if one played a C-major chord on the piano.  I've felt a
bit queasy on hearing them after lengthy forays into non-harmonic
listening.  I'd hate to chalk up my preference for such music to my
"good taste," to having become bored with more "natural" chords...I
chalk it first to (assigned) immersion, and not-too-long after that, a
feeling/conviction that *it* was what was "natural" (read: sounded good)
to me now.  Did I need to be immersed in harmonic music before it felt
"right" to my body?  I have no idea; I was immersed in it before I was
born, and while a cooing baby...one more question for the wild boy of
Aveyron...

I'm glad for your good arguments for disagreement, though; I even agree
with some of 'em.  No question that I'd rather hear a cooing baby than a
puking adult.  But what if adorable babies sounded like puking adults,
and puking adults sounded like cooing babies?  At any rate, it's all
tangled up in referentiality & nature vs. nurture & heavenly labia,
oops, -ls, in a world of gutturals.  And whatever the oops purports, I'm
one of those who thinks "it's" a choice...

best, em

I want to second J's response here and once more sugest to those that
haven't to GET (now!) Margy Sloan's MOVING BORDERS anthology: 3 decades
of innovative writing by women.  As I continue to read through it I am
moved by the language of the poets here--from the amazing Neidecker
piece to Diane Ward to Cole Swenson to Waldrop to....the end of the
alphabet.

Oh list,

A few day ago, as days do, a Mr. charles bernstein posted a rather long
mentioning of various things. I was rather, then rather empty that day.

So to eleviate things or other things I took some of his words and hid
them.    I kept the others that seemed to fit together best in
the following badly fitting inter-textual poem:
I don't have a title: can they suggest or is that a throat problem.



(possibly: a title?) (Oh, and this is just part one, enjoy as enjoy
goes)


This is untrue,

the subscriber  going numerous
past,   the end  while the two or one were  twice  detailing
correspondence.

But I haven't, because I considered
at a certain    point.      You realize matter into something
ideological  a disservice=20,     indeed serious=92,    accusation=
might.

Even such a formidable  as      the     end
would be not clairvoyant. The more
obvious conclusion      might have=asked to observe
as four consolidating.

Their posts realize  a second else.

Unambiguously manifest  she or he    no intention
abiding by the basic.    Decisively.       You are wrong.

Gabriel Gudding's status has never been.
And his ability     directly is the same as anyone
reading would aware.

There was the assumption.       Considerable and providing
are guilty of something       and,  er,                 know to find ways.

I realize those and most  do something=again.
They spoke of the list being tone,      tended or scolding and  ignored.

Hectoring tones described to me, over and again,
the space  for one thing.             I was committed
Having the list be=even the tiniest amount. Intervention,
the most unassailable grounds, and compliance, the stated firestorm

The fact is -- I realize.

I didn't mean to suggest that all language is referential (in my post that
helped get this thread going), just that this wasn't a useful
discriminator for L=a=n=g poetry (e.g. all language poetry is
non-referential).  Yvor Winters wrote about psuedo-reference apropos of
certain lines of Eliot and other modern poets.  In other words, you can
refer to something that doesn't exist and for which there is no context
for the reader to identify. L. Carroll was doing something similar--by
syntax "brillig" has to refer to a time of day or season of the year,
etc.. In some sense the reader* wants*  this to be referential, even in
absence of specifiable referent. Blue psuede-shoe-referentiality.

Where can I get a copy of The Hat? I have deleted original announcement if
there was one. Also, in  my misremembering of teaching Reagan to count
backwards by sevens I had substituted 8, associating this number with his
two presidential terms (8 years)--another sort of pseudo-reference
perhaps. Also I remember an essay by G. Davenport on Olson's
Kingfisher--to the effect that several individuals who had recommended him
the poem in the strongest possible terms had no idea what it was about
referentially--for example no one could tell him who "Fernand" was.

Back to you briefly, Emily:

I would guess that sibilants (and "silibants" wasn't a typo, but I
saw it was wrong as soon as I saw myself quoted, so I guess there's
hope for me) initially sound nicer to all human beings, and maybe even
mammals.  But language is hugely complex, and expressiveness much more
important than euphony.  My bottom-line point, strongly on nature's side
versus nurture, is that we start in all sensory modalities with simple
near-universal likes, and grow away from them into various levels of
complexity.  Gustatory likes seem this way, though influenced by each
person's physiology.  In music I suspect all humans initially prefer
chords whose component notes are in a simply harmonic relation to each
other.  Maybe the ratios would vary from one culture to another, but
not the fact of simple ratios.  I'll bet that truly atonal music is
an acquired taste in all cultures.  I'm sure repetition is the basis of
pleasure--and of boredom; so some but not too much repetition is best.
A note an octave above another would initially seem most pleasurable to
a baby, I believe, once the baby has become bored with the second note's
repetition.

Nice sounds are easier to say than harsh ones for whom?  For everyone.
I'm just referring to how much one has to open one's mouth and shape it,
etc., to say a sound; by this criterion, vowels are more pleasant than
consonants--except for a cat's purr, of course.  Sibilants are easier
to say than--still can't recall the word.

Metric verse is initially more pleasurable than non-metric, all else
kept equal.  But there's the danger of boredom.  And the problem of
losing other values through over-concentration on meter.

Sure, acquired tastes eventually feel natural.  And the too-simple
unpleasant.  I remember working at a place that played a muzak station;
fifty employee and I remember feeling rather superior because only I and
a grad student in music who was working there part-time complained about
it.  It really did make me almost physically ill.  I even purposely
turned on the computer press (back then big and noisy and I wasa
computer operator) because I preferred its sound to that of the "music,"
most of whose melodies I liked!  And I still have trouble believing
people who tell me that pop music is just noise.  To me its problem is
that it's too innocuous, too much the predictable opposite of noise.

I think if puking adults sounded like cooing babies do now and happy
babies sounded like puking adults do now, we would naturally hear puking
sounds as pleasant, cooing as unpleasant--except for the klinker that
cooing is an easy sound to make (the long o, I would say, is the easiest
sound to make, then the u in cooing--and both, come to think of it, come
into play when one is hurt), so babies by my reasoning would not
naturally make puking sounds to express content, nor puking's
sounds (biologically "chosen" to alarm others into helping, I believe,
and thus not likely to be innocuous) likely to be simple coos.

No more.  Too complicated for less than a book--and easier access to
more research, etc., than I have!!!

Judy, Lucas is not shy about sampling Earthling languages; in the
non-climatic climactic battle scene in the last of the three movies, Lando
Calrissian says something urgent to his fish-jowled copilot, who responds
in some genuine African language, I want to say Swahili--"Ten thousand
herds of elephants are standing on my foot!"

Combine that with the Star Trek episode about a planet of beings who speak
only in metaphor, and you're off.

"MUST a name mean something?" Alice asked doubtfully.

First of all, it was not Lewis Carroll who suggested that 'brillig' means
'four o'clock in the afternoon.' It was Humpty Dumpty. Now, this is the
same egg who assured Alice that 'glory' means 'there's a nice knock-down
argument for you' [Gabe Gudding, are you listening?].

When Alice questioned this meaning, H.D., of course, replied ['in a rather
scornful tone'], 'When *I* use a word it means just what I choose it to
mean -- neither more nor less.'

Seems like a lot of this list has the same theory of semantics that H.D.
has. Me, I'm with Alice on this one. I know the difference between meaning
and reference, for example [as for Carroll, he was rather close to Alice
too, on this occasion as on others, and in fact I think he was teasing us
about 'brillig'].

We are flirting with an interesting phenomenon here, though, as Jonathan
Mayhew suggests in talking about pseudo-reference. He suggests that the
reader *wants* 'brillig', etc., to be referential.

I don't question Judy Roitman's ability to _picture_, even draw in great
detail, in response to Jabberwocky. I think I can too. That's one of this
poem's great charms. But my point is that this picture that we see, that we
want to see, so well, has been accomplished by a Rube Goldberg machine, I
mean a poem, that has no real-world referenece in it.

We have recognizable meter and rhyme and stanza shape. We have utterly
regular and standard syntax and grammatical structure. We have standard
narrative conventions and cues at all of the right places. But, I think, we
have no reference.

Tristan Tzara PROMISED that if you use one of our now old-favorite cut-up
techniques to generate a random poem, 'THE POEM WILL BE LIKE YOU.'

What? Is this magic? Is it psychoanalysis? Is it poetic genius?

No, none of those.

It is, in my view, the autonomous play of language in our heads. To be more
precise, it is the play of the phonemic, morphological, metrical,
syntactic, etc., rules of a linguistic system that governs our minds far
more strictly and pervasively than Charles Bernstein governs our list.

To toss in another big gun: as Heidegger also said, Die Sprache spricht
[not us].

Language is one of those voodou loas that ride us, is my point.

Now I'll listen for a week.

On the subject of nonsense words, there's a fascinating chapter in Friedrich
Kittler's book _Discourse Networks:1800/1900_ that discusses nonsense words
emergent function for psychophysics in the late nineteenth century. Kittler
discusses the work of Hermann Ebbinghaus who conducted some of the first
empirical research on memory by forcing himself to memorize strings of
nonsense syllables (which he generated combinatorially) for hours every day
for years, in order to quantify the amount of data a mind can retain. In this
process, Ebbinghaus began losing his experiential memories as well as his
ability to speak his native language: "For the sake of a few formulas,
Ebbinghaus sacrificed (as Nietzche did for the desert) his subject of
knowledge (psychophysics). Dizzy, numbed by all the syllables, his mind became
a tabula rasa."
        But then, interestingly, Ebbinghaus performed the same experiment using,
instead of nonsense syllables, cantos from Byron's Don Juan. He found that it
made no difference to mnemonic retention whether he used nonsense or sense.
"From this point of view it almost seems as if the difference between sense
and nonsense material were not nearly so great as one would be inclined a
priori to imagine." What is important in this is that meaning and nonmeaning
(referentiality and non referentiality) become equal, as far as the mechanics
of our perception is concerned. "If the difference between sense and nonsense
dwindles, then the kingdom of sense -- that is the entire discourse network of
1800 -- sinks to the level of a secondary and exceptional phenomena."
        According to Kittler, the view that psychophysics could destroy the exotic
mystery of meaning had great repercussions in the ways people conceive of
culture and language, and especially poetry, in this century. "Instead of the
classical question of what people would be capable of if they were adequately
'cultivated'', one asks what people have always been capable of when autonomic
functions are singly and thoroughly tested."  So, in a certain sense, interest
falls away from culture, and lands on the body's own intelligible, involuntary
posessions, its limits, its unconscious, etc. From this point on, the point of
"truth" becomes the body which is in the process of "breaking down" ,"losing
its faculties", going insane. Poetry (especially the poetry discussed in this
thread: Louis Carroll, Hugo Ball; as well as Christian Morgenstern and others)
latches on to this "truth of the body", and begins to imitate it. This is why
Kittler says that much of the literature after 1900 is a "simulacrum of
madness".
        Not that I agree with everything Kittler says, but I am intrigued with the
question of whether we can think of any writing that strikes us as nonsense as
referring to a state of communication which is in some sense "insane"; a state
which might give us a window into  what we might think of as pure material,
pure body, not because it really is more material than everyday, rational
communication, but because it reveals to us the essential equanimity of the
two.

Due to technical difficulties...

Some of you may have experienced some problems with viewing the cover to
this issue of The Friend. This was the result of an effort to begin to
incorporate sound into the journal. Most of the problems have since been
resolved, and I hope you will return again. (Internet Explorer users will
probably still not hear any sound, but should no longer see any error
messages.) Feel free to write me if you continue to have difficulties - the
more specific you can be about what the problem is, what browser & version
no. you are using, what platform and what kind of a machine, &c. the better.

MLA Session, Letter Sensations and Embodied Life


from Ann Weinstone re: Our MLA session in San Francisco. Forwarded with
permission. Please come if you can. A slight outline of my own contribu-
tion follows.

======


Dear Colleagues,

I am writing to let you know about an upcoming Special Session at this
year's MLA.

Letter Sensations and Embodied Life seeks to open a different kind of
conversation about writing and biological life. We want to ask, in the
wake of poststructuralism, how we can begin to speak about the effects of
language on embodied experience. How do bodies and language transform each
other? Does the body speak or write? Do letters live?


In "Sensible Letters," Vicki Kirby connects Saussure's fascination with
anagrams, clairvoyancy, and trance induced glossolalia to current discour-
ses of artificial life. Her reading suggests that the letter may be pos-
sessed by a life force of its own that extends well beyond conventional
ideas about the ontology of language.

Alan Sondheim's "Is There a Body in This Text?" opens up notions of phys-
ical and psychical constitution to consider interpenetrations of avatar,
fleshly, and on-line entities.

Ann Weinstone's "On the Junk Beam" suggests strategies of aliteracy that
might helpfully mutate current poststructuralist/bioinformatic intensifi-
cations of the adequation of writing and making.

Jeffrey T. Schnapp will serve as chair.

The session is number 599 and will take place on Tuesday, December 29th,
1:45-3:00p.m., Union Square 21, San Francisco Hilton.

Hope to see you there!


======


(My rough outline.)


I'd like to talk on "is there a body in this text, is there a text in this
body" - using a number of approaches, depending on the time:

1 talking about the projection/introjection of emotion on the Net
  (whose emotion?)
2 talking about 1/2/3/other person on chats etc. (representations of the
  constituted body as usual)
3 ytalk, ICQ, and the (dispersed) space of the body
4 my own work with jennifer, julu, nikuko as system interrupts,
  resonances - _effusions_
6 considering the future of the Net as 'seamless virtual reality,' the
  interpenetrations and mixups on the Holodeck - Jennifer writing Alan,
  jennifer-function, body-function, quantum-logic superimpositions

I will be working from notes/outline, not a completed paper - the relation
of the body to speech is integral for me -

for the ancient greeks, peoples who spoke other languages were
collectively referred to as "hoi barbaroi," literally, people who sound
like they are saying "bar bar" -- hence, barbarians.

Actually, I had posted the review to British Poets not Poetics on the
grounds that it was a UK event. However, since it has now been mentioned
here, it might as well appear here too (sorry to those of you on both
lists). (Explanation: DAN =3D Domestic Ambient Noise, an ongoing series of
300 collaborative books of visual performance texts produced in the form of
a Theme by Bob or Lawrence which is then varied by the other. Domestic
Buoys =3D one of many nicknames for the duo.)

Probably a completely different thang, but Roger Reynolds composed a
"The Emperor of Ice Cream" for voice and... I can't recall. He also
wrote an orchestral response to "Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror."

Martin Gardner, in _The Annotated Alice_ gives a translation of this. It
goes something like:
It was midday and the smooth badgers
Were boring holes in the hillside...

This, like Finnegan's Wake, is multi-sense as opposed to strict
nonsense. No matter what any writer intends, though, we will find
references where we will.

There's a moment in Poe's "Philosophy of Composition" when he claims that
"r" is the "most producible consonant."  Since the claim comes at a rather
hyperbolic moment, when Poe is arguing that on the basis of sound alone no
other word than "Nevermore" could have served for the refrain of "The
Raven" (the long "o" also figures here as "most sonorous vowel"), I hadn't
really given it much serious thought.
But one of my students this semester made a convincing case for its
validity by making dog-like grrrrrrowling noises in his throat.  steve

Hi all.

I am thinking of using Stephen King's _The Shining_ for a comp course
next semester and was wondering if anyone had read it and what their
thoughts might be - I'm trying to decide if it'd be worthwhile to read
the book as opposed to just showing the movie, or if doing both would be
useful.

Any comments,  b/ or f/c, 'd be apurshiated.

Many thanks to Chris Nagler for a most interesting post, but I would like
to point out that context does matter to some people's memories.  In fact
some of us (I'm one) can not only only remember in context, but sometimes
can only remember the context and have to reconstruct the rest.
Ebbinghaus' experiment tells us a lot about the way Ebbinghaus' memory
worked, and, unfortunately, considering the great sacrifice he made, not
much else.

But to a singer, r is one of the most difficult sounds to make.  m & n are
so much easier.  Even percussive consonants (b, p, t etc.) are easier
because they are impossible to actually _sing_, they are just punctuation.

long o followed by ah are easy; there is a trick to eeee & when you know it
eee becomes easy.  long u is okay, short i (as in it) and similar vowels
are hard.

Anything that closes the throat is hard.  (Like, say, "hard").  "By the
rude bridge that arched the flood" (Emerson, we had to memorize it in fifth
grade) is one of the hardest lines to read out loud I know.

Just wanted to say what a great list I think Billy's assembled here.
Especially Zukofsky, McFadden, and Acker. Billy, you seduced me long ago
with your erudite posts that come a courtin' with sexy language that goes to
the head. And the heart.

Tambien for Alan Sondheim whose work would be great for wooing the Right
One. As long as they weren't Republicans.

        Listmates, it may not be too early to post this, as some of you
will be leaving your desks and heading for San Francisco very soon.

Event # 375. A Poetry Reading by David Bromige, Lyn Hejinian, and Leslie
Scalapino, 5:15-6:30 p.m., Monday Dec.28, Franciscan Room A, San Francisco
Hilton.

THIS EVENT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.(v.p.1272, "Special Events," for verification).

While I'm at it, let me mention also Event # 181, "The Poetics of Robert
Duncan," 8:30-9:45 a.m., Monday Dec. 28, Parlor 9, Continental Ballroom,
San Francisco Hilton. Session Leader : Burton Hatlen. Panelists: Robert
Bertholf ("Serial Form in RD's 'Medieval Scenes'"), Devin Johnston
("'Sublime Undoing' :RD and the Metaphysics of Dictation"), and David
Bromige ("A Poetics of Delivery : RD's Reading of 'Moving the Moving
Image'").

 My paper looks at an article I published in 1975 on Duncan's 1970 reading
aloud of this poem (Passages 17), focussing on the excerpts from the
"Perfect Sermon or the Asclepius" included in that poem; and at Duncan's
letter to me in response to this article ("You've centered in on one of the
most tricky intents in Passages for me too. And one I still feel so
uncomfortable about that I avoid tackling it"). My paper concerns much else
besides : a turn in a literary friendship, the tedding-out of two sets of
poetics, an Oedipal interlude, foreshadowings of Poetry Wars to come;
gender, class, behaviorism and free will, ancient Greek Egypt, 19th Century
Britain, and USA 1970's.  NOT OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. (Would give 'em
nightmares!)

I'll re-post this Xmas Eve or near as dammit.  David

Interesting paradox here.  "R" is an easy sound to make in a kind of
crude, animal-like grrrrrrowling way, but difficult to make when singing,
projecting, articulating.  This doesn't reflect well on Poe's arguments
vis a vis "Nevermore."

It might also be pointed out that when dogs sing, which happpens quite
often in my neighborhood, they go for the "oooooooo."

Since Spicer has not been mentioned in nigh on a couple of weeks now:

"Drugs" from "Homage to Creeley"

The bell went "rrrr"
And we both went "rrrr"
And there was a beauty
In talking to him.

But angel-talk howls
At the edge of our beds
And all of us now
Are partners of hell.

For the crocodile crys
Every tear that we know
And our tears are our blankets
Wherever we go.
______________________________

As the explanatory notes to this section and others make clear, the Alice
books figure prominently here (in hell).

Spicer's take on the costs of language use is complex enough to swamp his
little poem-boats, and I'm not a fast enough bailer.  Those fluent in
Martian may be able to help out....

MTV Apologizes to Teen for Bad Edit

 MTV Apologizes to Teen for Bad Edit
           HAMILTON, N.J. (AP) _ A teenage boy who won a nationwide contest
 to interview a rap group on MTV says the cable channel aired a
 segment that was horribly out of tune.
           The 24-hour music network has apologized to Bradley Jenkins, and
 agreed to redo a segment that the family claims portrays them as
 destitute and unhappy.
           ``When you look at the tape, it looks like my life is really bad
 and my family is really broken,'' the boy told The Times of Trenton
 in Monday's editions. ``It was supposed to be a really positive
 experience for me and it turned out to be really horrible.''
           Jenkins was chosen to interview the hip-hop group A Tribe Called
 Quest. The network boiled down 20 hours of film into a 12-minute
 segment that showed a down-and-out family and a teen lifted from
 despair by the group's positive message.
           Bradley's father, Walter Jenkins, said he and his wife were so
 upset by the segment that they missed several days of work. They
 said worried relatives from as far away as Oklahoma started calling
 the family to ask if anything was wrong.
           ``I can't put into words how totally disappointing this thing
 is,'' Walter Jenkins said. ``How could they do that? Maybe they've
 got this one editor with a tabloid mentality or something.''
           MTV producers and editors called the family last week to
 apologize. They also re-edited the segment to remove the
 embarrassing parts.
           ``We want to make people happy,'' MTV spokeswoman Marnie Malter
 said. ``We want this experience to be wonderful for everyone. We
 think it's a terrific episode that presents Brad in a positive
 light.''
           Bradley plays varsity football, baseball and basketball at
 Steinert High School, and is a member of Future Business Leaders of
 America. His grades are in the A and B range, and he sometimes
 performs as an actor in Princeton's McCarter Theatre.

OK -- that message was for Michael Bibby -- sorry --

By the way, if you check out the footnotes to the Starr Report you'll find
Lewinsky's thankyou note to the President for the copy of LEAVES OF GRASS
-- a hoot in itself --

The Report also describes VOX as a book about phone sex -- I suppose that's
true enough, in the same sense that GREAT GATSBY is a book about Long

So here I am back in Illinois for a month, and I've left the books I
need 4,200 miles away in Sweden.  So:

I'm looking for the passage where Paul De Man, comparing himself to
Derrida, says that the difference between them is that "I can do nothing
without a text" (or words to that effect).  Anyone know where to look?


By the way -- there was a fascinating talk by Marjorie Perloff and
Charles Bernstein at the Museum of Contemporary Art a couple of days
ago, with a couple of listees in the audience.  Although the title of
the talk referred to "the future of poetry" much of the talk had to do
with the past, with the 20 year history of language poetry.  Bernstein
began with a slide of cro-magnon man making cave paintings in a dreary
cavern and the comment "this was the state of poetry before my magazine
-- you can see the poets struggling with the problem of the personal
lyric."  Best send-up of "heroic langpo" I've witnessed.

Also good to hear in the after-show schmooze that Marjorie is co-writing
a book on poetics with Steve Fredman and Gerry Bruns, two of my profs
from Notre Dame.  Should be of interest to a lot of listees -- Fredman's
"Poet's Prose" was a really fine book, and Bruns' "Modern Poetry and the
Idea of Language" deserves to be read by more people.

Joe Amato -- you were there.  What'd you think?

Herr Doktor Bromige -- I'll send the pictures of Bjuv, Sweden as soon as
they're developed.

I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVES BY BORIS VIAN (1920-1959)
ISBN  0-9662346-0-X     Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 97-80958
Translated from the  French by Boris Vian & Milton Rosenthal  200 pp.  $17.00

        The most talked about novel of the year in Paris in 1947 was the
work of an American black writer, but he was not Richard Wright.  The book
was published in French as J'irai cracher sur vos tombes, by Vernon
Sullivan.  The English title would be "I Spit on Your Graves", but as was
expected in a preface by the book's translator - Boris Vian, again -
Sullivan had no hope of seeing his work published in his native country.
For one thing, it was obscene, containing many descriptions of sexual acts.
For another, it was extremely violent, and the violence was that of a
black against whites.  "J'irai cracher sur vos tombes" charts the erotic
adventures of a light-skinned Negro, Lee Anderson, after he takes up a job
managing a bookshop in the small Southern town of Buckton.  Like Joe
Christmas in Faulkner's novel Light in August, Lee is light enough to pass
for white.  He becomes fixated on two sisters,but his desire to dominate
them sexually is morbidly, fatally, connected to a need to obtained
vengeance on behalf of his darker-skinned brother, a victim of white
violence in the past. Seducing a series of white girls with pathologically
inspired energy, Lee revels in a private revenge (they do not realize he is
a Negro); but it is not sufficient to satisfy him, and in the end he
murders both sisters, before being killed himself by a police bullet.

        According to the translator, Sullivan's light skin would have
enabled him to live, like his protagonist, among whites, but he preferred
'les Noirs'.  While "J'irai cracher sur vos tombes" became highly
successful, Sullivan remained an enigma.  In fact, this Afro-American novel
was a hoax.  The book had been written in French, and 'Sullivan' was a
ghost.  His real name was Boris Vian.

Taken from PARIS INTERZONE by James Campbell


#
        "Published in Paris in 1946 as a thriller loaded with sex and
blood, allegedly censored in the US and "translated" into French, J'irai
cracher sur vos tombes --I Spit on Your Graves-- was a pure mystification,
but also a direct homage to American literature and movies, by a young
author, Boris Vian (1920-1959).

        More deeply, it was also a violent attack on racism by a jazz fan
who had already befriended many black musicians and was to become the
closest French friend of Ellington, Davis and Parker.

        The novel became a best seller in France and established a
scandalous reputation for Vian.  But for the past forty years, Vian has
become one of the most famous writers of the mid 20th Century, as his hoax
of 1946 is only one example --provocative and outrageous, though powerful
and meaningful -- of his prolific production: novels and short stories,
plays and songs."

-Gilbert Pestureau

        "In the tradition of Karl May and Franz Kafka, Boris Vian imagines
an America even more amazing than the land he has never visited.  I Spit on
Your Graves is the first novel to put quotation marks around the
'hardboiled'  --a vivid and startling performance."
-J. Hoberman

        "To Americans Boris Vian has long been one of the hidden glories of
French literature.  In I Spit on Your Graves, he wrote an utterly untypical
work, a blast from his Id that may well have killed him.  Even now, with
misogyny disguised as racial justice, its venom remains potent and
disturbing, in equal parts appalling and riveting.  It is a singular book,
not for the squeamish, and not to be passed by."

for one's beloved?... i'll be a bit old-fashioned... dover puts out a nice
little boxed-set of "great women poets" in four volumes (costs but $5-6)...
it might do the trick... incl. is

christina rossetti, _goblin market, and other poems_
elizabeth barrett browning, _sonnets from the portuguese, and other poems_
edna st. vincent millay, _renascence, and other poems_
emily dickinson, _selected poems_

i'll sneak this in here, b/c i think it's important and urgent enough:  the

about _the shining_:  i view the film, anyway, differently than i once
did... but one aspect worth looking for, i think, is the effect of
isolation/solitude on the writing process... that is, the film might be
understood as making a good (if completely over-the-top) case for
collaboration (in the most general sense) as an essential aspect of the
composing process, requiring some 'input' from outside the writer's
consciousness... in the absence of which, you go NUTS (which of course
leads to the question of cerebral architectures etc.)... i haven't worked
any of this out, and it's certainly a stretch for me to say so (esp. given
that i haven't 'explained' the apparent haunting embedded in the
plot)---but i have to admit to getting a kick out of nicholson's reaction
whenever shelly duvall interrupts his typing... most of you who've lived
with another writer can probably relate---which is not to say that, in the
end, we all don't *need* interruption as such...

well anyhow...

kass and i had a ball listening to marjorie and charles... i mean,
*listening* to marjorie and charles!... the two are obviously comfortable

as to substance:  i found their talk both accessible and provocative,
exhibiting far more intellectual reach than i generally enjoy at such

marjorie's ruminations as to how statements of poetic intent have become

charles's collapse of the "theory vs. [poetry, e.g.]" distinction into the

yes indeed, though I don't know this translation, (well, Vian himself was
involved, so it should be good)  the book is highly recommended -- one of the
absolute hits of my adolescence -- sent me straight to the classic amerikan
klassik krime  writers. Don't know if the other two great Vian novels are
available here (_L'Ecume des Jours_, the Foam of the Days, or something like
that, which has a wonderful character called Jean-Saul Partre, and _L'Automne à
Peking_, Autumn in Peking) -- if not, hey, Tosh, what you're waiting for?
(_L'Ecume_ has a major prop -- a cocktail-piano, where every string, besides
creating sound, is attached to a bottle that pours, so that you can create a
wild range of cocktails, depending on the tune you play).

Apologies for the length of the ensuing. I have excised it from a
considerably longer, complete piece. Without a substantial portion, the
effects will not be apparent.


MY POETRY

David Bromige, 1978

My poetry does seem to have a cumulative, haunting effect--one or two poems
may not touch you, but a small bookful begins to etch a response, poems
rising in blisters that itch for weeks, poems like ball-bearings turning on
each other, over & over, digging down far enough to find substance, a hard
core to fill up the hand.  It's through this small square that my poems
project themselves, flickering across the consciousness, finally polarizing
in the pure plasma of life. The reader grows impatient, irritated with my
distancing style, coming at him in the rare book format, written under not
one but two different kinds of dirty money, & knowing me to be an english
teacher.

"The Protestant Poem" & the prose piece "He Was" typify my tendency to
write over-elaborated series of possibilities which become arid & abstract.
It's possible for even the best current poetry to sink into oblivion
without wholly justifying itself through such an absolute renunciation of
mediocre success. "The Protestant Poem" & certainly, "He Was," are not
arid, they're great (except maybe, "kaleidoscopic world").  My poetry is
"curiouser & curiouser" as it makes a descent into the rabbit-hole where
descent becomes the subject of the poem's concern....

At this point, then, we begin to glimpse what is the profound vocation of
the work of art in a commodity society : not to be a commodity, not to be
consumed, not to be a vacation. Isn't this the piece talking to itself,
hoping to be overheard, & contradicted. Because, the interest evident in
the construction, rhythm of the sentences, obviates the need for the
content. (Not to deny the feelings, of course). And I, as you probably do
_not_ know, am a sucker for children in pain. If you allow Cezanne to
represent a third dimension on his canvas, you must allow Landseer his
gleam of loyalty in the spaniel's eye. I really don't think I'm demanding
too much. The idea that poetry is good fora person & should be choked down
like a horse pill is ridiculous....

Bernstein composes using a vocabulary which at all points (nearly) proposes
itself as the other--this vulnerability, constantly expressed, is a sign of
what (why does he insist on it?)--yet "what I want to call attention to is
that there is no natural writing style" which of course is exactly what
Barthes was sayiong in '53, _non_ ? These are the poles & what moves the
piece is that there is no resolution, point of equilibrium. Here too, the
problematic mode proposed as a strategy for composition, as such--this
whole body of poems is a big jump forward for me, in that I'm no longer
writing "just poems," each work is somehow myself....

The constant erasure of signs for presence leaves the poem an interstitial
agent in the service of intentionality, & the uncertainties & doubts which
Keats saw as the essential condition for poetic creation become the
characteristics of generation in any form. The non-instrumental, which
gives instance of what stands for itself & so not a call to revolution or a
representation of the struggle & how it is peopled, but an instance of it
(product, the unalienated or re-integrated itself : while still putting off
(& on) other myths of "presence" which turn on a misunderstanding of how
language operates & how we operate in it, which is to say no e,y,e,s).

The blurb on the book says the usual blurb-things. "David Bromige writes
carefully, with _pleasure_ --which is the point." Well, which _is_ ? I am
the author of previous books, which is the point. A stunning achievement.
Good images ("as carefree as a coffin-nail commercial"), & often a good use
of language."Still there" is a remarkably clear, beautiful poem.  The poem
ceases to be a process of discovery. You go to step on the boardwalk & it's
rotten. I try to transcend my petty anger & bring you into an area of
engagement under the rule of Poetry. Notes are made along the way toward a
remembered edifice. Even a divine physics cannot make categorical
thought-determinations of realities intuitable in the plain, ordinary way ;
as little as divine omnipotence can bring it about that elliptical
functions should be painted or played on the fiddle. The tone is objective,
rendered ironic by contrast with the monstrous behavior portrayed. What
does the "one who knew this" know?....

In my poetry the search shows, & so do the seams often, but my poetry gains
authenticity from its deliberate ruggedness. Bull shit. Everywhere there is
the tension of an incomplete sentence, an ambiguous antecedent, an
unnatural act, an illogical causality.

                A sentence, as the expression of a
                complete thought, is not natural &
                does not exist in nature.  Is not
                natural & does not exist in nature.

The prose pieces are of a deft, deadpan order, hinting at more than they
state. It's difficult to say whether this prose makes too much ordinary
sense, for it is less zany & irritating than _Tender Buttons_ --as if that
were some kind of discus mark set in 1911 for extra-syntactic competitors.
Yet is it teasingly nonsensical when it is most clipped & aphoristic....A
slight, simple poem is slight & simple, & for A.R.Ammons there's no getting
away from that. I've been thinking lately about some sort of code of ethics
for reviewers. Everywhere the ceremonies of the Phallus are rehearsed,
questioned & continued. It is that agonizing lust to express with which I
can personally empathize....The poet A.W. Purdy was gleeful :

         I have a very low opinion of the Black Mountain
         "method" of writing poems (which is partly the
         exclusion of any other method) & have seen some
         of David Bromige's reviews of myself & others before.

Either poetry is real, real as, or, as Shelley for one believed, realler
than, life; or it is nothing, a stupid & stupefying occupation for zombies.
Freud's condensation & displacement are figured here in the poet's
tasks....

This is just to say I've gained the art & language in which I bring my
readers deeper than any consideration of a personality to the awarenss of a
living man -- hence in reading these recent books of mine one may find
oneself in a solitude & a -- "Tight Corner," I might call it--edge or risk
of Being that seems even as it is most mine to be speaking for a depth of
one's own inner being. Climb bean sort of is substitute destiny. Extremely
useful & succinct on the problem of writing verses literature. Silence
amounts to the same thing, recommended for university & large college
libraries :

                     _Sign on Librarian's Desk_

                           R E V E N G E

I could never have done it alone. The self to write about the products of
the self which the self tries to make as selfless as possible, in order
that they may be seen to come from the true self, by involving it with &
invoking it for contiguous other selves (readers)...;

[etc, etc].

This, in its uncut version, appeared in Perelman & Shaw's _Hills_ , then in
_My Poetry_ from The Figures, 1980. This book is long o.p. & Sun & Moon at
one point expressed intention to bring it back into print, with an intro by
Ron Silliman; the intro has been written, but the reprint, though
announced, appears unlikely.

I thank you, if you have come this far, for your attention.  David

I used to routinely ask students to list "most beautiful" words (also
"funniest"). My favorite response to the former was that of a rather shy
woman: "syringe." The only "funniest" I recall was "chum."

I heard a legend about an immigrant couple who named their child what they
thought was the most beautiful word in the english language-- "diarrhea."

I'm actually in love with pharmacological words--my recent favorite is
"Propecia," the name of a hair growth drug for men. Zithromax is good,
too.

That "Asian" must have read the Paris Review interview with Don DeLillo (in
the 40th anniversary issue, a few years back) where, in a discussion about
the famous "Toyota Celica" passage in _White Noise_, he cites an alleged
study that reached the same conclusion.

One of the highlights of the MLA convention later this month in San Francisco
is surely the Lyn Hejinian, Leslie Scalapino, and David Bromige reading,
organized by Burton Hatlen. Not to be missed. It was a treat to read David's
"My Poetry" just now on the list: a work I have been totally amazed by since I
first read it and David is quite right that "My Poetry" is exemplary of the
sort of  writing I had in mind in my comments in Chicago the other night.

Anyway, back to the MLA: by a cruel quirk of fate, the Poetry Division cash
bar
and book party is at the same time as the reading and while conflicts are
endemic to these conventions, this one is particularly unfortunate.

The Poetry Division cash bar and book party follows a reading and conversation
with Adrienne Rich, which takes place Monday Dec. 28, 3:30-4:45. The Cash Bar
goes from 5:15-6:30. Both events are in Plaza Room A, San Francisco Hilton.
The
book party is for Rich’s new collection Midnight Savage (Norton) and for Close
Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word, which I edited (Oxford Univ. Press),
Imagining Language, ed. Steve McCaffery and Jed Rasula (M.I.T. Press), and
Poems
for the Millennium, vol. 2, ed. Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris (Univ. of
California Press). Rich and all the editors will be present.

Since the Rich reading ends at 4:45, perhaps those attending the
Bromige/Heninian/Scalapino reading can come by Plaza Room A at that time, and
hang out till 5:15, when the reading starts, since it takes place very nearby
(Franciscan Room A). I think most of us will be there then, and hopefully at
least sample copies of the books will be there too -- even if we have to wait
for them to set up the bar. Oxford tells me they will be offering Close
Listening at a 50% discount at the party (eg: $10). If  the book selling is
not
in place by 5:15, I will take orders and have any books ready, signed by any
and all present, by the time the reading is over.

This discussion of syllable sounds calls to mind Antin's talk 'the
structuralist' with its tale of a red-haired dwarf painter/linguist who
writes a poem using only "submorphemic sememes," e.g. phonemes or
combinations of phonemes that seem to signify *naturally*.  For example gl
is the "sememe of visual manifestation" (197), as in glimmer, glance,
gloom, glimpse, etc... Also check out Genette's Mimologiques (translated
as Mimologics).  The Antin piece is in the book _what it means to be
avant-garde_  (New Directions 1993).

tom, basically marjorie was arguing that it's become all the rage to
fashion one's "poetics" ex post facto, and that in many cases said poetics
are neither urgent nor compelling... she referenced, e.g., the collection
of such statements at the back of many anthologies of poetry...

charles was questioning whether in fact "theory" wasn't itself often used
as a way of narrowing---pinching---discourse... he would prefer, as i
understood him, to think of the essay form itself as permitting for
theoretical speculation---whether by poet or by critic... he did reserve a
place for philosophy as the proper site of more rigorous thought (as
opposed, that is, to theory)...

perhaps it will help if i clarify a bit why i asked my question:  it seems
to me that an argument can be made that what distinguishes much of the more
oppositional/alternative/non-mainstream writing is a willingness to
theorize one's "craft" (i use the latter with some skepticism intact---the
word often constitutes the alpha & omega of theoretical speculation on the
part of more conventional writers for whom (e.g.) de man's "resistance to
theory" is already theoretically excessive)... jed rasula has argued this
vis-a-vis the beats, and i think the same might be said of language
poetry-writing (though might not be said, perhaps, of more populist poetic
forms and events)... how academic and professionalizing forces figure into
the question of "theory" (note quotes here) is a matter i'll leave open for
the moment... suffice to say that, when i used the term, i do not mean to
delimit theory in popperian terms (i.e., falsification etc.), and that
"theory" is certainly a commodity in academe these days (albeit not the
commodity it was even a decade ago)...

so to suggest that "theory"---a basic self-reflexive quality, a challenging
of one's own assumptions---need not be so constraining, and yet is at the
same time an important part of one's practice, situates one somewhat contra
certain academic work, and at the same time, contra certain artistic
presumptions (e.g., "just feel it")...

the question remains though:  since theory as such constitutes a literacy
(as we've known it thus far) completely tied-up with print literacy, and
since any move toward the visual (or the aural) takes us away from the
latter (not in a strict sense, but generally)---how might we "theorize"
(note quotes again) our poetic articulations so conceived w/o forcing
visual-aural work to tow what is in essence a literary line?... how do you
theorize words/images/sounds w/o selling images and sounds short? (a
picture is worth a thousand etc.)...

nothing exactly "new" here, nothing unprecedented, and nothing that hasn't
been the focus of all sortsa discussion... but i think it's becoming more
and more topical, esp. in light of our electronic media... and i could,
too, toss around words like "hybrid," "creolized," even collage, etc., to
point to possible ways of addressing this issue... but worth thinking
through, i think, however one does so...

best,

joe

Didn't someone famously state that the most beautiful word in English was
"elbow"? But I'd have to agree that "cellardoor" sounds gorgeous: it sounds
un-English, perhaps the exotic island of Selador, or perhaps "c'est la
d'or".

As for me, the two most beautiful words in the English language are
"Transaction Accepted".


And speaking of syllable sounds & Lewis Carroll, I remember that in Godel,
Escher, Bach there are 'translations' of Jaberwocky into French & German,
with very strange and revealing results. Does anyone know who the
translators were?


        Cheers,

Just a reminder that the new _Tinfish_ is available.  Each cover is--in
part--a different weather map of the Pacific (Gaye Chan fished them out of a
National Weather Service dumpster); I found one map with two typhoons and a
tropical depression.  So order more than one and partake in Pacific flux!  $5
per and $13 for a subscription to three.  They make great holiday gifts, as do
our chapbooks (ask backchannel about any of this).

I won't be at MLA, but best wishes to everyone who will be, especially those

I agree with Jen Hofer's post a few weeks back, where she argued "it is
firmly my belief that all words reference." For a word or utterance to truly
lack a reference would require, in my mind,  that it had no dissimilarity
from all other utterances that, through differences, would define it. I mean
to say that context seems most important when one reads-- for example--
"brillig" in a poem,  in this case, by Louis Carroll. Even it if lacks a
clear definition or dictionary entry, it still points towards a possible
meaning, even if that meaning might be in permanent abeyance. And we can say
all sorts of interesting things about it, what it attempts to do, how it
undermines x and y, how it fits the syntax of this or that, and so on. So in
the end I would argue that it signifies, and that we demand that it does. I
think even something as unrecognizable as Hugo Ball's sound poetry or Kurt
Schwitter's _Ur Sonata_ still refer, they re-ferre, literally  in the Latin
"carry-back, report," (actually a military term all over Caesar's _Gallic
Wars_)upon what exactly, I would agree, is clearly open to debate. Even if
you can't read Bob Grenier's work, it still signifies, in fact we tend to
insist that it does. I find it hard to imagine a non-referential language,
the two seem incompatible. As far as sounds and syllables and the men and
women who loved them, Shelley voted "syphilis" the most pleasing word to the
ear in the language.

EMI Stops Production of Nazi Songs
           COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ International recording label EMI says
 it has stopped production of a cassette by German folk singer Heino
 that contains traditional marching songs the Nazis used during
 World War II.
           The cassette, titled ``As We March Side By Side,'' was produced
 several years ago but never marketed commercially because of EMI's
 concerns about its content, EMI spokesman Erich Grote said Monday
 in Cologne.
           The 60-year-old Heino, popular mostly with older Germans, has
 been singing folk music since the 1960s. ``As We March Side By
 Side'' contains songs popular before the Third Reich but exploited
 by the Nazis as propaganda about the glories of Germany.
           Heino also sings the German national anthem on the cassette,
 including the original first verse that was banned after the war.
 It begins: ``Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles,'' or ``Germany
 above all.''
           The decision to stop production of the cassette followed a
 German TV report that ``As We March ...'' was being offered for
 sale by mail order in the extreme right-wing German National
 Newspaper.
           ``This was an unpleasant surprise,'' the EMI spokesman told The
 Associated Press. ``We immediately informed our customers that we
 would not fill any more orders (for the cassette), because we in no
 way want to support this kind of product.''
           Heino was not immediately available for comment about EMI's
 decision.
           The newspaper, published in Munich by politician Gerhard Frey,
 had been running the mail-order advertisements for about a year,
 the station ARD reported.

Sadly, strangely, unfortunately, or coincidentally, no one I've ever
courted (or been beloveds with) has had a lick of interest in poetry.
I'd feel like Alvy Singer pushing death & dying books on Annie Hall.

HowEVer, if anyone out there wants to come a'courtin here, I'll be happy
to provide an extensive, alphabetized list that'd work at least as well
as a backrub-with-motives, beginning, now that Charles mentions it, with
*Close Listening* and vol.2 of *Poems for the Millenium*.

This Heino truly is disturbed.  I've seen footage of performances (70's?)
that do not present a "folk singer" of the traditional long hair, acoustic
guitar playing,
granola in the back pocket genre.

Some were quite entertaining, even innovative (a stand in does some karate
kicks and flips, really "gets down"  for him during one song - a feat only
Madonna has replicated since), but a piece I remember vividly was of the
suit clad Heino singing to some underage girls while obviously oogling them
from behind his trademark sunglasses.  However, he does only hold their
hands, stroke their shoulders.  Not too shabby for a grown man.  The old
celebration of the respectable drooling perv.  He reminded me of the scalely
men who "fed pigeons" in the park where my teen girlfriends and I met up to
smoke.

I feel everything about everything. It seems at some point. Or all at the same
time. For instance now. This list. I am certain you are all kind hearted

All my friends tell me that Heino is cool (in sort of a bad retro way). Are
there any plans to publish the complete lyrics of Heino?

Dear Listees:

Having received the following message on U. Penn's LINGUIST listserv, I
tried to produce a poem that would lose nothing [well, almost nothing] in
translation.

It uses [except for "a" and "in"] words which K. S. Chung regards as
strong candidates for words recognized pretty much everywhere around the
world [though a Turkish student tells me that "curry" doesn't work in her
language]. I confess I couldn't bring myself to use "golf," but I did get
all the others into the piece.

So: the first 'international' poem that loses nothing [asuming it has
something to begin with!] in translation:


SAUNA


neon alleluias!
chocolate ninja czar
a shock in yoga-jazz
curry T-shirt!
OK, cocoa bikini!
platinum card!

Subject:  International Words

Last August I posted a query regarding 'international' words (LINGUIST
9.1151) like _chocolate_, which seem to end up as phonetic loans in
just about any language/culture that is acquainted with the referent
concerned.

I got quite a few interesting replies, which I've collated below.

I'd like to ask a further question here: Does anyone know of a word or
words for 'chocolate' in native Mexican/Mesoamerican languages? One
correspondent, Antony Dubach Green in Germany, suggested that if any
language had a word for 'chocolate' that is not somehow a phonetic
loan of _chocolate_, it would most likely be a Mexican language, where
chocolate is native (Nahuatl: _xoco_ 'bitter' + _atl_ 'water').

John Koontz gave some very detailed and interesting information on
Omaha-Ponca and Teton Dakotan, offering exmaples of non-cognate words
for 'tea'. See also the note below on 'coffee' in Amharic from Robert
Ratcliffe in Japan. Please reply to me privately if you have any
further input on any of the above data.

John Koontz offered a useful suggestion, i.e. that maybe one cannot be
too absolutist in looking for a word that is a phonetic loan in *all*
known languages. His comment:

> I haven't thought of any potential international non-food terms.  I
> wonder, though, if you might not need to be somewhat less than
> absolute in identifying such terms.  Widespread and crossing the
> boundaries of known relationships, or of known origin, might suffice.

This makes sense, since words like 'tea' and 'coffee' get pretty
*close* to being 'international' words, based on the data collected so
far.

Below follow lists of possible candidates for international words,
along with others that failed either the Chinese or another language
test, based on the responses I received. I used Mandarin Chinese as a
key test since it is a language that tends to use loan
translations/calques or original coinings where possible rather than
phonetic loans.


Possible 'international word' candidates (that pass the Chinese test):

        alleluia
        bikini
        card
        [the chemical elements]
        chocolate
        cocoa
        curry
        czar/tsar
        golf
        jazz
        ninja
        OK
        sauna
        shock
        T-shirt
        yoga


Words suggested that didn't pass the Chinese (or some other) test:

        alcohol
        allergy
        automobile
        banana

        Notes

*But take Coffee.  It is indigenous to the area around the strait of
Bab-el-Mandeb, that is Yemen and Ethiopia. In Yemen (that is in
Arabic) it is called _qahwah_, which becomes _kahve_ in Turkish _kafe_
in Italian _kawfi_ in English _koohi_ in Japanese. But in Ethiopia (at
least in Amharic) it is called _bunn_. This word _bunn_ is also used
in Arabic to refer to fresh coffee beans, before they are roasted and
ground. I hope some Americanist on the list will have an interesting
story to tell about chocolate.

**Omaha-Ponca xa'de maN'kkaN 'tea; lit. grass (or herb) medicine'
Omaha-Ponca maN'kkaN sa'be 'coffee; lit. black medicine' Teton Dakotan
c^haNkhal'yapi 'tea; lit. warmed wood (bark)' Teton Dakotan phez^u'ta
sa'pa 'coffee; lit. black medicine (or weed)' Omaha-Ponca and Dakotan
are Siouan languages (North America). In Omaha-Ponca there are no
words for chocolate or curry, though presumably the English terms
would be used, with little or no adaptation. Omaha-Ponca is certainly
not without loan words and certain vocabulary fields (dates, numbers,
English given names) are normally filled with more or less unadapted
English terms.  However, I think there is a feeling that such foreign
words are expedients rather than naturalized, and in general there is
some resistance to loans.  They seem to be much less prevalent than in
European languages.  Calques are more common, often from the old trade
pidgin in the case of European items, e.g., ppe'de niN' 'fire water'
for 'whiskey' (cf. ardent spirits?) or maN'ze ska' 'white metal' for
'money' (cf. French argent?).

A young boy (his parents were born in Vietnam) at my children's school (in
Sydney, Australia) had a Vietnamese name which unfortunately sounded very
rude in English. A teacher spoke to the parents and tactfully suggested
that their child would have a less miserable time at school if he changed
his name.
After considerable thought they agreed, carefully chose a neutral-sounding
English name, and registered it by deed poll.
The boy wore his new name with pride:
Germain Grommet.

"This issue of _New Observations_ focuses on Cultures of Cyberspace - the
kinds of exchanges and communities that have grown out of the Net over the
past twenty years or so. The oldest document is a reproduction of a dia-
gram from a 1972 paper describing failures in the original ARPA network,
the ancestor of today's online monster. [...] The illustrations have been
chosen as a counterpoint to the texts; they reflect spaces and bodies that
are effaced, occluded, ghostlike - in short _uncanny_ spaces that, to my
mind at least, parallel the 'feeling' of being online."

I must say I'm quite pleased with the publication - which captures a cer-
tain aspect of online subjectivity. The articles range from accounts of
the phenomenology of email lists to a description of ThePalace, from MUD
and MOO analyses to posts from alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb.

The writers include Michael Spirito, Miekal And, Ryan Whyte, Eve Andree
Laramee, Jerry Everard, John Suler, Caitlin Martin, Adrianne Wortzel,
Radhika Gajjala, addicted2words, S. McKenzie, Nick Mamatas, Ted in St.
Louis, Jon Marshall, Alexanne Don, Art McGee, Laurie Cubbison, Steven
Meinking, Drew Shiel, Paula Davidson, Amy Fletcher, and Guiseppe Iann-
icelli. Artists include David Smith, Fanny Jacobson, Janieta Eyer, Emily
Cheng, Thomas Zummer, Tyler Stallings, Nancy Haynes, Wenda Gu, Ichi Ikeda,
Robert Cheatham, Barbara Simcoe, Kim Mcglynn, and Alice Glenn, among
others.

***  An impeachable offense:
     As if President Clinton doesn't have enough trouble on Capitol Hill, now
he's got problems down under.  Er, ah, Down Under.  It seems that organizers
of Madame Tussaud's traveling wax museum of 110 life-like statues have
encountered some troubles in Sydney, Australia.  Their guests just can't keep
their hands off of the Clinton model's naughty bits, unzipping his pants as a
prank.  So, Vicky Brown, general manager of the exhibition has ordered Mr.
President's fly sewn shut.  Prior to her stratagem, security guards were
checking on Clinton's state of affairs every couple of hours to "avoid
embarrassment," Brown said.

I have always been fascinated by the sound of Farts (the word, people).  I
love Dentals and Fricatives.  I also love fajitas, which might explain
some of my attraction to this word.  Ferret is also a perky word and
possesses at least one very sharp Dental.  Note how the introduction of the
words Ferret and Fart radically change the sonic texture of this bit from
Genesis.


Ferret was wroth with his servants, and put me in a ward in the captain of
the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: And we dreamed each man
according to the interpretation of his dream.  And there was there with us
an young man, an Hebrew, an servant of the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to
his dream he did interpret.

Ferret sent and called for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the
dungeons: and he shaved himself and changed his raiment, and came in unto
ferret.  And ferret said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst
understand a dream.

That is when Joseph turned into a fart and was inhaled by degrees.

|& I remember some piece of research years ago that found that for most

ye-e--e---ss
but at this closeness surely the euphony is tied up with the voice of the
individual uttering and the auditor's response to that pronunciation

Pierre uttering "carcinoma" would produce a very different set of sounds
to... say Kate Adie - a BBC correspondent of great verbal-vocal precision,
arising not least from her being half or more Swedish - I am *assuming you
will have heard her. In case not, let's say Jerome Rothenberg... or Steve
McCaffery - gender balance! or Karen MacCormack or Anne Waldman. All quite
different in what they would do with that set of sounds. Given the range of
pronunciations /musical effects available to speakers, I don't see how one
word could be awarded an unequivocal accolade as the euphonically most
beautiful word

AND the situation changes when the one word is put with another:
cellardoor carcinoma
OR

quite different sonic  AND stress interrelationships

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I neglected to mention in my announcement yesterday about the MLA events that the ones I listed are free and open to the public; and indeed the idea for these events was, in part, to have a few poetry-related events open to poets living in the Bay area:

David Bromige/Lyn Hejinian/Leslie Scalapino reading: Monday, 28 December, 5:15pm. Franciscan Room A, Hilton, which is the Ballroom Level, Building 1.

Adrienne Rich Reading (followed by conversation): Monday, 28 December, 3:30-4:45, Plaza Room A, Hilton, which is immediately followed, in the same room, by Poetry Division Cash Bar and book party for Rich, and for Poems for the Millennium II, Close Listening, and Imagining Language. Plaza Room A is on the Lobby Level, Building 1

Other MLA events free and open to the public include these five readings, which, remarkably, all take place *at the same time!*: 5:15-6:30 on Tuesday, December 29 in the Hilton (titles for readings are those listed in the program):

John Kinsella in Franciscan Room A

Hypermeida Poetry/Fiction with Stephanie Strickland & M. D. Coverley in Parlor 2, Continental Ballroom

Charles Wright in Continental Ballroom 6

West Coast Native Women's Poetry with Gloria Bird, Janice Gould,   Deborah A. Miranda, and Nora Davenhauer in Yosemite Room B

Asian American Writers Catherine Liu & R. Zamora Linmark in Union Square 15 and 16

In addition, there is a free reading by Czeslaw Milosz: 12/27, 7pm, Yosemite Room A

Another things SF area folks who are not registered might enjoy is the great and large book exhibit. According to the convention program, "MLA convention registrants may obtain free passes to the exhibit hall for guests they accompany in the hall. Persons who are not registered for the convention and who are not  guests of registrants may purchase a one-day pass to the exhibit hall for $10. These passes are available near the entrance to the exhibit hall." Well worth the $10, by the way. The book exhibit is in the Grand Ballroom Salon A and B, Building 2, San Francisco Hilton.

I can't believe "alcohol" didn't "pass the test"! But I vote, today, for
OK, cocoa bikini
as having very pleasing shape to tongue and ear.

Meanwhile, a two-headed question for any takers:
1) How do you (or do you?) guard yourself / your work against people who
are inclined to, for example, question your lover in pointed detail
about your sex life after hearing you read? These people, it should be
noted, do not question the poet about the work, but the assumed
subject/object of the work about itself.

2) If people insist on referring one's work back to one's lover, how to
protect the lover (not in a sheltering sense, but a compassionate one)
from feeling attacked by the work?

(Sorry if this is a bit, I feel necessarily, vague -- but would greatly
appreciate any thoughts along these lines.)

In minor poetic crisis, seeking extra soothing syllable sounds,
Laura

Laura: How incredibly rude!  I'm sure Miss Manners would tell your lover
to say, politely, "It's actually none of your business" and leave it at
that.  Why anyone would feel obliged to entertain such questions is beyond
me.

Bust me for laziness, because I won't check the archives either, but I recall that
it was Borges who said that his _students'_ favorite expression in English was
"cellar door." Could they have been reading Stein?

I noticed. I think. I've got to write this note quickly though and beat out
the lunchtime crowds at Filene's Basement.

In new england there is a mechanism in people that aims for the worst in
particular situations. For example, if it is cold and raw and ugly outside,
one would say to one's fellow, "well, at least it ain't snowing." Or, if
there is heavy snow and a tree falls on your house, one would say "well, at
least it didn't hit the truck." And so on.

So there is a coup in Congress--the sick fruition of an effort begun on
Inauguration Day 1992. Well, at least nobody's been shot yet.

Ken Starr, he "investigated" a Clinton real estate investement, and no one
particularly cared.
So "travelgate" came to pass, and no one was impressed.
Contributions to the Clinton campaign were scrutinzed but the public lacked
enthusiasm.
Legions of felt-up associates came forward but no one in power was so
shameless as to pretend they were interested in "protecting" women from
sexual harassment.
Now the leader of the free world, in covering his ass for screwing around,
is accused of perjury and will be tried for high crimes and treason.

This is all still pretty tame by Roman standards.

All public officials know well enough from this day forward not ever to
fuck with health care again; no socialization of any industry whatsoever.


The trouble is I have no compulsion to defend the guy.
The problem is I hate his enemies more than I hate him,
and I hate him a lot.
The gist of it is there is nothing one can do about it anyway.
I guess we'll get what we deserve by christmas anyway.
The interesting part is borne out of mandatory passivity.
The interesting part is free lessons in double-plus bad speak.
Tiberius was a sexual predator too.
Clinton is not fit to lace his sneakers.
The interesting part will begin once he's gone.


Thankfully I am a provincial and have few international associates to be
embarrassed before.

I'm with Jonathan--anyone who does this is incredibly rude. I can't even
imagine this sort of scene taking place. Do people really come up to your
lover after a reading, sipping their grocery store wine, and say, "So, you
really get off on having that birthmark on your ass caressed?"

It seems that a bigger problem would come about when a really ballsy
person insists on referring your work back your current lover when the
work in question was pointed toward a past lover...

I knew there was a reason I don't invite my ex-lovers to readings...Now
I'm paranoid. I'm hiding all my lover poems away in a box with a big
post-it (tm) note saying, "To be read after I'm halfway across the world."

Laura,

How archaic I think.  I mean all this talk about non-referentiality and
we still need to preface our words when reading and tell people "this is
not about you or me."  It's the confessional craze the idea that a
memoir really is or really is history or accurate or that there is a
fact or a real can you believe this bill of goods?

Rigaberta Menchu is being hounded by fact seeking academics who are hell
bent in rendering her story non-valid.  Thank goddess the nobel people
got the idea right in their retort to demands her prize be taken away in
saying, all writing embellishes, that was not the point.

I unfortunately get something similar quite often.  Whenever I read the
lines "you fucking me, me screaming," men inevitably come up to me all
smiles and invitations.  I wonder if anything I wrote was heard.  And
when I read my poem "She said she didn't think my ego was a problem"
I've had men following me saying "I just never thought about lesbians
that way before" and I think jeez I'm not a poet I'm a social worker.

in struggle,
Rachel

I think the reason for theory/manifestoes/whatnot, at least at the
beginning, was a need to distinguish oneself from the mainstream/what
has gone before. You wanted to maintain that you were different from all
that other junk, and then someone had the nerve to ask "in what way?"

                              ANNOUNCING

                             CYBERCULTURE

AN ELECTRONIC FORUM FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUBJECTIVITY
                     AND COMMUNITY IN CYBERSPACE

We are all dwelling in cyberspace, coursing through the wires, becoming
cyborg and becoming human, alone at the keyboard, together online. We are
subjects of a realm which offers new ways of envisioning Self and Oth-
er(s), and where a global cyberculture is in the process of creation.
Cyberculture is devoted to an examination of the new subjectivities and
collectivities that are emerging. We are interested in the cultural,
political, philosophical and psychological issues engendered, on all
levels of the social.

The Cyberculture email list is not a community-forming enterprise as such,
but a place to discuss culture and community online. The list will remain
focused on these topics; it will also be a clearing-house for work-in-pro-
gress, calls for papers, and so forth.

Some issues that may be relevant:

* the formation (or ad hoc re-constitution) and functioning of online
communities, such as Quake Clans or MUD/Usenet/e-mail groups;
* the place of the political in online communities and the functioning of
power online;
* work on sex, gender, race, sexual behaviour in relation to online (vir-
tual) subjectivity;
* the implications of symbolic and technological extensions of the human
(cyborg, android theory, etc.);
* financing the Net, the production of the Net consumer, and so forth;
* the social implications of computer interfaces and operating systems -
in other words, the role of the apparatus in online behavior and commun-
ity;
* and the interactions between online and offline culture (how social/
cultural ideas shape online and offline 'realities').

This will be a relatively open list - posts on all aspects of cyberculture
will be welcomed. We stress, however, that our intent is to explore these
issues in the broadest sense, within a focused, substantial discussion,
with a minimum of distraction.

One concern we hope to address is the way in which much theoretical work
on cyberspace to date reflects an exclusive, hegemonic bias, thus fore-
closing some of the most interesting and radical possibilities for the
development of cyberculture. We plan to challenge ourselves and the list
members to integrate issues of race, gender, class and multiculturalism in
our examinations and theories of cyberspace.

Indeed. And there has been some research in this area, involving cadences
in speech and comparing them between dialects and between different
languages, but I can't find it anywhere. The nearest I could get to it was
<URL:http://www.conknet.com/~mmagnus/>, which might have some sort of Radio
2 link to the topic - phonosemantics, although it doesn't beauty. Or truth,
come to that.

I've always had a partialness to "quark", although "yellowhammer" seems to
be cropping up a lot recently.

Subject:      poetry reading at the DC Arts Center (fwd)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        We hope you can join us on Sunday, December 20 at 3 p.m. at the DC
Arts Center (2438 18th St. in Adams Morgan, just below the corner of 18th
and Columbia) for a poetry reading by SHERRY BRENNAN and P. INMAN.

        SHERRY BRENNAN's chapbook TAKEN, published by D.C.'s primitive
publications, was one of the highlights of D.C. poetry publishing in 1997.
Last time she was here, she tore up a poem as she read it, and said
certain things over and over without ever repeating herself. Now she's
back again for another reading, and those of you who missed her
the first time have a chance to not make the same mistake again. Her work
has also appeared recently in CHAIN, MASS AVE, NO ROSES REVIEW, and
SITUATION.

        By his own admission, P. INMAN was once described as "a typical
language poet/unfeeling in small reviews." In books like RED SHIFT, VEIL,
and CRISS CROSS, Inman has invented a poetic language unlike any other,
where the lack of conventional referentiality has been replaced by a
shifting verbal landscape of fractured phrases and dislocating repetitions
that have no intention of getting you anywhere.


        We hope to see you there and for all festivities afterwards.

Baghdad's live now on TV, tracer bullets everywhere. They're going to
impeach the President. Saddam plays into the expected narrative - he
controls it. Derails the impeachment. The Republicans will call Saddam
a Liberal. Everyone fulfills everyone. In both senses, Everything is
All Over. "Bombs will hit the ground and people die," quote from the
news. Suddenly "incoming" is seen. "Some sort of decoy." "A few moments
ago some sort of impact with the ground." Saddam takes his turn at wri-
ting the story. The Republicans will take over. Clinton, branded, his
skin searing, smoking, turns his hands into buttons, the Y2K problem
coming early.

"Everything is full capacity."

_Stay tuned._

I hesitate to post this.  I wrote it earlier today--title and
all--thinking mostly of an odd state of semi-lucid semi-paralysis, and
thinking of this state in mainly "personal" terms.  Then I went to the gym
and got on the treadmill, with all the tvs tuned to the scene Alan has
described, the scene of waiting for the bombs to drop, and the poem began
to seem in some way "political."


The Drop

In some ways a limited state
of consciousness, as if

one were sitting in a
sparsely furnished room.

Some things are missing
from the room, things

one might want.  But
each object present

shines in a clear light.
This light comes slanting in

as if from a high window.
Even the swirling of motes in

its beams seems a dance of
precision and subtle logic.

The words stand out on
the page, big and few,

just as they did in the
school days of early youth.

Time unfolds slowly, in no
hurry.  It is almost impossible

to think of the future.
This liberation is both

disturbing and exhilarating.
There are things one is

supposed to do that will
not be done.  As always,

there are terrible truths
waiting.  The single

moment continues to expand,
stretching like a bubble,

reaching toward imponderable
dimensions.

One wonders, idly and without
great concern,

when it will burst.

OTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION From the Fellowship of Reconciliation

Please contact: the President (President@whitehouse.gov ), the
Vice-President (Vice.President@whitehouse.gov ), the Secretary of State
(secretary@state.gov ) and your Senators and Member of Congress and urge
them to support UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan to resolve the
Iraq
crisis. Also, please thank those members of Congress who made public
statements against the proposed bombing (Lynn Rivers/MI, John
Conyers/MI,
Cynthia McKinney/GA and others (General address is
http://www.house.gov/writerep/

Congressional Toll-Free numbers: Call during business hours. Ask the
switchboard operator for the name of the Representative or Senator you
want
to bug. Of course, you won't get your elected official, but a staff
member. It is a good idea to get the name of any staffer you establish
some rapport with so you can ask for her/him in future calls. Also,
there
is a Congressional web page which will give you information about each
Representative or Senator, http://www.capweb.net/directory.html.   The
toll-free numbers I have used with best success are (in order of
infrequency of busy signals):
800-504-0031
888-723-5246
800 522 6721
888-723-5846

Preface:
Here are some personal views of mine shoddily disguised as poetry. It's the
only way to sneak them onto the List. Consider Robert Duncan & a Tradition
hereby "mentioned." While keeping in mind that I can write this awful
drivel without fear of arrest or state violence (violence to me
individually), the idea that posting a poem to 666 hypothetical readers, or
protesting on the Boston Common later today, or calling a Congressperson,
is akin to pissing in the wind.



Why get angry about what one won t understand?
No sane person actually lives in Iraq.
It has taken only a quarter century
to apprehend Pinochet.
At least now the murders are almost Official.

So US began by bombing Baghdad one Wednesday.
On Thursday a vote to impeach had been slated.
Not thru the president only did we begin bombing
for no one in the House questions the act.
The right do so belongs to US.
And the bombing began well before Ramadan
(a compensatory holiday
for the heathen who lack christmas,
and for this convenient scheduling the NSC claim benignity,
a further token of our good will).

That the bombing coincides with impeachment proceedings brings
media attention to the "highly suspicious" timing of the attack,
but no one--not a single voice
with the capacity to reach large numbers
(that is, the "liberal" media)--
will question the god-given right
of US to bomb Baghdad.

The major paper in Boston said
"Saddam's response was a defiant call to arms"
as if defiance constituted defending oneself
against what the major paper in Boston called
"waves of cruise missiles and bombers"
because the US has made it plain for half a century
that any attempt to repel US attacks
is an act of intolerable rebellion.

The main point--ignore 'em all and tear down the capitalist system. (Yes:
i know it takes a while;  i'm working on it!!) A coup within the
republicrat machine, one right-wing against the other right-wing, gets my
blood up even less than it does Daniel's.

This approach has the lovely side benefit that you don't have to pay
attention (with any degree of personal investment) to Starr, clinton, the
much missed Newt etcccc.

Of course when someone launches a war to get around impeachment, all bets
are off....

But it does illustrate that the existing system is among the most barbaric
and irrational of all options...

        Tosh's question, which hardly seems worth answering, if he has to
ask: for waging an illegal war. Congress has to declare war. True, they
never declared war on Vietnam, and it's okay with me if retroactively JFK,
LBJ and Nixon are impeached for the same crime.(The Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution was a means to sneak around the constitutional requirement).
And since Congress appears to support this illegal war, impeach them, too.

Americans make so much of the Constitution--yet Representatives flout it at
will.

Even the to-me dubious authority to wage war of the United Nations has been
flouted this time. And I am ashamed of Britain that they permit their
government and armed forces to murder Iraqis to save Bill Clinton's skin.
If you know any history, here's another poem:

  THE WAR OF JENKIN'S EAR
  THE WAR OF CLINTON'S ASS

At least a month ago I was only half joking that Clinton would bomb Iraq
in time for the impeachment vote, and people who follow Middle East events
were quite prepared for the eventuality.  The fact that he returned from
Israel/Palestine with the Palestinians once again making concessions and
Netanyahu once again raising new demands to stall the "peace process" and
then goes on to launch war against Iraq -- it's all too stupendous to
grasp.  Stop the war/stop the impeachment: the coup is getting more and
more complex.  Have you ever seen so many Republicans object to bombing
anyone, much less Iraq?  All of this connects to issues of poetics: people
were discussing referentiality and nonsense before, and I would
suggest that recent political discourse has gone way beyond Jabberwocky.

CALL FOR FLOODNET ACTION
FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
VITRUAL SIT-IN ON
THE WHITE HOUSE WEB SITE

Friday, December 18, 1998

FROM 10:00 AM TO 4:00 PM
(Washington D.C. TIME)

FROM 4:00 PM TO 10:00 PM
(GMT- GREENWICH MEAN TIME)

*******************************
We oppose the U.S. military attack on Iraq and believe that
the timing of this assault is designed to detract attention
from President Clinton's impending impeachment hearing
in Congress.

We do not accept the logic of the White House and the Pentagon
that Iraq poses a national security threat. If any country is guilty
of harboring weapons of mass destruction it is the United States.

We know that the U.S. government views the Middle East as a
strategic area because, in part, it is an oil rich region. And we
know the United States consistently uses the veil of "national
security" as a means to pursue and justify its agenda of global
economic domination.

We support the skeptical and angry views of the Russian,
Chinese, and Iraqi ambassadors to the United Nations Security
Council who strongly voiced their opposition to U.S. and U.K.
aggression against Iraq.

We are saddened by the images on CNN of the innocent
people who were injured in the first hours of the aerial
bombardment. Moreover, we are aware that these victims are
just a few of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have
either died or suffered greatly since the first Gulf War in
1991 and under U.S. backed sanctions that have existed
since then.

We support the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. We support
the efforts of international human rights organizations,
groups  like Friendship Across Frontiers, and other sectors of
international civil society who have been
working for years to help the Iraqi people.

We do not support Saddam Hussein but we believe
it is not our right as Americans to go beyond merely having
opinion. It is up to the Iraqi people,
and others in the Arab world, to remove Saddam Hussein
from office, if that is their desire and will.

We believe the age of imperialism should come to an end.
It is quite telling that the imperial power of the 19th century,
Great Britain, and the imperial power of the 20th century,
the United States, have joined forces alone as we enter the
21st century.

In one instance, we agree with a characterization of the
United States, made by Iraqi leaders. The history of U.S.
military and intelligence intervention, both covert and overt,
in Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and domestically
within sovereign Native American territory, is enough evidence
to support the classification of this country as an Evil
Empire.

We support all efforts to denounce, oppose, protest, and
resist the joint U.S.-U.K assault on Iraq, both domestically
within the United States and England, in other European
countries, in Middle Eastern countries, and
throughout the world.

We recognize that resistance to the current bombardment
of Iraq, and resistance to all future war, will take place in
two spheres. One is on the ground, in the streets, in offices,
in universities, in factories -  in real spaces. The other is
on the Net, in what the Pentagon now calls "battlespace.=94
And we support the development and practice of joint
virtual-real actions of resistance.

We do not believe that only nation-states have the
legitimate authority to engage in war and aggression.
And we see cyberspace as a means for
non-state political actors to enter present and future
arenas of conflict, and to do so across international borders.

We do not know how long the current U.S.-U.K. aerial assault
on Iraq will last. Indications are that it will be short-lived.
It may therefore not be an appropriate or strategic moment
to attempt to inspire, coordinate, and sustain a campaign
of virtual-real actions of resistance.

We do feel, however, compelled to take some action.
And therefore we will use FloodNet, the same tool
we have been using against web sites of the Mexican
government, to now make a symbolic gesture of our
opposition to the current assault on Iraq.

We therefore urge all people of good conscience
who have the clarity of mind to oppose these aerial
assaults to join us in a ongoing, nonviolent,
virtual sit-in on the White House web site.
We urge you to join us in a FloodNet  Action
for Peace in the Middle East.

Dan -- do you think what we deserve is a govt. where the strongest branch
by far is congress, which seems likely if impeachment passes in the
house, irregardless of what happens in the Senate. The ramifications of
impeachment seem densely layered & scary, despite Clinton's lunacy.

I noticed. I think. I've got to write this note quickly though and beat
out
the lunchtime crowds at Filene's Basement.

In new england there is a mechanism in people that aims for the worst in
particular situations. For example, if it is cold and raw and ugly
outside,
one would say to one's fellow, "well, at least it ain't snowing." Or, if
there is heavy snow and a tree falls on your house, one would say "well,
at
least it didn't hit the truck." And so on.

So there is a coup in Congress--the sick fruition of an effort begun on
Inauguration Day 1992. Well, at least nobody's been shot yet.

Ken Starr, he "investigated" a Clinton real estate investement, and no one
particularly cared.
So "travelgate" came to pass, and no one was impressed.
Contributions to the Clinton campaign were scrutinzed but the public
lacked
enthusiasm.
Legions of felt-up associates came forward but no one in power was so
shameless as to pretend they were interested in "protecting" women from
sexual harassment.
Now the leader of the free world, in covering his ass for screwing around,
is accused of perjury and will be tried for high crimes and treason.

This is all still pretty tame by Roman standards.

All public officials know well enough from this day forward not ever to
fuck with health care again; no socialization of any industry whatsoever.


The trouble is I have no compulsion to defend the guy.
The problem is I hate his enemies more than I hate him,
and I hate him a lot.
The gist of it is there is nothing one can do about it anyway.
I guess we'll get what we deserve by christmas anyway.
The interesting part is borne out of mandatory passivity.
The interesting part is free lessons in double-plus bad speak.
Tiberius was a sexual predator too.
Clinton is not fit to lace his sneakers.
The interesting part will begin once he's gone.


Thankfully I am a provincial and have few international associates to be
embarrassed before.

Anselm,
(is this Anselm's note?)

Impeachment in the House won't necessarily make the House the strongest
branch.
The strongest branch of government over the past couple of years has been
the Office of Independent Counsel, a new branch Grafted by the House to
Propagate the demise of the Executive branch.

And that House branch will likely experience a mighty Shaking when the next
election rolls around.

By "deserve" I don't necessarily mean the result Stemming from the last few
weeks of impeachment proceedings. I mean it will be laid out for us, like
an Xmas present under the Tree (and timely too), given by people who make
decisions.

Even so-called conservatives have conceded that polls exist which show 2/3
of the citizenry do not want the President impeached. But what people want
is not at issue. I wonder if the division of votes will be downplayed or
spotlighted in the press (i.e., ALL republicans FOR impeachment, ALL
democrats and the single rep. who is neither D or R AGAINST). My bet is it
will be highlighted, and if nothing happens (i.e., a riot) it will be drawn
out.

The last time this country had a bona fide impeachment, everyone was living
in log cabins. (So the history books tell us.) I hope Clinton sticks it
out. I hope he sits thru trial in the Senate and spills his entire bowl of
beans.

By "deserve" I mean a disavowal of faith in the system, a repugnance for
the scope of political discourse in the country (comprising 10 degrees of a
circle, if that), an impatience that less than half those eligible bother
to vote, etc etc etc

Would there be such a clamor today over the bombing of Baghdad if there
were not impeachment proceedings going on? I think not.

joe,

is the argument, then, that theorizing one's poetics has now become so de
rigeur that many such theorizations are not urgent, not compelling, and
that the essay that collapses theory-poetry distinctions offers (or at
least can offer, as in bromige's case) a more urgent and compelling
statement of poetics?  (bear with me as i conflate bernstein, perloff, and
amato, and please draw distinctions where you see fit...)

thanks,
t.

Okay, I know I often stick my steel-toed Doc Marten boot in my mouth when
I try to fix Latin, but I'm pretty confident about this one. The above
subject line should just be "Exit Gaddis," as only one of him, the one and
only, passed on to glory. If more than one person leaves the stage at the
same time, it's "exeunt," plural, and if everybody splits, "exeunt omnes,"
everyone's leaving.

*** Russia may ask Lewinsky for help

MOSCOW (AP) - Russian legislators considered a motion Thursday
appealing to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the American attack on
Iraq. "The State Duma appeals to Ms. Lewinsky to undertake
corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,"
said the motion by nationalist lawmaker Alexander Filatov. Lawmakers
in the Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, considered including
the motion in a broader resolution denouncing the attack on Iraq. But
seeking to speed up passage of the resolution, they approved it later
Thursday without any additions. There was no separate vote on the
Lewinsky amendment. See

*** Heinz touts benefits of ketchup

NEW YORK (AP) - Here's a new reason to pour ketchup on your next
burger: It may help reduce your risk of cancer. With anemic growth in
ketchup sales, the king of ketchup - Pittsburgh, Pa.-based HJ Heinz
Co. - is unfurling a marketing campaign to tout the health benefits
of the processed tomato concoction. Next month Heinz will join the
growing number of food companies touting the health benefits of their
products when it launches an ad campaign to show that its ketchup
contains lycopene, an antioxidant which has been linked to reducing
certain cancers. The print ads are scheduled for runs in The New York
Times Sunday Magazine, USA Today, Health magazine and Prevention. See

*** Man held in piranha food choking

GLENDORA, Calif. (AP) - A 26-year-old man was arrested after
allegedly choking his mother because she didn't buy food for his two
pet piranhas. Nathan Ricketts was being held Wednesday on suspicion
of battery and possession of drug paraphernalia, Officer John Bur
said. Bail was set at $100,000. "He choked her almost into
unconsciousness," Bur said. Officers also confiscated two 7-inch-long
piranhas that Ricketts had brought into the house earlier this week
and placed in a 30-gallon aquarium. He refused to tell officers where
he got the bloodthirsty South American fish, which are illegal to
own. Wildlife officials ordered the fish destroyed, Bur said. ###

... so you see, the question/dilemma is only whether the Chief Executive
Weasel craftily staged an attack to divert attention from proceedings on
Capitol Hill. It's the timing, the timing.

... the question must never be framed around whether U.S. has the right to
bomb a city we've been starving for 7 years. That we may attack anyone
(provided they are not strong enough to put up a fight) at any time is
unquestionable.



              Poll: Americans support bombing of Iraq

              WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans overwhelmingly support President
Clinton's
              decision to order air strikes against Iraq, according to
three polls released today.

              About three-quarters of adults said they backed the action,
polls taken by CBS,
              ABC and NBC showed.

              About 60 percent in the NBC poll said Clinton's action was
warranted, while just
              over one in four Americans said they thought the military
action was timed to
              delay impeachment proceedings that had been scheduled to
begin today. House
              action on that front has been postponed indefinitely.

              So far, the decision to take action against Iraq has not
changed public opinion
              about impeachment. In the ABC poll, 40 percent said the House
should impeach
              the president, while 58 percent said he should not be
impeached. Those numbers
              are essentially unchanged from last week.

              All three polls were conducted Wednesday night. ABC
interviewed 510 people and
              NBC polled 503. Both polls error margins plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.

              The CBS poll was based on 413 people and had a margin of
error of plus or minus
              5 percentage points.

Has anybody else noticed how much the word "degrade" is being used in
reference to the attacks on Iraq?  It seems that with each major event
there is a word or phrase that somehow describes the thought-form or
psychic locale of the whole operation.

The whole Clinton affair began with "perjury" and "private life", but it
seems ironic that in the definition of "degrade" there is mention of
reducing in rank, which is at the heart of the impeachment efforts.

Does anybody recall what were some of the other "keywords" surrounding
Bush's desert storm?

--trace--

degrade \De*grade"\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Degraded; p. pr. &
   vb. n. Degrading.] [F. d['e]grader, LL. degradare, fr. L.
   de- + gradus step, degree. See Grade, and cf. Degree.]
   1. To reduce from a higher to a lower rank or degree; to
      lower in rank; to deprive of office or dignity; to strip
      of honors; as, to degrade a nobleman, or a general
      officer.

I realize that this is a topic that everyond is talking about.
This is not a water cooler. While I appreciate creative and/or critical
responses to world politics, the possibilities of using this list for
social and political organizing, this here is the kind of use of this
list that I personally find to be inappropriate. The bombing of Iraq and
the surreal political landscape surrounding it requires more than
mindless chitchat.

Past Time - from _ Drums at New Brighton



We drove along the lanes that Wordsworth walked
Past lakes whipped into white tipped waves,
Past fields over which he strode for love,
Past gift shops, flower shops, tea shops.
Past bookshops selling the collected works.
Past his home, his other home and hers.

Then to Dove Cottage and the obligatory tour,
To see the things he lived with,
To hear the sound of creaking beams he heard.
To smell the plaster, feel the wooden floor.
To see a pen he wrote with
And a letter written at this desk.

But in it all no sign of him
Just spores left in his wake
He has gone, heaved anchor sailed off
To find Arcadia.

Arrived home past nine,
Past time collating memories.
Then found him lurking in a poem.


Leasow Beach - From _Drums At New Brighton_


Wings frozen in rigor flight
Soaring into death
Elegance hidden by black tar
The silent gull lies on the sand

Once it lay on the thermals of the world
Uplifted by invisible hands
Shaping the air with each wing sweep
As it sculled across the sky

But now encased in death
Its sightless eyes, and beak, wide
Its final shriek locked in a swollen throat
It lies stiff and cold on Leasow Beach

We came, as we often do,  to find shells,
See the pool life,  rest our feet on drying sand
Instead, we found the gull,
A metaphor mummified by waist.

 It didn't save Bush's ass when he bombed Iraq. Do you really think it will
stop Clinton from being impeached by him (US) r bombing Iraq.  I am sorry,
but I feel you are wrong on these two points above.  The Iraq issue is
different from the current Impeachment issue.

David:

The same act of congress that established the CIA also empowered the
President to issue National Security Decision Directives, basically
granting dictatorial powers to the Presidentto initiate military actions
without Congressional approval for, I think, 60 days. Clinton doesn't
seem to have issued such a directive in this case, but he does have the
authority to do so. To characterize his actions, however repellent, as
"illegal" doesn't wash. Vietnam, however, clearly fell under the
definition of "illegal."

I find more disturbing the eagerness to impute the motivation for the
present carnage to a Clintonian oilspray-from-the-rear-bumper "Thunder
Road" attempt to sabotage the impeachment process. Since when did
cincidence translate automatically to cause? Didn't Hume [not to mdention
Jung] disabuse us of this nonsense? _Something_ has to work for the guy:
"Slick Wilie odomized by the Fortuitous"? Poetic Justice with a smile?

I'd rather think so than believe that Clinton -- more right on than any
president in recent memory -- would act so heinously. He really seems to
believe he didn't perjure himself ["what 'is' is," &c]; why not grant him
the benefit of [the? his?] doubt? The law does...

The new Speaker's boffed a billion bimbos, evidently, BUT "uh, gee... no
one ever asked me about it under oath" [see _asshole_ in the dictionary
for his 8 x 10]. That turd wants to weasel on a technicality, but won't
let Bill? "Gentlemen, start your engines."

AMERIKA {not Clinton -- whaddya think? one gut runs this juggernaut?] has
discovered Victor Frankenstein's Social Security card in its wallet and
-- after vain [and vainglorious] attempts to remonstrate [don'tcha love
that word?] with The Creature -- finds itself a galley slave in a trireme
[not kayaking solo] hoping to ram Saddam's Ghost Armada.

"Why Impeach Clinton?" Duh: so Gore can't get two terms!

Joel,
I couldn't disagree with you more.  I was mighty relieved when I found
people trying to squeeze out a somewhat coherent response to U.S./U.K.
bombing of Iraq.  I also have a lot of respect for the people who posted
poems to the list today.  You know, I have only ever seen the water cooler
situation you disparage in movies. Mindless chitchat? How weird it would
have been today if no-one attempted to lurch round their great awkward
and inadequate craft to at least get in their sights the news of today.
Expletives come easy to me when I think of your post.  I will desist.
Mairead

Tosh is in agreement with 3/4 of the U.S. population, to whom it is not at
all obvious that Clinton ordered these attacks AT THIS TIME as a
diversionary and complicating tactic to delay/avoid impeachment. I suppose
I am one of those the media has already characterized as *cynical* on this
score--although to me it seems more *cynical* of Clinton to kill Iraqis at
this time. I'm with Trent Lott (the Trent of yesterday, before he'd read
the latest polls).

I am reminded of the years in Berkeley in the late 60's, when Berkeley was
so much in the news. It appeared to us-all that the war in Vietnam MUST
come to a halt very soon--that our protests, which were getting so much ink
and so much tv exposure, must somehow spread thru the nation as a whole.
How mistaken!

No longer resident in Berkeley, I nonetheless listen to its PBS station,
KPFA, a great deal, and particularly during such crises as this one. After
being all day long tuned-in to speaker after speaker who shares my views, I
forget that many people are denied any contact with radical radio (I have
no idea how that liberal station what's it's name is handling this issue).
One speaker today, an expert on Middle East affairs, whose name I regret I
didnt catch, was saying "if you believe there is no connection between
impeachment and bombing Iraq, you believe that Santa is coming down the
chimney next week and that the fairy came and took your tooth away." I
grant you that this was not the reasoned part of his argument. For the
reason that I live in a cocoon of radical truth, Tosh's question 'Why
impeach Clinton?" [for illegal airstrikes on the civilian population of
another sovereign nation] struck me as absurd. I apologize. I have a nose
for this kind of political jiggery-pokery, and knew from the start that the
Tonkin Gulf Incident was being manufactured in order to widen the war. This
turned out to be true--many years later. But perhaps the problem is that I
have insufficient respect for authority, which, after all, by its very
nature, knows best.

I will add that the naivite of even educated Americans, when it comes to
foreign policy, fills me with dismay. Here's some more, but different,
naivite:

 I AS IN IMAGINE

 I as in America
 I as in Iraq
 I as in East Timor
 I as in Indonesia
 I as in India
 I as in Pakistan
 I as in Russia
 I as in China
 I as in Libya
 I as in Israeli
 I as in Jordanian

need I go on? An illegal++ airstrike is murder, is it not? An unsanctioned
killing of...of your mother, Tosh, or your wife, or your child. Or mine. I
as in Imagine. Maybe because as a child I was bombed (legally, however) by
the Germans, I find it impossible to distance myself when even dark-skinned
people are being burned and blasted apart. Unfortunately for the rest of
the world, the USA has not been subject to aerial blitzkrieg.

Joel, I hope that this is not one of those "water-cooler" posts you had in
mind. IMHO, what happens to the language of truth during such international
"negotiations" has a strong connection with poetry and poetics. It feels
that w/o Rachel Levinsky and Alan Sondheim, to mention just two, we would
be fiddling while Rome burns. Or I mean Baghdad. True, I can't imagine
Samuel Beckett posting to the List in protest against American foreign
policy, for there seems little to be done, and he was often the first to
notice when such was the case. Perhaps mine is a pointless sounding-off,
and if so, I apologize again.

A d even if the commander-in-chief can be taken at his word,I dont know how
you locate half-a-glass of anthrax--enough for us all--with even ten
thousand Cruise missiles. Oowww! Damn, but it hurts to be burned!

Happy Ramadhan. David


++ thanks, Dan Zimmerman, for the qualification re Clinton not needing

Joel,

If this is the kind of frontchannel list "moderation" thought necessary by
the team of list "moderators," I must say that I prefer the old method:
Deletion.  Just delete the posts that don't pass your obviously high
standards of what constitutes Non-mindless chatter [maybe all the posts
having to do with Mindless Commerce and Careerist Buttkiss, for instance].

Rather than posting your attempts at moderation in a beery swagger (had
you been drinking?), why don't you just abandon your job altogether: you
obviously find the work burdensome, judging by this and the last few
frontchannels to your Fellow Cop, Charles Bernstein.

You and Bernstein can't seem to decide between the Invisible Hand and the
Heavy Hand:  "Ahh, do I delete Henry's posts or just attack him as a
moron?"  "Do I delete this new guy's post or just slur a paragraph about
mindlessness?"

You keep going this way, you two, and this list is going to become as
boring as CB's poetry. And that's saying something.  Loosen up, Kuszai:
you've got the ring of the Office Dead in your voice.  Get thee to the
MLA, boy: that'll put some spring in your step.

Your comment to D was frankly rather piggish, far more "mindless"  and
indeed more offensive to my sensibility than David's emotive outburst. The
US is bombing Iraqis again and you want to diddle about what's an
appropriate comment?  If YOU can make one, post it.

I  wish to apologize for the lack of imagination in my insults to joel and
charles this morning: I was at the christmas sherry [Savory & James,
Manzanilla {imported}] and had just switched to some port when I wrote
that; my liver and pancreas hadn't yet adjusted, sending my brain into a
hypoglycemic reeling [any port in a storm]; will try in future to show the
muse into my malice. gaga

Came across a list of words voted most agreeable to the British ear in a
1980 _Sunday Times_ poll.
1)melody
1)velvet
3)gossamer
3)crystal
4)autumn
5)peace
6)tranquil
7)twilight
8)murmur
10)caress
10)mellifluous
10)whisper

No carcenoma!
Though, given recent events,
i'd be glad to in a twilight hour,
whisper it repeatedly, with a melody, into the
ears of Mr's Clinto & Blair.

well my email system went down when we started bombing iraq, go figure...

i was relieved to see around here responses/reactions to this sad event,
b/c this is one of the places where i hang out and i like to think you
poets and poetry-inclined are all concerned citizens...

tom o, from that (now (three day) old) thread:  yeah, that's about right,
your articulation of things...

----

i don't think clinton should be impeached, and i don't think we should be
bombing iraq... so i surely don't think we should be bombing iraq now, and
i don't think clinton should be impeached now... as kass would say, lots of
political hay being made on all sides of this issue, even as blood is
spilled "over there"...

and that said:  i *do* believe we (the planet earth and its tribal
communities) need to devise some sort of international mechanism to remove
tyrants (ok?) from "office" (we need international mechanisms for a LOT of
things, incl. the environment)... i wish i had all the answers, but i'm
positive that the answer is *not* to claim merely that all nations have a
sovereign right to kill and torture their own citizens to their leaders'
content---which thereby leaves us with the relative luxury of retreating
into an apparently non-interventionist stance (while in actuality helping
to install puppet regimes ad nauseum)...  which is to say, i don't hold for
isolationism, real or imagined... personally, i think that a military
intervention into iraq using (de facto internationally constituted) ground
troups---whose mission was, first and foremost, to remove hussein---would
result in many fewer civilian casualties (but of course more military
losses on "our" side), and would result in less damage to the iraqi
infrastructure, which itself is causing such misery in that poor country...
though obviously there's no "perfect" solution in this far-from-perfect
world...

my two bits' worth, from my swivel chair...

best,

joe

While agreeing with Joel (and always suspicious of the tendency of my own
political ventings to affirm my sense of righteousness and delusion of
having taken action), it was Alan Sondheim's early note that alerted me
(and perhaps others) to the bombing, for which I am grateful.  I would not
otherwise have known until the next morning.

There is always the issue of language and image.  Technocratic gloating in
the media is particularly offensive here.  But scenes from Baghdad remind
us that the people our bombs are killing are indeed human.

EVERY MORNING AFTER KILLING
THOUSANDS OF ANGELS

I

I read a boy's poem called
"Every Morning After Killing Thousands of Angels"
I forget the poem, but the title won't leave me
I drink some coffee
read a paper read by millions
all the misery
all the destruction in the world
herded into headlines and catch phrases
the only part I trust
is the financial page
a completely blank space governed
by the mechanics of capital and pure speculation

2

That boy's mornings
and my mornings--
how are they different?

3

But the boy can see the angels' faces

4

What do you do
after you kill them?

I go out walking

Where?

To a river with a very big bridge over it

Every morning?

Every morning
while my hands are still bloody

5

I can't kill thousands of angels
but I walk  a dry path to the beach
the hot sky's still filled
with sweating typhoon clouds
the sea's a later color
fall is not summer at the horizon
narrow streams run through
spaces silted with darkness
weak-looking capillaries float on my thin hands:
no place to anchor a big bridge

6

Noon at this end of the bridge
everything shines
shirt buttons
decayed tooth
an air rifle
broken sunglass lens
pink shells
smells of seaweed
river water mixing with the sea
sand
and
as far
as my footprints

7

It's my turn now
I'll tell you about the world
at the far end of the bridge
the shadow world
things and concepts totally shadow
shadows feeding on shadows
spreading, radiating like cancer cells
decomposing, radiating like cancer cells
decomposing organs and drowned bodies
green thought swelling and distending
medieval markets surging with merchants and prostitutes and
         monks
cats, sheep, hogs, horses, cows
every kind of meat on the butcher shop hooks
but no blood anywhere

8

So I can't see the bridge
unless I kill thousands of angels?

9

What sight excites me most sexually?
the bridge has disappeared
a riderless black horse
crosses the world of light
slowly, toward the shadow world
but exhausted, it falls
crying animal tears but not rotting
gleaming directly to bone
pure white bone
and then to earth
and then
dawn comes
I've got to go out and live
after killing
killing thousands of angels

--RYUICHI TAMURA
Translated from the Japanese by Christopher Drake

Japan (b. 1923)

Ryuichi Tamura was born in Otsuka, a suburb of Tokyo, and he grew up in the
black room of a restaurant run by his mother.  This was during an era of
natural disasters, economic hardship, and militarism in Japan.  In an
effort, he said, to "break away from the conservativism and anachronism" of
his culture, he began writing self-consciously modernist poems in school
and fell in with a group of poets who looked to T.S. Eliot's work for
inspiration.  He studied at Meiji University but before graduation was
drafted into the navy during the last two years of WWII.  In postwar Tokyo
writers questioned all the old values. "We were glad to be the living
dead," he has said of that time, "with nothing to lose.  We wanted to
question the basic principles behind an industrial society based on war and
imperialism,  I tried to make my poems into holes or windows that would let
me see through the indefinable spiritual waste as well as the obvious
spiritual destruction."  Since that time Tamura has continued to explore
alternatives to the industrialized mechanisms of contemporary life.

ELEGY WITH CROSSHAIRS


Science is visiting the Middle East, today;
the dollar is the new political dance craze people
do in flames. The planes are invisible.
A child licks fat snowflakes out of air, here.
Were this the tropics, I could--perhaps--scrawl
my scent on the street
SOS. Instead the man who found my wallet
eats nothing, in Mexico.
I think of my passport in the landfill and nod.
Recursive viral advertisements!
like a trace poison leaked worldwide--
a man running back and forth in a field
like a crazy wide receiver; a tap drip;
a courtyard of exploding pigeons.
Someone puts their love in singles
and another in empties.
The computers are drowning in numbers.
I hate surrealism, they say, frothing.
They think, logically, that it's a mutilation
of a mutilation, a logarithm
bending away from the earth's kiss.
The computers drown in men's fingers.
In their lightning speech, wildly dialing,
the word for disease means cure,
to touch a scalpel to a star is
flower. It's not surreal. It's
power. It's a bomb.

Gabe, I hope we can meet someday. I hope you and others who have flamed
me are as courageous in person as you are virtually. If it was up to me,
I would have deleted you a long time ago. But, since I don't get to do
what you want, and you do, I have decided to leave the list. I'm not
trying to be dramatic. This list has been a lifeline for me and leaving
it is not easy. I appreciated Alan's comments on the bombing and the
poetry and critical discourse swirling around it. On the other hand, I
do think I was pretty specific about what I objected to. I also noted
that I was "personally" opposed to that sort of thing. So, with this in
mind, I wish you all well.

as i've said, i just read through the poetix posts this morning... seems to
me joel was responding specifically to

>MAN........don't you see that THIS IS THE FUCKING PROBLEM?

(by way of example)

i don't see joel as the fucking problem... which is not to say i see the
above as the fucking problem, either, or even that i see "mindless
chitchat" as the fucking problem... i think one fucking problem is when
discussion heats up to the point of sending little electronic bombs out
across the ether... and i thought joel was trying to say (whatever you make
of what he said or how he said it) that perhaps it would behoove us not to
be too impetuous, that what we don't need, esp. at this moment in
historical time, is to amp up our email to the status of weaponry,
defensive or offensive, in order to generate more adversarial exchange...
albeit it's true that the events of the past few days are bound to produce
just that...

come to think of it, maybe many of us *do* need to spend more time at the
water cooler... hey, i'm on my way, gonna go soak my head, b/c i can't
believe what's happening on the house floor, and in the skies over iraq,
and---

An absolute shit for sure. Your insults are unacceptable. Your apologies

When I asked the question "Why impeach Clinton?" I was responding to
David's one sentence/poem "Impeach Clinton."  At the time I didn't know if
he was responding to the Iraq crisis or the ongoing debate in Washington
about Clinton's sexual activity.  I wasn't sure what David was talking
about - so the question was very simple.  Impeach him for what?  And again,
these are two different issues.  If you want to impeach him for attacking
Iraq - that is one issue.  If you want to impeach him for lying under oath
about his sex habits - that's another issue.  I wasn't clear in regards to
what David was responding to

Actually a friend of mine - a painter from Iraq, his brother died in Iraq
due to the fact that he couldn't get medical aid due to the restrictions
placed by the U.S. as well as other Western countries.  So yes, I am
touched by any forms of violence committed - where ever it is happening in
Europe, Asia, or down the street from me.  I think ANY airstrike is murder
- because someone (almost always) innocent gets killed.

The attack on Iraq was expected for some time -- particularly that it
would occur before Ramadan (a perverse nod towards religious propriety and
the fact that the Muslim world would be even more enraged if the bombing
was done during the holy month). US policy has been directed towards
"containment" of Iraq (and Iran) for some time. There is no expectation
(and possibly no real desire) to overthrow Saddam Hussein, simply because
there are no compliant "good" dictators to take his place.  Bombings and
further aggression have been on the agenda for years.  It's quite likely
that if there was a Republican president in office now exactly the same
policy would be carried out -- since there is no substantial difference in
policy regarding protecting "our" oil between the two parties.  Clinton's
bombing MAY be timed to coordinate with the impeachment crisis (although,
keep in mind, the machinery has been in  place for nearly a month) but the
bombing policy has not been invented for domestic political purposes.  I
say this in response to David Bromige's understandable rage -- but the
fact is that Clinton is not being impeached for war crimes but for sex
crimes, and while the rightwing impeachment coup MAY have serious
implications for foreign policy, it certainly has serious implications for
domestic policy, the "culture wars," the rise of the Christian right, etc.
(which in turn may create even more dangerous foreing policies, i.e. the
return of "Armageddon" mentality to the White House).

I just had dinner with an Egyptian novelist last night who remarked on the
strangely untenable positions so many people are being put in: he doesn't
like Saddam Hussein, but he is no friend of Clinton; he objects to the
bombing, but the opposition is dominated by Islamic radicals that he can
have nothing to do with -- the contraries go on.  Same here: Stop the
bombing -- and stop THIS impeachment.  As untenable as such a
contradictory position may seem.

Events swamp poetics; poetics are shaped by "smart" bombs -- so I think
it's appropriate to discuss this here.  Without insults.

Goodbye.  I'm sorry you're leaving, Joel.

I still rather naively want to see this list as something of a team (albeit
not one with a specific goal), and though I don't know Eliza and Gabe and
George and Rachel and many others and I do know Karen and Joe and David and
Juliana and many others, I value (or valued, if they're already gone from
the list) all their presences here, even if the team is sometimes rather
dysfunctional (I've never been on one that wasn't, and I've been on some
that coming through aspects of the dysfunction made them stronger). I do
know Joel and value his presence here as well as his presence with me in
other aspects of our work in poetry and poetics.

Thank you, Joel, for all you have given to this list -- your hard work,
your good counsel, your honesty, your care.

Dammit, dammit, dammit.  Don't you listers who are flaming Joel &
Charles realize what an easy position you're in, and what a difficult
one they're in?  How dare you persecute them for trying to handle as
best and as humanly as possible a job like theirs?  Especially if, like
me, you've only been with the list, say, 1/10th (me, about 1/100th) of
the time they have?  And yes, I DO think the length of the time
commitment they've made deserves your respect.  Flamers have made it
nigh impossible for Joel or Charles to post their opinions the way the
rest of us can.  It's like there's a fucking e-paparazzi out there just
waiting for C's & J's posts to appear in order to morph them into
national-enquirer level post-scandals.  Why would you do this to a
person?  Why would you do this to a person?

When I was a closeted, confused, bitter high school student I made quite
a reputation on malicious jokes, song parodies, etc.  I was excellent at
it, far more excellent than I have been at anything since.  It's FUN to
be a quick-draw, brilliantly biting, genius hurter of people.  Having
spent my time that way is my only enduring regret.
So yes, I understand that you're having a lot of FUN with Charles &
Joel.  I know how seductive that is; I know the thrill of crafting the
perfect put-down.  But please, *please* stop it.  Stop having fun &
start talking about poetics.  Maybe that could be fun, too.  Probably
not as-instantly gratifying fun, I'll grant that.  It's work.

Gabriel, you, for ex., I know, have a kid.  I do not think you'll
appreciate the jest if the kid comes home one day after having been
verbally brutalized as much as Joel & Charles have been by you.  You'll
probably want to kick the bully's ass.

I don't want to kick anyone's ass or to kick anyone off the list.  But I
feel physically sick when I think of Joel leaving.  He has given, and
continues to go out of his way to give, me reasons to post & feel
welcome here.  Whether or not you've felt, as I have, that Joel is a
generous, hardworking, fair & concerned person, you at least, I hope,
will agree that *Joel is a person*.  Nothing justifies the consistent
thrashings you've given to a fellow person.  In the same way that
nothing justifies the U.S.'s dropping bombs on Iraqi people.  With the
latter, we can only hope that our voices & vigils will make a
difference.  With the former, you making a difference is as easy as
thinking before you post, and remembering there's a person (or 666
people) on the other side of that post.  Stop it; just stop it.

Joel hopes he can meet Gabe someday.  I hope I can meet Joel someday, to
tell & show him in person how much his work, outreach, & thoughtfulness
have meant to me and, I'd be willing to bet, the majority of subscribers
to this list.

Joel, I'm sorry.

I watched some of the interminable hyperbolic impeachment debate at the gym
& came home & had a call from an elderly friend who remarked on how
dysfunctional one can get over the holidays & now I've read Charles'
measured post regarding the recent rather awful drama of the list, and it
seems obvious that even though we have facility with words, sometimes it's
best to just bite one's tongue. A certain honor in living with one's
emotions rather than blurting them all over.

I hope everyone has as peaceful a holiday as possible.

  Dear Joe Amato---
    sometimes aphorisms and koans are valuable little "bombs"
    (one would think those who value the "fragment"
     and think Bruce Andrews is just the bees' knees
     would appreciate such little "bombs" as you call them)

 I mean this particular post was posted by somebody who--I think--
 had largely been silent before. And despite whatever good intentions
 might be attributed to JK, it does seem there was an attempt to nip
 in the bud somebody who was trying to actually bring the discussion
 of the Iraq crisis to a more meta-level than Bouchard's righteousness
 (I'm not taking sides on this issue right now--
  i.e. is there a difference between hating and hating the haters?)

 Anyway, I'll shut up now....coz I gotta drink some water
  and there's no cooler but a sink........

I agree with this...at least up to a point.  So let me briefly mention:  i
have great respect for many of the posts expressing outrage, pain, fuy,
depression.... Many have been beautiful and many eloquent.

As i've already tossed out (rather bruquely) once, i understand the
problem we are facing to be a systemic one and not one of particular evil
powerful men.  In this respect i feel many of the specific comments made
about "why" and "how" we are in this situation, are inadequate.

(i'm moved to reiterate this now, because of Hilton's comment that the
"right-wing impeachment coup" will have various consquences--he implies it
will strengthen the x'n right, cause things to go worse in the "culture
wars" etc. ....All of which is surely approximatly accurate. )

My problem with the liberal analysis that folks have offered, both
regarding the aggression against Iraq and the impeachment circus, is
that they vastly overestimate the importance of clinton and his regime.

i submit that no aspect of life in the U.S. was improved by the accension
of clinton and his wing of the republicrat struture:  **THEY ADMITTED** as
much, emphasizing the right-wing character of their agenda.

Look at the overall dynamics: of capital's attack on unions, the runaway
of US industry to low-wage markets and the reduction of us in the US to
primarily a minimum wage postindustrial service economy, the hostility to
any politics of liberation (continually attacked in the media as "pc"),
the furious destruction of what was always a laughably minimal US welfare
structure, the disappearance of affordable housing, the smashing of
affirmative action, the breath-taking rapidity with which (due to social
policies and corporate strategy, working together) income and affluence
and free time are polaraizing between a tiny upper 12 percent and the
majority of people...who are becoming something close to a peon class,
disenfranchised and inactive.

If our culture, poetic and otherwise, is to have any chance of breathing,
i would argue that we need to understand where the violence and social
problems are coming from:  they do not come from the republican wing of
the republicrat structure, and this is why (in contrast to Hilton's
eloquent posts) i do not feel that the "impeachment coup" is anything but
a distraction.  The right wing (of which clinton is an important leader)
wants most of all for citizens to think the impeachment nonsense
**matters**.  It does not.

It is alternatives to the republicrat monolith that will give hope to
democracy and the public sphere in US life.  Not imagining that slick
Willy and the "Democrats" are our friends....

so afraid of adversity? Thanks for the mean posts once in awhile. I am bored

Joel objected to what David Divizio said about impeachment/war and he
said so, somewhat insultingly. I objected to Joel's put-down and I said
so, with minimal insult. Gabe also objected to Joel's put-down and he said
so, very insultingly. (Insult is very much a male sport thus far).  Pierre
Joris rode in with luke warm diarrhea in a dixie cup: he objected to
Gabe's objections and he didn't just say so, he also told Gabe: "Get off
this list."

Thus far several folks have written in paying tribute to Joel.
Now several other folk write in paying vituperation to Gabe.  Many
of these people take to insults as to the manner born.  Problem is: they
also try to flex muscle: Get off this list...I second that... Get thee
hence, Gabe.

Okay, everyone's hot under the collar today, and yesterday (maybe because
of powerlessness?).  But do you really want to create a mini-list-parody
of the parody that's happening in Congress?  What we deal with here is
language, a dangerous enough property.  What does it mean to say "Your
insults are unacceptable.  Your apologies are unacceptable.  Get off this
list"?  Are you claiming the high moral ground, despite your production of
variously temperatured shit?  And are these little poetics prose missiles
intended to eliminate, delete, annihilate?  One speaker after another may
well pipe up "I second that" -- eliminate the irritant; just as one
speaker after another is standing up in Congress saying the same thing;
and those ole cruise missiles, which have just about given up on talk, are
just pop-popping with the same message: eliminate him/them.

We have words here.  We're nobodies in this democracy.  Let's use them
to the best of our ability, this way and that way and any which way.
Let's slip down off the high moral ground.  Let's have the discretion to
choose our words carefully as individuals.  And for the sake of the
little gaps between words or the next chapbook or god knows the MLA or
whatever you/we guys hold valuable, let's stop issuing marching orders.

Mairead

P.S. To David Bromige: Samuel Beckett probably would have very little to
say about all this (though he was quite a proponent of "insultive poetics"
himself, witness "Waiting for Godot"). In some sense, I suppose, the
French Government awarded him the Croix de Guerre for keeping his mouth
shut. And France was Beckett's "country" only because he allowed it to be.

chris, hey... i *did* indicate that i didn't think the statement in
question was "THE fucking problem"...

and i should add, that joel managed in his post to use the word
"personally"---have a look at his post again...

point is that i was differentiating mself from joel, even as i spoke on his
behalf (as it were)... which (i think, very understandable) way of
conducting oneself ends up becoming a matter of polarizing forces on the
list (listen up, gabe, while you toot that horn of yours)... not wishing to
polarize further, chris, i think what you say has to do with how joel went
about saying what he said... i still think what he wanted was to nip in the
bud what seemed to him (yet another) escalating exchange... but i take your
point re nipping a potential contributor, even if i think joel's departure
over this matter is downright disheartening, not least b/c i think (as
others have indicated) that we owe him our gratitude for all of his work on
this list over the years...

on another thread:

mark p, i do hear what you're saying, believe me, and i respect (as you
know) your political acumen... but don't you think, politically speaking,
that we've got to support what vestige we have of liberal/left thinking?...
i mean, clinton is no utopia, but he's a far sight better than a hard &
fast right-winger, no?....

List discourse is often read as more hostile and less amusing than it is
meant to be, but when it is -meant- to be overtly hostile and insulting,
it probably shouldn't be posted.

I hope the list survives all this -- I suppose it can, the way most
families survive the spontaneous annual reenactments of Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf that go under the name of Thanksgiving Dinner.

Joel,
This is Bullshit! Your attack on David D.'s post had the net effect of
humiliating a newcomer to the list and if you didn't do it
intentionally, it certainly had that effect judging from his followup
response. Wher's your apology to David D. Your "water cooler" post had
the same cold, calculating, unfeeling tone that Bernstein's purges of
Henry Gould had. And don't use the 'Alan Sondheim comments' canard. What
Sondheim knows about Post-World War II American history you could put in
a paper bag, light on fire and leave on Vernon Walters' front porch.
Actually, I take that back; it doesn't reach the level of a prank. The
concensus against Gudding on the list sounds like the 'patriotic'
concensus for the current institutionalized murder over the skies of
Iraq and there are certainly enough sociological studies on the nautre
and operation of institutions to explain why this appears so.
Admittedly, I stayed out of the Blow Up/Job discussion because, Joel is
right. In this venue it could never rise above a media reactive 'water
cooler' generalized breast beating. But that's not to say I'd stop it;
I'd simply choose not to participate. I would certainly not try to
regulate based on the poster's artistry and/or professional position;
something that seems to happen with some frequency through the Poetics
ministry of information.
There was a little blither on this list about Pinochet. But nothing
about the tens of millions of dollars that transnational corporations
and their stooges on both sides of Congress, in the executive, as well
as several intelligence services flooded the Venezuelan elections with
in order to defeat Hugo Chavez. All that illegality and immorality
failed and we have the makings of another
Chile/Indonesia/Brazil/Guatemala etc. etc. that Joel, one can presume,
would have arbitrated in an ignorant and passionless fashion after the
fact. The Post for Dec. 12 had a headline that read, "Venezuelans
Relieved As Chavez Eases Rhetoric." The inquisitive reader is left to
wonder if the majority of Venezuelans who voted for Chavez and the 3/4
of the population that are starving, 300+ of whom died in bread riots
that led to Chavez's failed coup, are the ones relieved. Of course not.
The Post means the 2% Venezuelan elite, transnational corporations and
their stockholders and the puppet governments in Washington and Langley
that already have an array of contingencies in place if Chavez fails to
bow to 'free market democratic principles.' The Post means the people
that 'matter', e.g. the ones with money and power, are relieved.
This list is too petty to establish a parallel with the above. But its
also too petty to provide an alternative.
Can you deny there is ass-kissing galore on this list? Haven't any of
you read Amato's posts from the Perloff/Bernstein lecture? And wasn't
Bernstein's approach either delusional or intentionally contentless, at
least as can be determined from what Amato billed as a F/2/F with B.
That didn't sound like the parts of the anatomy that were meeting in
this instance. And Bernstein had been caught out in some lies. Can you
have poetics much less poetry in this atmosphere? Or do you end up with
a bunch of nobodies outside their tiny little professional lives
deluding themselves about the importance of their essentially
meaningless projects. Christ, I'm one fuckin' step away in my bookstore
and your discussions would never find resonance there.
And so what if Gudding is a better imaginative writer/poet than
Bernstein. I've read both guys and that's the way the talent hierarchy
falls out in my judgment. But then again, I'm not going to MLA. Further,
this makes conversation with Gudding more valuable to me than
fraternization with Bernstein, Perloff or Joel for that matter. Joel's
not evil enough to, say, conjure up images of Baby Doc getting on a
plane for the south of France and the list if it persists in its
priggishness won't be worth a damn in the world most of humanity
operates in anyway. And its participants will be able to bring less and
less to that world as they persist in their bunker poetics, which for
all the world smells like a consequence of Langpo. I would never dream
of discussing history with you folks. I got a half dozen retired CIA
operations guys to scream at in my store. And they come back for more
because, and it hurts me to say it, they believe, in their own
'complicated', lesser of two evil ways. I'd never tell them I'm a poet
because poetry in its present incarnations is so ludicrous and
immaterial, they'd laugh in my face.---Carlo Parcelli

Joe----

i agree with folks who feel that **some** room needs to be left for actual
direct exchanges on poetics.

So i'll try to be terse.  Clinton really has not pursued policies to the
left of Reagan and Bush, in a vast majority of areas and issues.  He was
selected for the demo nomination in the first place because of his
profound commitment to crushing unions and working people in Arkansas.

i believe very very intensely, that you're increasing the problems we
face, when you imagine that the demo wing of the republicrat structure can
in any way help us.

it is **completely** controlled by big capital; THAT IS WHAT IT EXISTS
FOR.. ;  in the fine eloquent formulation of Canadian labor scholar and
activist Elaine Barnard, the D & R wings of the republicrats **are not
parties** (parties are sustained by a mass membership, who have voting
rights and determine the party's direction), they are guided entirely by
those who have huge amounts of funds, & essentially they function as arms
of the government:  *they are voter registration mechanisms* ;

i shudder a bit at the phrase "liberal/left"...But let me not become
contentious over semantics (..there's more than semantics at issue there,
but i'm trying to be terse!!)

If you wish to "support what vestige we have of left thinking," then
please do so!!! One CAN'T do so by "wasting one's vote" (and other
resources) in support of clinton and the "demo's", whose agenda is
essentially that of the repubs..  I would argue that the vestige we need
to support resides in the section of the Left that is trying to build a
movement that can reach ordinary people with a politics not beholden to
corporate hegemony:  the New Party, the Labor Party, the various state and
national Green parties, Campaign for a New Tommorow, the Independent
Progressive Politics Network (which links many of the parties i've
mentioned), etc.

tersely (sorta)

Thanks for the attack. What I know about WWII history? You don't know a

I love how mean-spirited this list is getting at this point. Let's all

I found your comments insulting to the extreme. Not that it matters here

Chris,

I very much support all the points you make in your note just now (by the way,
should I continue to cc these note to "nonce") and your approach seems wise to
me. I think the quicker you get out the new Welcome Message the better it would
be. When do you think you will do this?

JOEL AND I WILL BOTH BE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU AS LONG AS YOU NEED US!

I think it would be worthwhile to send out to the new sub that Joel authorized
but who did not verify address -- Pompeiij@AOL.COM -- the following note:

We very much appreciate your interest in the poetics list. We have not yet
received your registration form, as requested. Registration is required of all
those joining the list. Please be sure to return this form to us soon that you
subscription can be confirmed.

I would then send a message to the listserv:

quiet del poetics Pompeiij@AOL.COM

and only OK sub when you receive confirmation. You might want to wait a bit for
this to see what happens, but verification has been in place for over a year
and is a sensible policy. But that's up to you.

I am not going to reply to "R. Gancie/C.Parcelli" <alphavil@ix.netcom.com>
because I have already spoken to these spurious points and there doesn't seem
anything to gain by it; except that of course some people out there will no
doubt believe anything bad said, I suppose -- However, I think restrain remains
the best policy for me.

I'd hold off on all new subs till after New Year's.

***
This should be put on top of the Welcome message for anyone requesting a
subscription. No one should be added to the list without getting this back.

carlo, i hope to hell you're not accusing me of asskissing... for one
thing, i am, as i've said again and again, friends with marjorie and
charles (so yes, please, consider the source when i refer to these two)...
bob archambeau can attest to the fact that the following is what i posted
him (backchan) when he asked me (on the list) to say something about
marjorie's and charles's talk:

>wasn't gonna post on the marjorie/charles event, given the recent
>shenanigans on >poetix (and my feeble attempt to mediate same), but am
>glad you gave me the >opportunity of doing so...

naturally, i felt that posting in on the event would be read as
asskissing... that said, i'm happy bob gave me the opportunity by coaxing
me some, b/c i had a few things to say (albeit not all that much, b/c
that's not my m.o.)...

anyway, i don't as a rule kiss ass (i like to think i NEVER do, but i
probably do in ways i'm not aware of)... in fact, asskissing is the one
thing i was taught as a kid NEVER to do... i'm not sure how to go about
proving that i'm not an asskisser, which of course points to the beauty of
making such an allegation in the first place... but if we ever do get to
meet f2f, i'm pretty certain you'll walk away from the encounter firmly
believing that i'm anything but an asskisser...

yeah, so I sez, i know...

my sincere apologies, carlo, if i'm misreading you here... if i'm not
(misreading you here), well i've got boundless energy, as you know, to beat
the drums with you backchannel about this sort of bullshit...

OK -- now I have done it. Since Joel's resignation today I have been scrambling
to pick up the administrative details of the list, despite feeling very leery
about the whole state of affairs here, and wanting myself to bow out of this
situation, I had hoped more gracefully than I appear to be. I am trying to find
someone to take over the management of the list, something I cannot continue to
do. Meanwhile, I am trying to follow up the list maintenance issues left
unresolved, including the question of  unconfirmed list registration.
Unfortunately, my last communication on this was sent out over the list instead
of privately, but I suppose it expresses my extreme personal frustration with
the situation.

And the blue ribbon award for free speech goes to...
Joel Kuzsai:

So now we've resorted to physically threatening people who don't agree
with us?
The list might be a nicer place with a little less testosterone and a
little less alcohol.

It is an odd culture these lists.  I think everyone should read a book or
something and just chill for a day or two.

Joel,
I too noted that you indicated "personally".  I hope I'm not the
straw.......because it would be a pity if honest naive innocent ignorant
emotion...the thing we so cherish MOST were what was pushing you off such an
IMPORTANT LIST.  This place is about far more than vanity.
Hey, take a break......the truth doesn't have to.  It's always here.  You'll
be back.

I'm sorry I didn't email you last night if that would have helped......but
then again I'm glad I didn't.  Real situations bring up real
responses......and that's how we move forward........or sideways.....but
please don't BACK UP!

Sincerely,
David 2 Divizio

PLEASE backchannel.  I've quickly understood what's out there!

We are presently reorganizing the Poetics List and will be announcing our new
format shortly after New Year's. No further posts to the Poetics List will be
sent out until our reorganization is complete, so please don't send any post to
the list in the meantime.

Sorry for any inconvenience

& best to all the holidays to all!
