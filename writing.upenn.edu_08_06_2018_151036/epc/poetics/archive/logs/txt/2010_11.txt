1.)  "Poet S=E9amas Cain heads to Ireland ..."

in the issue for Thursday, September 16th, 2010,

Volume Number 127, Issue Number 37, on page A5

_______________


The IMRAM Festival has published a CD of S=E9amas Cain chanting the poem
tr=EDd an gcoill.  Slavek Kwi, the Czech sound-artist, in a stereo mix,
has surrounded Cain's voice with the music of nature in Dromore Woods,
County Clare, Ireland ... the sound of the wind and the sounds of
birds, the movements of the trees and the sounds of raindrops, and

Occasionally=2C an opportunity to be a small part of a large change present=
s itself. This is that opportunity. My name is Jessica Kendall=2C and my co=
lleague Marlee Stempleman and I are attempting to create a poetry project t=
hat we hope will unify students and teachers from Title I schools=2C as wel=
l as poets from across the nation.=20

We currently teach at Turner High School=2C located in Kansas City=2C Kansa=
s. Last year=2C Marlee created a poetry club known as the Turner Troubadour=
s. Through this club=2C we both witnessed firsthand the power of poetry as =
a means for expressing the emotions and overcoming the obstacles that are u=
nique to students from Title I or low-income backgrounds.=20

Last year=2C the club produced one publication=2C which can be viewed at ww=
w.lulu.com (search Turner Troubadours). This year=2C the club will be produ=
cing three publications. While the Troubadours club is experiencing great s=
uccess at Turner High School=2C both Marlee and I feel that this is not eno=
ugh. This year=2C we are seeking to recreate this experience at any and all=
 Title I schools across the nation.=20

We are currently accepting poetry submissions from all Title I schools=2C a=
nd we need any and all of the help that we can get in soliciting and collec=
ting student's work. With these submissions=2C we plan on creating a three-=
part anthology that will consist of =93I Remember=94 poems=2C Six-Word Memo=
irs and free-verse poems. The book will also contain information dedicated =
to the educator about how to teach poetry=2C which will help debunk all of =
the myths of teaching and reading poetry and promote the love of poetry acr=
oss all curriculums.=20

To make this project a reality we need your help. We are looking for any an=
d all assistance in the funding=2C publication and promotion of this projec=
t. We graciously appreciate any support that you are able to provide=2C and=
 we ask that if you are not able to help=2C you forward this information on=
 to anyone who may be able to assist with the project. Any donation will be=
 directly applied to making this project a reality=2C and your assistance w=
ith the project will be noted in the publication.=20

We wholeheartedly support our students=2C and believe in the power of the p=
en as our students navigate an often difficult and challenging world. With =
a little help=2C we believe this project has the potential to bridge many g=
aps and bring together a nation of underserved students. Please be a small =
part of what has the power to be a large change in the lives of Title I stu=
dents across the nation.=20

Greetings, readers and federal agents assigned to their cases! Soy solo
palabras but wish to be a city by León De la Rosa (and illustrated by
Gui.ra.ga7) and Monolith by Anne McMillen are now here! But I can't mail
them to you yet, because I won't be! Take advantage of my absurd travel
plans and order a copy now at
http://www.unlikelystories.org/10/delarosamcmillen1010.shtml to get free
shipping to the US and Canada! These books will ship around Thanksgiving.

Mind, you can get yours before then if you happen to be in New Orleans,
Boston, or New York! Because in twelve hours, I'll be hitting the road,
and you'll be able to catch Unlikely at seven great events this month!

McMillen, Tim Millas, Donna Snyder and maybe even Louise Landes Levi --
one can never tell!

And hey! I've got a YouTube channel at
http://www.youtube.com/user/JonathanPenton -- how undignified or awesome
or whatever is that? In fact, I bet if you go to places like that and
http://www.unlikelystories.org/blog , you'll be able to find out all
sorts of socially inappropriate things about this mini-tour as they
happen! Or even better -- as I unscrupulously reconstruct them! Or find
us on FaceFook -- the least efficient information dissemination system
devised yet!

Hope to see you soon,

Sorry, pal. If you're a writer or if you're Asian American, odds are you
were once a nerd. Don't be ashamed--you're all grown-up now and besides,
thanks to Andre 3000, Tina Fey, and Google, nerd chic is in. So, throw on
your most festive attire and stumble over to the swankiest Asian Art gallery
in New York, where we'll have drinks and dancing. You can support your
favorite nonprofit by gazing shyly at the cute red-haired girl across the
room, getting drunk in the presence of writers like*Tao Lin, Richard Price,
Lorraine Adams, Nami Mun, and Karan Mahajan,* and dance awkwardly in the
corner with your favorite sexy nerd. Featuring jazz legend *Fred Ho* and hip
hop ensemble *Das Racist* as musical guests. You bring the sexy, we'll bring
the nerd. Admission comes with free sexy nerd glasses.

*Online ticket sales close on Friday, November 5 at 6PM.*

A stray tom lightly pissed on my copy of Charles Bukowski's Burning In
Water, Drowning in Fire while I was out getting a six-pack of Rolling
Rock and a bag of tortilla chips c. 1977.  You have to understand that
Westminster, Maryland was the kind of place at that time where you
didn't have to lock your door, the crime rate was so low.  (This has
since changed, unfortunately, for a variety of reasons.)  In addition to
leaving my door unlocked, I left my window open more than a crack
because my girlfriend earlier in the day had burnt the T.V. dinners she
had diligently been preparing until I walked into the kitchen and she
started tearing my clothes off of my broad, hod-carrier's shoulders
(yes, I was a hod carrier at that time), in a rush for what eventually
became mutual carnal fulfillment.  Well, while we were off in the other
room doing our best imitations of the illustrations in our dog-eared
copy of the Karma Sutra, which she had gotten me for an early Christmas
present (and which sported its own interesting stains and creases, but
that's another posting), the timer went off on the stove, and we
failed--naturally--to hear it.  It wasn't until plumes of smoke from
the flaming gravy and turkey slices alerted us to the emergency
situation in the kitchen, that we gave over feeding our "fleshier
flame," rushed into the kitchen and put the fire out with souvenir
tumblers (Little Jimmy Dickens had just played at the Civic Center and
we wanted to remember our first date) of tap water.  It was then that we
noticed that we were out of cigarettes, but we also reminded each other
(she to me) that we were giving the old coffin nails up.  I also
commented that we were lacking the latest Sporting News from the
Baltimore area tracks (Bowie, Pimlico), but then I reminded both of us
that we had given up gambling at the same time that we gave up
ritualistic post-coital smoking.  Just then the phone rang and my girl
friend had to assist her mother stringing beans and boiling pig's feet
for the great Methodist revival meeting the following day--which, as you
probably guessed--was a Sunday.  She kissed me at the door (still
smelling of sex and turkey smoke), and I decided it was time to go to
the High's at the Westminster Shopping Center.  The room was still
smoky, so I opened the window to let the country air in.  It took me a
bit longer to get back than I'd anticipated: I had been somewhat
indecisive in deciding which beer to get--National Bo, or Rolling Rock.
I decided after some minutes of ear-pulling that Rolling Rock was
cheaper, and more aesthetically pleasing, I might add, in its green
"pony" bottles.  That final, more spiritual point, was the clincher of
the decision.  When I came back to my apartment and turned on the
lights, I surprised a thin tabby tom cat in the midst of eating the TV
dinners from my trash can.  When it saw me it leaped back to the
windowsill and out.  I made a thorough check of every room, but did not
discover anything untoward until about a week later, when I noticed in
the living room corner that a stack of books there displayed evidence of
being micturated upon.  The top book on the stack--the
Bukowski--suffered the worst damage.  The cat urine had soaked into and
through the thick and attractive paper cover that Black Sparrow editions
feature.  My girlfriend (let's call her "Nell") was a rather
religious young lady, and I believe that she had been thumbing through
the book and had placed it, face-down, on the top of the stack when she
heard me return.  (I hear she later married a Baptist minister who holds
forth on the local cable open access station and has developed something
of a following).  Or at least I suspect so, as "Nell" would have been
the only person to go browsing through my books at the time.  I found
that the urine had completely dried and the pages--including the "about
the author" with a youngish Bukowski doing an imitation of Jack Kerouac
(or Jack London?) jumping a freight train, and which also included the
staggering information that Bukowski was much more popular in Germany
than in California--were adhering together and exhibited the same
waviness that one expects in ordinary water damage.  This damage was
amplified and compounded in the severely damaged section by the
brownish-yellow Elmer's glue "slab-like"concretion of pages for a
full eighth of an inch.  As I gingerly began to pull these pages apart I
noticed a slight unmeshing sound, as if tiny Velcro patches were being
separated. With each light tug, a cloud of dried urine arose, pungent,
palpable, and clearly visible in the slant of sunlight in which I was
working.  I'm happy to record that the rest of the book did not suffer
such severe damage, but the dried cat urine had thickened and discolored
the spine to such an extent that any attempt at reading would expose a
stain of a good quarter of each page running "up" and at a diagonal
from the gutter to the opposite (upper) right angle of each page.  Some
of the pages displayed a brownish translucency due to the chemical
action of the cat piss that allowed one to almost see "through" one of
the texts and into and through the next.  However, this only applied in
the case of one or two signatures.  For the most part, the staining grew
lighter and less invasive as one proceeded through the volume from front
to back, and on the title page disappeared entirely.

Kenning Editions <http://www.kenningeditions.com>, Oracle Productions
<http://www.oracletheatre.org>, and Poetry Magazine
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org> are proud to announce a special
collaboration that will give six local poets 48 hours to devise a
program of Poets Theater, accompanied by a panel discussion with
Chicago-based poets, playwrights, and critics, plus a talkback and a
book launch for /*The Kenning Anthology of Poets Theater: 1945-1985*/,
edited by Kevin Killian and David Brazil. The six poets will first meet,
devise and rehearse on Saturday, December 4, and present their work on
Sunday, December 5, at Oracle Theatre, 3809 N. Broadway in Chicago.
Sunday's panel discussion begins at 6:00 PM and the performance follows
at 7:30. Talkback and book party follow immediately. Admission is free
and open to the public in Oracle's *Public Access Theatre*. Reservations
are strongly recommended and can be made at www.
<http://www.oracletheatre.org>oracletheatre.org.

Although poetry and drama have been kin from Sophocles to Shakespeare,
Milton, Stein and Baraka, Poets Theater has remained an opportunely
loose form, often liberating poets or playwrights from proprietary
impulses. Poets Theater has migrated between the mainstage and parlor
affairs. It has built a secret history for itself, from the alternate
Noh tradition of the Cambridge Poets Theatre of the 1950s to Leslie
Scalapino's appropriation of thematic and formal registers of the
Elizabethan theater; the Living Theatre's  productions of Greek tragedy
to the adjudications of identity and community values after the
counter-culture: El Teatro Campesino, Black Arts theater, and the
conceptualist performance of Adrian Piper or Theresa Hak Kyung  Cha, for
example. Interest in poets theater can be glimpsed in recent festivals,
journals, one-off productions, and anthologies.

One of the latter, /*The Kenning Anthology of Poets Theater: 1945-1985
*/presents the occasion for a Chicago-centric Poets Theater experiment.
On Saturday, December 4, six local poets begin work together at Oracle,
each with a copy of the anthology, some technical support, and about 48
hours, in which time they will conceive, rehearse, and perform a program
of Poets Theater. A unique experiment in how the theater space and
fundamental conventions of drama serve as studio to poets of various
aesthetics, imposing as little premeditation as possible, who knows if a
new play will be written, old ones compiled or mashed up? On Sunday,
December 5, Kenning Editions, Oracle Productions, and Poetry Magazine
host a roundtable event and talkback to complement the performance,
featuring participants from the performance, poetry, and theater
communities of Chicago. The roundtable will serve as an introduction to
and a conversation on Poets Theater as a genre. The post-show talkback
will facilitate a response to the evening's performance specifically,
allowing the poets/performers to answer audience questions and comment
on their experience as an ensemble. The evening concludes with a launch
for the anthology with food, drink, and informalities of all kinds.

I was sitting in a Baltimore crabhouse thinking of Thomas Hardy while
absent-mindedly paging through a copy of the 1905 reprint of The Black
Riders and Other Lines by the "boy-genius" Stephen Crane, which I was
lucky enough to find at the Enoch Pratt Library's bargain table book
sale one Saturday c. early 1980, when a jealous husband mistook me for
his wife's lover and attacked me with a letter-opener he'd bought (the
police later found out) on a whim at a Stucky's in Gettysburg, PA
during one of his last "happy" afternoons in the presence of his
suspected cheating spouse.  Luckily, the aggrieved husband was of a
"gracile" build and was none-too-handy with the letter opener.  As he
shouted some garbled words of abuse in my direction, I immediately arose
and plucked up a wooden crab mallet, tore off my bib, and prepared to
throw the wet remains of the crabs that I had just consumed into the
man's face, and then bop him on either temple as he fell, in my best
imitation of the biblical heroine Jael--less the spike.  Among the
screams of the diners the frenzied husband lunged awkwardly at me and
managed to stab the point of the letter opener into the plain cloth
cover of Stephen Crane's pioneering poems, which I held in my left
hand, in a happily successful attempt to deflect the blow from my heart.
 I recall at exactly that moment wondering what damage had occurred to
the text--funny how one's mind works in an "emergency
situation"--before I plucked a tin of "Old Bay Seasoning" quite
literally "from out of the blue"--(yes, the crabhouse sported a
battery of blue "cool ray" bulbs to soften the harsher florescent
lighting that spilled in from the adjoining kitchen)--thrown to me by a
young waiter whom I had been tipping rather heavily that evening.  In a
thrice I popped off the lid with my thumb and lashed the powder into my
attacker's eyes.  He screamed and collapsed on the table among the
crabshells, wet newspapers--largely the old News American sports pages,
if I recall correctly--and partially imbibed "National Bo" bottles.
By this time the police had been called and one powerfully muscled
Polish gentleman had wrenched the letter opener from the jealous
husband's hand while he wallowed, pitifully weeping, on the floor.
Almost at the same moment a few of the other diners had secured the
man's surprisingly frail wrists with a "clip-on" tie that one of them
had been sporting--much to the amusement of his date.  Of course I
denied being the Lothario as repeatedly described in the husband's
sniveling accusations to the police, and they nodded in perfect
agreement, noting that though I had beer on my breath, I passed every
test of sobriety they subtly appraised me by, and, in addition, I
appeared to one and all to be be a morally upright, God-fearing,
tax-paying, citizen of the LARGER BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON AREA.  The
sergeant, after taking my account of the incident, abruptly turned to
the other policemen and simply said the words "book-em," as he clicked
his glittering Bic 90, whereupon the culprit was frog-marched away to
the waiting Black Maria shouting both apologies to the other diners, and
imprecations addressed in less-than-flattering terms at your humble
correspondent, though, not knowing my TRUE NAME appeared to pose certain
difficulties which were nigh insurmountable for the pitiable,
soon-to-be-convict in the heat of his tantrum.  To show my appreciation,
I bought a bushel of crabs each for the Polish gentleman and the diners,
and ordered a round of "National Bo" for everyone in the crabhouse.
After receiving the accolades and salutations of one and all, I sat down
at my table and stared out at the night sky.  It was then that I
remembered my copy of Stephen Crane's Black Riders and proceeded to
examine the cause of my being alone at the crabhouse in the first
place--i.e. my celebrating the lucky purchase of this remarkable volume
earlier in the day.  The point of the letter opener was thick enough to
more dent than pierce the center of the tough "board" cover of the
volume.  It followed as I suspected, however, that the indentation was
repeated through the front matter and the early pages of the text,
becoming more shallow as it proceeded through the thickness of each page
to end, finally, in an obliterated letter "n" in the fourth line, 5th
word, of the following poem found on page 11 of the volume in question:

SHOULD THE WIDE WORLD ROLL AWAY,
LEAVING BLACK TERROR,
LIMITLESS NIGHT,
NOR GOD, NOR MAN, [ ]OR PLACE TO STAND
WOULD BE TO ME ESSENTIAL,
IF THOU AND THY WHITE ARMS WERE THERE,
AND THE FALL TO DOOM A LONG WAY.

Mowing the lawn of the upscale Milwaukee apartment complex as a favor to
"Len" the landlord, c. 1990, I forgot that I had left my copy of
Jackson MacLow's Pronouns (Station Hill, 1977) within easy reach of
Len's pet capuchin monkey "Gifted."  Len took Gifted everywhere he
went in those palmy days, the monkey, tricked out in handsome blue
pampers, collar and shiny chain leash, riding easily on Len's shoulder
as he made his rounds inspecting the various properties owned by the
Gillis Group.  Len that day was in an expansive mood, and after
signalling that I should take a break, shared some of his iced tea from
out of the Styrofoam cooler he carried in his truck.  The tea really
"hit the spot" in the hot weather.  Len enjoyed discussing
Wittgenstein, who apparently was a distant relative, and so each time we
met he invited me to explore the Blue or Brown books with him.  He liked
to pose Wittgenstein's questions to me and wait for my answer, or
sometimes he would invent his own Wittgensteinian questions using the
props at hand--like "Gifted" for instance--whose perception of "tool
use" and language recognition, provided fertile ground for the creation
of open-ended questions in the best (to Len) Wittgensteinian tradition.
"What would the verb "to reconnoiter" mean to a a monkey's like
Gifted?  If Gifted had to choose between the color green (as in paint)
and the concept of the color green, which would he be more likely to
anticipate in his everyday perceptions in this suburban jungle of
ours?"  I would often shake my head and attempt to signal my awe at the
depths of this display of heuristics on my landlord's part, simply
because he was kind enough to allow me to move into his building without
a security deposit.  It was during one of these sessions, the lawn mower
turned off, and Len pacing back and forth before me declaring that
thinking in such a manner was "hard as hell," that Gifted freed
himself from Len's chain, plucked up my copy of Jackson MacLow's
classic, climbed into the top branches of an oak tree, and larded the
humid air with pages, and fragments of pages, bitten in small, moist
mouthfuls, from my copy of The Pronouns.  The torn and mangled pages
floated down as those autumn leaves described in the Edwin Arlington
Robinson poem "Luke Havergal" as slaying themselves as they fall, and
indeed, as I noted the steady deconstruction of my book proceeding from
on high, I motioned to Len, pointed up to where his miscreant monkey was
just wadding up the photograph of Jackson, his son, and Iris Lezak
processing about the Pronouns performance space years earlier, to pitch
it, and the torn, twisted  and bitten through spine, into Milwaukee's
equivalent of a zen-Buddhist, aleatory abyss,  Len clapped his hands and
angrily called to Gifted to return, but the capuchin would have none
ofit, knowing all too well that a Wittgensteinian box on the ear awaited
it.  We therefore spent most of the afternoon drinking Len's iced tea
with our shirst off, writing down Len's dictated thoughts on language
and primate perception on a legal pad that he provided me, and
speculating when Gifted would come back from his assault on both heaven
and my book.  About sun-down Gifted leaped from the lower branches of
the oak into Len's arms. Len exhibited more joy at his "bad boy's"
return than anger, and so ruled out corporal punishment for the time
being.  I had already collected the scraps and fragments of my MacLow
masterwork, and spread them out across the patio wondering if I should
attempt to reconstruct the volume, or simply toss the dice in order to
generate even more possibilities "for the dancers".  I opted for the
latter, and am now editing a monkey-mauled textual epilogue for a
possible, limited edition, addition to Jackson MacLow's collected
works. If any publisher out there might be interested, or wish further
information regarding Len and his monkey, please contact me via this
list. Jess

My new book has been released by Dos Madres and is available there as well
as SPD, etc.  The book was first inspired by photographs of Nazi-era
fortifications on the coast of France and then morphed into an exploration
of pilgrimage trails and experiences of flight from religious persecution.
That is one way to read the long serial poem that is the title poem.

 *Fall Reading Series at The Renaissance Society *

*Poetry Reading*
Joanna Fuhrman and Suzanne Buffam
*Sunday, November 14, 2:00 pm
Swift Hall Room 106*

Joanna Fuhrman
Currently teaching in the creative writing program at Rutgers, Fuhrman is
the author of four volumes: Pageant (Alice James Books, 2009), Moraine
(Hanging Loose Press, 2006), Ugh Ugh Ocean (Hanging Loose Press, 2003) and
Freud in Brooklyn (Hanging Loose Press, 2000). "Fuhrman is a leader in the
particular, in 'infra-surrealism.' She taboos nothing; no form impedes her
complete wit. This full poetry is not only 'feminine, marvelous, and tough,=
'
but subtle, searching, and wounded-sexual, social, and smart. Fuhrman
celebrates new truth-telling, an art of the spectacular pageant." David
Shapiro

Suzanne Buffam
Currently teaching in the creative writing program at The University of
Chicago, Buffam's first collection of poetry, Past Imperfect (House of
Anansi, 2005), won the Gerald Lampert Award for the best first book of
poetry published in Canada in 2005, and was named one of 2005's Books of th=
e
Year by the Globe and Mail. Her most recent collection is The Irrationalist=
,
(Canarium Books, 2010). "Buffam's often deadpan tone is like a magical
dustpan that sweeps up the strangest observations and ideas, all worlds to
themselves. Her 'Little Commentaries'-'On Pi=F1atas,' 'On Fountains,' and '=
On
Vanishing Acts' (to name only a few)-are absolute gems, kin to Anne Carson'=
s
town poems and Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. Buffam's poems tug at new corners of
the brain. They're marvelous." Matthea Harvey

This event will take place in Swift Hall Room 106.  (Swift Hall is directly
east of the gallery.) This event is free and open to the public.

Mills College Graduate Assistantship in Community Poetics

Mills College is pleased to introduce a two-year, full-tuition
assistantship to one student pursuing a master of fine arts (MFA) degree
in poetry beginning fall 2011. Candidates for the assistantship will
design and implement a poetry-related community project during the
course of their two-year degree program. The assistantship does not
require a teaching commitment. Under the mentorship of Mills' renowned
faculty, the successful candidate will have the unique experience of
pursuing his/her MFA degree while implementing a community poetics
project of his/her own design. This is a high-profile opportunity to
explore poetry's possibilities for transformative dialogue---at Mills and
beyond.

Background

Continuing the Mills tradition of experimentation in graduate education,
this newly created assistantship is designed to support the development
of innovative, even risky, ways of teaching and/or presenting poetry. As
the number of full-time teaching positions in higher education decline
across the United States, Mills seeks to explore the possibilities of
making poetry available outside traditional academic confines to broaden
access to the art form and utilize it as a force for social change.

This assistantship aligns with the goals of the existing Mills Community
Teaching Project which offers students the opportunity to teach
residents in the communities surrounding the College. Mills graduate
students lead writing workshops in a variety of alternative venues,
including after-school programs, elder homes, community centers,
half-way houses, lock-down facilities, and battered-women's shelters.

Proposals should not replicate the Community Teaching Project but should
re-imagine poetry's socially transformative possibilities. Applicants
are encouraged to imagine a project that in some way propels poetry into
new encounters outside the academy. Some examples of projects that
inspired the creation of this assistantship include Mark Nowak's poetry
workshops with auto workers in the US and South Africa, Heriberto
Yepez's public poetry signage in Tijuana, and June Jordan's Poetry for
the People.

Application Instructions

Applicants should follow and complete the usual application processes
for the MFA in Poetry by the priority application deadline of December 15.

In addition to those materials, they should submit a maximum 1,000-word
proposal that outlines a project they would like to pursue during the
two-year MFA program. Proposed projects could explore new ways of
teaching poetry, expanding arts access, and promoting social change. The
proposed project needs to be executed during the timeframe of the
student's MFA program. It can be a continuation of work the applicant is
already doing.

They should also submit a CV or resume that demonstrates any relevant
experience and skills.

The proposal and CV or resume should be submitted separately from the
program application materials.

Assistantship proposals and CV or resume can be submitted by going to:

www.mills.slideroom.com

The assistantship in Comminity Poetics is listed on slideroom along with
multiple assistantships the deparment offers, and applicants to the MFA
in Poetry program are encouraged to apply for the Community Poetice
assistant ship as well as any other graduate assistantships in which
they are interested. Please note that each student may only be awarded
one assistantship position for the academic year. Please also note that
all other available assistantships carry an award of $3,000/semester or
$6,000 for the academic year and are awarded in addition to any
need-based scholarships students may be awarded. The Assistantship in
Community Poetics is the only full assistantship offered by the MFA in
Creative Writing at Mills College at this time.

NOTE: There is a $10.00 total submission fee to apply for this and any
other assistantships online via SlideRoom; though we prefer that mode,
and we think applicants might find it easier to manage the application.
However, if the $10.00 fee causes a hardship, contact Stephanie Young by
email and include a statement about why you need to waive the
application fee.

Judging Criteria

Proposals will be judged based on:

     1. Creativity
     2. Potential for social impact/change

Deadline: December 15, 2010

Questions please contact:

EMF World
Urgent Opportunity

Simultania Project
Saturday, November 13, 11am EST



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


The Simultania Project is an attempt to experience simultaneous =20
realities by gaining a many-layered perspective of a single moment in =20
time. It?s about our impossible wish to break free from the isolation =20
of a singular sense of consciousness, while at the same time =20
possessing the imaginative power to realize that there are other =20
experiences of consciousness occurring right now besides our own. The =20
project is about our fundamental desire to be special on the one hand, =20
while realizing that it?s this very desire that makes us utterly =20
common on the other. And it?s about how new technologies are changing =20
the way we directly experience the world, and the sheer sense of =20
wonder that results when we realize that simultaneous realities are =20
unfolding around us at all times.

The one major criteria is that participants time-stamp their footage =20
or audio recording so that later it can be synced up to play back =20
simultaneously with everything else in the installation. To do this, =20
set a watch or clock to the live time-count on the website?s homepage.

http://www.simultaniaproject.com/index.html

Then, in the seconds before the 1-minute-moment is set to begin, start =20
your recording by filming the face of your watch or clock (or the live =20
time-count itself on the screen of your computer) as the seconds tick =20
away. Then, without stopping your recording, go on to film whatever =20
you?d like to for the 1-minute-moment.

For more simple time-stamping methods (including audio-only methods), go to:

http://www.simultaniaproject.com/participate.html#p7HGMpc_1_5

The installation will be exhibited in the spring of 2011 in the =20
Streaming Museum?s network of international screens in public spaces =20
and at Here is Elsewhere in Los Angeles, as well as online at =20
simultaniaproject.com and streamingmuseum.org.

Hi Folks - some big news

first - this sunday i'll be one of over 35 poets who will be reading their short poems (no longer than 14 lines) between 2 and 6 at the 7th Annual Brevitas Festival of the Short Poem at the Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery (between Houston and Bleecker Streets) - it will be a lot of fun - everyone who attends will receive a free anthology containing all the poems that are being read plus many more (it's easily worth the $7 price of admission) - plus, while each poem is being read you will see it projected over the poet's head - it's a unique event and one you'll remember

+ + +

second - most of you know my "Information" pieces, an ongoing series of prose poems that explore all kinds of things

well, you can find recent "Information" in the last two issues of the Australian magazine Otoliths at
http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/

in the first online issue of formerly print magazine Caliban at
www.calibanonline.com

in the most recent issue of Right Hand Pointing at
https://sites.google.com/site/rhpissue36/

and in the January-April 2010 issue of Press 1
http://www.leafscape.org/press1/v3n3/heman.html

+ + +

and last (but certainly not least) the lineup for the next BIG CLWN WR Event/Celebration has been pretty much finalized - it will be held on December 4 between 7 and 10 in the Community room at Westbeth and will feature filmaker/performance artist (and poet and dancer and singer) Mindy Levokove, and will include an improvised dance poem by Nathan Whiting and Christina Knight, songs by Carolyn Ota, photographs by Lori Rogers, and poetry by Thomas Fucaloro, Evie Ivy, Judy Kamilhor, Jee Leong Koh, Brian McInerney, Katrinka Moore, Adriana Scopino, George Spencer, Phyllis Wat and Liza Wolsky - more info will follow

SPINELESS BOOKS ANNOUNCES

Riddle & Bind, poetry by Nick Montfort

	http://spinelessbooks.com/riddle

	A book of poems to solve in three sections: "Riddle," poems =
inviting =20
the reader to guess their subject; "Bind," poems written using =20
Oulipian constraints; and "&," riddles written using ludic and poetic =20=

forms. Answers and constraints are disclosed in an encrypted answer =20
key. The book has a introduction and extensive notes, and comes =20
wrapped in an enigmatic riddle-blurb by Christian B=F6k. Nick Montfort =20=

is on the faculty of MIT's Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies =20
and serves as president of the Electronic Literature Organization. He =20=

lives, writes, and programs in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Keyhole Factory, fiction by William Gillespie

	http://spinelessbooks.com/keyholefactory

	Revolving around an event that takes pace on 11/11/11, =
interlocking, =20
formally innovative stories plot the tragic trajectory of a world off =20=

the edge. "...despite its format as a novel (and also its novel =20
format...), Keyhole Factory is poetry at its heart. It suggests, =20
nudges, and paints blurry, horribly beautiful word pictures more than =20=

it tells, and it never uses straightforward prose where an allusive =20
fever-dream will do. It is by turns bewildering and gorgeous, =20
maddening and profound, and at the end of the day, it's a winner."  - =20=

Smile Politely. William Gillespie is the author of eight and five-=20
sixths books of fiction and poetry, published under five names. He is =20=

co-host of the radio show Rock Geek F.M. and holds an MFA in =20
electronic writing from Brown University.

ADVANCE PRAISE FOR RIDDLE & BIND

	I like the way Nick Montfort's poems maintain both brilliance =
and =20
being: never losing either while displaying the other. The poems build =20=

their force by acceleration as they shimmer between imagination and =20
reality, between attention to language and the language of attention. =20=

For example, to note that many passersby are gripping "head wounds" - =20=

the first two words of "Another Hole" - is striking; that what these =20
passersby are clutching is their mobile phones is mordantly funny. And =20=

beyond that, the poem ("Another Hole") deploys Montfort's distinctive =20=

gifts of ear, eye and brain to consider genuine, figurative wounds: =20
"Heal them, please/ please press their/ heads together,/ O." This is a =20=

boldly original, serious and playful book of genuine poetry.
	- Robert Pinsky

	Ancient poetic tradition teaches both the prism-house (riddle) =
and =20
prison-house (bind) of language. Old English riddles artfully mislead =20=

us, only to return sparkling awareness of what had been lost as =20
commonplace once they are solved, the language-practice of riddle =20
defeating the graying-out effects of ordinary speech.
	All of world-poetry uses the constraints of sound-following, =
measure, =20
and form. A drive to preserve traditional constraints co-exists with a =20=

constant pressure to discover or elaborate new ones. Most recently, =20
visual, lettristric, mathematical, and algorithmic constraints have =20
been explored by Oulipians, digital writers, and others.
	Nick Montfort=92s Riddle & Bind comes informed by all these =
practices, =20
especially enriched by his experience as a prizewinning writer of =20
digital interactive fiction and as a coder of concise, elegant poetry =20=

generators.
	Dive in to the riddles and bound poems of Riddle & Bind as gifts =
of =20
21st-century language - and turn to the "key" at the end of the book =20
if your enjoyment includes the "answers" or curiosity about =20
constraints. Deep pleasure awaits you.

On Matuk:
=20
Can identity be pliant and penetrable? Can the speech act be one of attenti=
on over intention=2C can play and fluidity open onto an ethic? This Isa Nic=
e Neighborhood=2C Farid Matuk=92s first full-length collection=2C says yes.=
 Yes to the rejection of any opposition between politics and aesthetics=2C =
between rhetoric and poetics. Yes to vulnerability. Yes to a poetry willing=
 to enact the errors=2C uncertainties=2C and tangled complexities of our po=
litical=2C sexual=2C and social lives. Testing both narrative and lyric=2C =
Matuk finds desire at the root of each=2C a root from which=2C these poems =
suggest=2C compassion and permission grow intertwined.
=20

as lived in the U.S. since the age of six. Matuk is the auther of Is it the=

On Leslie:
=20
A chair by Charles and Ray Eames. A painting by Paul Klee. A sentence by Vi=
rginia Woolf. Juliana Leslie=92s debut collection More Radiant Signal broad=
casts its elegant=2C probing lyricism here=2C among the panoply of those wh=
o worked to house extended thought in moments of compressed articulation. W=
ith haunting=2C painterly logic=2C Leslie=92s poems offer a world where the=
 equivocal beauty of algebra and the aerodynamics of paper planes meet "a w=
indowpane in love/ with a bright whirligig" to show that "[t]he boundary of=
 the sky is a touchstone for enunciation." Is there such a thing as an impo=
ssible object? And if not=2C how is that after reading More Radiant Signal =
it sits there perfectly in the center of the room.=20

Juliana Leslie was born in Cooperstown=2C New York and currently lives in S=

NHL BRAIN TRINKET
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=565

What I'm going to tell you-I warn you-is of no consequence whatever. And it
won't even be of any interest to you at all unless you're an NHL hockey fan.
And, what's worse, it's going to severely test your algebra skills. The only
thing I can say in favour of saying it at all is that you just won't ever
read anything else about hockey like what I'm going to tell you right now.
It just doesn't happen. This is the unicorn of hockey writing. Right here,
right now.

It's so messed up to be telling you this at all that I have to give you
something to get you to read it. What I'm going to give you is like
something you'd get for a dollar out of a bubble-gum machine. But maybe the
best such thing you'd get. Cuz it's an idea. It's a formula. It's from the
bubble gum machine of the mind. I figured it out myself. I haven't seen it
mentioned anywhere else. I'm going to give you a little brain trinket. The
formula tells you how many points a perfectly average NHL team should have
after they've played N games. That's it. That's all this is about. The only
use it has is to be able to tell if a team is above or below average. Think
of this as a peculiarly Canadian gift. It's a way to think a little bit more
clearly about something that is barely worth thinking about at all. But, you
know, in Canada, we think about hockey. It's more pleasant than thinking
about the mess we're in.....

Subject:      Barn Murals and Poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello,

I recently finished the first in a series of murals on barns across Maryland. Each mural will be a text and image piece featuring poetry. The project is organized by the University of Maryland Art Gallery in College Park, and is called "Poetic Aesthetic in Rural Maryland". For the first barn I used the poem "Lost" by David Wagoner.

If anyone can offer suggestions for poems about nature (specific poems, anthologies, web sites) I'd appreciate it. Some images of the first barn are at the following links.

On my site:

Thanks!

Excerpts:
=20
=E2=80=9C[T]here are certainly instances where poetry can fill an important=
 political need, and where, perhaps, it can have =E2=80=9Cmajor=E2=80=9D po=
litical effects. As for experimental poetry in the contemporary West=E2=80=
=94I agree with Andrea Brady, when she says, of such poetry, =E2=80=9CAt my=
 most optimistic, I hope it encourages its readers=E2=80=94who, as readers =
seeking out this kind of work, aren=E2=80=99t likely to require encourageme=
nt=E2=80=94to think critically about politics, or perhaps to be inspired by=
 such thinking to participate in collective efforts to overcome the tyranni=
es of capitalism.=E2=80=9D That is, I think that thinking about this kind o=
f poetry can be an important spur to critical thinking about one=E2=80=99s =
assumption=E2=80=94although, like Brady, I do feel there=E2=80=99s a compon=
ent of preaching to the choir involved. Also, I=E2=80=99m not sure this is =
a kind of politics in which poetry has any special role over, say, sociolog=
y or history or ecology. I=E2=80=99ve always been suspicious of claims abou=
t the specia ness of poetry: my colleague Josh Corey, whom I admire, claims=
 that =E2=80=9Conly poetry can undo the Big Lie =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99m not a=
t all sure that=E2=80=99s true, I=E2=80=99m not convinced that film, or mus=
ic, or street protest, or editorial writing, or talking to one=E2=80=99s fr=
iends, isn=E2=80=99t similar in its effect. There=E2=80=99s a kind of narci=
ssism one encounters sometimes in poetry circles, a sense that this thing t=
hat we care for must be of central importance not just to us but to others =
as well. Sometimes we even see the lack of evidence for such importance as =

=E2=80=9CA politics of obscurity? Well: one could argue that there=E2=80=99=

kes the form of what George Steiner calls =E2=80=9Ctactical difficulty,=E2=
=80=9D a kind of encoding of messages to get past censors of one kind or an=
other. This depends on the right kind of reader or auditor being able to pi=
ck up a message that the wrong kind can=E2=80=99t: old style blues lyrics o=
ffer a case in point. There=E2=80=99s another kind of politics of obscurity=
, which we can think of as going back at least as far as the symbolist, dec=
adent, and aesthetic movements. People like Mallarm=C3=A9 or Gustav Moreau,=
 who advocated an art that turned away from the world, and from intelligibi=
lity, as a means of rejecting modernity. If the realist novelists sought to=
 combat social injustice polemically (as did, say Zola or Upton Sinclair), =
this other path offered an implicit critique via the turning of its back on=
 the world. It=E2=80=99s less a transformation of the world than a refusal =
of it, or a retreat. The analogy that comes to mind from my personal experi=
ence is the hippie commune I spent some of my childhood living next door to=
, in Maine. Many of these guys had been politically engaged, trying to chan=
ge policy through protest (a Zola-esque politics, in this analogy), but at =
a certain point they decided to withdraw from that engagement, and turn the=
ir backs on the world they despised, living in obscurity (if that=E2=80=99s=
 not too much of a pun). It=E2=80=99s a politics of sorts, I suppose, in it=
s refusals more than anything else, and its general, unarticulated assertio=
n that there=E2=80=99s got to be another way of doing things. But the ways =
it changes the world=E2=80=94if indeed it does, and I imagine there are way=

=E2=80=9CAs for the question of the academy=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s certainly =
become the main place where one finds poets in the United States, and, incr=
easingly, in the U.K. Of course this has an impact. In the case of the New =
Critics, the first American generation of poets to enter the academy, it di=
d have the effect of playing-up the formalist element of their agenda, for =
reasons that are quite explicit if you read their correspondence. The unive=
rsity demands specialization, and poetry can defend itself as a specializat=
ion=E2=80=94as something distinct from philosophy or history or sociology o=
r journalism=E2=80=94with reference to form.  And if one looks at the kind =
of poetry coming out of academic programs in the United States now, one see=
s it is overwhelmingly elliptical in form: that is, it insists on its disti=
nctness from the language of quotidian prose, on its formal qualities that =
make it a kind of special field of endeavor in an environment that is domin=
ated by the logic of specialization. That=E2=80=99s not the only thing that=
=E2=80=99s going on, but it=E2=80=99s certainly a part of our current cultu=
ral logic. All of this may change, with the big changes that seem likely to=
 come to academe over the next generation, but I=E2=80=99m not in any posit=
ion to make predictions about what lies ahead, except that it will be diffe=
rent from the way we do things now.=E2=80=9D

Hey--Does anyone out there know the origin of the phrase "the revolution =
will not be televised?"  I don't mean the Gil Scott Heron lyrics; I know =
those.  But doesn't the phrase pre-date the Heron song?  Doesn't it come =
from a speech or a poem?  Anyone know?  Thanks--ShaunAnne

As far as I know, this is Gil's own-own aphorism.  And sorry, Websters, Blogosphericals, Netizens, Twitterers, Facebookies -- it's still the truth.  Corollary: The revolution will not be virtual.

As far as I know, it started with Heron -- though as a poem, which he
recites on one album.  The song came a little later.

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series presents

JEREMY BRADDOCK

"The Material Formation of the Field: Charles Abbott's and Carl Van
Vechten's Archives of the Twentieth Century"


November 19th @ 1:00pm

The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen

University at Buffalo

Jeremy Braddock received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and
was a Fellow at Cornell's Society for the Humanities, a Visiting Assistant
Professor at Haverford College, and an Assistant Professor at Princeton
University before coming to Cornell.  A specialist in twentieth-century
American literature and culture, he is finishing a book, *The Modernist
Collector and Black Modernity, 1914-1934*, has edited a collection of essays
on Hollywood "B" movies, and has published articles on the Black Atlantic
and African-American modernism.




Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.


All events are free and open to the public.

Reading poems, such as =93Whoever Answers the Door=94, in Philip Byron Oake=
s=92
second book *Sard*, reminds one of a grandiloquent room=97very modern and p=
osh
with amenities, and at the ready to receive the exhilarated mob attempting
to enter all at once, in a crush of three or four abreast, through a door
constructed for one and one only to enter in style. Luckily we have Philip
Byron Oakes to defuse the chaos, magically narrow the door, creating
tension, putting things in order, resetting the ratio of things to their
meaning once again. The thrill of exhilarated facts, =93the whirlwind
scuttling/a moment of stillness=94, of cultural information streaming off o=
f
each page at the speed of sound, places the reader at the crux of a savant=
=92s
poetic genesis, displacing the literal with the dancing heads of the
figurative and in a big way. Often joking while performing his circus of
fire eating acts, he gets around to lavish spectacles =93Sooner or loiter.=
=94
Details mount and accrue, as what is real=97objective=97is less satisfying =
to
observe than the ritualized, impeccably imbedded electrical buzz and charge
of these manic fragmented tableaux holding place as they surge. Oakes write=
s
as he guns the motor. There is a sense of vertigo that appeals to one=92s
right brain and left brain simultaneously. The language swirls=97a whirlpoo=
l
of stochastic images encountered without fault. The poems are, I feel,
impressively unimpeachable=97shards of focus as imagined works of art. What=
 we
are witness to is the random miracle seemingly made plain=97a vase of flowe=
rs
torn from a table by a cyclone in Kansas (the house ripped to kindling) and
placed down serenely in Sarasota or Reno without so much as a petal harmed.
Such is the force of the poems in *Sard*. *Sard *is a chaotically ruled,
brilliantly conceived, devastating regime of organic and supra-organic
devices that are as delightful to think about and ponder, once having read
them, as they are to read.  =97Raymond Farr, editor of *Blue & Yellow Dog*


A sample poem...


*and-then*



A calypso melody in the frozen food section,

thawing out in the belly of a tourist on the

couch. A codicil of apologies, chasing a

legacy through a penny arcade. An ante

of sugar putting starch in the collar, of the

otherwise naked, for a secularity of vespers,

in a roll call of loyalists to the scrum.

Breathing not a word, a bird, a plane. The

weight of ulterior personae. Magnanimously

queued, in a march of the non sequiturs,

manning the breaches with the optimism

of the ill informed, as to the depth of the

valleys. The assimilation of toads into

the fairy tale.



Philip Byron Oakes

First review of Kent Johnson's 'A Question Mark Above the Sun:Documents on the Mystery Surrounding a Famous Poem "By" Frank O'Hara'

http://pearlblossomhighway.blogspot.com/

Excerpt from the review:

The question he seems to be asking is not so much, "Did Frank O'Hara or Kenneth Koch write the poem?" as much as it is, "Why is it important to attribute a work of art to the name of an individual artist and to protect that name as a sign of artistic genius?" and "What, exactly, are they trying to protect?"

It returns us to the kinds of questions Kent has been asking publicly for years about the ways in which poetry hierarchies function and how coteries of friends, or alumni of prestigious east coast universities, or poets of a certain generation and/or geographic location, protect their own, while simultaneously claiming an objective and innocent love of great art, regardless of its source. These are often questions of class and race and gender, though I think Kent is more interested in the functioning of power qua power, less about its specific manifestations

Please, Please, Please (to quote James Brown) -- Gil Scott Heron was never
part of the Last Poets and got real tired of people saying he had been.  To
add to the confusion, there's the "original Last Poets" and then there's the
later trio that went forward without Gylin Kain (sp?) -- [There was a group
of student poets at Howard in the late 70s that had the all time best name;
they were "The Next to the Last Poets"]

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" was first recorded with just drums
etc. for the album "Small Talk at 125th and Lennox Avenue" -- It was then
rerecorded with a larger band, and that second version is the one that got
lots of air play and became the stuff of legend.  It also appeared in Scott
Heron's first book of poems, also titled "Small Talk at 125th and Lennox
Avenue" --

These days students will need Norton style footnotes for damn near
everything in the piece, from "put a tiger in your tank" to "Whitney
Young."

Grade level?  "Teaching poetry":  reading?  writing?  criticism?  mnemonics
/ performance?

Are the biologists providing similar bibliographies to justify "teaching
biology" at the same grade level?  "Teaching biology":  plant and animal
identification?  dissection?  scientific method (really doesn't matter the
science)?

More usefully:  look at the learning academies model.  I would look at
models at level, not articles "for dummies."  If he is the administrator and
not an administrator.

All best,
Catherine Daly

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I knew there had been at least 2
configurations of LastPoets but i thot Gil SH had been in the earlier
incarnation. MEA CULPA. Okay, JB?

Is facism like racism,
except that yr prejudiced against certain faces rather than certain
races?

I was in Denver last year. Saw some faces that weren't great, I have

maybe The Last Poets got there first. Baraka did a few riffs along that lin=
e.

If rap could be traced to one logical source =0Apoint, this exceptional pie=
ce of vinyl would be it, without question. =0AThough the strict adherence t=
o syncopated rhythms and standard song =0Astructures are absent, all the el=
ements that would later become the =0Ahallmarks of hip-hop by the early 198=
0s (and predictable fare by the =0A1990s) are here: vivid depictions of str=
eet level violence, vivid =0Aapocalyptic predictions of racial genocide. Al=
l that is missing are =0Apointless party anthems. But running through all t=
he songs on the Last Poets'=0A debut is an urgent sense of the need for rad=
ical action in the nation =0Aas well as the black community. In addition to=
 railing against the =0Ainjustices perpetrated by white America, the Poets'=
=0A comment on the economic and social devastation of drugs ("Jones Comin' =
=0ADown," "Two Little Boys"), complacency in urban families ("Wake Up =0ANi=
ggers," "When the Revolution Comes"), the emotional release of sex =0A("Bla=
ck Thighs"), and the weight of oppression that leads to =0Ahopelessness ("S=
urprises"). At the same time, they warn of the dangers =0Aof half-hearted c=
ommitment to revolutionary change: "don't talk about =0Arevolution until yo=
u are ready to eat rats." In the same manner that Marvin Gaye's landmark al=
bum What's Goin' On depicted the problems that doomed black culture, the La=
st Poets=0A are now seen by many as prophets. But also like Gaye, the reali=
zation =0Athat the problems depicted on The Last Poets are now much worse m=
arks =0Athe record as an unheeded warning, far more than just a piece of Bl=

The Last Poets have been well served by the new generation. I've heard a gr=

Please, Please, Please (to quote James Brown) -- Gil Scott Heron was never
part of the Last Poets and got real tired of people saying he had been.=A0 =
To
add to the confusion, there's the "original Last Poets" and then there's th=
e
later trio that went forward without Gylin Kain (sp?) -- [There was a group
of student poets at Howard in the late 70s that had the all time best name;
they were "The Next to the Last Poets"]

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" was first recorded with just drums
etc. for the album "Small Talk at 125th and Lennox Avenue" -- It was then
rerecorded with a larger band, and that second version is the one that got
lots of air play and became the stuff of legend.=A0 It also appeared in Sco=
tt
Heron's first book of poems, also titled "Small Talk at 125th and Lennox
Avenue" --

These days students will need Norton style footnotes for damn near
everything in the piece, from "put a tiger in your tank" to "Whitney
Young."

With great pleasure to announce to the poetics list the availability of =
another book of poems!

Give Some Word is 90 pages of poetry. The collection traces a narrative =
of irreverence humor & beauty by foot across cities and mountains on 3 =
continents.=20


Now out from Shearsman, click for ordering, etc: =
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2010/kelder.html


A is for Accessible. Give Some Word is a somewhat irreverent book of =
poems. Kelder believes that people who read poetry should be delighted, =
not confused. Poems are not riddles. The poetry in Give Some Word is no =
exception; equal parts distilled language, contrary, and pushing =
everyday language out of conformity.=20

Some apparent influences; Carver, Brautigan, Corman, Sakaki, Lax, the =
Jargon Society and a hundred others. The collection includes work from =
publications over the past 10 years by Coracle, Longhouse, Blue Press, =
and many generous magazine editors.



On Using the Word =91Important=92=20
to Describe Poetry

I found some good poems,=20
faxed them right over=20
to a colleague of mine.=20
The boss came in and asked me,=20
=93What are these?
What=92s this all about?=94=20
=93They=92re poems,=94 I explained
=93I thought they were very=20
important, Sir,=20
and that as many people=20
as possible should see them.=94






What people are saying:

When I first read the first poems by Cralan Kelder before assembling =
what became Lemon Red, I had remarked to myself that in the best ones, =
he was a kind of urban Gary Snyder. Later, he showed me notes
written in the margins of the manuscript of some of  those poems, indeed =
by Snyder himself.=20
He had taken a class with him in California, and his comments were =
almost identical to what I had said about the poems. Later still, Synder =
denied ever meeting Kelder or writing about his poems.

Simon Cutts
__


Like Buddhist koans it makes no sense to try and unpick how Kelder's =
best poems work: they just do. The language, concept and experience are =
all one.=20

Kelder is a morning poet, he's up before the sun to make raspberry tea =
and politicise his croissants, hoping he'll be the next in line for the =
sun's address - after Mayakovsky and O'Hara - but in the mean time his =
delight is in sharing his observations (the autobahn, the finches) =
through his art. The clarity of his address occupies the place where =
language is thought, speech poetry where all pretence is stripped. These =
are real the poems of a poet drifting his mind over the domestic clutter =
of an ordinary day. =20
 =20
Chris McCabe

__

Cralan Kelder's writing is delightfully intoxicating and fresh -- his =
pungent perspectives enliven the world.

Naomi Shihab Nye

__

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Cralan Kelder does not employ his =
poems as armatures for hidebound rhetoric or as floorshows for =
linguistic acrobatics, but cleaves instead to immediacy=92s insistence =
with words and thought-tropes that sparkle like the many facets of =
everyday consciousness, in a teleological real-time that is both =
arresting and fluxional. Give Some Word gives us all that and more.

Mark Terrill

I once met the kind and tremendous poet Cralan Kelder. This was in =
Amsterdam. Let's go have a drink, said Cralan; OK, I said. We had some =
drinks at a bar, and then we went to a smaller bar and had some more. =
After this, we went to a bar that was even smaller yet, and we kept on =
drinking, and thus the night continued, in progressively smaller bars, =
until at some fantastical hour we sat there, facing one another, in a =
kind of tiny dark bar-closet that smelled of hashish, our knees pressing =
up against each others', our faces nearly touching. I felt by this time =
a bit disoriented and numb, but Cralan held forth, a true gentleman, =
laughing uproariously and discoursing brilliantly about Olson, Dutch =
poetry of the 17th century, dike technology, and whatnot. Let's go to =
another bar, said Cralan; OK I said, and so we went out into the dawn, =
and I wondered to myself how in the world there could be a bar tinier =
than the one from which we had just come. And as I was wondering this, I =
fell into a canal and began to splash about, yelling Help me, and that =
is the last I recall. Thank you, Cralan Kelder, for pressing your lovely =
mouth against mine, and bringing me back to life, in Holland.

but a couple of the blurbs made me wonder (carrie-style)

is(must) the praise of one (be) defined by the bagging of others?

australian poet dorothea mackellar invented a monalphabetic code for her di=

but outside this code she used swastikas to indicate menstruation (she seem=

The revolution is being televised; one just needs to know where to look =
for it. Right now, its ratings are not very high, but that's subject to =

My book of translation of the Turkish Poet Seyhan Eroz=E7elik=92s *Rosestri=

* *

*Seyhan Er=F6z=E7elik, ROSESTRIKES AND COFFEE GRINDS, translated by Murat
Nemet-Nejat*

Published by* Talisman House*



Available from SPD and Amazon:





=93In Eda: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry, Murat Nemet-Nejat
established =91eda=92 as a marker of poetic process much as Lorca=92s duend=
e or
the Japanese concept of yugen had ignited similar interests in the century
now behind us. The rootedness of mysticism in language, central to the
poetics in question, finds a true exemplar in Seyhan Er=F6z=E7elik=92s Rose=
strikes
and Coffee Grinds, a work of both intelligence & passion." =97*Jerome
Rothenberg*







 =93Could it be that Seyhan is actually informing us that in this world, wh=
ere
life is presented to us as if it were the reality of the past, present,
future and destiny (=91fate=92 or =91sorrow=92), there is in fact nothing m=
ore than
the surreal? It must be=97the surreality of fortune images and the allegory=
 of
the mediocrity of conventional fortune discourse, signifying life caught
between mediocrity and imagination.



With Seyhan, =91rose=92 is a savior: An icon that can be anything and overc=
ome
anything. An icon that provides redemption from being caught between
mediocrity and imagination! Seyhan attributes a miraculous, mystical (maybe
even divine?) power to the rose...



 The power of the rose, that shall transform us not towards doing
everything, but towards being everything. In Rosestrikes and Coffee Grinds
we see three paths: all of which are paths of the rose! In three spans of
time: the rose shall come along those paths.



And will bring us to itself...=94   =97*Hilmi Yavuz*







 =93Seyhan Er=F6z=E7elik=92s Rosestrikes and Coffee Grinds has three layers=
 of
narrative: first, the physical arrangements of rosestrikes and coffee
grounds that the reader never sees; second, the fortune reader=92s own
interpretation of these casual arrangements through words; and third, the
text that the reader simply encounters. All of these convergent layers unit=
e
in one point: what is said in the poem will be=85 the objective future of t=
he
anonymous other.=94    =97*Efe Murad*

The VERY first review of Kent Johnson's 'A Question Mark Above the Sun: Doc=
uments on the Mystery Surrounding a Famous Poem "By" Frank O'Hara'
http://habenichtpress.com/?p=3D550

Excerpt from the review:

"The text itself was perhaps best described by Owens during his recent visi=
t to Buffalo to see it through the final stages of printing =E2=80=94 he ca=
lled it a literary-critical Tristram Shandy. Indeed, Johnson so dramatizes =
the metanarrative of his thesis that this is the first book of critical inq=
uiry about which I=E2=80=99m afraid to say too much, for fear of giving awa=
y the plot. And it does have one, compleat with villayns and heroes.=20
The first of these emerge during the highly entertaining section =E2=80=9CC=
orroded by Symbolysme: An Unfinished Novella.=E2=80=9D The section fanciful=
ly details Johnson=E2=80=99s sojourns in England during various conferences=
, and his mysterious encounters with British poets intent on preventing the=
 publication of the original =E2=80=9Ctape essay=E2=80=9D by Tosa Motokiyu =
in which the alternate =E2=80=9CTrue Account=E2=80=9D authorship theory was=
 first proposed.

Back in May, and back when I was teaching a TOEFL test instruction class, I
would spend so much time preparing and teaching per week that my writing was
suffering. Then I came up with an idea. On the TOEFL test there is a
30-minute essay segment. Test takers have 30 minutes to write a 300 word
essay in answer to an assigned question. These questions are usually
somewhat mundane, i.e., one custom from your country you would share, . My
goal was to write at least 75 essays and to repurpose them. While doing
this, I also like I was sticking it to the powers observing us (Cameras were
placed in each room, for "quality control").

To cut it short: I have roughly 60 TOEFL (poetic) essays up  at my blog,
htp://charitablegiving.blogspot.com.

Check 'em out!

And thanks for reading!

Best,

Ryan Daley

Litteraria's online archive at http://issuu.com/litteraria has expanded,
with the addition of 14 more titles. Some of these titles are out-of-print,
while others are down to the last remaining dozen copies. If you find any of
these archived titles useful, please visit the LPB website at
www.litterariapragensia to see if the title is still available for ordering.

Coming soon to the web, the inaugural issue of VLAK magazine (contemporary
poetics and the arts). Only ten copies remain available. See
www.vlakmagazine.com for information about forthcoming issues.

To be released on Monday: DAVID LYNCH IN THEORY, ed. Francois-Xavier
Gleyzon, with contributions from Todd McGowan, Greg Hainge, Gary Bettinson,
Dominique de Courcelles, Scott Wilson, Alanna Thain, Jason T. Clemence,
Joshua D. Gonsalves, Rebecca Anne Barr, Louis Armand, Eric G. Wilson,
Francois-Xavier Gleyzon, Gary Bettison, Michel Chion.

"Francois-Xavier Gleyzon has brought together a brilliant set of critical
essays on the iconic hero of lost forms, David Lynch. Probing, fearless and
scrupulous, the volume stays close to the pained exactitude of an
unrelenting oeuvre, strongly supporting its troubled and abjected areas, the
glacial vocabularies and spectral prods that have made Lynch unbypassable,
necessary and enduring." --Avital Ronell, New York University

See http://litteraria.ff.cuni.cz/books/lynch.html for further information.

2011 sees the release of a series of new books, including critical studies
of Dusan Makavejev, Pierre Joris, James Joyce, David Grieg, Gilles Deleuze;
studies of English-Language Theatres in Post-Communist Prague and Prague
Poetics; an anthology of 20th century emigre poetry in Prague; fiction by
Thor Garcia; and poetry collections by Vincent Farnsworth and Laura
Conway...

hmm, agreed.=20

one clarification: by (bagging) do you mean bagging somebody as in =
getting somebody to write a blurb, or bagging somebody as in bagging on =
somebody?



the truth of the matter is that i was in painstakes addressing the whole =
blurb thing.
it's a trend in the publishing workplace and who am I to protest?

I couldnt quite bring myself to include the blurbs in the book itself,  =
so they are only here for your reading pleasure, and not in the book =
itself.=20
I figured that after badgering everybody to write one, the least I could =
do was use them somewhere.


none of my favorite (poetry) books have blurbs anywhere near them,=20

with the exception of Jargon Society books, with those irreverent =
brilliant observations by the master jonathan williams and what is =
written on the flaps of those books.=20

these particular blurbs below are meant to find a place in those veins


so, michael, what do you think a blurb should do? Im sure this =
discussion has been here before (?) I just wasnt around at the time to =
read it...

I suppose the ur-source would be Ecclesiastes 12.12: "Of making many
books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh."

hi cralan

its something of a vexed issue .. i try not to take it too seriously .. tho=
 i like to collect particularly cool things people say .. in my head at lea=
st .. [ er yes - about my poems] .. i think it can help get a book some att=
ention=2C & im happy to oblige a publisher .. it can help orient a book in =
its poetic-cultural place etc esp if yr trying to distribute internationall=
y .. these are obvious things to say ..=20

by 'bagging' - i dont know if its australian vernacular or uk/us but i mean=
t - basically - insulting -

what i referred to is these comments:

"poetry where all pretence is stripped"

"does not employ his poems as armatures for hidebound rhetoric or as floors=
hows for linguistic acrobatics"

im just expressing my dislike for critics having a generalised swipe - esp =
when that is not the task at hand .. &=2C just asking - is it possible to d=
efine (again in naive sex & city fashion) its (a book's) positive attribute=
s=2C without referring to what its not

i see a lot of that here & am sensitive to the thought that (something like=
) 'linguistic acrobatics' might refer to my poems (& whats wrong with that?=
) .. whats wrong with pretence?=20

in the poem quoted re the importance of poetry - u seem to be having a go a=
t a certain kind of stuffy critical discourse which seems (totally) fine wi=
th me ..

to be clear - im not bagging you - or even blurbing - just that strain with=
in criticism ..

As many of you know, there have been some difficulties regarding the
distribution of Works and Days of the Feneon Collective--and the publishers
anticipate continued delays filling orders for the time being. We're working
to make the book is available as soon as possible and appreciate everyone's
patience. Queries regarding order status can be directed to me at
possumego@gmail.com/. I'll make another announcement here as soon as the
Effing Press website is back online.

The frontiers of a book are never clear-cut: beyond the title, the first
lines, and the last full-stop, beyond its internal configuration and its
autonomous form, it is caught up in a system of references to other
books, other texts, other sentences: it is a node within a network.   --
Michel Foucault

Thus I discovered what writers have always known (and have told us again
and again): books always speak of other books, and every story tells a
story that has already been told ....        -- Umberto Eco

Perhaps I wasn't accurate enough. The phrase  I'm looking for is to the
effect that books inspire other books. I'm looking for the quote and the
author.

Cormac McCarthy from a 1992 NY Times interview: "The ugly fact is books are made out of books," he says. "The novel depends for its life on the novels that have been written." His list of those whom he calls the "good writers" -- Melville, Dostoyevsky, Faulkner -- precludes anyone who doesn't "deal with issues of life and death." Proust and Henry James don't make the cut. "I don't understand them," he says. "To me, that's not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange."

hi michael,=20

yes, the same in the vernacular where i come from - bagging means to =
take a dig at somebody.=20

I think you are right - taken as a whole, the poem excerpted & the =
quotes take a swipe at inaccessible poetry. That was not consciously the =
intention when putting this together, but now I read it the same as you.

The poem quoted is bagging on poetry books that are described as "an =
important contribution" on the back cover. There is more bagging in the =
book too; on prissy signs, war-mongers, cars, roadkill, etc.=20
Obviously there is a lot more going on in the book too, but there are =
definitely undertones of contrariness.


I would agree with you that positive sentiments are in general more =
preferable. It may be bad form to define yourself by differentiating =
negatively from others.=20
and yet I come back to the book's poetic bent; to write pieces that may =
appear simple on the surface & do not confound.=20

it also has to do with my literary heroes, writing that makes me excited =
- unpretentious straight-forward writing that appears simple, until you =
try & write like that yourself.

The blurbs / quotes and critical tone are my responsibility in the sense =
that the authors who wrote the blurbs are picking up on my sentiments =
towards inaccessible poetry.
The discussion gets interesting for me now, as I realise that what you =
say is true, that this particular book is also many years in the making; =
a reaction to a lot of poetry i read in the past 20 years, so that the =
reactionary nature of the blurbs is perhaps accurate

i would hope for it to be more of a positive reaction to the styles that =
I like, as opposed to just bagging on what didn't speak to me.


So to ask the next logical question: isn't writing poetry a reaction to =
the reading that has gone on before - and don't we incorporate our likes =
and dislikes in what we write & omit?

It depends on how you want to teach it.  For example, each institution in
the California CC and CSU systems must offer a course entitled "Women in
Literature" which was originally built around a pretty lame anthology of the
same name; NOW it is built around some weird Jungian-archetype approach.
 Luckily, people weren't forced to use the syllabus or bibliography, so some
writers who teach in the non-UC public system, like Leilani Hall, Kate
Haake, and me, are able to teach really innovative courses that follow the
general description.

It seems as though you're in the same situation -- that you can use whatever
you want.  I always choose source texts over anthologies, or more than one
dover anthology over a fat one, because they are inexpensive. Of course at
least 1/2 the course is going to be things in the public domain, so you can
choose which free ones you want your students to use.

So how ARE you teaching it?  Burlesque?

I always used literature and art made by women as a limiting factor.

All best,
Catherine Daly

I thought it might be interesting to reflect on how we're finding the iPad
as a development platform regarding our latest digital fiction project
'Changed', bearing in mind that we're not using the Apple SDK or exporting
an App from Flash CS5 to produce this piece...

NHL BRAIN TRINKET
by Jim Andrews
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=565
What I'm going to tell you-I warn you-is of no consequence whatever. And it
won't even be of interest to you unless you're an NHL hockey fan. And,
worse, it's going to test your algebra skills. The only thing I can say in
favour of saying it at all is that you just won't ever read anything else
about hockey like what I'm going to tell you right now. It just doesn't
happen. This is the unicorn of hockey writing. Right here, right now...

SHOES RED AS WOUNDS
by Christine Wilks
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=556
For my performance of Underbelly in Edinburgh, UK, on Halloween at Inspace
no one can hear you scream I intend to wear shoes as red as wounds. Why?
Because Underbelly, my work of playable media fiction, is an exploration of
women's bodies in relation to the land - past and present, inside and
outside, above and below ground - and shoes, especially red ones, are loaded
with associations...
NOTE: Underbelly won the Poole Prize for New Media after Christine posted
this.

 *We'd be grateful if you would please forward this letter to other
institutions and persons who might be interested in participating in this
event.
*


* * *Freedom for Liu Xiaobo*

*The internationales literaturfestival berlin appeals for a signing of this
letter and a worldwide reading on 20th March 2011 of the =91Charter 08=92 a=
nd
the poem =91You wait for me with Dust=92 by Liu Xiaobo, Nobel Peace Prize
laureate for 2010. *

Liu Xiaobo is currently the world=92s only winner of the Nobel Peace Prize
still held in detention. In 2009, after co-authoring =91Charter 08=92, a
manifesto calling for greater freedoms and democracy in China, Liu Xiaobo
was sentenced to eleven years in prison on a spurious charge of =93inciting
subversion of state power=94. His continued imprisonment is a basic breach =
of
human rights, and also a violation of China=92s own constitution where Arti=
cle
35 states that =93Citizens of the People=92s Republic of China enjoy freedo=
m of
speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of
demonstration=94.

1936 was the last time neither the winner, German journalist and pacifist
Carl von Ossietzky, nor any of his family members, could go to Oslo to
collect the Nobel Peace Prize. They were all barred from leaving Nazi
Germany. This historical comparison should disturb the Chinese government

China has made extraordinary economic progress over the last few decades.
The country is now the world=92s second largest economy, and a powerful pla=
yer
on the global stage. China is rightly proud of these achievements, but it
should also value democracy.

The preamble to =91Charter 08=92 states that =93*Chinese citizens are becom=
ing
increasingly aware that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal
values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, and
constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of
modern politics. A =93modernization=94 bereft of these universal values and=
 this
basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of
their rights, rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. Where i=
s
China headed in the 21st century? Will it continue with this =93modernizati=
on=94
under authoritarian rule, or will it endorse universal values, join the
mainstream civilization, and build a democratic form of government?*=94[i]

Now is China=92s chance to take a magnanimous step towards democracy. China
can do this immediately =96 by showing pride that one of its citizens, Liu
Xiaobo, has received the world=92s greatest award in recognition of a strug=
gle
to uphold human rights. This award should be an honour for China, too.

In 2005, Liu Xiaobo wrote:
=93*Didn't they say that China was in a golden moment of historical peak, a=
nd
that the state of human rights is at the very best?Didn't they say that the
present government wants to treat "the people as the foundation" in order t=
o
build a "harmonious society"? Then why is the government which has built th=
e
golden and almighty China so panicky? Why in this "harmonious society" in
which "the people are the foundation" are I and other dissidents treated
like trash to be stomped upon?  Why must the "harmonious society" be
constructed only with police officers posted at stations?*=94[ii]

It does not befit a great country to denounce the Nobel Peace Prize, expand
the restrictive security net around a peace laureate to include his friends
and relatives, and persuade foreign diplomats to boycott the prize ceremony=
.
Since the prize announcement, there has been no let-up in the harassment of
Liu=92s family and supporters, and all others attempting free speech
activities in China. Liu Xiaobo=92s wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest.
Several Chinese human rights activists have been prevented from leaving the
country in case they go to Oslo, and Liu=92s brothers are pessimistic about
their chances of being able to travel in his place.

Chinese citizens make up one fifth of the world=92s population. Liu Xiaobo=
=92s
case is not the story of one man: he is a symbol of the aspirations and
treatment of 1.3 billion people.

The call for worldwide readings of =91Charter 08=92, and Liu Xiaobo=92s poe=
m =91You
Wait for me with Dust=92, signify support for the campaigner, and a call fo=
r
his release from prison.

A courageous activist all his life, Liu Xiaobo once wrote that =93*in a
dictatorial country, open letters signed by individuals or groups form an
important method for the civilians to resist dictatorship and fight for
freedom*.=94[iii] And so we, citizens of the world, sign this appeal =96 so=
me
with our names, and many, many more with our voices, which will be raised o=
n
20th March 2011 to read Liu=92s words =96 and show solidarity with him, and
others in China, who are not free to say what they want.

We will continue to speak up until there is an end to the unjust
incarceration of Liu Xiaobo, and others like him.


*To sign this appeal, please reply to this email before 1st of December 201=
0,
giving the following information:*
* *
*Name*
*City*
*Country*

*The appeal, together with a list of signatories, will be published around
the world on 10th of December, the day of the Nobel Prize ceremony.*



We welcome all participants and ideas for the "Freedom for Liu
Xiaobo"-readings to be held on 20th March 2011. If you would like to take

He seems to need to create a background for the over-the-top violence in his
own work. Interesting that no female southerners (Eudora Welty, Flannery
O'Conner (who wrote with a fair amount of close-in violence)) make his cut.

Part of the power of McCarthy's writing is the ruthless way he sticks to his ideas. He does not wander. It does not surprise me that he reads that way too, although Melville does a great deal of wandering.

i couldn't help laughing at the quotes from cormac mccarthy--
the two most predictable possible of al writers for a writer wishing to be
taken as a tough guy to put down are--proust and james--
who, with their complex styles, for the most upper class characters,
"effete" psychological approach and "decadence"--are often setup as
stereotypes of everything the tough guy writer is NOT--as a "man" and as a
writer--
(after all, part of the stereotype is that Proust and James are--one gay,
the other often thought to be --
-- a kind of "manly" homophobia is considered to be "healthy & necessary"
for the kind of image mr mccarthy is deliberately trying to project here--)

Many thanks Carol Dorf for your comments re the violence in Flannery
O'Connor & Eudora Welty--
one could add Carson McCullers to this list--

i also liked the insight,  noting the "close-in" violence in O'Connor &
Welty (and i wd add McCullers--)--as last night i saw reruns of the old dick
cavett interviews with Alfred Hitchcock and the director, using the way that
the shower scene in "Psycho" is shot and edited using 78 close in pieces of
film to create effects that no long shots nor long held shots can
create--that is, by bringing the eye of the viewer, the presence of the
viewer, close-in right into the shower and next to the knife the curtain,
the water, the tub, he tiny fragments as seen close in of the woman's
body--this creates the effect of "being there" that makes the scene so
effectively horrifying and violent, makes the viewer feel so violated in
terms of its being "close-in" to the viewer also--"as though you, too, are
there"--

no offense to mr mccarthy who is a greatly admired writer as it is--but his
pose in the quote is such an already old nostrum--reeking of way too many
boozy such statements have heard since a kid and first ran into from the
mouths of the junior hemingway's and bukokwsi's--

actually re the strangeness of james that mccarthy notes--jorge luis borges
has a remarkable short piece re james in which he notes that he is one of
the strangest of al writers in terms of the subjects he creates--in fact
borges notes and lists the incredible range of new subjects and genres that
james came up with--noting also that james struck him (Senor Borges)--as a
denizen of Hell with an incredible sense of irony!--
(Hell being this world--)

"real issues of life and death"--if one defines such things as "real" only
if they are violent--
i have heard this argument also since kid--and wonder about it often--as i
live in the midst of a lot of violence and certainly a lot of my writing and
art work deals with violence of al sorts--
the argument being that violence alone guarantees a certain kind of
"authenticity"--
that violence is as it were, a more literally and figuratively "red-blooded"
dose of "reality" than anything else in human experience--
(hence the incredible proliferation and popularity of violent TV show of the
"reality" kind based on or recording crimes, prisons, cops, forensics, etc--
or
as the Tru Channel puts it, to top reality shows-!!--
"NOT REALITY. ACTUALITY"-
which has lead me to write some things re what exactly are the boundaries
separating "reality" from "actuality" when one is dealing with the
"docu-drama"--
seriously--i think it is a once a hilarious and a metaphysical/philosophical
question, and in terms of creating art works with these things in mind--
what ways might one come up with to present these "differences" beyond the
semantic levels, the catchy phrase "appearance"?--

mr mcarthy's statements--as "stateMEANTs" say--re writing and ciolence--i
think about often as my own life and writing are in midst of, are often
"concerned with/about"--violemce and its relationships now only with
"reality" of "life and death" but the imagination in relation with
these--which as a writerof fiction--mr mcarthy is involved with as much as
with the "real life matters of life and death"--how the "reality/actuality"
and the "fictions" the imaginations--of these--
so--what about this question of "authenticity" when one is dealing with it
in terms of,as, fiction, as works of "power & the imagination" as William
Blake puts it----

after all, if one is working in fiction and dealing with "real life"
"matters of life and death"--is that what/why Mr M "needs to" as it
were--stake a claim for "authenticity"--becuase there is a fear that
"fiction" somehow is NOT "authenticate" enough wihout resorting to
violence?--and, the more violent it is, the more "authenticate" itis?--i
think about this question becuase obvisouly the fictional violence in the El
Colonel stories are of a different kind than the "actual" violence with
which i am familiar--and even the pieces i have written which use a lot of
the violence i have experienced, witnessed, first hand--the question seems
not to be the "authencity" or the need to assert a pose that they are
somehow "more real" because of this--but what questions arise are ones more
of the nature of the means which one uses to express these, and the
realization just how much the imagination does enter in--and how much it
must enter in for mr mccarhy--this makes the question of the "strange" which
mr mccarthy finds so necessary to note--an interesting one in terms of why
it is certain subjects, genres, are associated with certain tones, styles,
of writing--and so, are supposed to "rule out"as it were, anything "strange"
to them--instead of investigating how one might not make use of a as many
possible forms of the "strange"--including al manner of forms of
"estrangement" to wreak violence on the forms themselves which are supposed
to, apparently, in mr mccarthy's statements, alone be qualified to present
violence in an "authentic" way, that is to say, as "real life" matters of
"life and death"--
if one approaches the question from this point of view--then what mr mcarhy
is saying is that ceratin genres of writing, certain ways of thinking about
"life and death" have to be protected as it were, from the "strange"--
in a sense, the author feels the need to "protect and defend" the Homeland
of his particular form of writing, his particular way of presenting himself
as a writer, his especial kind of reader and reading--
in this regard one might do wel to turn to the famous essay by Raymond
Chandler on "The Simple Art of Murder" in which he presents the differences
between the British form of the detective story, the British--and
British-influenced American--forms of detetecive and crimes and ways the
detective goes about solving the crimes--as opposed to the American Hard
Boiled School/Style/Genre, which grew out of the early Pulp magazines such
as the Black Mask, in which writers such as Mr Chandler and Dashiell
Hammett, Cornell Woolrich aka William Irish, David Goodis, Chester Himes,
Jim Thompson ad gloriam first began publishing and defining the style and
genre, (as well as those writers influenced by them such as James M Cain,
the Faulkner of the early novels and The Wild Palms & the early William S
Burroughs of Junkie &  writers in Europe such as the  Camus of
L'Etranger)--Chanlder develops very succinctly his theis and winds up
creating--for his onw fictions--the  paradoxically Romantic and Arthurian
Romance influenced image the "tough dick" known as Philip Marlowe who "down
these mean streets must go"--(btw Henry James was one of Chandler's own
favorite authors--)--this brillaint piece by Chanlder presents an eampleof
the complexity of the at first apparently "vioent and crude" distinctions
between the British style and what Chanlder rightly knew to be a compeltley
new form of writing, yet one which he links in matters of his own sense of
morality to the kinds of writing which Mr M finds "strange"--
the point being that the creation of writing dealing with violence and "life
and death" etc in a "red-blooded" way can draw as much on the "strange" as
on any kind of writing and writers--
hence the question re the Homeland Security attitude Mr McCarthy re
protecting from the "strange" "life and death" matters in terms of writing
and writing-
which brings one back books being created from books--why it is that a
writer might want to assert that in creating certain kinds of books one can
draw on only certain kinds of previous books and writers--
just as in certain forms of poetry writing various forms of the "strange" in
terms of subject matter, influences, writers, styles, etc--need to be
excluded and so be "protected from" as it were--implying a certain kind of
Terror at work--making one wonder why this "needs to be"--not simply the
"anxiety of influence" so much as the sheer Terror of the influence,
contamination by, the "strange" however that "strange" is perceived to be--
the Terror implying in turn a Puritanism of sorts--the need to "purify the
language of the tribe" in ways not always consistent with hose envisioned by
Mallarme in his famous statement--
the irony being that a "tough guy" pose as writer and as forms of
writing--should be Terrorized--
in which case Mr McCarthy's statements might be extended in considering all
manner of literary "wars" and "battles"--"quarrels"--in which case a
considerable violence does ensue in connection with protecting certain
forms, certain genres, certain writers, certain conceptions of the Author,
of Writing, of Poesy, Poetics etc-because they for one reason or antoher
feel threatened by what is considered "strnage," "different" in the
particular context--often revealing a kind of contradiction between concepts
of "contestation" when finding  themselves contested--
in a way the, the fear, the Terror, of the contamination of the "purity" of
a genre, of an author's conception of themselves and so on--extneds to a
fear of change--a desire to maintain a status quo--within various "literary
bounds"--literally * figuratively


last week while i was in the midst of working on yet more pieces in my"El
Colonel" series (the latest appearance of which is, from yesterday, at
Jerome Rothenberg's poets and poetics blog--this is part one of three which
is appearing there, with the next one to have some links to other pieces and
a note appended to it by way of a little "background" to the series--wd be
glad to share with anyone interested a bibliography of all the pieces so far
--9 or 10 now--on line which compiled for Jerome Rothenberg as a reference &
background as the being of El Colonel and the styles, forms of writing of
the pieces--are not static, are rhizomatic and so are not linear in order,
nor are of a "character" nor related with an "author" in any usual sense of
these----)
poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com
--
while writing away with El Colonel--my then apt mate entered with someone i
didn't see--and within moments--this was way past curfew--sounds of violent
sex exploding through the walls--just as i was dialing the manager my apt
mate burst in my room screaming "call the muthafuckin police! i've been
stabbed !!! and robbed!!"--a slow night here for once--so six squad cars two
ambulances and a fie truck arrived and loads of uniformed men and women
pouring into the tiny apt--as the tale was slowly sorted through via the
varying accounts my apt mate gave it became apparent that he brought home a
six foot tal two hundred plus pound man dressed as a woman in blonde wig,
tight pants bright orange jacket and high leather boots with
heels--apparently my apt mate's "thang
being such companionship and according to the ops the bar--i used to go
there in late afternoon unadvertised as no longer legal "happy
hours"--during relapses while living at the adjacent now closed down red
cross place for homeless--where my apt mate had gone being after midnight a
hang out for cross dressing gay male prostitutes--learn something new
everyday  as it were --fortunately the stab wounds requiring only about four
stitches, being short and superficial--al the same my apt ate turned out to
have some crimes against his wife of quite some violence, so off he went to
prison and hospital while the cops started their search for the man in the
blonde wig --
just a week or so before these events i had been walking down the street to
store to get some smokes and saw two men run up behind another--and
"cap"him--shoot him down--and run away--on my way back from the store about
five minutes later--the body stil lay in the street--no police as yet--and
some persons in various buildings' windows peering out carefully from behind
drawn blinds--

that particular street and lock in the last months has been the site of many
shootings, often, as the one i witnessed was, in broad daylight--

reading the cormac mccarthy quote i thought of these things as in re my own
writing which mixes violence and poetry scenes, questions, questions re
writing which obsess el colonel who himself lives in the midst of violence,
guerrilla war fare, counter insurgency etc--
and creates writings which particpate in the non-materilizationof writing,
as something which emerges and yet is also part of the "Writing of the
No"--compostions which emerge ouf ot decomposition, death deay--
and, given that many of my non-el colonel stories are about actual events
witnessed through the years of primarily drug related violence--(as the
shooting most likely was--)--(the events in the apt were booze related as
after the final police photographer had left a good near two hours after the
actaul ten second long event--we found in cleaning up a huge bottle of
brandy--and the meeting of the two men had taken place at bar--)--
thinking about these reading cormac mccarthy's quote--
again, i come back to the notion expressed by the writer that there is
somehow more "authenticity" to be gained by the depiction of violence than
there is in the writings of a proust or james--who are "strange"--
as certainly thereis much violence in both those writers' works--the
violence being simply of different kinds than the direct physical sort for
the mos part--though as i recal--(my memory may well be fualty here as is
some time ago i read the book--)-- le Baron Charlus participated in
sado-masochist events that ceratinly included physical violence of a
particalr kind--yet--as torturers know--psychological violence can be every
bit as extreme as direct physical assault--and so the charcters in proust
and james often undergo severe degrees of violence--
which in turn makes me wonder--knowing little about mr mccarthy--how much
violence has he experienced in hislife and of what kinds, how muh
witnessed--how many people seen actually killed?--(without being in a war i
have seen roughly a dozen/dozen and half through the years dispatched by
means of violence--some at the hands of the Law too for sure--)--
i wonder about it becuase many writers who have not necesarilywitnessed
violence create incredibly violent scenes--and write a great deal about the
maoral universe of violence, the psychological cosmos of this--and to very
great effect--that is, they makeone think about the QUESTION, QUESTIONS
which violence raises every moment in every part of the world--

my wondering & point  re McCarthy--which means i have to now go read his
books, really,-- and read interviews etc to find out for myself what he is
abt--is simply why fall back on such hackneyed claims as he makes, why feel
the need to strike the tough guy pose by picking out all the old stereotypes
and "usual suspects"--with al the implicit homophobia on display?-and al the
usual claims re kinds of "authenticity" in re "questions of life and
death"--
it seems to be a question more of genre than an individual--that is, to fit
the bill so to speak of a writer of violence, one "has to ""distance
oneself" from the worlds of writers like proust and james--(who in turn are
associated with being read by certain "types" of readers, "effete
intellectuals & esthetes" etc--yet further stereotypes denoted as
"strange"--)--

and, in turn--as Carol Dorf points out--to distance oneself from the world
of "women writers" who are in fact every bit as tough as any hard boiled
writer i have read, which is going some as i devour that style of writing--
it raises the question of to what extent does "genre" "determine" the
"author" as "critical iterary thinker"--
--implying, in turn, that perhaps writers like proust and james would NOT
read writers like McCarthy due not only to their being "strange" but to the
genres of fiction they work in being themselves "strange"--
again, authors considered in terms of their genres, which in turn are
determinates of the "actual" ("NOT Reality. ACTUALITY"!!--)--being and
thought, "lifestyle of the writer"--
using these elements, might one not then create a whole new form of literary
criticism and thinking re writing and writers based on the 'PROFILING" of
both genres and writers!
a kind of "War on Terror" re literature in which the "terrorists" are the
"strange" writers and "strange" forms of writing, "strange genres"--complete
with levels of "Terror Alerts" marked out in color which has been done with
eprson to be sure in the most horrific ways--badges and stars of differing
colors denoting various "
profiles" of persons--the "look" of "Muslim" persons which "proclaims them"
as "suspects" to be detained, renditioned--and that way of looking which in
Arizona----completely arbitrary, subjective, relative--which somehow
announces to the Law--or a "concerned citizen withe power to make a
citizen's arrest"--that they are in the presence of an--or more!!--illegal
alien or aliens-- )
--
bringing one back to the kind of "Terror" which mcarthy expresses in reverse
as it were of various kinds of writers, writing, readers and readings-
and that somehow this Terror is what makes the particular writers, form of
writing and readers and kinds of readings--like himself and his
readers--"TOUGH"--and concerned with "real matters of life and
death"--becuase they are as it were--on the front lines of the "War on
Terror"--
defending the Homeland against "strangeness"--
because this "strange" form of writing and writers,or reading and
readers--is not "like us"--not "TOUGH on--take your pick--crime, drugs,
terror--all those elements which along with poverty which the USA has
declared itself to be at war with, to be making war on--
of course-- i am exaggerating and making much ado about a smal quote--but
having heard for eons it seems the nearly exact same statements as those
McCarthy is making--one can't help but sense in the statements themselves a
kind of over the top exaggeration which for some reason "seems necessary"
for this particular author, working in a particular genre as it were, to
make--
and which, to stay against charges of being "anti-literary"--mentions
authors who usually are noted in these kinds of assertions as ones who do
use violence and are concerned with "real matters of life and death"--are
consdiered, especially Dostoevsky, to be to some degree
"philosophers"--"myth makers" and the like--
it's intersting to see inthis regard through time which authors have been
chosen to represent "real matters of life and death"--as i remeber "Dost"
and "Hem" Bukowksi wrote a great deal about in his early stories, esp in
Notes of a Dirty Old Man--
all of which goes to show how vast literary cosmos are opened in just a few
simple statements--how with a few swift storkes--whole terrains are lit
up--of literary criticism, literary history, questions of genre--how even
the bellicose assertions of a kind of literary equivalent a barroom brawl
provocation--"go to show" as Kaetrs wd say ho much may be made of a
dminished thing, hey!--
or that is, perhaps not so much a diminished thing as an attempt to make of
certain forms of literary and human "strangeness" a "diminished thing"--

David,

To explore further your brilliant comments on the relationship between
violence, authenticity and strangeness (to which I would add the dimension
of time):


On the one hand, one has the aestheticising or sentimentalizing of violence
in certain movies (Brian de Palma, Tarantino, etc.) or war propaganda (war
as heroism, political speeches, murder as justice, etc, etc.) or where
violence gains a certain rhetorical familiarity, normalcy. On the other
hand, there is the instantaneousness of violence, as in the case of your
apartment mate. It is this suddenness of violence, so matter of fact (only
four stitches) which is so strange, devoid of rhetorical palliation because
there was no time. (Even the most terrifying earthquakes only take a few
seconds.)

What I am talking about here is the banality of violence (subjectively
witnessed or undergone) which is strange. In Alain Renais's movie on
Holocaust images, *Night and Fog*? there is a very revealing shot: people
who were being carted to concentration camps were moved to the trains in big
procession on public roads. In this shot, along with the procession of
people being moved, one can see ot)her people (free?) carrying their
shopping back on their daily routines.

Both James and Proust explore, delve into that instantaneity. James's
baroque (effeminate?) sentences (k. Iskender's "post *naked lunch*/
panislamic/femininity" *souljam*) are attempts paradoxically to strip
perception of its rhetorical excesses, to reach a kind of authenticity, to
experience the the thirty second or so of an earthquake subjectively,
strangely, from the inside so to speak --to approximate that connection
between violence/dread and infinity. The same way, Proust's endless novel is
an attempt to stop the mechanism (familiarity) of time.

Ciao,

Murat
