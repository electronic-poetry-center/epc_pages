hi David Kirschenbaum,
i'm glad you decided to no longer steer clear of expressing yourself.

the reading i had mentioned about the Warren Wilson readers was
actually one of my first Project readings.  and that soured my romantic
young vision of the place, and its history.

but the truth is i did go to other Project readings after, Regie Cabico
included, and Regie of course was a lot of fun.  few poets can make
poetry as fun.  and there were other readings, some i liked, some
i didn't, whatever. =20

but the experience i was failing (it seems) to get across was
how i personally Feel at the readings since Anselm's taken over.
there's a (i'm going to say it) spiritual connectedness i hadn't ever felt
there before.  meaning the whole vibe with the tremendous introductions,
multiplying with the room filled with hungry ears, and the excellent
selection of poets.  poets we may or may not have seen prior to
the new Project scene, but nonetheless, it still would have been different.

one of the things i like very much is the great care that seems to be
taken with pairing the readers.  i don't think i'll EVER forget that night
of George Stanley and Peter Culley.  it wasn't just chemistry, it was
downright alchemy!  it was one of those nights where two different voices,
different in many ways, struck the highest possible chords together in
everyone in that room.  i remember all of us looking at one another with
genuine awe and Love for the poetry we had just taken in.

anyway, my whole point is, the Project as it is now ROCKS!
and i wish i had the fucking bucks to go up more often.

Actually, I caught that moment. He was reminding the born agains that he's
one of them--it's Christian love he was talking about. Elsewhere in that
anecdote he talked about praying with her.

I don't know the Poetry Project well at this point, and haven't read there
or been asked to read there for the past few decades. Years ago, I think
it was Ann Waldman would invite me from time to time; I did something with
Laurie Anderson and one or two solos (I think), also something with
Katchy Acker. I've always admired it.

That said, I believe any organization can be questioned in terms of who or
what they show - when I curated at Nexus or Image Film/Video in Atlanta or
out here in Brooklyn (with Nada Gordon and later Brenda Ijima), questions
would always come up. A place may be rocking, but for whom and by whom?
There may be 100 venues for reading in NY, but then all of them can be
questioned. I think part of the vitality of any organization is based
precisely on this questioning.

As far as public funding goes, yes that does mean a social responsibility
which I'm sure the PP definitely has. But even private funding, I think,
creates situations which affect the culture at large and the results are
open to questioning.

Maybe I'm more sensitive to critiques or take them a bit more seriously,
but the fact that almost everyone on the Poetics list objected to a few
objections seems problematic to me. Anselm presented the most succinct and
useful information of course. I'm just uneasy when critique is deflected
in the way it has been here.

There's another issue I want to bring up, which has also been considered
here - I think, even after these debates, we should be talking a bit about
what we're going to do if the fascists get four more years. The culture
wars are serious things, no matter how much we ignore them, and almost no
one seems to be planning on how to live in a right-wing future, if that's
the result. I keep getting reminded of Weimar, and all those German
refugees/survivors I met after the holocaust - all of whom, without
exception, said they never took what was happening seriously enough. In
the meantime I can only wait for the next NY terrorist act so I have
something to write about.

having been raised in captivity by Baptists (note the King David ref.) I did
indeed realize what he was TRYING to say -- but even in that context, it's a
bizarre comment -- I remember discussions of how hard it was to love your
enemies, but I don't ever before recall hearing that it was "hard work" to love
the widows of your soldiers --

I can't say I fit the label 'academic' either: I didn't have a university education, I'm unemployed and live in social housing (with
my cheap computer (!) ). I do chair poetry workshops (unpaid) and compere open-mic sessions but that hardly makes me a pedagogue.
People do make remarks like 'you read the books professors read' to me but, unless Leicester is a uniquely intellectual hothouse,
which I doubt, 'ordinary people', in my observation, take a much keener interest in 'intellectual/ academic' areas of interest than
is sometimes assumed.  I am thinking of taking up training to teach adults with learning difficulties basic literacy skills but
that's something I see as a kind of community service, not a foot in the door of academe.

A side-point about 'stret-cred':  it's conformity enshrined.

The books that Texas banned

Suzanne Goldenberg in Washington
Friday October 1, 2004
The Guardian

As first lady, Laura Bush made it a mission to encourage a love of
reading, but in her home state of Texas books are often viewed with
suspicion, including such classics as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Peter Pan.
In its annual review of state schools and libraries, the American Civil
Liberties Union of Texas this week identifies 62 titles that were removed
from school libraries during the 2003-04 school year following objections
from parents or teachers. Restrictions were placed on an additional 33
books, including George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, following
objections from the parent of a ninth grade student.

Here - as with most books banned in Texas last year - the reason cited was
inappropriate sexual content. Among the titles taken off the shelves were
two sex education books for younger children.

However, some books were banned because they touched on topics deemed
unsuitable for children, such as The Upstairs Room, the autobiography of
Johanna Reiss, who survived the Nazi holocaust by going into hiding.

The school in Waco said the book was removed because of strong language
and story content. Several books by and about African-Americans were also
banned, including Richard Wright's coming of age story, Black Boy, after
objections were raised to language and sexual content, and Alice Walker's
Pulitzer-prize winning novel, The Colour Purple.

Hi Alan, I've had a terrible day today and I shouldn't be writing to
anybody. But communication can bring to at least a little spark of
something. I have been literally killing myself with work, and this
moment of stasis is welcome. I like your irony here, not too many
people can go ahead and trick you out of things.

I met Laurie Anderson, and wrote an elegy for her on the Poets'
Corner, she was all right, even if I know she could have given more of
herself. But a gentle mind, kind and delicate. At least that is how
she showed herself. Which might all be part of the show.

I should see Maya Beiser tonight, if I am able to make it out of here,
take care, Anny

I don't know the Poetry Project well at this point, and haven't read there
or been asked to read there for the past few decades. Years ago, I think
it was Ann Waldman would invite me from time to time; I did something with
Laurie Anderson and one or two solos (I think), also something with
Katchy Acker. I've always admired it.

That said, I believe any organization can be questioned in terms of who or
what they show - when I curated at Nexus or Image Film/Video in Atlanta or
out here in Brooklyn (with Nada Gordon and later Brenda Ijima), questions
would always come up. A place may be rocking, but for whom and by whom?
There may be 100 venues for reading in NY, but then all of them can be
questioned. I think part of the vitality of any organization is based
precisely on this questioning.

As far as public funding goes, yes that does mean a social responsibility
which I'm sure the PP definitely has. But even private funding, I think,
creates situations which affect the culture at large and the results are
open to questioning.

Maybe I'm more sensitive to critiques or take them a bit more seriously,
but the fact that almost everyone on the Poetics list objected to a few
objections seems problematic to me. Anselm presented the most succinct and
useful information of course. I'm just uneasy when critique is deflected
in the way it has been here.

There's another issue I want to bring up, which has also been considered
here - I think, even after these debates, we should be talking a bit about
what we're going to do if the fascists get four more years. The culture
wars are serious things, no matter how much we ignore them, and almost no
one seems to be planning on how to live in a right-wing future, if that's
the result. I keep getting reminded of Weimar, and all those German
refugees/survivors I met after the holocaust - all of whom, without
exception, said they never took what was happening seriously enough. In
the meantime I can only wait for the next NY terrorist act so I have
something to write about.
- Alan

I'm extending the deadline for Red Giant to 10/8. Please email if you have
any questions. (adeniro@rocketmail.com)
________________________
Red Giant will be a one-shot chapbook, a mini-anthology, of speculative
poetry and poetry informed by science fiction, with an emphasis on work
from experimental and innovative practices. It will be published by the
Press of the Taverner in November 2004.

Speculative poetry cuts a wide swath through a many different traditions
(or anti-traditions) in disparate writing communities, including both
science fiction iconographies in popular culture and the language of
scientific disciplines. Whether the poetry's roots--in subject matter or
processes--are in A Scanner Darkly or The Crystal Text, Tiptree or Prynne,
killer androids in role playing games or cybernetics, space opera or
quantum mechanics, it's all pretty much fair game for Red Giant. Emphasis
will be placed on work that eschews linearity, storytelling-in-verse, hoary
formalism for its own sake, and simple "what if?" punchlines. The subject
matter matters less than the linguistic speculations themselves.

Contributors will receive three copies.

Email or print submissions are welcome. Email submissions to
editor@taverners-koans.com, with "Red Giant submission" in the subject
line. Poems can be snail mailed to:

Alan DeNiro, Editor
Red Giant
PO Box 28701
St. Paul, MN 55128

No reprints. Simul. submissions ok if notified immediately after acceptance
somewhere else.

For the public record, Beverly Dahlen and Peter Gizzi both read wonderful
work for the SF State Poetry Center last night at the Unitarian Center.  Bev
is (indeed) writing again (after a lapse of several years of apparently
reading, going to galleries, following birds in walks in the Delta, up and
down the coast.)
(Anyone wanting Beverly's  A Reading (1-7), Momo's Press 1983 or so, please
e-mail me. $15 including postage. I also have a few copies of the signed
first book, Out of the Third, for $25 including postage.  Charles Alexander
- I am sure - can fill out the details on how to get her most recent book
from Chax).
In addition to the poetry, Peter Gizzi gave a fascinating Spicer lecture -
contextualizing the language strategies of the poems in the context of the
50's and 60's, giving special focus to Assemblage & Funk art of the West
Coast, and  showing Bruce Connor's JFK assassination flic, "The
Report"(title ?).
He also spoke of the new treasure trove of Spicer materials that Robin
Blazer has gifted to UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library. But Kevin Killian -
Gizzi's fellow associate - I guess one does not say 'grave digger'! - can
report on what they have found so far, including poems and critical essays
they consider extraordinary, never previously published. Wesleyan,
apparently, will be doing a four volume series of complete works, letters,
essays, talks etc.

& then Peter also played wonderful tapes of Spicer reading from his works.

What a day - Gizzi on Spicer, Kerry capping Bush, and Bev Dahlen back in
action and Gizzi also up there singing it out.  Nothing relieves like a
little refreshing pluralism in a nation under these neocon-evangelical
f'ups.

Seems like people are - at least momentarily - sighing relief all over the
place.

Hi Aldon:

You hit it right on the head: our President who believes God called
him to be president, was transmitting directly last night to his core
constituency -- the religious right.

And we'd do well not to underestimate him. He's careful. Knowing full well
he
must appeal to some sense of center to secure reelection, he spent his time
last
night double-coding us, veiling much of his religious message from
outsiders. It
was all there last night-- biblical references, allusions to hymns, psalms--
all the
specialized vocabulary was there.

And we should have seen it coming: he learned it well, when in 1988, he
served as his dad's liason to the religious right. And it was a few short
months
before this that he had his born-again conversion. Back then, he and his
allies
began to chant a mantra: "Signal early and signal often". Unlike
Episcopalian
Bush the Elder, the son took all this to heart. His prime scribe has helped
him
craft a strong religious subtext, stealthful enough to fly below the radar.

Yes, this is a leader who describes losses overcome through hope,
steadfastness, and faith. This is a leader who refers to New York City's
rebuilding as a  "resssurection."

So, today, when in his stump speech, he says: "I believe that America is
called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century", I might ask "Called
by whom?" And, as I ask that question, I fully realize the code's not being
beamed to me.

I think he meant that doctors who specialize in women's health do so because
they love women. Nothing wrong with that. It's his clumsiness with language
that's the problem here. And for someone whose every word is parsed, this is
a serious problem indeed. On the other hand, Clinton was _too_ crafty with
his language. What we need from our political leaders is honest language
well said.

U.S. Denies Visas to 65 Cuban Scholars Planning to Attend an Academic Conference
By SARA LIPKA

All 65 Cuban scholars who had planned to attend an international
conference of the Latin American Studies Association next week in Las
Vegas were informed on Tuesday that their requests for U.S. visas had
been denied.

The conference is held every 18 months, and on previous occasions the
U.S. Department of State has refused to issue visas for some Cubans
who sought to attend. This is the first time that the entire
delegation has been turned away since the first Cubans participated in
the conference, in 1979.

Representatives of the association, which is commonly known as LASA,
expressed frustration that the State Department had announced its
decision so close to the date of the conference.

"Those of us who are suspicious say that it's not by accident -- it's
simply part and parcel of making the process as complicated and as
stressful as possible," said H. Michael Erisman, co-chairman of the
association's Cuba section and a professor of political science at
Indiana State University. "But that's just a conspiratorial theory."

Mr. Erisman had visited the U.S. Interests Section in Havana last
November to "work out a procedure which we hoped would avoid any of
these kind of last-minute crises," he said. The Cuban scholars, who
were told that their visa-application process would take approximately
three months, applied as early as April for this month's conference.

In May, Marysa Navarro, president of LASA and a professor of history
at Dartmouth College, and Milagros Pereyra-Rojas, the association's
executive director, met with officials in the State Department's
Office of Cuban Affairs, in Washington.

"We were given every indication that decisions would be made on the
merits of individual cases," Ms. Navarro said in a written statement
issued on Wednesday.

Mr. Erisman said he believes that the Cuban scholars' visa
applications "were pushed upstairs, and the decisions were made at a
higher level than would normally have been the case." When the Cubans
learned of the blanket denial, they quickly informed their U.S.-based
colleagues, and both groups sought explanations from the State
Department.

Those inquiries were met with different responses, said Ms. Navarro,
asking a reporter, "What did they tell you?"

Steven L. Pike, a spokesman for the State Department, blamed the
problem on the Cuban government of Fidel Castro.

"Restricting access of Cuban academics to the United States is
consistent with the overall tightening of our policy," Mr. Pike said.
"Our policy is not about restricting academic exchanges or freedom of
expression. It is the Castro regime that does that through restrictive
issuance of passports and exit permits only to those academics on whom
it can rely to promote its agenda of repression and
misrepresentation."

In denying the visas, the State Department cited a 1985 proclamation
by President Ronald Reagan declaring the presence in the United States
of Cuban-government employees "detrimental to the interests of the
United States." (All professors are public employees in Cuba.)

LASA officials said they planned to protest the department's decision,
"but I think all of us know that that's a long shot," said Mr.
Erisman.

Meanwhile, at least three conference panels in which the Cuban
scholars were to have participated have been suspended. And the
scholars themselves must cancel and seek reimbursement for their
airplane flights, which were already reserved. Furthermore, the $100
visa-application fee paid by each Cuban is not refundable, a policy
that will create economic hardship for the professors, who earn
approximately $40 per month, according to Mr. Erisman.

One of the Cuban delegates, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that the scholars had spent up to a year preparing papers to present
at the conference.

"Suddenly, with this decision that we can't participate, all of that
is up in the air," she said. "We consider it an unjust measure without
rationale."

It's all code. After all this is a President who believes
he was called to be President.

Last night he was laser-beaming right to his religious right
core constituency.

He learned many, many years ago: " Signal early and signal
often."

HIs sole concern in Iraq -- so he insists -- is to spread freedom,
and in so doing this he serves the Almighty.

Many heard it last night. And many were terribly assured.

Rather less comforting is the realization that our Chief Executive is
selling his dubious war to the base (a corner) he's worked for years,
which he knows to be credulous, fiercely partiotic, and enormously
loyal.

I live in a beat-up old town in Upstate New York... I don't think
there's a day goes by I don't hear someone say: "I'm voting for the
believer!" And I also take that as code deployed against Kerry... as
a Catholic... and further back against his grandfather's hertiage. (I'd add
I heard the same code used when Sen. Lieberman was on the ticket
a few years back.)

As Charles Mingus said to a Town Hall audience many, many years ago, ages
ago
last night: "We got to get some wire-cutters, before they get us to the
ovens!"

Now, how's that for code?

Peace,
Gerald Schwartz

Apologies to all, it sometimes happens to me, I just change the
subject and send, as if the machine was able to know what I wanted,
that much it has become part of me.

For those who might be interested, I went to Maya Beiser's concert
with video projections by Anney Bonney (another AB), and Irit Batsry.
She is an interesting woman of a certain beauty, and was able to fill
the stage with her cello - dared to sing La Voce, a poem by Cesare
Pavese, put to music by Louise Andriessen. Her Italian was difficult
to follow, but the moment rose to pure poetry, forgive me for this
mannerism, but that is how it was. She introduced the piece with
humility and apologized for not speaking Italian, her effort was
highly appreciated.

Best wishes, Anny

And let's not leave Kerry's rhetoric unexamined either -- in relation to Iraq, he said "we will get the job done right" and shortly thereafter "I'm going to lead these troops to victory."  He also spoke of "hunting down and killing the terrorists wherever they are" (and presumably any civilians and children in the immediate vicinity, a la Ariel Sharon, who went conspicuously unmentioned in last night's so-called debate -- Bush and Kerry are of one mind in supporting the Likud anyway), as well as making a stirring affirmation, which is certainly historically correct if one takes into account American expansionism from the wars against Native Americans onwards, "No president through all of American history has ever ceded and nor would I the right to pre-empt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America."  Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

It seems to me that too many let their "anybody but Bush" feelings (they're surely not thoughts) blind them to Kerry's fervent beliefs in the necessity of the American Empire.  Must we always play variations on the "evil of two lessers" and obediently tail along behind politicians who don't share our values or convictions?  (Note: I was at the big demonstration in NYC right before the RNC, and Kerry signs were few and far between...)

But if want to take the easy way out, try Gotham Book
Mart--they always seem to have it.  I see no reason
why they wouldn't still carry R.T. after their recent
move from W 47th Street to E 46th St--I think 16 E
46th Street.

Â¡CONTRA LA GUERRA!
Calaca Press opposes the occupation of Iraq.




Event: Flor Y Canto (Art & Performances) at the (San Ysidro/Tijuana) Border

Date & Time: October 1st, 2004       6 â€“ 9 p.m.

Location:  San Ysidro Recreational Center
             212 West Park Avenue
             San Ysidro, CA. 92173

As you may, or may not know, this year marks the 10th year of the
implementation of Operation Gatekeeper, NAFTA, and the subsequent
Zapatista uprising.

Since the implementation of Gatekeeper, over 900 people alone have died
in the San Diego Imperial Counties of California.  The overall
militarization of the entire U.S./// Mexico border, including Operations
in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and California, has claimed the lives of
over 3,000 people.  This is equivalent to nearly one death per day with
the commencement of Operation Gatekeeper.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) consolidates us into a
new era of modern capitalism, better known as economic globalization.
Along with the abolition of Article 27 from the Mexican Constitution
(which secured communal land holdings), NAFTA succeeded in displacing
Mexican farmers and worsening the economic situation for a population
that already lived in [extreme] poverty.  For these reasons, the
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) emerged and continues their
struggle to this day.

Today, deaths along the border continue.  People of color are constantly
facing harassments, border patrol raids, and deportations.  Current
immigration policies are not only inefficient, but just serve to further
criminalize immigrant communities and people of color.  Ya Basta!

This invitation goes out to our visionaries, our storytellers, our
musicians, our poets, our photographers, our artists and any one who is
willing and able to share some music, words, images, thoughts, and
inspirationsâ€¦

We are asking for any artwork, instillations, and/or performance pieces
that are representative of Border Issues. All artwork and/or
performances are donation-based.  All artwork will be returned to the
artists.

I should have included one other book with my posting two days ago. This
one isn't new, but it's perhaps "new again," i.e. we
discovered several copies of our 1998 handmade chapbook by Rae Armantrout,
titled WRITING THE PLOT ABOUT SETS, which existed only as text pages
without covers. So we made new, hand-splatter-painted covers, for each of
them, and hand sewed them for a reading Rae just gave in Tucson. We have
exactly 8 copies remaining available for sale, at $16 each. The chapbook
consists of four poems, "Writing," "The Plot," "About," and "Sets," hence
the book's title. On the covers, in addition to the spatter-painting, there
is a label with title printed on Japanese red Moriki paper. Each copy is
signed by the author. 120 copies originally in the edition -- these final
available copies are unnumbered.

Please send order and payment to:
Chax Press
101 W. Sixth St., no. 6
Tucson, AZ 85701-1000

If you're paying full price and are in domestic USA, and you're OK with
"media mail" shipping, then you don't need to add anything for postage. If
you need Priority Mail's 2 to 3-day service in US, then add $4
shipping/handling. If you want UPS or other shipping or if you're outside
of the domestic USA, then please inquire via email to <chax@theriver.com>.

these codes work well even in the secular realm, though -- see AMERICAN JEREMIAD
and other works for a good discussion of the history of how this language moves
from pulpit to general, secular discourse --

Who can forget Reagan's misreading of Winthrop's "city on a hill" phrase?  or
rather his speech writers' miscasting of it -- I seriously doubt that either
Reagan or his writers had ever actually read the original (as I suspect there
are huge swaths of the Bible that our born again pres has never managed to get
through)

Yup, I read it. Probably enough information, and it doesn't require you to
violate any trust.

What was interesting was the mean-spiritedness of it--the waiting till the
last minute to reverse the decision. Castro in general lets people tour
outside the country, only occasionally witholding an exit permit. His
arbitrariness keeps people on their toes. This is considerably worse.

Alan S. is right...the culture war is a serious thing

I, for one, am convinced that Bush will win and think constantly of
what to do when that happens (for I fully believe that a Bush
reelection means a blank check for the administration and congress to
wreak havoc). These people are not going to stop until they've built
their fantasy land where racist, reactionary, corporate war mongers
build their foundation of some new feudalism. It's going to affect us
all because they plan to AXE all funding to social programs and turn
America into a nation of wage SLAVES. You think it's bad now...it's
about to get far worse. My health insurance at the job just increased
42% . The coffers are being filled because Bush has the money to
entrench his supporters, keep giving them a free ride (tax breaks,
etc.) so they keep feeding him what he needs to run the media machine
(Fox News) that's brainwashing middle America into thinking this
vulture is some kind of savior. It's time to get mean. These
Republicans got mean a long time ago and they're fighting a dirty
battle--that's how they've stolen their position of power. Everyone
that doesn't belong to the upper echelon of society (Bush's financial
backers) is nothing more than another commodity to Bush and the
white-collar, crooks that he calls friends. On every level these people
are taking away what America is and means. They are about to enact
Orwellian policies that will fence in the populace like cattle and I
have a real fear that it would be entirely possible for this
administration to declare martial law and repeal all civil liberties in
the name of "justice" and their war on "terror"...I'm still thinking
that I'd vote for anyone up there as long as we can get Bush, Rove,
Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Rice and Co. out of there...these people
are leading us on a path toward our own destruction. It's too late now
to look away.

There's another issue I want to bring up, which has also been considered
here - I think, even after these debates, we should be talking a bit
about
what we're going to do if the fascists get four more years. The culture
wars are serious things, no matter how much we ignore them, and almost
no
one seems to be planning on how to live in a right-wing future, if
that's
the result. I keep getting reminded of Weimar, and all those German
refugees/survivors I met after the holocaust - all of whom, without
exception, said they never took what was happening seriously enough. In
the meantime I can only wait for the next NY terrorist act so I have
something to write about.

1) It is a fantasy to believe that the mass of Americans are brainwashed,
unwashed automotons, most are culturally conservative this is a fact but
economic liberals. In the past in America progressive forces won because
they allowed people to be culturally conservative, while serving their
economic interests. Fighting for labor unions, higher wages, small business
and small farmers. But since at least the mid 1970's the Democrats have been
as beholden to major corporations as the Republicans, hence people vote on
cultural issues and the left loses

BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE SIMILAR TO REPUBLICANS

2) When you create a system of retribution that can be misrepresented BY
BIGOTS AND RACISTS you lose; the fact is the 78% of the USA is of European
origin and is 'middle'class. The programs that were created for ALL the
people, Federally Insured Mortgages, Social Security, Interstate Highways,
Medicare are wildly popular and sacrosanct. Retributive programs, Quotas
based on Race not Economic position, College Scholarships for 'minorities'
regardless of financial condition, Dams and infrastructure for poor states
and no help for high tax northern states Cities and more and more. The
reason the left wins in Europe is because they created a social safety net
for ALL people, everyone gets free education through University, everyone
gets free health care et cetera if our LEFT argued for this they would have
a REAL ARGUMENT with the Neo-Liberal right in the USA but today they

DO NOT HAVE A STRONG ARGUMENT BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

3) Don't believe that the RIGHT in the USA is so Demonic, they are
CAPITALISTS, they take advantage where ADVANTAGE can be taken and the LEFT
in the USA gives them the ability to do this.  THE RIGHT HAS NOT STOLEN
ANYTHING they have used the SYSTEM THAT EXISTS no one has changed that
system so until WE HAVE A MORE JUST SYSTEM then stop whining and win by
PLAYING HARD.
WIMPS DO NOT WIN IN THE REAL WORLD-

WE LIVE IN A SOCIAL DARWINIST EXPERIMENT-

4) THERE IS A REAL WAR ON TERROR and real murderious terrorists exist that
HATE THE USA. But the answer is not KILLING THEM it is removing their MONEY
by reducing how much OIL we use, KERRY SHOULD ADVOCATE THIS THAT WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN OUR BELTS TO STOP GIVING BILLIONS TO STATES THAT BACK TERRORISM. But
we also need to change the INJUSTICE that our system supports. WE NEED TO
REALIZE That our exploitation of the world results in TERRORISM and since
COMMUNISM is dead FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM has taken its place. Eliminating
injustice globally would hurt many of US on this LIST, most UNIVERSITIES are
invested in stocks in COMPANIES THAT ARE GLOBAL PIRATES like WALMART if the
GLOBAL SYSTEM really changed there would be allot less money for
professors and American universities that have large investments.  MOST
American Mortgages are FINANCED by Fannie Mae which invests in the
DEVeLOPING WORLD's pain.

IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM WE WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE ARE WE WILLING TO DO
THIS?

5) Finally we are ALL AT FAULT we suck on the TIT of AMERICA and our
ENJOYMENT OF THE SYSTEM RESULTS IN INJUSTICE WHICH LEADS TO TERRORISM.  IN
order to change the world we have to change the way we live and

WE WONT because we are Selfish.

Who Loves America?

by Mario Vallenza

Who loves America? This great land--with many problems to be sure--but
built on
ideals that must not die. That humans have certain inherent rights,
simply because
they are alive and part of this world. An idea with its birth in the
Age of Reason...also,
the idea of democracy--that we may freely elect our leaders. The
blueprint for this
nation of course being the US Constitution, which prevents robber
barons from taking
over and stealing these inherent rights. The ideals fought for in two
world wars, when
it became clear that America must fight or die. We find ourselves in a
far different situation
now, as our "elected" leader, George W. Bush and his followers are
attempting to do
away with a tolerant and free America to replace it with a
discriminatory and tyrannical
America. Those who stood by to watch the dismantling of America uttered
not a
word as their civil liberties were slowly stolen in back-room, midnight
congressional
sessions, they uttered not a word as their hard-won freedom was
replaced by
a strange blind idolatry to a leader who was supposed to be followed
without question
blindly, which contradicted everything this boy had been taught as a
child by the public
schools--that this is what happened in other nations (and thank god
we're not living
there) where oppression was the only rule of law, oppression and
perhaps deceit.
Nations without a choice...

(to be continued)

Here's another piece of visa folly. We're now fingerprinting all foreign
citizens entering the US (legally, natch). So my kid, bearing an
acceoptance letter to a Glasgow university, goes to the Brit consulate in
NY to get his student visa. He's done this before--he spent two years in
Glasgow earning a masters. This time it's different--he's turned down, they
don't believe he's really going to attend--just a ruse to get into
Scotland. But it's ok if he reapplies, which he does 5 days later and is
accepted. It's called payback, and it's happening a lot. And at the end of
the school year, instead of being able to extend his visa by mail within
Britain as in the past, he has to fly back to the states, go to the
consulate and do the whole charade again. This from our only significant
ally in Bush's war. Even our putative friends are mad as hops.

On the other hand, no telling what weapon of mass destruction some
unfingerprinted Scotsman might be hiding under his kilt.

I'm not saying it isn't payback, Mark, but UK govt is generating a lot of
this crap itself

It's a well-known fact that UK is such a wonderful place and anyone without
a Brit passport is so doubtful as to personality that the mere act of
turning up and asking to come in is proof of evil intent

It is a well-known fact that our social security makes it possible to lead a
life of luxury and that all foreigners want to take the money

On top of this there is now paranoia about people trying to blow us up

In part this UK copying USA at govt level but also a centralising and
authoritarian impulse in the govt and the country - we have more video
cameras monitoring us than anyone else, we have more mobile tracking devices
(i.e. phones) than there are people

I think it's more a combination of useless people making work and useless
people doing something / anything because they don't know what to do in the
face of a perceived threat

It's interesting they're doing it to a white english-speaking person

My feeling is: Get Kerry elected, and then we'll critique him to hell if he
continues this policy. But first, get Bush & Co.out of our face.

Hi Charles: As an  old fashioned book marketer, can I suggest to you and
anybody else announcing a book, that a small chunk of a poem ("maybe" think
movie preview, teaser, etc.) gives substance to the work itself.  No matter
the knowledge/reputation of the author, there is so much out and about in
the world via title and name, it's overwhelming. A piece of or complete
short poem is, at least, a foot-stopper in the psyche of the reader's door -
or the new variation of a gourmet cheese sample on the cracker at the
farmer's market.

I guess I am arguing, poems sell books, much more rarely, bibliography.

And the net makes it so easy to put up the work.

A fan de Chax!

That's an interesting way of putting it, Mark -- for some of us, there *is*
only +one+ Glasgow University -- not Strathclyde, not Jordanhill.

        At least Carlos is having trouble getting back into the *real*
University of Glasgow.

The conclusion to one student's Macbeth paper (or, why I love teaching):

"How the themes are related to life today is there are people in this world
who should not become leaders. The reason is they have evil hearts. A good
example is Osoma bin loden. We are all formal with him. He was the ruler of
Iraq and he just had an evil ear. He would kill people for know good reason.
Lady Macbeth and Osoma are very similar. They both liked being in the
spotlight and killing people for no reason and also have evil hearts."

For those of  looking for Rev fervor - and there were long lines here in SF
- be forewarned. This flic is visually beautifully - Latin American
landscape eyewash perhaps akin to "Days of Heaven" - and full of youthful
adventure (with occasional tinges of injustice and justice performed),
but it has nothing do much with exploring issues  "the mature" Che G (in
Cuba, in the Congo, in Bolivia).
How long will we have to wait to see a serious dramatic flic about the wages
of revolution versus the presence of the USA etc.  in Central America, Latin
America, variously around the globe, etc., etc. The aesthetic repression of
all that juice - in its diversity of angles - is probably going to continue
to escape us.
But again, I might me jaded, blind. It's helpful for people to come up with
suggestions - DVD titles that never made it to the screen but are available.
I'd like to know.
The duplicitous promo appeal of this film is too predictable. Everything is
so pretty.
In Mexico City during the summer I did see very intriguing and powerful
photos from a project exploring the Shining Path versus the Gov in Peru.
Film that we see cannot seem to get and explore there.
 Oh well, even Shakespeare had to fake it under the guise of antique news.

What I simply mean is this...Bush is the more evil option and must not
be reelected. I realize that to a certain extent Republicans and
Democrats are two sides of the same coin...the Bush regime however are
personal business partners with foreign interests on a level never
before seen. These people running the United States right now are
making a hell of a lot more money from their business dealings with
foreign interests than their gov't paychecks. Of course this is nothing
"new" but at what point are the decisions made by the neo-cons for the
good of the American people and at what point are these decisions for
the good of their friends, namely the Saudis? Bush Jr. is carrying on
the family business...the business of running America (into the
ground). They are selling off America with a smile. I do realize that
both Kerry and Bush have some distant relation to each other, i.e.,
we're all serfs still slogging along while ruled by the big money
families. We're all in different situations...I can safely say most on
the list here are not multi-millionaires who dine with world leaders.

It's pretty hard to deny the fact that we're living in a media blackout
with slanted news coverage of what's happening over there...shit, Fox
news is slanted so far right its the Army's official news source for
soldiers in the field...even the idiot defense department who's always
catching up realizes that there's no plan for Iraq and has said as
much...and everyone knows where our CIA "intelligence" got us...this
ineptitude is truly frightening...combined with a huge bankroll and the
biggest military industrial complex on earth and some good-ole-boy
swagger and we're in line for a chaotic bloody mess that all the
experts are saying could go on for at least the next 10
years......Kerry has no intention of pulling out, thus his  platform is
similar (to an extent) to Bush's ... the big difference is that Kerry
is not a fundamentalist sociopath...I'm no Democratic supporter...I'm
just very angry at Bush...

I fully believe his reelection could create a situation leading to not
only WWIII but economic desolation (i.e., depression) and
fundamentalist nightmare. They can all bunker down while chaos ensues
...what do they care? What these neo-cons stand for is contrary to the
only good things about the USA. What they tout as "homeland security" I
translate as meaning the beginning of a police state where all are
guilty until proven innocent.

Eliminating injustice will definitely hurt US corporate interests--that
is the point.

1) It is a fantasy to believe that the mass of Americans are
brainwashed,
unwashed automotons, most are culturally conservative this is a fact but
economic liberals. In the past in America progressive forces won because
they allowed people to be culturally conservative, while serving their
economic interests. Fighting for labor unions, higher wages, small
business
and small farmers. But since at least the mid 1970's the Democrats have
been
as beholden to major corporations as the Republicans, hence people vote
on
cultural issues and the left loses

2) When you create a system of retribution that can be misrepresented BY
BIGOTS AND RACISTS you lose; the fact is the 78% of the USA is of
European
origin and is 'middle'class. The programs that were created for ALL the
people, Federally Insured Mortgages, Social Security, Interstate
Highways,
Medicare are wildly popular and sacrosanct. Retributive programs, Quotas
based on Race not Economic position, College Scholarships for
'minorities'
regardless of financial condition, Dams and infrastructure for poor
states
and no help for high tax northern states Cities and more and more. The
reason the left wins in Europe is because they created a social safety
net
for ALL people, everyone gets free education through University,
everyone
gets free health care et cetera if our LEFT argued for this they would
have
a REAL ARGUMENT with the Neo-Liberal right in the USA but today they

DO NOT HAVE A STRONG ARGUMENT BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

3) Don't believe that the RIGHT in the USA is so Demonic, they are
CAPITALISTS, they take advantage where ADVANTAGE can be taken and the
LEFT
in the USA gives them the ability to do this.  THE RIGHT HAS NOT STOLEN
ANYTHING they have used the SYSTEM THAT EXISTS no one has changed that
system so until WE HAVE A MORE JUST SYSTEM then stop whining and win by
PLAYING HARD.
WIMPS DO NOT WIN IN THE REAL WORLD-

WE LIVE IN A SOCIAL DARWINIST EXPERIMENT-

4) THERE IS A REAL WAR ON TERROR and real murderious terrorists exist
that
HATE THE USA. But the answer is not KILLING THEM it is removing their
MONEY
by reducing how much OIL we use, KERRY SHOULD ADVOCATE THIS THAT WE
NEED TO
TIGHTEN OUR BELTS TO STOP GIVING BILLIONS TO STATES THAT BACK
TERRORISM. But
we also need to change the INJUSTICE that our system supports. WE NEED
TO
REALIZE That our exploitation of the world results in TERRORISM and
since
COMMUNISM is dead FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM has taken its place. Eliminating
injustice globally would hurt many of US on this LIST, most
UNIVERSITIES are
invested in stocks in COMPANIES THAT ARE GLOBAL PIRATES like WALMART if
the
GLOBAL SYSTEM really changed there would be allot less money for
professors and American universities that have large investments.  MOST
American Mortgages are FINANCED by Fannie Mae which invests in the
DEVeLOPING WORLD's pain.

IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM WE WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE ARE WE WILLING
TO DO
THIS?

5) Finally we are ALL AT FAULT we suck on the TIT of AMERICA and our
ENJOYMENT OF THE SYSTEM RESULTS IN INJUSTICE WHICH LEADS TO TERRORISM.
IN
order to change the world we have to change the way we live and

WE WONT because we are Selfish.

Steve, it's always so nice to hear from you.
always a pleasure.  glad you love your wife by the way.
nice to know you found someone to love,
give her my very best wishes please.

but you ask
am i whining again?  yeah.  call it what you want, fine with me.

you call it whining while i call it rage, and the poor need to be
organized in the rage right now.
and after all, if we get four more years of Bush, there
will be more of us than ever to take the stand we're poised to take.

in the last three years 1,000,000 more people in this
country have slipped beneath the poverty line.
45 million of us without health insurance.

to talk openly about making changes with the inequalities
of race and gender has never been more welcome in many circles.
and that's great of course.
(who knows what four more years will do for these changes)

but to talk about class, to talk specifically about the poor,
well, it seems many folks, especially for some folks on the Left,
it still seems best to talk about the poor in other countries.

yet at the same time
change has never seemed more possible, in this dark time.
but maybe a few million more need to slip first, we'll see.
whining for the poor,
CAConrad

I'm listening to a recording I have of Ornette Coleman at the 1994 San Francisco
Jazz Festival -- This was the concert where he introduced his work "Tone
Dialing" -- It was also the infamous multimedia concert that included a body
piercing act between sets --

BUT here's the question -- at the beginning of the second set, somebody recites
a fairly lengthy poem, explicitly thematizing "tone dialing" and even making a
reference to the body piercing act -- I can't quite recognize the voice and
don't know the poem -- I've been googling all day, and while all contemporary
accounts I've found on-line mention the body piercing, and the reaction of many
in the crowd, nobody identifies the speaker of the poem (who, I'm guessing, is
also the poet) --

were any of you by any chance at that concert?  or can anybody in SF find out
who that poet was?  I need to know for my on-going collections of jazz/poetry
performances --

Aldon - I was there - pierce by pierce. That overtakes the memory of most
else. Difficult evening, it became. Overcame the music.
I will ask a friend about the poem.

When American citizens start talking about how $8 an hour is below the
"poverty line," it's a sign that all common ground with the rest of the
world has been lost.

People complain about how Bush will cut funding to the arts. How many Iraqi
civilians, murdered by Bush I, starved to death by Clinton, and then born
brainless as a result of Bush II's DU shells were poets?

Jonathan, i'm glad you decided to finally stop buggering me on the
backchannel and come out onto the List.

you chose to backchannel me --as a favor you said--
(how sweet of you) to inform me that if i didn't yell at people they'd
be more likely to give me what i needed to publish, etc.

it's been made perfectly clear that the war in Iraq was about
--and always was about-- making money.  you can of course
have it both ways, to be upset about the destruction of lives
in Iraq for money, and instruct me at the same time in how to
be the polite monkey and beg for crumbs.  there is of course
no contradiction in this.  right?

you want it both ways, and you can have it of course, just don't
point the finger at me and tell me i'm the angry one, because you
seem pretty angry yourself.  which is good, it's good to be angry.
in fact, you'd have to be pretty damned medicated to not be angry
about the way things are right now.

Note about the Name (A Found Poem)

The correct Icelandic spelling
of the name is Snorri Sturluson.
Snorre Sturlason is the
modern Norwegian spelling,
whereas "Sturlusson" is
a corrupt spelling.

Since Sturluson is a patro-
nym and not an actual surname,
Snorri Sturluson should always be
referred to as either "Snorri Sturluson"
or "Snorri," never as
"Sturluson" only.

I hope you're right about money as the root of this particular evil. My own
sense is that the motives, at least on Bush's part, are far
worse--arrogance, self-righteousness, and unbelievable stupidity.

I'd love to be able to listen to the dinner convrersation these days chez
Bush Senior. Bush Junior's foreign policy has not only been disastrous, but
it's a pointed repudiation of his father's entire career.

I've known Mike Stevens for something over 30 years. The announcement
doesn't make clear that he's a New Yorker who's been living in London this
past decade. I tend to be very sparing of praise. Mike's novel The Brooklyn
Book of the Dead is astonishing--quite simply a masterpiece. And he's an
engaging reader. I wish I could be there.

thanks -- one of the people posting to the site where I got the recording was
also there, but couldn't remember who the poet was --

the piercing is not part of the recording I have!  I gather from the comments I
found on the web that the piercing interlude was not a success with a large
part of the audience -- I remember there was a performance artist who used to
go around piercing himself and then placing blood-soaked pieces of paper on
lines over the stage -- never saw it myself and wasn't entirely sure if I'd
want to

they started when I was born

they gave me a sky of autumn leaves
an upside down crystallized tree
& made of my universe a deserted land
tied me to the ground sent eagles to eat my hand
they accurately amputated my right brain & in the stereoscoped variations
of projected ceilings sent faces to force me to climb out of my cage
and they laughed & their laughs echoing in my ears
tension brought to an unbearable exhaustion
ropes dug into my skin cutting through flesh down to the bone
& still keep me alive in eastern thoughts of Suv's speeding lights
heading down the way flashing in & out of satellite towns

they teased the beauty they once had suffocating it in the thick folds
of their heavy selves

they tied themselves to the ground
painted their skies with leaves of fall
circumscribed their ways to narrowed phone lines
figures experiments & lies
sliced the earth in shares & directed tides
man made selves rattling under their own vaults
sleeking boldly with the nothing that to them belongs

PRESS RELEASE



'Dearest Saddam': New Playing Cards Address 'Iraq's Most Wanted' as
Lovers


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

How do we love the unlovable? Seattle-based poet Jeffrey Encke offers a
new, controversial installment in the year-old genre of "Iraq's Most
Wanted" satires, excerpting poems that address Saddam Hussein and his
supporting cast as though they were lovers.


Seattle, WA (PR WEB) September 11, 2004 - "Call me our generation's Dr.
Strangelove," jokes Jeffrey Encke, author of Most Wanted: A Gamble in
Verse, the latest installment in the year-old genre of "Iraq's Most
Wanted" satires. "In some sense, these playing cards tell the story of
how I learned to stop worrying and love Saddam."

Encke, a widely published poet and literary scholar, decided last
summer, in the wake of the hotly-contested decision to invade Iraq, to
write a series of poems to the "most wanted" figures featured in the
Department of Defense's "Deck of Doom," published April 2003. "I
originally conceived of the book as a collection of love poems addressed
to war criminals," he says, "an approach at once satirical and
appropriate to my objective of exploring the way human subjectivity
dissolves in language imbued with fierce emotion."

By the time Encke finished the manuscript in March 2004, he found that,
instead of love poems, he had rendered a collection of "metaphysical
lyrics rooted in a private language of anguish and despair." With the
help of Boston-based writer and graphic designer Vivek Chadaga, he
proceeded to develop his own deck of playing cards, excerpting lines
from the poems for each. "By presenting the verse on cards, I hoped to
emphasize the irony of identifying ethical judgment with gambling."


The face of each card in the casino-quality, poker-sized deck features a
unique design, blending such imagery as DNA autoradiographs,
phrenological diagrams, satellite photographs, x-rays, fossils, flora,
and hooded figures (including a modified Abu Ghraib abuse photo). The
back of each card depicts a reproduction of the author's hand with the
word "matlub," a rough transliteration of "most wanted," inscribed in
Arabic on his palm.

Most Wanted, at once a deck of cards and book of poetry with 8.0658 x
1067 possible permutations, differs from other species of Iraq's Most
Wanted satires in that it does not take an explicitly partisan view of
the Iraq conflict. Instead, alluding to the double meaning of the
expression "most wanted," Encke sets out to explore how objects of love
and hatred, whether American, Iraqi, Israeli, or Palestinian, are both
in some sense products of human desire.

The US Military's publication of the officially-designated Personality
Identification Playing Cards has given rise to dozens of parodies, most
of them targeted at the George W. Bush Administration, among them Bush
Cards, the GOP Most Wanted, the Deck of Republican Chickenhawks, and the
Bush Regime Card Deck. Such parodies have been particularly popular
abroad in France, Russia, and the UK.

0-9758578-0-0) is available for purchase from the author's Website (

About the Author

Jeff Encke was born in Pittsburgh in 1971 and raised in Seattle with his
three younger brothers and sister. In 2003, he completed his PhD in
English at Columbia University, where he had served as
writer-in-residence in the Program in Narrative Medicine in 2002. His
poetry has appeared in various journals, including American Writing,
Barrow Street, Black Warrior Review, Colorado Review, Cream City Review,
Octopus, Salt Hill, 3rd Bed, and Quarterly West. Encke has taught
creative writing and criticism at both Columbia and Richard Hugo House
in Seattle, where he currently resides, and will be delivering a paper
on the rhetoric of gambling and war criminality at the University of
Western Ontario in October.

Advance Praise for Most Wanted

"Encke takes as his titles the Iraqi names on the U.S. Military deck of
'most wanted' cards and sets them against lyrics of longing and despair.
The result is a willed confusion and questioning in which the elements
of the two landscapes, rendered in precise detail ('black salt,'
'oranges exchanged between tongues,' 'collars of stone'), overlap and
are conjoined. These are fine, visceral, tender, bitter, and truthful
poems."

- Hermine Meinhard, poetry editor of 3rd Bed and author of Bright
Turquoise Umbrella (Tupelo Press, 2004)


"Jeff Encke is going to get us all arrested. He has taken the current
war as an opportunity to express an erotic ('Who brought me to this /
this chair / engulfing my child's body, / to this bent position') and
Christian ('we speak openly of taboos, / keeping the heads of our
enemies closest, / and fresh') modern love that is eccentric, original,
and possibly traitorous. How do we love our enemies? Like lovers? Encke
walks a tightrope between empathy and promiscuity, using poetry as a
means of addressing love 'objects' who have not only become dehumanized,
but who have also carried out their own regime of dehumanization. His
poems are a primer course on how to stay human in a dark time."

- Tony Tost, winner of the 2003 Walt Whitman Award from The Academy of
American Poets and author of Invisible Bride (Louisiana State University
Press, 2002)


"Most Wanted plays an inspired, surprising set of riffs on the bromide
'Make Love, Not War.' Jeff Encke dares us to see the war of the human
heart as darker and more disjointed than the war of nations, the love of
war as simpler and safer than the love of people, and the power of words
as more intricate and uncertain than any military policy. The changing
script of love that emerges every time his pack of elliptic fragments is
shuffled and a new game of poetic poker is played helps to restore human
individuality, vulnerability, and contingency to a world in which we can
never wish to imprison whatever it is we most want."

 - Bart Eeckhout, author of Wallace Stevens and the Limits of Reading
and Writing (University of Missouri Press, 2002)

Subject:      Tanya Brolaski's new chapbook!
MIME-Version: 1.0

*       *       *
In our never-ending quest to make chapbook publishing sexy again,
Atticus/Finch is pleased to announce the release of its third volume:
Tanya Brolaski’s _The Daily Usonian_.

People, this one’s HOT! If you purchase only one chapbook this year by
a younger writer, do yourself (and us!) a favor and make it _The Daily
Usonian_. One part Sapphic delirium, three parts Delphic train wreck,
you simply won’t know what hit you, and you won’t want it to stop!
Brolaski’s first book stutters and stomps through Virgil, Dante, and
Katherine Phillips only to run head-on into Buffy’s “must see
vampires.” Here, “everything(’s) gone to helenback,” and there’s an
arrow through the heart to prove it. Brolaski’s a harbinger of
seriously catatonic states that WILL NOT disappoint.


Take note:

“my business is circumference”

I dreamt your Twinness.
There is an absolute
Sphere whence you fell.
Step ample, Emerald, fixed
To the spot
I saw you.
Trust my Curiosity
To Brook no further Argument,
And fortify my Gut w/ nearest
Heaven. And though the Lofty
Treaty stand,
I shall not wreck it.
Though delinquent Love
Is a force we hazard at.

-AND-

amorosa erranza

All my dark hardiments begin: so furious and so fell.  All disarrayed
in Love
I began to speak of Mariners.  And when I saw the grove divided into
double parts, which ways I took, diversely can I tell but can no ways
devise.
So in I entered was, and marveled at the wandering way.  Although my
leman, I am a wondrous doubt—tell me, ere I die of love—which way to
turn?  Your mouth is like a crescent moon your teeth are like
tombstones,
and all along the way even the labyrinths shuddered.  Where can I go to
powder my nose safely? Your address makes me feel intimate, yet I
undergo
the strangest beguilements, I become incredulous.


Stephanie Young writes of _The Daily Usonian_:

Here it is, all the news from the other side that you’ve been dying to
hear, whichever side you happen to be on momentarily. For there are no
sides here—no high, no low, no painted flats, no traveling through
time—instead, a poet and a poetry of immediate, endless repetition. In
this eternal present of thought, that is, style, I mean,
scholarship, “this crapshoot idée fixe and its yahoo mistress,” you’ll
need each fine hair that lines the path to your inner eat, that piece
of anatomy that assists when you listen to music or discern the
twilight from the twilight. It’s a derailed algebra or myriad
substitutions, the kind that requires second sight as the poet
iterates her vegetable love, the length of California, the length of
her arm, the cult of sadness. _The Daily Usonian_ is not afraid to use
the word in the definition of the word.


And Brent Cunningham:

My dear readers of blurbs, what does it mean when a book ranges so far
across differing language systems? Not everything in the world has an
idea under it, but here the argument is being made, in part how
significance, in the sense of illumination, must be found _wherever_.
In these poems it is not the era or even precisely the context that
matters, but the ability of a perceiver to pluck out, to remain
receptive and flexible, to listen beyond conditions. Brolaski’s poet-
perceiver sifts through ages of syntax, Dante and Buffy become
contemporaries, Counts and Ladies travel overland to fairs again, and
it is Feeling—revived out of its status as sentiment—that serves as
her Beatrice. “Not even the word love.” That is to say not the _word_,
but its selection, its occurrence in a field of evident intelligence,
my dear readers of blurbs.


These chapbooks are only available via mail-order, and they’re only
six bucks!


To order, please send well-concealed cash/check and a nice note to:

Michael Cross
Atticus/Finch Chapbooks
SUNY Buffalo

Buffalo NY 14260-4610


Atticus/Finch is committed to publishing important new work in elegant,
affordable editions (even by poets’ standards). This book sports
a “Balboa Blue” cover, on which you’ll find Sappho, jilted in love,
jumping from the rocks to the sea foam below.

Kind of Embarrassing (So It Can=D5t be All Bad)

This would probably have to be shortened & tightened to be called a poem
(And Expanded, and Loosened, To Be Called An Essay)

I=D5ve always felt a particular kinship with you aesthetically
in terms of the personality and values you put forth in your writing.
You were just like one of the guys with Greg and Brett and others and me.
You put me up for a few nights when my apartment had no heat.

Sure, we knew of your parentage, off in the distance for us,
and knew that somewhere outside our circle that would =D2matter=D3 to others
as privilege or tragedy, blessing or curse, but we didn=D5t want to make a bi=
g
deal out of it,
or even bring it up unless you did, and sometimes you did,
or sometimes we=D5d bring up our parents and compare differences in our
upbringing
to better understand each other, we=D5re were =D2at=D3 now, as well as in
aspirations
and, yes, you, like us, had aspirations.  No sense of resting on laurels,
whether earned or inherited, could corrupt a non-pejorative ambition
not simply for the self, nor even limited to the nest that babysat you back
in the days.

If the math of dread comparisons ever entered into it,
the blessing and the curse could easily equal out. So we=D5d move on.
We may wonder at differences, or at least I may,
when I consider my feeling marginalized from a community that is itself
marginalized.
I may content myself that two negatives make a positive, or realize that I
can be a friend with someone who is friends with others who are no friends
of mine,
and hope that he or she will not hold that against me.

There is no crime on either side, and nothing to forgive
if there is a connection between two people, however distant fate has made
them.
There=D5s a loneliness of isolations and a loneliness of being busy,
of being perceived as at or near the center of a bustling activity
that is taken as =D2more important=D3 but which also just happens to be
the no-heat apartment into which you were born (and well documented at
that!)

What=D5s strange, and perhaps even unimaginable, to many
was natural, and perhaps even normal, to you.
Perhaps you=D5ve felt (and justly so) you never had the privilege
of getting to rebel against a factory father, or speak for a silent victim
mother.
Perhaps you=D5ve felt that some have treated you disdainfully
as if you were President fucking Bush
and perhaps you were more acutely aware from an earlier age
of the discrepancy between worldly poet =D2success=D3 and a living wage.

Perhaps some others=D5 superficial sense of you goes against their rigid
notion of poets
As those for whom inspiration comes either anarchically, =D2from nature,=D3
Or those who reject such notions of =D2inspiration=D3 and learn it =D2from
school.=D3
Both of these may look with suspicion (or perhaps envy)
on one who was =D2home-schooled=D3  by at least three poet parents
especially if one=D5s younger sibling is also a poet.

It=D5s like they=D5re trying to force you into a position where you not only
have to defend your own existence, but also the fact that your poetry might
have things in common with the poetry your parents have written, as if the
only reason you like reading their work is because they=D5re your parents!
Either these folks have never appreciated the writings of your parents
(and I know some who like your work but not your parents=D5,
or your mom=D5s but not your dad=D5s, etc),
or they cannot see how your work is as much YOU as anybody else=D5s is his or
hers
(and in quite a few cases your work is more yours than others=D5 is their own=
)
But why should you have to defend the =D2family=D3
or others defend the =D2academy=D3  or =D2the street=D3 or =D2woods?=D3
Personally, I=D5ve found the words =D2family=D3 and =D2poetry=D3 to occupy almost
entirely opposed conceptual universes=D1but just because I personally have ha=
d
to make a choice between the two doesn=D5t mean anybody else should have to.
It may very well have nothing to do with the poetry.
And what of the word =D2community=D3?
Perhaps that word rings truer for you than it does for many others who
invoke it.
Often the invocations of =D2community=D3 seem cold,
but if one may accept that a filial love may somehow exist beyond, or prior
to,
the struggle for symbolic capital blah blah blahs which tend to infect so
many
attempts at utopian communities, and that that bond may be praised and
primal,
why would one reject the opportunity to find one who may appeal to such a
value
rather than say the mere tit-for-tat =D2conditional love=D3 that so often is
found at, or near, the center of most communities, whether =D2poetic=D3 or not?
And isn=D5t it possible that such values can be contagious?
So much shit to shake off the shoes, huh=C9..

Jesus, Craig, I understand your need to flail against straw men, but could
you leave me out of it?

I would never accuse you of being angry. You are petulant. Anger is what
happens when you recognize there are problems in the world bigger than your
own.

I don't think he was denying the bigger problems
of mutilations in Iraq

but isn't it possible that the "little" or "petty" problems
that a lower-class poet in America faces are
one with these global (or "bigger") problems?

That it's not an either/or question....
that the rhetoric of "privilege"
is often invoked by those who have a stake
in crushing any internationalist solidarity
of those who are, in differing ways, oppressed....

(oh gosh stop me before i sound like
a bumpersticker for "think globally act locally"
or "the personal is the political")....

Chris, we can't even begin to discuss these issues when the breadth and
length of the problems we see are what is happening to *us.* Assuming Craig
is working 40 hours a week at his $8/hour job, there are a number of people
on this list that have less money, myself included. I'm here in downtown El
Paso, and am simply rolling in wealth compared to tens of thousands of
people not ten miles to my south. No doubt there are many poets among them.

Certainly, the class structure (I can't even call it oppression) in America
is tied to the irradiation of Iraq. One can't understand the one without
understanding the other. Since I think we all understand the class structure
in America, why don't you and I, right now, commit to going to Iraq and
learning about the irradiation there. I'm game if you are. Let's set a date.

The conclusion to one student's Macbeth paper (or, why I love teaching):

"How the themes are related to life today is there are people in this =
world who should not become leaders. The reason is they have evil =
hearts. A good example is Osoma bin loden. We are all formal with him. =
He was the ruler of Iraq and he just had an evil ear. He would kill =
people for know good reason.  Lady Macbeth and Osoma are very similar. =
They both liked being in the spotlight and killing people for no reason =
and also have evil hearts."

It's people like this clown who will vote to re-elect Bush. Not evil but =
stupid.

This clown? =20

Perhaps the gentlemen (or lady?) simply isn't very interested in English =
and is, against their better judgement, slogging their way through a =
required English course? Perhaps they suffered through a series of =
egregiously underqualified high school teachers who, for any of the =
typical reasons, seriously imparied their ability to understand the =
importance of literature, to say nothing of its scope and recent =
history?  Or maybe - and I don't think I'm going out on a limb here - =
they wrote the paper under the kinds of undegraduate "duress" (lack of =
sleep, interest, time, etc.) that often lead to the muddled and unclear =
style of argumentation that Mr. Belz has so professionally cited for our =
private amusement. (Although, in our budding scholar's defense, =
"muddled" and "unclear" are precisely the words I would use to describe =
Mr. Bales' argument that bad paper writing leads inexorably to voting =
the straight Republican ticket.)  Or perhaps, if Saint Louis =
University's website (@ =
http://www.slu.edu/colleges/AS/ENG/ego/Spring2003.html) is any =
indication, this student isn't an undergraduate at all?  =20

Call me quick on the draw, but I can't help thinking that is is =
precisely why, on the one hand, English as a discipline is in such a =
wide-spread state of self-apparent decline and why, on the other hand, =
so much of the hand-wringing behind the "crisis in the humanities" is =
comically misplaced.  Should we really be surprised that most Americans =
opt not to read anything, let alone poetry, when someone like Mr. Belz =
confirms what so many of them already suspect, namely, that the literati =
are sniggering behind their backs while they dangle their participles, =
split their infinitives, appeal to Oprah's book club and scramble over =
the steep terrain that seperates the dilettante from the scholar?  =20

Shame on you, sir, and shame on the other members of this list who =
chortled right along with you.  It is an incredible violation of your =
student's trust that you circulated their work on the Internet simply to =
elict a few condescending guffaws.  Teachers like you are killing our =
discipline and I invite any member of this listserv to tell me why I =
shouldn't immediately contact your employers and urge them dismiss you.  =

Not Evil But Stupid

Everybody heard him, the smug man,
But still he spoke, smirking:
I am much further out than you think
And not evil but stupid.

Rich kid, he always loved drinking
And now he's President
It must have been too much for him his brain gave way,
They said.

Oh, no no no, it was too much always
(Still the smug one stood, speaking)
I was much too far out all my life
And not evil but stupid.

First, note that I don't argue at all, as Mr Radcliffe would have it,

that bad paper writing leads to voting the straight Republican
ticket. Implicit in my comment is the notion that people who don't
write well don't think well, and while there are some exceptions to
this generalization, I think that as a generalization subject to
those exceptions, it stands up pretty well.

Second, I said that people who don't think well will re-elect Bush,
not vote the straight Republican ticket. I have nothing against
Republicans, but I think that Bush's habits of mind are pretty clear
by his habits of speech.

Third, it was the confusion of the position of Osama bin Laden with
Saddam Hussein as the ruler of Iraq that most piquantly brought Mr
Bush to mind. His presentation of the war in Iraq has, and continues
to be, as Mr Kerry pointed out in the first debate, based on the
fraud that Iraq was significantly or importantly connected with 9/11
or Osama bin Laden or al Qaeda -- significantly or importantly enough

to go to war with. That has been simply and thoroughly discredited.
It is the confusion of the facts that the student put forward that
reminded me of Bush's confusion on the facts. A person as confused on

the facts as this student is is, I think there is little practical
doubt, likely to be willing to vote for Mr Bush's misrepresentation
of the facts.

Fourth, the pressures of being a student in college in the US are, to

be blunt, piddly. US college students are among the luckiest and most

privileged people in the entire world. All kinds of help is available

to any one of them, from special tutoring in general to more time to
study for a test or write a paper. The notion that a student who
writes so badly and so confusedly ought not to be laughed at is
absurd. Of course he or she should be laughed at -- and then helped
to see his or her confusion, and helped to think, and write, better.
But who among us is able to improve ourselves without admitting the
faults or flaws we would like to improve? None. It is the nature of
the beast that we must admit those faults or flaws before any
improvement may be made.

So much the worse, then.

They who? The literati who dangle, split, appeal, and scramble? No --

it is the "most Americans" whom Mr Radcliffe would have dangling,
splitting, appealing and scrambling, had he not stumbled over the
terrain himself.

That aside, though, the sniggering goes both ways, and righteously
so. The working classes mock the chattering classes, and the
chattering classes the working ones. So what? Mock on.

Fortunately for me, I suppose, I have no dog in the academic fight,
and can venture my opinions freely without worrying that Mr
Radcliffe, or someone like him, may have some say about whether I'm
employed or not, or whether I get tenure or not, some time in the
future. So let me just say frankly, what an obnoxious and shameful
thing it is to threaten another person with dismissal over their
expressed opinions, even when, or especially when, one disagrees with

those opinions. The question isn't what opinions are expressed, but
what actions are taken -- opinions count as actions only in some
instances, and this is certainly not one of those instances.

WORKSHOP BEGINNING TOMORROW NIGHT

Playwriting Basics, with Kurt Schneiderman
6 Tuesdays, October 5-November 9, 7-9 p.m.
$175, $150 for members

A weekly workshop open to novice and experienced playwrights who want to
develop their playwriting abilities through actual writing and in-class feed
back. Bring in new or old work to be read aloud and critiqued by everyone
involved in the workshop. Course will include readings from various classic
theatre texts and discussion of playwriting structure and theory. You can
expect to emerge from this course with some written and workshopped
dialogue, and with an introduction to the overall theoretical framework for
dramatic writing. Kurt Schneiderman is currently Dramaturg for the Buffalo
Ensemble Theatre, the coordinator of the annual new play competition at the
Area Playwrights' Performance Series, and Director of the new play, forum
Play Readings & Stuff. Named one of "Buffalo's emerging young playwrights"
by Gusto Magazine and Buffalo's "next A.R. Gurney" by Artvoice Magazine,
Kurt was the winner of the Helen Mintz Award for Best New Play (2003) and
was nominated for the Artie Award for Outstanding New Play (2004). Most
recently, one of Kurt's plays was chosen for the 2004 Toronto Fringe
Festival.

THIS WEEK IN THE HIBISCUS ROOM

Jimmie Gilliam and Rosemary Starace
Read from their Work
Friday, October 8, 8 p.m.

Jimmie Gilliam has published 3 full-length collections of poetry: The Rhyme
and Roar of Revolution (Friends of Malatesta, 1975); Ain't No Bears Out
Tonight (White Pine Press, 1984); and Pieces of Bread (White Pine
Press/Dream Seasons 1987). She taught English at Starpoint Central School in
Niagara County from 1956-1971 years and English and Creative Writing at Erie
Community College from 1971-1995. Now retired and still writing, she
currently lives in Amherst, NY.

Poet Rosemary Starace studied psychology at Hunter College; an interest in
psyche (meaning "soul") forms the underpinning of her work. Later she
studied at the New York Feminist Art Institute, finding there an approach to
art-making which reveled in process and called forth the riches of the inner
life. She completed an independent study master's degree in The Creative
Process in the Arts at Lesley University in Cambridge, MA. She currently
lives, writes, paints and teaches in Pittsfield, MA.

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work.  Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

FYI  - I suspect these 'offensives' in Iraq will be a regular item up until
our US election with "no more Fallujahs" as the cant, Karl Rove directing
military tactics, and many wounded Iraqi civilians angrily trying to figure
out a new definition for the English word "precision".

Girl Blog from Iraq... let's talk war, politics and occupation.

Baghdad Burning

... I'll meet you 'round the bend my friend, where hearts can heal and soul=
s
can mend...

Sunday, October 03, 2004
=A0
Samarra Burning...
The last few days have been tense and stressful. Watching the military
attacks on Samarra and hearing the stories from displaced families or peopl=
e
from around the area is like reliving the frustration and anger of the war.
It's like a nightmare within a nightmare, seeing the corpses pile up and
watching people drag their loved ones from under the bricks and steel of
what was once a home.
To top it off, we have to watch American military spokespersons and our new
Iraqi politicians justify the attacks and talk about 'insurgents' and
'terrorists' like they actually believe what they are saying... like
hundreds of civilians aren't being massacred on a daily basis by the worlds
most advanced military technology.
As if Allawi's gloating and Bush's inane debates aren't enough, we have to
listen to people like Powell and Rumsfeld talk about "precision attacks".
What exactly are precision attacks?! How can you be precise in a city like
Samarra or in the slums of Sadir City on the outskirts of Baghdad? Many of
the areas under attack are small, heavily populated, with shabby homes
several decades old. In Sadir City, many of the houses are close together
and the streets are narrow. Just how precise can you be with missiles and
tanks? We got a first-hand view of America's "smart weapons". They were
smart enough to kill over 10,000 Iraqis in the first few months of the
occupation.
The explosions in Baghdad aren't any better. A few days ago, some 40
children were blown to pieces while they were gathering candy from American
soldiers at the opening of a sewage treatment plant. (Side note: That's how
bad things have gotten- we have to celebrate the reconstruction of our
sewage treatment plants). I don't know who to be more angry with- the idiot=
s
and PR people who thought it would be a good idea to have children running
around during a celebration involving troops or the parents for letting
their children attend. I the people who arranged the explosions burn within
the far-reaches of hell.
One wonders who is behind the explosions and the car bombs. Bin Laden?
Zarqawi? Possibly... but it's just too easy. It's too perfect. Bin Laden hi=
t
the WTC and Afghanistan was attacked. Iraq was occupied. At first, any
explosion or attack on troops was quickly blamed on "loyalists" and
"Baathists" and EVERYTHING was being coordinated by Saddam. As soon as he
was caught, it became the work of "Islamic extremists" and Al-Qaida and
Zarqawi suddenly made his debut. One wonders who it will be after it is
discovered that Zarqawi has been dead for several months or that he never
even existed. Whoever it is, you can bet his name will three syllables or
less because that is Bush's limit.
A week ago, four men were caught by Iraqi security in the area of A'adhamiy=
a
in Baghdad. No one covered this on television or on the internet, as far as
I know- we heard it from a friend involved in the whole thing. The four men
were caught trying to set up some explosives in a residential area by some
of the residents themselves. One of the four men got away, one of them was
killed on the spot and two were detained and interrogated. They turned out
to be a part of Badir's Brigade (Faylaq Badir), the militia belonging to th=
e
Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. Should the culprits neve=
r
have been caught, and should the explosives have gone off, would Zarqawi
have been blamed? Of course.
I'm very relieved the Italian hostages have been set free... and I hope the
other innocent people are also freed. Thousands of Iraqis are being abducte=
d
and some are killed, while others are returned... but it is distressing to
see so many foreigners being abducted. It's like having a guest attacked in
your own home by the neighbor's pit bull- you feel a sense of responsibilit=
y
even though you know there was no way you could have prevented it.
I wasn't very sympathetic though, when that Islamic group came down from
London to negotiate releasing Kenneth Bigley. I do hope he is returned
alive, but where are all these Islamic groups while Falluja, Samarra, Sadir
City and other places are being bombed? Why are they so concerned with a
single British citizen when hundreds of Iraqis are dying by the month? Why
is it 'terrorism' when foreigners set off bombs in London or Washington or
New York and it's a 'liberation' or 'operation' when foreigners bomb whole
cities in Iraq? Are we that much less important?=20

"I discovered I couldn't go along, with the government or governments, with
radicals and certainly not with conservatives or centrists, with radical
poetics and certainly not with other poetics, with other women's feminisms,
with any f----g thing at all; belonging to any of it was not only an
infringement on my liberty but a veil over clear thinking." -- Alice Notley,

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer:



Differentials

Poetry, Poetics, Pedagogy

By Marjorie Perloff



A new collection of essays from a distinguished critic of contemporary
poetry.



Marjorie Perloff is one of the foremost critics of contemporary American
poetry writing today. In Differentials, she explores and defends her
belief in the power of close reading, a strategy often maligned as
reactionary in today's critical climate but which, when construed
"differentially," is vital, she believes, to any true understanding of a
literary or poetic work, irrespective of how traditional or experimental
it is.

"The only way to get at a poem, Marjorie Perloff reminds us, is to read
it, word for word, line by line. As we have come to expect, this book is
learned, provocative and illuminating, a joyful celebration of the
pleasures of the text, and a passionate argument for difference."--Peter
Quartermain, author of Disjunctive Poetics: From Gertrude Stein and Lous
Zukowsky to Susan Howe



"Differentials offers readings with a difference, discovering textual
difficulty as a source of pleasure and restoring to literary analysis an
excitement we had almost forgotten it might have."--Peter Nicholls,
author of Modernisms: A Literary Guide



Marjorie Perloff is Sadie D. Patek Professor Emerita of Humanities at
Stanford University and author of many books, including The Futurist
Moment, Wittgenstein's Ladder, Twenty-First Century Modernism, and The
Vienna Paradox, a cultural memoir.

Dear Lawrence- et al-

I just wanted to make clear that i didn't intend to mock that little
paragraph i posted.  Its author is a sophomore in high school.   I often
find student writing to be terribly strange, fresh, and shocking.  Sometimes
it's boring, but often it's just bizarre.  Bizarre like a monkey eating a
jonquil.

Kids rock,

Crown Conflict Raised in John Graham Case


Indigenous "The Supreme Court of Canada has dealt with this issue but
not in relation to a First Nations individual," Crompton said. "That has
to be addressed."


Crown Conflict Raised in Case

By charlie smith
The Georgia Straight
Publish Date: 30-Sep-2004

John Graham faces extradition for a murder he says he did not commit

Defence lawyers have proposed some provocative legal arguments to
prevent an East Vancouver Native man, John Graham, from being extradited
to the United States. Department of Justice Canada lawyers are
prosecuting the case on behalf of the U.S. government, which wants
Graham sent to South Dakota to be tried for the notorious 1976 murder of
Native activist Anna Mae Aquash. Her body was found in a ravine with a
bullet wound in the back of the head.

Shortly after Graham was arrested last December in Vancouver, he told
the Georgia Straight that he did not murder Aquash. Instead, he accused
the FBI of orchestrating a civil war between Natives on the Pine Ridge
reservation in the 1970s, which culminated in someone else murdering
Aquash. Graham claimed that the FBI wanted to frame him because he was a
member of the American Indian Movement.

At a B.C. Supreme Court hearing last July, a former member of his
defence team, Lyn Crompton, suggested that the attorney general [Justice
Minister Irwin Cotler] may be in a conflict of interest because he has a
"fiduciary trust" with Graham, a Native. At the same time, Crompton
said, justice department employees are working against Graham's
interests trying to have him extradited.

"The Supreme Court of Canada has dealt with this issue but not in
relation to a First Nations individual," Crompton said. "That has to be
addressed."

In addition, she said the court must examine whether or not it is
illegal to extradite the Yukon-born Graham because he is a member of a
First Nation that has never signed a treaty. After the July hearing,
Graham told the Straight that he is a member of the Houchai Lake band,
which is part of the Champagne First Nation.

A judge will determine if there is sufficient evidence to order Graham
to be committed to extradition. Once this occurs, Justice Minister
Cotler would make the final decision.

Crompton announced at the July hearing that after conducting more than
500 hours of legal research, she was quitting the defence team because
of a lack of funding. At a B.C. Supreme Court hearing on September 28,
one of Graham's other defence lawyers, Greg DelBigio, said that
Crompton's arguments are still under consideration.

"The most active thing I can say at this point is it's still a live
issue and being thought about," he said.

At the same hearing, another of Graham's lawyers, Terry La Liberté, told
B.C. Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Bennett that the defence team has
limited financial resources to advance these arguments. DelBigio later
said that the Legal Services Society has provided some legal-aid
funding, though he didn't offer any details.

Bennett told the defence lawyers that if they don't have sufficient
funding to advance their arguments, they should file a "Rowbotham
application". These are applications to a judge to stay the proceedings
until the accused person has sufficient funding to conduct a legal defence.

Bennett explained that as a result of a recent legislative change, the
Legal Services Society would be financially responsible if the
application was granted. Bennett added that she knows how many hours are
involved in researching the history of First Nations legal cases, and
she urged the defence team to find out where it stands with the Legal
Services Society.

"Ms. Crompton told me she spent 500 hours researching," Bennett said. "I
don't doubt that for a moment."

Last July, Crompton also questioned whether or not the 1999 Extradition
Act could be applied to Graham, who is accused of committing the murder
in 1976. DelBigio said it may also take three days for a separate
hearing to deal with disclosure of Crown materials to the defence.

Bennett scheduled a hearing for November 1 for lawyers to report back on
whether or not they planned to pursue Crompton's legal argument that the
Crown is in a conflict of interest. At that time, the defence could
decide if it is going to file a Rowbotham application.

In addition, a disclosure hearing is scheduled for November 15 to 17.
Graham's extradition hearing will begin on December 6.

Internet Text: Philosophy and Psychology -             10/04
                                                        (last was 11/26/02)

Recent work has been building on hardware software wetware outware issues,
especially the phenomenology of the virtual, motion capture, the current
political state of the nation; I have been moving into new realms of
representation in which body and substructure are mutually problematized.
I am also working on extending some theoretical work dealing with
cybernetics and (non) aristotelian logics.

===

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. Some URLs:
recent http://www.asondheim.org/
http://www.asondheim.org/portal/.nikuko
WVU 2004 projects http://www.as.wvu.edu/clcold/sondheim/files/
recent related to WVU http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim
Trace projects http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm
partial mirror at http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Wryting, to which
almost all of the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
partial or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

===

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 150 files, or 15,000
printed pages. It began in 1/1994, and has continued as an extended
meditation on cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures,
symptomologies of the edge.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short- or long-waves. The former
are the individual sections, written in a variety of styles, at times
referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are interrelated; on
occasion emanations are used, avatars of philosophical or psychological
import. These also create and problematize narrative substructures within
the work as a whole. Such are Susan Graham, Julu, Alan, Jennifer, Azure,
and Nikuko in particular. Most recently, texts are created which are
aligned with still or video images, texts which surround them as uneasy
allies, texts which speak for the silence of representation itself.

The long-waves are fuzzy thematics bearing on such issues as death,
sexuality, virtual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical
reality, computer languages, and protocols. The waves weave throughout the
text; the resulting splits and convergences owe something to dance,
phenomenology, programming, deconstruction, linguistics, philosophy and
prehistory, as well as the domains of online worlds in relation to
everyday realities.

Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectivity and its manifesta-
tions. I continue working on cdroms and dvd+s of my work, creating
samplers and live performances.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, vi,
CuSeeMe, etc., my work tending towards embodied writing, texts which act
and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of these emerge out
of performative language - soft-tech such as computer programs which _do_
things; some emerge out of interferences with these programs, or conversa-
tions using internet applications that are activated one way or another.
And some of the work stems from collaboration, particularly video, sound,
and flash pieces. Recent software used has included Blender, Gimp, Poser,
motion capture, Audacity, Cooledit, perl and awk programs, Calculon and
other Zaurus (linux) pda applications, and audio/video input from a
variety of cameras and other devices.

I have been working in collaboration at times, most notably with Azure
Carter, my partner, and Foofwa d'Imobilite, perhaps the artist/dancer I
feel closest to, in terms of concerns about exhaustion, injury, speed,
flight, politics, history of the body...

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

The texts are roughly in the order written; the last-entered at the moment
is ns. They may be read in any order, and distributed in any medium;
please credit me. I would appreciate in return any comments you may
have.

Dear Friends: hope you can join us.

A DIFFERENT SEPTEMBER 11: POESÍA 100%: Martín Espada,
Yusef Komunyakaa, Raúl Zurita, Mark Doty, Cecilia
Vicuña, Marie Ponsot & Cristóbal Bianchi with
Casagrande. Oct. 16 at 8 pm. The New School, Tishman
Auditorium at 66 West 12th St., New York City. $5
donation to Casagrande. Advance tickets: 212-229-5488.
Hosted by Rattapallax, New School Graduate Writing
Program, LouderArts & Terra Incognita. Hosted by Idra
Novey. More info at http://www.rattapallax.com


Poetry reading and video presentation. Before the
America's 9/11, there was another one in Santiago,
Chile when the dictator Augusto Pinochet used Hawker
Jets to bomb the Presidential Palace on September 11,
1973 to remove the democratically elected President
Salvador Allende. As a counter reaction to the
bombing, Casagrande, an underground literary
organization of young poets born during Pinochet,
rented a helicopter and dropped 100,000 poems on the
Presidential Palace on March 23, 2001. They followed
with a bombing of Dubrovnik, Croatia and Gernika,
Spain -- both cities bombed in the past. Learn more
about Casagrande.

Jonathan, first, i love it when people tell me to "leave them out"
after they came knocking on my door.

now i know you think you have my financial situation figured out,
but you really don't.  i have the cheapest rent i know of in Philly,
but more than half my month's wages go toward the rent.  and i
have no health insurance, and i bust my fucking ass every day
at work.  and no, i don't get 40, more like 34 hours.

i also have no sick days, and i was sick two days recently, and
now i'm behind on my rent again because my check was puny.
if this still sounds like luxury to you, then kiss my ass.

the problem with the power structure in this country rests within
this ongoing argument that the poor over here are whining, and
can therefor be ignored, and all eyes turn back toward
the Dow (the American Tao).

granted, at least i have job.  my friend Jeffery is a week from
living on the curb, but of course his friends (myself included)
won't let that happen.  but my mother and i lived in a car, and
that's life, and that's not luxury, and there's no way anyone can
tell me it was.

and i really don't give a shit if you call me self centered, but i hate
to work, i loathe it, every single day i loathe it.  i'd rather be at home
reading Craig Watson and Tom Raworth and writing my own.

call my petulant, angry, call me whatever you want, call me immature
like you did in your backchannel, fine, i take tremendous pride in
refusing to be grateful for this fucking evil economic tyranny.

Subject:      Bob Dylan Chronicles' quote!

Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

"He (Bob Dylan) writes about later in life disappointing a record producer
with new songs that didn't match the glory of his greatest: "I couldn't get
to those kinds of songs for him or anyone else. To do it, you've got to have
power and dominion over the spirits. I had done it once, and once was
enough. Someone would come along eventually who would have it again --
someone who could see into things, the truth of thing -- not metaphorically,
either -- but really see, like seeing into metal and making it melt, see it
for what it was and reveal it for what it was with hard words and vicious
insight." "

Joel Selvin review and quote from Dylan's new book, Chronicles 1, in today's
San Francisco Chronicle


Nothing like the fire of the Old Testament in a young man's bones. In light
of the drench of Rove media spin (i.e. Constant Lies), I find this so
refreshing, if not down right "blowing in the wind" nostalgic! Let's bring
it on John Edwards! Cheney, talk about old testament! Yeah, make him/it
Melt.

they're too real--apartments with terror

my dizziness isn't willful--it's a prelude

all hidden in the plasma--i can't do

Hello all! Apologies for the short notice; our email has been down for abou=
t
a week but is now working. TOMORROW:

October 6, Wednesday
Anselm Hollo & Basil King
Anselm Hollo is the author of over forty books of poetry and prose, and the
translator of more than thirty books from the Finnish, French, and German,
among other languages. His recent books include Caws & Causeries: Around
Poetry and Poets, Rue Wilson Monday, Notes on the Possibilities and
Attractions of Existence: Selected Poems 1965-2000, and a translation of
Pentti Saarikoski=B9s Trilogy (winner of The Academy of American Poets=B9 Harol=
d
Morton Landon Translation Award, 2004). Basil King began his long
documentary prose/poem/media work, Mirage, in 1992, parts of which have bee=
n
published as The Complete Miniatures and Devotions, Warp Spasm, and Mirage:
a poem in 22 sections, as well as in the magazines Otis Rush, Boxkite, Hous=
e
Organ, and First Intensity. King creates miniatures in many mediums and is
currently at work on his next book, Learning to Draw. [8:00 pm]

October 8, Friday
Free Radicals Book Party
A book launch and party for Free Radicals: American Poets Before Their Firs=
t
Books, edited by Jordan Davis and Sarah Manguso, and published by Subpress.
With readings by B.J. Atwood-Fukuda, Jim Behrle, Carston Cistulli, Katie
Degentesh, Alan Gilbert, Cole Heinowitz, Jennifer L. Knox, and Max Winter,
and an improvised set by the Flash Orchestra, led by Drew Gardner. [10:30
pm]


WRITING WORKSHOPS

=20
SURREALISM AND THE RADICAL IMAGINATION =AD=AD JANET HAMILL
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin October 12th
=B3Surrealism and the Radical Imagination=B2 will examine the complex nature of
imagination and its elements - illusionism, unreality, appearance, magic,
phantasm, fancy etc. - and the capacity of imagination to mediate between
the world of objective phenomena and subjective experience. The workshop
will look into the preoccupation of the Romanticists with imagination and
the sublime, the importance of the image to the Symbolists, and the
revolution brought about by the Surrealists to liberate poetic imagination
and take it to the realm of the marvelous.  Through means of Surrealist
games and methods, participants will be encouraged to cultivate their own
imaginations and enhance their imaginative writing skills.  A desire to
rescue poetry from some of its present unimaginative abuses is the only
requirement.

Janet Hamill has authored 4 books, most recently Lost Ceilings, a collectio=
n
of prose poems.  A second CD of words and music, in collaboration with the
band Moving Star, is slated for release in early 2005.


BRAINLINGO: WRITING THE VOICE OF THE BODY =AD=AD EDWIN TORRES
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin November 30
As artists we create our own communication, how we listen affects how we
speak, how we see our language affects how our voice is heard. Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin. This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by
exercising the languages inside us. This is an active writing workshop
requiring a bottomless well and an open mind.

Edwin Torres=B9 books include The All-Union Day Of The Shock Worker, Fracture=
d
Humorous, I Hear Things People Haven=B9t Really Said, and his CDs
Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars) and Novo (www.oozebap.org). He is co-editor of
Rattapallax and has a show on PS.1=B9s internet-radio station (www.wps1.org)
called LIVE NUDE RADIO THEATER.


WRITING IN THE STEPMOTHER TONGUE =AD=AD OZ SHELACH
Thursdays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 14th
Many of us today write in English without being at home. A disability? An
advantage? How and when to adapt, defy, write with an accent, subvert, merg=
e
in, stand out? We'll play games devised by and for non-native writers in
English; Read worldwide fiction; Use supportive criticism. I hope all of us
will come out with deeper confidence in making our writing effective by
drawing on the richness of our difference.

Oz Shelach moved to NY after working as a journalist in Israel (and writing
in Hebrew) for many years. His novel, Picnic Grounds, was published by City
Lights in 2003.

=20
HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD=AD LARRY FAGIN
Fridays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 15th
A workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose (any genre),
who are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or
those who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We
will read (Baudelaire, Stein, Ponge, Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Killarney Clary,
et al), exchange ideas (story, description, image, abstraction, the
personal), and refine our writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly
reading and writing assignments.

Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry (books) and Sal Mimeo (magazine). He
teaches "experimental poetry" at New School University. Coma Rock, a prose
poem, will appear as a chapbook in Winter 2004.


ROCKS AND IDEAS =AD=AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
Saturdays at 12pm: 10 sessions begin October 16th
William Carlos Williams famously said, "--Say it, no ideas but in things--,=
=B2
a line which can be variously interpreted. In our virtual era, ideas and
things may a) be difficult to distinguish and b) have a tendency to morph
into each other.  Williams himself writes an introduction to his long poem
=B3Paterson,=B2 that explains the idea behind the long work. In this workshop w=
e
will experiment with things while having big fat ideas. We'll look at other
important modern and post modern works like Anne Waldman's Iovis, Harryette
Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T and Will Alexander's Asia and Haiti (and others) to
help us along.=20

Rachel Levitsky=B9s books include Under the Sun (Futurepoem, 2003) and the
chapbooks Cartographies of Error (Leroy, 1999) and Dearly, (a+bend, 1999).
She is the founder and co-curator of the Belladonna* Series in New York
City.

Project membership and tuition for any and all fall and spring classes.

For the benefit of the list - as well as Aldon Nielson's research - the
Ornette concert's "poet" - Vincent Harding - has been uncovered. The Nation
review of the concert interesting, as well Harding is probably familiar to
Aldon and others as a thinker on black issues and author of many books,
particularly on figures such as Martin Luther King (according to my Google)=
.

Thanks to Matt Campbell for the info - a major local figure and concert
organizer in the local jazz scene.

Steve:

I was on a 2-year sojourn in Cincinnati when that concert took place, but I
discovered from the extensive "Jazz Festival Archives" (i.e., a banker's bo=
x
of disorganized crapola in my office) that the poet was one Vincent Harding=
.
I found the reference in Gene Santoro's post-festival review in The Nation.

The Harmolodic site confirms it:

"Yet despite having been finally embraced by the establishment, Coleman
never lost his old knack for attracting confrontation and controversy. The
nights of audiences walking out of his shows in the 50s and 60s had a
revival in San Francisco's 1994 Tone Dialing show. In typical eclectic
fashion, the evening offered elaborate entertainment: dancers and a
fifty-foot video screen showing local art. Philosopher Vincent Harding
spontaneously delivered a poem celebrating the night. But the flashpoint
came when the noted body piercing artist, Fakir and his team pierced their
faces and torsos with metal rods, transforming themselves into living
sculpture. The body art ensemble then began a hypnotic dance to Badal Roy's
tabla. With some wonder, Denardo Coleman recalls, 'Half the audience fled,
the other half cheered. But really, the idea was that this was their own
harmolodics, Ornette recognized that these artists took themselves to a
level of consciousness where they could do this with their bodies and he
wanted to support it.'"

[see www.harmolodic.com/ornette/then_text.html, 5th-to-the-last paragraph]

The "spontaneously delivered" lingo makes me think that perhaps Mr. Harding
was just riffin', and that the poem might not have a name.  "Tone Dialing"
is probably a fitting title, tho'...

Hope this helps.

I never would have guessed Vincent Harding, but then I've never actually heard
his speaking voice -- He is a treasure -- co-founder of, among so many other
things, the Institute of the Black World in Atlanta in the 70s -- he was in
Denver last I heard -- Thanks so much for the detective work --

Artists Talk: 1969-1977
Edited by Peggy Gale

An insightful essay by Peggy Gale introduces these transcriptions of
historic talks by internationally known artists, recorded some 30 years ago
at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Included are talks by Vito
Acconci (1977), Carl Andre (1969), Joseph Beuys (1976), Daniel Buren (1973)=
,
James Lee Byars (1970), Paterson Ewen (1976), Robert Filliou (1973), Dan
Graham (1973 and 1977), Douglas Huebler (1973), Joseph Kosuth (1969), Sol
LeWitt (1970), Mel Ramsden for Art & Language (1972), Alan Sondheim (1973),
and Lawrence Weiner 1972). These transcriptions are all available for the
first time. An important resource for contemporary art and its attendant
issues, Artists Talk reveals artists=B9 concerns during a period bracketed =
by
conceptual art and an international restructuring of power and influence in
the art world.

- I want to add here that the book has meant an enormous amount to me -
not only for the artists' words, but also for the content, which is still
literally open to question and idea - two of the concepts, along with
world and art, that are discussed here. My own piece in such company has
made me rethink, not only my own work, but art's relation to the net, in
terms of issues of ontology and epistemology.

- The book also represents an absolutely incredible program run by the
relatively geographically-isolated Nova Scotia College of Art and Design -
a program in which the students were treated as adults, as functioning
artists - and they rose to the occasion.

Hi All,

  Today is a sad day in the Micro-broadcasting world. This morning
(September 29th) at 9:20 am U.S. Marshals and the FCC shut down Free
Radio Santa Cruz. As posted on their website all equipment was
confiscated.
http://www.freakradio.org/

Pirate Cat Radio has offered to donate a 10 watt transmitter to get
F.R.S.C. back on the air, but no word yet.

Free Radio Santa Cruz was not the only station to be shut down this
month; KFAR in Knoxville,TN was also shut down on the 15th of
September.
http://www.kfar.org/pr-fcc-01.html

Situations of this type are a bit scary, especially since the Santa
Cruz raid is so close to home. The FCC is using stations like FRSC and
KFAR as examples to try and scare other Pirate Stations off the air.
The last thing the Federal government wants during the political
climate of this election is opposition to "spoon feed media" such as
FOX and NBC. Now that the November elections are coming up it is
highly important for each and every one of you to strive to find
alternative sources to the main stream media and to share that
information with others by any means necessary.

With that:

            This weekend kicks off the Pirate Cat Radio "Anti-Bush
Film Fest".  Every Sunday at 5pm in October, Pirate Cat Radio 87.9fm
presents a different film denouncing the Bush Monarchy.

-October 3rd at 5pm Fahrenheit 9/11
-October 10th at 5pm Outfoxed "Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism
-October 17th at 5pm Noam Chomsky's Distorted Morality:"America's War
on Terror?"
-October 24th at 5pm Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War
-October 31st at 5pm Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election

All movies are FREE to the public and will be held at:
The Dark Room
2263 Mission St.
San Francisco, CA 94110

Thanks, Pierre.  I've been following at a distance the increasing repression
and libelling of Arabic intellectuals in US universities.  It's hard not to
think of 1930s Germany.

  Professor Who Said CBS Memos on Bush Might Not Be Fakes Is Pilloried by
Critics Who Want Him Fired
By DAVID GLENN















 Easy-to-print version
 from today's CHRONICLE OF HIGHER ED

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Professor who said CBS memos on Bush might not be fakes is pilloried by critics
who want him fired







Just when the nation seemed to have wearied of debates about kerning and
proportional fonts, the controversy surrounding apparently forged documents
about President Bush's National Guard service has flared anew -- this time, on
a university campus. Conservative activists have begun an informal campaign to
pressure Utah State University to censure or fire a scholar who has argued that
the documents might be genuine.

Three weeks ago, the scholar -- David E. Hailey Jr., an associate professor of
English at Utah State -- posted a report about the documents on the Web site of
the university's Interactive Media Research Laboratory, of which he is the
director. In the report, Mr. Hailey argued that the disputed documents, which
were originally described by Dan Rather on a CBS News broadcast on September 8,
were almost certainly created by a typewriter or other mechanical device, and
not by a modern-day word processor. The documents might indeed be forgeries, he
wrote, but if so, they were not crude, obvious forgeries, as many of CBS's
critics have charged.

Mr. Hailey has no direct experience in forensic textual analysis, but he has
taught courses in textual design and digital archiving for many years. "I've
been up to my eyeballs in text since 1966," he said in an interview on Monday.

A number of online critics, not all of whom say Mr. Hailey should be formally
punished, have argued during the past several days that his report is sloppy
and deceptive. Some critics have even campaigned against Mr. Hailey, sometimes
in vitriolic terms. Kermit Hall, president of Utah State, estimated in an
interview on Monday that he had received 25 e-mail messages condemning Mr.
Hailey.

Mr. Hailey has denied a partisan motive. "The purpose of this report has never
been to demonstrate that these memos are authentic," he said on Monday. "The
purpose has always been simply to figure out what typeface was used. And then I
also felt kind of bad about Dan Rather's situation ... Given the physical
nature of these documents, there's no reason that [CBS officials] should have
known that they were not authentic."

But some observers view Mr. Hailey's report with deep skepticism. "He seems to
go from unwarranted assumptions to foregone conclusions," Joseph M. Newcomer, a
Pittsburgh software developer, said in an interview on Monday. "There are huge
gaps in the reasoning and the presentation, and he has not made his case."

Mr. Newcomer, who emphasizes on his Web site that he is no fan of President Bush
and has no political ax to grind, gained prominence last month as a critic of
the CBS memos. A former research computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon
University, he said on Monday that he would soon post a detailed critique of
Mr. Hailey's report on his Web site.

Certain people who have seen such criticisms online are demanding Mr. Hailey's
scalp. One of the more civil messages, which was left on Friday by an anonymous
visitor to the Weblog known as Little Green Footballs, reads: "As a citizen of
Utah, I've sent an email to the Speaker of the Utah State House, the governor,
and the president of USU. This will not stand."

And on a blog titled Rathergate, another anonymous visitor commented: "I say
give me back my Gold Shield from my Federal Agent days and let me go to Utah!"

Mr. Hall said that the university strongly supports its beleaguered scholar.
"Most of what I received took the form of an effort to smear him and then
subsequently to smear the university by saying that the administration asked
him to conduct this project, which is wrong, false, incorrect," he said. "But I
absolutely defend his right both to pursue the issues that were before him, and
also to choose the form of publication that he did."

Mr. Hailey said he had been hit with a mountain of angry e-mail. Beginning last
Wednesday, he said, "I received hate mail for three days in extreme amounts. It
was just all one big roar. ... They're calling me a fraud, writing the
president of the university and my department head, and insisting that I be
fired. ... If a guy throws a rock at you, it's a bruise. But if a thousand
people throw a rock at you, it's an execution."

Mr. Hailey was not among the typographic experts consulted by CBS before it
broadcast its report on the purported Bush documents. But if he had been
approached by CBS producers, he wrote in his report, he "would have advised
them that there is nothing physical in the memos implying that they are not
authentic." (CBS has apparently now taken note of Mr. Hailey's work. A Dallas
newspaper reported last week that Mary Mapes, who produced the disputed
broadcast, has been circulating Mr. Hailey's report to colleagues.)

The report makes two major arguments. First, it says, the font used in the CBS
memos was almost certainly not -- as many skeptics have alleged -- Times New
Roman, a modern digital font that did not exist in the early 1970s, when the
memos were purportedly created. Mr. Hailey says that the text is more
consistent with a family of fonts known as Typewriter, some of which were used
in typewriters 30 years ago.

And second, Mr. Hailey argues, certain frequently used letters in the CBS memos
-- such as "e" and "t" -- show regular patterns of wear. Such patterns of wear
would be consistent with a typewriter but not with a word processor.
"Characters that are seldom used show no sign of damage," Mr. Hailey said.
"Characters that are continuously used show signs of wear."

Mr. Hailey's critics have attacked both his arguments and his methods. Mr.
Newcomer said the patterns of wear are dissimilar, not consistent. has accused
Mr. Hailey of manipulating the text, by digitally cutting and pasting the
letters from various online font directories, in order to prove predetermined
conclusions.

Mr. Hailey said on Monday that such criticism reflected a fundamental
misunderstanding of his method. It was necessary to cut and paste every letter
in his sample document, he said, because he had digitally created a
Typewriter-font alphabet that incorporated the defects in the memos' letters.

As for the campaign to have Mr. Hailey censured or fired, one of his online
critics expressed regret on Monday at the rhetoric used by some of his Web
site's readers. "We can't really control where people are going and what
they're doing," said Kevin Aylward, a Virginia technology consultant who is the
primary author of wizbangblog.com. "We get thousands of comments a day. If I
see a phone number or something, that immediately is deleted. But I generally
don't read them that closely."

"I don't think he should lose his job," Mr. Aylward continued. "I don't know
that he should be punished. Certainly if I were the department head, I would
say, 'Hey -- get this in order.' Our only interest was that this not become a
defense exhibit for Dan Rather and Mary Mapes."

Mr. Hailey said that university administrators have been "totally supportive."

"They see this as an issue of academic freedom and freedom of speech," he said.
"They looked at my stuff. It was not political. It was an area where I'm, if
not an expert, at least able to come up with an informed opinion."

Greetings,

Some folks I hang out with were talking about the paradelle form,
which I'd heard mentioned before but just never got around to learning
up on or attempting to write (so many forms, so little coffee).  So I
did some research, and found at:

http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Paradelle

this lovely notion that it was all a hoax form of Billy Collins'
doing, invented to parody strict forms, and that it has now taken on a
life of its own as knuckleheads like me proceed to attempt it, even
with full knowledge of its hoaxness.

So I thought I would share the hoax, the continuing life, and my own
attempt at it, in one of the few arenas I know of which might be
capable of welcoming all three.  It's more for performance than the
page--I'll trust you to imagine inflections.

Below, an excellent post presented to=20

much beyond that.

Thought it good enough to share with others,
including Poetics List folks, regardless it is=20
not primarily a Poetics topic.

I would add to it that "something or some things=20
in the collective American psyche permitted=20
Bush/Cheney to find a mirror," as it were.
 =20
I, for one, would welcome any good recommendations
for directing writing efforts at this horror and
ulcer that has especially erupted and spread=20
these last 4 years.  Yeah, "writing," especially
"poetry," is not supposed to mix so well with=20
political/social activism/agency, whatever, but Gee=20
Whiz, these last four years have sure changed
me, and I'm sure many others.  Frankly, I'd
gladly give up the chance for certain Poetry=20
"recognition" some day for certain resolution
to these horrible issues that leave people
maimed and suffering.

Blah blah.  Sorry if I'm speaking from a dicho-
tomized perspective that merely shows "I don't=20
know better." I do know this, though:  I sure
want to learn!

I'm going to venture that it isn't necessarily "George Bush, keeping =
America scared."    America has been perfectly willing to play along, =
because it is a mentality that spreads far beyond the reach of one man.  =
 One man is only as powerful as the emotion he taps into, and that =
emotion must necessarily be present in the society (or present in =
humanity?) already to have such a profound effect.  The video itself =
showed many more people than just our chimpy little friend, and there =
are many more people in the country entirely willing to believe that the =
Middle East is the Axis of Evil (or wherever the  Foreign Villain
of the Moment is), and have been believing it since years before George =
was boozing his way through college.  Having a President and government =
willing to state prejudices out loud just gives people permission to =
feed their fear.
=20
I think the elections are just the beginning of the work needed to be =
done.

I have wrote some Paradelles ("A Pair of Pirandello Paradelles") which
have the added distinction of having been rejected by Billy Collins
himself from the Paradelle Anthology.

Hoax or not, this looks like fun--and whoever said we can't have fun with

the uselessness of poems


why would one write a poem . in a poem statements are
not to be taken at face value . everything is excused
. metaphors are always broken . the tropes are torpor
describe millennia ago . abstraction and codework or
oulipo tricks are those of dying form . to bear
witness implies the necessity of clear speech . the
language is already debased . nothing will bring it
back and we all know about the problematic of origins
. nothing stops the devolution of an increasingly
minor art . there is no reason whatsoever to
teach poetry in the school system . today the
average nursery-rhyme, already antiquated, says
more about culture and cultural context than any
contemporary poet . poetics is the last refuge of
the damned, always involved in recuperation . the
code-forms of traditional poetry are permanently
lost in the virtual digital and dawning world .
statements in poems are always already hyperbole
. to speak to each other is to speak to no one .
the poetry slam at least has the virtue of
contestation . poems are fearful of the world .
the contemporary world is all we have . the last
place one looks for testimony is the poem . the
poetry of previous centuries envelops us like
good late-night television . the condensation of
kennings and waka is destroyed by the infinity of
digital type . poet on one hand, rockhop on the
other as we go out singing . don't mistake
content . cleverness is the last refuge of the
poet . happy poems make good times of us all .
what at this point is the point of searching for
the word . i begin to write a poem: i sit at a
tablet in a certain position . language swirls in
the absence of content . the world demands
nothing of the poet . writers, no readers . with
charm the poet fools the poet . the crashed world
. we are our own victims of surplus . we are our
own surplus victims .

Here's another, Catherine:

Go in Fear of Abstraction! Written Entirely in The New
Sentence
--for Dimes, Drawers, Azaleas

I.
The call of poetry: the nick pale, a dime. The call of
poetry: the nick pale, a dime. This rose, that fell,
the flower of fortune. This rose, that fell, the
flower of fortune. A poetry nick, this, that, the fell
flower, the dime of fortune, the pale call of rose.

II.
My pal, poetry, calls me frenetically. My pal, poetry,
calls me frenetically, “There’s a sale going on—no,
no, no, a riot.” “There’s a sale going on—no, no, no,
a riot.” No sale, pal—no poetry, no riot.  My calls.
There’s a me frenetically going on.

III.
She looked like a mandrill, that poem, painted,
ferocious. She looked like a mandrill, that poem,
painted, ferocious. Tidy as sock drawers, fragrant as
azalea, we fed. Tidy as sock drawers, fragrant as
azalea, we fed. Painted as tidy as we looked,
azalea-like, that ferocious she-poem fed drawers a
fragrant mandrill sock.

IV.
Poetry:  Painted sock, tidy as like, as a. That she
looked pale, this me fragrant.
A no, the on, that flower we frenetically fed. The
rose fell going no! no!  My pal, there’s a mandrill, a
poem going riot! Call the sale, calls of nick fortune.
 Poetry of dime, drawers, azalea.

Why am I excited? Because I recorded two albums with them back in the 60s,
and they're available again.
Not to mention the absolutely incredible music of Ornette Coleman, Albert
Ayler, and others.
Compared to them I'm a rank (in both senses of the word I suppose)

*Paradelle: Billy Collins invented this form allegedly to parody
strict forms, particularly the villanelle. Collins's description of
the form was a footnote to the first paradelle: "The paradelle is one
of the more demanding French fixed forms, first appearing in the
langue d'oc love poetry of the eleventh century. It is a poem of four
six-line stanzas in which the first and second lines, as well as the
third and fourth lines of the first three stanzas, must be identical.
The fifth and sixth lines, which traditionally resolve these stanzas,
must use all the words from the preceding lines and only those words.
Similiarly, the final stanza must use every word from all the
preceding stanzas and only these words."

*Paradelle: Billy Collins invented this form allegedly to parody
strict forms, particularly the villanelle. Collins's description of
the form was a footnote to the first paradelle: "The paradelle is one
of the more demanding French fixed forms, first appearing in the
langue d'oc love poetry of the eleventh century. It is a poem of four
six-line stanzas in which the first and second lines, as well as the
third and fourth lines of the first three stanzas, must be identical.
The fifth and sixth lines, which traditionally resolve these stanzas,
must use all the words from the preceding lines and only those words.
Similiarly, the final stanza must use every word from all the
preceding stanzas and only these words."

I've posted some poems about BROCKTON, MASSACHUSETTS, on my site, at:

I realize that it's not real publishing unless someone publishes it for

so, now we know what POETRY is doing with it's 100 mill -- and I can say
that I laughed when I read that they gave Billy Collins a humor award --

but the Neglected award to Sam Menasche is in fact interesting -- got to
talk with him quite a bit at Orono during the 50s conference -- he had
great jean Garrigue stories, I seem to recall -- first place I'd ever heard
him read, and haven't heard him since --

I guess it's never too late to learn about new forms, even hoax forms.
But this one may solve a problem for me: How to get a certain political

Steve,

What is the video that the DFAer refers to?

Sounds like she has been too long in the trenches, but I do wonder many of
my fellow citizens have forgotten that "We have nothing to fear but fear
itself."

America has been perfectly willing to play along, because it is a mentality that spreads far beyond the reach of one man.   One man is only as powerful as the emotion he taps into, and that emotion must necessarily be present in the society (or present in humanity?) already to have such a profound effect.  The video itself showed many more people than just our chimpy little friend, and there are many more people in the country entirely willing to believe that the Middle East is the Axis of Evil (or wherever the  Foreign Villain

 >>INFO: friends of amiri baraka
=========================

Greetings,

I hope all is well.  The Virginia conference was transforming.  Getting
to meet those who have inspired me such as Nikki Giovanni, Sonia
Sanchez, Amiri & Amina Baraka (again), and Haki Madhubuti was truly
energizing.  They all stressed the importance of being a true student of
poetry and reading more, which many performance poets of my generation
and younger do not do.

I had the pleasure of driving the Barakas to DC for a private reading
and Amiri Baraka asked me to be their "Special Invited Guest".  It truly
capped off an inspiring week of poetry and just building community.  I
was truly honored.  I have now joined the "Friends of Amiri & Amina
Baraka" movement.  The goal is to bring the Barakas to private homes
worldwide for private readings.  If you are interested, please e-mail
Tom Peterman, scrazzel@aol.com <mailto:scrazzel@aol.com>.  You can tell
him you received his address from me.

This week was also great because I was able to go back into the schools
and do work.  I worked with about 400 8th graders in Westland Middle
School in Bethesda, MD and about 40-50 high school students At Brookline
High School in MA.  Working with the youth is one of the favorite parts
of this work.

Don't forget the Black Luv Fest next weekend!  This will be my last
event in the States before heading to South Africa.  The TransAfrica
Forum conference has been changed to January, 2005.  I will share some
book reviews/blurbs with you next week.  I wanted to do it today but I'm
out of town and they're at home!  Take care!

Saadet T=FCrk=F6z Bio       (For excellent video clips:
http://www=2Esaadet=2Ech/index-flash=2Ehtml )
Saadet T=FCrk=F6z was born in Istanbul in 1961=2E Due to the political pre=
ssures
of the Chinese government upon the Turk people in East Turkestan (Uyghur
Autonomous Region), her parents fled to Istanbul, where they settled as
Kazakh refugees=2E  They transmitted to Ms Turkoez the rich oral and music=
al
traditions of Central Asia=2E As a child, living in Istanbul, Saadet was
fascinated by the Arabic language and the melodious texts of the Koran
=93which gave me the first opportunity to deliberately improvise without
paying attention to sense and correctness=2E=94

At 20 years old, she left Istanbul for Switzerland, where she experienced
an exciting new world of music: free jazz, improvisation and a refreshing
openness towards experimentation which paralleled her unbiased approach to=

the musical traditions of her origins=2E

In her performances of Kazakh and Turkish songs, Ms=2E Turkoez is looking =
to
transform memory=2E She seeks to evoke pictures and atmosphere by means of=

voice and music which transcends cultural boundaries=2E  Memory is everywh=
ere
and every time the same - not changeable - but the expression is different=
:
Individual perception develops a universal impression of the cultural life=
=2E=20

In addition to frequent solo concerts,  Ms=2E Turkoez regularly perform in=

duos, trios or bigger formations with free improvising jazz musicians -=20=

such as Elliot Sharp, Werner Luedi,  Eyvind Kang, Voice Crack, Peter
Kowald, Gianni Gebbia, Michael Zerang, Ikue Mori, Mark Dresser, Miya
Masaoka, Fred Frith, Xu Feng Shia, Carl Stone, Fritz Hauser, Peggy Lee,

What We Live      History and individual Bios:=20

What We Live is a San Francisco based  jazz/ improvised music group formed=

by bassist/composer Lisle Ellis in1994=2E The three regular members are Li=
sle
ELLIS: acoustic bass; Lawrence OCHS, tenor and sopranino saxophones; Don
ROBINSON, drums and percussion=2E  The ensemble's formation was inspired b=
y
and a direct result of Ellis' work with Ochs and Robinson within the
context of The Glenn Spearman Double Trio, which performed and recorded
from 1991 until the leader's death in 1998=2E  Ellis' initial vision was t=
o
bring together a small group of musicians to investigate concepts central
to the tradition of jazz-based improvisation - swing, song form,
modalities, etc - in a less explicit manner than the  mainstream  but in a=

more emphatically traditional way than offered by the practice of free jaz=
z
=2E Over a period of time the concept of the trio evolved more towards a
collective situation rather than being solely the vision of an individual
musician=2E A group voice or sound has emerged that is immediately
recognizable=2E  Compositions by Ellis and Ochs as well as group compositi=
ons
make up the music=2E

The musicians of What We Live are veterans in the fields of improvised and=

new music=2E Originally from Canada, Lisle Ellis  was the first recipient =

musician who demonstrated innovation and integrity in their field=2E  He h=
as
performed with the Cecil Taylor Unit and with Paul Bley among many, many
others=2E Under his own name, a 1993 release entitled Elevations

WRITING WORKSHOPS

 SURREALISM AND THE RADICAL IMAGINATION =AD=AD JANET HAMILL
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin October 12th
=B3Surrealism and the Radical Imagination=B2 will examine the complex nature of
imagination and its elements - illusionism, unreality, appearance, magic,
phantasm, fancy etc. - and the capacity of imagination to mediate between
the world of objective phenomena and subjective experience. The workshop
will look into the preoccupation of the Romanticists with imagination and
the sublime, the importance of the image to the Symbolists, and the
revolution brought about by the Surrealists to liberate poetic imagination
and take it to the realm of the marvelous.  Through means of Surrealist
games and methods, participants will be encouraged to cultivate their own
imaginations and enhance their imaginative writing skills.  A desire to
rescue poetry from some of its present unimaginative abuses is the only
requirement.

Janet Hamill has authored 4 books, most recently Lost Ceilings, a collectio=
n
of prose poems.  A second CD of words and music, in collaboration with the
band Moving Star, is slated for release in early 2005.

BRAINLINGO: WRITING THE VOICE OF THE BODY =AD=AD EDWIN TORRES
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin November 30
As artists we create our own communication, how we listen affects how we
speak, how we see our language affects how our voice is heard. Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin. This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by
exercising the languages inside us. This is an active writing workshop
requiring a bottomless well and an open mind.

Edwin Torres=B9 books include The All-Union Day Of The Shock Worker, Fracture=
d
Humorous, I Hear Things People Haven=B9t Really Said, and his CDs
Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars) and Novo (www.oozebap.org). He is co-editor of
Rattapallax and has a show on PS.1=B9s internet-radio station (www.wps1.org)
called LIVE NUDE RADIO THEATER.

WRITING IN THE STEPMOTHER TONGUE =AD=AD OZ SHELACH

Many of us today write in English without being at home. A disability? An
advantage? How and when to adapt, defy, write with an accent, subvert, merg=
e
in, stand out? We'll play games devised by and for non-native writers in
English; Read worldwide fiction; Use supportive criticism. I hope all of us
will come out with deeper confidence in making our writing effective by
drawing on the richness of our difference.

HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD=AD LARRY FAGIN
Fridays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 15th
A workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose (any genre),
who are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or
those who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We
will read (Baudelaire, Stein, Ponge, Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Killarney Clary,
et al), exchange ideas (story, description, image, abstraction, the
personal), and refine our writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly
reading and writing assignments.

Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry (books) and Sal Mimeo (magazine). He
teaches "experimental poetry" at New School University. Coma Rock, a prose
poem, will appear as a chapbook in Winter 2004.

ROCKS AND IDEAS =AD=AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
Saturdays at 12pm: 10 sessions begin October 16th
William Carlos Williams famously said, "--Say it, no ideas but in things--,=
=B2
a line which can be variously interpreted. In our virtual era, ideas and
things may a) be difficult to distinguish and b) have a tendency to morph
into each other.  Williams himself writes an introduction to his long poem
=B3Paterson,=B2 that explains the idea behind the long work. In this workshop w=
e
will experiment with things while having big fat ideas. We'll look at other
important modern and post modern works like Anne Waldman's Iovis, Harryette
Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T and Will Alexander's Asia and Haiti (and others) to
help us along.=20

Rachel Levitsky=B9s books include Under the Sun (Futurepoem, 2003) and the
chapbooks Cartographies of Error (Leroy, 1999) and Dearly, (a+bend, 1999).
She is the founder and co-curator of the Belladonna* Series in New York
City.

The workshop fee is $300, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall and spring classes.

Fiery Austrian Writer Wins Nobel Prize for Literature
By TERENCE NEILAN


PARIS, Oct. 7 =97 Elfriede Jelinek, a reclusive Austrian novelist and=20
playwright who is well known in the German-speaking world for works=20
that denounce sexual violence as well as oppression and right-wing=20
extremism in Austria, was awarded the 2004 Nobel prize for literature=20
today by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.

There had been speculation that this year's prize might go to a woman,=20=

but Ms. Jelinek had not been mentioned among possible contenders. She=20
is the first woman to win the award since Toni Morrison in 1996 and=20
only the 10th since the prize was created in 1901.

In other ways, Ms. Jelinek fits a more familiar pattern. She is the=20
seventh European literature laureate in the past decade. The academy=20
has also again shown a preference for literature with a political echo.=20=

As with several recent winners, including last year's, J. M. Coetzee, a=20=

critic of South Africa's apartheid regime, Ms. Jelinek has used her=20
literary work as a form of political engagement.

In its citation, the 18-member Swedish Academy said Ms. Jelinek, 57,=20
had been chosen "for her musical flow of voices and counter-voices in=20
novels and plays that with extraordinary linguistic zeal reveal the=20
absurdity of society's clich=E9s and their subjugating power." This=20
year's literature prize is worth the equivalent of $1.35 million.

In an interview with Swedish Radio from her home in Vienna, Ms. Jelinek=20=

said the prize was "surprising and a great honor," but she said she was=20=

too ill to travel to Stockholm for the awards ceremony in December.=20
Later, she told Reuters: "I am not mentally able to withstand that. I=20
have a social phobia and cannot stand these large crowds of people. But=20=

I will certainly write a speech."

  Still, for all her flight from the limelight, Ms. Jelinek is very much=20=

a public figure in Austria and Germany. Her writing, which includes=20
poetry, an opera libretto and screenplays, has turned her into=20
something of a cult figure with its deep pessimism about the human=20
condition. At the same time, she is a fierce opponent of Austria's=20
far-right Freedom Party, and banned performances of her plays after the=20=

party entered the government in 2000.

Outside the German-speaking world, she is less known, although some of=20=

her works have been translated into English, French and Swedish. Four=20
of her best known novels =97 "The Piano Teacher," "Wonderful, Wonderful=20=

Times," "Lust" and "Women as Lovers" =97 have been published in English=20=

by the London-based publisher Serpent's Tail.

"She's very controversial and has a very feminist voice," Peter Ayrton,=20=

Serpent's Tail's publisher, said in a telephone interview from the=20
Frankfurt Book Fair. "She's also very innovative both at the level of=20
content but also formally. She's very adventurous. She's a playwright=20
and poet too and is always doing crazy and wonderful things with the=20
form of the novel."

"The Piano Teacher," one of her darker novels, was turned into a=20
French-language movie by the Austrian director Michael Haneke ("Funny=20
Games"), with Isabelle Huppert in the role of Erika Kohut, a music=20
teacher who seeks escape from her oppressive mother through sexual=20
kinkiness. The movie, no less than the novel, shocked some people with=20=

its sexual violence.

Reviewing the novel in The New York Times in 1988, Michiko Kakutani=20
wrote of Ms. Jelinek's "uncompromising vision," but noted: "Too often,=20=

however, her descriptions of Erika's violent fantasies seem willfully=20
perverse =97 as though they'd been concocted for the sole purpose of=20
shocking the reader =97 and her relentless focus on the dark underside =
of=20
Viennese life can seem equally artificial and contrived. In the end, it=20=

makes for a novel that depresses rather than genuinely disturbs."

Ms. Jelinek, who was born Oct. 20, 1946, in the Austrian town of=20
M=FCrzzuschlag to a father of Czech-Jewish origin and an Austrian =
mother,=20
studied composition in the Vienna Conservatory while attending theater=20=

and art history classes at the University of Vienna. She published her=20=

first collection of poems in 1967 and soon afterwards began writing=20
fiction. In 1974, she joined the Austrian Communist Party and remained=20=

a member until 1991.

She made her name as a novelist in 1975 with "Women as Lovers," in=20
which two female friends travel to an Alpine resort in search of the=20
perfect man, with unexpected results. "Wonderful, Wonderful Times"=20
followed in 1980 and "The Piano Teacher" in 1983. The Swedish Academy=20
said these novels "present a pitiless world where the reader is=20
confronted with a locked-down regime of violence and submission, hunter=20=

and prey."

Of "Lust," published in German in 1989, the academy said Ms. Jelinek=20
"lets her social analysis swell to fundamental criticism of=20
civilization by describing sexual violence against women as the actual=20=

template of our culture." In other books and plays, though, she focused=20=

her criticism on Austria and its refusal to confront its Nazi past. In=20=

her 1975 novel "The Children of the Dead," she depicts her native land=20=

as, in the words of the academy, "a realm of death."

Today, Ms. Jelinek divides her time between Vienna, where her mother=20
lives, and Munich, the home town of her husband, Gottfried H=FCngsberg.=20=

But while she is acclaimed in Germany, where she won the Heinrich B=F6ll=20=

Prize in 1986 and the Heinrich Heine Prize in 2002, her relationship=20
with Austria remains complicated. Even today, as Austria's president,=20
Heinz Fischer, was praising her Nobel prize as a "tribute to all=20
Austrian literature," she told Swedish Radio that she did not see it as=20=

"a feather in Austria's cap."

Her most vocal critics are on Austria's far right. In 1998, Jorg=20
Haider's Freedom Party distributed posters reading: "Do You Want=20
Jelinek, Turrini and Peymann, or Do You Want Art?" (Peter Turrini, a=20
writer, and Claus Peymann, a theater director, had also angered=20
Austrian nationalists.) Then, after Mr. Haider entered the Austrian=20
government in 2000, Ms. Jelinka prohibited performances of her plays in=20=

Austria. "My words will have an effect in that they won't be heard any=20=

more," she said in a statement.

But she did not remain silent. The following year, she wrote a play,=20
"The Farewell," that attacked the extreme right and was produced by the=20=

Berliner Ensemble in Berlin. The production's director, Ulrike=20
Ottinger, turned Ms. Jelinek's monologue into a Greek-style chorus in=20
which the text was spoken by 13 actors dressed in Mr. Haider's=20
typically flamboyant clothes. "More of a happening than theater," a=20
critic for The Berliner Zeitung noted.

Certainly, Ms. Jelinka's plays are anything but conventional. The=20
Swedish Academy noted that, as the focus of her writing has moved from=20=

novels to drama, she has abandoned "traditional dialogue for a kind of=20=

polyphonic monologues that do not serve to delineate roles but to=20
permit voices from various levels of the psyche and history to be heard=20=

simultaneously."

Underlining her interest in experimenting in all literary forms, last=20
year Ms. Jelinka wrote the libretto for an opera composed by Olga=20
Neuwirth, also an Austrian, which was based on David Lynch's enigmatic=20=

movie "Lost Highway." "It's pretty much impossible to translate an=20
artwork like this into another genre," Ms. Jelinek said in an interview=20=

at the time with The New York Times. "But musical theater is possible=20
because, like film, it is another way of playing with time flow."

While the form taken by her writing constantly shifts, however, its=20
fundamental purpose appears to be to disturb. As Agence France-Presse=20
quoted her as saying in a recent interview: "My writings are limited to=20=

depicting analytically, but also polemically, the horrors of reality.=20
Redemption is the speciality of other authors, male and female."

It strikes me with the Nobel and Poetry Magazine Awards being
announced in tandem today  that once
again Europe has honored intellectual tradition,  pessimism,
serious
ideas,  while our home-grown awards go to pithy, "lite"
versifiers.  Maybe
the  political climate (I just read an article stating that Bush
will probably
win because Americans want an optimistic president!!- torture and
invasions aside--) presides over
"official" poetry here too.

October 7, 2004

Fiery Austrian Writer Wins Nobel Prize for Literature
By TERENCE NEILAN


PARIS, Oct. 7 =97 Elfriede Jelinek, a reclusive Austrian novelist and=20
playwright who is well known in the German-speaking world for works=20
that denounce sexual violence as well as oppression and right-wing=20
extremism in Austria, was awarded the 2004 Nobel prize for literature=20
today by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.

There had been speculation that this year's prize might go to a woman,=20
but Ms. Jelinek had not been mentioned among possible contenders. She=20
is the first woman to win the award since Toni Morrison in 1996 and=20
only the 10th since the prize was created in 1901.

In other ways, Ms. Jelinek fits a more familiar pattern. She is the=20
seventh European literature laureate in the past decade. The academy=20
has also again shown a preference for literature with a political echo.=20
As with several recent winners, including last year's, J. M. Coetzee, a=20
critic of South Africa's apartheid regime, Ms. Jelinek has used her=20
literary work as a form of political engagement.

In its citation, the 18-member Swedish Academy said Ms. Jelinek, 57,=20
had been chosen "for her musical flow of voices and counter-voices in=20
novels and plays that with extraordinary linguistic zeal reveal the=20
absurdity of society's clich=E9s and their subjugating power." This=20
year's literature prize is worth the equivalent of $1.35 million.

In an interview with Swedish Radio from her home in Vienna, Ms. Jelinek=20
said the prize was "surprising and a great honor," but she said she was=20
too ill to travel to Stockholm for the awards ceremony in December.=20
Later, she told Reuters: "I am not mentally able to withstand that. I=20
have a social phobia and cannot stand these large crowds of people. But=20
I will certainly write a speech."

  Still, for all her flight from the limelight, Ms. Jelinek is very much

a public figure in Austria and Germany. Her writing, which includes=20
poetry, an opera libretto and screenplays, has turned her into=20
something of a cult figure with its deep pessimism about the human=20
condition. At the same time, she is a fierce opponent of Austria's=20
far-right Freedom Party, and banned performances of her plays after the=20
party entered the government in 2000.

Outside the German-speaking world, she is less known, although some of=20
her works have been translated into English, French and Swedish. Four=20
of her best known novels =97 "The Piano Teacher," "Wonderful, Wonderful=20
Times," "Lust" and "Women as Lovers" =97 have been published in English=20
by the London-based publisher Serpent's Tail.

"She's very controversial and has a very feminist voice," Peter Ayrton,=20
Serpent's Tail's publisher, said in a telephone interview from the=20
Frankfurt Book Fair. "She's also very innovative both at the level of=20
content but also formally. She's very adventurous. She's a playwright=20
and poet too and is always doing crazy and wonderful things with the=20
form of the novel."

"The Piano Teacher," one of her darker novels, was turned into a=20
French-language movie by the Austrian director Michael Haneke ("Funny=20
Games"), with Isabelle Huppert in the role of Erika Kohut, a music=20
teacher who seeks escape from her oppressive mother through sexual=20
kinkiness. The movie, no less than the novel, shocked some people with=20
its sexual violence.

Reviewing the novel in The New York Times in 1988, Michiko Kakutani=20
wrote of Ms. Jelinek's "uncompromising vision," but noted: "Too often,=20
however, her descriptions of Erika's violent fantasies seem willfully=20
perverse =97 as though they'd been concocted for the sole purpose of=20
shocking the reader =97 and her relentless focus on the dark underside =
of=20
Viennese life can seem equally artificial and contrived. In the end, it=20
makes for a novel that depresses rather than genuinely disturbs."

Ms. Jelinek, who was born Oct. 20, 1946, in the Austrian town of=20
M=FCrzzuschlag to a father of Czech-Jewish origin and an Austrian =
mother,=20
studied composition in the Vienna Conservatory while attending theater=20
and art history classes at the University of Vienna. She published her=20
first collection of poems in 1967 and soon afterwards began writing=20
fiction. In 1974, she joined the Austrian Communist Party and remained=20
a member until 1991.

She made her name as a novelist in 1975 with "Women as Lovers," in=20
which two female friends travel to an Alpine resort in search of the=20
perfect man, with unexpected results. "Wonderful, Wonderful Times"=20
followed in 1980 and "The Piano Teacher" in 1983. The Swedish Academy=20
said these novels "present a pitiless world where the reader is=20
confronted with a locked-down regime of violence and submission, hunter=20
and prey."

Of "Lust," published in German in 1989, the academy said Ms. Jelinek=20
"lets her social analysis swell to fundamental criticism of=20
civilization by describing sexual violence against women as the actual=20
template of our culture." In other books and plays, though, she focused=20
her criticism on Austria and its refusal to confront its Nazi past. In=20
her 1975 novel "The Children of the Dead," she depicts her native land=20
as, in the words of the academy, "a realm of death."

Today, Ms. Jelinek divides her time between Vienna, where her mother=20
lives, and Munich, the home town of her husband, Gottfried H=FCngsberg.=20
But while she is acclaimed in Germany, where she won the Heinrich B=F6ll =

Prize in 1986 and the Heinrich Heine Prize in 2002, her relationship=20
with Austria remains complicated. Even today, as Austria's president,=20
Heinz Fischer, was praising her Nobel prize as a "tribute to all=20
Austrian literature," she told Swedish Radio that she did not see it as=20
"a feather in Austria's cap."

Her most vocal critics are on Austria's far right. In 1998, Jorg=20
Haider's Freedom Party distributed posters reading: "Do You Want=20
Jelinek, Turrini and Peymann, or Do You Want Art?" (Peter Turrini, a=20
writer, and Claus Peymann, a theater director, had also angered=20
Austrian nationalists.) Then, after Mr. Haider entered the Austrian=20
government in 2000, Ms. Jelinka prohibited performances of her plays in=20
Austria. "My words will have an effect in that they won't be heard any=20
more," she said in a statement.

But she did not remain silent. The following year, she wrote a play,=20
"The Farewell," that attacked the extreme right and was produced by the=20
Berliner Ensemble in Berlin. The production's director, Ulrike=20
Ottinger, turned Ms. Jelinek's monologue into a Greek-style chorus in=20
which the text was spoken by 13 actors dressed in Mr. Haider's=20
typically flamboyant clothes. "More of a happening than theater," a=20
critic for The Berliner Zeitung noted.

Certainly, Ms. Jelinka's plays are anything but conventional. The=20
Swedish Academy noted that, as the focus of her writing has moved from=20
novels to drama, she has abandoned "traditional dialogue for a kind of=20
polyphonic monologues that do not serve to delineate roles but to=20
permit voices from various levels of the psyche and history to be heard=20
simultaneously."

Underlining her interest in experimenting in all literary forms, last=20
year Ms. Jelinka wrote the libretto for an opera composed by Olga=20
Neuwirth, also an Austrian, which was based on David Lynch's enigmatic=20
movie "Lost Highway." "It's pretty much impossible to translate an=20
artwork like this into another genre," Ms. Jelinek said in an interview=20
at the time with The New York Times. "But musical theater is possible=20
because, like film, it is another way of playing with time flow."

While the form taken by her writing constantly shifts, however, its=20
fundamental purpose appears to be to disturb. As Agence France-Presse=20
quoted her as saying in a recent interview: "My writings are limited to=20
depicting analytically, but also polemically, the horrors of reality.=20
Redemption is the speciality of other authors, male and female."

Strange that you should say this. I'm reading Nietzsche for a class.=20

I read this quote last night in the preface of Birth of Tragedy:

"Socratic ethics, dialectics, the temperance and cheerfulness of the
pure scholar--couldn't these, rather than their opposites, be viewed as
symptoms of decline, fatigue, distemper, of instincts, caught in
anarchic dissolution? Or the "Greek serenity" of the later period as,
simply, the glow of a sun about to set? Or the Epicurean animus against
pessimism merely as the sort of precaution a suffering man might use?
And as for "disinterested inquiry," so called: what, in the last
analysis, did inquiry come to when judged as a symptom of the life
process? What were we to say of the end (or, worse, of the beginning) of
all inquiry? Might it be that the "inquiring mind" was simply the human
mind terrified by pessimism and trying to escape from it, a clever
bulwark erected against the truth? Something craven and false, if one
wanted to be moral about it? Or, if one preferred to put it amorally, a
dodge? Had this perhaps been your secret, great Socrates? Most secretive
of ironists, had this been your deepest irony?"

And last night made my own comment in the margins:=20

"Connection: back by popular demand, the (have a) positive attitude in
the US. The question still applies today."

I decided last night also: to begin a mad, passionate love affair with
Nietzsche this winter. Your coinciding e-mail fuels this fire.

Subject: Today's Awards

It strikes me with the Nobel and Poetry Magazine Awards being
announced in tandem today  that once
again Europe has honored intellectual tradition,  pessimism,
serious
ideas,  while our home-grown awards go to pithy, "lite"
versifiers.  Maybe
the  political climate (I just read an article stating that Bush
will probably
win because Americans want an optimistic president!!- torture and
invasions aside--) presides over
"official" poetry here too.

maxine is so right-

I do not know the nobel winner's work but it sounds innovative and worth
reading- Poetry Magazine has decided I guess to reward Milk and cookies
poets.  In the last issue of Poetry there was one poet who challenges me the
rest were a step above Hallmark cards;  the problem is that that so many
organizations in Poetry are taking the Dana Gioia (bad Italian) model of
"relevant and innocuous poetics"

I went to see the Motorcycle Diaries the other night and it was moving, more
for the scenery and the fact that I lived in South America and love it si
much but also because poetry and poets, Lorca, Neruda, Vallejo and Dario are
woven through the story all of them were attacked and even killed for their
poetry would any of the milquetoasts that Poetry magazine ever be
attacked for their poetry, of course not-

great news/// they've now ( ESPERANTO DISCS ) been thru  a few
incarnations  ( reissues to the layman)  they are truly manna from heaven
 except that i gave away my godz lps long ago   - incarnation one  base
lps italy  incarnation 2 zyx  germany   incarnation 3  getback  italy
and possibly one more and now stollman himself who i see at every avante
concert i attend doing it himself out in the open and actually adding new
stuff to the catalogue- (he ripped lots of musicians off you know)  Call
ME Burroughs    wow
rashied ali may have a new one comin out on it   ah the first one i owned
was bells i think by ayler or maybe it was the fugs broadside re-issue or
their second one  i've been collecting esp for yrs have every jazz lp
except  the peter lehmer one and maybe one other  alway avoided the rock
and folk stuff cept the fugs and the wonderfful pearls  before swine (
he's a lawyer now in boston and confessed to me once that he never got
high)
 now i want them all since folks like thurston and other rockers made
them fashionable  anyone out there w/ doubles or who just wanna get rid
of their old randy burns lps or evo  ( wow i need that one only have it
on cd ) or coach w/6 sides or movement soul  or that rare re-issue of
that rare charlie manson lp  or  or  even those 2 allen sondheim lps
which i sadly  used to pass upp   cause as zorn used to say of me i was a
jazz snob  but they gotta be vinyl under 35 bucks and originals  not
necessarily first pressing but on the real esp label

ah  ayler clear vinyl,   ah spiritual unity  ( speaking of which an aside
 new 10 cd ayler box set a must w/ 200 page book  repro of the famous
cricket mag  and other goodies like ayler playing in army  all for under
100$  )  ah  and speaking of which  i saw the fugs live to night at the
knitting factory w/ dear friend tuli who just had a b-day & is well over
80
( speaking of neglected) they rocked in their own fuggin way  i first saw
them in the village when i was maybe 17..

( like that  ian  song)  i learned the truth at.....blah blah blah so the
fugs did it and it's always nice to see poets at gigs     most don't hit
enough music gigs   here we had waldman  hollo  ( who did a fine reading
at po-project the other night along w/basil king) pettit and other
downtowners    dr n himself  who posed for a photo w/hollo  letting
by-gones  be  whatevers   anyway   esp  ESP's   my life well a big part
of it anyway and to think that i got to see alot of those guys play live
and even got to befriend some of them in a broad sort of way        -
anyway the fugs (ed sanders) and ran blake  managed to get the rights
back to their  lps and music that's why you never see them reissued by
stollman  or any of the others  tho fugs were on base before ed  got them
back  so they neve rgot royalties or anything  and to think stollman is a

excerpted from my blog (http://fishblog.blogspot.com):

So the Poetry Foundation has started figuring out what it's going to do with
its money. Big ups for rewarding obscure poets (though isn't that a
tautology?), and also for the $25,000 prize to Billy Collins (the Mark Twain
Award for humorous poetry). I can't think of anybody who deserves it more,
except for all the small presses and little magazines and high schools and
grade schools and poets who haven't been university professors, widely
published, and or/Poet Laureate.

I'm also excited by their plan to introduce a national recitation contest. This
will achieve the two important goals of a) restoring a vital element of 19th
century life to our completely different contemporary culture, and b)
instilling in kids everywhere the hatred for shit like that, which as we know
builds character, and will hopefully turn them to writing violent, anarchic
poems as a result (the secret agenda of the Foundation?).

And "the biggest baddest Web site for poetry out there" sounds pretty cool,
too. Hopefully it will take the best parts of other successful web sites and
synthesize them into something truly useful, in addition to the wonderful
service it will provide of "steer[ing] people to poems that they could use on
particular occasions like weddings."

And once they hire this secret agent to "place poems in niche magazines" then
watch the poems come rolling in to Yachting World, Men's Health, and Maxim.
More poems about the rich, vain, and tasteless will enhance the rich, vain, and
tasteless's aesthetic experiences and provide two contributor's copies to the
poor starving fucks who buy the magazines in efforts to research the lives of
the rich, vain, and tasteless... everyone's a winner!

the uselessness of poems


why would one write a poem . in a poem statements are
not to be taken at face value . everything is excused
. metaphors are always broken . the tropes are torpor
describe millennia ago . abstraction and codework or
oulipo tricks are those of dying form . to bear
witness implies the necessity of clear speech . the
language is already debased . nothing will bring it
back and we all know about the problematic of origins
. nothing stops the devolution of an increasingly
minor art . there is no reason whatsoever to
teach poetry in the school system . today the
average nursery-rhyme, already antiquated, says
more about culture and cultural context than any
contemporary poet . poetics is the last refuge of
the damned, always involved in recuperation . the
code-forms of traditional poetry are permanently
lost in the virtual digital and dawning world .
statements in poems are always already hyperbole
. to speak to each other is to speak to no one .
the poetry slam at least has the virtue of
contestation . poems are fearful of the world .
the contemporary world is all we have . the last
place one looks for testimony is the poem . the
poetry of previous centuries envelops us like
good late-night television . the condensation of
kennings and waka is destroyed by the infinity of
digital type . poet on one hand, rockhop on the
other as we go out singing . don't mistake
content . cleverness is the last refuge of the
poet . happy poems make good times of us all .
what at this point is the point of searching for
the word . i begin to write a poem: i sit at a
tablet in a certain position . language swirls in
the absence of content . the world demands
nothing of the poet . writers, no readers . with
charm the poet fools the poet . the crashed world
. we are our own victims of surplus . we are our
own surplus victims .

Found Poem: Tough as W

new job numbers are disappointingly low,
US arms inspector report says there were no WMDs,
increased terror attacks worldwide,
"It's hard work"
"We're making progress"
"The terrorists are getting desperate"
Come to think of it, the man IS tough:
imagine how much psychic energy it takes
to lie to the whole country
day after day

>From the Donald & Patricia Oresman Collection
Opening Reception: Friday, October 8, 6-8pm

Please join us for an exceptional exhibit of images culled from the
Oresman collection. Rodney Phillips curates a selection of over
thirty works of art, from Magritte to Brainard, Diebenkorn to Warhol,
representing wildly different styles and mediums but collectively
focused around the theme of people reading. "I think there is an
intensity to reading that captures artists' imaginations," Donald
Oresman says, "because it has a very private element to it." We
invite our readers to step into a public display of this private
endeavor, to enter into an evocative dialogue with artists who share
a love for the intimate act of reading.

Gay National Boycott Begins
  by Beth Shapiro
        365Gay.com Newscenter


(New York City) A one-day national work stoppage and economic boycott=20
called by a gay marriage advocacy group began Friday morning.

The Boycott for Equality called on gays and lesbians across the nation=20=

to drop out of the U.S. economy for the day by staying home from work,=20=

not shopping and not using cell phones.=A0

The boycott also asks people to withdraw $80 from their bank accounts=20
and hold onto the money to symbolize the average daily contribution of=20=

gay and lesbian people to the economy.

Estimates indicate that America's lesbian and gay population spends an=20=

average of $1.4 billion each day, totaling $500 billion a year. But,=20
the effect the grassroots effort to show the clout of the gay dollar=20
will have may not be fully known for several months when major=20
companies release financial reports.=A0

I was approaching it on the level of "formerly innovative things which now
suck." Though later, in the shower, I was thinking I should have said "the REM
of poetry" as they were always much more interesting to me than U2 until they
too began to suck.

I would also suggest, though tentatively, that many - including the band itself
- may consider U2 an institution of sorts.

Subject:      Bush is the Ike Turner of our political unconscious (but lacks
              even rhythm)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

After the last presidential debate I was called out on
another listserv (or music message board actually) for
demonizing Bush’s supporters and too easily dismissing
‘the intelligent, decent people who support him.’

I thought I would share my response here, because it
feels good to opine, ignore it as you likely will (it
certainly has no direct relation to poetics):

>>>
I have been thinking about Bush’s appeal, and have
come around to some sort of provisional (if
necessarily grand and simplified) theory on the
subject.

Ideological interpolation aside,* the appeal of
demagogues like Bush is precisely that they appeal to
_the worst_ in people.

It’s effective because it's a deep, authoritative
register to speak from, and I think people who appeal
to our worst instinctively seem honest and
trustworthy. He's _affective_. He’s like a
well-intentioned but abusive and overbearing father.
That _is_ his appeal.

He is the product of a deeply ingrained and perverse
social Imago.

He is Ike; the everyman, Tina. His supporters? Truly
scared little boys and girls. He pimps fear.

The decent people mentioned who support him are his
psychic whores.

John Stewart’s insights concerning ‘the anger of the
enfranchised’ after the Republican National Convention
are worth remembering.


Scare me daddy, protect me daddy.


This is so clear when 'W' is forced to present an
argument. He cannot. He was so shrill tonight. So
shrill he was almost cute. I wanted to put a blanket
around his shoulders and plop a cowboy hat on his head
and say reassuring things to him. Presumably Laura has
her hands full after these debates.



* I say again, I am Louis Althusser. Take my hand
descend into intellectual despair. Marry me. Die!

Three observations/afterthought "should-have-saids":

1. When Bush so vehemently defends his argument of strong leadership by
accusing Kerry of asking allies to rally around him in "the wrong war,
wrong time", or,  "a mistake",  Kerry may have corrected him by
stating: "Join me [to allies] in fixing the Bush administration's
mistake".

2. Bush called Senator Kerry "Senator Kennedy" at one point during the
debate. Soon after, he had a childish tantrum with Charlie Gibson over
his turn to respond.

3. When Bush stated at one point he was conservative and fiscally
responsible, I choked on my slice of pizza. I think my husband and I
both left room repeating "Oh my God! Did really he just say that????!"

The rest, as Kerry says: more of the same.

Fair enough.

If I were the devil I might counter that 'for all his
faults,' Bush has been a fine 'family man,' husband,
and father.

Of course, who knows?

Yes, REM, U2... or most any band housed as an institution
in that glass place in Cleveland... or hanging in any Hard
Rock Cafe's wall.

The music still shows some flashes (though often dervivative)
but it's often obscured by the pontification. Moby pulls
it all off with much more verve.

And, by the way, I still remember what U2 did to

I'm happy to announce the publication of my newest book: "The Healing =
Spirit of Haiku," co-authored with Jungian psychiatrist and writer David =
Rosen, and illustrated by Arthur Okamura.

Although "The Healing Spirit of Haiku" begins with a brief history of =
haiku, it is not a book about haiku. Rather, it is a combination of =
prose and haiku on a journey by two old friends through their respective =
lives.

Early praise for the book came from Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Thomas =
Moore, Robert Creeley, Edward Hirsch, and Claire Douglas.

North Atlantic Books, $14.95 paperback.

Many of us are saddened by the passing of this genius.  Yes, genius.  More
than anyone else in the philosopical and literary disciplines, Derrida informed
the second half of the 20th century.  I can't imagine what my own work might
look like without his influence.

Fare thee well, Jacques.

While not exactly pro-spousal abuse myself, I might counter that Ike
confined himself to slapping the shit out of Tina, not an entire country
and over 1,000 troops from the US alone. Granted, the excuses were
probably just as lame in both cases.

Also, Ike's music presumably did nothing to erode civil liberties in the
US, but then we never know.

I thought I'd combine these (reminds me those parlor games ben friedlander
used to play circa 1993 where he'd link poets with country musicians,
etc...)

1. Ah Gwyn, "you're just a fool, you know you're in love"!

2. And Aaron T. well at least U2 didn't name itself "MUSIC" or "ROCK MUSIC"
   or even, perhaps, "THE BAND"---maybe the BARRY MANILOW of poetry would
   come closer, "I am music and I write the songs" (which of course BM
   didn't write....)

Chris

P.S. "WANNA BUY SOME WOOD"??????

P.P.S----Would your hero ENO then be Rumsfield (oops, wrong analogy---
          I mean that woman who gave the money to POETRY?)





I was approaching it on the level of "formerly innovative things which now
suck." Though later, in the shower, I was thinking I should have said "the

they

I would also suggest, though tentatively, that many - including the band

If anyone reading this has the spare time and energy to get really mad, read the
obit on Derrida for the NY Times by Jonathan Kandell.  It is... truly a piece of

But again, a warning: don't read it until you're ready to be very angry.

It's been a while, like over a year since the last dust-up over semiotics
on this list. Since then I have had cause to remember my remarks to one
"Derek R" (who might be posting now as "derekrogerson"), because my ideas
on the subject have undergone some big changes. Derrida's passing seems a
good occasion to offer Derek my concession, and announce that I can no
longer uphold the principle of the post-Hellenic "sign" as the sole basis
for cognition and knowledge. No mystical grounds for this, just good sound
philology and multiculturalism. Forgive me if I don't go into detail.

So sorry about Derrida. I didn't know he was ill. I hope he didn't suffer. LRSN

To All, this is something I wrote earlier today and a friend asked me to send
it
to the Poetics list:


The news/obit stories I've read in English from the BBC, AP, AFP and the New
York Times have been unfortunately a bit ridiculous.  They chose to focus on
Derrida the scandal or the tidbits of his home life.  Probably many on this
list have read and heard enough of Derrida to decide in their own minds what
kind of influence he had. I just want to say a few things in tribute.

First, and most importantly, Derrida is a philosopher.  I won't make a big deal
about the distinction between philosophy and theory, but it is best said of
Derrida's work that it is a commitment to truth, ethics, and being, the three
great philosophical worlds (it would be too sad to see it simplified into the
incredibly boring "theory that everything is textual").  Derrida's
contribution was to put all these into
the "commmunity of the question" - which in an somewhat anarchic way meant to
question everything, though (differing from anarchy, or the idea that the text
has endless meaning) under the auspices of care and a communal connectedness of
thinking.  He called his philosophy "an-arche" in that it rejected firm origins
or predetermined lines of thought.  Instead, he took deeply serious the meaning
of philo-sophia as friendship and love.  It is not an accident that Derrida has
written touching elegies on just about all the philosophers of France of his
generation (Althusser, Barthes, Levinas, Deleuze, etc.).  Actually just about
all of Derrida's books are written in a kind of communal dialogue with a
particular philosopher or writer - he found a way of writing *with* and *among*
others that was not based on "critique" nor on strict methodological
pre-programs.  That his work became both a method and a convention of critique
in America drained much of the generosity of his thought and reduced it to fads
and ironies.

Though I probably would never have heard of him if it were not for this very
fad.  So I read him with much pleasure for both the poetry and the philosophy
that he insisted on thinking together.  I was a sophmore at Penn (1995) when I
first read him and I could not really understand much of what he was saying,
but I felt charged and wanted to know more -- who can ever say no to that?

A few years later, in Spring 2000, I was in Paris and had built my language
skills up enough to go to his seminar at the Ecole des hautes etudes.  The
seminar was on "the death penalty".  There
were a few hundred persons there.  Unless I arrived early I had to stand in the
back for the 2 hours or so.  Derrida spoke about the uses of technology in
administering death and spoke for a long time about the significance of the
guillotine for the revolution.  He would later speak for a while about Kant and
other opinions of philosophers on the death penalty.  He insisted that there
will be an end to the death penalty in the near future but wanted to ask how
this would change our thinking -- would we continue to understand death as a
kind of "penalty" or "pain" in general?  He had upper level students present
their own papers.  It was a pretty straightforward event, nothing earth
shattering.  I was somewhat disappointed.  I was maybe expecting something
more, more dramatic, but he was more patient and more curious than
that.  I saw him speak a few other times on various topics at one-day events in
Paris.  He had plenty to say but was not yelling or berating.  He spoke
eloquently and kindly, not much more.

Ok, he had his disciples with him wherever he went.  And he was obviously into
his own fashion.  Sometimes it was off-putting.  After a while I stopped going
to his seminars and went to hear other philosophers that were working in
other traditions.  That was ok, there were many other features of philosophy to
learn about, and I needed the change.

Paris is a city that loves its philosophers.  They are on tv and the radio and
in the newspapers every day.  Most philosphers pick a few areas of expertise,
also many rise thru the ranks by charging other philosophers with this or that
falsity.  A few philosophers take the care of thinking a bit more to heart.
Derrida is one of the rare philosophers to have such a range of thought, a way
of welcoming many different issues, styles, and cares in his work.  His work
above all focused on two major paradoxes or "impossible possibilities" as he
liked to call them: how to question reason (or being, or ethics, or X) while
remaining inside reason; and how to welcome and to give without expecting or
enforcing a gift or thanks in return.  There is no more generous thought than
that.

If you want to reduce deconstruction to one phrase, this is what I would offer:
how do you think and write otherwise, since otherness thinks and writes through
you?


-Joshua Schuster

--------------------


Also just want to include the text of the Le Monde interview in which Derrida
seemed to be saying goodbye.

The fact that we *have* been hearing this for decades sounds like a damned
good reason to be angry.

But I was grateful to read Joshua Schuster's tribute and hope more will appear
here.

personal bush


getting off of lexapro, sinister celexa, the dizziness becomes stronger
the more i focus on it. it's not so much dizziness as a sudden _shifting_
as if the saccadic movements of the eyes skipped a beat. it's the shifting
of the world, and it's accompanied by ill-forming short dreams, terror,
and emotions close to the surface. tonight for example, the presence of my
mother, dead over three years, was stronger than ever. i have a continuous
memorial light burning here; when the lights are out, it flickers; when i
shine a flashlight on it, it gains strength, sustenance, and burns
continuously. i figured out this is a result of additional imported energy
to the shell levels, but the result appears a miracle, one light feeding
off another. meanwhile the early morning headaches grow worse, imminent
behind the eyes. so you ask why i publish so much, cross-post? because of
my fear of death gnawing at me; everything must be done and done
immediately; there is no time to waste. i know if something isn't produced
and distributed _now_ it will never be; that piece of the puzzle will be
lost forever. it drives me. i'm obsessed with death and because of this
obsession i can also speak to the president and his popularity - the
reason became clear this evening, and sudden. it was in 2001 that my
mother died; that 9/11 occurred; that i lost the job in miami; that i
began taking celexa, the dextrous version of lexapro, full of immediate
side-effects that made me flee. it was an enormous depression, a _thing_
as kristeva might say, and i associate this _thing_ - of depression,
violence, death, of trauma - of post-traumatic shock syndrome - with both
comfort and imprinting; one has reached the limit, and it's there that
memory begins, holds fast, turns to long-term. imprinting inscribes and
circumscribes the thing; it's misery, but it's encapsulated. and during
our nation's weakest collective moment, with the towers falling, bush
appeared, this violent, stupid man created out of sound-bites - and in
that moment just a very few days later, standing in the rubble doing
nothing but feeling heroic, he became part of us, forever associated with
falling men and women, with the simultaneous moment of creation and
annihilation. just as some of us remember the day kennedy was shot, or
john lennon died, or 9/11 itself, so we remember the circumstance of the
man and his masquerade, as they all are, of the phallus, upright in the
ruins. and this imprinting occurred and still occurs within the chora, the
region of drives (the hole in ground zero is referred to as the _bathtub_)
- primordial, pre-linguistic, or the shuddered and stuttering beginnings
of the gesture itself. it's within this imaginary that the image appears,
that bush fumbles to the top, guarantees whatever safety, maternal and
otherwise, there is in the world - it's not a question of policy or his
incipient fascism - _it's not a question at all._ instead, it's a state, a
condition, that of the moment of trauma associated with salvation and the
proper name, beginnings of language from the always already ruined. bush
is here, he's within us, and for many americans, this is a kind of
salvation, ironically brought about in an unstable world bush himself is
partially responsible for. the circuit closes in on itself, strangles. no
wonder he's so far up in the polls, after failure after failure - the
guarantees he offers aren't linguistic, ideological - they're the
guarantees of presence itself, and presence references life, no matter how
denuded.

in the meantime, it is another long night of memories rising to the top,
of death breathing hard down the body, of a very real fear of attempted
sleep and its onslaught and slaughter. i won't rise to the occasion; i'll
fall to it, out of exhaustion. i'll be held and dropped, but at least i'll
be alive.

Full solo by Foofwa d'Imobilite on the roof of a Brooklyn building. This
is in part a response to avatar work by Sondheim; d'Imobilite movements
are described in avatar work of a furious nature which then return in a
furious nature to d'Imobilite movements. of this certain from neurasthenia
through neurosis. Filmed 1933, this Geneve "artiste" lives forever in

HAPPY BIRTHDAY THELONIOUS MONK   -- and please give peace a chance

fk all this  r&r stuff  sure  unfortunately  rock has made the single
most important  "artistic" impact in the 20th century  and basically
took control of everything  including the starving in africa  nice
gesture  and no one else in the liberal ART has the money or power to
make change and i love rock and roll and grew up on doowop ( now those
guys starved ) but enough  massaging  bono and stipes and the boyss
dylan the great  poet  died all those yrs just so he could make a
victoria secret  add  jonnny's in the basement tryin on his  hefty bra

yesterday  i saw a great louise bourgeouis show  directly across from a
show of john lennon's  drawings  some  altered by adding color  by his
greedy wife  ( she said that's r&r sometimes you have to make concessions
in that world  )  the money goes to thwe spirit foundation  does any one
know what that is

his wife certainly doesn't need his money  coming from the rockefellers
of japan  she was born  filthy rich   she sells her husband constantly
tho  even if it is for charity
sometimes

well there were 5 of us in louise's show  and about 100 of us  in john's
 and they were buyin those prints of his drawings like crazy  editions of
 300 to 1000  3000 bucks   6000 bucks   frames  xtra  some great original
erotica  from lennon  for 25 grand and up framed extra   well i miss ole
john  just like i miss malcolm and martin  and the other john  and james
dean and coltrane and pollack   all the suicides and murders  but hey
ease up on those  rockers  they get  too much   -  i can't wait to see
aurthur lee and love  with the zombies  next week   and then maybe i'll
take in a sonic youth set  and  leon russell if i can get a free ticket
   so don't get me  wrong  i love the stuff and  every obne's entitled to
make a living   even working class heroes   so how the hell do you spell
collanades  and  who the hell has a high psa  besides me??????

That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first

Kandell rescues the controversy from the grave.  I wouldn't mind so much if
he were merely documenting the usual "traditionalist" diarrhea.  We all know
that Derrida's assault on the tower made many ill.  But Kandell's own position
-- his use of words such as  "fashionable," "slippery," "murky" -- makes clear
his disdain for Derrida's methodology and for French intellectualism in
general.  He applies such words in equal measure to Existentialism and
Structuralism.  Clearly, given the current political situation, its "fashionable" to attack
the French.

It may be argued that Deconstruction exposed the "murkiness" of language.
However, there is nothing murky about Deconstruction.  That so many
traditionalists have found the methodology difficult to follow remains an indictment of
their own intellectual powers -- plain and simple.  Deconstruction "represents"
(in the street use of that term) ceaseless interrogation.  It does nothing --
absolutely nothing -- to disturb comfortable hierarchies, whatever the may be
at any one time, any one place.  It merely investigates/exposes the
contingencies of such hierarchies.  They remain in place within reason, within
metaphysics, apparently fixed/absolute, precisely because they are not.  If physicists
tells us that solid objects appear that way only due to forces generated by
electrons, they are applauded.  No one claims that this explanation is "murky."
When Derrida asserts that the solidity of language is similarly in question,
all hell breaks loose.

It won't work.  Derrida may have passed on, but he is not going away.  The
history of philosophy has depended for its forward movement on philosophers'
discovering logical inconsistencies in their predecessors.  To my knowledge --
despite traditionalist weeping and gnashing of teeth -- despite the not so well
concealed fear that the god of their metaphysics feels threatened -- no one
has debunked Derrida's project.

And that's that.

Best, Bill

Hey miekal,

Other guild members would probably define them differently, but for the
benefit of this list, I'd define broken word performance as a
post-language reconfiguration of the visual-kinetic "moment" in
contemporary arts and letters, and watermelon haiku as, to quote my
favorite one, "sweet, so juicy sweet"

Thanks for asking!

The NY Times obituary raises the issues of de Man and the Nazis, but the
one quote of de Man's writing as evidence of his collaboration is this:

"A solution to the Jewish problem that aimed at the creation of a Jewish
colony isolated from Europe would entail no deplorable consequences for the
literary life of the West."

Ironically -- or perhaps not -- this makes de Man sound like a Zionist.

Exactly my point(?)

Hence, Bush as the Ike (ie, manager/abusive lover) of
the American “political unconscious.”  You need to at
least read to the end of the post’s title. Or maybe I
need to trade in my mind for something more useful and
effective (perhaps a shoelace). I suspect it’s the
latter.

well---aside from the way derrida handled the de man scandal (i.e., i
didn't like the way he handled it, all in all), there's little
question to my way of thinking that he was one of the major thinkers
of our time...

and it's a little difficult to draw that conclusion from the
lamentable nytimes obit... the obit seems to mirror our (u.s.) public
domain in many ways, with its pooh-poohing of complexity and
difficulty and philosophical richness... "if only things were
simpler"... if only... by which i don't mean to suggest that i've
been taken by all of derrida's writings, or that i understand
entirely what he's about at all moments, or any of that... but that
he is someone with whom conscientious thinkers have had, sooner or
later, to contend, at some level---as things stand, i would find this
latter indisputable...

foucault btw died twenty years ago this year... i remember this in
part b/c twenty years ago this year, i decided to return to grad
school... so today i find myself reflecting on these past twenty
years, a period now flanked by the deaths of these two important
figures...

best,

But you've debunked it right here: saying that the contingencies
remain fixed precisely because they are not fixed is nice, simple,
straightforward nonsense, like saying red is blue precisely because
it is not. To analogize Derrida's writing to physics is to make a
predictable, and lamentable, mistake. Art is not science.

I, too, am very sad to learn that Jaques Derrida died in Paris on Friday.
He was a brilliant man, full of humor and wit, taught me to see what was
otherwise missing in my academic training (or provided me with what I
already knew but couldn't have articulated as well without his writing, or
at least my professors might not have heard me without his writing). My
husband, a philosopher, studied with him in the CUNY Comparative Literature
and French departments -- they wouldn't let Derrida teach in the philosophy
department!   My husband confirms to me what I got by meeting Derrida
briefly once: he was not only brilliant but kind, and a necessary
provocateur in the academy.

I am glad to know that poetry people are responding to that ridiculous
article in today's NYTimes.  This article is typical, reflecting the usual
desire for black and white truths that our culture is so obsessed with (and
which fuels the current presidential race, why George W. can repeatedly
accuse John Kerry of "flip flopping," and come off like a gun-slinging hero
to so many Americans -- embarrassingly, many of them women!).

I will not bother writing the Times these criticism, as they don't publish
my letters. Here I will say what I just e-mailed to another poet this
morning, that, in the realm of traditional ideas, the idea of having "an
idea in writing" is foreign.  Writing is supposed to be this clear lens, a
porous medium through which "pure" ideas radiate.  In other words (sounding
Derridian myself), in this concept of writing, writing doesn't exist.   I
wrote to my poet friend that Leslie Scalapino's writing is the poetry
version of Derrida's philosophy.  For her, writing is always its own
presence and existence.  For Derrida, philosophical and aesthetic ideas
only exist in the complex thicket of their own  writing (as experience).

Ultimately, I choose the discourse of poetry because it may be that only
"clear lens" that does, in fact, tell some kind of truth.  But in an
entirely different way than we typically conceive of "truth" as a prefab
set of ideas  (what deconstruction refers to as "binary thought" -- no
mention of that critical concept in the Times.)  I think the Times article
uses the word "complications," pejoratively, in reference to Derrida's
concept of "writing."  Wow.  Let's not have any "complications."  Let's
just go in there and bomb Iraq!

Laura Hinton

Not to mention it completely misses that deconstruction is a technique,
simply a device to get at the reality of "the other" that is always there,
in the writingl.

Irrespective of the humanities/sciences binary
(itself), tell David Chalmers that philosophy and
science donâ€™t overlap.

Meanwhile, what truly strikes me as nonsense is the
analogy between Billâ€™s point about deconstruction
and this cockamamie â€˜red is blue precisely because
it's notâ€™ rogue's herring.

This seems to be diametrically opposite what philosophical and
aesthetic ideas are all about for Derrida, who argued that such ideas
simply don't exist in anything resembling a complex thicket of their
own writing at all. The whole >point< of his work was to try to show
that there is no such thicket, complex or otherwise, and no lens, and
no truth. He argued that there is only the contingency of the
reader's/audience's response, which depended entirely on things other
than what the writer was trying to say in the text itself. That this
is simple nonsense doesn't mean that it should be retrospectively
revised, as you seem to be trying to do, at this late date.

  But in

That's because Derrida's accusation that all thought other than his
own was "binary thought" is as much nonsense as the notion that he
could communicate the idea that one cannot communicate ideas by
writing by writing that one cannot communicate ideas by writing.

Bill:

I'm sure you overlooked the inconsistency in your argument, and didn't mean
it that way.

That aside, language is used in the everyday realm, while particle physics
isn't. That's why writers are more dangerous than physicists, except maybe
physicists with Edward Teller's beliefs. Deconstruction is laughed off by
the popular press because they fear it. After all, journalists have the
illusion that what they say is factual, although anyone who has attended an
event that was in the news knows that there's always a gap between what they
saw and what was written or broadcasted, just like there's no direct line
between signifier and signified.

apparently my "how poems work" on John Newlove's last published poem,
"THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN," has just appeared as part of the
online content of Arc magazine.

http://howpoemswork.arcpoetry.ca/_features/2004_october_mclennan.php

For those that don't know his work, he was considered "the best lyric
poet in Canada from 1962 to 1972."

Also, Moments, Not Monuments: Remembering John Newlove is now available
through www.bywords.ca

        "Moments, Not Monuments is a limited edition volume celebrating the
        poignant poetry of John Newlove, who died in December 2003.
        Contributors include Steve Artelle, Aidan Baker, Gary Hyland, rob
        mclennan, Colin Morton, Pearl Pirie, J.C. Sulzenko, Gordon Phinn and Rob
        Thomas. Moments, Not Monuments features poems reprinted from John
        Newlove's Moving In Alone and Apology for Absence. Money raised
        through sales of the issue will go toward funding the annual John
        Newlove award and the publication of a chapbook for the winner."

John Newlove's last fourteen poems, from the 13 published in the chapbook
THE TASMANIAN DEVIL and other poems (above/ground press, 1999) as well as
the piece "THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN" can be found in the anthology
"Groundswell: best of above/ground press, 1993-2003" (Broken Jaw Press,

C'mon, Marcus.  Read carefully.  I wrote that the "hierarchies" (the plural
noun closest to the pronoun "they," and therefore its reference) remain in
place "within reason, within metaphysics," "apparently fixed/absolute."  Your
rendition of the red/blue thing is nonsense because you've constructed it as such.
 That example has nothing to do with what I said.

So let's try another, very simple, example.  The number "1" leads a hierarchy
in which it occupies the first position.  But that apparent privilege is
possible only because the other numbers simultaneously exist with the system.  The
number "1" would obtain no privilege as "first" if there were no other
numbers.  "First" would be meaningless in that case.  The meaning of "first" is
possible only because second, third, etc., come simultaneously into play.  Ergo,
first is apparently first because it is not first.  No term can "mean" outside
of a language system.  It is therefore also sensible to say that the system
occupies each term.  Without a system of contingencies, there can be no apparent
fixity.  The identity of red is contingent upon blue which in turn is
contingent upon ... you get the picture.  There is no red without blue since blue is
within red; "blue" is part of a language system which occupies "red" in order
for "red" to mean as "red."  We are not talking here about how light bends.
We are talking about how bent light becomes meaningful for us, how language
makes bent light meaningful so we can identify it, think about it, talk about it.
 "This aspect of "differance," long concealed by the absolutism of
metaphysics (perhaps we may blame Plato, Aristotle, et al), Derrida exposes.  We cannot
escape metaphysics, but we can understand why and how such thinking is
possible, even necessary.

I don't think this is difficult.  But Marcus, ya gotta be fair to what I
write.

What can I say about your absolute distinction between art and science?  Is
philosophy art?  Derrida was a philosopher, so I'm not getting your point.
Since, for both philosophy and science, mathematics/logic is crucial, I'll grant
only that the comparison is indeed predictable.  How can it be otherwise?
It's worth pointing out that science -- its meaningfulness (empirical or
otherwise) -- occurs only in language.  As far as we can tell, there is no science in
a goldfish's world.  You can take it from there.  By the way, I know two
Professors of Physics from Cambridge who are very sympathetic to the notion that
art and theoretical science have more in common than not (given the limitations
of Empiricism at the subatomic level), and who greatly admire Derrida.  So
"absolutisms" such as "art is not science" are always open to interrogation, to
deconstruction.

Anyway, I've said enough.  I had no intention of saying this much.  The obit
portrays Derrida in a less than flattering light, to be sure.  As far as I'm
concerned, Kandell took the event of Derrida's death to minimize a brilliant
man's achievement. I am not bothered by Kandell's hauling out a litany of worn
out, rather conventional confusions.  That's reportage.  It happened.  It is
part of Derrida'a story.  I am bothered by Kandell's personal bias which should
have no place in an obit.

Oh well, I'll live.  And so will Derrida.

Best, Bill

Morning specter.  An appearance.
Pulling an other towards. Justice.
Derrida heard the radio-captured battlefield, recognized a name,
understood language.
At last, in death, the guarantee of singularity.
As violent as the naming when born,
his name in death which undoubtedly is.

thanks for that piece, barrett... not that i've ingested it wholesale
(that would take more time), but in reading through rather quickly, i
can say that i have similar reservations re the sweep of derridean
thought, and that derrida's work should nonetheless be defended as an
important contribution to intellectual openness and integrity, and
(if i may) as a gesture toward the requisite poiesis of the critical
function, w/o which, as ihab hassan observed so long ago, that
function can so easily become "a spite of mind"...

best,

joe

I'm really an innocent in these matters, but it seems to me there are some
holes in your logic. I have no idea if these reflect similar holes in
Derrida's, as I've read precious little of him.

To demystify, how about "'first' is a hierarchical distinction. It would
not be possible without the simultaneous existence of that within which it
is distinguished." Easy as pie. How about "first is apparently first
because it is not first" achieves mystification of the obvious (for what
purpose?) by mixing without explanation two meanings of the letter
combination "first": as a combination of letters, and as a statement of
priority within a hierarchy. So it's a pun. One likes that sort of
cleverness or finds it annoying. Chacun a son gout.

As to "blue," suppose instead we were to say "light of a wavelength (or
"reflected light of a wavelength) of 475 nm?" Still to be sure within
language, but no longer a statement of comparison--if "red" didn't exist
475 nm would.

I understand what your physicist friends meant--I've had the same
conversation. The difference is that the physicist's intuitive reach
remains useful only until it's shown to be inconsistent with the phenomena
it attempts to describe. Art as we generally understand it is not
susceptible to proof or disproof in the same sense.

Read it and weep

Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74
By JONATHAN KANDELL

Published: October 10, 2004
Jacques Derrida, the Algerian-born, French intellectual who became one of
the most celebrated and notoriously difficult philosophers of the late 20th
century, died Friday at a Paris hospital, the French president's office
announced. He was 74.

The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, according to French television,
The Associated Press reported.

Mr. Derrida was known as the father of deconstruction, the method of inquiry
that asserted that all writing was full of confusion and contradiction, and
that the author's intent could not overcome the inherent contradictions of
language itself, robbing texts - whether literature, history or philosophy -
of truthfulness, absolute meaning and permanence. The concept was eventually
applied to the whole gamut of arts and social sciences, including
linguistics, anthropology, political science, even architecture.

While he had a huge following - larger in the United States than in Europe -
he was the target of as much anger as admiration. For many Americans, in
particular, he was the personification of a French school of thinking they
felt was undermining many of the traditional standards of classical
education, and one they often associated with divisive political causes.

Literary critics broke texts into isolated passages and phrases to find
hidden meanings. Advocates of feminism, gay rights, and third-world causes
embraced the method as an instrument to reveal the prejudices and
inconsistencies of Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Freud and other "dead
white male" icons of Western culture. Architects and designers could claim
to take a "deconstructionist" approach to buildings by abandoning
traditional symmetry and creating zigzaggy, sometimes disquieting spaces.
The filmmaker Woody Allen titled one of his movies "Deconstructing Harry,"
to suggest that his protagonist could best be understood by breaking down
and analyzing his neurotic contradictions.

A Code Word for Discourse

Toward the end of the 20th century, deconstruction became a code word of
intellectual discourse, much as existentialism and structuralism - two other
fashionable, slippery philosophies that also emerged from France after World
War II - had been before it. Mr. Derrida and his followers were unwilling -
some say unable - to define deconstruction with any precision, so it has
remained misunderstood, or interpreted in endlessly contradictory ways.

Typical of Mr. Derrida's murky explanations of his philosophy was a 1993
paper he presented at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, in New York,
which began: "Needless to say, one more time, deconstruction, if there is
such a thing, takes place as the experience of the impossible."

Mr. Derrida was a prolific writer, but his 40-plus books on various aspects
of deconstruction were no more easily accessible. Even some of their
titles - "Of Grammatology," "The Postcard: From Socrates to Freud and
Beyond," and "Ulysses Gramophone: Hear Say Yes in Joyce" - could be
off-putting to the uninitiated.

"Many otherwise unmalicious people have in fact been guilty of wishing for
deconstruction's demise - if only to relieve themselves of the burden of
trying to understand it," Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New
York University, wrote in a 1994 article in The New York Times Magazine.

Mr. Derrida's credibility was also damaged by a 1987 scandal involving Paul
de Man, a Yale University professor who was the most acclaimed exponent of
deconstruction in the United States. Four years after Mr. de Man's death, it
was revealed that he had contributed numerous pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic
articles to a newspaper in Belgium, where he was born, while it was under
German occupation during World War II. In defending his dead colleague, Mr.
Derrida, a Jew, was understood by some people to be condoning Mr. de Man's
anti-Semitism.

A Devoted Following

Nonetheless, during the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Derrida's writings and
lectures gained him a huge following in major American universities - in the
end, he proved far more influential in the United States than in France. For
young, ambitious professors, his teachings became a springboard to tenure in
faculties dominated by senior colleagues and older, shopworn philosophies.
For many students, deconstruction was a right of passage into the world of
rebellious intellect.

Heh. The U2 single is one of the best things they (N-land or U2, for that
matter) ever did. I remember hearing it at 2 am on the Emerson College station
and being blown away.

Did you ever read the interview between N-land and The Edge, in Mondo 2000?
Very interesting. http://www.negativland.com/edge.html

Proof

'sneer' seems to have a space between s and n first line middle - the
double arrow <--> doesn't read that way because of the type - can you use
a symbol here? same on type line from bottom, every-thing change to
everything can you change the italics of "in this sentence" to "_in this
sentence_"? The underline would go better with the rest of the typography
in this piece. line of type, please change "west" to "West" at the bottom
of : "Am Ursprung gibts kein Plagiat" (Karl Kraus) - please if possible
put this on the Dedication as well. maybe put "TERMI NAL" on a line by
itself: TERMINAL from bottom - need parenthetical closure after "spatial"
middle - you might want to use arrow symbols here as well very top of -
since this is untitled, it seems a continuation of - maybe capitalize
HONEY:> NOTHING WORKS IN THIS SPACE, - just that far, as indicative of a
new piece. not sure but there seems a slight opening between lines and
third line - please take out "(changed the name)" - it seems self-evident
- rd paragraph, from third sentence - can we change to "Wild theory is
pierced, penetrated. The piercings" - then include the rest of the
paragraph. In other words, take out the ref. to grrrl theory. is a sonnet
of lines plus . But here the justifying makes a bit of a mess of it.
Perhaps you can run it sideways - some way to preserve the original lines?
Smaller type? down about a third - change "oopback" to "loopback" - please
note about / of the way down, where "Member name" and the next two lines
are - they're misaligned, check the ms? Same near bottom where the
____media____ and the next line is - they should be on the same line -
please check the syntax here? for example second line, you have _=-; it
should be either _=_ or -=-. The whole needs checking. there's odd
alignments of "Alan sings o/~" - I wonder if this can be rejustified? If
not, it's ok - you might check the alignment of this with the original -
it's a bit off. Will do, however -

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 24, 7:30
JOANNE KYGER & MICHAEL ROTHENBERG

Joanne Kyger has been a huge figure in outrider poetry for some four =
decades now. As Ron Silliman has said, "She's one of our hidden =
treasures&emdash;the poet who really links the Beats, the Spicer Circle, =
the Bolinas poets, the New York School and the Language Poets, and the =
only poet who can be said to do all of the above." She's published some =
twenty books of prose and poetry, including The Tapestry and the Web, =
Going On: Selected Poems 1958-1980, Just Space: Poems 1979-1990, Again, =
and her new book As Ever, edited with a foreword by Michael Rothenberg =
and an introduction by David Meltzer.=20

Michael Rothenberg is a poet and songwriter. His songs have been on the =
tracks of several motion pictures; the broadside of his poem "Angels" =
was printed in a limited edition as part of the Country Music =
Foundation's museum resources. Editor of Joanne Kyger's As Ever, he was =
also the editor of Overtime: Selected Poems of Philip Whalen, to whom =
his new book of poems, Unhurried Vision is dedicated and whom he =
celebrates in poems that form a daybook of a year in his own life. =
Rothenberg is editor and co-founder of Big Bridge Press and Big Bridge, =
an online magazine. Donation: $2.

could anybody point to a passage in Derrida's texts where he argues that
all thought "other than his own"  is "binary thought"?

Yep and yep.  Thanks Joel.  I did believe that the inconsistency was caused
by a misread pronoun reference.  However, since the "They" begins a sentence, I
really can't blame anyone for misreading.  The reference is, at best, vague.
I probably should have written "They [the hierarchies] remain in place" for

What i found interesting in the Times bit was the capitalization of East
Coast universities in this passage:

"By the late 1980's. Mr. Derrida's intellectual star was on the wane on
both sides of the Atlantic. But he continued to commute between France and
the United States, where he was paid hefty fees to lecture a few weeks
every year at several East Coast universities and the University of
California at Irvine"

Er, excuse me but your ideological subtext is showing.

Actually, I was taught and turned on to this stuff by European profs when
doig a comp. lit degree. One Romanian told me that Theory was better than
sex. And he fucked everybody.

Actually what I'm going to find and read again is Nietzsche's "On Truth
and Falsity". I recall that as a forerunner to deconstruction proper (but
then again Pseudo D the Aeopagite plants the seeds.)

That all said, I'm appreciating the reflections posted here.

bests,
kevin

"It [deconstruction] merely investigates/exposes the contingencies of
such hierarchies.  They remain in place within reason, within
metaphysics, apparently fixed/absolute, precisely because they are
not."

Even admitting that the "They ..." could refer either to
contingencies or hierarchies, and that you intended that "They" to
refer to hierarchies, not contingencies, it still seems to me that it
is well within the spirit of Derrida's notions, and his multiple
muddle expressions and withdrawals from expressions of them, to say
that deconstruction investigates the contingencies that remain fixed
precisely because they are not fixed.

Further, though, and perhaps even more in the spirit as well as,
perhaps, closer to something like the letter of Derrida=92s muddy
exposition, your intent to mean whatever you intended to mean is
worthless in the face of my, the reader=92s, interpretation of what you
said. You are merely the writer, and your opinion is as nothing
compared to the reader=92s real creation of the real meaning, for the
reader, of the meaning of the text. That is to say, you see, that
whatever >I< say you mean is really what you >do< mean, because
according to the very ideas you=92re trying to expound, your exposition
is meaningless in the face of my interpretation of it. This sort of
humpty-dumpty-ism is way beyond recursion and well into the heart of
nonsense.

Be that as it may, though, I'll take you to mean, as you now say you
intended, that it is the hierarchies "that remain fixed precisely
because they are not." Unfortunately for your argument, and for
clarity too, this still makes no sense. It's hard to see how
hierarchies, however comfortable, can remain fixed "precisely because
they are not [fixed]" -- or how anything else outside the quantum
realm could, either. Even if you, or Derrida, or you both mean this
to be taken metaphorically as an allusion to the quantum realm, the
analogy fails dramatically since there is no fit analog between real
human hierarchies and theoretical natural-quantum effects. Even if
that's what you mean, it's simply a bad analogy, a bad metaphor,
since the kind of uncertainty physicists speak of in the quantum
world is simply non-existent in the human world. No matter how
persuasive you think you are, or how right you think deconstruction
theory to be, you simply cannot argue the bullet into not killing you
by citing the fact that it is more air than material, and that
knowing its speed makes knowing its location only a probability.

The meaning of "first" is ostensive: we understand "first" to be
meaningful within the context of the language we speak only where
there is in fact a hierarchy and a number -- and "first" is not
necessarily a privileged position, either. Something can be, and
often is, "first" merely because it is closest, not because it is
biggest or best. Other times it=92s ironic, as in "I=92m your first
father" where a child has had no other father, or "I=92m your first
cousin" where not only is the relation between the two that of "first
cousins" but they are each the others=92 first first cousin, and the
dropping of the repetition is a form of word-play. What words mean is
contextual, not absolute. Even in math and science the position of
the number creates the meaning of the number, not merely the writing
of it.

There is no apparent fixity. There is only flux and contingency,
context and relation. What creates meaning is the ordering of the
contingency, the recognition of relation, the significance of the
context, the flow of the flux. This view was ancient millennia before
Derrida was born -- it is nothing of Derrida=92s, and Derrida added
nothing to it but confused terminology and muddled verbal messes that
he pretended explained because, by being such bad examples of
explanations, they demonstrated the difficulty of explaining the
difficult.

Concealed from whom? It takes no muddling about by Derrida to
"expose" such an obvious thing. Besides, Plato spent his philosophic
career writing dialogs that specifically and explicitly go on and on
and on and on about how what we perceive as "real" things are mere
shadows of "ideal" things to which they are only and merely
relational and relative and approximate. Where do you get this "blame
it on Plato" business?

Further, "red" and "blue" describe light of particular wavelengths
whether there is light from other wavelengths present (or even
existent) or not; and ultraviolet and infrared exist whether we can
see them or not, as any sunburn sufferer can tell you after spending
too much time exposed on a cloudy day. The words we use are
conventions by which we try to coordinate our perceptions with those
of others. People who cannot see red still see shades of grey that
they can, with experience, learn to call "red" even though they see
nothing like what people who see red see. For such people "blue"
exists even though "red" does not, and even though they=92ve learned to
call some shades of grey that they cannot see as red "red".

> We cannot escape metaphysics, but we can understand why and
> how such thinking is possible, even necessary.<

Who was trying to escape metaphysics? Quantum mechanics is
metaphysics when you come right down to it. Is the cat alive or dead?
Is it the speed or the position that we know, or want to know?

> What can I say about your absolute distinction between art and
> science?<

Art and science are terms we use to describe what we describe in
context, and the contexts change. Metaphorically anything can be an
art: "the art of bridge-building", but it=92s only a metaphor -- though
in a time before the principles of engineering were understood, or
during a time when they were not well understood, bridge-building
certainly depended more on intuitive understandings of the problems
of materials and stresses than on calculations about them.

Art is about the relations between and among people; science is about
the relations between and among things -- but don=92t deliberately
misunderstand me, and try to make it out that I=92ve said there is no
relation between people and things!

The smallest amoeba, much less a goldfish, has to grasp principles
such as traction, friction, repulsion, grasping, and the like simply
to move and ingest and excrete. Is there science in a goldfish=92s
world? There certainly is, for successful goldfish who survive to

and find food. Would you rather call that art? Instinct? What?

The notion that art and theoretical science have more in common than
not is a metaphorical argument, not an assertion that art and science
are the same, as "poetry in motion" is a metaphor, and not an
assertion that someone=92s movement is actually poetry. This perennial
conflation of the metaphoric with the non-metaphoric, whether
deliberate or mistaken, is the source of a great deal of confusion in
discussions of this kind. Just because someone uses the word "red"
doesn=92t mean they=92re a Communist; and just because someone uses the
word "art" doesn=92t mean they=92re an artist.

Dear editor,

Aldon,

It's just so odd that of all the things they quote, it's something that is
actually quite ambiguous -- or at least can be directed towards Zionists
for their own metaphysical adherence to separatist mentality, since it is a
statement that could easily have been said by Jabotinsky or the young
Begin.  Talk about slippage!

Yes, Tate is a good example of selective blindness.

All of this to underscore that there are two Derrida discussions.  There is
the intellectual discussion and debate over his legacy -- about which there
are all sorts of fruitful positions -- and then there is the official
discussion, which revolves around suspicion and outright hostility of
intellectuals in general and of the French in particular (despite the fact
that as an Algerian Jew Derrida was himself an ambiguous Frenchman).

All newspapers have style sheets. The Times' style sheet capitalizes East
Coast and West Coast equally, treating them as proper nouns.

yknow marcus, your zeal in attempting to dismiss derrida's value
outright seems a bit... overzealous (you use a variation of "muddled"
three times, i think)... esp. in that you show such little interest
in taking issue with specific derridean texts... you seem to be more
interested in making categorical pronouncements about art, science,
and so forth... take, for instance,

"Art is about the relations between and among people; science is about
the relations between and among things...."

i can imagine a significant amount of pixels devoted to debunking
that chestnut alone...

but i'm not posting to get into this with you -- not really... i
think rather that i'd like to float here what my former colleague,
the late ron sukenick once wrote about theory generally:  that, if
nothing else, theory had "made literary life, on the whole, a lot
more interesting"... and of course, as a primary exponent of
continental theory, derrida was among those whom ron had in mind...

hasn't theory made literary life a lot more interesting, finally?...
or would you rather that we return to the 50s version of literary
criticism? (i reserve a soft spot in my heart for frye, actually)...
or would you rather that we sidestep literary criticism and theory
wholesale?... i'm just not certain i understand what it is about
derrida, or his oeuvre, that bugs you so...

peace,

joe

Seance

a 2 day public meditation on the condition of
language and narrative in contemporary writing.

OCTOBER 29 & 30, 2004, at REDCAT, The Roy and Edna Disney CalArts
Theater in downtown Los Angeles.

Our S=E9ance in Experimental Writing gathers new and established
writers to speculate on the boundaries of structural and linguistic
experiments today. Participants include novelists, short-story
writers, poets, and hypertextualists, from Canada, the US, and
Europe: Dodie Bellamy, Charles Bernstein, Jaap Blonk, Christian Bok,
Dennis Cooper, Madeline Gins, Robert Gluck, Kenneth Goldsmith,
Shelley Jackson, Kevin Killian, Ben Marcus, Eileen Myles, Joan
Retallack, Cristina Rivera Garza, Steven Shaviro, Janet Sternburg,
and Lidia Yuknavitch. The panels are:

Pataphysics: Science, Fiction and Imaginary Solutions.  Fiction often
proposes imaginary solutions to problems that vex both the social and
the scientific world.  For every rule there seems to be an exception,
and to every episteme an extreme.  Imagine the impossible.  Can the
world be re-written?  If science is metaphysical is poetry a form of
math?

Egoplasm: The Ghost of the Author Returns.  Even though the author is
dead, anyone can tell the difference between a poem by Jackson  Mac
Low and Steve McCaffery.  Is the writing machine always haunted by
its author? Need it bear repeating that just when women and non-white
writers establish their literary self, straight white men declare to
them that the subject is dead.  Can the author really be made to
disappear?  Should he or she disappear?  Are new subjectivities being
created?

What's love got to do with it? Sex & Desire in Narrative.  For more
than a generation, sex and sexual desire have been the sine qua non
of experimental writing.  Is desire still relevant?  Is sex obsolete?
Can lust create identity? Do readers want to be aroused and can
writers still arouse them? Why has the urgency of the human body been
so fertile for writers, and where will this excitement lead us next?

Ethernity - to Infinity and Beyond!  From the chemistry of letters to
the double-helix and the periodic table of elements. Is there
structure beyond structuralism?  Are structures of language and
narrative more real than 'reality'? Do extreme patterns lead away
from or toward paranoia?  Intricate lattices of poetry:  the inter-,
meta-, pata-, and the trans-.

Absolutely Ordinary: Writing the Everyday.  To the ontological
question 'what is there?' the usual answer is: the desk, my chair,
the air, the past=8A everything.  Writers have a dual relation to the
everyday.  It is everywhere, in their work and in its making, yet is
also always evades them.  From Flaubert's housewife's fantasies to
Kenneth Goldsmith's transcription of every movement in his day, the
everyday never goes away. What is quotidian today?  Is there a secret
life of objects? How do/ can/ will writers represent the ordinary?

Hi Marcus,

Whew!  What a rant!  A couple of points. =20

You confuse deconstruction with reader response theory.  If you want to mock=
=20
Derrida with Stanley Fish, fine.  But your rebuttal is hardly "closer to the=
=20
letter" of Derrida's, or my, exposition.

<<your intent to mean whatever you intended to mean is

worthless in the face of my, the reader=E2=80=99s, interpretation of what yo=
u

said. You are merely the writer, and your opinion is as nothing

compared to the reader=E2=80=99s real creation of the real meaning, for the

reader, of the meaning of the text. That is to say, you see, that

whatever >I< say you mean is really what you >do< mean, because

according to the very ideas you=E2=80=99re trying to expound, your expositio=
n

is meaningless in the face of my interpretation of it. This sort of

humpty-dumpty-ism is way beyond recursion and well into the heart of

nonsense.>>

Huh?  Where in my remarks, or Derrida's, is the reader's whim privileged? =20
Nowhere does Derrida claim that texts are meaningless.  Quite the opposite,=20=
ther
e is nothing but meaning.  If you are suggesting (hard to tell) that authori=
al=20
intention trumps the text, I believe the Intentional Fallacy took care of=20
that one way back when.  Check the New Criticism.

With regard to Quantum Physics and art, unless you believe that words=20
correspond, without any sort of mediation, to objects in the world, you must=
 grant=20
that all knowledge is metaphorical.  So much for that.  The issue of the Qua=
ntum=20
vs. Art I have dealt with in another post.

Your point about Plato's shadows doesn't fly.  As most religions claim, the=20
material world is fallen, and certainly in relation to god.  Nevertheless, g=
od=20
is absolute.  The Ideal?  Final Cause?  Plato and Artistotle were both=20
absolutists.  That's the point.  That's where I get it.  By the way, Plato a=
lso=20
claimed that a man's most authentic conversation with himself takes place ou=
tside=20
of language.  If you can find a way to talk to yourself without language, le=
t=20
us know.

And with regard to my comment that Derrida exposes what is concealed in=20
metaphysics. <<Concealed from whom? It takes no muddling about by Derrida to

"expose" such an obvious thing.>>

Really?  That's good to know.  But then why all this debate?  If Derrida and=
=20
deconstruction are so obvious, why all the antagonism?  Why that nasty obit?

Feel better.  Best, Bill

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I thought I'd share a "homeland security" incident. I was taking photos in
downtown New Orleans this morning when I saw some interesting shadows on a
building (a bank, I think). So I started snapping and a security guard came
out and yelled at me that I can't take photos of the building. I told her
that I was in a public place and could take photos, nothing illegal about
that. She went back inside the building and came out with a male security
guard, who gave me the same admonishment. I repeated that I could indeed
take photos in a public place.

He then instructed the woman to call the police. I asked him what law I was
violating. He backed down and told her to call "management" and barked at
me to stay right where I was. I told him that I would not stay put, that I
was free to come and go as I pleased (I know, it's not the best thing to
talk back! I wouldn't say that to a cop). I went about my business of
taking pictures. No management came out, but they kept surveilling me. I
walked away, thinking I had put the episode behind me.

Several blocks later, I started taking pictures of some patterns on the
sidewalk. I looked up and there were the two security guards taking
pictures of me! I waved, smiled, took pictures of them and walked on.

I hope this doesn't get me on a no-fly list!

These are really his shoes, and his voice was emanating from the

Hi Camille - that's a kind of scary story. I am glad you stood those folks
down. I suspect what we will all continue to experience more & more of this
(as the Homeland S funding goes up) & they hire more and more high school
diploma or less people who will be making 'constitutional' decisions without
having much more than a pale version of a civics glass. Like Abu Graib -
when they start shooting - and eventually someone(s) undoubtedly will,  and
dead bodies appear slouched over digital cameras or bulges in their coats -
these same folks/guards will complain they were just following orders and
never given the opportunity to learn anything about United States
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, etc. Just following Bush in the global
fight against terror.
I suspect that to psychologically disarm these folks without being
dangerously provocative will become a learned and daily skill.

In about 90 x percent of the country, these must be the most boring jobs
imaginable. Predation on citizens will undoubtedly make it all more fun and
interesting. Surveillance quotas will make things quantifiable and please
bosses and congressional funders in the next round. An old story whose
bureaucratic structures will unfortunately will take years to purge from
this or any country.

Judith Goldman - a poet here in the Bay Area - gave a very powerful reading
at the Poetry Center last week where she - in part - re-loomed the language
of the Faye Report on Abu Graib, the Enron-Duke etc. energy manipulation
trader conversations (and probably a bunch of other gov testimony
documents). It was a masterful (mistressful?) unveiling, concrete almost to
a fault - yet infused with her ironic, beyond distressed humor in the face
of the practically unbelievable (maybe imagine Nazi) cold,stark killing
nature of the language and those who use it as an active sub rosa war
instrument.

Hell hath no fury like an evangelical of any sort looking for provocation!
One fears. I pray, too!

This raises the following queries to my
(under-schooled) mind:

a) Is language predicated on the unspeakable or vice
versa? Or are language and the unspeakable mutual
coefficients?

b) Is Kristeva’s semiotic chora horseshit?

c) Am I having a conversation with myself when I
masturbate?

d) What happens to my lap when the cat has my tongue?

e) Was Helen Keller in the phonebook?

Subject:      Culturenet Sweden faces sudden shutdown
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hello all,

This might seem a bit esoteric to some of you, but those interested
in Swedish culture will hopefully also find this interesting.

Culturenet Sweden (http://www.kultur.nu) - a large web portal giving
the Swedish people access to all kinds of culture - is now being shut
down by the government after nine years of existence.

Below is a petition text about this for English speaking
international friends of the Culturenet. I know there are plenty of
them, who have been inspired by Sweden when building their own
culturenets.

This text might be sent - as is or in modified form - to The Cultural
Committee of the Swedish Parliament as well as to the Swedish
Government, the Ministry of Culture. How to do this is explained
below.

And you may of course forward this e-mail to other potential protesters ...

There is also a longer, more descriptive, article version of the text
that may be re-published freely, electronically or in print. The
article version is available at this URL:
http://home5.swipnet.se/~w-56585/article.html

Your support would be much appreciated!

Best regards,

Karl-Erik Tallmo
writer, artist, poet, Sweden

Subject: To the Swedish Government & Parliament
=======================================================






=================== Petition text: ====================


To:

The Cultural Committee of the Swedish Parliament
The Swedish Government, the Ministry of Culture



DON'T SHUT DOWN CULTURENET SWEDEN!

(http://www.kultur.nu)

In the latest finance bill the Swedish government proposes that
Culturenet Sweden - a large portal giving the Swedish people access
to all kinds of culture - should be shut down as of December 31, 2004.

The authority that hosts Culturenet Sweden - the Swedish National
Council for Cultural Affairs - declares on its official web page that
they share the government's view.

The proposal has surprised institutions and organizations as well as
individuals working within the cultural sphere - not just in Sweden
but also internationally.

Through the years Culturenet Sweden has built a large systematically
organized catalogue of links to all sorts of Swedish culture;
artists, musicians, writers, actors, theater groups, dancers,
libraries, archives, museums, galleries, book stores, antiquarian
book sellers, governmental agencies concerned with cultural matters,
organizations, research, education etc. Right now, in the Fall of
2004, the link catalogue contains approx. 8 000 links.

The information in the link catalogue is highly refined and
systematized. This service is augmented by a mailinglist hosting
service, a notice board where anybody may advertise their cultural
events or achievements, a unique press release service, the services
"Ask a librarian", and "What happens?", the latter an online
calendar, listing current events, and finally an online cultural
magazine.

Culturenet Sweden is a cultural community, attracting several
thousand unique visitors every day. This highly appreciated service
is now to be shut down, according to the latest finance bill.

The reason for this is - according to the bill - that there is today
"a large amount of entrepreneurs who provide Internet based search
engines for the public. This means that a government funded endeavor
in this area no longer can be motivated."

This, however, is not true. There is no search engine for
specifically Swedish cultural matters on the web. And Culturenet
Sweden is much more than a search engine. Culturenet Sweden provides
highly refined information ABOUT but foremost BY cultural Sweden
itself, regardless of which ministry a certain item belongs to,
regardless of if it is public or private, commercial or
non-commercial.

Note that Culturenet Sweden is dealing with Swedish cultural life in
its entirety. No authority, agency or function other than Culturenet
Sweden has this unique scope of both public and private efforts
within culture, commercial or non-commercial, institutional or
individual.

Shutting down Culturenet Sweden is probably something the government
will regret sooner or later, since so many projects launched today
are supposed to work along the same lines as Culturenet Sweden, i.e.
through joint efforts and cooperation on several levels in society.

Shutting down Culturenet Sweden would be an enormous waste of
resources that have been collected and organized during the last nine
years.


DON'T SHUT DOWN CULTURENET SWEDEN!

INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FINANCING CULTURENET SWEDEN!

INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING CULTURENET SWEDEN TO ANOTHER
HOST AUTHORITY!

while you're lettter writing,
there's a further acerbic critique
of Derrida on the 1st Arts & Leisure
page of today's NYTIMES...by the
cultural critic, Edward Rothstein...

"we do not know in fact

for those of us old 'nuf
'to have lived thru..existentialsim..

structuralism and post post

the reaction against derrida is
not anti-intellectual....it is anti
academic...a very very different
thing...the prof class and its
acolytes...a class that
couldn't figure out someone

Hi there

I am currently reading Nicholson Baker's "Vox", and I am a bit confused by a
word, "fran", that the male protagonist uses to name breasts... I can't find
any accurate definition anywhere? In french it has been translated by
"pine-apple", which sounds quite ridiculous to me...

Thanks,

Cyrill.

I was admonished last year in Philly by a transit cop for taking a photo of
my daughter by the El there... and since I had my (then 5 year old) with me,
I didn't press the issue... we used to collect photos of her by trains which
she loves so much...

The Library of Congress has completed a major expansion of the "Meeting of=
=20
Frontiers" Web site http://frontiers.loc.gov, the seventh since the site=20
was first launched in December 1999.

"Meeting of Frontiers" is a bilingual, English-Russian collaborative=20
project that chronicles the parallel experiences of the United States and=
=20
Russia in exploring, developing and settling their frontiers, and the=20
meeting of those frontiers in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. It features=
=20
rare books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, sheet music and other materials=
=20
from libraries in the United States and Russia, and is widely used in=20
schools and libraries throughout the United States and Russia.

The latest expansion includes 24 collections from 14 different libraries=20
and archives in Irkutsk, Kemerovo, Krasnoiarsk, Novosibirsk, Tomsk, and=20
other Siberian cities, as well as additional collections from the National=
=20
Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg, the Russian State Library in Moscow,=
=20
and the Library of Congress. Digitization of materials in Siberia was=20
undertaken by a mobile scanning team based in Novosibirsk that worked in=20
cooperation with the Library of Congress to identify rare materials of=20
special interest to American and Russian scholars, teachers, and students.

Among the items included in the latest expansion are photographs of the=20
indigenous peoples of eastern Siberia taken by scientific expeditions to=20
remote regions of Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th=20
centuries;  photographs depicting the life of the Russian =E9migr=E9 commun=
ity=20
in Harbin, China in the 1920s -1940s; albums and photograph collections=20
relating to icebreaking on Lake Baikal and to fire-fighting in Irkutsk;=20
manuscripts and photographs that document the persecution of Russian Old=20
Believer religious communities under the communist authorities; sketches,=
=20
drawings, and watercolors of the Siberian landscape by several local=20
artists; and documents and photographs relating to the Cheliuskin, a Soviet=
=20
scientific research vessel that sank in February 1934 while attempting to=
=20
sail the Northern Sea route from Murmansk to Vladivostok.

With the most recent additions, the "Meeting of Frontiers"  Web site=20
includes more than 580,000 digital images relating to the history of=20
Siberia, Alaska, and the American West.

"Meeting of Frontiers" is funded by Congressional appropriations in the=20
Library's FY 1999 and FY 2004 budgets. Additional support for development=
=20
of the project in Russia has been provided by the Open Society Institute of=
=20
Russia.

This online presentation joins other collections from around the world=20
available through the Global Gateway Web site. These collections can be=20
seen at http://www.loc.gov/international. In the "Collaborative Digital=20
Libraries" section are materials from Brazil, the Netherlands, Russia and=
=20
Spain. The "Digital Collections" section provides links to thematic=20
presentations, including "Puerto Rico at the Dawn of the Modern Age," "The=
=20
Spanish-American War in Motion Pictures" and the extraordinary=20
"Prokudin-Gorskii Collection" of photographs of Russia taken just before=20
the revolution.

this is interesting. What an American reader notices as a stylistic
convention an international reader picks up as a reinscription of regional
bias.

For me this capitalization loads the term with semantic cargo that aligns
term with Eastern Intellectual or conversely Big Business. Hasn't the
East Coast always occupied a place of distrust within America?

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Well, Harry, BBC Radio 4 last week had a 45 minute discussion programme devoted entirely to Sartre (well, almost entirely, Camus
elbowed his way in at one point) and in my mind that doesn't quite qualify for the status of being 'forgotten'. I can't and won't
comment on any US internal politics, academic or otherwise, involved in the reception of Derrida on yr shores, it's hard enough to
figure out what goes on in this 'tight little island' let alone anywhere else.

drn's point, viz., that reaction against derrida is
anti-academic/professional rather than anti-intellectual, has some
merit...

but then we'd have to ask whether this variant of
anti-professionalism is warranted... if we need a good physician, we
find one (IF we can afford one, that is)---we rarely question the
professional value of competent physicians when we go under the
knife... ditto for a good lawyer, etc...

naturally, to really get at this would take us into a discussion of
the roots of (u.s.) intellectual labor, as so much of same---not all
of course, but so much of same---has, over the past three or four
decades, been squeezed by economic and cultural forces into
university confines... i don't believe one can speak any longer of a
thriving intellectual community (again, in the u.s.) that operates
entirely outside of the university sphere (not least b/c so many of
us now hold college degrees)... i'd like to be proved wrong about
this, but i think it unlikely... i do think---and i have read the
counterarguments, yes, but---i do think intellectual labor in the
u.s. is generally given short-shrift by the u.s. public... how and
why that anti-intellectualism has been transposed so disparagingly
onto an entire profession---despite the lip service so often paid to
teaching (which doesn't generally mean postsecondary teaching, of
course)---is probably beyond the confines of a listserv discussion,
esp. one that so often reveals itself to be so contentious over
trifling matters...

there is a difference in any case between understanding the reaction
to derrida in such terms and endorsing it in such terms... and for
the record, i knew it wouldn't be long before sartre was trucked out
in preemptive, 'been there done that' terms (i should have placed
bets)... which i don't accept for an instant, as any close reading of
any of derrida's texts from the 60s will verify (and sartre is still
present in so many discussions, for that matter)... also, for the
record, i've only been able myself to get through "differance,"
"white mythology," "structure sign and play," and parts of ~the ear
of the other~ and ~disseminations~ with anything approaching readerly
consistency... but then again, i can't read past the first few pages
of minkowski's "space and time" and yet i seemed to do ok in college
physics and as an engineer for seven years, so i suppose most of us
work with a more applied notion of such ideas in any case...

all of which is perhaps to say, i don't claim myself to be a theorist...

again, i would like someone to explain to me how they fancy the past
40 years of work in literary criticism specifically w/o the
poststructuralists (etc.)... we can call this an exercise in
counterfactual history, if you like... either that, or explain to me
why we ought not to pay any heed to the litcritters and theorists,
which latter attitude has clearly fueled the animus to derrida et al.
in creative writing circles, of this much i'm certain...

best,

joe

of work on CD:

studio quality readings by:

Anselm Berrigan, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Rodrigo Toscano, Rod Smith, =
Deborah Richards, Carol Mirakove, Kristen Prevallet etc. etc. but he's not =
getting any feedback from his audience. The one year anniversary of Narrow =
House took place at the Bowery Poetry club with a massive turnout; but no o=
ne bought recordings! He's not even, after one year, getting any reception =
from anybody.

What is he doing wrong? Is he doing something wrong? Is there an audience f=
or this media?

Please, write me.

During the most recent round of IMF/peace vigil protester presence here in
DC, there were po-pos all over the place. I started taking pictures of
them and their vehicles for my 2-year-old nephew, and was never stopped.
Oddly, the only place I *was* stopped from taking pictures was at the
World Bank... and it wasn't even identifiable as such. I was merely taking
pictures of mopeds parked outside it, not even with license tags visible.
Go figure.

In fact, as I neared the Farragut West metro to go home, I found a group
of three officers just hanging out together. I told them that my
2-year-old nephew was obsessed with all things polizei, and could I please
take their picture? They agreed readily. In fact, in a truly wonderful
moment, the bike cop made rabbit ears behind the middle guy's head.

I am glad I was doing this with a disposacam, unecological as they are;
had it been confiscated, I would have been out only six bucks.

Derrida studied Sartre in his youth at the Lycee in Algeria --

I studied Sartre with Peter Caws here in the USA --

While it may be the case that neither Sartre nor existentialism appears
with much frequency in contemporary literature courses, he is hardly
forgotten on these shores --

a quick google of Sartre turns up considerable recent traffic -- even the
Sartre Cookbook!

Subject:      Brakhage/Acker connection?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

hello list,

I'm trying to figure out if Kathy Acker helped Stan Brakhage
with his first book "Metaphors on Vision."

Before you laugh, let me explain.  I know the internet is a
lousy place for authoritative information, but in some obituary
(since the list is talking about obits these days) it mentioned
that her original surname was Alexander.  If that's not
true then the rest of this is bunk.

So in the acknowledgements page of the Second Edition of
Metphors on Vision Brakhage says among other things:

"I am grateful to Kathy Alexander, David Hellman, George Landow,
Charles Westin IV and the University of Colorado for help
preparing this manuscript."

If this text was published with the original edition in 1963
that would still have been Acker's name (see above caveat).  I
read in an interview with her (not sure if it was the Lotringer
one in the Semiotext book) where she said that the experimental
film scene people (meaning Jonas Mekas, P. Adams Sitney,
Brakhage, et al) "adopted me as their mascot" or words to that
effect.  I think she'd have been about 16 at the time and i can
easily imagine her volunteering to help with the book if she was
around that scene at all in NY.

Does anyone have any opinions or better, FACTS regarding this
connection?  I'n not interested in making so much hay out of it
as just filling in my sense of the communities and crossovers.

  Thanks,

  konrad steiner

Indian writer to donate Sydney Peace Prize to
Aborigines
October 12, 2004 - 8:35PM


Controversial Indian author Arundhati Roy has accused
Australia of genocide and reportedly plans to donate
her $50,000 Sydney Peace Prize to Aboriginal political
activists.

The 1997 Booker Prize winner for her novel The God of
Small Things is due to accept the award in Sydney on
November 4.

In an interview to be published in Wednesday's edition
of The Bulletin magazine, Ms Roy compares Aborigines
to India's Untouchables, or Dalits as they're now
known.

"It (untouchability) is one of the most cruel forms of
discrimination, but one thing that didn't happen to
them was the attempt to genocidally wipe them out,
which happened in Australia," she told The Bulletin.

"It's funny, I've spent so much time in South Africa
recently, and the white South Africans have a
fascination for Australia.

"So, I was talking to some black friends and they
laughed and said, 'Yeah, it's because they think the
Australians got it right. They just killed the blacks.
The South Africans let us survive'."

Ms Roy said she wanted the prize money to go to
Aboriginal political activists to further their work.


"I don't want to give the money to Aboriginal
communities as some act of charity," she said.

"I want to give it to people who are involved with
political work there ... there's no complicated
reason, it's just a straightforward political fight
for survival and for rights."

Mr Roy has previously branded US President George W
Bush as a "terrorist" and described Australia's
military presence in Iraq as "inexcusable."

First awarded in 1998, The Sydney Peace Prize is no
stranger to controversy.

Last year's award to Palestinian activist Dr Hanan
Ashrawi unleashed a torrent of anger from Jewish
groups, with prize sponsors lobbied to withdraw and
the then Sydney Lord Mayor Lucy Turnball snubbing the
event.

Ms Roy has been awarded this year's prize for her
advocacy in demanding justice for the poor and people
displaced by dam projects, as well as her opposition
to nuclear weapons.

Hi---

I've been trying to figure this out for years.
Part of it is I think a distrust of "performance"
among the "sophisticated" set these days
(to which I can attest; often I am called a good performer of my work,
and that is quite often a "left-handed" compliment, as if you're
not being "serious" enough).
But that can't be the only reason---
for as you say there was a "massive turnout" at the event
but no one bought the CD.
This also rings true in my experience,
both as a poet and musician.
Perhaps it's economic; people spend the money
to see the show and just don't have much left
to listen to a CD in the privacy of their room
(does it lose something in the 'translation'?).
I guess I thought when I put the CD of my band playing rock songs together,
it would do better than tapes of my poetry readings.
But so far it hasn't. So, here, I think the issue is distribution, etc.
I mean, we gotta reach out to a different (non-poetry) audience,
but that probably takes more money for publicity than your friend,
or I, or whoever, had....
I keep thinking that the days in which a young Richard Hell,
Patti Smith, Jim Carroll, Leonard Cohen, etc. etc.,
could find ways to do this
are not just iced in history.
I think Edwin Torres' album on KillRockStars did okay
(but KillRockStars had the publicity and distribution)
at least relatively speaking, but maybe you should ask him about that.

I'd definitely like to join forces with you
to help change this state of affairs....
maybe we could brainstorm or something

Chris

Subject: [Weblogsky] Revised Derrida Post

Alan Sondheim posted a comment re. the Derrida review in the NYT and
sent me a couple of emails, including a link to a tribute at Le
Monde. I've updated the post:

That difficult man, Jacques Derrida, has died. Derrida practiced
direct transmission of the zen of decontstruction. Or perhaps not.
[Link to NY Times obituary]

Update: Alan Sondheim notes that the New York Times is not a fair or
comprehensive assessment of Derrida, let alone a fitting obituary.
Here's a link to a pdf of a ten-page tribute to Derrida in Le Monde
(in French).

The NYT obituary is disturbing; the death of one of the world's
leading thinkers is hardly the time for a hack critique and attack.
There are good obits, particularly in french, available online.

Derrida has meant an enormous amount to some of us, a way of
rethinking reason itself, a problematizing of theory, an odd form of
symbolic materialism. My own work would be vastly different without
him.

Derrida has always struck me as a continuation of exegesis,
hermeneutics; many of us have silently responded to the rabbinical
within him. And many of us have responded as well to his compassion
for complexity, facing the difficulty of the world, acting within
that difficulty, without diminishment.

would be a matter of only a few generations to reach the several billion
necessary for extinguishing. but in fact every death creates yet another
lost potential; the pool is lost.

this is the paradox: the inability of the species to extinguish itself by
transitive chains, without the aid of war, terrorism, and other forms of
slaughter.

the difficulty with these? transpeciation. do we really want to
indiscriminately take other life-forms with us? the beauty of the chain is
that it results in a minimum of damage at each level.

disease carries on this work for us. it is disease that has the capability
for exponential expansion. but disease is indiscriminate, doesn't work
quickly enough, and runs up against good intentions. the very first thing
is to eliminate good intentions.

good intentions are bad intentions. to save one of us might eliminate an
entire species.

it returns to the reversal and its inability. genidentity plays a role; to
act from the dead upon the living involves a problematic ontological
shift. despite humanity's constant efforts, there is no indication of
this, not to mention its efficacy.

no, we are left with our debris, garbage-animals slaughtering without
discrimination, unable to kill off our own for the good of the polis.
would that death were action, that death spread like the environmental
savior it may well be. germ warfare, yes, but highly targeted. there is no
other answer; this is stopgap at best.

I heard Jerome Rothenberg read from these translations of Picasso at the
first of the Holdengraber readings at LACMA several years ago, and they
are really, really wonderful.

Reviews of Two Works: Lanny Quarles / Alan Sondheim


Lanny Quarles (solipsis) has created/written/produced/configured Nihon
Zettels; he was kind enough to send me a copy to read. The review is my
own idea.

I think for anyone interested in the literature of this (not _that_)
century, this book is essential. I'm fascinated by the palimpsest or
palimcestual organization / organicism of the whole - but I'm also
fascinated on its deep reading of medieval and pre-medieval Japan and
gaijin phenomenology - both in relation to the eternal. For it's eternity,
I think, that's at stake here. There are various languages within it as
well as languagings, and what I consider to be stele-texts, matched in
format by the book - texts which begin and end and open up kabbalah-worlds
and words in the midst of others.

There are positionings of male and female, demiurge and Noh, classifica-
tions and lists, broken syntactics, shattered and reassembled mythologies.
The text is astute, almost schizzed at times, but its open worlds are the
poetics of infinity; Bachelard would have loved it.

I worry constantly that works of this quality - and I'd include other work
here - Joel Weishaus' or mez' absolutely brilliant web/write\rite/lit for
example - will be lost, ignored, bypassed in terms of critical or even
canonic acceptance. The world - and the world of distribution - are both
becoming increasingly porous - it's easier than ever to find these works
and absorb them, offline and online, self-published and universally
published.

Get this book!

The Blurb:

Titled after Arno Schmidt's magnum opus _Zettels Traum_ (Notes Dream),
Lanny Quarles' Nihon Zettels Traum is a samizdat email-list series carried
out on Wryting-L transfered to paper. Including all and some repeats of
the original series of emails written after the author had returned from
Japan. The author sought to re-immerse himself in the wonder and
strangeness of his first visit to japan via the internet. Interspersed
with bits of sampled literatures both of web and non-web origin, the
author freely improvised and remixed to create a perplexing and
"informatic free jazz" interpretation of his journey to and back from the
land of Nihon.

Price $25.00 for color copy cover and velo binding
and $12.00 for a simple paper cover with hand drawn noiseglyph and signature

Sampler

I've been putting my work on a DVD+ sampler. Please note this is DVD+ -
which plays on almost all computers, but probably not on a standard DVD
player. The work as usual is within a directory; click on a piece to view
it. Because of the format, I've been able to include a large number of
full-frame videowork. Much of the material is related to choreography,
codework, thinking through body/language/sexuality/'the political/etc.

You can also buy this for $25; apologies for the cost, but a lot of
equipment went into the production/technology of the disk.

THE SWING is the prelude project to ACTS-OF-ART, an international arts
foundation in the making that will focus the creativity and energy of
artists worldwide on questions of political urgency.

Roughly a hundred artists=8Blargely poets, visual artists, and
playwrights=8Bparticipating in THE SWING are engaged in projects in the publi=
c
sphere that raise consciousness about the 2004 election campaign.  Examples
of projects include radio poetry, graphic design for posters and newspapers=
,
traveling theater, voter registration events, driving-to-the-polls, and
facts inscribed on free gifts, mailing labels, and Chinese fortunes.

Artists participating in =B3The Swing=B2 invite citizens into the process of
voting=8Bi.e., voting as process, not just outcome.  The projects are largely
centered in swing states, where there is the greatest uncertainty about not
only who to vote for, but also presumably about what it means.  Staged
events, images, sensory experiences, and factual statements, are meant to
provoke at once visceral and thoughtful reactions that will help individual=
s
make meaning out of the election process.  The projects do not focus on
endorsing a particular candidate.  They are meant to raise consciousness
not only for the =B3audience=B2 these projects reach, but also for the
individual artists involved.  In many cases, the participants are graduate
students in arts degree programs, as led by their older colleagues and
teachers.  All of the artists involved work largely at the margins of the
corporate and political powers-that-be.

Questions =B3The Swing=B2 poses: What is this political world we find ourselves
in?  How can we help ourselves, and others, make meaning out of it? What ar=
e
the facts before us?  How can we make them known, to ourselves, to others,
in such a way that we can act reflectively and humanly?   Is it possible to
look at hard facts in a way that is empowering, and not debilitating, to
individuals?   When artists take to making meaning in the streets and publi=
c
forums, can their marginal status actually be a powerful thing?  Given that
the participants are themselves at the margins of power, can they help the
huge numbers of people also at the margins  (ethnic voting populations, the
disenfranchised, the as-yet-unregistered voters)  themselves (if they could
realize it, and act) form a majority.
 =20

Example of projects underway:

1)  Short radio pieces made by  a poet and playwright,
    mixed by a sound artist,  that set a list of facts about
    the current administration to music.  To be aired
    in a number of swing states.

2)  Two voter registration weekends of barbeques
    and bar-hops with fact campaign t-shirts, pens,
    bi-lingual art-designed fact booklets, and
    voter registration forms and awards for filling
    them out in Portland, Oregon and Seattle,
    Washington in the African American and Latino
    communities.=20

3)  A package complete with rubber stamps, ink pads,
    and fact campaign labels, along with suggestions of
    where and what to stamp, to be sent to 100 addresses.
    Recipients are encouraged to  photocopy the label
    sheets (30 labels to a sheet), and distribute them
    to other people.
     =20
4)  A voter driving campaign in Florida on election day,
    in which a number of two-person teams will artfully
    pick up one after another person, and drive them to
    and from the voting booths.

5)  Two color posters designed for The Swing that target
    African American communities to be printed in batches
    of up to 50,000 that will be distributed and disseminated
    around Michigan and Ohio, as well as mailed to spots
    around the country.

6)  A 7-person theater group that will be touring malls,
    parking lots, and other public areas for one week in
    Minnesota  and potentially North Carolina. A video artist
    is part of the group and will be documenting the experience.

7)  An environmental campaign that will be distributing
    free gifts with fact labels and handwritten VOTE on them
    at target lakes and parks, as well as car washes and
    corporations in Michigan.
=20
8)  A newspaper advertisement with numbers of those slain
     in Iraq and the word.  Vote.

9)  A van of poets driving from their program in upstate New
     York to Cleveland to register voters.

Oh, you ask so much here!
1. What is he doing wrong?  (I'll share a few words of general ideas in =
a little while).
2. Is he doing something wrong?=20
3. Is there an audience for this media?=20

Let's take the Q's in reverse order.=20

3. There's a market for anything!  I can show you a catalog from which =
one can purchase only short pieces of old, rusted barbed wire, and =
another catalog from which one may acquire used toilet seats from =
different decades or other countries.  And these products sell; worse =
(or better, depending upon you POV) they have a decidedly active market, =
as hard as that may be to believe.=20

The success in the marketing usually has little or nothing to do with =
the product or service one is attempting to sell.   Rather they have to =
do with:
a. positioning the product right in its market (meaning you have to ID =
that market and price it correctly).
b. advertising the product to the appropriate audience (perhaps the most =
difficult of the three things because it means you have to describe the =
folks you are targeting without ever having seen, or met or eaten lunch =
with one of the targets).=20
c. packaging...a Chicago ad chap once said, "...and if I put cow chips =
in the right package I can sell them to the mothers of America as =
essential yard and garden enrichment pills, and I'll price them at 100 =
times higher per Lb than fertilizer sells for in the open market..."  =
You needn't look too far beyond the Wall-Mart stores to find bags of =
various cow manure products to see that he was right.=20

2. Yep, he's doing lots wrong.  He thinks he's selling his product to =
himself...funny, that just ain't the case.

1. See three above, and this: I visited the site:  =
http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/thepixelplus/nhindex.html<http://www.ange=
lfire.com/poetry/thepixelplus/nhindex.html> here are my thoughts, take =
them or not, as you wish.=20

The graphics on the site amount to what I would call visual pollution.  =
The montage and the collage are clever tools if cleverly used to =
advantage in marketing.  In the case of this particular site, the =
visuals lack both appeal to a general audience and relevance to any =
target audience I could muster up in my mind.=20

Sorry if all this seems decidedly negative, but, I remind you, you did =
ask.
alex=20
P.S. I get $3500 a day for marketing consulting fees (plus expenses), =
and no, I'm not interested in taking on clients in the arts who can't =
afford to pay the rate.  But I will offer to continue to back channel =
answers to specific questions. =20

  This letter concerns audio poetry, i.e., aural, i.e...

  My buddy Justin Sirois of Narrow House Recordings has put out a great =
deal of work on CD:

  studio quality readings by:

  Anselm Berrigan, Laura Elrick, Heather Fuller, Rodrigo Toscano, Rod =
Smith, Deborah Richards, Carol Mirakove, Kristen Prevallet etc. etc. but =
he's not getting any feedback from his audience. The one year =
anniversary of Narrow House took place at the Bowery Poetry club with a =
massive turnout; but no one bought recordings! He's not even, after one =
year, getting any reception from anybody.

  What is he doing wrong? Is he doing something wrong? Is there an =
audience for this media?

  Please, write me.

audio poetry well i wouldn't  do w/out my spoken word lps and tapes and
cds  about 200 everyone from yeats joyce to kerouac  and edwin torres
too

they just reissued a great  kenneth patchen /w jazz cd

mingus and langston  hughes lots of history  "written" on vinyl

i have a few cds out myself  w/musicians  the first one sold fairly well
but i never saw a royalty  still have a few for sale if anyone wants one
w/great musicians  all ny based  some really well known  another w/a
drummer also for sale  well enough shameless self promotion

they are a very specialized market  because mine are w/ mostly jazz
musicians  and i am known in that world  my first damn cd was not even
put in the spoken word/poetry section it always ended up whether in tower
or some small town store in the jazz or miscellaneous  section

anyway eileen myles and i once talked about this full house stuff how
sometimes you do a good gig and they buy like crazy other times  they
love  you  but hey they just don't seem to love you enough to take you
home this goes for books as well as cds  i've been at great music shows
where they buy cds like crazy after a gig and many actually most if they
aren't rock gigs especially where they buy none   case in point  ken
vandermark sells like crazy
after gigs as do a few other avante musicians i know  but most don't

when i do the concession table at a music fest i'm involved in because i
sit there i selll my goods pretty well but i can do a supreme gig like i
did at housingworks end of august full house 50 people  great response
FREE gig  no admission  i sold one book or cd  i forget
each musician there were 2 sold one each

so the gig can be free and packed it won't matter tho the theory of
paying for show  and then not buying  does hold water  what can we do???
well  it's up to the individual artist to hawk their wares if the company
 publisher etc  doesn't   i sold more cds and books on my own  because
all the turkeys that published me even if nice guys  or big boys like my
first cd which got great and many reviews  don't do any promotion

and in the non performance poetry world  we tend to buy the book before
the cd

one way to do this better is to combine both formats  something
ratapallax does cheaply and successfully  and every now and again we find
in books

but selling any  good non mainstreamm "product" is always tough and
always will be

tired  lights out  zombies tomorrow   hope this heps

hey chris tell your friend  i want to make a cd on his label

is there an audience  yes  books on tape  caedmon catalogue in print for
50 yrs
good ole dylan thomas  i heard him i think before i read him  i think

is there an audience for poetry??? is there an audioaudience//? is there
an audience ???

Caribbean-Canadian In Us Now
 >>Call for Papers
 >>A Special Issue of The Journal of West Indian Literature

 >>The Journal of West Indian Literature is planning a special issue on
 >>Caribbean-Canadian literary production.  Guest editors Michael Bucknor
 >>(University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica) and Daniel Coleman
 >>(McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario) invite papers from a wide
 >>variety of regions, methods, and perspectives on the general topic of
 >>literary production between the Caribbean and Canada.  In the
 >>immigration-oriented era of the 1970s, an early anthology of Black
 >>writing in Canada was published under the title, "Canada In Us Now."
 >>The title emphasized not only the presence of Caribbean writers of
 >>various descent in Canada, but also the permeation of Canadianness into
 >>the writings of Caribbean-born people.  By the 1980s, Guyanese-Canadian
 >>Cyril Dabydeen was bearing witness in his anthology, A Shapely Fire, to
 >>the intercultural exchanges taking place between Canada and the
 >>Caribbean.  Since then, the increasing movement back and forth between
 >>the Caribbean islands and Canada, as well as with other places such as
 >>the Unites States and Europe since the 1970s and 1980s, has meant that
 >>the confluence of Caribbean and Canadian writings has disseminated
 >>widely.  The Caribbean-Canadian is, indeed, in many of "us" now,
 >>whoever and wherever "we" are located--in the islands, in Canada,
 >>between these places and the Unites States, Europe, or Central and
 >>South America.
 >>
 >>The literary production of Caribbean-Canadian is "in" us in many and
 >>diverse ways: in the fictional diasporic worlds created by renowned
 >>novelists such as Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke, Neil Bissoondath, John
 >>Hearne, or Sam Selvon; in the creolized genres of dub poetry and yard
 >>theatre; in theoretical meditations on diasporic experience, carnival
 >>body awareness, and linguistic migration (Dionne Brand, Olive Senior,
 >>Marlene NourbeSe Philip, and Ted Chamberlain); in musical forms such as
 >>hip hop, reggae, dance hall, and steel pan that influence the poetic
 >>rhythms of Lillian Allen, Klyde Broox, or Clifton Joseph; in the
 >>inter-ethnic, cross-racial, trans-national positionings that combine
 >>and confront the histories of French, British, and Spanish colonialism,
 >>British-Canadian marine commerce in the West Indies, slavery,
 >>indenture, and commercial or labour migration.  Caribbean-Canadian
 >>literary production rises out of the vibrancy and violation of this
 >>complex cultural and political inheritance, and it remains politically
 >>and aesthetically dynamic and experimental on all fronts.

 >>The editors invite papers of 20 - 25 double-spaced typed pages in

Joe: It's no secret that anti-intellectualism is as American as apple pie
and has been for a very long time. The professoriate as such has been until
fairly recently largely unnoticed, but when it was (see, for instance,
Howard Hawks' 1941 comedy Ball of Fire) it was usually depicted as a bunch
of harmless eccentrics. Probably because colleges and universities played a
very small role inn American life--very few went to college, and the first
grad school as we kow it, Johns Hopkins, wasn't founded until 1876, on the
model of German universities.

The present hostility towards academia flowered during the Viet Nam era,
when campus politics became a convenient excuse for cutting the funding for
higher education. But the vulnerability wasn't only because of public
political stances or campus rebellion. It seems to me that there were two
more systemic reasons. First, a college degree had become a class marker of
a different sort: whereas before WWII relatively small numbers attended
college, the elite at private colleges, others at state universities (I
realize that this is a large generalization--NY, for instance, was as
always an exception), they had become an absolute criterion for most middle
class jobs, tho few of thjose jobs had anything to do with what was learned
at school. Large numbers who previously would have entered the middle class
job market through apprenticeship or trade school found themselves forced
to endure a course of study they were ill prepared for and often
uninterested in. The agents of their oppression were the professors.

Second, increasingly the proferssoriate lived in a shadow country with
little contact with the concerns of the local population from which their
students were drawn. The professoriate migrates for jobs, and the
university community in, say, San Diego, has more concerned contact withe
the university community in Lawrence Kansas thjan with the rest of Sasn
Diego. Even when they speak out on locxal issues they speak as strangers.

Of course the Viet Nam era draft exclusions for college kids reinforced the
sense of academia as a worlds apart, but the systemic issues would have
sooner or later tyaken theirr toll.

Century Japanese poets: Takashi Hiraide, Ryoko
Sekiguchi, Chika Sagawa, Masato Inagawa, Ayane Kawata,
and Hirata Toshiko.

Canyon Press. He is a long time resident of the Bay
Area, currently living on the peninsula where he works
as a technical translator. His most recent book of
poems is The Condition of Music on Sink Press.

A sampling of poetry trans. by Nakayasu:

Sagawa:

Like a cloud
Insects pierce green through the orchard
crawl the undersides of leaves
ceaselessly multiplying.
Mucous expelled from nostrils
seem like blue mist falling.
At times, they
without a sound flutter and vanish into the sky.
The ladies, always with irritation in their eyes
gather the unripe fruit.
Countless scars are attached to the sky.
Hanging like elbows.
And then I see,
the orchard cleaving from the center.
A bare patch emerges there, burning like a cloud.

Hiraide:
18.
May the danger which has grown hairs always be holding
your hand. May the unjust prayers and select worries
keep rocking my lungs. And then without the days going
by, or the ability ever to confirm the sound of love,
may the ashes of the bones of stories repeatedly
burned cook our deeds inside the furnace of the truth
of things destroyed.
54.
Midway down the deep darkness of the trash bin, the
kid plum finally caught on. Á°h, I am about to rot
away, without ever having leapt, never having known
anything tough and shiny. And then, through the wet
wrappers and bread crumbs, he slid down two
body-lengths. Cheering is heard from afar.

Kawata:
3.
Flinging inwards
and further in
the innocent window
Screams are forced to run radiantly and full speed


From Seal
by Inagawa Masato
(Tr. Eric Selland)

People continuously scatter
Here and there
Words also scatter
Here and there

Not withstanding a period of discord
The position of death darkening to green
Shifts to a position of minute solitude
Limitlessly blurring the position of the work
Then deriding both failure and hope
He pursues a frenzied, round life
Their number left the same
Cut off from the original intent
Each thing supported made over again
And steadily on into something too deficient
He loses the words before his very eyes
To an unsaid punishment
Repeatedly he discards the same name and commentary
Even to this long period of discord of the metaphor of
the work
He answers only with his own name and identity

from "Arc Tangent":

Outside the sentence
Rain is falling
As if a porous film
Set between waking and sleep.

The parched mouth and
Uneasiness of night remain.
It dissolves. The sickness does not dissolve.

Always the expected visit
The order to awaken
And selection

The water mark
Mirror in my sleep
Measuring the presence of light.

Hope to see you there,

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

"The freedom to say everything is a very powerful political weapon, but
one which might immediately let itself be neutralized as a fiction. This
revolutionary power can become very conservative. The writer can just as
well be held to be irresponsible. He can, I'd even say that he must
sometimes demand a certain irresponsibility, at least as regards
ideological powers, of a Zhdanovian type for example, which try to call
him back to extremely determinate responsibilities before
socio-political or ideological bodies. This duty of irresponsibility, of
refusing to reply for one's thought or writing to constituted powers, is
perhaps the highest form of responsibility. To whom, to what?

...

The experience, the passion of language and writing (I'm speaking here
just as much of body, desire, ordeal), can cut across discourses which
are thematically 'reactionary' or 'conservative' and confer upon them a
power of provocation, transgression or destabilization greater than that
of so-called 'revolutionary' texts (whether of the right or the left)
which advance peacefully in neo-academic or neoclassical forms. Here too
I'm thinking of a large number of works of this century whose political
message and themes would be legitimately situated 'on the right' and
whose work of writing and thought can no longer be so easily classified,
either in itself or in its effects.

...

At the moment we are in a slightly 'crude' and heavy-handed phase of the
question. In polemical argument, there is too much confidence in the
assumed sexual identities of the signatories, in the very concept of
sexual identity, things are dealt with too generally, as if a text were
this or that, in a homogeneous way, for this or that, without taking
account of what it is in the status or the very structure of a literary
work--I would rather say in the paradoxes of its economy--which ought to
discourage these simplistic notions."

If anything could be consider 'truth' it would have no connection with
the rest for indeed we know that "'truth needs no sign" (this is the
very condition of 'truth') that it is independent and does not lack
anything to complete itself -- it is true (sapere aude!).

Derrida was not at work to uncover the truth, but solely to uncover the
meaning.



This is why we are right when we point to deconstruction and say it is
contradictory and without so-called 'sense' or even 'reason'... because
the chief property of deconstruction is disavowal of the imposed order
-- which is to say it is a potential to openness:

Any text is merely a 'sign' (something imagined), and NOT the actual
thing signified (the text/thing itself).



The point Derrida is trying to get at with the idea and practice of
deconstruction is the fulfillment of revelation -- namely to remove the
'construction' aspect of understanding (something imagined) and open
oneself up the underlying possibilities -- to bring things
down-to-the-foundation as it were (think 9/11) and to 'level with it'
and see clearly without self-imposed constructions.

Derrida is only willing to use material which is actually available, not
the fantasy of a construct. Now certain people will say that this is
crazy and that many things are not possible (ah!) but Derrida's
deconstruction proves this to be untrue. He removes the fallacy of
self-satisfied achievement -- the self-made man is thrown back to
openness.



From the beginning is the surest way of interpreting anything (ie.
through the thing itself).


So we must remember, as Derrida did, that every text is polluted by the
prejudges of its age -- what the text desired, at that time, to signify
or represent by symbols. From this we must understand that what is
signified can only be equated solely by means of examination of the
signification itself (which is to say meaning is inferred in relation to
context, and context is diverse).


Therefore we must say that one should not dare to derive anything from
anything which is not that thing itself. Derrida was consumed -only-
with the preservation of meaning.


The aim of deconstruction is to avoid attempting to know 'in part' what
is in essence 'whole' ("il n' y a pas de hors-texte"). This is a way to
see things from a very wide angle which does not include any boundaries,
no 'pre' or 'post' or 'post-post' anything!

Subject has no authority. Things are what they are (without quality):

        It was evening all afternoon.
        It was snowing
        And it was /going/ to snow.

The sound of any speech/writing etc. is full of the same wind that is
blowing the same bare place.

the one and itself

I Thought It Was Harry

Excuse me. I thought for a moment you were someone I know.
It happens to me. One time at *The Circle in the Square*
when it *was* still in the Square, I turned my head
when the lights went up and saw me there with a girl
and another couple. Out in the lobby, I looked
right at him and he looked away. I was no one he knew.
Well, it takes two, as they say, and I don't know what
it would prove anyway. Do we know who we are,
do you think? Kids seem to know. One time I asked
a little girl. She said she'd been sick. She said
she'd looked different and felt different. I said,
"Maybe it wasn't you. How do you know?"
"Oh, I was me," she said, "I know I was."

That part doesn't bother me anymore
or not the way it did. I'm nobody else
and nobody anyway. It's all the rest
I don't know. I don't know anything.
It hit me. I thought it was Harry when I saw you
and thought, "I'll ask Harry." I don't suppose
he knows, though. It's not that I get confused.
I don't mean that. If someone appeared and said,
"Ask me some questions," I wouldn't know where to start.
I don't have questions even. It's the way I fade
as though I were someone's snapshot left in the light.
And the background fades the way it might if we woke
in the wrong twilight and things got dim and grey
while we waited for them to sharpen. Less and less
is real. No fixed point. Questions fix
a point, as answers do. Things move again
and the only place to move is away. It was wrong:
questions and answers are what to be without
and all we learn is how sound our ignorance is.
That's what I wanted to talk to Harry about.
You looked like him. Thank you anyway.

mark, i take your points about ant-intellectualism... i wanted simply
to register that there are dissenting views re the tenor (e.g.) of
hofstadter's work (which i nonetheless think is on the money)...

re hostility to the academy through the conduit of the 60s:  yes, and
of course the campus politics of those times (which others on this
list, incl. you mark, can speak directly to, where i cannot) were not
nearly as clearcut as we're often led to believe... there's a
two-page spread in this past sunday's nytbr (of all places) by
franklin foer that does a nice job of showing how e.g. vietnam
splintered certain conservative tendencies (with the isolationists
joining the new left, and often switching ranks again with the
arrival of the paleocons)...

fundamentally, too, there are masculinist assumptions at work here re
the cultural status of intellectual work... which is to say, the
history of feminism has to do with how intellectual politics have
played themselves out on campus and in the culture at large... if
e.g. campus eggheads (like me) are to be feminized as a result of the
work that they do, then one way to regain cultural authority might be
to position oneself as an egghead hawk (i'm not saying this is a good
thing, mind you, but i am saying that this presents us with one
obvious way to regain lost ground)... the 2nd wave of feminism
attempted to valorize the feminine, but i don't think we're there
yet...

reasonable people can disagree about these things, i'm sure...

but the more interesting part of your post, this notion that the
professoriate represents a "shadow country":  let me simply address a
paradox that lingers at the heart of what you're saying... i'm fond
of observing that when i move from one part of the country to the
next in order to teach (which i've done now, what, four times), i
have to deal with  local realities and values *immediately*, and not
b/c i have to shop at the local k-mart or eat at the local
mcdonald's, but b/c i have to deal with young adults who are eager to
learn and who embody local (or at least regional) value systems (i
could have written, local ideologies)... of course one can point to
an overarching u.s. ideology, but i am trying to address your
question on its own terms---that somehow the professoriate doesn't
confront local color, as it were...

and i'm saying that, in some sense, i have to address this latter
reality far more directly and with more urgency than were i, say, to
take a job at the local wal-mart...

this situation varies considerably from campus to campus... here at
illinois state, for instance, 98% of the student body hails from
illinois, so i know i'm dealing with midwestern values, quite apart
from the town itself (bloomington-normal)... while at cu (u of
colorado-boulder, for the uninitiated), i had to cope immediately
with a student body 50% of whom hailed from out of state... so the
student body there in fact might be deemed part of what you're
calling a "shadow country," and indeed (as you know) there are
localities that are (presently) fighting for all their worth to
prevent students from voting in their districts, on the basis of the
presumed temporary status of student residence... the counterargument
is that students actually spend (at least) four years (and tons o
cash) in said locale, and should thus have some say in what goes on
IN said locale...

and then of course there's the question of a mobile (some would say,
nomadic) society to consider, how so much of the
workforce---certainly, the upper-middle-class workforce---doesn't
stay in one place anyway...

which may be one way of saying that your "shadow country," mark,
really has more to do with class variables than with the
professoriate per se... i would agree that bringing deconstruction to
the prairie can feel awfully removed at times from, well, the
prairie... but bringing olive garden to the prairie may not be a
match made in heaven either, right?... but then, olive garden or
deconstruction, isn't the point really that egghead culture just
doesn't have a lot of options when it comes to how it earns a living,
and where?...

get down, get funky... interesting discussion...

best,

There is something coming down like the winds outside, the rainfall. =
Something that speaks like the rains outside. It's all moving but not =

I think you're glossing over some major differences between Olive Garden
and Illinois State. Of course one deals with one's students, who may spend
4 years of their lives separated from the community they usually inhabit
but fror the most part then return home. Fact is, Americans are not nearly
as peripatetic in general as is sometimes supposed. We move often, but
usually within pretty circumscribed regions--the  major movements--north to
Chicago, west to California and the southwest--have been multigenerational,
not merely the movement of a large mass at a given moment. You on the other
hand have lived in 4 different regions as an adult, and that's not so
common outside of the military and academia. In both cases social and
political life tend to remain within the group--academics, like military
personnel, tend to interact with each other to the exclusion  of the
townies, who tend to resent the alien presence among them even tho it pays
the bills.

Here's a test--which is a greater concern, a new mayor of Normal or a new
university president?

Here's another: how similar are the political ideology and concerns of
towniesand the university?

An exception to the above is the very few population centers where
intellectual (and artistic) life doesn't begin and end with the university
community. If the many universities in New York suddenly disappeared
intellectual life would continue without much change. But there are at most
three or four comparable places in the US.

check... yet my point was that the university, while locally fixed,
and olive garden, while (trans?)nationally corporate, have one thing
in common:  neither of them necessarily speaks to local realities, if
by local realities we mean something that is presumed to be
indigenous (term used advisedly) to a given locale... granted, olive
garden is predominantly staffed by locals---but here in bloomington,
i can only guess, staffed by (among others) local *college students*
(who are not themselves locals, technically)... those who run olive
garden, like those who run the (state) campus, are immensely more
flexible... olive garden might represent a career for cooks (i can't
say); similarly, the u employs staff who will forever draw a paycheck
from the u... what gets discussed in my classes, in any case, may
venture far afield from specific (let's say) rural concerns, and (i
hope!) far afield from olive garden concerns...

perhaps the u really is, then, as bill readings long ago suggested,
something of a transnational corporation... ergo we ought not to be
surprised at the interaction that occurs in such terms (i.e., that
profs are more likely to interact with other profs at other
institutions than with workers at olive garden)... but this then
would be an argument applicable to all such, what, "firms"... the u
would be no exception to the rule... and we ought in that event to
hold the academy responsible for *not being* an intellectual
stronghold, for instead fostering ultimately a business ethic...
which is to say, for being *too* congenial to the local demand for
skills, utility, and so forth (which invariably is what local demands
amount to, outside of the more "elite" institutions)...

or, show me the intellectual culture in the middle of illinois that
is attentive only to the intellectual culture (such as it is) in the
middle of illinois... or, is this what desire?... even if you *could*
show me such a thing, it would likely smack of a regionalism few on
this list would be comfortable endorsing... or, you can't blame the
academy for trying to expand the boundaries of the discourse...

seems like we've drifted away from our originary locus---hostility to
academic culture/professionalism---but that's ok...

what you *can* blame the academy for is fostering (or, not doing
enough, if anything, about) the town-gown split... it's often a
difficult thing to address, not least b/c of the anti-intellectualism
that we (both) agree haunts the u.s. public domain...

still, i would concur that it's simply not enough for academics to
turn their collective back on said domain, albeit i must admit to
being somewhat nonplussed at times as to how i might best respond to
such realities when i find myself (in some sense, against my will) in
a locale and region that feels not a little alien to me... "more corn
grown in mclean county than in any county in the u.s., and this has
been the case since 1880"... trying to be an agent of change in such
a setting is not the easiest thing in the world, as i'm sure you can
imagine...

and here again, i'll maintain that what fundamentally separates me
from town culture is that i've made what amounts to a class
transition, and one that brings with it some distance from (at
present) the general intellectual terrain of the township of which
i'm a resident... there are people here in town with whom i interact
who are not mobile, to be sure... only my hairdresser knows for
sure... but i work with faculty, too, who have lived here in town for
30 years, and i daresay they still have problems interacting with
local culture (and if not, why then i perhaps have problems
interacting with them!)... please don't misunderstand me---you know
me well enough to know that i can let my hair down... but---

so, setting aside those 4 or 5 (metro) places you have in mind, mark,
the situation wrt campus culture in general would seem to be much
like the situation i'm experiencing at present... my relative
mobility (i.e., having had to relocate to take an academic job
elsewhere), may separate me from those who are less mobile, to be
sure, but this doesn't quite explain why i find it difficult to hang
my hat here... and if the problem is anti-intellectualism, why then
the academy seems to me to offer not only a refuge from the storm,
but a chance to alter the local weather... and here again, i don't
wish to suggest that bloomington-normal is devoid of intellectual
culture outside of isu and illinoi-wesleyan, but frankly, the 13,000
state farm workers in this town (the town where state farm was
founded, along with steak 'n shake) don't seem to me to give a good
goddamn about those things most on this list hold near and dear to
their hearts, not least among which would be the examined life...

apologies for the twists and turns in the foregoing, but it seems to
me we can't complain about widespread anti-intellectual culture, and
then accuse an organ of intellectual culture---a faltering organ,
yes---for not endorsing local anti-intellectualisms...

best,

joe

"How many people reading NFL.com would even know who Derrida is apart from
Ravi and Jerrold?"

This seems like a pretty narrow preconception of who follows football. Ravi
& Jerrold aren't the only proof that people who follow football might know
more than just a little about Derrida: the fact that it's there on the
website shows that the NFL.com people think fans either do or should know
something about Derrida. And while the guy who writes the NFL.com news is no
expert, and called Derrida gibberish (like Marcus), he also gave less credit
to Derrida's critics.

In fact, I think the two brief paragraphs on Derrida were pretty great: for
those who don't know much or anything about Derrida, it gives a good
indication of his importance, difficulty, and controversial position,
without being afraid to get philosophical in its few sentences. For those
who do know something about Derrida, it isn't afraid to express an opinion,
while still being more respectful than the New York Times.

On top of that, there's this:

"What struck yours truly about Derrida's passing is that, as the Times
reported, his death "was announced by the president of France." Could you
imagine any recent president of the United States announcing the death of an
intellectual? Of a talk-show host, maybe. France is the one place in the
world a person can still become celebrated merely by thinking."

Well, France and the NFL website, evidently. The problem, I think, is about
underestimating the people. The French gov't doesn't underestimate the
intellectual concerns of its citizens. Americans, though, are underestimated
by our government, our newspapers, and even some of us on the Poetics List.
The NFL may just save us all.

Can someone tell me which different genres Derrida
wrote in--other than critical essays? Did he also
write novels or screenplays or any thing else like
that?

When I was in grad school I read things like "On
Grammatology" "Memoirs for Paul DeMan" etc. Are there
other lesser known weirder works anyone would like to
pass on?

Thanks,

Kazim

Diane Di Prima forwarded the very interesting proposition that follows my
note.

I would only hope that this Pentagon & Poets project becomes a kind of
Trojan Horse in which the experience  inside these new Veterans explodes and
becomes articulate in ways that open the consciousness of the country to the
facts and experience of this particular war. If I were a young MFA in
writing, I would seize the moment to enlist in this opportunity to teach and
to support this possibility.

I cannot believe that Dana Gioia is not, at least, unconsciously aware of
the potential for writing may be totally contrary to his partnership with
Paul Wolfolitz in promoting the creative hopes of soldiers. God bless his
unconscious!

Poetry and the Pentagon: Unholy Alliance?

By Eleanor Wilner
<http://www.poetrymagazine.org/wilner_oct04_prose.html>

On April 20 of this year Dana Gioia, Chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, in tandem with Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, announced Operation
Homecoming: Writing the War Experience. The program is
described as 'an NEA project to help soldiers write
about their experiences in war,' and it plans to bring
writers to military bases to conduct workshops for
soldiers returning from combat. It will also publish an
anthology which, according to their website, will be
'open to active US military personnel and their
immediate families' and will be a 'nationally promoted
anthology of wartime writing that will be sold in
bookstores and will be distributed free by the Arts
Endowment to military installations, schools, and
libraries.'

The project is being carried out in cooperation with the
Armed Forces and Defense Department and the Southern
Arts Federation, and has been funded ($250,000 of its
$300,000 cost) by the Boeing Company, one of the US's
leading defense contractors, and therefore a major
recipient of our tax dollars and a corporation that
profits from war.

A handsome red, white, and blue booklet-whose cover
bears a moving photo of a helmet holding flag-stamped
letters to a GI-contains the photos, bios, and book
covers of thirteen well-published authors of fiction and
poetry (some veterans of earlier wars, some from
military families, many whose writing is principally
about war) who will lead the workshops, and another
smaller group of well-known writers who read excerpts
from war-related texts or tips on writing on a
promotional CD.

What we have here is a program that seems designed to be
proof against all criticism, as if to raise any
questions about it is to seem to target those deserving
soldiers and the writers who have signed on. But what if
we look behind these unassailable shields? Are these
returning troops once again being used as a shield
against the scrutiny of the very policy which put them
in harm's way in the first place? Will Operation
Homecoming serve them? Will it serve poetry? Or is it
designed to serve quite another purpose? 'The Defense
Department,' said the Washington Post (April 20, 2004),
'believes the writing will reflect positively on
military life. I don't have any concerns,' says
Principle Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel
and Readiness Charles S. Abell. We tend to remember
those things which are good."

As a thirty-year veteran of the teaching of poetry, and
an observer of the current chasm between public rhetoric
and the language of experience, as well as the growing
carnage, I read all this with incredulity and dismay.
The sponsors, the context, the timing-how could it be
more wrong? A military base? Soldiers still on active
duty and under orders? Just returned from the violence
and trauma of combat? Asked to write about those still
raw experiences? Was this a context or a circumstance in
which deep disclosure, or even reportage, could-or
should-be invited? Are these writers qualified to pry
open the doors to what may be scenes of inner
desolation?

Bruce Weigl, a Bronze Star veteran of the Vietnam war,
author of seven books of poetry, and former director of
the MFA Program at Penn State, shares these concerns:

   To expect young men and women who are just returned
   from a combat mission where they have seen and done
   and had done to them unspeakable things is to ask
   far too much of them. . . . As returning veterans,
   they are far too close to the war to trust their own
   immediate responses; they all need to come to terms
   with what they've been through and what they've
   seen, and then they'll be ready to tell the stories
   that no one wants to hear.

What is it like for a returning veteran to write under
the aegis of the military, where language necessarily
serves a far different purpose than it does for the
poet? Jan Barry, also a poet and decorated Vietnam
veteran, tells of his experience:

   In 1964 I was appointed to West Point from the ranks
   after serving ten months in Vietnam. I was invited
   by upperclassmen at the military academy to write
   about my experiences for a student publication. I
   found it impossible to do. The whole mood at West
   Point was akin to a football team preparing for a
   big game against a rival team. I was stumped as to
   how to write, in that atmosphere, a serious
   reflection on life in a war zone of our own making.
   To find the space I needed to write more critically,
   I resigned from West Point and an intended military
   career. When I submitted my resignation, a kindly
   colonel called me into his office and told me a
   story about his brother, who had also wanted to be a
   writer and grew up in a military family. His father,
   a general, ordered the brother to stay in the
   military and write. 'You can stay in the Army and
   write official histories,' the colonel said
   enthusiastically. He could not conceive of the
   critical perspective I had acquired in Vietnam, in
   which official statements were often wildly
   unrelated to the facts in the field.

I have pulled from my shelf a slim volume of poems
edited by Jan Barry, Larry Rottmann, and Basil T.
Parquet in 1972, which was for me a touchstone in those
war years, a way inside Vietnam's reality, as it was for
many: Winning Hearts and Minds: War Poems by Vietnam
Veterans. It was a grassroots veterans volume, put
together on Barry's kitchen table, dedicated to the
children of Indochina, and published by 1st Casualty
Press, named from the famous quote by Aeschylus in the
fifth century b.c.: 'In war, truth is the first
casualty.'

'[O]ne wonders at the shape of this generation's
returning war narratives,' says Kevin Bowen, also a poet
and Vietnam veteran, and Director of the William Joiner
Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at
the University of Massachusetts, which has offered
writing workshops to veterans since 1987. 'Will this war
have its own Winning Hearts and Minds? Perhaps not, if
Washington has its say.' In his protest against
Operation Homecoming (which, by the way, borrows its
name from the repatriation of American POWs at the end
of the Vietnam war), he writes in the veterans online
magazine Intervention: 'Beyond the language of self-help
and therapeutic' aspects of writing, beyond the back-
patting, it is not difficult to see in the project an
effort to establish an official canon of writing from
the century's first wars, neatly packaged, ready for
mass distribution and classroom use.'

What's the rush here? Why doesn't the NEA help send
discharged veterans to colleges and bona fide writing
programs, investing public arts money to support their
writing in educational settings, where, as Bowen says,
'it will be fostered over time and not immediately co-
opted.' And give them the chance to develop some
historical insight, and to contextualize experience in
more than the blinding exigencies of the moment?

Indeed, this project appears to be an attempt to preempt
the immediate (and even archival) record of this war by
its combatants. It is well to remember here that the NEA
is an arm of the government, its chairman and board
political appointments by the administration. In the
Guardian (April 20, 2004), Dana Gioia was quoted as
saying: 'I have noticed a lot of similarities between
the military world and the literary world. Both are
highly specialized and highly professionalized. And when
that happens, you tend not to see a lot outside your
immediate world.' Perhaps Gioia was counting on this,
thinking that other poets, less canny than he, and lost
in a doze at the shuttered windows of their ivory
towers, wouldn't notice the political ramifications of
this project. And though he mentions in his eerily
cheerful introduction every great epic of war from the
Iliad to War and Peace (works written long after the
events), we might question whether it is literature that
can be produced or even encouraged under such
circumstances.

In that same glossy, glamorous booklet, each writer's
page features a brief, enlarged, bold-face quotation
from one of his or her books. It doesn't matter what the
name of the author is since the following quote is
lifted out of context and therefore from the frame of
its meaning in the original narrative, and so can only
be construed in its effect as a sound-bite in the
context of Operation Homecoming. Here is the very first
quotation:

   He left a pause. He might have been considering
   telling her everything about himself. Then he said,
   'Like most military people, I hate war. But there
   are tigers in the world, you know.'

The effect and purpose of these words in this context
goes without saying. What does require pause is those
tigers. When promoting a war, which means authorizing
the killing of other human beings, it is necessary to
use a language which robs them of their humanity. There
are several ways this is done. One is by seeing them as
members of another species-something bestial, primitive,
predatory. Perhaps that is why most animals do not
murder their own kind: they are not subject to this
confusion. Another way, which is characteristic of
military language, is to denature the enemy by the use
of a detached, Latinate, and bloodless language, so that
one 'neutralizes' opposing forces, or the burning,
mutilation, and killing of civilians is masked as
'collateral damage.'

At the same time that the enemy's reality is demonized
or neutralized (or both), the actions of one's own side,
in military parlance, are redescribed in terms which
reverse meaning, disowning the real harm that is being
done: the US missions involving massive dropping of
incendiary bombs over North Vietnam were called
'Sherwood Forest' and 'Pink Rose.' Poetry, which is
above all 'learning to call things by the right name,'
has, therefore, goals incommensurate with the use of
language by the military in the conduct of war.

'I just want to remember / the dead piled high behind
the curtain,' writes the contemporary Palestinian poet
Mahmoud Darwish. It is the poet's task, I too believe,
to make us feel the full weight of the bodies hidden
behind the rhetoric and the falsifying parlance, to
embody truth, to remember the dismembered human form.
'For my enemy is dead,' wrote Walt Whitman, 'a man as
divine as myself is dead.' 'It is difficult,' William
Carlos Williams famously wrote, 'to get the news from
poems / yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of
what is found there.' And I am taking that miserable
dying just now as a literal and collective fact.

Once again we are at war; in the words of Yeats, 'the
nightmare / Rides upon sleep.' We stand at what has been
called by Lionel Trilling 'the dark and bloody
crossroads where literature and politics meet,' not by
choice-but by circumstance. As poets, we do not choose
our subjects; the imagination is a force which can be
invited, but it cannot be commanded. In fact, in those
moments when we are poets (and we live many more when we
are not), we must live, like Cicero in a poem by Gibbons
Ruark, 'in that singular province that was never
Caesar's.'

Returning at last to the first great war epic of the
Western tradition, the Iliad, I remind us all that it is
written from both sides, that the eye of the poet moves
back and forth between the Greek camp and the city of
Troy. There is no enemy: simply the ambition of
Agamemnon, the lust of Paris, the wrath of Achilles, the
laughter of the gods, the tragedy of war in which are
'hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong
souls / of heroes.' The city of Troy is put to the
torch, its women and children enslaved, and the epic
ends, as all wars end, with a funeral pyre and a handful
of bones.

It should be clear from what has been said that it is
not the conjunction of poetry and soldiers which is
problematic. On the contrary, sustained exposure to
poetry might serve as one antidote to the violence and
divisive language of war, and become the lifeline it has
been for a number of Vietnam combat veterans who
survived the postwar years, and whose words helped
others to do the same. This project sadly mars this
year's generous NEA literature grants, essential to so
many small presses and writer's support groups. For this
particular project arouses suspicion about its ultimate
purpose-doubts fed by its feel-good rhetoric, its slick
packaging, its inimical setting, its timing, its cozy
insularity, the vested interests of its sponsors: the
Pentagon and Boeing, and its disingenuous disclaimers
that none of this will affect the selection of materials
for the anthology which the NEA plans to widely
disseminate.

'Most alarming to many of us,' writes Kevin Bowen,
'Operation Homecoming threatens to move the NEA into the
business of supporting the generation of propaganda, a
wartime exercise that is not part of its mission, and
does writers, veterans, and the public a great
disservice.' To which I say Amen.

Subtext presents the second of two special events, featuring CRITICS AS P=
ERFORMERS. This second event includes presentations by Charlie Altieri an=
d Marjorie Perloff at the Henry Art Gallery. Donations for admission will=
 be taken at the door on the evening of the performance. Free admission t=
o the Henry Gallery. The event starts at 4:00pm.

CRITICS AS PERFORMERS

Well known critics of contemporaneity / postmodernity take to the stage, =
exploring what it means to be a critic as performer. Casting off their pr=
epared remarks &/or taking them up anew, these critics enter into the spa=
ce of their own abandon. No longer avant or apres la lettre, but extempor=
aneous, expropriating, exfoliating, these critics subsume the excess of t=
heir own presence, do just what they want to do, for an evening of wind s=
heer, free fall, perspicacious pleasures, serious maladies and the like.

BIOS OF ALTIERI/PERLOFF

Charles Altieri, who spent more than a decade in Seattle at the UW, is cu=
rrently Professor of English at University of California - Berkeley. He i=
s the author of numerous books on critical theory and literary modernism,=
 and a leading authority on expressive theories of art. He has a new book=
 from Cornell University Press titled The Particulars of Rapture: An Aest=
hetics of the Affects. His books include: Painterly Abstraction in Modern=
ist American Poetry (Cambridge); Canons and Consequences (Northwestern); =
Subjective Agency: A Theory of First-Person Expressivity and its Social I=
mplications; Postmodernism Now: Essays on Contemporaneity in the Arts.

Marjorie Perloff is professor emeritus at Stanford and is author of innum=
erable critical books and essays, including The Poetics of Indeterminacy,=
 and most recently The Vienna Paradox (a memoir from New Directions). See=
 http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/perloff/vita.html.

The future Subtext 2004 schedule is:
November 3, 2004 - David Abel (Portland) and William Fox (LA)
December 1, 2004 - Catriona Strang and Nancy Shaw (both Vancouver, BC)

Further to a point I attempted earlier, that is, as a non-US person I can't comment with any authority on internal political
(academic or not) particularities of said US, I'm delighted, tickled and fascinated by the exchange between Mark and Joe. One thing
I notice, as a kind of shading, in the discussions and diatribes and debate that has followed (on this list) Derrida's departure to
other shores and tenures is the way Derrida is seen as 'French', a presumably homogenous identity, whereas what is 'US' breaks down,
like a cloud of bees, into a swarm of specifics and separates that to the outsider seem all the same. The combination of insularity
and global aspirations of the US, of its culture, fascinate me. Of course, being British, and even English, I am naturally superior
and above everything, although my own particularity can be easily found at a convenient point (in a locked and keyless box) within
an irregular triangle drawn between John O'Gaunt (it really exists) and Wigston Parva in Leicestershire and Wooten Wawen in
Warwickshire. A sign nearby says 'Beware of the Vowels'.

Anyhow, loving all this

All the Best (with seriousness and a grin)

Before the America's 9/11, there was another one in
Santiago, Chile when the dictator Augusto Pinochet
used Hawker Jets to bomb the Presidential Palace on
September 11, 1973 to remove the democratically
elected President Salvador Allende. As a counter
reaction to the bombing, Casagrande, an underground
literary organization of young poets born during
Pinochet, rented a helicopter and dropped 100,000
poems on the Presidential Palace on March 23, 2001.
They followed with a bombing of Dubrovnik, Croatia and
Gernika, Spain -- both cities bombed in the past.

Absolutely agree with you, Aldon, as a matter of fact, what I was attempting, no doubt imperfectly, was to say how Derrida is
figured, as it were, both for and against, as being 'French' i.e. intellectyouall. It seems to me that is a kind of blob image.
Myself, I am neither for nor against Derrida, I don't know his works well enough, what I have seen I've found quite stimulating, but
there again I'd echo Dr Nudel's remark about rotten translations, they are a barrier, my modest French is not sufficient for the
originals. I am very wary of academic-political issues in any areas of discussion these days, I'm not an academic myself, I find
myself ending up with said entity of late, and I don't know the rules of whatever games that, in such contexts, can be played. That
isn't meant as a slur on academe, far from it, I like you profs.

But remember, there is such a thing as poetry, and even poets, in their slanted hats, that pre-exists theory, and that poetry,
rather than theory, to paraphrase an earlier post, comes very close to sex in its gorgeous desirability, its promiscuity, its
devotion, its broken promises, its infatuated love.

And you can't get a grant, a position, a credit, a tenure on that!

Maybe a pat on the back if you're lucky!

All the Best

I'm not sure what you mean by "Derrida's departure to other shores and
tenures is the way Derrida is seen as 'French', a presumably homogenous
identity."  His first departure to an other shore and university was TO
France FROM Algeria -- his origins as a Francophone Algerian Jew would seem
to argue against the homogeneity of French identity, non?

The town and gown divide Joe and Mark are talking about seems, like most
issues, much more complex than the usual two-sided formation might make
manifest. More nomadic, even more Derridaean approaches might make more
sense. For example, speaking personally as someone who is not at a
university, living in a metro area of nearly a million people (and growing
fast) of which a university is one of the most noticeable parts, I find
that quite a few of my relations are with people at the university. Yet my
local identification, or one of the primary ones, is with the local arts
community. People within that community tend to have more interaction with
each other, and with other artists around the country; much like academics
interact primarily amongst themselves, and amongst their peers around the
country -- not a lot of difference there, in some respects. My guess is
that attorneys in this city interact primarily among themselves, to some
extent among their peers around the state, particularly those in the
state's capital and largest city, and with peers around the country. So I
don't know that there is anything peculiar to academia about this tendency
to affiliate with peers. I certainly see members of all groups, though, at
community festivals, larger cultural events (both inside and outside the
university), and most often at local grocery stores. At different phases of
my life, I've interacted with members of all these groups at day care
groups for our children and other events that speak of identities much more
numerous and interwoven than any "town/gown" vision can encompass. I've
served with them on arts commission panels and committees, on school site
councils, and in other respects.

My interactions with other people in other communities around the nation
don't particularly honor the town/gown divide. That is, first, as a
"towner" in this divide, a large portion of my existence is about relating
to people not in my own town at all. Second, my interactions with those
outside this town range widely between town people and gown people. Third,
a lot and probably most of those people I interact with are not
particularly stuck in either a town or gown identity. That non-split seems
somewhat more predominant in people I know and see in larger cities, who
are active in their poetry community (and other communities) on a fairly
wide basis not restricted by gown or town or city or region or state or
even nation. It's difficult for me to think of many academics I know as
largely limited by their academic affiliation. It's also difficult for me
to think of many non-academic poets and artists I know as limited
geographically to their local town.

This is not to deny that there are social and political blocks comprised
more of "university" and "non-university" interests, and there are probably
some issues best viewed through such a narrow dualistic lens. But in many
ways, these are crude reductions.

The NY Times has done a good service, perhaps helping undo the Jonathan=20
Kandell piece on Derrida. This one, by Mark C. Taylor, can be found here if=

What Derrida Really Meant
By MARK C. TAYLOR

Along with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, who=20
died last week in Paris at the age of 74, will be remembered as one of the=
=20
three most important philosophers of the 20th century. No thinker in the=20
last 100 years had a greater impact than he did on people in more fields=20
and different disciplines. Philosophers, theologians, literary and art=20
critics, psychologists, historians, writers, artists, legal scholars and=20
even architects have found in his writings resources for insights that have=
=20
led to an extraordinary revival of the arts and humanities during the past=
=20
four decades. And no thinker has been more deeply misunderstood.

To people addicted to sound bites and overnight polls, Mr. Derrida's works=
=20
seem hopelessly obscure. It is undeniable that they cannot be easily=20
summarized or reduced to one-liners. The obscurity of his writing, however,=
=20
does not conceal a code that can be cracked, but reflects the density and=20
complexity characteristic of all great works of philosophy, literature and=
=20
art. Like good French wine, his works age well. The more one lingers with=20
them, the more they reveal about our world and ourselves.

What makes Mr. Derrida's work so significant is the way he brought insights=
=20
of major philosophers, writers, artists and theologians to bear on problems=
=20
of urgent contemporary interest. Most of his infamously demanding texts=20
consist of careful interpretations of canonical writers in the Western=20
philosophical, literary and artistic traditions - from Plato to Joyce. By=20
reading familiar works against the grain, he disclosed concealed meanings=20
that created new possibilities for imaginative expression.

Mr. Derrida's name is most closely associated with the often cited but=20
rarely understood term "deconstruction." Initially formulated to define a=20
strategy for interpreting sophisticated written and visual works,=20
deconstruction has entered everyday language. When responsibly understood,=
=20
the implications of deconstruction are quite different from the misleading=
=20
clich=E9s often used to describe a process of dismantling or taking things=
=20
apart. The guiding insight of deconstruction is that every structure - be=20
it literary, psychological, social, economic, political or religious - that=
=20
organizes our experience is constituted and maintained through acts of=20
exclusion. In the process of creating something, something else inevitably=
=20
gets left out.

These exclusive structures can become repressive - and that repression=20
comes with consequences. In a manner reminiscent of Freud, Mr. Derrida=20
insists that what is repressed does not disappear but always returns to=20
unsettle every construction, no matter how secure it seems. As an Algerian=
=20
Jew writing in France during the postwar years in the wake of=20
totalitarianism on the right (fascism) as well as the left (Stalinism), Mr.=
=20
Derrida understood all too well the danger of beliefs and ideologies that=20
divide the world into diametrical opposites: right or left, red or blue,=20
good or evil, for us or against us. He showed how these repressive=20
structures, which grew directly out of the Western intellectual and=20
cultural tradition, threatened to return with devastating consequences. By=
=20
struggling to find ways to overcome patterns that exclude the differences=20
that make life worth living, he developed a vision that is consistently=20
ethical.

And yet, supporters on the left and critics on the right have misunderstood=
=20
this vision. Many of Mr. Derrida's most influential followers appropriated=
=20
his analyses of marginal writers, works and cultures as well as his=20
emphasis on the importance of preserving differences and respecting others=
=20
to forge an identity politics that divides the world between the very=20
oppositions that it was Mr. Derrida's mission to undo: black and white, men=
=20
and women, gay and straight. Betraying Mr. Derrida's insights by creating a=
=20
culture of political correctness, his self-styled supporters fueled the=20
culture wars that have been raging for more than two decades and continue=20
to frame political debate.
To his critics, Mr. Derrida appeared to be a pernicious nihilist who=20
threatened the very foundation of Western society and culture. By insisting=
=20
that truth and absolute value cannot be known with certainty, his=20
detractors argue, he undercut the very possibility of moral judgment. To=20
follow Mr. Derrida, they maintain, is to start down the slippery slope of=20
skepticism and relativism that inevitably leaves us powerless to act=20
responsibly.

This is an important criticism that requires a careful response. Like Kant,=
=20
Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, Mr. Derrida does argue that transparent truth=20
and absolute values elude our grasp. This does not mean, however, that we=20
must forsake the cognitive categories and moral principles without which we=
=20
cannot live: equality and justice, generosity and friendship. Rather, it is=
=20
necessary to recognize the unavoidable limitations and inherent=20
contradictions in the ideas and norms that guide our actions, and do so in=
=20
a way that keeps them open to constant questioning and continual revision.=
=20
There can be no ethical action without critical reflection.

During the last decade of his life, Mr. Derrida became preoccupied with=20
religion and it is in this area that his contribution might well be most=20
significant for our time. He understood that religion is impossible without=
=20
uncertainty. Whether conceived of as Yahweh, as the father of Jesus Christ,=
=20
or as Allah, God can never be fully known or adequately represented by=20
imperfect human beings.

And yet, we live in an age when major conflicts are shaped by people who=20
claim to know, for certain, that God is on their side. Mr. Derrida reminded=
=20
us that religion does not always give clear meaning, purpose and certainty=
=20
by providing secure foundations. To the contrary, the great religious=20
traditions are profoundly disturbing because they all call certainty and=20
security into question. Belief not tempered by doubt poses a mortal danger.

As the process of globalization draws us ever closer in networks of=20
communication and exchange, there is an understandable longing for=20
simplicity, clarity and certainty. This desire is responsible, in large=20
measure, for the rise of cultural conservatism and religious fundamentalism=
=20
- in this country and around the world. True believers of every stripe -=20
Muslim, Jewish and Christian - cling to beliefs that, Mr. Derrida warns,=20
threaten to tear apart our world.

Fortunately, he also taught us that the alternative to blind belief is not=
=20
simply unbelief but a different kind of belief - one that embraces=20
uncertainty and enables us to respect others whom we do not understand. In=
=20
a complex world, wisdom is knowing what we don't know so that we can keep=20
the future open.

In the two decades I knew Mr. Derrida, we had many meetings and exchanges.=
=20
In conversation, he listened carefully and responded helpfully to questions=
=20
whether posed by undergraduates or colleagues. As a teacher, he gave freely=
=20
of his time to several generations of students.
But small things are the measure of the man. In 1986, my family and I were=
=20
in Paris and Mr. Derrida invited us to dinner at his house in the suburbs=20
20 miles away. He insisted on picking us up at our hotel, and when we=20
arrived at his home he presented our children with carnival masks. At 2=20
a.m., he drove us back to the city. In later years, when my son and=20
daughter were writing college papers on his work, he sent them letters and=
=20
postcards of encouragement as well as signed copies of several of his=20
books. Jacques Derrida wrote eloquently about the gift of friendship but in=
=20
these quiet gestures - gestures that served to forge connections among=20
individuals across their differences - we see deconstruction in action.

Mark C. Taylor, a professor of the humanities at Williams College and a=20
visiting professor of architecture and religion at Columbia, is the author,=
=20
most recently, of "Confidence Games: Money and Markets in a World Without=20
Redemption."

Ah yes, they do these things also in Europe. We watched a documentary,
the same identical conditions. I have been a vegetarian for about 20
years now, partly because of this.

I wondered about that, but then how is it that "death" is the way he is
seen as French????

Dear Editor,

Concerning your article on =93Richfield teen charged with attempted=20
murder,=94 By Seth Rowe Sun Newspapers, (Created 10/14/2004)

There seems to be some major acts of ignorance and thoughtlessness in=20
this article by Seth Rowe.

1. the victim who Seth Rowe labeled "a transvestite prostitute," who=20
supposedly received that information from the Police,  goes on to state=20=

this individual, =93described as a transvestite prostitute. ((by)=20
Hennepin County court records  . . . had been cited for prostitution in=20=

2003 and 2004. "  does this make a difference in a hate crime or is=20
this voyeurism and and a act of discrimination?

So, the question would be, what do the police in your community know of=20=

the difference between; transgender, transvestite and transsexual. I=20
would take it none! And is it the reporters place to defer all=20
knowledge and reporting to the police in labeling humans. it is a known=20=

fact that police are aggressive in their labeling, and that is backed=20
by criminal code and pathological behavior models that are usually=20
outdate, not an understanding of the diversity of humanity. basicly are=20=

to you labeled a "bad" person, so they can arrest you. not how to=20
understand individuals.

and I am sure you know in most cases, many Transfemales cannot afford=20
surgery or can get good jobs; they are reduced to prostitution, just=20
like the history of woman in society. and just because this individual=20=

may or may not have had a penis does not make them a transvestite or=20
male.

also, your are speaking here of a victim, who you further victimize by=20=

using overt prejudicial and discriminatory language. Is there a reason=20=

to know a history of some one who was shot, or is it you slight of=20
hand, back handed way of justify it? very poor journalism.

2. the victim was 19, the alleged shooter was 16, what makes one a man=20=

and one a boy?

or is it in this case, more apprehensible for a "man" to be=20
cross-dressed, or to be transgender, then a boy. the way you wrote this=20=

creates a vast power differential i.e, boy over man... it sound like=20
"the boy" had to protect himself from the terrible deviant prostitute=20
with a criminal record." come on, there's only three years apart in=20
age...

please, clean up your reporting, get some training on gender diversity,=20=

and stop victimizing females.

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating

Joe: Your post underlines the degree to which I oversimplified. While I
think my point largely holds for most four-year-plus-graduate- programs
schools,there's considerable variety beyond my generalizations. Junior
colleges tend to be much more local, for instance, and more likely to be
influenced by the local job market than privately endowed schols or schools
ruled from the state capitol, tho of course those are hardly immune.

I wasn't at any rate trying to be prescriptive--I was laying out what I
think is one of the major causes of hostility to the professoriate, that
it's often seen as a foreign intrusion. I'm not sure if this could be
fixed, the cultural divide being, as you point out, in many places as
profound as it is. What I would say is that in many cases there's been
precious little attempt to do so.

Here's a question. We all know that faculties operate under all sorts of
hiring constraints, some self-imposed some not. Aside from the obvious "do
I want to live with this person for the rest of my career" issues,
faculties tend to hire in support of one or another alliance within a given
department, and that often plays out along various lines of perceived needs
for inclusion or parity, whether racial or gender-driven. How often is
relevance to locale even an issue?

I'm not suggesting an appeal to the volk. I'm talking about the possibility
of promoting some kind of dialogue. It seems to me that it would be
perfectly reasonable for a school like yours, for instance, to try to
recruit top-flight scholars of the literature or history or sociology etc.
of the midwest. Or if there's a significant local ethnic community perhaps
a scholar who speaks to that group. A nod in that direction, not a
wholesale investment in provincialism. Maybe there'd even be a few faculty
who feel comfortable on both sides of the campus gate.

The answer to my query -- thanks to those replied b/c -- is that
indeed that acknowledgement to "Kathy Alexander" was for Kathy
Acker's help in preparation of the book Metaphors on Vision, by
Stan Brakhage.  P. Adams Sitney (early championer of exp. film
and author of Visionary Film) told me that she helped out by
running errands to and from the Film Culture office to George
Maciunas, who was designing the book, and proofing the text.
It was Sitney, as a kind of manager of production, who gave the
acknowledgements list to Brakhage to put in the book, so there
was not some kind of relationship between the (very young) Acker
and him.  There was, however, a relationship between her and
Sitney.  He told me she was his girlfriend.

Thanks to Mr. Sitney's graciousness and good memory, i also
learned several other things in this conversation.  One of which
was that Ruth Witt-Diamant, founding director of the Poetry
Center, was a very close and constant friend of Sidney Peterson,
one of the early and stalwart members of the SF exp film
community.

None of this information is intended to be gossip about the "art
stars," but just a documentation of the deep connections between
filmmaking and poetry -- which of course many of you already
know about.

i have to say that i think Greg Easterbrook, author of said column, is a
total, not to put too fine point on it, dork, and his compliment of
Derrida is rather back-handed.  i know what the NFL is, thank you, which
means the recent victories of the Pats in the Super Bowl means something
to me, but i would never look at NFL.com.  in any case, let's admit that
those write and read about sports are probably closer in outlook to your
average sensitive literary male.  so knowing about New England's spread
against the Seahawks and Derrida aren't necessarily signs of subverted
masculinity.

i do however track college basketball fervently.  still don't know why
football is _the_ American sport for guys.  go see a martial arts
tournament sometime and you will realize that football players are mostly
one trick ponys.  that and it does terrible things to ankles, knees, and
health in general.

hopes to shine a light upon the fiction publications of independent =

by participating writers and editors during the afternoon (from =
11am-3pm) of the 16th at the Library. The public will hear tomorrow's =
literary giants today!

I'm glad for this question's coming up, because I have been meaning to
write a notice about an audio poetry journal called _Frequency_ that came
out earlier this year. And I'll begin by affirming the suspicion already
raised here, that recordings of poetry don't get listened to all that
often, even by people who collect them. Am I alone in feeling that this has
more to do with listening habits than inadequate distribution? People tend
to use recordings in order to shrug off mental burdens, not add to them.

I let months go by after buying my copy of _Frequency_. Then, I put it on.
It's so great!!! Mainly because it's so revealing. _Frequency_ features 20+
readers & performers, mostly from the eastern U.S. which is an added bonus
for me because I don't get out there much. Is that why I'd never heard
Caroline Bergvall? She is heard performing a slow, spell-like piece called
"Ambient Fish" for a live audience, whether in her own dialect or one put
on for the occasion I can't tell. It's creepy and beautiful at the same
time --and the recording is really skillful, the way it brings out the
echoing hush of the hall. Such a contrast to the next track, which has
Alice Notley reading "Circa '81" in what sounds like a very confined space.
Electrifying, and instructive for the way she starts out "behind the beat"
and then *overtakes it* as the poem gets more and more emotionally
strenuous. Is she letting us know that she could have retained the
appearance of control over her delivery, but chose not to? Then 2 tracks by
the late Gil Ott, which were really great to hear after all the kind
remembrances that were posted to this list. He sounds like an exceedingly
kind and reedy man. --I wish I had time to go through the whole thing
track-by-track like this --even the "misses" are, as I say, instructive. I
guess I'm most grateful for the Douglas Oliver tracks at the end, five of
them all in a row. "The only poets I have to struggle against, because none
wrote more beautifully post-war of the perfection and terror of crystal."
Great showing by younger poets also.

I'll repeat the ordering information that appears on the inside CD cover:
"For a copy of this CD, send $11 to FREQUENCY Magazine, P.O. Box 22521,
Philadelphia PA 19110." Checks should probably be made payable to one of
the editors (CAConrad and Magdalena Zurawski). They're also soliciting
recorded work on audio CD or tape, but you really ought to buy the thing
first. And be warned what a revealing medium it is! Even more so than a
live reading, in some ways LRSN

Go Steelers! And I'll admit having a twinge of man-crush on Tiki Barber. =
Though like Derrida himself, I grew up on la juga bonita and still have =
a nose for the net. Sport is like nationalism distilled to certain =
prescheduled broadcasts where anything can happen. a phenomenon that =
reacts directly with a subjective psyche's attention and esteem. The =
angst of the Sox fan is palpable here in CT, no less than the paranoia =
of someone who believes in superstitions for their team, which =
ultimately becomes a fallacious extension of the self. Perhaps, to give =
props, "the accused is thus someone who re-establishes contact between =
the corpora and the ceremonies of several dialects." The ceremony of =
sport is in part the dialect of capital, but there's still something =
gracile and unexpected about a volleyed ball hit with the instep onto =
someone's head that redeems the whole lot in my mind.    =20

i have to say that i think Greg Easterbrook, author of said column, is a
total, not to put too fine point on it, dork, and his compliment of
Derrida is rather back-handed.  i know what the NFL is, thank you, which
means the recent victories of the Pats in the Super Bowl means something
to me, but i would never look at NFL.com.  in any case, let's admit that
those write and read about sports are probably closer in outlook to your
average sensitive literary male.  so knowing about New England's spread
against the Seahawks and Derrida aren't necessarily signs of subverted
masculinity.

i do however track college basketball fervently.  still don't know why
football is _the_ American sport for guys.  go see a martial arts
tournament sometime and you will realize that football players are mostly
one trick ponys.  that and it does terrible things to ankles, knees, and
health in general.

I'm rather fond of an essay/"memoir" he wrote (in the 1980s I believe) =
about
his experience as a "greasy foreigner" professor (the phrase is his own) =
at
UC Irvine. Lots of tongue-in-cheek observations about being the Other in =
a
surreal, manicured, Reagan-conservative suburb (read: "Foreign =
intellectual,
stay away from our women!") leading to a rambling review of a local art
installation piece dealing with race & violence. After stumbling through
difficult bits of his more famous essays in school, I was actually =
thrilled
to see him, in a relatively "light" moment, venting off on Southern
California and getting very personal about it. Proof that the man had a =
real
sense of humor as well as a radical mind.

Thing is, I can't remember the title of this book. Can anyone?

Charles: Neither this medium nor my available time admit of much more than
generalizations and apologies for generalizations. That said, Tucson is in
my experience somewhat unique, at least in the arts. When I lived there the
city had something under a half million people and there were almost no
environs, but there was an active, unusually cohesive artistic community
that went beyond the university. That interaction was and remains somewhat
more limited, I think, than you portray it, and your own access has been as
far as I'm aware by dint of a lot of years of knocking at the door. But
nonetheless a more open environment. It doesn't hurt that the university is
in the middle oif the city and has lots of parking, including a good many
streets where if one wants to make the hike one can park gratis. And Tucson
is in general more open to difference than most places and more
communal--the endless rounds of free parties that the city throws for
itself attests to this.

So, let's add to the variables that all cities and city/university
relations are not alike, and that personality counts. In the main I think
my point holds up. Universities are often seen as Martian colonies, albeit
as profitable ones to have around. UCSD has little to do with La Jolla,
it's not conveniently located, parking is expensive and scarce, and hours
of facilities open to the public, like libraries, are often inconvenient
for those off-campus. In the numerous gatherings of faculty members I've
attended, because I've known members of the faculty in other non-university
non-San Diego contexts for many years,  I'm usually the only non-affiliated
person.

Even at Columbia, where I did my graduate work, only on one occasion in the
three years in which I ran a reading series in a very public venue across
the street from campus did a faculty member attend, and grad students in
thee writing program never ever showed up. Tho of course in NY this matters
very little.

I wonder how different the situation is at other campuses--closer to the
picture I paint, or to yours?

Mark

You can bet that the book will be censored of negative poems about the war
and the Bush Administration.
 I'm sure Wolfowitz has propaganda in mind.
But a true book of poems by Iraq vets would be an interesting follow-up to
Poets Against the War.

So the clause in question is:

"One thing I notice is the way Derrida is seen as 'French'".

and not:

"Derrida's departure to other shores and tenures is the way Derrida is seen
as 'French'".

But then, every sentence contains the seeds of its opposite.

Apologies, I mixed up my memory of deconstructionists who were imported =
by
Irvine -- the book I'm thinking of is Pacific Wall by Lyotard, not =
Derrida. A
fascinating read though, nonetheless. Especially in light of the =
parallel
list discussion regarding university intellectuals and their "local =
color"...

Subject: RE: questions about Derrida



I'm rather fond of an essay/"memoir" he wrote (in the 1980s I believe) =
about
his experience as a "greasy foreigner" professor (the phrase is his own) =
at
UC Irvine. Lots of tongue-in-cheek observations about being the Other in =
a
surreal, manicured, Reagan-conservative suburb (read: "Foreign =
intellectual,
stay away from our women!") leading to a rambling review of a local art
installation piece dealing with race & violence. After stumbling through
difficult bits of his more famous essays in school, I was actually =
thrilled
to see him, in a relatively "light" moment, venting off on Southern
California and getting very personal about it. Proof that the man had a =
real
sense of humor as well as a radical mind.

Thing is, I can't remember the title of this book. Can anyone?

Can someone tell me which different genres Derrida

wrote in--other than critical essays? Did he also

write novels or screenplays or any thing else like

that?

When I was in grad school I read things like "On

Grammatology" "Memoirs for Paul DeMan" etc. Are there

other lesser known weirder works anyone would like to

pass on?

Thanks,

MARC ADORNATO is an Art-video producer, robot sculptor, musician, and graphics
expert, House of Commons Videographer, and most recently, a video editor for
the Dept. of National Defence. From his debut screening in Ottawa – which won
him 1st place at SAW Videos ‘REMIX’ competition in 2002 - to his present
international video screenings, numerous awards and grants,
controversial ‘money-shredding’ artwork and experimental performances - this
emerging artist has been unleashing a fury of Art about our most compelling
and historic times. Visit his website to watch free videos, or view his
gallery of artworks, and don't miss his candid/quirky interview
with ‘Guerilla.ca’. <http://www.adornato.com>

MARC LEBLANC, musician and sound artist, recently moved to Ottawa
from Fredericton, New Brunswick where he played in jazz and experimental
music ensembles. He designs sound art installations and is a founding member
of improvised music collective Furnacehour. His enthusiasm and keen ability to
play air guitar cannot cure cancer but one magical student amateur night, it
almost got him kicked out of high school. He considers it the high water mark
of his musical career.

MAX MIDDLE has been playing music, vocalizing and writing in Ottawa, Canada
for the past few months. When not in Ottawa, he enjoys touring the garden with
his resident gnome. He is not easily charmed but loves magic. He enjoys
swimming, watching snails gallop, eating green vegetables, sleeping and
dreaming. He has recently been conducting investigations into sound poetry and
improvised music with some very talented collaborators. You might have seen
him perform during the Ottawa Fringe Festival. He hopes to soon be able to
update his web site with all kinds of audio and video files <www.maxmiddle.com>

JASON SONIER: ja has been involved in music for most of his life, from choirs
in
elementary school, to studying music and performance at Carleton University,
learning flute, bass, guitar and audio engineering on the way.  He learned
hand-percussion from several West African drummers at the Stone Angel
Institute and from other teachers elsewhere as well. He learned Irish whistle,
Irish flute and bodhran over the course of several years of study conducted
through the Irish cultural organization, Ceoltas Ceoltairi Eirin. He has
played these Irish instruments at various traditional sessions about town.  He
spent several years training and working as an audio engineer for both event
and studio production. He has recorded and performed with the Euphoria Blues
Band, Pangur Ban, the Grasshoppa Dance Exchange, the voice-and-percussion
improvisation group Oya, the percussion-based Dejaske Trio and with stage
bands for productions of the Rocky Horror Show and Tommy. He is currently
focusing on his solo projects: summersolstice, black willow and sublingua. He
now plays anything he can get his hands on (he's working on harp, cello and
lapsteel), performs his own music and collaborates with modern dancers.
Sometimes, he sleeps.

MIKE WHITE has been experimenting with acoustics and electronics ever since
discovering his first Casiotone in 1984. While residing in Nashville, TN, he
earned a Bachelor's degree in Music Business (maj. Production), gained
significant studio experience as a session drummer and recording engineer, and
produced a self-engineered CD of electronic/hard core/thrash. He is now fully
engaged with the emergence of his label, ALPHAOMEGA X., which carries
his 'iron core' band AZED and his electronic-art project "alphaomega vort x."
The latter has just released his first DVD of Audio-Visual music entitled "The
War Story - 02-11-01". To pay the bills he produces video as well as audio
tracks for video games. Clients include Coors Light, Megabloks.
<www.alphaomegax.com> will be up by Sept 30.

DAVID WILKINSON has been playing music for a very long time: pots and pans,
garage, basement, Humber, Carleton University Bachelor of Music, jazz and
classical guitar, composition, computer music, audio recording, band after
band after band…Now, with queer raw emotion he approaches his art as freely as
possible and with sci-fi intelligence!

Yup, the point was the way Derrida is seen as French.

The discussion, airing, wrangles etc, on this list have of course followed on, been prompted by, the fact of, the event of, his
death, but for the most part, notwithstanding his being Algerian, his being a Jew, he is seen, pro and contra, as 'French' and
thereby invoking, raising the spirits, of whole sets of values like:

French=intellectual, pertaining to the general, sophisticated, clever, non-Anglo, possibly unhygienic, not a devotee of gridiron
(all these are good points)

and

French=intellectual, pertaining to the general, sophisticated, clever, non-Anglo, possibly unhygienic, not a devotee of gridiron
(all these are bad points)

I'm not trying to suggest that any listee actually reproduces either of these sets of caricature, rather trying to say, I hope
clearly, that there is a certain ambience, a 'feel', to the debate that swings around these poles.

All the Best

"One thing I notice is the way Derrida is seen as 'French'".

and not:

"Derrida's departure to other shores and tenures is the way Derrida is seen
as 'French'".

But then, every sentence contains the seeds of its opposite.

I wondered about that, but then how is it that "death" is the way he is
seen as French????

It's not important who wins poetry awards, just that
no one taking risks as a poet does (unless he's past
70, like Jackson Mac Low was).

Yeah -- I'm pretty much with Dave on this -- My original point (lost in my
temporary collapse of ability to read suspended clauses etc.) was that
Derrida's life should trouble any visions of "French" as a homogeneous
category even prior to his philosophical troubling of such categories --
not that his life forms a "ground" for reading his texts -- but the texts
themselves touch upon this -- especialy the great MONOLIGUALISM OF THE
OTHER and the Derrida part of the Derrida/Bennington collaboration volume --

Definitions of The Yad vary, for some it is written on car-number-plates in cryptic
scripts and in the spaces between invisible hyphens, for others it the sudden scroll
unscrolling scrawl of an atrophied sense, like that of smell, for instance, which as is
well-known is a reduced faculty in humans, and often confused with precognition,
unlike the case of our cousins gorilla gorilla or pan troglodytes, despite the products
and marketing of ICI and Chanel et al. It can be

very silly, like that joke we both know, for indeed, as is said, in much wisdom lies
much folly, and verser-vicer. Etcetera, ta-rum. It can be plangent, plaintive, like that
tune we all know by Bach (yes, that one, the one that makes us sad to be happy, happy
to be sad) or one can find it in reflection, beyond the mirror's morning call, on, say,
that in Mumbai or Calcutta the homeless have to pay to sleep on the night-streets,
protection rackets run pavement space (and we think we're hard done by, eh?) or it
can be Crashaw calling Love, thou art absolute sole or

something otherwise again. Like that bend in the road, yes, the lane's curve, where the
accidents never happen. Or maybe do. The way that water writes. The flow. The

hi all, i'm making another shawl sort of like the one visible at
http://www.sheilashawl.umn.edu/shawls-Ebay-02.html (scroll down to
"Flower Sunset", click on images to see in greater detail).  This is
to be auctioned off to benefit Poets in Need.  Two other similar
shawls have been bought by poets from this and the wompo list,
benefiting Poets in Need and/or Silent Witness Initiative (Sheila
Wellstone's favorite charity, a domestic homicide awareness and
prevention program).  Contact me to bid.  The "sell-now" price is
$200.

Also if you have poetic charities you want items for for silent
auctions, let me know. If i've got enough advance notice i'll try to
make a shawl or scarf for the event.  They tend to be textual types
of garments. mIEKAL aND, susan firgils park, chris funkhouser and
petra backonja can let you know about recipient satisfaction.

I think you should keep the honeymoon under 20 seconds.

On a side note about performance marriages, Elizabeth Was & myself got
married legally as part of a performance art festival.  The way we set
it up, we would get married if they accepted our proposal & if not, no
marriage.  It did get accepted, people had to pay $5 to see our
wedding.  We had a 4 piece male chorus, the music was provided by a
naked woman playing mixing bowls tuned with water, the best person was
a woman who had a costume that was half-tuxedo & half gown.  We entered
the performance in giant paper mache sarcophagi that we "broke out of".
  We were married by a court commissioner who wore a kimono & a kabuki
mask & sat in a rocking chair reading the New York Times when he wasn't
performing his duties.  Elizabeth's mother wept in all the appropriate
places.  We called the performance NY Wedding.

blessings on your "journey"

Dean Young's second book, Beloved Infidel, is now back in print as I
mentioned a few weeks ago.  www.hollyridgepress.com for information and sales.

Hollyridge is slowly moving toward realizing part of its mission: to bring
back into print out of print poetry and literary fiction.

Close reading of the following  will not provide comfort or, as some might
say, so much for "Privacy".  This piece is from Sports Illustrated:

"Tiger Woods and new bride Elin Nordegren were briefly detained aboard their
yacht Privacy on Thursday, and then were turned away from port in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, because they had failed to notify authorities of their arrival.
New security provisions require many boats to submit an arrival notice at
least four days before entering a U.S. port, which includes Puerto Rico. The
yacht originally aroused suspicion by blasting Cat Stevens' Wild World."

>> soldiers returning from combat. It will also publish an
>> anthology which, according to their website, will be
>> 'open to active US military personnel and their

>> bookstores and will be distributed free by the Arts
>> Endowment to military installations, schools, and

>> The project is being carried out in cooperation with the

>> Arts Federation, and has been funded ($250,000 of its
>> $300,000 cost) by the Boeing Company, one of the US's

>> letters to a GI-contains the photos, bios, and book
>> covers of thirteen well-published authors of fiction and
>> poetry (some veterans of earlier wars, some from

>> Bruce Weigl, a Bronze Star veteran of the Vietnam war,

>>
>>    To expect young men and women who are just returned

>>    and had done to them unspeakable things is to ask
>>    far too much of them. . . . As returning veterans,
>>    they are far too close to the war to trust their own
>>    immediate responses; they all need to come to terms
>>    with what they've been through and what they've
>>    seen, and then they'll be ready to tell the stories
>>    that no one wants to hear.
>>
>> What is it like for a returning veteran to write under
>> the aegis of the military, where language necessarily
>> serves a far different purpose than it does for the
>> poet? Jan Barry, also a poet and decorated Vietnam
>> veteran, tells of his experience:
>>
>>    In 1964 I was appointed to West Point from the ranks
>>    after serving ten months in Vietnam. I was invited
>>    by upperclassmen at the military academy to write
>>    about my experiences for a student publication. I
>>    found it impossible to do. The whole mood at West
>>    Point was akin to a football team preparing for a
>>    big game against a rival team. I was stumped as to
>>    how to write, in that atmosphere, a serious
>>    reflection on life in a war zone of our own making.
>>    To find the space I needed to write more critically,
>>    I resigned from West Point and an intended military
>>    career. When I submitted my resignation, a kindly
>>    colonel called me into his office and told me a
>>    story about his brother, who had also wanted to be a
>>    writer and grew up in a military family. His father,
>>    a general, ordered the brother to stay in the
>>    military and write. 'You can stay in the Army and
>>    write official histories,' the colonel said
>>    enthusiastically. He could not conceive of the
>>    critical perspective I had acquired in Vietnam, in
>>    which official statements were often wildly
>>    unrelated to the facts in the field.
>>
>> I have pulled from my shelf a slim volume of poems
>> edited by Jan Barry, Larry Rottmann, and Basil T.
>> Parquet in 1972, which was for me a touchstone in those
>> war years, a way inside Vietnam's reality, as it was for
>> many: Winning Hearts and Minds: War Poems by Vietnam
>> Veterans. It was a grassroots veterans volume, put
>> together on Barry's kitchen table, dedicated to the
>> children of Indochina, and published by 1st Casualty
>> Press, named from the famous quote by Aeschylus in the
>> fifth century b.c.: 'In war, truth is the first
>> casualty.'
>>
>> '[O]ne wonders at the shape of this generation's
>> returning war narratives,' says Kevin Bowen, also a poet
>> and Vietnam veteran, and Director of the William Joiner
>> Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at
>> the University of Massachusetts, which has offered
>> writing workshops to veterans since 1987. 'Will this war
>> have its own Winning Hearts and Minds? Perhaps not, if
>> Washington has its say.' In his protest against
>> Operation Homecoming (which, by the way, borrows its
>> name from the repatriation of American POWs at the end
>> of the Vietnam war), he writes in the veterans online
>> magazine Intervention: 'Beyond the language of self-help
>> and therapeutic' aspects of writing, beyond the back-
>> patting, it is not difficult to see in the project an
>> effort to establish an official canon of writing from
>> the century's first wars, neatly packaged, ready for
>> mass distribution and classroom use.'
>>
>> What's the rush here? Why doesn't the NEA help send
>> discharged veterans to colleges and bona fide writing
>> programs, investing public arts money to support their
>> writing in educational settings, where, as Bowen says,
>> 'it will be fostered over time and not immediately co-
>> opted.' And give them the chance to develop some
>> historical insight, and to contextualize experience in
>> more than the blinding exigencies of the moment?
>>
>> Indeed, this project appears to be an attempt to preempt
>> the immediate (and even archival) record of this war by
>> its combatants. It is well to remember here that the NEA
>> is an arm of the government, its chairman and board
>> political appointments by the administration. In the
>> Guardian (April 20, 2004), Dana Gioia was quoted as
>> saying: 'I have noticed a lot of similarities between
>> the military world and the literary world. Both are
>> highly specialized and highly professionalized. And when
>> that happens, you tend not to see a lot outside your
>> immediate world.' Perhaps Gioia was counting on this,
>> thinking that other poets, less canny than he, and lost
>> in a doze at the shuttered windows of their ivory
>> towers, wouldn't notice the political ramifications of
>> this project. And though he mentions in his eerily
>> cheerful introduction every great epic of war from the
>> Iliad to War and Peace (works written long after the
>> events), we might question whether it is literature that
>> can be produced or even encouraged under such
>> circumstances.
>>
>> In that same glossy, glamorous booklet, each writer's
>> page features a brief, enlarged, bold-face quotation
>> from one of his or her books. It doesn't matter what the
>> name of the author is since the following quote is
>> lifted out of context and therefore from the frame of
>> its meaning in the original narrative, and so can only
>> be construed in its effect as a sound-bite in the
>> context of Operation Homecoming. Here is the very first
>> quotation:
>>
>>    He left a pause. He might have been considering
>>    telling her everything about himself. Then he said,
>>    'Like most military people, I hate war. But there
>>    are tigers in the world, you know.'
>>
>> The effect and purpose of these words in this context
>> goes without saying. What does require pause is those
>> tigers. When promoting a war, which means authorizing
>> the killing of other human beings, it is necessary to
>> use a language which robs them of their humanity. There
>> are several ways this is done. One is by seeing them as
>> members of another species-something bestial, primitive,
>> predatory. Perhaps that is why most animals do not
>> murder their own kind: they are not subject to this
>> confusion. Another way, which is characteristic of
>> military language, is to denature the enemy by the use
>> of a detached, Latinate, and bloodless language, so that
>> one 'neutralizes' opposing forces, or the burning,
>> mutilation, and killing of civilians is masked as
>> 'collateral damage.'
>>
>> At the same time that the enemy's reality is demonized
>> or neutralized (or both), the actions of one's own side,
>> in military parlance, are redescribed in terms which
>> reverse meaning, disowning the real harm that is being
>> done: the US missions involving massive dropping of
>> incendiary bombs over North Vietnam were called
>> 'Sherwood Forest' and 'Pink Rose.' Poetry, which is
>> above all 'learning to call things by the right name,'
>> has, therefore, goals incommensurate with the use of
>> language by the military in the conduct of war.
>>
>> 'I just want to remember / the dead piled high behind
>> the curtain,' writes the contemporary Palestinian poet
>> Mahmoud Darwish. It is the poet's task, I too believe,
>> to make us feel the full weight of the bodies hidden
>> behind the rhetoric and the falsifying parlance, to
>> embody truth, to remember the dismembered human form.
>> 'For my enemy is dead,' wrote Walt Whitman, 'a man as
>> divine as myself is dead.' 'It is difficult,' William
>> Carlos Williams famously wrote, 'to get the news from
>> poems / yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of
>> what is found there.' And I am taking that miserable

>>
>> Once again we are at war; in the words of Yeats, 'the
>> nightmare / Rides upon sleep.' We stand at what has been
>> called by Lionel Trilling 'the dark and bloody
>> crossroads where literature and politics meet,' not by
>> choice-but by circumstance. As poets, we do not choose
>> our subjects; the imagination is a force which can be
>> invited, but it cannot be commanded. In fact, in those
>> moments when we are poets (and we live many more when we
>> are not), we must live, like Cicero in a poem by Gibbons
>> Ruark, 'in that singular province that was never
>> Caesar's.'
>>
>> Returning at last to the first great war epic of the
>> Western tradition, the Iliad, I remind us all that it is
>> written from both sides, that the eye of the poet moves
>> back and forth between the Greek camp and the city of
>> Troy. There is no enemy: simply the ambition of
>> Agamemnon, the lust of Paris, the wrath of Achilles, the
>> laughter of the gods, the tragedy of war in which are
>> 'hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong
>> souls / of heroes.' The city of Troy is put to the
>> torch, its women and children enslaved, and the epic
>> ends, as all wars end, with a funeral pyre and a handful
>> of bones.
>>
>> It should be clear from what has been said that it is
>> not the conjunction of poetry and soldiers which is
>> problematic. On the contrary, sustained exposure to
>> poetry might serve as one antidote to the violence and
>> divisive language of war, and become the lifeline it has
>> been for a number of Vietnam combat veterans who
>> survived the postwar years, and whose words helped
>> others to do the same. This project sadly mars this

which he squirts into the reader=B9s cerebral cortex. Speculative Primitive i=
s
a dense world, with lots of turbulance, a slam dance for the brain, a
swerving, careening, spontaneous-feeling poetry, devoid of tidy endings and
tidy beginnings, where metaphors bleed into each other and puns are
scattered like land mines. At times, political, romantic, confounding,
illuminating, overwhelming, frenetic, feisty, philosophical, and funny.
Jeffrey McDaniel

There is urgent immediacy in this book, as well as sweat, and guts, and
tears, and higher education with teeth. Figurative language=8Bwhich
Stroffolino nimbly tries on like seasonal clothes to survive modern
viscissitudes, then just as furiously strips off to get hold of the naked,
shivering truth=8Bserves as a tough-minded medium for striking at the moody,
self-searching core of contemporary life and social relationships. Chris
Stroffolino understands that =B3feeling=B2 is synonymous with =B3paradox,=B2 and
that paradox, with all its attendant pain and joy, is meant to be lived.
Pamela Lu

There is something very physical about the way Chris Stroffolino uses
language. Speculative Primitive, as a whole, is an invigorating walk throug=
h
the sensuality of Stroffolino=B9s though processes. It=B9s part playing at
language and part longing for another way, something other than language, t=
o
express the emotions one feels, not only for other people, but for moments.
This is his best work yet. I only wish I could have said something about hi=
s
relation to music and how you can see it all over these poems.
Pam Rehm

A book in four hundred, Chris Stroffolino=B9s Speculative Primitive is a
flamboyant curtain call for the wordy-earth
sex-digressive-nightmare-people-poetry movement. Left and Right
coast-Brained, it=B9s a work and world in words.
Stephen Malkmus

1. OUR ENORMOUS ELECTION-WIELDING POWER


We have a couple for neighbors on this third floor of our building. Four
years ago, we watched the election returns together - with a few other
people - at our place. We lasted well into the night. I can't go it alone.
I get too depressed. The others pretty much felt the same way. Anyway -
this year we're repeating. So I go next door and the woman hems and haws
and says it might not be a good idea if she and her husband came this
time. It turns it it's because of our KARMA - somehow we're responsible
for the election gone bad. Just so you know - Azure and I - yes - we did
it! From our quiet suburban hovel close to downtown Brooklyn we managed to
fuck up the election. She looked nervous. She really didn't want to talk
about it.

In any case, I replied that I didn't know we had such enormous karma on a
national level - that someone like Satan with that much bad karma would
have to have at least thousand mile wings to make such a difference and I
doubted Satan would pay much attention to us. I mentioned those wings
would cover at least half the United States. I think that was a mistake
because they'd only cover a third. Anyway, she hemmed and hawed again,
indicating she was buying none of it. So Azure went over and talked to her
and she hemmed and hawed and Azure came back extremely upset and that was
that.

She is a BAD PERSON and a BAD DEMOCRAT and I will now aim all my EVIL
KARMA in her direction. And this would be funny if it weren't true. Or it
would be true if it weren't funny, but it's true. Or it wouldn't be funny
if it were true and it is.

We've known these people for years. He's a good artist who drinks too much
late at night. She works does loan administration in the city. I thought
we were on good terms with them. He helps us with building 'stuff' and I
help him with computer 'stuff.' We give each other books. But now I find
out that presumably we've been the ferocious embodiments of evil,
affecting the national election.

Not bad for a night's work four years ago. This time I'll working on
burning down their loft. No wait, it's connected to ours.

Yeah -- I'm pretty much with Dave on this -- My original point (lost in my
temporary collapse of ability to read suspended clauses etc.) was that
Derrida's life should trouble any visions of "French" as a homogeneous
category even prior to his philosophical troubling of such categories --
not that his life forms a "ground" for reading his texts -- but the texts
themselves touch upon this -- and the Derrida part of the Derrida/Bennington collaboration volume --

Despite $4 Billion In Bribes And Quid Pro Quos, U.S. Observers Privately
Cautious About Afghan Election:
A Better World For Afghanistan Under The Yolk Of Capitalism:
"Wait'll We Tell 'Em We Ain't Got $4 Billion Dollars."
By HUMFRY DUMPHRY


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

good day,

here is a tip for accessing newspaper sites that require registration. The
folks at the Canadian lit-site Bookninja have taken the trouble to
register on many sites so that their readers can read stories from major
dailies that they link to hassle-free.

from their site:
* This site requires registration - login: bookninja, password: waaaa
(some sites require six character passwords - for these sites the password
is: waaaaa).

NYT is one of many that they have taken the time to register as a public
service to lazy folks like me.

good luck.

and as long as we're mentioning Greg Easterbrook's nfl column, a year ago he
was fired from writing the same column for espn.com for the following
anti-semitic remarks that appeared in his new republic blog:

"Disney's CEO, Michael Eisner, is Jewish; the chief of Miramax, Harvey
Weinstein, is Jewish. Yes, there are plenty of Christian and other Hollywood
executives who worship money above all else, promoting for profit the
adulation of violence. Does that make it right for Jewish executives to
worship money above all else, by promoting for profit the adulation of
violence? Recent European history alone ought to cause Jewish executives to
experience second thoughts about glorifying the killing of the helpless as a
fun lifestyle choice."

Congrats!  We got married on the Day of the Dead last year.  Here is a
Sappho poem my Mom read:


Come and sing, all of you, converse, for we are attending a wedding.
Speak this joy when
hearing love's clear song.

How beautiful the bride, her locks of hair.
The bride was once a child.
There was no child like this one.
Let's sing!  Today she has put aside her lyre.

Bridegroom, you look graceful.
Your eyes are gentle.
Love pours over your face.
What would I compare to you
other than an apple tree, where

all alone a sweet apple reddens on the topmost branch.
The apple pickers did not notice it, yet they did not forget it.
They could not reach it.

I sing of the sweetest things for you and the bride.

Guard each other.
Your marriage has been
achieved.

A bowl of ambrosia has been mixed.
We all offer libations and altogether wish for good things
for the wedding couple.


All best,
Catherine Daly

I think you should keep the honeymoon under 20 seconds.

On a side note about performance marriages, Elizabeth Was & myself got
married legally as part of a performance art festival.  The way we set
it up, we would get married if they accepted our proposal & if not, no
marriage.  It did get accepted, people had to pay $5 to see our
wedding.  We had a 4 piece male chorus, the music was provided by a
naked woman playing mixing bowls tuned with water, the best person was
a woman who had a costume that was half-tuxedo & half gown.  We entered
the performance in giant paper mache sarcophagi that we "broke out of".
  We were married by a court commissioner who wore a kimono & a kabuki
mask & sat in a rocking chair reading the New York Times when he wasn't
performing his duties.  Elizabeth's mother wept in all the appropriate
places.  We called the performance NY Wedding.

blessings on your "journey"

Today my riotous concentration broke

Into a slump. Today my vinegar goes bad.

Today I photographed the _credit mobilier_;

I put out fresh flowers for the workers,

With a light hearted note reading

*We R too bore-jwah 4 luv lol!*

Yesterday I kissed your forehead when we were alone.

Today I wished you could have seen me when I exploded

Into bankruptcy because here I am both woman and

ACTUALLY EXISTING Thelonious Monk.




Today I shot myself in the skunk. On the Security

Council I have the power of 200 million Hindus.

Today in comparative history I died:

And a prudent wife is from the LORD. I plumb

Unsuspecting faucets. It’s disgusting.

I wouldn’t know my foot. My manifest

Contempt for profiteers and schemers explains

Why I’m both woman and ACTUALLY EXISTING

drunk.




Today I burnt incense and hated the hippies. You would


Too if you were educated like me. I am Bradley, thy
third

Born, eat of my venison. Today I conceded Classicism

And Romanticism for blood; all this in order to
colonize

Ancestors I don’t have. What a confession! Neither
shortened

That I cannot save nor heavy that I can’t hear,

Today I will spring up occasionally. Today inhabits

Tomorrow’s queer nutshell. And I both woman and

David Cronenberg’s ACTUALLY EXISTING oeuvre.




Today I lied, calling in sick when merely depressed

And needing to write. Just one more time. Robbing

And stealing is to my mind as grammar to

Gertrude Stein. Today I offended sensibility

In my head and my ex-girlfriend visited. We swap

Insanities for charisma and kill a spoonful of both.

She says, “you are ACTUALLY EXISTING death.”




Last week I upped my intake of Zoloft by 10mg

A day and proceeded to pick the dead leaves off the

Plants I hadn’t been watering. This is my definition
of

R. D. Laing. My father fought depression with the
Bible

And I read Marx. Salut revolution! The fatter the
book, the

More authors, I say. And one day I will publish

An ACTUALLY EXISTING chapbook.




Today I showered with my clothes on and my

Girlfriend because she was raped by her father.

This is essentially romantic. Why are we poor!

Yesterday we talked for hours and I fucked her trust.

Today I refused that ordeal and we broke up. Oh world!

Today I put down bloodshed with madness and

ACTUALLY EXISTING despair.




Today I experienced again no urgency. Today my

Lover’s insanity bears no reflection and nothing,

not even her skin, tastes like her. Today my other

tooth fell out and the children laughed. I forced
indie-rock

On my grandmother and she died the next day. Godspeed

Said Steve Albini, she was an ACTUALLY EXISTING

cunthole anyway.

LAST.POETS.BIOGRAPHY

Last Poets were rappers of the civil rights era. Along with the changing
domestic landscape came the New York City-hip group called The Last
Poets, who used obstreperous verse to chide a nation whose inclination
was to maintain the colonial yoke around the neck of the
disenfranchised.

Shortly after the death of Martin Luther King, The Last Poets were born.
David Nelson, Gylan Kain, and Abiodun Oyewole, were born on the
anniversary of Malcolm X's birthday May 19, 1968 in Marcus Garvey Park.
They grew from three poets and a drummer to seven young black and
Hispanic artists: David Nelson, Gylan Kain, Abiodun Oyewole, Felipe
Luciano, Umar Bin Hassan, Jalal Nurridin, and Suliamn El Hadi (Gil Scott
Heron was never a member of the group). They took their name from a poem
by South African poet Willie Kgositsile, who posited the necessity of
putting aside poetry in the face of looming revolution.

"When the moment hatches in time's womb there will be no art talk," he
wrote. "The only poem you will hear will be the spearpoint pivoted in
the punctured marrow of the villain....Therefore we are the last poets
of the world."

The Theory of Everything, R.I.P.
By EMILY EAKIN

Published: October 17, 2004

WITH the death on Oct. 8 of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida,
the era of big theory came quietly to a close.

He had been among the last of a generation of thinkers, mostly male
and invariably French, whose sweeping claims about the nature of
language, existence and reality transfixed scholars on both sides of
the Atlantic and, for several decades, beginning in the 1960's,
turned humanities departments into hotbeds of productivity and debate.

Mr. Derrida outlived fellow theorists Louis Althusser, Roland
Barthes, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and Gilles
Deleuze, but signs of theory's waning influence had been accumulating
around him for years. Since the early 1990's, the grand intellectual
paradigms with which these men were prominently associated - Marxism,
psychoanalysis, structuralism - had steadily lost adherents and
prestige.

The world had changed but not necessarily in the ways some of big
theory's fervent champions had hoped. Ideas once greeted as potential
catalysts for revolution began to seem banal, irrelevant or simply
inadequate to the task of achieving social change.

Deconstruction, Mr. Derrida's primary legacy, was no exception.
Originally a method of rigorous textual analysis intended to show
that no piece of writing is exactly what it seems, but rather laden
with ambiguities and contradictions, deconstruction found ready
acolytes across the humanities and beyond - including many determined
to deconstruct not just text but the political system and society at
large.

Today, the term has become a more or less meaningless artifact of
popular culture, more likely to turn up in a description of an
untailored suit in the pages of Vogue than in a graduate seminar on
James Joyce.

But even as theory, or at least its distinctive vocabulary, was
seeping into everyday life, some scholars were renouncing it, as
=46rank Lentricchia, an English professor at Duke University, did in a
1996 essay in Lingua Franca magazine. Theory, he argued, had all but
supplanted literature in English departments, reducing the literary
canon to a litany of political and social wrongs, "a cesspool," as he
put it, "of racism, poverty, sexism, homophobia and imperialism."
Other scholars quietly abandoned big theory - writing at its most
general and abstract - for more personal projects, producing memoirs
and even novels.

A 2003 symposium on the future of theory hosted by the editors of
Critical Inquiry, an academic journal, captured the bleak mood. When
a student in the audience asked the panelists, more than two dozen
distinguished scholars, what theory was good for, the answer came
back amid much hand-wringing over the Bush administration and the war
in Iraq: very little.

That same year, the British professor Terry Eagleton, who made his
name as a Marxist literary critic, published "After Theory," in which
he declared: "We are living now in the aftermath of what one might
call high theory, in an age which, having grown rich on the insights
of thinkers like Althusser, Barthes and Derrida, has also in some
ways moved beyond them."

Why did big theories flourish, and why are they now in retreat? The
most likely explanation involves politics. In this view, the rise and
fall of theory paralleled the changing fortunes of the left. "The
fate of major theories was very much bound up with a political
moment," Mr. Eagleton said in a telephone interview. "The heroic
period for that theory was the 1960's to the 1980's, a period in
which the left was on the up." More than simply tools for analyzing
literary or philosophical texts, theory was seen as a political
weapon with which to challenge the status quo. As the English
professor Stanley Fish put it in a telephone interview: "There was a
general desire for there to be a political payoff for theoretical
formulations. The hope was to revolutionize the world."

In the case of deconstruction, the idea that hidden power hierarchies
and agendas could be exposed through careful close readings had
tremendous political appeal. Analyzing Mr. Derrida's rise to stardom
in a 1987 article, "How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher: The
Case of Jacques Derrida," Mich=E8le Lamont, a sociologist at Harvard,
argued that among other things he "provided just the theoretical
position that met and matched the political climate."

Then the political climate changed, and big theory's fate was sealed.
The Berlin Wall came down, and the Soviet Union collapsed. Advances
in neuroscience upended Freudian assumptions about the brain, and
psychoactive drugs replaced psychoanalysis. And for the most part the
social revolutions that big theory had seemed to portend did not take
place.

Today, humanities departments are quieter places than they were when
Mr. Derrida's ideas first caught on. The insights - especially the
powerful idea that language is not a transparent medium for
representing reality but rather a cultural system that shapes our
values and beliefs - are here to stay. But these days, few scholars
are producing discipline-transcending, paradigm-breaking new work.

The emphasis has shifted to what Ms. Lamont in a telephone interview
called "finely grained, empirical research." She added, "There are
not many huge theorists to be hired out there."

But that may not be such a bad thing after all. In retrospect, Mr.
=46ish said, it was a mistake to believe that theory could change the
world.

"Once theoretical questions cease to be questions in the realm of
philosophy and become questions about how to live our lives, that
places a great burden on theory," he said. "No theory can make good
on that promise. It's the difference between the claims one can
legitimately make and the claims that one probably should not make
for theory. On the one hand you can say, as a theorist, 'Follow me,
and I will show you an answer to an important, vexing and
longstanding question.' Or you can say, 'Follow me, and I will lead
you to the promised land.'

''The first is, of course, the appropriate claim and necessary claim
made by scholars and theorists. The second is the language of
prophets or even of gods. And theorists, thankfully, are neither
prophets nor gods."

The "Days of Penitence":
Gaza Sinks in a Sea of Blood
by Mohammed Omer: www.rafahtoday.org

It smells unbelievably bad here.  To walk down any
street?if you dare to?you skirt, or sometimes unavoidably
walk through, pools of blood.  There are shreds of human
flesh?some of them unrecognizable as human remains?all
over, on rooftops,  plastered to broken windows, on the
street.  The stench of rotting blood mixes with the more
acrid odor of flesh burnt to black char by the rockets
fired by the Israeli Army's American-made Apache
helicopters.

The sky is full of black smoke, some from the rocket
explosions, but even more, it sometimes seems, from the
endless fires of tires and other debris that people keep
stoking.  The smoke confuses the heat-seeking unmanned
drone surveillance planes, so setting fires in any
relatively open area may draw fire and let a bomb explode
somewhat harmlessly.

All this smoke mixed with plaster and cement dust is a
blessing and a curse.  The stench of burning flesh and
rotting blood masks to some extent the smell of raw sewage
from broken sewer pipes and the tens of thousands of bodies
unwashed for over a week now.  Water to drink is a rare and
precious commodity here?baths and showers have become
impossible luxuries.

Your eyes inevitably tear up from all the smoke?but then,
that protects you a tiny bit from some of the more
harrowing sights?recognizable body parts?a piece of a leg,
an obvious part of a torso, and fingers?more scattered,
individual, recognizable fingers than anyone should ever
have to see.  Volunteer crews are gathering these human
fragments and bringing them to Jabalya's two hospitals but
the ambulances cannot possibly keep up with the flood of
newly dead and injured.

Funeral processions are everywhere, and "houses of
mourning"?the tents bereaved families set up in which to
receive their families and friends.  In fact, though, every
house here, those relatively intact and those partly or
wholly destroyed by the IDF tanks and bulldozers, is a
house of mourning.

And nothing protects you from the sounds?the tears and
laments of the mothers and fathers, husbands, wives and
children of the dead, the screams of the injured, the wail
of ambulance sirens, sniper fire, the thud of tank shells
and the too-frequent explosions as another Apache shell
lands.

Time is distorted here?hours feel like days, days like
weeks or months.  This is Jabalya Refugee Camp in the
Northern Gaza Strip, one of the most crowded places on
earth where 106,000 men, women, and children, the
overwhelming majority of them unarmed civilians, have been
under an all-out attack for over a week now.

Israel's official position is that this carnage is a
"response" to Palestinian militants' firing a homemade
Qassam rocket into the Israeli town of Sderot last week, a
rocket which killed two children.  In fact, though, the
first tanks rumbled into Jabalya some hours before the
rocket attack on Sderot, and we had all been watching with
alarm as the Israeli forces multiplied in northern Gaza
over the last few weeks?2000 fresh troops, over a hundred
more tanks and bulldozers.


It is only when I sit down to write up my notes made here
in the last few days that the cruelty of the IDF name for
this attack?"Days of Penitence"?hits me.  They are not just
slaughtering unarmed civilians, but language itself.
"Penitence," as I understand it, is voluntary remorse for
wrong-doing.  Is this massacre supposed to induce remorse
in its victims?  Are they supposed to mourn the deaths of
four or five Israeli soldiers, and two Israeli children and
accept the death of more than 60 Palestinian civilians as
some kind of justice?  To those of us trapped in Jabalya,
it seems like Days of Revenge.  It is unquestionably
collective punishment, and illegal under the Geneva
Conventions.

Perhaps we should not be surprised.  Israel's Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon has announced this attack will last
"as long as necessary," that is, until there is "no further
danger" from the Palestinian resistance's homemade rockets.
Sharon, of course, engineered the massacres of Sabra and
Shatila over twenty years ago.  Now, he is doing much the
same, but with vastly improved weaponry.

Of course, the militant factions exist, and have been
striking here and there during this last week but they are
vastly outnumbered, not to mention out-gunned, by the
Israelis.  Hamas, on its side, has distributed leaflets in
Gaza City vowing to continue the rocket attacks on the
illegal Israeli settlements in Gaza and any Israeli towns
and cities their home-made ordnance can reach as long as
the Israeli incursions continue.

International protests have been muted, and stymied by
United States support for Israel.  The lone, feeble voice
from the US State Department urged Israel to keep its
"response" "proportional"?after, of course, the obligatory
mantra, "Israel has a right to defend itself."  A strongly
worded resolution condemning the attack brought before the
UN at the beginning of the week was defeated by the US
veto.

It is hard to maintain accurate casualty figures?the most
recent count seems to be 80 Palestinians killed (20 of them
militants claimed by Hamas) and over 200 injured.
Unquestionably, by the time this is printed, the figures
will be higher.

There is no refuge anywhere in Jabalya.  The hospitals are
chaotic, supplies are short and all medical personnel have
been working around the clock for days now.

I saw Abu Nedal, the father of Nedal Al Madhown a 14
year-old boy, struggle to maintain his composure as he
asked the exhausted doctors and ambulance drivers, "Was my
son killed?  Has he been killed?"  (In fact, the boy was
dead on arrival..)  The majority of the dead and injured
have been teens and children, obvious non-combatants.

I interviewed Dr. Mahmoud Al Asali, the director of Kamal
Adwan Hospital, who told me he was forced to assume the
Israeli Army has been deliberately targeting civilians.  He
said most of those injured by gunfire were wounded in the
upper parts of their bodies, indicating the Israeli
sharpshooters must have orders to shoot to kill.
Palestinian doctors have removed many flechettes from the
dead and injured, indicating the IDF are using illegal
fragmentation bombs.  These release razor sharp flechettes
as they explode.  Dr. Al Asali says these illegal
fragmentation devices greatly increase the number of deaths
and the number and severity of injuries.  The IDF has
refused to comment on this.

The hospital staffs and ambulance crews are so overextended
that they are using volunteers for the gruesome task of
collecting, sorting, and attempting to match scattered
human remains to return as much as possible to bereaved
families.  One of these medical workers, Ahmed Abu Saall
26,  from Kamal Aswan Hospital, told me, "One enormous
difficulty we face is that these powerful bombs can scatter
the parts of a single victim over a wide area.  It is quite
possible parts of a person could end up in Al Awda hospital
in the east of the camp, while other parts of the same
person end up with us here on the western side."  Sometimes
shreds of clothing can help with the matching.

The Israeli Army has frequently shot at the medical teams
and journalists.  So far, two ambulance drivers have been
injured, and a cameraman from Ramatan News Agency has been
hurt.  Of course, the ambulance crews and press all wear
identifying gear.

Israel has closed all borders into Gaza and has severely
restricted all movement within the Gaza Strip.  There are
three major "zones" split off by sealed military
checkpoints, but recent days have seen numerous new
checkpoints, and roads closed by cement block and sand
obstructions.  People cannot  move between cities, not even
ambulances bringing patients to hospitals.  Moreover, the
main Israel-Gaza crossing is closed, even to international
NGOs, humanitarian relief groups, and foreign journalists.

Intense as the military attack has been, and continues to
be, it is certainly not the only danger to the people here.
Many families now have been without food and water for
days.  In Tal Al Zattar, the eastern part of Jabalya, I
interviewed Umm Ramzi, an elderly lady who spoke to me
through the gaping hole a tank shell had left in her house.
"We have been appealing to the Red Cross, to save our lives
and the lives of our children, but nobody has responded."

Most of  the NGO workers and relief organizations
have?logically enough?assumed they cannot get through the
Israeli military lines that completely surround Jabalya,
although they are well aware that the civilians need help.
I managed to reach the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), spokesman Simon Schorno by phone and he told
me:  "I'm in my way to Gaza now.  We have been talking to
the IDF to get permission to bring food and water, but we
were not able to get an OK for complete food distribution".


Concerning the absence of the Red Cross in the past few
days when many families were in urgent need, Mr. Schorno
said, "I feel terrible.  We are trying to do our best to
get food and water inside, but the damaged streets also
delay us from reaching the people."

A number of eyewitnesses among the camp residents told me
the Israeli Army has commandeered several high buildings as
sniper posts and basically shoot anything that moves.  One
of the most recent victims was Islam Dweidar, 14, who took
a chance during an apparent lull in firing to buy bread for
her mother.  However, she was shot in the head by an
Israeli sniper.

In the Southern part of  the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Army
has increased the number of  tanks and bulldozers in all
parts of Khan Younis and Rafah.  There has been shelling
every night, with many injured and killed. This morning, I
spoke by phone to  Dr. Ali Mussa, director of Abu Yousif Al
Najjar Hospital in Rafah who  announced that 13-year-old
Eman al Hums had been killed by Israeli sniper fire.  He
said, "the child arrived at the hospital after being
riddled by twenty bullets in different parts of her body,
five of them in her head."

Palestinian eyewitnesses reported that Al Hums was killed
while on her way to school with two other schoolgirls. In
early media reports, the IDF said she was planting a bomb;
they later were forced to admit the accusation was false.

These current attacks are now far worse than the so-called
"Operation Rainbow" of last May, which killed 40 in Rafah
and prompted an international outcry.  Now, the silence
from America, in particular, seems to condone this turning
the Gaza Strip into a killing field.  Sharon has picked his
moment well, when America is preoccupied with its
presidential campaign and its invasion of Iraq, to decimate
the children of Gaza.  How many more must die before the
world speaks out?

Here the Israeli gun machines pass: Devastation in Jabalya Refugee Camp

In less than ten hours, a massive IDF incursion on the night of Thursday the
14th into dawn on Friday killed three civilians, left many more injured,
destroyed completely or damaged into uselessness about 48 houses, and did
serious damage to infrastructure. With that many houses uninhabitable, now
hundreds of men, women, and children have become homeless. Rafah governorate
has said about 300 citizens joined the thousands already homeless here in
ten hours last night.

From the medical staff at Abu Youif Al Najjar Hospital in Rafah,I learned
that Ismail Sawalha, a man of 70, Ali Sha'at, 25, and Ahmed Al Tahrawi, 21,
were killed in the incursion. Hospital personnel said that the bodies of the
two young men arrived at the hospital in burned fragments and initially,
identification was difficult. It was only neighborhood eyewitnesses who
later told the hospital that
the bodies of the two men were burned in the crater made by the Apache-fired
missile.

Ahmed Al Sawalha, the 36-year-old son of Ismail, saw his 70-year-old father
killed. "My father was sitting at the stair of our house when he was
killed," he said. "There were no gunmen or fighters in the street. There was
no need to shoot at him."

Also, I was told by eyewitnesses that Jihad Barhoom, 16 years old , was shot
while standing outside his home a few hours before the full incursion
started At least four people were badly injured, including an elderly lady,
Khadra Shoman.

As usual, the Israeli army rolled into the three neighborhoods with tens of
tanks and bulldozers, covered by two Apache helicopters and other
surveillance planes.

Some of the early wire service stories have said 30 houses were reduced to
rubble. I am getting the estimate of 48 houses from talking to eyewitnesses
in the neighborhoods that suffered this incursion, namely, Yebna Camp, Al
Shao'ut, and the Al Barahmah district. I tend to trust that number because
only someone who actually lives in the area can walk around and know for
sure whether a given
stretch of rubble had the day before been one, two, three, or more homes.

As usual, water, electric, and sewer lines suffered serious damage. Some of
these had been repaired since May's "Operation Rainbow," and are now wrecked
again. Also, as usual, streets have been torn up and fruit trees razed.
Everywhere you walk in Rafah, you can see the damage caused by incursion
after incursion. It is almost impossible to find any building that does not
have its collection of
bullet and shell damage.


From Gaza City:


According to Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, Sharon is "considering
withdrawing"to the 'outskirts' over the weekend.

Khalil Samara, the mayor of Jabalya, said this about the announcement:
"Sharon is committing his largest, bloodiest massacres under the guise of
'withdrawing' from the Palestinian camps."

This IDF operation, called "Days of Penitence" is the Israeli "response" to
a Qassam rocket launched by Palestinian militants at the Israeli town of
Sderot close to the Gaza/Israeli border. That attack late in September
killed 2 Israeli children. "Response" seems the wrong word for what is now
happening in all of Gaza. It is collective punishment, and illegal under
international law.

---------------------------------

12 October 04









The Israeli Occupation soldiers gave Oraiba district in Rafah 30 minutes to
to leave their houses before the bulldozers started demolishing them.
?Louder speakers are calling us to leave or they will shoot us? said one of
the eyewitnesses over phone in Rafah while running trying to get his
important documents.



Eight houses were completely and partially demolished in that incursion, in
addition to the damages of the greenhouses, infrastructure, and everything
related to humanity. Oraiba district is well known as an agriculture area.
It is one of the best sources for markets to get into Gaza Strip.



Abu Youif Al Najar hospital reported about many injured people arriving the
hospital everyday due to the daily shelling from tanks and Israel posts.



The Israeli military Forces have been blocking Gaza Strip, dividing it into
three parts for the second week in a row. This has made life very dififcult
for us with lack of food, medicine and even gas for cars to move inside
Rafah.





In Khanyouies also, the IOF Forces shelled Nasser hospital with three tank
shells, leaving at one of the nurses injured, also a 10 year old schoolgirl
was inured while sitting at her school desk in one of the UNRWA schools in
the Camp.



In Jabalya, there are now hundreds of injured and dead..





---------------------------------

6 October 04


Amnah Al Najjar 60 years old is brought in private car
to the hospital after sustaining a head injury by an Israeli sniper. She was
in her house.







Israeli soldiers riddled her body with twenty bullets and another five
ripped through her head on her way to school. Thirteen year old schoolgirl
Eman Al Hums is from Rafah Refugee Camp. She was
shot on her way to school with other two friends. They, however, were
luckier than she was when they ran away as soon as they heard the shelling.

Dr. Ali Mussa at Abu Youif Al Najjar hospital said that the Israeli soldiers
in Rafah shot the child and prevented the medical team from reaching her
body nor bringing her into the hospital.

The Israeli military Forces later on today said that they had not found any
kind of explosives in her school bag. After killing the schoolgirl, one of
the soldiers had said he had believed the bag contained explosives.

From Iman?s blood in Rafah on to Somia Felfel in Jabalya. A tragedy like no
other when Israeli tanks shelled her house leaving all 8 of her children
injured.

The Jabalya Refugee Camp is till under very heavy shelling and hundreds of
victims are arriving at the hospital every hour. The people are appealing to
the Red Cross but they have been unable to respond. A case in point: Umm
Jamal Id, a member of one of the families who are currently surrounded had
been asking for food and water for her children and the Red Cross had not
been able to react at all.

In an interview over phone with the spokesman of Red Cross Simon Schorno, he
said:?I?m on my way to Gaza Strip, but the damaged roads in Gaza Strip is
the reason for the absence of Red Cross over the past few days."

There is heavy resistance in the Jabalya Camp and explosives can be heard
from time to time, inside the camp.

Sixty year old Amnah Al Najjar arrived at the hospital a few hours ago after
sustaining serious head injuries. She was transferred to Al Shifa hospital
due to the lack of beds and medical instruments at Kamal Adwan hospital.

?Al Najjar was shot in her head while she was in her house,? the driver who
brought her body to the hospital said.


Jabalya camp is known as the most heavily populated camp in all of the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank. It is also the first place where the first Intifada
had erupted and where a militant Israeli Jeep drove a group of Palestinians
workers inside the camp.

Israeli soldiers today prevented ambulances and fire engines from reaching
the fire that had erupted in three tons of gas in the North of Gaza Strip.
Black smoke can been seen everywhere in the North of Gaza Strip..

Today it was different from yesterday and the past few days because now
there are so many international journalists who have come into the area to
cover the ongoing carnage, but still the Israeli Forces are not allowing
them to into the camp, and still there are so many of them stuck at the Erez
checkpoint awaiting permission to get into the Gaza Strip.

The refugee families inside the camp are appealing to all free people
throughout the world to stop the blood shedding by the Israeli Occupation
Forces in the camp.


All family members were injured: Soha Felfel 6 year old, on her bed,
after being injured by a tank shell with all her family in the Jabalya Camp




Even kindergartens: Palestinian children are collecting what remains from
the kindergarten that was demolished by the Israeli bulldozers and apaches
shelling










---------------------------------

2 October 04

Writing from the North of Jabalya:








Jabalia is drowning in blood and is now under a new Israeli incursion that's
targeting civilian buildings. There is a smell of death on every street you
go. Life is getting wors in the North of Gaza Strip, soldiers are targeting
everything related to human beings.

Jabalya Camp in the north of Gaza Strip is surrounded here and hundreds of
people were killed and injured.All you can see in the hospital is shreds of
human flesh spread all over the streets..

The Jabalia Camp continues to this moment to be under attack.. ambulance
drivers, medical workers and journalists were the first people to be
targeted by the Israeli Army.



In RAFAH ALSO, AND ACCORDING TO EYEWITNISSES, the IDF invaded the camp,
killing an old man and injuring two others. The situation is deteriorating
throughout..

Most of the dead are children. Kamal Adwan, hospital director said: "The
soldiers are delibderately targeting the upper parts of the children by
rockets and tanks shell."



People here in the North of the Jabalya Camp are in bad need of water and
food, and as usual no international organizations are visiting the area to
provide the families any help.



Soon, more later from the North of Gaza Strip.

BEN MARCUS READS AT EXHIBIT X

=20

On October 26, fiction writer Ben Marcus will be the first guest of the
2004-2005 season of the Exhibit X Fiction series. Marcus will read a
selection from his recent fiction, as well as answer audience questions
about his on-going projects. All Exhibit X readings are free and open to =
the
public.=20

=20

Time:=20

7:00pm

=20

Place:

The reading will be held across from Hallwalls' new location at:

Trinity Episcopal Church, The Marfield Room, 371 Delaware Avenue in =
Buffalo

((Please Note: the location is listed incorrectly on UB's "Wednesday's =
at 4"
calendar due to Hallwalls' ongoing construction.))

Ben Marcus is the author of Notable American Women (2002) and The Age of
Wire and String (1998). He has collaborated with illustrator, Matthew
Ritchie, on The Father Costume (2002). Marcus, one of the most active =
young
writers currently shaping the scene of contemporary fiction, has most
recently edited The Anchor Book of New American Short Stories (2004), a
collection of stories that Marcus calls "toolkits for the future." As he
notes in the Introduction: "If we are made by what we read, if language
truly builds people into what they are, how they think, the depth with =
which
they feel, then these stories are, to me, premium material for that
construction project. You could build a civilization with them." Until =
2002,
Ben Marcus was the fiction editor of Fence magazine. He currently =
teaches at
Columbia. For more information about his fiction, please visit
www.benmarcus.com <http://www.benmarcus.com/> .

Reviews of Marcus' works:

"I don't use the word lightly, in fact, I don't use it at all, but Ben
Marcus is a genius, one of the most daring, funny, morally engaged and
brilliant writers, someone whose work truly makes a difference in the =
world.
His prose is, for me, awareness objectified-he makes the word new and =
thus
the world." George Saunders=20

"Ben Marcus has been accused of redesigning the ordinary sentence, of
emptying words of their meaning and injecting them with new, of treating
grave matters (such as family and humankind in general) with farcical
disrespect, and of blowing away traditional narrative structures with a
diabolical wind. And all this may be true. But for those who would =
describe
this work as fantastic, surreal, or anti-real, I can only say that this =
is
Ohio exactly as I remember it. Jane Dark was my fourth grade teacher."
Robert Coover=20

About Exhibit X:

As a series, Exhibit X hopes to distinguish itself among the rich body =
of
reading series in Buffalo by showcasing writers of innovative and
experimental fictions: authors who are not only writing cutting edge
stories, but for whom an inquiry into the immediate situation of =
narrative,
of what the genre "fiction" can be (and become) in a publishing market
saturated by familiar forms, represents an on-going investigation. All
readings take place off-campus at Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center
(www.hallwalls.org) so that students, faculty, and the community can =
take
advantage of a unique opportunity to meet invited writers. The Exhibit X
website-which will begin offering streaming audio of each event this
Fall-can be found at  <http://www.english.buffalo.edu/exhibitx/>
http://www.english.buffalo.edu/exhibitx/. Exhibit X is sponsored by the
English Department and the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University =
of
Buffalo. For more information about the series, contact Christina =
Milletti
at milletti@buffalo.edu.

Travis and stately Clara

Stately Clara walks into the Darkroom. Clara dominates the stage, Clara's
eyes are samurai daggers. Samurai have no daggers, pointed out by Travis
glaring fiercely. Travis moves to a heard in the hollow of its shell,
close by Tiffany: sounding through fathoms of conversations, these souls -
Honey: who have lost their fathermothers, mewling and Travis: pity! pity!

articulating the movement of the bones which constitutes code. No Time to
say Travis knew time didn't exist. He knew Text as a whole, what it is
about, and where to get it. All in around two pages of print. I would like

Where we are silenced, the silent speak. Travis VR Travis moves through
the worlds. Travis moves to a Space of filtrations, media, proliferations,

Next Sunday: a reading presented by The Gig:


TOM PICKARD and JAY MILLAR

Sunday, October 24th, 3 p.m.

New Works Studio, 319 Spadina Avenue, second floor
(a few blocks north of Dundas)


We're very proud to present the British poet Tom Pickard, who's =
currently touring North America in connection with the publication of =
his new book, The Dark Months of May, by Flood Editions. He's joined by =
Toronto native Jay MillAr, author of (among other titles) The Ghosts of =
Jay MillAr, Mycological Studies and The Small Blue.

No cover charge (though donations are accepted & will go to the =
readers).  Refreshments will be available, and there will be a =
bookstall.

Hope to see you there!  For further details write Nate Dorward at =
ndorward@ndorward.com or phone: 416-221-6865.

"In part a chronicle of misfortune and heartbreak, The Dark Months of =
May tells of life on the run. With his characteristic bawdiness and =
sonic aplomb, Pickard seeks refuge in the geography of British border =
ballads, accompanied by eighteenth-century horse thieves and 'desperate =
reprobates.' There, he finds only cold consolation: 'leave me now and =
let me sleep / your thieving words are all I'll keep.'"


from The Dark Months of May:


DRIVING TO KILLHOPE

hung-over
after a wedding party row

a rush in the hush
surprise of lips
under the duvet

boulders lie askance


grey clouds silver lead skies
a buzzard wings a drift
and the wind ringing


the lady in black dances
in her dark grove

a gorse head
with sun-spiked hair
illuminates speech


caught in his telescope
two seconds late for school
the overseer clocks us
drills obedience
nails time to his timepiece

drizzling midges wind and sleet
always wet always tired
but hush, mother said, hush

soaked feet when it's raining wind
disobedient water in the jigger-house

sky a wet blanket
and the sun a whimpering ball

but hush, mother said, hush

the KELLY WRITERS HOUSE

invites you to a reading

with poets

TONY LOPEZ

and

MICHAEL GOTTLIEB

Thursday, October 21st
6 pm=20
Kelly Writers House


My favourite book of this year was Tony Lopez's False Memory
(Salt), a collection of cento-like sonnet sequences which samples
and blends the white noise of 1990s Britain =AD economics,
politics, genetics, fashion, real estate, entertainment,
literature =AD in a surreal and satirical collage, sinister,
elegantly amusing, and ultimately asking demanding political
questions.

--Robert Potts=20


In The River Road, Michael Gottlieb's wry, perspicacious wit,
acute social observation, and spinning phrases take no
prisoners, nor free any, leaving us precisely where we are--but
upside down & inside out & laughing. Here is a grand tour of
human foibles by a modern day jongleur.

--Charles Bernstein

St. Mark's Poetry Project Talks Series
"'The Heaven-Sent Leaf': On the Artist's Relationship to Money"
A talk about the relationship between artists and money from both
historical and contemporary perspectives. How have current artistic
attitudes about money developed over time? Are they rational or irrational,
critical or reactionary? In what ways can artists thoughtfully engage with
a contemporary milieu--in which the pursuit of money is axiomatic of so
much else, from the pursuit of happiness to the pursuit of war--without
merely mirroring or balking at its assumptions? (This will really be kind
of a working paper - please come help me work on it!)
St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street
(At 2nd Avenue)

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work.  Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Small Press Traffic presents a reading by

Will Alexander & James Thomas Stevens

Friday, October 22, 2004 at 7:30 p.m.

Two magical poets, each invoking the complexity of the postcolonial experience
in compelling and necessary ways. Poet, essayist, playwright, and visual
artist Will Alexander's books include Asia & Haiti, Towards the Primeval
Lightning Fields, and Exobiology as Goddess. He has written widely on many
aspects of African American poetry and surrealism. He is currently the Lead
Artist, and Artist-In-Residence, for Theatre Of Hearts/Youth First in Los
Angeles. James Thomas Stevens is the author of Combing the Snakes from His

it's all over now. we've waited for some
change; we've known all along we can't control
ourselves. our best intentions led to
definitions; definitions collapsed, one after
another, as if eternity melted away, as if
language slipped through our hands. structures
became ghosts; words no longer mean in uneasy
parades. we wait for votes, decisions,
absolutes, that are lies before their forming
in/formation. all time is borrowed; our
environment hardly recognizes the continuous
countdown of species, subspecies, whole orders
of life. radiation bears harder beneath the
onslaught of primates out of savanna, out of
control. everything centers around control, the
application of a function across a domain,
already useless, porous, close to damaged
memory. in the reversed world, suicide is the
proclamation of bravery, as is cowardice, a
creature crawling just a bit longer towards the
future. the only absolute is the absence of
god, spirit, soul; the hedge around the torah
is wilderness itself, and the flames of the
letters proclaim only another tired delusion.
the human race is exhausted of itself; some of
us pray for the end, for a temporary armageddon
in the flux of things where the surface is
cleansed of all humanity, other things lining
up for choice and conceivable tomorrows. don't
misunderstand, the wilderness itself is the
aegis and nadir of pain, self-warning control
systems without regard to the registration of
injury. what we have is less than nothing; only
our despair is our own; only our despair is
memory of despair. the play of cyber-crypto
xmen xplay is already the play of the dead; the
joystick hardly moves, and the dream of
implants takes nothing to an equivalent level.
our reality is one of fracture. there's no
turning back, because there was no progress, no
travelled road, in the first place. we're
living in the burned-out case of the world, the
burned-out shell of existence. distraught
survivors, we dream of other planets, other
stars, erosions. we stumble through ourselves,
in self-defined pathos; we've always stumbled,
but nothing was ever due. now islands disappear
as well, there is shuddering at our own
ineptitude. but whose shuddering, whose final
corrosion, the corrosion of finality itself?

In the days after 9/11 I kept returning to part III of Hart Crane's "For The
Marriage of Faustus and Helen." It seemed prophetic: The apt descriptions of
that morning; the unexpected assault; the perpetrator; the self-incrimination.

     That saddled sky that shook down vertical
     Repeated play of fire--no hypogeum
     Of wave or rock was good against one hour.

I still find it eerie. Here's the entire section (excerpted frp, the Modern
American Poetry section on Crane
http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crane/additional_poems.htm):

III

Capped arbiter of beauty in this street
That narrows -darkly into motor dawn,
You, here beside m/e, delicate ambassador
Of intricate slain numbers that arise
In whispers, naked of steel;
                                religious gunman!
Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,
And in other ways than as the wind settles
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.

                                            We even,
Who drove speediest destruction
In corymbulous formations of mechanics,-
Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice
Plangent over meadows, and looked down
On rifts of torn and empty houses
Like old women with teeth unjubilant
That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:

We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,
The mounted, yielding cities of the air!

That saddled sky that shook down vertical
Repeated play of fire-no hypogeum
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.
We did not ask for that, but have survived,
And will persist to speak again before
All stubble streets that have not curved
To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm

That lowers down the arc of Helen's brow
To saturate with blessing and dismay.

Robin Blaser on Robin Blaser:

Robin Blaser, born Denver, Colorado, 1925, grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho—I
remember by name all the splendid teachers there in Latin, English, French,
History and Biology. Arrived by bus in Berkeley, 1944, met by friends from
there, took my bag to the Durant Hotel, then up to the Greek Theater to see
Euripides' Trojan Women. A fine first day, which got even better when Gene
Wahl brought me Jack Spicer, who later brought Robert Duncan to me after
finding him at an anarchist meeting. I remember especially the presences of
Josephine Miles, Ernst Kantarovicz, Arthur Brodeur, Linforth, Hannah Arendt,
and Duncan's and my Greek tutor, Rosario Jimenez. I left to be a librarian
at Harvard, 1955-1959, where Spicer joined me for a year. Went to Europe for
5 months and returned to San Francisco, then Christmas dinner, turkey and
all on Stinson Beach with Duncan and Jess, 1959. I was a librarian at the
California Historical Society, 1959 and at San Francisco State, 1961-1965.
James Felts and I lived in San Francisco until 1966, when our relationship
of many years faded. During the Poetry Conference in Berkeley in 1965,
Robert Creeley and Charles Olson were folded into my heart and mind. In 1966
I was offered a position at the new Simon Fraser University in Vancouver,
British Columbia, where I taught for 20 years. There, David Farwell and I
have been partners for 29 years. I am grateful to Canada. I am honoured to
find in Berkeley, on Addison Avenue, bronze plaques in the sidewalk for
Duncan, Spicer and me in a row. San Francisco remains my home town.

from “Language is Love,” poem by Robin Blaser:

We must return to the Lark of our speech.
I would have them eat of the heart of this
form-of-life that they might participate in
the form of it.

Language is love—the only way to enter
the form of our lives.

BIOGRAPHY:
Robin Blaser found his beginnings as a poet in the excitement of the New
American postmodern, particularly as it began to take shape in the work of
his companions Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan in the late 1940s. Unlike many
of his peers, however, Blaser has developed as a writer through subsequent
generations and poetic movements; his work thus extends beyond the era in
which it began. An immigrant to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1966, and a
Canadian citizen since 1972, Blaser has established himself as a key figure
on the west coast of B.C. and an important influence among Canadian
experimental poets such as George Bowering, Steve McCaffery, bp Nichol, Erin
Mouré, and Daphne Marlatt. The Holy Forest, a lifelong serial poem composed
of many books, is his major work in poetry and is still in process. The
collection as it now exists in the 1993 edition published by Coach House
Press is comprised of Earlier: The Boston Poems (1956-1958); Cups
(1959-1960); The Park (1960); The Faerie Queen (1961); The Moth Poem
(1962-1964); Image-Nations 1-4 (1962-1964); Les Chimères (1963-1964); Charms
(1964-1968); Image-Nations 5 –14 (1967-1974); Streams I (1974-1976); Syntax
(1979-1981); Pell Mell (1981-1988); Great Companions (1971, 1988); Streams
II (1986-1991); and Exody (1990-1993). In addition, Blaser has published
numerous essays on poetics, including “The Fire”, which was anthologized in
The Poetics of the New American Poetry (1974), and “The Practice of Outside”
, which accompanies his edition of The Collected Books of Jack Spicer
(1980). In 2000, he published a libretto for The Last Supper, an opera with
music by British composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle. Currently, he has in the
works a Collected Essays and an expanded edition of The Holy Forest that
will include a new book of poems, to be called OH!

Researchers at the University of Rochester report some interesting research
on http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=1898.

Excerpts:

In the past, researchers would perhaps shine a light at an unconscious
ferret... “The basic findings are exciting enough, but you can’t help but
speculate on what they might mean in a deeper context,” says Weliky. “It’s
one thing to say a ferret’s understanding of reality is being reproduced
inside his brain, but there’s nothing to say that our understanding of the
world is accurate...."

This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Urgent Letter from Jean Saint Vil to NDP's McDonough


This is an urgent plea asking that the NDP abandons its “see no evil,
hear evil “ attitude towards the alarmuing and quickly deteriorating
situation in Haiti, where the repressive puppet regime set up by the
Canado-Franco-American authorities is getting completely out of control.
Please, you must lead the NDP to respond before it becomes too late.

Urgent Letter from Jean Saint Vil to NDP's McDonough

 Submitted by Anthony on October 14,

 This is an urgent plea asking that the NDP abandons its “see no evil,
hear evil “ attitude towards the alarmuing and quickly deteriorating
situation in Haiti, where the repressive puppet regime set up by the
Canado-Franco-American authorities is getting completely out of control.
Please, you must lead the NDP to respond before it becomes too late.


 Fearing that I would be wasting my time, I hesitated before following
the advice of persons close to your party who encouraged me to write
this urgent plea to you. However, as I was coming home from work today I
learn of more repression against impoverished Haitians, the violently
deposed constitutional authorities and their political party. Yet,
another peace-loving grass-roots leader has been arrested today, he is
liberation theologian Father Gerard Jean-Juste of St-Clair Church in
Port-au-Prince (http://www.haitiaction.net ). I had just finished
reading the report submitted by Pax Christi U.S.A which spoke of  Father
Jean-Juste’s work in Haiti. (See report below or at haitiaction.net ).


 Mrs. McDonough, we cannot afford to commit the same errors General
Romero D’Allaire spoke about in his book “Shaking Hands with the devil”.
Our fellowman is crying out for help in Haiti. The NDP must pay
attention and answer the call without undue delay.


 Before and since the tragic coup d’état of February 29th 2004,  there
has been several brave voices trying hard to expose what the mainstream
media and traditional politicians refuse categorically to touch
concerning the Haitian drama. These sources include
http://www.dominionpaper.ca , http://www.haitiaction.net,
http://www.haiti-progres.com. Amnesty International and other well
established human rights organizations have also warned of the rapidly
deteriorating situation in post-coup  Haiti where the deadly Forces
Armées d'Haiti (FAdH) have returned to terrorize the poorest and most
vulnerable among the population.


 I would be more than willing to brief your office on that side of the
Haitian drama which hardly, if ever, makes it into mainstream
publications. Haitians are literally dying to let the truth be known
about what is really happening to them while the world turns a blind
eye. The NDP must not become a heartless, traditional party Mrs.
McDonough. I want to believe that it has not. This is why I am sending
you this urgent plea.


 As a Canadian of Haitian origin who strives to see a peaceful Haiti
emerge out of this quagmire, I know the NDP can and must take the lead
in advocating a drastic foreign policy change in Canada. This urgently
needed 180 degree turn shall instruct us to support peace and democratic
majority rule in Haiti, not a puppet regime that pleases the fancy of
rich and powerful folks in Port-au-Prince, Washington, Paris and Ottawa.
There is an ever growing number of well documented attacks on the poor.
Countless political prisoners are being held by the illegal puppet
government of Port-au-Prince. The NDP must act now Mrs. McDonough.


 Please, do contact me for further discussion of this urgent matter.
Silence is not an acceptable option for, as Dr. Martin Luther King cried
out to us all "in this generation we will have to repent not only for
the wicked words and deeds of the bad people but also for the appalling
silence of the good people". Justice and Peace in Haiti requires your
powerful voice. Please investigate the facts and help avoid more
bloodshed among a vaillant but betrayed people.


 Sincerely yours,


 Jean Saint-Vil
 Concerned citizen Gatineau, Québec.

Subject:      Violence, Abuse and Neglect in the California Youth Authority
MIME-Version: 1.0

Juvenile justice systems across the United States are in a dangerous state
of disarray.  According to recently published reports, violence within the
system is rampant and abuse of the youth inside by staff is routine.  U.S.
News & World Report recently found that juvenile facilities nationwide hold
almost 104,000 youth.  Many states have more juveniles held for property
crimes, drug offenses, and public disorder than anything else, only a
quarter of the youth are committed for violent crimes.

The video, "System Failure: Violence, Abuse and Neglect in the California
Youth Authority," produced by WITNESS and Books Not Bars, offers testimony
of the human rights violations - including sexual abuse, beatings, forced
medication, and systemic mental health and educational neglect of juveniles
- taking place at the California Youth Authority (CYA), one of the largest
youth correctional agencies in the country.  Many youth languish in
isolation cells, with little human contact and almost no education.  Youth
are essentially forced to join gangs for protection and subjected to
extreme levels of violence.  The death of two CYA youth in January 2004 was
followed by a damning state report that documented the brutality of guards.
 The costs to the people of California both financially and in terms of
public safety are enormous: $80,000 per year, per youth.  Despite this huge
price tag, more than 90% of CYA youths who leave the system are re-arrested
within three years.

Nationally, California stands in sharp contrast to a number of states who
have reformed or are in the process of reforming their juvenile justice
systems, replacing punishment for punishment's sake models with
rehabilitative, restorative justice models.  Texas, New York, Arizona,
Georgia, Massachusetts, and most notably Missouri have responded to the
crisis in their states by creating systems that use small residential
programs with an emphasis on training rehabilitation and treatment.  They
have found that this approach is not only more holistic and more humane,
but it is also more affordable and effective, resulting in much lower rates
of re-arrest, parole violation, and recidivism.

Join WITNESS and Books Not Bars to call for the transformation of the CYA.
For meaningful change to take place and for rehabilitation of youth to
occur, the CYA's eight prison facilities need to be closed and replaced
with regional rehabilitation centers and local community based
alternatives.
Watch the Rights Alert at the WITNESS website to hear from former CYA youth
and family members, view footage of some of the most egregious abuses and
act now to demand change.

Hi  I'm back on board   - "drn" goes Harry!
Re this: before I went to NY in 1993 an Auckland poet I know (Bob Orr)
wanted me to have a look at Hart Crane's bridge...and indeed I crossed the
Brooklyn bridge several times thinking of the poem - or its significance (I
dont know it well - have read once) but also the history of it and I am
fascinated by bridges (recently it was part of a series The Severn Great
Modern Wonders of the World dramatised on Aussie TV which we get on Prime
here (NZ). In 1993 I was not too concerned of any politics...

That changed in 2001 for me - shocked me back into political politics,
polemics etc etc

Is there poetry after 9/11 ?  Such events in world history always seem
awesome but (like the sinking of the Titainic)
..while the do change history  - we realise that we living at the time
perhaps see it too closely: sub specie aeternitatis and in the light of
larger world events it is almost nothing. Which is not to belittle the
tragedy of it.

Questions still hang over 9/11 - I'm not convinced by the offical line that
it was a terrorist act. I suspect the truth of it is still hidden from US
citizens and others: if there was to be an in depth inquest why was the
place so hurriedly cleaned up?
Why did Bush etc want to attack Afghanistan when they knew that (or said
they knew) that the so-called terrorists were Arabian?

I think Bush knew some thing big was going to happen - in anycase it was a
marvelous excuse for the right wing to intiate a clamp down on individual
freedoms and start the War of Terror.

Hart Crane - probably we couldn't (or wouldnt want to) write as he did
nowdays - but his poem is a legitimate celebration of the great industrial
and technological forces - the bridging etc. He was probably a kind of
romantic modernist (!). Williams's 'Patterson' is for me a greater (well it
works better for me) and more "realistic" model (or way of dealing with
certain poetics - and hence politics, history, socio etc - as well as using
a major metaphor - the town/city as Person and including the the ridiculous,
the dull, the bizzarre, the strange, the human, the energetic, the local -
and the more subtle handling of language.

But of course what resonates is often nothing to do with any of that  - I
broke my leg in Jan this year and my first of 8 days in hospital ( I had
just been reading The Duino Elegies and the line "Ein jeder Engel es
Shrecklich" (Every angel is terrible) ( I have Spender's English/German
version) kept playing itself over and over in my mind...and I dont know why.
The poem is beautiful to me but I dont uncerstand it.

 So I can understand how a particular poem can resonate at certain critical
points in one's life etc etc

red clay i am on
in    red clay    i am
coming to account
though track in track out
my place (this was valdosta)
of minor rivers
if i'm too old for this (have been)
then i'm being too old
why in the inlet fiddlers
but the sea
carnivorous trunks

keep awake
drowsy
keep awake
in all this biblical heat
the way likened to a two-lane road

. . .I can see people but they look like trees. . .

in the ear of mary
the hand of martha
in a glance as it's gone
like an audience in the soul
which contains them
    so loved

come in
the sea inside the house
we go across all day
in remembrance of the sink

"Men return from the dead"

Men return from the dead / the mortgage is due / suddenly & it's hard

Harder to sleep with the dripping of ether

Men return from the dead
Not more dead / more silent

What I fear is that I too young have already found
The four or five verbs that I will keep
When I am dead. Men return from the dead
Not more dead but more strange
Spitting (strangely) birds visible to humans / only

We are isolationists tonight & I am unsure why I am afraid
To call you woman. Why I put you under the bed to translate for me

Men return from the dead not more but
Spitting birds & not to the dead who read us / to us

We who say just enough to keep from rising

We whose dead children our women are praising

The impulse is for threading, weaving, making the blanket

The good thing. We whose tubs are full of pissing

Still glad we got out of Phoenix, the cul-de-sac
"the coldest little circle in Hell"

We whose tubs are full of we. Firecrackers
In the tub & now the tub is full of artless glories

Our glories now. I live for __(noun)__

I would die for _(noun)_ if its existence were ever threatened

Our water rising in the tub & drowning in the noise

The firecrackers. We spit / at our women
Who spit onto the children who are also in the tub

Our arms are just sitting there like the sun
For we are also all action / we who do not have to move our arms

About a mile down, as they say / it is wonderful

I live for Mexican food, etc.

Women are heavy, etc.

Nights cold enough for a thicker lover (thank you Paul)

Our women are heavy in our arms, their bellies engorged
Knots of children / wrapped like kites / around a fist or an eye

The _(noun)_ full of the once-dead. Their bellies en-gorged

Knots of children (already dead) unseen therefore human
Angry. These strings that lead an ordinary _(noun)_
Into ordinary light. Children wrapped & baptized, in string

A verb finds form not in their ether but here / in our real- / m, the once-was

A man of action (he who all day traveled
To find his father's grave filled with string) follows a thread all morning

Leads him back home to his daughter's mouth

If ever a string was also a fuse . . . Rolls her into the river

Wraps the string around his finger

When the girl returns from the dead the children
Throw blankets & bones. She paddles backwards / broken wing

The mother weaves a blanket from the children's hair

The father all action. Rubs his thumbs, his eyes
Props the girl (all animal) onto the balcony wall / broken wing

Sets off a firecracker beneath her & then he jumps, with her
Off the balcony into his contemporary bag of skin

My current job : I stand near a long table
With a magnifying glass in my right hand, a latex glove on my left
& I look though you

Years & years for the sun to go down

The children are years & years

We compare their indifference to a machine
A machine is a poem / made of metal. A car races around the hospital

A dog is a poem / made of bones. The children
Each placed on a leash. Lovely, suffering years. Compare the rain
To a machine / made of scissors. To dig is to think

Years: "A machine which does not consider this leash
Will not continue to work"

Must say this Presidential election is beginning to feel like a National
pinched nerve. When will it go away? Last night, in the middle of that five
hour, 14 inning marathon play-off game between the Yanks and the Red Sox, I
could not help but have the suspicion that the Kerry-Bush tug-a-war was
being played out before our very eyes. It's obviously not over - the Series
nor the election - but it's great to have the tension played out on the
diamond and the television instead of, say, one's neck.

Will it happen again tonight, or will it be one or the other in a landslide?
Tie it up  Red Sox! I want this to keep going as long as possible. Whoever
wins, the World Series will be the North versus the South (Atlanta or the
Astros) which will - if nothing else - simplify the political implications.

$7, free to PH members


New York painter, and more recently poet, Basil King, was a close friend an=
d
publisher of the late poet and translator Paul Blackburn (1926-1971), a
central figure on the New York poetry scene in the 1950s and '60s.  Basil
King's talk will take off from the Poetry Center's live recording of Paul
Blackburn made in San Francisco on April 11, 1969, with selections from thi=
s
rare archival audio document to be played for the audience.

Poet Myung Mi Kim will give a presentation based on close attention to a
number of original recordings she's selected from the vast American Poetry
Archives (1954-present) housed at the Poetry Center, San Francisco State
University. After the Library of Congress, the Archives at SFSU is among th=
e
most extensive collections in the U.S. of poets reading their works in
performance. Myung Mi Kim here intends to focus on select poets' use of
sound as compositional component of their poetry.

Introductions by Steve Dickison, Director of the Poetry Center.

NOVEMBER 7, SUNDAY 6-8 PM, HAPPY HOUR, VERY AFFORDABLE DRINKS!

The Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street (212-533-7237) between Rivington &
Stanton


ABOUT THE BOOKS ...

Kim Rosenfield's TRÀMA is both a festive and a frightening book--Rosenfield
has the quiet tones of Geppetto's Workshop, the mummery of harlequinade, and
the terror of the giant swallowing fish. TRÀMA, she says, "embodies a
child's tale but redesigns it to pit the mistranslated circus of personal
ambition against public episodes of wronged military might. Trama is
slippery too: it is upended and equipped with reflectors, so that the reader
seems to be looking straight ahead, but is really peering down and in to a
shadow-box picture of an Italian hill town. TRÀMA should be thought of as
being carried by two itinerant showmen, in a big flat box."

Ideological intention meets ideological surprise in TO LEVELING SWERVE,
Rodrigo Toscano's fourth book of poetry. While continuing to develop his
overriding concern with poem as radical social interface, To Leveling Swerve
extends a notion of poetic diction that is neither exclusively a problematic
of aesthetics, nor enjoined to any one (social or political) culture as
interpretative key, that runs instead as a volatile commingling of the two.
In this book, monumentalist high-modernist motivations are unveiled as
discrete rhetorical moments in history. Those moments, in turn, approximate
a delicate (coarse) national literature on the verge of becoming a stout
(smooth) internationalist poetic.

METROPOLIS XXX: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is Rob Fitterman
3rd published volume of his ongoing METROPOLIS poem.  Of this single-section
volume, Stacy Doris writes: "METROPOLIS XXX is, any way you slice it, a 3-D
(document/drama/dynamite) surround-sound urbanity of now. What does it mean
for an outstanding prosodic precisionist of our times to push craft beyond
all limits, to this realm of sheer evidence and acoustics? If
twentieth-century verse used quanta for measure, today's is a prosody of
'shotgun sequencing,' (to quote Craig Venter) where characterization means
sales. Fitterman's is the first volume I've seen to embody that challenge.
An exhibitionary exuberance of stadium seating, priced to move."

AMERICAN WHATEVER is Tim Davis' ode to the odor of stillborn boom times.
Three main courses of prose-poems punctuated by verse amuse-gueules,
AMERICAN  WHATEVER dances up to straight subjectivity with its pants off,
and attempts to waltz the night away. Davis is the author of DAILIES from
The Figures (2000), a monograph of photographs (LOTS, Coromandel Express,
2001), and two forthcoming books of photographs, PERMANENT COLLECTION
(Nazraeli Press, 2005) and ILLILLUMINATIONS (Aperture, 2006).

It will either be Houston or St. Louis. I'm rooting for St. Louis, but
the Redbirds are 9 innings away from being the greatest disappointment
in MLB history...

HI,'I was reading about the new Cummings bio and i was wondering where he
sits in the geneology of new american poetry.

I read somewhere else that he was at the (in)famous Amoury Show and he was

Steven,

Your baseball sense is slipping. Atlanta is already out of it. The choice
is St. Louis or the Astros in the National League. So it may not be
north/south, or at least I don't think of St. Louis as south, although The
Missouri Compromise allowed it initially to enter the Union of states as a
slave-holding state. So in some sense it may be identified with at least a
certain "old South." I generally tend to think, in baseball, there are
bigger differences east to west. No western teams have a chance this time,
so I guess it's going to be east versus central. Of course, perspectives
are confusing here, as most east coasters I know consider St. Louis as "out
west," while almost everyone in Arizona considers St. Louis as "back east."
Houston is just Texas, which seems like a place all its own.

Charles

Thanks, Leslie, for posting this.  I forwarded it to my daughter who lives

I hope it's a good event.  I don't see how it could miss.  Good luck.

Actually, I think the Red Sox-Yankees IS the World Series. If they win,
though, the Sox will still have to beat one of the other teams in the
anticlimax to end their drought.

Must say this Presidential election is beginning to feel like a National
pinched nerve. When will it go away? Last night, in the middle of that five
hour, 14 inning marathon play-off game between the Yanks and the Red Sox, I
could not help but have the suspicion that the Kerry-Bush tug-a-war was
being played out before our very eyes. It's obviously not over - the Series
nor the election - but it's great to have the tension played out on the
diamond and the television instead of, say, one's neck.

Will it happen again tonight, or will it be one or the other in a landslide?
Tie it up  Red Sox! I want this to keep going as long as possible. Whoever
wins, the World Series will be the North versus the South (Atlanta or the
Astros) which will - if nothing else - simplify the political implications.

One could look at it this way: If the Red Sox beat the Yanks, and Houston
beats Atlanta, the World Series will pit Massachussetts against Texas or, to
put it another way, it will be Kerry versus Bush~!

I say 'Go, Sox.' And don't let us down. Or into Hell for us all.

Figuratively and literally, I'd like to suggest
a different set of dichotomies:

Cards and Astros = teams of Ascroft and Bush

Bo Sox and Yanks = teams of Kerry and Schuemer

hi   when I was a young man was reading poetry and the only US poet I knew
was Eliot - but I thought he was English ..but an English teacher game me a
volume of e e cummings poetry and it seemed  revelation - the lower cse etc
Later at Uni we studied him and other US p[oets but he seems to me to have
contributed that kind of zestful play - at worst he is sentimental at best
beautifully lyrical.  The emphassis is on w c w olson etc now - I think he
was friend of williams carlos w: and I remember reading he was at the armory
show.

mallarme was maybe one of the first experimenters with page layouts etc and
then Apollinnaire...

Cummings was maybe one of those who contruibuted to breaking free from the
old lineated styles - the neccessity of it, the imnperative.

cummings's use of lower case, according to Guy Davenport, came from Don
Marquis's Archy and Mehitable series about a cockroach who typed out
verse stories, but couldn't hit, of course, the shift key (ca. 1916):

http://www.donmarquis.com/archy/index.html

Really lovely stuff. Reading it, one soon becomes aware that cummings
profited from Marquis in more ways than one.

amid all the stewart hoopla of the past decade, i've still never been able to
get past seeing him come into CBGB's while i was there, him wearing a "Jon
Stewart Show" baseball cap. Perhaps the biggest loser moment I've ever
witnessed.

(and i've also never been a fan of my fellow Jews who de-Jew their name, as the
former Jon Stewart Leibowitz did.)

Poetry was originally both prophetic and eerie and has been elucidated as
such by Robert Graves in his controversial tome, The White Goddess. The ancient
Hebrew prophets and psalmists were poets in this tradition, and even Thomas
Paine tried to explain this to a fledgling but Puritan America. Epic warrior and
religious poetry in many cultures was often prophetic, and later converted to
the romance cycle or perverted into secular law. I'm particularly prejudiced
to Grave's work regarding the ancient oracle traditions, but I'm completely
sympathetic with his recognition of the poet's (druid or whatever) indebtedness
to a woman's dreams and intuition in their unconscious environment. In the
finest Celtic tradition of the 'hywl', poetry is often a trance, a spontaneous
pouring forth, an automatic writing if you will. Poets teach themselves and by
extension anyone else who wants to know. Yes, we can craft and perfect, but the
content is 'inspired' and most often reflects the poetic theme: life, death
and what remains of the beloved. Poets make connections, and that they can
transcend time shouldn't surprise us.

(with apologies to those outside California) (but
still relevant):
FRIENDS: I'm sure many of you are frustrated, as I
am, reading the polls and knowing there's nothing
you can do locally (since California is not "in
play"). However, I just visited the Kerry Web site
and discovered that there are lots of local events
in which you could be effective, specifically
phone banking to swing states. There is also an
option for the more adventurous to become a
"traveler" and actually do outreach in swing
states (we are bordered by three of them). Please
visit
http://volunteer.johnkerry.com/
and enter your address to link to local events.
There is a scary article on Salon in which Ron
Suskind, who wrote the story about Bush and his
"faith-based" policy in the NY Times Magazine,
discusses that story and the stretch run of the
race:
Salon: Who's going to win the election?
Suskind: My betting line right now is, and has
been since midsummer, to stick with Bush. There
was something very interesting from that
[September] luncheon, where Bush spoke for 65
minutes in a very open and freewheeling way to his
top contributors. He said, "I'll be criticized and
there will be a lot of who won, who lost. And just
prepare yourself for [the fact that] I will not
necessarily be at my best. But after that, during
the final three weeks, that's when the real
campaign will resume." That means an extraordinary
electoral machine targeted at energizing the base,
largely the faith-based core of the base. And that
machine is kicking up now, and I think you're
seeing it in the poll data.

I've read that over and over again - Don Marquis - that sort of wry humor
which is vastly underestimated - reminds me on one hand of Frank
O'Hara and on the other of Nicanor Parra - not to mention Prevert - Alan

Elizabeth:  Thanks for the invite, the booklet, and the good news about
your novel.  It must be a relief to have it placed.  Sorry that I didn't
make it on the 15th.  I've been having various health problems, nothing
tragic, but taxing, so I'm not at full speed.  Hope that things continue
to go well for you and your husband.  It's nice to have 2 such talented
people in one house! Best--Maxine

"Name:
Crescas, Hasdai Ben Abraham (1340-1410) (Spanish Jewish Philosopher)

Influenced: Spinoza, Joseph Ben Shem Tov

Influenced by: Profiat Duran (Isaac ben Moses Halevi), Averroism (Abu

Keyworks: The Refutation of the Christian Principles

Crescas is known for his polemics against Aristotelian philosophy
(adopted by Maimonides and Gersonides) and Christianity. He was an
important Jewish leader at the time of Christian pogroms against Jews in
Spain.

Crescas saw the principle beliefs of Christianity lying in original sin
and redemption from it, trinity and incarnation, virgin birth and
transubstantiation, baptism and messianism, a new book of laws and
'demons'?

actually, i've never seen anything quite like stewart's appearance on
~crossfire~... mesmerizing... esp. interesting in that tucker carlson
seemed to take the greatest offense, and not simply b/c stewart is a
kerry supporter... but some harsh words there---if you listen
carefully toward the end, you can hear stewart referring to carlson
as a "dick"...

anyway, for my money, stewart raises some serious issues about the
media's treatment of politics...

stewart in referring to carlson  as "dick", was conjuring up the name of
richard
carlson (tucker's daddy and a former ambassador under raygun), doing just
what cheney and bush have been doing to kerry, calling him (accidentally/
on purpose) "senator kennedy"... totally calculated, dead on...

Good News:

The PO25centEM series will be featured at the Baltimore Museum of Art in an=
 exhibition called Cram Sessions: 02 Dark Matter (November 3 - 28, 2004) th=
at will present zines as an example of creative production that exists beyo=
nd the margins of the mainstream art market.

I'm hoping whoever may be in Baltimore during November may come and see the=
 excellent exhibit, curated by Ana Rosner.=20

I am also very excited about the next line of zines which will feature 12 p=
oets from Philadelphia. With the help of CAConrad, we will be introducing a=
 Philly Sound Edition, numbers 21-32, with

21      c a conrad
22      ethel rackin
23      greg fuchs
24      alicia askenase

29      hassen
30      frank sherlock
31      tom devaney
32      kevin varrone

There will be numerous extras after I've added them to the boxes - so they'=
re still up for grabs.

If you'd like any, besides being behind a little bit in my orders, I can, w=
ith some time, create new zines, of any of the folks you'd like.

To order, go to=20

www.towson.edu/~cacasama/furniture/poae

check out the PO25centEM site and choose by number and name. each zine is a=
 quarter, and for every ten zines include one dollar for postage. all the c=
ash is naturally used to make more zines, so you'll be helping out in the p=
roduction...

write - dozed very little - walk -
a cloudy day - we find the burning
story to be all false - heaven and
earth in the evening - read this lay
antiquary - read loot and assyrians -
& black rocks against blue waters -
WW opens the mention of JH &
exclaims shall we endure this man's
insolence no we shall bring him to
an account - all in all a day of bustle


WW says I hope never to have such
a waking dream again - call on M -
the theatre in the evening - a faithful
reproduction lost in the haze of the storm -
WW ordered a furnace of iron of the
dimensions of the human body supported
by a frame two feet from the ground &
had two small boxes made about the size
of writing desks & covered with black &
a brass plate fastened on the top with
the following inscription: They Say She
Committed Suicide Because She Cdnt
Take Another Winter In Buenos Aires


WW sd pointing to my handkerchief why
look an old rag retains life longer than the
hands what wove it - when the body & skull
burnt fiercely gave to the flames a white
silvery wavy brightness much like the waters
which had overpowered her - much akin to
a sea-weed in its element unfurls itself as a
plant of rare loveliness but taken from it is
a worthless & repulsive weed trodden under
without remorse by those who trod beside me


her eyes were wide & staring - drawn almost from
her sockets by muscle convulsion - the eyelids were
forced in - I cried out & pushed my hands at her & she
vanished quite away - my convulsions gradually ceased
& I slept - there is a very fine panther who plays with
a cannon ball - the leopard is frisky running after its tail -
they all are but the lynx is wonderfully tame - the sphinx
luckily has not shown herself since - maybe she was
only a ghost who looked a sphinx or became a ghost by
looking at a sphinx or is that a basilisk? - it is the eyes
that make her not a sphinx - unfortunate perhaps that
I am getting schooled in such beasts - WW being the 1st

I think Harry is sugggesting cummings was antisemitic - but maybe his "drn"
is what saves that poem - perhaps he is saying "drn that he was (like about
20,000 other great poets, musicians , philosphers and artists of the time)
sometimes ant-semitic but I can still see the good aspects of cumming  the
man and the cummings poet."

Or maybe H Nudel is so obssessed with anti-semitism he cant see past that
block. Thinks anyone eg who criticises the foreign policy of Israel is
anti-semitic, worries about everyone who may or may not be anti semitc.
Makes me think of the film The Pawnbroker...

It is possibly a tedious argument of tendentious and insidious intent - but
it injects a bit of politics/social concern etc into the poetics of Monsieur
Harry Nudel. And it is ambiguous which is indeed a sign of a poem:
ambiguity.

The poem is fairly witty and a bit acidic a: bit like Ed Dorn's rather
darker "Abhorrences"

Paul Blackburn  died tragically of cancer quite young (I believe he =
bravely
kept a journal up to the end - my daughter studied his work when she was =
at
Uni  few years ago)...I found a book "Famas and Cronopios" (I think that =
is
the title) by Cortazar and it wasnt till later I realised that he had
translated that book: a very intersting and often funny book ( a kind of
more surreal Thurber - in fact Thurber is perhaps another "neglected" =
writer
( I mean by the Offical Langpo Kommisariat (just jiving gently!)  etc))

Since finding that book I have collected his books but havent read any =
of
them   lol

But I have heard they are great and I must have a look at them and also =
the
book of Blackburn's poetry I have somewhere.

One advantage of hearing annoucements even if I can never get anywhere =
near
the readings etc

Perhaps Jon Stewart wearing a "Jon Stewart Show" cap was ironic. Perhaps it
was a "loser moment". Perhaps there's something reprehensible about a Jew
being ashamed of his name, even as he draws on his heritage for humor.

Even so, aren't we being a bit stringent when we demand infallibility of our
cultural figures? As others on the list debate whether E. E. Cummings was
anti-semitic, can't we appreciate what is funny or poignant in Jon Stewart
(if we do think it's funny or poignant) without it being interfered with by
peripheral matters of prejudice or loserdom?

Good point. But.

Jon Stewart didn't call Tucker Carlson "Dick"; he called him "a dick", as
in:

"
CARLSON: I do think you're more fun on your show. Just my opinion. Okay, up
next, Jon Stewart goes one on one with his fans...

STEWART: You know what's interesting, though? You're as big a dick on your
show as you are on any show.
"

I don't think this was very calculated, or accidentally/on purpose.

stewart in referring to carlson  as "dick", was conjuring up the name of
richard
carlson (tucker's daddy and a former ambassador under raygun), doing just
what cheney and bush have been doing to kerry, calling him (accidentally/
on purpose) "senator kennedy"... totally calculated, dead on...

Mary Jo:

This is an absolutely lovely poem in Creeley's manner,
though I think the title is far too stiff. I'd say
plant something Creeleysque there too: go all the way!


Imitations can be as lovely as anything else, though
"I wouldn't make a career of it", as R.C. himself
might say.

I'd like to take this as my cue to ask the List if
anyone knows, or has an inkling, of the source of an
unattributed quote Creeley uses in one his early
poems.  It's a quote used as the title of one of the
poems collected in _The Charm_, and now found on page
77 of _The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley,
1945-1975_, like so:


"To Work Is to Contradict
Contradictions, to Do Violence
to Natural Violence..."

To consummate
the inconsummate, and make of it

the unending.  Work,
work, work.

Six days of the week you shall work,
on the seventh you shall think about it.

'Mary, pass the potatoes' becomes
division of subject and object.

Work, work, work.
Get them yourself.

Thought is a process of work.
Joy is an issue of work.

______________
This is quite a rich poem.  Puzzling, of course. Work
is supposed to undo contradictions, according to that
intriguing title, yet it creates the DIVISION of
subject and object.  Mary and the plate of potatoes
she is supposed to exercise force on.  And: the
division between the speaker and Mary as the "tool"
who will do the work he wants done.

But of course the scene is comically out of
proportion--it isn't so unreasonable to be asked to
pass the potatoes, nor in fact very hard work, yet
with the "pass the potatoes"/"no you get the potatoes"
drama we have a minature display of the serious
antagonisms of the world.

With all the further ironies of the poem: the refrain
of "work. work, work"; the statement that in the
Protestant ethic context, on the seventh day you can't
escape work, you have to THINK about it, it's
interesting indeed that the poem ends in the final two
lines' sincere undivided eulogy to Work.

Sooooo, does anyone know where the title quote comes
from?  Don't say: ask Creeley. He's told me it was too
many decades ago and he doesn't remember.  I'd like to
thank him for writing the poem.

Full of doggerel and political weirdness.  A wholly immature and
irresponsible collection of knee-jerk poetry.

Dear neighbours,

Q:  What is the difference between Vietnam and Iraq?

A:  George W. Bush had a plan to get out of Vietnam

I thought I should pass on that I got that video link from the Daily Show
(and the joke above)  from this site

onegoodmove.org

lots of interesting stuff including Stewart's recap of his Crossfire
experience
http://homepage.mac.com/njenson/movies/dailyshowoncrossfire.html

In response to David's comment about Jon Stewart bleaching his name I
wonder if he has ever talked publically about it and does this mean I'll
have to sell my Woody Allen records?

and, by the by, Martha Stewart was born Martha Kostyra? and for those of
us whose suffer from a lifetime of people fucking up the pronounciation of
their name maybe a simple one like Kirschenbaum would be a relief.

all the best,
kevin

kevin et al,

i remember getting the distinct impression from reading the pound-williams-zukofsky correspondence that they all considered cummings to be quite a formidable rival for the modernist crown. unfortunately cummings' reactionary conservative politics have made him less appealing i think for most post-WWII avant-garde poets -- tho why the same should not be true of pound who was far more reactionary and conservative than cummings i dunno. that plus perhaps his "popularity"? interesting tho to think of what a contemporary avant-garde poetics that takes its lead from cummings rather than say pound zukofsky H.D. or stein might look like. this cummings poem floored me when i first found it:

Thanks for reminding me that the man whose work made me become a writer died
on this day. I like to think that somewhere he's smiling about being proven
right about his work and laughing at the people fighting over the millions
he wasn't able to earn while he was alive.

Subject: gone, like a sad old candle - Kerouac on October 21

Jack Kerouac's story is about both his life and his dying. Creeley's poem '
Jack's Blues' from his collection "For Love: Poems, 1950-1960" concludes: '
gone, like a sad old candle'. The following piece was posted by Trinidad
Cruz at
a Yahoo existentialism discussion group called 'existlist'. It's seems a
very
personal tribute.

"A long darkness is ending. Why did he drink? The pain and weight of  the
answer in the exploding heart was unbearable. The wild random accident of
life
and the coincidental answer was excoriating, excruciating, indelible,
indigenous, to the ordinary. The ordinary  rhythmic pulse relentlessly
aching, arching,
pelvic thrusting, toward the truth, the rhythm, the phrase, the sweat and
blood, the breath and stench, the connection of melodic dots that brings it
all
down to the inferno truth: all that death and failure to
communicate. The question was brutal, primordial, succinct, unbearable: how
can the ordinary man love enough to live? Spit on a forest fire, piss on an
iceberg, six billion screaming names. Blood in the throat, choked words,
gutted
and spewed in blisters from the holy, unclean, rolling wave of unbearable
truth. It was just so hard, and they wanted to turn it all off, with the
great big
money switch, the belly hunger switch, the warmer place to sleep; and it
hurt
beyond words.

And I take the beer, because it is more in motion, more a habit, more
rhythmic, and it takes so much more of it to get drunk, and it's a dance
with limbs
in motion the whole way, exiting the pain with each lift of the elbow: the
charismatic calisthentic calenture of knowing, and my body is just bigger
and
stronger, led to an end slower and longer. But picking up the stone, I hear
the
cacophany of whispers and organized reality, like sweaty popping jazz that
spiels and speaks of random coincidence organized into lovers on a
backstreet falling into the smell and wet of real life, beyond the secret
savage cowardice of control and sacrificial endings: and the moan permeates
the
breath of the beast on its upward climb to love. And whacked out, what the
fuck, woozy words, ooze from every  accidental reality along the way,
witness to
the sound, and voice, and sense, of love. Because every single thing that is
a
thing speaks along the way for reason, and goodness, and love.

And the big bang, down beat, solid bump and grind, spit it all out, choking
in the puke of desolation and aloneness, like the shape of time and space,
rest
and sound; searching for phrase, and note, and melody, and bridge, and
break;
like waves on the beach always asking, always hissing: who the hell are you?

and please, please call me. And the moon set the rhythm: die the undeath and

please, please love me. And we called it, and named it, and touched it, and
defiled it, and sanctified it, and filled it, and emptied it, and became it,
and
won it, and lost it: and it was love, the swaying, flexing, double sword in
the heat of the battle for truth; and teen-agers lived it, and grown-ups
died
it: like life never moving towards life. We never heard the whispering
thing.
The noise of the draw was too loud. We excreted the choices we made, and
processed the remains like dust in the wind, but now that is done.

Out of the ordinary, random and coincidental, comes the irrational, the
unexpected, the unprepared for: the jazz of bang, the sense of noise, the
hip hop
holy horrifying hellacious hoard for reality: love is the language of life,
the
rhythm of reality, the end of the beginning, the bang in the big, the
coincidental in the random.

Fuck you Jean. I loved you my whole life, and if my heart explodes into the
void of failed understanding, our blood will intermingle and share the same
disease. I can only say: I'm sorry it took so long for me to come and dry
your
tears, still I know you are smiling now. "

I don't know about Jon Stewart's last name -- I'm not sure if he changed it
or his parents -- but I have been struck for some time about how he easily
makes reference to himself as a Jew on the show.  There is a long history
on TV of Jewish comedians neutering (so to speak) their ethnicity: Jack
Benny, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar.  The ensemble on the Seinfeld show was
entirely Jewish, but Jewish ethnicity (while in many ways always evident as
New Yorkerism) was hardly ever explicit.  So he has actually heralded a
major shift in direction in this as in other areas.  He has had a huge
impact on college students, at least here at Stanford, who feel that he
cuts through the crap -- and his beautiful rant on Crossfire was truly
astonishing simply because you almost never hear anyone speak with candor
or wit and completely dominating the discourse from professional hacks (It
makes me think of Allen Ginsberg interviewed by William F. Buckely).  I
teach classes on comedy and satire, among other things, and now students
want me to host discussions in the dorms about The Daily Show and the
history of political satire.  Stewart may not end up playing the same role
as Mort Sahl or Lenny Bruce or even Mad Magazine in the 50s and 60s, but
something is happening here and it's very exciting.  It may even shake up
poesy.

FolkWax magazine has an interview with Pierce Pettis about his latest
CD, which includes at least one song written by Lee Ann Brown.

FW: What can you tell us about your "Shady Grove" co-writer, Lee Ann
Brown?

PP: Okay. She is indeed the same Lee Ann Brown you mentioned - the
Tender Buttons Press lady - in the script of questions that you sent me.
I met her at the Virginia Center of Creative Arts, and Lee Ann is from
North Carolina. One of things she does as a poet is take old mountain
ballads and use them more or less as a template. For example she took
"Shady Grove," kept the chorus, and where the verses were, she wrote her
poem using the meter of the old song. It was a very simple thing for me
to reverse the process, and add the music. I retained the old chorus
music, though I framed it in different chords, and wrote original music
for the new verses. I don't know what you call that. The old song is in
the public domain, but ours is not exactly that song. I don't think
there's a word for what we did.

FW: The lyric references the natural world, but it is also very much a
love song written from a woman's viewpoint.

PP: Yes, I think it is. In fact that's how Lee Ann seemed to take it.

FW: And Lee Ann's twist, relative to the original song, was to have the
woman express her thoughts about her beloved going off to war.

PP: Yes.

thanks for this. Do you know Laura (Riding) Jackson's (no less controversial
tome) THE WORD "WOMAN"---whose insights Graves largely based (although
somewhat "watered down") his book on. If you don't know it, you might like
it.

from RON SUSKIND "WITHOUT A DOUBT"
New York Times Magazine, October 17, 2004



EXHIBIT A
         I had a meeting with a senior adviser to Bush. He expressed the
White House's displeasure, and then he told me something that at the time I
didn't fully comprehend - but which I now believe gets to the very heart of
the Bush presidency. The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call
the reality-based community." which he defined. as people who don't "believ=
e
that solutions emerge from your judicious study' of discernible reality." I
nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism=
.
He cut me off. "That's not the way the world really works anymore,=B2 he
continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality=
.
And while you're studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we'll
act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that'=
s
how things will sort out. We're history's actors... and you, all of you,
will be left to just study what we do." --



EXHIBIT B
. . . . They got it - and "it" was the faith.
         And for those who don't get it? Mark McKinnon, a longtime senior
media adviser to Bush, who now runs his own consulting firm and helps the
president, explained that to me in late 2002. He started by challenging Me.
"You think he's an idiot, don't you?" I said, no, I didn't. "No, you do, al=
l
of you do, up and down the West Coast, the East Coast, a few blocks in
southern Manhattan called Wall Street. Let me clue you in. We don't care.
You see, you're outnumbered 2 to 1 by folks in the big, wide middle of
America, busy working people who don't read The New York Times or Washingto=
n
Post or The L.A. Times. And you know what they like? They like the way he
walks and the way he points, the way he exudes confidence. They have faith
in him. And when you attack him for his malaprops, his jumbled syntax, it's
good for us. Because you know what those folks don't like? They don't like
you." In this instance, the final =B3you," of course, meant the entire
reality-based community.

Subject:      Ken Starr to defend O'Reilly???!!!
Mime-version: 1.0

Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Has anyone verified the truth of this rumor going around the Internet that
Bill O'Reilly has hired Kenneth Starr as his attorney to defend himself
against sexual harassment charges? Apparently O'Reilly's theory is that
Starr is most suited to determine the distinctions between talking about the
use of a vibrator versus actually implying the use of one in a manner that
may be considered abusive in the context of subjecting an employee to a
non-consensual conversation of a sexually enriched nature. Now that tape
recordings of O'Reilly are assumed to be entered as evidence in court,
O'Reilly, apparently, has much greater reason for concern. Starr, for
whatever reason, is considered an expert on these kinds of distinctions or
what O'Reilly - on his show - would typically describe as important
'factors' when establishing someone's credibility or ridiculous lack
thereof.

Earning a various 60 million dollars a year it's assumed that whatever Starr
will charge, O'Reilly will consider it a bargain. Fox Network - who
sponsor's O'Reilly's show also earns 60 million in profits from the show.
Fox is considered a big loser if O'Reilly 'goes down', so to speak.

I've been watching The Daily Show since Jon Stewart took over
from that pompous ass (some blonde dude who moved to CBS and
then finally got his ass canned), and JS was totally nervous
at first--it was so endearing to watch--and has bloomed,
really, into a comic and political force.  The previous
incarnation of TDS was sophomoric and only sometimes witty.

As much as I loved his Crossfire performance--thanks for
posting it--(I thought I would have to wince through it,
having heard the name-calling, which is only at the very end
and barely audible), I agree with Tucker Carlson that his
interviews tend to be the weakest aspect of the show.  That
is probably the only time I will ever state publicly, "I
agree with Tucker Carlson..."

If poetry should be at least an interesting as TV, The Daily
Show has upped the ante--simply on the level of a cultural
critique that's funny.

My only worry is the eventual mainstreaming of the show will
lessen its edginess, a la Saturday Night Live.

I am so worried that when responding to the Dalachinsky poem the format will

Anyway, this poem is brilliant and hilarious. Even some semites are anti-smt.

Mary asked:
..|  How can I insure that what I compose/cut/paste
..|  will translate through cyberspace without
..|  hypertext code?


Non-ASCII characters behave badly when you paste them into your email
or, heaven forbid, if you are using MS Word or some other print
application to compose email (or to compose Web pages - *from which* one
may copy/paste).



..|  Why are list servers so
..|  anti-apostrophic?

Different strokes for proprietary folks: competing and/or disparate
applications *from which* you compose anything uses different
entity-codings to represent the same characters. That's why you often
see 'screw-ups' where apostrophes or quotes should be because the
'curved apostrophe' and 'curly quotes' (sometimes called 'smart' or
'intelligent' quotes) are common character entities which are not
included in the original cross-platform-compatible standard ASCII code
(which only include the straight ' and " characters). Some email
applications and listservs are able to compensate ('stupefy') for this,
others are not.

The effect is unpredictability when you compose text in bloated useless
(and Macro-enabled and therefore virus nurturing -- but that's another
story) word processor applications like, for instance, MS Word
(applications made to produce *printed* material exclusively, not screen
material ~ that's why they use curly quotes and curved apostrophes).

You might also experience problems translating between Mac and
Windows-based PC character-entity sets. See URL below.

The long and the short of it is that MS Word and other various 'word
processors' are proprietary *print* applications (meaning that they are
meant exclusively for producing proprietary *printed* matter ~ that is
stuff meant to be sent to your printer, not over cyberspace) and
therefore stuff sent over the internet 'independent of' (ie.
non-proprietary) these useless bloated applications (ie. without the
app. itself ~ just, say, an internet browser or email app.) loses the
ability to interpret the character entities correctly and instead just
displays that junk you see (ie. the entity itself) in place of the
correct ASCII symbol. In the same way, using Macs with print
applications compounds the proprietary entity problem and especially
won't play nice with standard ASCII.

You may ask why Microsoft etc. won't make a fix to correct this stuff?
Well, it's too late is mainly the answer -- too late to change the
alphabet (ASCII) -- and besides why fix yesterday's crap (it's more than
they care to handle) + why help along the competition (the
non-proprietary). But the largest reason is a whole new lump of crap is
on the way ie. Longhorn.

Take my advice: Macs and PCs are not typewriters.

Hi all,

Here are the remainder of Boog City's Fall events. Mark your calendars, por
favor. (more info to follow.)

Two events in our "d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press" series.
These events take place at

ACA Galleries
529 W.20th St., 5th Flr.
NYC

and there will be wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers, too.

First up:

A 30th Anniversary Celebration for

Kelsey St. Press (Berkeley, Calif.)

which has been publishing innovative
writing by women since 1974

Thurs. Nov. 4, 6:00 p.m.

Event will be hosted by Kelsey St. Press co-founders
Patricia Dienstfrey and Rena Rosenwasser

Featuring readings from:

Mei-mei Berssenbrugge
Patricia Dienstfrey
Carol Mirakove

With music by

The Leader

-------

Next up:

The Poker (Cambridge, Mass.)

Thurs, Dec. 2, 6:00 p.m.

Event will be hosted by Poker editor Dan Bouchard

Readers and musician TBD.

-------

And onto our last event of the fall.

Boog is going to be publishing, jointly with David Baratier's Pavement Saw
Press, our first single-author perfect-bound book, Sean Cole's The December
Project. The book will be a collection of daily postcard poems that Sean has
written me each December for the past three years, plus postcards that will
be written this December.

To help raise money to produce the book I'll be throwing one of our Perfect
Album Live shows. In celebration of the 25th anniversary of its release,
we're going to perform Pink Floyd's The Wall, preceded by a short poetry
reading. Since it's Sean's night, I've asked him to select all the musicians
and poets who will be performing, and to read a little bit from the book,
too.

The event will take place on

Tues. Dec. 14, 7:00 p.m.
Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery (diagonally across from CBGB's)
NYC

Musicians will include:

Aaron Seven
The Feverfew
Matt Hunter
I Feel Tractor
Loggia
Schwervon
Alan Semerdjian

And that's fall in Boog City. Hope you can come down, have some fun, and say
hello.

as ever,
David

Robin Blaser on Robin Blaser:

Robin Blaser, born Denver, Colorado, 1925, grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho—I
remember by name all the splendid teachers there in Latin, English, French,
History and Biology. Arrived by bus in Berkeley, 1944, met by friends from
there, took my bag to the Durant Hotel, then up to the Greek Theater to see
Euripides' Trojan Women. A fine first day, which got even better when Gene
Wahl brought me Jack Spicer, who later brought Robert Duncan to me after
finding him at an anarchist meeting. I remember especially the presences of
Josephine Miles, Ernst Kantarovicz, Arthur Brodeur, Linforth, Hannah Arendt,
and Duncan's and my Greek tutor, Rosario Jimenez. I left to be a librarian
at Harvard, 1955-1959, where Spicer joined me for a year. Went to Europe for
5 months and returned to San Francisco, then Christmas dinner, turkey and
all on Stinson Beach with Duncan and Jess, 1959. I was a librarian at the
California Historical Society, 1959 and at San Francisco State, 1961-1965.
James Felts and I lived in San Francisco until 1966, when our relationship
of many years faded. During the Poetry Conference in Berkeley in 1965,
Robert Creeley and Charles Olson were folded into my heart and mind. In 1966
I was offered a position at the new Simon Fraser University in Vancouver,
British Columbia, where I taught for 20 years. There, David Farwell and I
have been partners for 29 years. I am grateful to Canada. I am honoured to
find in Berkeley, on Addison Avenue, bronze plaques in the sidewalk for
Duncan, Spicer and me in a row. San Francisco remains my home town.

from “Language is Love,” poem by Robin Blaser:

We must return to the Lark of our speech.
I would have them eat of the heart of this
form-of-life that they might participate in
the form of it.

Language is love—the only way to enter
the form of our lives.

BIOGRAPHY:
Robin Blaser found his beginnings as a poet in the excitement of the New
American postmodern, particularly as it began to take shape in the work of
his companions Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan in the late 1940s. Unlike many
of his peers, however, Blaser has developed as a writer through subsequent
generations and poetic movements; his work thus extends beyond the era in
which it began. An immigrant to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1966, and a
Canadian citizen since 1972, Blaser has established himself as a key figure
on the west coast of B.C. and an important influence among Canadian
experimental poets such as George Bowering, Steve McCaffery, bp Nichol, Erin
Mouré, and Daphne Marlatt. The Holy Forest, a lifelong serial poem composed
of many books, is his major work in poetry and is still in process. The
collection as it now exists in the 1993 edition published by Coach House
Press is comprised of Earlier: The Boston Poems (1956-1958); Cups
(1959-1960); The Park (1960); The Faerie Queen (1961); The Moth Poem
(1962-1964); Image-Nations 1-4 (1962-1964); Les Chimères (1963-1964); Charms
(1964-1968); Image-Nations 5 –14 (1967-1974); Streams I (1974-1976); Syntax
(1979-1981); Pell Mell (1981-1988); Great Companions (1971, 1988); Streams
II (1986-1991); and Exody (1990-1993). In addition, Blaser has published
numerous essays on poetics, including “The Fire”, which was anthologized in
The Poetics of the New American Poetry (1974), and “The Practice of Outside”
, which accompanies his edition of The Collected Books of Jack Spicer
(1980). In 2000, he published a libretto for The Last Supper, an opera with
music by British composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle. Currently, he has in the
works a Collected Essays and an expanded edition of The Holy Forest that
will include a new book of poems, to be called OH!

Here's a note from Charles Alexander, of Chax Press and POG, about Robin
Blaser, who'll be reading Saturday evening at 7pm at ORTSPACE (121 East 7th
Street) and giving a talk followed by discussion, in the same space, Sunday
at 3pm:

A Reading Not To Be Missed. A Unique Opportunity That May Not Come Again.

I want to make a personal plea to all of you to attend the reading this
Saturday night, 7pm at Orts, 121 E. Seventh Street (the entrance along the
side alley -- you can't miss it), by Robin Blaser. I'm going to try to
write briefly about why you should come.

First, Robin Blaser is truly a great poet, and perhaps I mean that in an
unfashionable, old way -- i.e. that if one were making canons of poetry, he
would be one of a small handful of living North American poets I would want
in that canon. He's that good, that smart, has stayed that connected with
the roots of his work as well as with developing innovative writing over
the past 50-plus years. Looking back, I can see no reading in Tucson over
the last couple of years that holds the promise of this one, nor one to
come, and I say that while thinking there have been a lot of splendid,
inspiring readings over that period, and to come -- this one just promises
more.

You may not know a lot about Robin Blaser. He was born in Colorado in 1925,
raised in Idaho, and arrived by bus in Berkeley in 1944. He was one of the
three primary poets of the San Francisco Renaissance, the others being
Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer. The San Francisco Renaissance was a part of
one of the most significant periods of change in the poetry of the last
century -- a time in which, collectively, such schools and movements as the
San Francisco Renaissance, the Beats, the Black Mountain Poets, the New
York School, and the Deep Image poets collectively overturned a kind of
forced-order hegemony that had been in place in American poetry, one that
was perhaps most firmly represented by the "formalist" poetics of Allen
Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Robert Penn Warren, etc. One of the early telling
breaks in that hegemony was when, after first accepting an essay by Robert
Duncan for the Kenyon Review, that essay was then rejected because of
Duncan's homosexuality. Duncan would find community in the lifestyles and
poetics of Blaser and Spicer, as well as with poets active at Black
Mountain (Charles Olson and Robert Creeley) and significantly with Denise
Levertov. These poets also re-established connections that had been broken
with American modernist poetry (H.D., Williams, Pound, etc.) and with
second generation modernists that were completely ignored by the poetic
powers-that-be, such as the Objectivists. Among all the other groups, what
these poets brought into American poetry was more than a poetic revolution,
but one that admitted of differences in culture, lifestyle, politics, and
more. Significantly, Blaser, as well as Duncan and Levertov, would go on to
write some of the great political poetry of the Viet Nam period, and to
have continuing effects on and involvement with the development of
postmodern poetry and poetics.

Blaser attended important poetry conferences in Vancouver, and ended up, in
1966, staying there, and later becoming a Canadian citizen. As many of you
know, Vancouver has been a key site for poetry at least since the 1965
Vancouver Poetry Conference. It has also been a hotbed of experimental
poetics, and Blaser has been at its center as teacher, poet, and friend to
many -- including bpNichol, Steve McCaffery, and others who have helped
foment continuing opening of poetic possibilities over the last four
decades.

Blaser has published many important books (The Moth Poem, Image-Nations,
Cups, Suddenly, Harp-Trees, Syntax, Pell Mell, and more), but he has also
followed a calling to bravely understand the entirety of his work as one
opus, and the book of that opus, The Holy Forest, was published in its
latest incarnation in 1993 by Coach House Press. I know that when that book
came out I couldn't remember a more stunning and important publication of
poetry in my lifetime of reading. The Holy Forest, in a more up-to-date
edition (Blaser continues to write new and wonderful work), will be
published again within the next few years. I'm not going to post poems of
his here. You can search for him on google and find plenty. I just want to
personally attest to his great value.

Robin is a great reader and an entirely engaging human being. I had the
pleasure of hearing him a few years ago in Buffalo, New York. I feel
incredibly lucky that I am able to hear him again, here in Tucson. For most
of us here, it may be the last chance to hear him. I urge you, please don't
miss it.



Also, come to support POG. It's been a few years since POG drew about 90
people to a reading by Bernadette Mayer and Barbara Cully. POG continues to
attract what are good audiences for poetry readings, but all of us involved
with the organization would get a great boost from seeing an audience of 90
or even more. We need you. We believe we are providing great value to this
community, and we hope you choose to accept that value -- come see and hear
for yourselves. If you are a poet or care about poetry, come. If you have a
friend that cares, bring her or him. Bring families, bring friends. I am
teaching just one class at this time, and I intend to urge my 10 students
to come. If it were a "credit" class that had anything to do with poetry or
20th or 21st Century literature, this is one time that I would have no
trouble requiring student attendance at a poetry reading. If you teach,
please either require your class to attend, or at least urge them very
strongly -- offer them extra credit. What you do by getting them to come
will only help them. Poetry can enrich and change lives. Robin Blaser's
poetry certainly can do so.

Robin Blaser is also giving a talk, "Language is Love," at the same
location on Sunday, October 24, at 3pm. Come to his reading at 7pm Oct. 23,
ORTSPACE, 121 E. Seventh Street. You may be moved to want to come to his
talk as well.

I would like to hear Robin Blaser read - but as I'm in Auckland. NZ, I
cant - but its interesting the connection with Spicer and Duncan (ironic =
his
essay was rejected as many many of the great poets (and musicians =
atirsts
etc etc) are homosexual) - I will get a copy of Robin's poems from the
Auckland University (via my daughter who is studying there) ..Over here =
I
"introduced" a few people to Spicer (after hearing guest lectures by =
Robert
Creeley in 1995). I have the poem
by Spicer (analysed by Silliman once I recall) :I wrote it out by hand =
and
its on my wall near my computer in my room:

           The ocean, humiliating in its disguises,
           Tougher than anyone.
           No one listens to poetry. The Ocean
           does not mean to be listened to. A drop
           Or crash of water. It means nothing.
           It
           Is bread and butter.
           Pepper and salt. The death
           That young men hope for. Aimelssly
           It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals.
           No one listens to poetry.

.

     I was reading about some major (US) women poets and the writer (Lyn
Keller - I like her ciritical work) makes interesting connections eg =
with
Dunacm and - the way his poem is "endless " or beginninglesss...and =
allows
itself certain personal freedoms - somehow goes "into" the abstract and =
the
"personal" but useds "collage" etc....but I havent read Duncan (
unfortunately I was put off Duncan way by a New Zealand writer ciritic C =
K
Stead when I read a critique/comment of his reading style as being =
"boomy"
and over the top... (Stead is a good writer but some of his opinions are =
a
bit fixated) but Ducan is yet another writer I must look at again more
closely)...and (Lyn Keller) connects the writing of Blau du Plessis and
Carla Harryman to Duncan.

The critical book by Lynn Keler is "Forms of Expansion ("Recent Long =
Poems
by Women" and I was reading it at the Uni as I was getting inetersted in =
the
methodolgy of du Plessis ( and Harryman is the other writer I think) and =
her
"work" in progress which is one of those works one doesnt immediately
(always) warm to but which is very interesting.

"Aimlessly it pounds the shore".

Thanks, Richard. I wrote that plea, which was very much meant for the local
audience in Tucson, and forwarded here, very quickly & zipped it to
friends, one of whom put it on the poetics list. One error in it is that it
wasn't Duncan's essay that was rejected, but his poem, "African Elegy,"
after his essay, "The Homosexual in Society" had been published by the
journal Politics. I know Lyn Keller and admire her book that you mention.

Thanks for writing about Riding....
I lost your post, but a couple of things I wanted to respond too

One of the things that distinguishes Riding from Pound
is that although she might have seemed to briefly "toy" with
the idea of the necessity to "modernize language,"
she got (gets) through that pretty quick--
even in the 20s, her 20s....

Also, that book written by the graves' relative
is not necessarily an accurate potrayal of writing.
Doesn't it seem like a bit of a "slam job"
(written in part to defend graves against her) to you?

interested in reviewing or assigning for review uncorrected proofs of my
forthcoming book of lyrical love poetry, LOCKET (Tupelo Press, 2004).

Note that while DaDaDa certainly contained love poetry as well, most of
the love poems in LOCKET are different from those.  Though obviously
from the same source.

If you're interested in receiving a "review .pdf" of DaDaDa, just barely
out a year, and that's not very long to read all 200+ pages, e-mail me,
too.  There are some stellar reviews of it online, but reviews with
special attention to feminism, device, music, powerpoint, designers, or
female artists could be new.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Its ok me not being able to get ot things - I remember reading about Wallace
Stevens and how he got genuine pleasure from art exhibition books and
catalogiues even postcards from Europe etc - I suspect he got a pleasure in
NOT being at the place...a strange concept - of course a "foreign" place can
be great - very stimulating - but the fact of not being able to go can be
desire deferred if you like (something complex al a Lacan or Derrida or
whoever)...but I wanted to impart that I am (or will when I have more time)
looking more attentivlely at what women poets are doing and and others I
must confess I previously wouldnt read a book about women poets (I had read
Lyn Keller's book on Ashbery, Merrill and Creeley etc )... I preferred
(previously) to read criticism/poetry that ignored gender implications) but
I encourage those who are or have been  (like me) a bit (annoyed? a little
set in (my) (their) ways? ) to open up - but maybe I am in the minority (in
making it a policy to treat all poets as simply poets (that works up to a
point  ...but ultimately it always gets more ocmples and more "political "
that that....

(Clear as mud everyone thinks!).......

I hope people can se how this all connects back to the announcement of the
Robin Blaser reading!! )))

......Alan Sondheim is not inhibited in this way and seems to move through
the various"waves" of language with no difficulty - its almost if Alan is
driven by a creative demon - but his "personal" or "hurtful poems seem to
alternate with the "technical "or "constructed" (constructivist) pieces
..but as with many works in progress (progress or perpetual motion?)  it as
if we are looking at a river - gazing at a river and can see the water seem
to move before us but cant see the whole river..cant unless we track back
and walk around (that is we can enjoy or be fascinted by the river of poetry
but to get more joy from the greater project we need to learn how to read
the poet concerned , thus know  a lot more about the poet and the poem (all
this while we remember that the author may be dead (a la Barthes)....

So while I 'm here I see mention of Robin Blazer, Creeley, some poems, some
more of Sondheim, and so on: as I said it doesnt matter I cant get tothe US
or England or wherever - its not a place I want to be in just now (if I win
"Who wants to Be a Millionnaire?" and there is a radical change in the US
political climate I wold love to vist again) and I am looking more to NZ for
ideas inspiration etc BUT I still want to hear something of what's afoot off
shore....in Uncle Sam or Blighty or even further afield - lol

I'm guessing it's okay to post authors' works here without permission. There
are a couple message posts I'd like to submit which contain some quotes for
which I have permission; some for which I haven't requested any; and which might
be impossible to obtain. It seems to be a practice here, but I don't want to
be a violator. I can't imagine any members of Poetics would have objections
other than critical misinterpretations of their works. My rebellious nature is
usually operative, but I kind of like it here.

What you have just read are the opening lines of a poem called "War,"
written by Ted Lardner who teaches writing and lives in Ohio. His poems
have appeared in Caliban, 5am, LUNA, Clackamas Literary Review, and other
journals. If you want to pick up "War" where this announcement of it

The Poem

So vital. So unimportant.
And after that you laugh.

"Where it belongs after all."

As much of life as I may safely confuse
Falls from your hands. The escape is travel
Exercising its belief in qualities isolated
By sleep and best left out of earshot.
Too much sense for one chance to confuse the law.

Birds strike out
Negotiating conduct negotiating
Mercy and sullen movements like guests who
Bring silence to the grooves.
The boy with blue hair
In the moonlight
Is too modest. Page across the light he sits before.
It's the things getting out that worry us.

the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Like many of you I read and admired the obituary for Carl Rakosi that
was published in the current issue of the Poetry Project Newsletter.
And like many of you I was sad to see it was published anonymously.
I wanted to be able to thank its author for writing such a perceptive
and insightful article about Carl Rakosi, a poet who, I realized
after reading the unattributed obituary, I hadn't known half as well
as I thought I had.  Anyhow it occurred to me that the true author
shouldn't be hard to find, I could indeed call the Poetry project and
try to peel away the veil of secrecy surrounding the author's
identity OR through so-called 'internal evidence" I could identify
him or her through subtle verbal cues, the kind which have persuaded
many that Oxford wrote Shakespeare and Philip Larkin wrote all those
anti-bebop letters to the editor of UK TRAD JAZZ in the 1950s.  The
first thing that leaped out at me was the way the author thanked
Rakosi for the gift of friendship with Jen Hofer.  I thought to
myself, oh dear, that's not narrowing it down much, for Jen Hofer has
more friends than Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff put together.  What
about the author's claim to have participated in the December 2002
tribute for Rakosi at Beyond Baroque in Venice, CA.  Listen to this,
"Jerome Rothenberg, Paul Vangelisti, Wanda Coleman, and I also
participated along with several others."  I kept thinking, if only
the "several others" has been named, I'd be closer.  Could it be Jen
Hofer herself writing the article and seeking to keep her anonymity
through confusion with several thousand of her friends?  Like the
purloined letter?  For a few weeks my thoughts kept straying in this
direction until I happened upon another sentence in the article, one
I'd inexplicably overlooked earlier.  "I read a Rakosi poem entitled,
'OK.'"  Eureka, all I had to do was call Beyond Baroque and speak to
the helpful people there, all of whom remembered vividly the
sensitive rendition of OK by the Philadelphia poet Thomas Devaney.

Therefore I say it was him!  If I'm wrong, sue me,

Tom if you're on the list step forward and accept the thanks of a
grateful nation.

Dear all: to inaugurate The Exchange Rate Reading Series, a reading
series dedicated solely to fostering artistic activity between Canada
and the US (or just Buffalo),

P L E A S E  C O M E

Friday October 29th at 8 pm
74 Cottage Street, Upper Apt.
Buffalo, NY

T O  H E A R

Gregory Betts from Hamilton (Ontario)
Derek Beaulieu from Calgary (Alberta)
Rob McLennan from Ottawa (Ontario)

A N D  of course T O  E A T & D R I N K!

Please feel free to extend this invitation to anyone at all you think
would be interested--I'm hoping this can be an event that will attract
people inside & outside English Departments and the academic
community.

Derek Beaulieu is an editor, writer and arts worker. He is the past
publisher of Housepress and is the author of with wax (Coach House
2003). He is currently co-editing an issue of Open Letter and an
anthology of new Canadian poetry, as well as working on a 248 painting
series interpreting a single day's newspaper.

Gregory Betts has edited two books of early avant-garde Canadian
poetry (Exile Editions, 2003), with a third forthcoming on the
experimental writing of Lawren Harris (Exile Editions, 2004). He has
been the Assistant Director of the North American Centre for
Interdisciplinary Poetics (www.poetics.yorku.ca) since 2001, and is
completing his dissertation on the Canadian avant-garde. His first
book of poetry, If Language, collects the myths of humans struggling
to speak against the flow of linear language and, through the form of
the anagram, attempts the same. It was short-listed for Spineless
Books' Fitzpatrick O'Dinn Prize for Constraint-Based Literature (Rhode
Island). It will be published by Book Thug this fall.

Rob McLennan is the author of ten trade poetry collections, most
recently what's left (Talonbooks), and stone, book one (Palimpsest
Press), and the editor of the anthologies side/lines: a new canadian
poetics (Insomniac Press), YOU & YOUR BRIGHT IDEAS: NEW MONTREAL
WRITING (with Andy Brown, Vehicule Press) & Groundswell: best of
above/ground press, 1993-2003 (Broken Jaw). The editor/publisher of
above/ground press & STANZAS magazine (for long poems/sequences) since
they both began in 1993, his own poetry, fiction & reviews have
appeared in print in eight countries, three of which he has done
reading tours in. In 1999 he won the Canadian Authors' Association /
Air Canada Prize for most promising writer in any genre in Canada
under the age of 30. He also runs SPAN-O (the small press action
network - Ottawa) & the semi-annual Ottawa small press book fair.

Many thanks to the David Gray Chair of Poetry and Letters and to the
Canadian-American Studies Committee for their financial support.

Best, Lori Emerson

IN THE HIBISCUS ROOM

Writer's Group Reading Series, Hosted By Karen Lewis
Featuring: The DCW's
Friday, October 29, 7:30 p.m.
$4, $3 students/seniors, $2 members

The roots of the DCW writing group dig deep into the spring of 1991. Karen
Lewis attended a beginning writer's workshop led by Susan Anner under the
auspices of Just Buffalo Literary Center at the Calumet. At the conclusion
of the workshop the group moved the meeting location to the Arts Council.
Subsequently a small group of writers, including Maureen O'Connor, decided
to get together independently-paying Susan to moderate group meetings. Susan
's heavy teaching schedule eventually brought about her departure and the
collective decided to gather their words at Maureen's house and share the
responsibilities of leadership. Since that time they have met once a month
to discuss/critique previously submitted material. Their group process is
grounded in a supportive, encouraging, fun loving atmosphere. They value
craft, both traditional and experimental, and work to improve their skills
as writers. Most importantly they give and receive honest feedback through
passionate discourse that is rooted in friendship. They don't publicly
divulge the meaning behind the mysterious acronym DCW. Although they do
enjoy being alternately referred to as a feminist cabal, a sorority, the
PBSDPWKRP group, and even a coven, they really enjoy the prose poem bios
that Livio Farallo creates for them best.

The DCW's are:

Karen Lewis, a contributing editor of Traffic East, is a teaching artist for
Just Buffalo. Her poetry, photography, short fiction and book reviews have
been published widely, most recently in Stirring, Moondance, Gypsy Magazine,
and The Niagara Current. Maureen O'Connor has been published in anthologies,
including The Shadow's Imprint; forthcoming work will appear in The Niagara
Current.  Jennifer Tappenden is a contributing editor for Traffic East
Magazine and a co-host for the local public access television show Truckstop
Intellectuals. Mary O'Herron's poetry has appeared in The Buffalo News. She'
s been a member of the DCW's for 6 years.  Amy Christman is a librarian and
a poet and is nearing completion of her training as a Certified Poetry
Therapist. A collection of her poetry appears in Scribing the Soul: Essays
in Journal Therapy by Kathleen Adams.  Claudia Torres is the newest member
of the group. She loves the DCW's because "they don't taunt you and insult
you to your face and they don't change the nature of your stuff." Claudia
hosts "Truckstop Intellectuals" for HOTF-TV.

IN THE MARGINS

This week's column in Artvoice features an interview with writer Alexis
DeVeaux, author of Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audrey Lorde.

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work. Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Yesterday, at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Mass., four poets, myself
included, gathered on a rainy October day to celebrate the poetry of E. E.
Cummings, and then to walk from the reading hall, Forsyth Chapel, to Cummings'
gravesite a short distance away. The Poetry in the Chapel readings are sponsored
by the Forest Hill Educational Trust; this event was co-sponsored by Harris
Gardner's Tapestry of Voices. Before an audience of 75, the poets read
selections of Cummings' work and our own. The other readers were Charles Coe,
Len Germinara, and Robert K. Johnson. Johnson, a retired professor or English at
Suffolk U., had heard Cummings read in the late-1950s, and recounted that
experience. Coe, a past winner of the MCC Artist Grant in Poetry, read from an
unpublished play by Cummings, then a selection of his own poems. Germinara, host
of a poetry slam on Nantucket, gave lively interpretations of Cummings' poems. I
made the following remarks and read three of Cummings' poems matched with mine.
Given the discussion here last week of Cummings, I thought I'd send this info
along.


The Long Shadow of Modernist Innovation

Stanley Kunitz, in a September 2003 New Yorker profile, described the
difficulties of emerging into what he called "the long shadow of the
Modernists." Kunitz cited the central imperative of his poetry: to "liberate
[his] imagination and the forms in which [his] poems struggled to emerge."

This had been a problem for poets at least as far back as 1926, when Allen Tate
described the Modernists' struggle "to release the imagination as an integer of
perception." So their shadow may have been a little longer than what Stanley
counted on.

That is, in part, what brings us here today, and why I am pleased to celebrate
the poetry of E.E. Cummings. Even the current experimentalism seems to trace
back to Cummings. Robert Creeley, whose "Projective Verse" would influence the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E school, said "certainly [Cummings'] work broke initial ground
for my own generation."

By the 1970s, budding l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets were advised by the foremost journal
of the time:

"Systematically derange the language"; "Consider word & letter as forms."

These seem to be goals met, exceeded, probably even created by Cummings. As
well, his poetry was political, wistful, circumspect, deeply humanistic, all
while taking syntax to a new place.

It is little wonder that Ezra Pound would call Cummings "Whitman's one living
descendant." Yet despite his bridging of centuries, Cummings' is perhaps best
known in our time--apart from the wonderful placement of his poem in Woody
Allen's "Hannah and Her Sisters"--for his use of lowercase.

Some say this technique was borrowed from Don Marquis' "Archy and Mehitable," a
newspaper series featuring a cockroach who typed in verse, but couldn't reach
the shift key. The series, first published in 1916, was not widely syndicated
until several years later.

In an essay titled "The New Art," published in the Harvard Advocate in June
1915, Cummings laid the groundwork for his experimentation, and, in 1917, in an
anthology called Eight Harvard Poets, the first poems in his new form would
appear... corrected by a copy editor who believed them to be typos.

But it is incorrect that Cummings' poems were exclusively lowercase. In the four
I will read today, capitals are used nearly a dozen times. With regard to his
name, it was only after Cummings' death that it began to appear in lowercase on
reprints of his books. This is the result of editorial error more in line with
popular misconception than earlier editions of those same books, where his name
appeared in title case.

Edward Estlin Cummings: Those pesky editors, ever on your case, determined you
get it right.

Hi all,

The location of one of the events I recently sent your way has been changed:

Thursday, November 4, 7:30pm
Poetry Society of America's Acclaimed/Emerging Series
Rae Armantrout & Franz Wright with Katy Lederer
Wollman, The New School
65 West 11th Street, 5th fl, NYC

&&&&&&&&....

Please come hear David Larsen, brilliant writer and generous Explosive
cover artist, read on Saturday, October 30th, 4pm:

Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery at Bleecker: HASSEN and DAVID LARSEN
Hassen lives & writes in the Philadelphia area. Poems have appeared in
Skanky Possum, Nedge, One Hundred Days, and the audio magazine Frequency.
Larsen's poems are big brilliant puckered balloons of Mylar brightness in
the gathered gloom. Great in any format, they float best in the books he
handmakes for them, available from the poet for a criminally low sum.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. For subscription information or
to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be
posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the
list membership to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable. The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day,
and two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is also a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that
we employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are
reviewed after having been posted to the list, and difficulties
resolved on that basis; however, the list moderators may shift with
impunity between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list.
We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the
list moderators may place subscribers who find themselves unable to
abide by the rules of the list under individual review, in which case
only their messages would be received for moderators' approval before
being forwarded to the list; the list moderators may also ask
subscribers to leave the list if they are not productively
contributing to the discussion. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Please note, then, that our greatest concern is the flaming of  other
list subscribers, including the list owners, and/or the use of
false registration information.  The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is necessary to
preserve this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has
always been private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

---------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting the moderators
at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you
are going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but
other important mail.

-------------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> to resubscribe. If you find
that it is not possible to unsub using your old address, please
contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

----------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that the listserv serves as a productive
communal space for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers
who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive a
warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow
policy again they will immediately be placed on review.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

"Thing Language", from Richard Taylor's anecdote, is provocative. For anyone
interested here is a website about Jack Spicer and an excerpt from Ron
Silliman's critique.

http://oldpoetry.com/authors/Jack%20Spicer

http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/spicer-per-silliman.html

What's more important? Art for art's sake or communication? Are they the same
cause? We have visual poetry, spoken musical poetry, and prose, as
beatifically liberated and modernized by Kerouac. Words plead for connection with the
listener or reader. Poetry could achieve real communication and a continuing
connection; if the words were concise, precise, and founded in universal
objective truth. Should poetry be obscure or cryptic? Can it ever be too personal, too
subjective?

Art as symbolism is more about re-symbolizing than de-symbolizing or
uncovering the meaning behind the things of our cosmos. Each thing we see IS a word in
a language which is already symbolic of our individual and collective
manifestations of our essential beingness. Form or thingness IS the language of our
universe, our reality. A thing is a symbol of a reality we haven't yet fully or
consciously comprehended.

The conceptual practice of letting the word flow through us unobstructed, not
getting in its way, is only valid if the words are understood or have a
common objective meaning. Otherwise, that which we 'channel' won't make a
connection. A lasting connection is possible if the words are real. From where and for
what are we a conduit? In my context the word 'real' is opposed to socially
constructed or manufactured existence, one created by a media pleading for
consumerism and moral consensus.

The new field of memetics demonstrates how words and ideas are actual
entities like genes in competition for survival. They drive to replicate. The poet
must now seek an audience in the new media, cyberspace, and compete with a
cacophony of text, audio and visual images. But meaningful communication is love
and joyful connection. The dialectic of the 'text and organism' suggests a
potential for permanence through the word. A lasting connection is possible if the
words are real.

The power of words should be equal to the potency of sexuality. They should
have the same manifesting power as expressed everywhere from the bonding dance
of Physics' theoretical strings, quarks and atoms, up to and including human
reproduction. When do words ever exhibit that kind of power, create that kind
of joy? We use the word 'creative', but is it really?

The alchemists said their work begins in nature but is perfected through art.
The writer's work is to uncover and translate our underlying reality into
meaningful language. The thing remains the thing until the writer provokes and
challenges us to discover the meaning behind the symbol. The thing is already
art.
----------

Here is Robert Creeley's expression of our poignant insistence. Is he
suggesting futility?

"Things continue, but my sense is that I have, at best, simply taken place
with that fact. I see no progress in time or any other such situation. So it is
that what I feel, in the world, is the one thing I know myself to be, for that
instant. I will never know myself otherwise.

Intentions are the variability of all these feelings, moments of that
possibility. How can I ever assume that they must come to this or that substance? I
am trying to say that what I think to say is of no help to me -- and yet insist
on my seriousness, which is a sense of my nature I would like to admire.

Words will not say anything more than they do, and my various purposes will
not understand them more than what they say."

Words
Robert Creeley, 1967
----------

I wonder if he feels the same way about words today as he did almost 40 years
ago. I've just started his "Life and Death", and in the poem 'Goodbye' he
concludes:

did right always have to be so wrong?
I know this body is impatient.
I know I constitute only a meager voice and mind.
Yet I loved, I love.

I want no sentimentality.
I want no more than home.

Life and Death
II, Old Poems, etc.
----------

If the words ever do reveal an underlying and primordial language, perhaps
we'll see that words can make the home. Poets want their words to establish the
life they know awaits patiently and powerfully in the right words. They work
to remember what they already know.

The Rhythm

It is all a rhythm,
from the shutting
door, to the window
opening,

the seasons, the sun's
the light, the moon,
the oceans, the
growing of things,

the mind in men
personal, recurring
in them again,
thinking the end

is not the end, the
time returning,
themselves dead but
someone else coming.

If in death I am dead,
then in life also
dying, dying . . .
And the women cry and die.

The little children
grow only to old men.
The grass dries,
the force goes.

But is met by another
returning, oh not mine,

Time Waves

I saw a man breathe in and out,
three times I heard a distant shout.
I saw myself both near and far,
at first the moon, and then a star.
I washed up on my sand one night,
then out to sea beyond its sight.

I moved and I went out of me,
I moved and washed back into me.
Every distance makes a mark,
between me in my inner dark.
What I am comes back to me,
from places where I soon will be.

In the whisper of my being,
everything is in my seeing.
In the movement of decision,
lies the future and the vision.
What goes out comes back in me,
and changes what I thought I'd be.

The Wife

I know two women
  and the one
is tangible substance,
  flesh and bone.

The other in my mind
  occurs.
She keeps her strict
  proportion there.

But how should I
  propose to live
with two such creatures
  in my bed -

or how shall he
  who has a wife
yield two to one
   and watch the other die.

In This Turning Lovers' Art

Hand in hand in hand to start,
we find and name our changing place,
while our threefold surging heart
pulses wisdom through our space.

Beneath our triple starlit gaze
our cosmos lays both wild and free;
set spinning by our lovers' play,
where touching brought it all to be.

Each in turn takes wisdom's part-
to hold each two, and know as one.
And in this turning lovers' art-
what was not thought is soon begun.

Now More Than Ever, on Political Advertisement VI=20
by Muntadas & Reese - by Mark Crispin Miller

<http://naydacollazo-llorens.50megs.com>To our=20
post-modern eyes, the TV spots used in the=20
presidential race of 1952 appear as laughably=20
uncomplicated weapons, like oaken clubs, or=20
slings made out of hide. What could be more retro=20
than those little gray promotions for Stevenson=20
and Ike in their first contest (or in their=20
second, four years later)? Surely this was the=20
Dark Ages of such televisual propaganda,=20
light-years from the crafty idylls and well-honed=20
attack ads of today.

And yet, if we resist the impulse just to laugh=20
them off, we might perceive that those two bits=20
of superannuated propaganda-the two TV spots that=20
begin this very useful retrospective-are not=20
identical examples of crude work. For one of them=20
is actually far more sophisticated than the=20
other; and from that difference we might learn=20
something about the way that winning propaganda=20
always works-and how it works especially today.

Let's start with the Democratic spot. A pale=20
young woman with bobbed hair and a sedated look=20
(tired eyes, black sweater buttoned to the neck)=20
sits facing us, immobile, from behind a large=20
white placard advertising Adlai Stevenson for=20
President of the United States. With the=20
over-scrupulous articulation of an alcoholic, or=20
a nun, she says, without a flicker of excitement,=20
"I am excited about voting for Gov. Stevenson for=20
president." She then explains her choice:

I think he is a new kind of man in American politics.
He will be a president for all the people.=20
Stevenson has told the Texans, and the people of=20
Louisiana, and California, that tideland oil=20
belongs not to them alone, but to all the people=20
of the country.

In the South, he has made a strong statement for=20
civil liberties and full equality. For farmers,=20
the businessman, the veterans and the working=20
man, to each in turn he has said he will=20
represent not their interests alone but the=20
interests of all of us.

That's why I am excited about Gov. Stevenson. He=20
will be a president for all the people.


In its perfect ineffectuality this ad is=20
something of a wonder, as it provides no reason=20
why the viewer ought to vote for Stevenson, and=20
otherwise augments the candidate's persona not at=20
all. Indeed, the only thing that it conveys about=20
the brainy governor-and that it does obliquely-is=20
his low opinion of TV. What exactly is the=20
message here? That this "new kind of man" will=20
not play ball with Texans, Californians or=20
Louisianans, farmers, veterans, working men or=20
businessmen! Rather, "he will be a president for=20
all the people"-a campaign promise so high-minded=20
and abstract as to ensure that few Americans=20
would thrill to it, as there were not many of us=20
then (and are not many of us now) who see=20
themselves as mere vague particles of that grand,=20
empty "all." Propaganda cannot be so=20
platitudinous and inspecific, but must appear to=20
grab you-you-with an appeal that resonates=20
somewhere below your mere ideals. Although it may=20
at first seem no less primitive, the ancient=20
Eisenhower spot included here is, as propaganda,=20
far superior to that blathery preachment for the=20
Democrat. Where the latter rambles on and on in=20
an unblinking monologue, the spot for "Ike"=20
appears to be just as dynamic and concise as that=20
fraternal nickname. A mini-dialogue and not a=20
monologue, comprising two shots rather than just=20
one (that cranky question from a Little Guy, and=20
then the General's seeming-deft reply), this ad=20
appears to pose a common problem, and then to=20
hint, sort of, at a solution.

There's a black man in a sport coat and a flannel=20
shirt, facing right and looking slightly upward.=20
He asks this fretful question- more a litany of=20
grievances than an answerable query:


"Food prices, clothing prices, income taxes! Won't
they ever go down?"

Cut to Ike, appearing friendly and authoritative=20
in a smart dark suit. At first looking down and=20
over toward the questioner (who does not share=20
the frame with him), then turning genially to=20
face the camera, Ike replies:

"Not with an $85-billion budget eating away on=20
[sic] your grocery bill, your clothing, your food=20
[sic], your income. Yet the Democrats say, 'You=20
never had it so good!'"

As an economic argument, Ike's comeback is not=20
helpful. The ad's real point is not, however, to=20
explain the impact of the federal budget. Indeed,=20
its point is not to explain anything, but, on the=20
contrary, to cast the general as a big wise Daddy=20
who should be our president because he can take=20
care of us. "Food prices, clothing prices, income=20
taxes! Won't they ever go down?" This is less a=20
question looking for an economic answer than a=20
plaint of near-despair intended for the ears of=20
God. As the only figure in the frame (and as the=20
object of the black man's upward gaze), the=20
all-knowing Ike acknowledges the problem-and=20
swiftly pins the blame for it on those false=20
gods, "the Democrats." As Eisenhower depicts=20
them, "the Democrats" are rather like a plague of=20
locusts, "eating away on your food"; while Ike=20
Himself will make things right in peace as he had=20
lately done at war.

=46or all its seeming artlessness, then, this old=20
ad for Eisenhower succeeds in doing what such ads=20
generally do. They must present the candidate as=20
godly (i.e., not just pious but like God), and=20
his adversaries as all wrong: proud, deluded,=20
wrathful, vain, destructive. By such deft=20
propaganda we are ultimately urged to love Him=20
and hate them, because=8A he is who he is.=20
Eisenhower is Eisenhower, and that alone should=20
make entirely clear why "I like Ike." By contrast=20
with that Rock of Ages, the eloquent, ironic=20
Adlai Stevenson appeared as naught-a mere passing=20
cloud of pleasant gestures and seductive=20
polysyllables; yet there is something not just=20
frivolous, but radically askew about the subtle=20
governor, who, for all his charm, is=20
fundamentally an evil being, as Ike is=20
fundamentally Good.

This Manichaean schema has loomed heavily=20
throughout the post-war history of our=20
presidential races-figuring especially in those=20
contests that have played the most on fear. In=20
1960, Richard Nixon tried his hand at playing God=20
before the camera, as is apparent in the ads=20
included here. Perched heroically upon his desk,=20
the reverent camera truckling toward him, Nixon=20
listens with Olympian calm as the announcer puts=20
some fretful question vis-a-vis the mortal threat=20
posed by the Soviets or Democrats; and, like Ike=20
before him, Nixon promises to keep us safe and=20
whole: "We must never let the communists think we=20
are weak." Or:

I would like to talk to you for a moment about dollars and sense.
Now my opponents want to increase federal=20
expenditures by as much as $18 billion a year.=20
How will they pay for it? There are only two ways.

One is to raise your taxes. That hurts everyone.=20
The other is increase our national debt, and that=20
means raising your prices- robbing you of the=20
value of your savings, cutting into the value of=20
your insurance, hurting your pocketbook every day=20
at the drugstore, the grocery store, the gas=20
station.

Is that what you want for America? I say no.

Nixon's posture as Jehovah failed that year,=20
trumped (barely) by the potent glamour of the=20
Kennedy machine, which focused the electorate on=20
the advantages of youth and the possibilities of=20
this world (as is apparent in the Kennedy/Johnson=20
spots shown here). The appeal to fear was managed=20
brilliantly in the 1964 campaign, as Lyndon=20
Johnson's propagandists played on Barry=20
Goldwater's extremist aura, and used prodigious=20
cinematic skill, to float a chilling foreglimpse=20
of apocalypse. Nixon then returned to play the=20
Manichaean scene again, but now successfully. In=20
1968 he stood up as "the One" against the badly=20
hobbled Hubert Humphrey (whose TV spots are=20
classics of tepidity); and then again in 1972, he=20
proposed to save the world ("Now more than ever")=20
from the hapless ultra-liberal George McGovern,=20
whom Nixon had maneuvered into place for just=20
that purpose (and whose own ads were fierce and=20
unforgettable indictments of the war in=20
Vietnam-and therefore sure to help him lose).

  In the campaign of 1976, there was no Manichaean=20
posturing from either side, the nation having=20
tired of Nixon's grandiosity and fatal yen for=20
"the big play." And so Gerald Ford was advertised=20
as but "a steady hand" (completely secular),=20
while Jimmy Carter stood up in all modesty as=20
just a farmin' fella, prudent and sincere-the=20
earthy antidote to Tricky Dick's imperial=20
psychotic. After that oddly understated race, the=20
spectre of the godly Dad returned to haunt our=20
presidential politics relentlessly. Twice Ronald=20
Reagan postured winningly as Our True Father,=20
glad and good, against not just "the evil empire"=20
but the gloomy would-be taxaholic Walter Mondale=20
(whose ads did nothing to dispel the glare of=20
"Morning in America"). In 1988, the ever-boyish=20
Bush the Elder zealously reprised that=20
patriarchal role, except without the Gipper's=20
all-important sunny side. Desperate not to seem=20
effete (although he was in fact effete) or too=20
left-wing (although he was in fact no moderate),=20
and ferociously assisted by the paranoid=20
divisions of the Christian right, the long, tall=20
Yankee Bush played National Dad against the=20
short, dark Mike Dukakis, who appeared,=20
throughout the Rev. Falwell's propaganda, as sly=20
and false and "Jewish,"and with flies all over=20
him. (Bush's crucial TV spots against=20
Dukakis-Boston Harbor, Willie Horton, "the=20
revolving door"-may well be the most effective=20
smear ads in the history of US presidential politics.)

Although in 1992 Bush tried again to Dad his way=20
to power- flaunting his enormous clan at every=20
opportunity, and harping on his military service=20
in the Big One-that pose could not defeat Bill=20
Clinton, who won, in part, by virtue of his=20
seeming spiritual link to Camelot; the can-do=20
attitude, the infamous libido, that startling=20
footage of the teen-aged politician shaking hands=20
with JFK. (Clinton also owed that victory in part=20
to the ornery persistence of H. Ross Perot,=20
another vestige of "the Greatest Generation," and=20
a deliberate drag on Bush's re-ascension.) In=20
1996 Bob Dole also tried, and failed, to beat the=20
Comeback Kid by merely flexing his seniority, his=20
campaign turning largely on his status as a=20
wounded veteran/legislative elder.

In his race against Al Gore in 2000, George W.=20
Bush posed likewise as the Better Father-i.e.,=20
not like Clinton-even though his own biography=20
recalled the Sixties more distinctly, and less=20
appetizingly, than Gore's.  A draft-dodger (Gore=20
served in Vietnam), a lifelong goof-off with, at=20
least, a drinking problem (Gore was a straight=20
arrow from the start), and evidently an=20
indifferent parent (his own children, unlike=20
Gore's-or Chelsea Clinton-tending to delinquency=20
in public), Bush, throughout that campaign,=20
played the father with a vengeance, as if his=20
anomalous paternal act would vindicate his own=20
beloved Poppy, who had been so grossly humbled by=20
Bill Clinton and his hippie gang. (The son's=20
apparent effort to affirm his father's honor=20
eerily recalled the elder Bush's over-long and=20
over-heated case for Richard Nixon, who,=20
throughout the  Watergate ordeal, used Bush p=E9re=20
as his most visible apologist.)

And yet, as we have come to learn, this Bush is=20
not the warm, devoted son that some have taken=20
him to be. His filial feelings would appear to be=20
ambivalent, if not just hostile, his dogged drive=20
to break Saddam Hussein in two suggesting not a=20
wish to realize his father's mission but a desire=20
to cut that father down to size. This Bush has,=20
in other words, been struggling to out-do his=20
Dad, not honor him, so that he might, at last,=20
become a Dad far bolder, braver, larger, greater=20
than the Dad that married dear old Mom. This=20
Bush, in fact, would be as great as God Himself.=20
"Then he said something that really struck me,"=20
Bob Woodward recalled on "60 Minutes" in April of=20
2004, of a conversation he had had with Bush the=20
Younger:

He said of his father, "He is the wrong father to=20
appeal to for advice. The wrong father to go to,=20
to appeal to in terms of strength." And then he=20
said, "There's a higher Father that I appeal to."

Bush routinely vents such grandiosity. "I trust=20
God speaks through me. Without that, I couldn't=20
do my job," he noted while campaigning in=20
Lancaster in the summer of 2004. In that=20
messianic fantasy George W. Bush is not alone (as=20
Pres. Nixon was alone in his imperial=20
self-regard). Not just a few of Bush's followers=20
apparently believe that "God is in the White=20
House"-a delusion that Bush/Cheney's=20
propagandists seem to share, and one that they=20
are always working hard to reconfirm, and spread=20
as far as possible.

That Bush & Co. themselves believe in Bush this=20
way-and that they want to make the rest of us=20
believe it-would be distressing under any=20
circumstances. Within the current culture of TV,=20
such theocratic zeal has had disastrous=20
consequences; and so, in order to survive this=20
crisis, and overcome it, we must scrutinize not=20
just these TV spots per se but study also their=20
full institutional and cultural context. For the=20
modern history of US political propaganda entails=20
far more than the ever-changing tactics and=20
techniques that have been used to sell our=20
presidental candidates on television. That=20
history also includes the gradual "deregulation"=20
of the US corporate media in general. By enabling=20
one gigantic media cartel to dominate TV and=20
radio (as well as movies, magazines, music,=20
newspapers and, increasingly, the Internet); and=20
by abolishing the Fairness Doctrine, which once=20
obliged the media's owners to permit the other=20
side to have its say; and by preventing the=20
construction of a genuinely public broadcast=20
system, adequately funded and appropriately=20
shielded from state pressures; and by rescinding=20
nearly all the old requirements whereby=20
broadcasters were once induced to serve the=20
public interest with an edifying range of=20
non-commercial programming-journalistic,=20
educational, religious-so as to justify the=20
mammoth profits earned through routine=20
exploitation of the public airwaves; and by=20
systematically depriving all dissenters of their=20
=46irst Amendment rights: through these and many=20
other anti-democratic policies, the US corporate=20
media machine has been transformed at last into a=20
propaganda apparatus for the governing elite-the=20
few huge players who own it, and the other giants=20
that use it for their advertising, now colluding=20
with the government to push a rightist program on=20
the national audience, a/k/a "the people."

Aired within a culture that has thus been made to=20
amplify the official line (and that alone), the=20
suasive works devised by propagandists at the top=20
can do-and by now surely have done-far more harm=20
than would be possible in a society enlightened=20
daily by the sort of free and independent press=20
envisioned by the Constitution's framers. In so=20
well-informed a nation, no human politician could=20
play God; whereas, within the propaganda system=20
now in place here, anything is possible.

Artists look at 50 years
of Presidential campaign spots

at the Donnell Library Center Auditorium
The New York Public Library

Thursday, October 28th at 6:00 pm

Muntadas and Marshall Reese will present their latest edition of
Political Advertisement VI 1952-2004. This one-hour, 15 minute
videotape spans 50 years of Presidential campaign spots. This is the
sixth version in an ongoing twenty-year project, which Muntadas and
Reese have revised, expanded, and updated with every major election.

This fascinating anthology, includes advertisements from the 2004
presidential campaign. It documents the selling of the American
presidency. As Muntadas and Reese trace the development of the TV
"spot" what emerges is the political strategy and manipulative
marketing technique of the American televisual campaign process.

Political Advertisement includes many rare spots, some never before
seen, edited without commentary. An endless stream of candidates,
from Dwight Eisenhower to John Kerry, is paraded and sold like
commercial products.

Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies, NYU and author of
the recent book Cruel and Unusual: Bush/Cheney's New World Order will
introduce the latest version of Muntadas/Reese's work in New York.

This screening is in conjunction with a series of presentations
taking place in San Francisco, Chicago, Toronto, Amsterdam and Bremen
just prior to the U.S. election.

Free Admission.  Donnell Library Center Auditorium, 20 West 53rd
Street, New York, NY 10019. For more information call 212-621-0609.

out with an infant's breath


there is the sky
derived from old age
there is one thing stronger
than all the grace of youth,
Claude Gueux, Claude Gueux
is one thing stronger
than the grace of youth
one thing, Claude Gueux,
still everything yields to be said


do, Claude, suffer
a biographical account of
dawn, flower, & what of
"In the GRAVE is the GRAVE & you,
Claude, to the dews of the dew"?


a brief analysis
of spirits flown:
Claude Gueux,
I'm building
an index on
this wee child
of Claude Gueux
who saps this index
rests upon our eyes
the index title is NO
ROAD TO DAMASCUS


triple row of air
plashed with
suns at bay
third volume
of a history
of pointy teeth
trio of Claude
Gueux, Royal
Honey, & "A"


the corner
of the corner
of snow,
cornerstone,
marble turns
to snow -
for solace,
Ol' Claude,
or is't a meta-
morphosis?


Claude Gueux,
let people alone!
he stepped into
so much a later period
than the hawk
and her prospects!
he opened the light
down to the tone for
NOBODY if not for YOU,
fitted so tight into
his waistcoat pocket

Cummings'

sponsored

Harris

English at

from an

Germinara, host

poems. I

"liberate

>
> This had been a problem for poets at least as far back as 1926, when Allen
Tate

integer of

Stanley

celebrate

trace

the

ground
> for my own generation."
>
> By the 1970s, budding l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poets were advised by the foremost
journal

>
> "Systematically derange the language"; "Consider word & letter as forms."
>

Kevin, OK, I am stepping forward, here on screen (hello), to say that I did
write the obituary on Carl Rakosi in the Poetry Project Newsletter. I so
enjoyed the journey you took to suss me out, and the query to the BUFF
LIST, and appreciate your appreciation of the obit.

A big hug and thanks.

Like many of you I read and admired the obituary for Carl Rakosi that was
published in the current issue of the Poetry Project Newsletter. And like
many of you I was sad to see it was published anonymously. I wanted to be
able to thank its author for writing such a perceptive and insightful
article about Carl Rakosi, a poet who, I realized after reading the
unattributed obituary, I hadn't known half as well as I thought I had.
Anyhow it occurred to me that the true author shouldn't be hard to find, I
could indeed call the Poetry project and try to peel away the veil of
secrecy surrounding the author's identity OR through so-called 'internal
evidence" I could identify him or her through subtle verbal cues, the kind
which have persuaded many that Oxford wrote Shakespeare and Philip Larkin
wrote all those anti-bebop letters to the editor of UK TRAD JAZZ in the
1950s. The first thing that leaped out at me was the way the author thanked
Rakosi for the gift of friendship with Jen Hofer. I thought to myself, oh
dear, that's not narrowing it down much, for Jen Hofer has more friends
than Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff put together. What about the author's
claim to have participated in the December 2002 tribute for Rakosi at
Beyond Baroque in Venice, CA. Listen to this, "Jerome Rothenberg, Paul
Vangelisti, Wanda Coleman, and I also participated along with several
others." I kept thinking, if only the "several others" has been named, I'd
be closer. Could it be Jen Hofer herself writing the article and seeking to
keep her anonymity through confusion with several thousand of her friends?
Like the purloined letter? For a few weeks my thoughts kept straying in
this direction until I happened upon another sentence in the article, one
I'd inexplicably overlooked earlier. "I read a Rakosi poem entitled, 'OK.'"
Eureka, all I had to do was call Beyond Baroque and speak to the helpful
people there, all of whom remembered vividly the sensitive rendition of OK
by the Philadelphia poet Thomas Devaney.

Therefore I say it was him! If I'm wrong, sue me,

Tom if you're on the list step forward and accept the thanks of a grateful
nation.

when measurements become recursive
standards are thrown out
we run bewildered in the street
we take secret numbers with us
numbers are "numbers upon numbers"

...I kept thinking, if only the "several others" has been named, I'd be
closer. --KK

The Rakosi reading and conversation, organized by Jen Hofer and Fred Dewey,
at Beyond Baroque was a two-day program in December 2003, the other readers
and participants included Patrick Durgin and Mark Salerno.

What about the author's claim to have participated in the December 2002
tribute for Rakosi at Beyond Baroque in Venice, CA. Listen to this, "Jerome
Rothenberg, Paul Vangelisti, Wanda Coleman, and I also participated along
with several others." I kept thinking, if only the "several others" has
been named, I'd be closer.

  Dear Friends --

  "Democracy literally has to be cracked on the head -all the time- to
  keep it in good fashion," the late poet Edward Dorn pronounced in one
  interview. In another, when asked whether he considered his poetry to
  be "political poetry," he replied, "Absolutely. It's my way of voting
  early and often."

  Just in time to make us think twice about how we vote in a week,
  Dorn's late poem "Tribe," reprinted from the current issue of CHICAGO
  REVIEW, is today's poem of the day at Poetry Daily
  (http://www.poems.com). And just to drive the point home, the preface
  to this special issue of CR, called "Edward Dorn, American Heretic,"
  appears on Poetry Daily's site as a prose feature (it's linked at
  http://poems.com/essastei.htm). Spread the word far and wide!

  Now seems as good a time as any to invite you to subscribe to CHICAGO
  REVIEW, or to renew your subscription (be sure to let us know if you
  already have the Dorn issue, wch is already in limited supply). To
  sweeten the deal, if you subscribe or renew for two years by Election
  Day (November 2), we'll throw in the book of your choice from Flood
  Editions or The Gig Editions, two sparky new North American presses.
  Full details on the books on offer can be found below, along with
  other increasingly promiscuous deals.

  Over the years CHICAGO REVIEW has specialized in special issues --
  whether those are omnibus anthologies in translation such as "New
  Writing in German" and "New Polish Writing," or constellations of
  archival and critical materials on neglected twentieth-century
  artists, such as this Dorn issue, "Stan Brakhage: Correspondences"
  (now out of print), and "On Robert Duncan," to name just a few recent
  examples.

  These special issues are complemented by our commitment to publishing
  some of today's best writing in poetry and prose, along with critical
  essays, interviews, and reviews. Our website
  (http://humanities.uchicago.edu/review) has a complete archive of
  recent and past issues, and describes some of the forthcoming
  material we're working on, including special issues on Louis Zukofsky
  and Christopher Middleton.

  We like to think we've maintained a responsible balance between
  taking risks and remaining relevant, and hope you agree. Support an
  excellent magazine and a magnificent press in one fell swoop:
  subscribe (or renew) today!

  And don't forget to pay Poetry Daily a visit at http://www.poems.com.

  JOHN TIPTON, SURFACES
  SURFACES is John Tipton's first full-length collection of poems. Here
  is a world of Cartesian precision, where matrices and Markov chains
  are revealed by the lattice of snowfall and the improbable order of
  ants. Yet the irrational and the absurd are not exiled from these
  poems, warping and defining their contours instead: "here the
  geography is the horizon here / Oklahoma moves him in ways he
  regrets."


  JOHN TAGGART, PASTORELLES
  In PASTORELLES, John Taggart draws on the local culture of rural
  Pennsylvania to consider the permutations of the human mark. An
  abandoned one-room schoolhouse, a page from an accounting ledger, a
  covered bridge still in use: each offers a "glance / perhaps all that
  was ever possible" into what persists. With wry humor, these poems
  attend to the ecology of language in a season of drought.


  TOM PICKARD, THE DARK MONTHS OF MAY
  In part a chronicle of misfortune and heartbreak, THE DARK MONTHS OF
  MAY tells of life on the run. With his characteristic bawdiness and
  sonic aplomb, Pickard seeks refuge in the geography of British border
  ballads, accompanied by eighteenth-century horse thieves and
  "desperate reprobates." There, he finds only cold consolation: "leave
  me now and let me sleep / your thieving words are all I'll keep."

  The long-awaited followup to O'Sullivan's IN THE HOUSE OF THE SHAMAN
  (1993), PALACE OF REPTILES is a dance and a ritual conducted in
  language, a plumbing and sounding-out of buried histories and
  vocabularies. Ranging from the brief and beautiful "Ellen's Lament"
  to the central long poem "DOUBTLESS," the eight poems of this book
  touch on multiple genres--elegy, celebration, performance art,
  poetics talk-in order to transform them.


  ALLEN FISHER, ENTANGLEMENT
  This is the first book-length showing of Allen Fisher's work of the
  1990s and 2000s, drawing together previously uncollected work from
  the ongoing project GRAVITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SHAPE. ENTANGLEMENT
  is a meditation on loss, damage and noise, as sources of harm and as
  sites of unpredictability and creativity. For Fisher, art is
  transformation, and in these poems-clashing, combining, recombining,
  moving restlessly from Piers Plowman to Kurt Cobain to genetic
  engineering-such transformation is ultimately a form of healing.

Subject:      smoking ban in NYC bars
MIME-Version: 1.0

I've been surprised by the number of poets in NYC who
are not only in favor of the prohibition of smoking in bars
in their city, but enthusiastic about it.  Okay, I understand
not allowing smoking in the hospital anymore, or on the
bus or subway, but why the bars?  The one place where
smoking seems absolutely appropriate, right?

One poet (won't mention you, but I know you're on this
List, so maybe you'd like to join in?) who recently came
to Philadelphia for a reading said, "There are far more
important things to be upset about than the smoking
ban in bars.  We are in the middle of a war after all."

Aren't there always wars, somewhere?  Must I only, and
finally be upset about just this one?  And why can't I protest
war with a cigarette dangling from my face?  How about
banning single occupant car use if we're so damned
concerned about our lungs?  There are microwaves and
x-rays and all kinds of other rays flying through the air
but we can't take a puff of tobacco in a bar?

Tobacco use has a history of communion, as does the
consumption of alcohol.  And frankly, I feel it's about
time we FINALLY allow marijuana use in public.  Geeze,
it's 2004 and people are STILL being thrown in jail for
smoking, growing or selling weed!  How ridiculous is that?

Oh, but one of my favorite things about the smoking ban
in NYC are the signs insisting we be quiet while smoking
outside the bar.  Quiet?  Are we really being told to
be QUIET in New York City!?  Someone pinch me please!
Gershwin are you laughing?  But quiet is now being taken
to a whole new level in the Big Apple with new laws in the
books about noise pollution.  You can be fined if your air
conditioner rumbling is above a certain decimal.  No kidding,
I'm simply not kidding, no, not making this up.

It's as though no one ever thought the sounds of NYC weren't
delicious, wasn't something to CELEBRATE!  Oh my dear sweet
little baby Jesus!  I feel like taking the train up there right now
and screaming with a head full of smoke!

for vice, and a freer, more tolerant world,

Well I guess this answers my question about Robert Creeley's hope, and he
expresses it with such exquisite rhythm in his last piece of "Life & Death". We
necessarily stumble, because we don't know how to grow up into our potential. A
portion of T.M. Malo's 'Dancing Children Disappear' is another way of saying
it.

The Star

Such space it comes again to be,
a room of such vast possibility,
a depth so great, a way so free.

Life and its person, thinking to find
a company wherewith to keep the time
a peacefull passage, a constant rhyme,

stumble perforce, must lose their way,
know that they go too far to stay
stars in the sky, children at play.

Dancing Children Disappear
. . .
5)
there are no mysteries only lies
comprehension eludes us because we try
dancing children disappear
over the horizon of our fear

there are no answers we can see
we make ourselves questions trying to be
dancing children disappear
out of sight in bewildered tears

there is no new law we can keep
what we really are is fast asleep
dancing children disappear
outside the dream that we hold dear

in the haunted forest the wind will rage
and blow our memory off the page
dancing children disappear
into the night that we bring near

we strain toward the whisper beyond the veil
leaving behind the holy grail
dancing children disappear
into the words we wait to hear

once contained in love, and free
turned out by what we cannot see
dancing children disappear
contorted in their parents fear

when the nothing meets its reason
just when peace has come in season
dancing children disappear
clawing to get out of here

6)
dancing children disappear
we all begin contained in love

dancing children disappear
the love is flesh not yet our own

dancing children disappear
out of nothing and reason we must clothe ourselves

dancing children disappear
we cannot bring the two to rest

dancing children disappear
our whole world prefers a mystery

dancing children disappear
we never give birth to ourselves

dancing children disappear
we never contain what we are

dancing children disappear
we never make hand in place of hand

dancing children disappear
we never form the flesh

dancing children disappear
we never make the marriage

dancing children disappear
dancing children disappear
dancing children disappear
dancing
dancing
dancing children disappear
                 disappear
                 disappear

I consider the smoking ban in my own city to be the final nail in the
coffin of an already moribund poetry "scene". Typically it means that
I have to walk thru crowds of drunken, rowdy smokers standing on the
sidewalk.

If you are interested in health, go to a health club, not a bar.

It's difficult enough to get ten people to show up & listen to someone
read poems without worrying about how many of them are going to leave
halfway thru for a smoke break.

do we really want to go there, though?... this falls under the
general rubric of social-community life in the u.s. in the early 21st
century, which to my way of thinking, leaves a lot to be desired...

as someone with a longass history of asthma and respiratory problems,
there are times i wonder whether we're not all ready for the smoking
ban, given what we know about 2nd-hand smoke... at other times the
ban seems to me clearly another suburbanization gesture
(sub-urbanization)... i've gotten used these days to NOT smelling
smoke on my clothes (etc.)---and i prefer that---but i wouldn't raise
a ruckus, either, if the ban were lifted on smoking *in bars*... i
don't spend that much time in bars these days, so it's easy for me to
say this maybe, but also, i figure live and let live...

and most people who visit my house these days and want to smoke are
in fact polite enough to step outside w/o any intervention from yours
truly... isn't this a good thing?...  i have an ashtray on hand for
them, btw...  and i've nothing against weed, either...

at the same time, as someone who tries to cook for his friends
regularly, let me compile a little list here of Things That
Potentially Bug Me, depending on how ornery i'm feeling... and
please---this is just ornery me, the guy who was raised to eat what
was put in his plate---to feel fortunate, in fact, for HAVING food in
his plate (ok?---it's a class thing):

(1) people who don't eat meat.

well---if vegetarians would once, just once, cook MEAT for me, i
might be more forgiving about having to cook (only) vegetables for
them.

under this category are the various oddball spins on this.  e.g., i
go out of my way to cook a veggie sauce/pasta for a number of people
the other night---kass bakes homemade bread---and lo, one person
doesn't eat WHEAT.  well fuck me.

(2) people who don't drink.

if those who don't drink nonetheless bring over alcohol to share with
their drinking friends, why then i don't mind so much.  b/c i feel
generally these days that i need to provide beverage, other than tap
water, for those who drink AND for those who don't drink.  i tend
e.g. to drink only decaf coffee these days, but if all's you got is
caf, that's ok with me.

but under this category also falls those *drinkers* who don't bring
anything to drink to a party.  so i go to a party with a coupla six
packs, and sure enough, an entire six-pack is consumed by those who
didn't bring anything.  fuck that.

(3) people who think cats are just, well, the greatest little beasts on earth.

many of these people fall under category 1 (and why is that?).
further, all of these people feed their cats MEAT.  if you can feed
your cat meat, you can feed me meat, right?  either that, or see how
your cat likes broccoli every night (yes, i understand the
bio-zoological realities, but i'm trying to make a rhetorical point
here).

and in this case, I'M the one with the problem, in fact, in that cat
dander is a serious (as in SERIOUS) allergen, and my wife just
happens to have a death cat allergy, and the people we know with
cats---and they are legion, and incl. some of our closest and dearest
friends (sorry, friends!)---just don't always seem to want to accept
just how damaging their furry little pets can be.  "we'll vacuum
really good."  uh, no, that won't do it.  we cannot see you where you
live if you have cats, period.

i include here, too, those who think it's ok for their cats to shit
and piss and hunt on everyone else's yards.  (yes, i'm living in the
suburbs at the moment).  if dogs need a leash, i say cats need a
leash.

but i'd be more forgiving about this, perhaps, if my cat-loving
friends exhibited simply a greater awareness of how potentially
damaging their cats can be.  if you have a peanut allergy---and i
know at least one person on this list who does---you cannot eat
peanuts, period.  and some people with cat allergies cannot be around
cats, period.

------------------------------------

hey, and i'm just getting warmed up (sorry)... it's a Good Thing that
we're more aware of differences these days, and it's a Good Thing to
try to be tolerant and receptive of same, yes... but those of you
who've tried to put a dinner party together for drinkers,
non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, meat-eaters, non-meat-eaters
(ha)---you know what i'm talking about, yes?... after a while it all
gets just a little... trying... i mean, my house is not a
restaurant... and you gotta give a little, i think, if you want
society...

best,

Come down to Bay Ridge next time you're in town -- if I'm there, I can
take you to at least
three bars where smoking goes on unabated -- although I rarely do it
myself now,
I do miss it in bars -- soon they'll take the other "poisons" out &
we'll be left with
shirley temples... Pierre

As department chair I have two potlucks a year for the faculty (adjuncts to full) and confront the smoking/vegetarian thing on a refular basis. Fortunately the department is small enough so that everyone knows everyone else's preferences...However, following Joe Amato's litany of complaints re etiquette...What about guests who feel obliged to insist that what they brought be rewrapped and returned to them. I'm not talking about main dishes that were only partially consumed' I'm talking about, for example, the adjunct who insisted that we return her half-eaten bag of potatoe chips!

friends exhibited simply a greater awareness of how potentially
damaging their cats can be.  if you have a peanut allergy---and i
know at least one person on this list who does---you cannot eat
peanuts, period.  and some people with cat allergies cannot be around
cats, period.

hey, and i'm just getting warmed up (sorry)... it's a Good Thing that
we're more aware of differences these days, and it's a Good Thing to
try to be tolerant and receptive of same, yes... but those of you
who've tried to put a dinner party together for drinkers,
non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, meat-eaters, non-meat-eaters
(ha)---you know what i'm talking about, yes?... after a while it all
gets just a little... trying... i mean, my house is not a
restaurant... and you gotta give a little, i think, if you want
society...

wow Joe;.
i would have thought having read your posts on this list for 8 years that
we would have got along (similar politics and sense of humour -or humor in
your case) but after reading your list, i'm not so sure.

The NYC bar/restaurant smoking ban was sold largely as
protection from second-hand smoke for the WORKERS at
these establishments and on that basis there does seem
to be a strong argument for it.  Still, there is an
incredible lust for control loose in this world,
manifest in NYC by another law: there must be no
dancing in establishments that don't have a cabaret
license.  This means patrons are not supposed to get
up to dance to the music on the juke box.  There is
enforcement of this.  And, speaking of control, I
cannot read what Joe Amato wrote because it "contained
forbidden words, or exceeding its quota of
questionable words".  Oh, "lust" as in my phrase
above, "lust for control" must be AT LEAST a
questionable word!

Jack Martin | No President Left Behind

Contents: No President Left Behind, A Spoonful of Sugar,
USA PATRIOT Act, looking to postpone the ultimate confrontation,
Constituent Appeal, and Florida

Jack Martin lives in Colorado with wife and sons. His poems have appeared
recently in The Journal, Quarterly West, Rhino, The Hogtown Creek Review,
and Florida Review.

Here is on of the six poems from No President Left Behind:


USA PATRIOT Act

Every word means its opposite. Of course it does.
But what does that do to "I love you"?
How can we survive
empire

and poststructuralism
at the same time? Deconstruction is like a flu
without season. Imperialism is the opposite
of tenderness.

It's always one-thirty in the morning here.

Which would you protect first? Your family?
Or the common good? Look at your watch.
The police may be on their way to your home right now.
Maybe you should write to the president.
Maybe we should do something together.

What would happen if we all form a single file line at the White House
gate?
Probably tear gas, maybe prison,
but suppose he shrugs
and says, "Ok."

What do I want?

A quarter acre's as good as the world,
and I've never ordered anyone to kill.

Do we ever get back what we've lost?
What we've said?


You can find the other five Jack Martin poems in Mudlark itself.

Perhaps so many poets are in favor of the prohibition because so many have
had jobs working in bars.  Waitresses and bartenders suffer the second-hand
consequences of smoking, and you have no choice over the matter.

California has had the ban for years and it really is no big deal,
especially if a bar has a patio or a good sidewalk for hanging out.  Still,
it was wonderful seeing Art Spiegelman flaunt the law by chain-smoking in a
bookstore on CSPAN talking about In the Shadow of No Towers.

If this becomes a huge topic on this list I think we're all in trouble.

hm, kevin, why is that?... like i say, i go back & forth on these
things, and i thought my post was at least *funny*... but my
non-funny point is that people have to give up something (something)
in order to make community... i'm also saying that this is not an
easy issue to navigate... i wouldn't say we have to give up our
convictions, no, or endanger our health.. but then, i do think (as
tyrone williams just posted) having to give BACK a half-eaten bag of
potato chips is just absurd behavior...

in fact when i bring food over to another person's house, which i do
regularly, i tend to put it in containers that i don't need back...
i'm sure, for that matter, that by purchasing such containers i'm
contributing to environmental damage... that is, these things cut
many ways...

and (here's something else) don't get me started about faculty
members long out of grad school who are earning, say, $50K annually,
but behave as though they're still grad students... here's a tidbit
that i'm sure will elicit nods of approval on this list:  i always,
always dread going to dinner with academic colleagues b/c i'm afraid
of what will happen when we get the check... i've been known to throw
in as much as $40 more than i've ordered simply b/c colleagues insist
on counting up their portion of a check... understandable perhaps
when you've had only a drink, completely absurd when everyone has
chowed down...

where i come from, you take the total, add a healthy tip (i tend
toward 20%), and split it however many ways there are people at the
table... period... none a this "count up what i ate" shit... this is
assuming only that everyone is gainfully employed, and i'm more than
happy to pick up the entire check otherwise...

so if we're to talk about how bad the smoking ban is, then i think i
need to pipe up about other things that make community-building more
difficult than it need be... as i say, i go back & forth about these
things---i'm with gwyn for instance in that i have to use albuterol
(as i did just this morning)... but my allergies are not so bad as to
preclude my being around smoking, or cats, though kass's are... is
having cats a cruel imposition on us?... of course not... but then,
neither is not having cats...

nothing against cats, again, some of my nearest and dearest friends
have cats!... but i'm talking about having to put up with cats, and
dogs (another kind of problem---a noise problem that i've seen get
entirely out of hand), and KIDS for that matter (whose parents don't
seem to know when to say no)... i've had colleagues bring their
toddlers over when they could easily have afforded a babysitter---in
fact, when they've explained to me that they HAVE been using a
babysitter, but b/c kass and i are more tolerant (i can only imagine)
they wonder if they might impose upon us blahblahblah...

to which, what is one to say?... no?... once in a while is one thing,
but every now and then i like to be in a roomful of adults... i
suppose i should just be more forthcoming and make an invite "adults
only"... one would rather think that one's colleagues/peers have the
good graces to know when NOT to bring their kids...

here again, we don't have kids, so i suppose some will think me
ungenerous merely for giving voice to these feelings... again, i
don't put a ban on kids at my house, in any case... everyone is
welcome---the alcohol-inclined, teetotalers, smokers, vegans, kids,
people who don't bring anything, people with cats, the lot... don't
mean to appear unforgiving, but between people who can't or won't eat
garlic, malt, etc., i'm often at my wit's end...

so yeah, some of this makes me cranky, you can tell... and kevin,
while i do my best not to be cranky around here, on poetics---already
way too much crankiness for my tastes---i feel compelled to be candid
about these things when the topic turns to smokers and bars in the
crab apple and poetry readings and such... from where i'm sitting,
that's the least of it...

out for today, i guess...

best,

joe

Thanks for the responses to "Cid" on the list and backchannel.  That's
Cid Corman of course.  A bit of an update from what I know: Cid's
younger sister is presently involved in writing a biography that will
extend through the late 1960's, ending roughly in 1971 or so.
Shizumi's dream is to continue living in the house she shared with Cid
in Kyoto, and to turn it into a museum dedicated to him.  Almost
everything--all of Cid's mss., letters, proofs, books and photographs
are in the hands of Richard Aaron, who is in the process of selling the
material to a major university.  Just came across a postcard from Cid in
an old book--he's still talking to me--and the dialogue continues.

Hi everyone,

I'm doing a story/review of Narrow House Recordings, an audio poetry label,=
 and I'm trying to convince myself of the positives and negatives of such a=
 thing.

Some problems which exist for me right now are

the throwing around of the word 'Avant Garde' as a term to group its contri=
butors rather than as a process of the contributor's doing, i.e. 'doing' ph=
ilosophy instead of being grouped as a 'philosopher'

and

the many labels that it throws around on its website (political/contemporar=
y/avant garde) is it necessary to throw these terms around if writing is, i=
n fact, a political action/politically motivared? and contemporary? I mean,=
 he's not recording Whitman or Pound.

and

if such a thing as 'avant garde' can be used to 'describe' a label, how imp=
ortant is regionalism (in this case Baltimore, which is not exactly at the =
helm of the avant garde nor any other literary subdivision)? the proprietor=
 in fact says he's not interested in regionalism but my point is that an av=
ant garde is at the fringe because it chooses to represent those fringe ele=
ments. by recording folks like rod smith, anselm berrigan, laura elrick, kr=
isten prevallet, etc. i'd say it was, in general, representing the big pict=
ure (the STARS of the avant garde), but wouldn't it be or isn't it far more=
 crucial to bring to light those elements (Baltimore Poets) that might be l=
ost under such a spot light? He does in fact have recordings of himself and=
 another Baltimorean, but I gathered from him it was necessary to provide t=
he world with a fringe medium (recordings of readers and readings) rather t=
han the elements themselves.

Any opinions? This is a fairly new medium for myself...=20

Found Poem: Kissing a Nun

A nun flags down a cab
gets in, and the cab driver
won't stop staring.

"Why are you staring, my son?"

He replies: "I have a question to ask,
but I don't want to offend you".

"You cannot offend me;
If you=92d been a nun as long as I have
can be sure of that!"

Still the cabbie hesitates and then blurts
"I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me."

"Well, let's see what we can do about that",
the nun responds.
Are you single and Catholic?"

The cab driver excitedly responds,
"Yes, I'm single and Catholic!"

"OK", the nun says, "pull into the next alley."
The nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss
that would make a courtesan blush.

When they get back on the road, though,
the cab driver starts crying.

"My dear child," said the nun, why are you crying?"

"Forgive me but I've sinned.
I lied -- I'm married and I'm Jewish."

The nun says, "That's OK,
my name is Kevin,
and I'm going to a Halloween party."

Steve:

Banning alcohol in bars is an excellent idea. Then no one will go to them,
and there won't be a smoking problem. This is known as: throwing the drunk
out on his butt.

They are intending to ban smoking in all pubs (bars) in New Zealand in a few
months I think.

When I was in NY in 1993 the place was marvelous but frightening and to keep
sane I was drunk every night! In fact I remember having a 1/2 dozen beers in
the lower East Side just to attend a reading of "When the Sun Tries to Go
On" (which was organised by Jordan Davies - people took turns reading)  and
I was very drunk at the Nuyorican and other places I went to...

I dont smoke but I used to be contemptious of people who didnt drink or
smoke...or tolerate same...

But (I also) dont go to bars much now (I went thru a  long period of
drinking and reading and I would drive home very very drunk - was caught
about 4 times by the cops - lost my licence twice (for about 6 months each
time I think) and incurred heavy fines - but I was very popular as a
reader - people would come only to hear me week after week   - but when I
stopped (or slowed my drinking slowed the drinkng the "oomph" went out of my
performances etc) I remember in the early 90s when I started reading/writing
etc that there were people comnplained of smoke etc about I thought they
were  just "wowsers"  ( moaners and non-drinkers) ...but one changes ( I
coincidentally read Montainge's essay on Inconstancy this morning!) and
apart from the danger and the terrible hangovers, the cost and post-drink
depression and terrible anxiety I have found that since I have limited (now
I am considering not going to bars at all again) my drinking to say one
drink in a night or three at the most [fortunately I dont drink at home and
I have never smoked - its only when I was/am socialising that thru
nervousness I felt the need to drink] (as opposed to I might have three
bottles before I got the pub (usually apoetry reading venue) then about 8
pints then more drinks in another bar after the reading then I would drive
my car across the city very drunk - by the way one never feels guilty aboout
that (its useless anyway feeling guilty) especially at the time but ADDED to
all that was the horrible smell of smoke in the morning in my clothes  - and
as I say I drink less now so I also now notice that my eyes hurt terribly
from the smoke.

 All that said it is this - part of me agrees with the smoking ban - in NYC
and in NZ but the rebellious part of me ((Montainge speculates (or quotes)
"Man" is so changeable he (is believed) to have two souls - implying he
could love smoking if he wason a date with a beautiful woman who smoked and
drank and find tehexperience divine - but as he got older and a bit
bronchial come to hate all smokers !! ))

What this debate is about is personal freedom versus the public good - the
old dilemma - the freedom to be crazy and rambunctious or"swashbuckling" and
"mad" versus the perceived "goody goodies" and the neeed to be responsible
and survive etc and be concerned for asthmatics, potential caner vitcims etc
etc    When I was reading (always drunk) I couldnt understand people who
just had one or two beers -or none !!
But we change (out of fear or wisdom I know not - he Montainges)

This debate will get omore responses than a close reading of Creeley or
Cunnning s poem !!

What would NY - without the legend of NY be without memories of Jackson
Pollock,David Smith,D Thomas, Delmore Schwarz, Harry Nudel, Frank O' Hara
(did he drink much?), Keroauc etc..all the drugs and drinkgng  - he artists
and the pop stars etc etc.....the "weirdos" and so on..what would the world
be??

Ironically when I was young I didnt drink much - mainly just drank grape
juice.   (Jugoslav builder to me" But what do you do to getta  crazy??!!" )

Now I am happily sober and away from smoke.  i dont see the need to go to
poetry readings - now I just read poems in books (occasionally go to
readings etc ..but very rarely go)   ...poetry reading organisers will lose
smokers - and reformed biungers such as myself - but bring back those who
are afffected by or hate smoke so what you win on the roudabouts you
lose......

Influential BBC Radio DJ John Peel Dies
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Published: October 26, 2004


Filed at 2:09 p.m. ET

LONDON (AP) -- John Peel, a longtime British Broadcasting Corp. disc jockey
whose enthusiasm for the offbeat, the eclectic and the obscure launched the
careers of dozens of bands, has died, the BBC said Tuesday. He was 65.

The broadcaster said Peel suffered a heart attack Monday while vacationing
in Peru with his wife, Sheila.

Dr. Alcides Vargas, who worked to revive Peel, told Peru's Radioprogramas
radio that the DJ suffered a heart attack in a hotel in Cuzco, 350 miles
southeast of the Peruvian capital, Lima. He was pronounced dead on the way
to a clinic.

Peel's program on Radio 1, the BBC's flagship pop music station, exerted a
huge influence for more than 30 years. He was often the first to play demo
tapes by little-known bands, and his enthusiasm propelled some to fame.

Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said Blair -- who once played
guitar in a college band called Ugly Rumours -- was ``genuinely saddened''
by the news.

He said Peel ``was a unique voice in British broadcasting who used that
voice to unearth new talent and different subjects and bring them to the
awareness and make them accessible to a much wider audience.''

Peel promoted reggae, hip-hop and punk on the sometimes conservative BBC,
and championed acts ranging from Jimi Hendrix and David Bowie to The Smiths,
The Fall, Pulp and Northern Irish punks The Undertones, whose ``Teenage
Kicks'' Peel rated his favorite song.

His live studio sessions were coveted by bands, and many were released on
record as the ``Peel Sessions.''

``Over the years we've had almost everybody, except The Beatles and the
Rolling Stones, of the kind of big bands of the past,'' Peel once told an
interviewer. ``More recently Oasis -- I never really thought Oasis were much
good, to be honest, so they didn't do one.''

Bands Peel did like, such as post-punk outfit Joy Division and its
successor, New Order, often remained deeply grateful

``If it wasn't for John Peel, there would be no Joy Division and no New
Order,'' band member Bernard Sumner said. ``He was one of the few people to
give bands that played alternative music a chance to get heard, and he
continued to be a champion of cutting-edge music throughout his life.''

Blur frontman Damon Albarn said, ``John Peel's patronage was for me, like
countless other musicians, one of the most significant things that happened
to us in our careers.''

Pulp's Jarvis Cocker said Peel ``was one of those few people about whom you
could truly say that the world would have been a much different place
without him. For many years he almost single-handedly championed new and
challenging music in the U.K.''

Elvis Costello called Peel ``a great man, a fabulous curmudgeon -- he was as
rare as the music that he loved.''

Guy Garvey, frontman of Manchester band Elbow, said: ``We owe him
everything.

``He was the first person to ever play us on the radio, which I am sure lots
of people can say.''

Peel was born John Ravenscroft near Liverpool in 1939. As a teenager, he
later said, his life was changed by hearing Elvis Presley singing
``Heartbreak Hotel.'' He later joined the British army and worked in a
cotton mill.

In the early 1960s he moved to Dallas, where his roots in Liverpool -- newly
famous as home of The Beatles -- enabled him to get a job on WRR radio,
hosting a program called ``Kat's Karavan.'' He then worked at stations in
Oklahoma City and San Bernardino, Calif.

Returning to Britain, he worked on the pirate station Radio London,
broadcasting from a boat off the English coast, where he adopted the name
John Peel.

He joined the BBC in 1967, broadcasting on Radio 1 and internationally on
the World Service. Since 1998, he also presented ``Home Truths,'' a
whimsical show about the travails of family life, on the BBC's talk-based
Radio 4.

He is survived by his wife and four children. Funeral details were not
immediately announced.

Would be really neat to hear that nearly every poet, critic, academic on =
the Buf List got a couple hundred dollars together and got over to Ohio =
(or at least Pennsylvania) and put some time in Getting out the Vote.

Actually, Pennsylvania looks pretty good right now.  I was down there in =
Erie this weekend canvassing and ran into a fellow who had travelled =
over from Philadelphia.  He gave this "inside information," which sounds =
pretty darn good: "Philly usually sees the city voting strong for the =
Democrat candidate and the suburbs voting strong for the Repukelican =
candidate.  However, our polling and surveys are showing the Philly =
suburbs leaning 3 to 2 for Kerry/Edwards versus Chimpwreck.  In =
addition, and I got this from the head Republican campaign chair talking =
to my brother in Philly area, the Repukes have all but given up on PA =
weeks ago.  Only reason Bush is still making trips here is to drum up =
campaign monies and support local candidates."  Well, that's what the =
fella told me, Listees.  Of course, it's only grapevine rumor, but it's =
heartening, nonetheless.

The real gem, IMHO, will be OHIO.  Here is one of several groups folks =
can hook up with: America Coming Together,=20

*       Your contribution of $100, $50, or even $25 right now will turn out =

<http://contribute.actforvictory.org/> =20

*=09
By volunteering with ACT next Tuesday, you'll personally help voters get =
to the polls.  Sign up to volunteer today. <http://acthere.com/>

Now, most poets don't have a lot of money to put into things like =
elections, but just about anybody can call in sick next Monday and =
Tuesday and get over to Cleveland, or someplace vital, and do the =
non-glamorous, non-career poet enhancing, nitty-gritty work of getting =
Chimpopath removed from office.  (Ain't any "writing" or "poetry" that's =
going to much affect this election -- we mostly write to/for elite =
others and at best there's some "trickle-down" effect, but ya all know =
the score on that note.) =20


Blah blah, but if ya get to Cleveland, I hope to run into ya and say =
Hello.

Peace, Love, Fun, etc.

Web Server Takedown Called Speech Threat

Tue Oct 26, 3:05 PM ET

By ELLEN SIMON, AP Technology Writer

Devin Theriot-Orr, a member a feisty group of reporter-activists called
Indymedia, was surprised when two FBI (news - web sites) agents showed up a=
t
his Seattle law office, saying the visit was a "courtesy call" on behalf of
Swiss authorities.=20



Theriot-Orr was even more surprised a week later when more than 20 Indymedi=
a
Web sites were knocked offline as the computer servers that hosted them wer=
e
seized in Britain.=20


The Independent Media Center, more commonly known as Indymedia, says the
seizure is tantamount to censorship, and civil libertarians agree. The
Internet is a publishing medium just like a printing press, they argue, and

J. Edgar Hoover's Ghost Hovers Closely, In Fact:

Web Server Takedown Called Speech Threat

Tue Oct 26, 3:05 PM ET

By ELLEN SIMON, AP Technology Writer

Devin Theriot-Orr, a member a feisty group of reporter-activists called
Indymedia, was surprised when two FBI (news - web sites) agents showed up at
his Seattle law office, saying the visit was a "courtesy call" on behalf of
Swiss authorities.



Theriot-Orr was even more surprised a week later when more than 20 Indymedia
Web sites were knocked offline as the computer servers that hosted them were
seized in Britain.


The Independent Media Center, more commonly known as Indymedia, says the
seizure is tantamount to censorship, and civil libertarians agree. The
Internet is a publishing medium just like a printing press, they argue, and
governments have no right to remove Web sites.


The case, which involves an Internet company based in Texas, photos of
undercover Swiss police officers and a request from an Italian prosecutor
investigating anarchists, raises questions about the circumstances under
which Internet companies can be compelled to turn over data.

a big, shiny, new espresso machine and some nice, comfy chairs and couches

ANNOUNCEMENT:

The Modern Poetics Program at the University of Notre Dame wishes to
announce an
upcoming event free and open to the public: "TEXTSOUNDS: a
mini-conference" will
take place in the campus's brand new Center for the Performing Arts from
November 18th through the 20th.  Organized by Romana Huk, Gerald Bruns
and
Stephen Fredman, these three days of lectures, performances and
audience-driven
discussion will focus on the work of Steve McCaffery, Caroline
Bergvall, cris
cheek and Charles Bernstein.  It will open with a lecture by Marjorie
Perloff
(5 pm, Nov. 18th) and its ensuing discussions will be led by both
Perloff and
the Program's December visiting-lecturer, Joan Retallack.  These two
days of
events will involve the poets in what at Notre Dame we are archiving and
calling "pedagogical performances," or ones that slowly unfold over the
course
of an hour with interpolated explanation and/or history of the artist's
developing project.  Substantial discussion-time with our students and
faculty
are planned after each session, and lengthy sessions devoted to papers
and
other kinds of prose interventions by the poets are scheduled for the
late
afternoons of the 19th and 20th.  On the 19th, NDCinema has planned a
night of
avant-garde film shorts with pieces by 20th-C figures from Duchamp to
Brakhage/Cage to Henry Hills; on the 20th, we will have a night of
performances
open to the public.  Both of the evening events require a small fee of
6 dollars
for visitors from outside the Notre Dame community.  Most of the above
takes
place in the 100-seater black box theater in the PAC.  Please contact
Romana
Huk on huk.1@nd.edu if you would like to attend and have questions about
accommodations in town.  As seating is so limited, it is important that
you let
us know of your plans so that we can set aside space for you.  Further
information will be available by November 5th on either of two
university
websites: www.nd.edu/~english or performingarts.nd.edu.

Perhaps I should add, even though I have no connection to the event aside
from the fact that I'll be there, that Eric and Noah will be reading
tomorrow night (10.27/ p.m. ~) at Prairie Lights Bookstore in Iowa City.

Love to meet any other listees (or off-listees) there.

The death of a small wasp

How wonderful the work of Nature is!
I looked at the tiny wasp through an antique microscope.
The wasp was our pet.
It lived with us for several weeks.
Then one day, it died, of natural causes.
The bristles are perfectly arranged on the legs.
The lenses are crisp and beautiful, the eyes! the eyes!
Everything is as it should be.
Such structures! Such configurations!
The wasp is thread-wasted and quite small.
I will pray for the wasp.
Such perfect design, such eloquence!
Nothing is happening here, nothing, nothing!
It is all useless, it didn't multiply, emptied.

And the World is emptied of meaning.
And we are the hard-scrabble savanna primates who did it.
Before us! Everything little thing!
Inconceivable structures, amazing configurations!
Now, nothing corrodes, nothing coheres.
We violate the universe, we slaughter!

I believe nothing, I will pray for the wasp!
I will pray for the wasp!

Christophe asked:
..|  ...(political/contemporary/avant garde) is
..|  it necessary to throw these terms around...?
[...]
..| ...wouldn't it be or isn't it far more crucial
..|  to bring to light those elements (Baltimore Poets)
..|  that might be lost under such a spot light?


Whomever began linking identity with categorical terms has done a great
disservice to everyone. I find this categorical zeal absurd in our
current information age. Indeed the whole American experience teaches us
to uplift the individual and abandon the regimental. Somewhere between
Whitman through today a cruel reversal has been allowed to take place.
Former victories have been conceded it seems, or at least obfuscated,
possibly tossed away.

Why post-avant, post-post, New York School this, Black Mountain that,
anything? All this posturing implies is hyperbole to suggest that one
has 'arrived' -and- that they are unwilling to deal with particulars.
Indeed, one is not a woman it seems until she is included in a 'Woman's'
anthology, for instance. I would suggest either an experience agrees
with our nature or it does not -- that we do not need the security of
extrinsic denomination. At one point in history, America, I believe, had
moved beyond this paranoia and became autonomous. But something has
brought artificial character back to the forefront and eclipsed the
simplest notion that an individual could identify with themself. Instead
identity is fanatically lauded as the exclusive property of external
category (label) and forever are people everywhere diminished and led to
believe themselves useless until they acquire burlesque ornamentation.
It seems to be a clandestine age.

Hi Murat and List People

Thanks for bothering to scan my trivia....

I got onto Montaigne first reading something about Barthes (it was pointed
out that the French study him (Montaigne and rigorously write essays etc of
course Montaigne invented the essay) AND I picked up Great Books by Denby
which is actually about the debate  - the "canon" debate etc (although Denby
isnt in Barthes league (or is he?) etc its a fascinating book - he goes back
to Columbia Uni at the age of 48 or so and does the same course (which he
didnt do very thoroughly first time round) of all the so-called great
books - the interest is in his own anecdotes,the diff betwixt the late 60s
ands and the 90s,  in the lectures (their substance and the questions and
variosu crises in class), and in the subject matter and the debate that some
times arose by students (especially black re Eurocentrism etc);::: but when
it comes to Montaigne, the Lecturer (real person, real lecturer - the
students names only are suppressed ) tells them (something like): "You are
about to lose your life" and goes on to explain (or they read a number of
the essays first) that Montaigne had a strategy or a way of shifting his
postions , maybe knew there wer no certain fixed positions or they were hard
to find(he is almost a postmodernist  in this) -

but you are right (and anyone who hasnt read Montaingne should do so, I
certainly have read all his essays) - at one level he does console: I have
been reading some Barthes and bits and pieces of other such and I find him
also strangely "consoling" as well as stimulating etc - as I get older, like
him, like M I mean (and maybe like Barthes although he didnt live so long) I
am faced more and more with myself.

 I dont think is essays made him famous or if he was even known much...but
he started a great tradition - one thinks of Huxley, Nick Piombino's
Hazlitt, Emerson and many others,  (Nick found /finds Hazlitt
consoling/stimulating)( Nick's poems are like essays of a kind i think) and
Montaigne, like myself, wonderfully digresses and wanders: he also
influenced Shaespeare - and one sees ideas or influences that maybe are at
work in the bard's plays/poetry - even via or in that essay I read on
Inconstancy (eg in Shakespear's "darker" poems (my thesis is that Bill was a
nihilist or close to that - but he was also inconstant as the moon!!))..the
slippage was perhaps there already prefigured in Montaigne and others (and
Bill and Ben later) ...

I have also been "catching up" with the classics (I rely on translations)
and Ovid 's Metamorphoses I found wonderful to read (I came to him via
making my way though the Cantos with the aid of a crib - Pound has marvelous
translations/adaptations of Ovid - and )....

I actually woke early and felt a bit down, just a little, (like harry 'drn'
nudel maybe who 'dug the dark all night' (words to that effect) and felt a
need to read an essayof M. So I plan to read one a day....

Richard.

Looking for advice:
I'm teaching a course on confession/autobiographical poets
ginsberg and plath, and interested to hear what poems people
recommend from each poet, particularly of poems that
foreground the kind of provocation of other and abjection of
self other than the obvious poems (like
AG's "Howl," "Kaddish," "America"), and SP's Ariel).  Are
there early poems by Plath, and middle/later poems by
Ginsberg, that you would consider important?

Thanks.  Email offlist if necessary,

just a heads-up to say that the new issue of 88 is fab, as per,

Stonechild investigation flawed: inquiry

SASKATOON - The original investigation by Saskatoon police into the
death of 17-year-old Neil Stonechild was "superficial and totally
inadequate," according to the final report of a provincial inquiry
released Tuesday.

In his final report, Justice David Wright concluded there's evidence
that Stonechild, who was found frozen to death in a field on the
outskirts of Saskatoon in 1990, was in police custody the night he was
last seen alive. Marks on his body were likely caused by handcuffs, the
judge found.

[Neil Stonechild autopsy photo, showing nose cuts that correspond with
the dimensions of police handcuffs.]

"As I reviewed the evidence in this inquiry, I was reminded again and
again of the chasm that separates aboriginal and non-aboriginal people
in this city and province," the commissioner wrote. "The deficiencies in
the investigation go beyond incompetence or neglect. They were
inexcusable."

Stonechild's body was discovered five days after a friend said he saw
him sitting in the back of a police cruiser, bloodied and calling for help.

The original Saskatoon police investigation in 1991 was brief. It
concluded the aboriginal teenager died while trying to walk to an adult
jail to turn himself in for being at large from a youth home.

Police claimed they had no contact with Stonechild the night he
disappeared.

The case was largely forgotten by many for a decade - until two
aboriginal men were found frozen to death in a field on the outskirts of
Saskatoon within a week in 2000.

A third man survived and told a tale of being driven to the field by
Saskatoon police officers, who left him there to find his way back to
the city.

Saskatchewan's justice minister asked the RCMP to reopen the
investigation into Stonechild's death.

That investigation concluded there was not enough evidence to lay
charges. However, accusations that police abandoned him sparked the
provincial inquiry into the teenager's death and how the subsequent
investigation was handled.

At the inquiry, two Saskatoon police officers implicated in the case
denied even seeing Stonechild the night he disappeared. However,
Stonechild's friend, Jason Roy, testified that he saw a terrified
Stonechild in the back of a police cruiser the night he vanished.

Autopsy photos of Stonechild's body showed marks across his face that
correspond to the shape of a handcuff.

Wright's report concludes that the two Saskatoon police officers -
constables Larry Hartwig and Brad Senger - did respond to a call
involving Stonechild the night he was last seen alive and took him into
custody.

Wright also chastises Sgt. Keith Jarvis, the officer in charge of the
initial investigation, for dismissing important information about the
case, such as Roy's report that he saw Stonechild in the back of police
cruiser the night he disappeared.

The inquiry's report makes eight recommendations including:

* Attracting more aboriginal candidates to municipal police services in
Saskatchewan.
* Making it easier to complain about inappropriate behaviour by police.
* Better in-depth training on race relations for police officers.
* Review the anger management and dispute resolution courses police
officers take.

The $2-million inquiry heard from 43 witnesses over 64 days of hearings,
which wrapped up last May.

Justice minister apologizes

Releasing the report Tuesday, Frank Quennell, Saskatchewan's justice
minister, extended his sympathy to Stonechild's family and promised to
act on Wright's recommendations.

Grim-faced, Quennell told a news conference: "We cannot accept a society
in which the most vulnerable people in our community are not able to
turn for help to those entrusted with protecting them. I do not accept
that situation. The government of this province does not accept that
situation. The death of a 17-year-old boy is a tragedy. It deserves our
attention. It deserves our very best efforts."

However, he said Crown prosecutors have determined there is not enough
evidence to lay criminal charges against the police constables involved
in Stonechild's disappearance.

Mother will push for charges

The youth's mother, Stella Bignell, said she accepted Quennell's apology
but will still push for charges to be laid. She said she feels sure that
will happen someday.

"I have faith. I have faith that's as strong as a mountain," she said.
"I prayed all the time that justice would be brought out."

Bignell wouldn't answer questions about whether she is considering a
lawsuit over her son's death.

At the moment, she said, all she wants are apologies from the two
constables, the Saskatoon police chief and the officers blamed for the
poor investigation.

"They took my son out. They took my son away from me," she said,
fighting tears. "They didn't investigate, even though I asked them to."

I smoked for years and now I don't. But I've been amazed at the
juvenilia that has spurted forth over this topic.

People who think that smoking is about ANYTHING other than turning your
cardiovascular system over to the worst corporations in America have
been watching way too many advertisements. It has nothing to do with
pleasure or communion, only to do with addiction & profit margins. It's
William Burroughs' vision of capitalism at its most pure.

People who put reading series on in places that permit smoking generally
show that they're not putting their I.Q.s to work or that there are
desperately few venues open to a crowd of poets.

I generally steer clear of reading series in bars -- like La Tazza here
in Philly -- precisely because of the smoke. Why do I need to have a
headache the entire next day just to hear 30 minutes of poetry?

As data on second-hand smoke shows, smoking is of a different -- more
virulent -- order than, say, drinking or gun ownership. It is one thing
to own a gun, another to shoot randomly into crowds. Smoking is very
much like shooting randomly into crowds.

Seance

a 2 day public meditation on the condition of
language and narrative in contemporary writing.

OCTOBER 29 & 30, 2004, at REDCAT, The Roy and Edna Disney CalArts
Theater in downtown Los Angeles.

Our S=E9ance in Experimental Writing gathers new and established
writers to speculate on the boundaries of structural and linguistic
experiments today. Participants include novelists, short-story
writers, poets, and hypertextualists, from Canada, the US, and
Europe: Dodie Bellamy, Charles Bernstein, Jaap Blonk, Christian Bok,
Dennis Cooper, Madeline Gins, Robert Gluck, Kenneth Goldsmith,
Shelley Jackson, Kevin Killian, Derek McCormack, Ben Marcus, Tracie
Morris, Eileen Myles, Joan Retallack, Cristina Rivera Garza, Steven
Shaviro, Janet Sternburg, and Lidia Yuknavitch. The panels are:

Pataphysics: Science, Fiction and Imaginary Solutions.  Fiction often
proposes imaginary solutions to problems that vex both the social and
the scientific world.  For every rule there seems to be an exception,
and to every episteme an extreme.  Imagine the impossible.  Can the
world be re-written?  If science is metaphysical is poetry a form of
math?

Egoplasm: The Ghost of the Author Returns.  Even though the author is
dead, anyone can tell the difference between a poem by Jackson  Mac
Low and Steve McCaffery.  Is the writing machine always haunted by
its author? Need it bear repeating that just when women and non-white
writers establish their literary self, straight white men declare to
them that the subject is dead.  Can the author really be made to
disappear?  Should he or she disappear?  Are new subjectivities being
created?

What's love got to do with it? Sex & Desire in Narrative.  For more
than a generation, sex and sexual desire have been the sine qua non
of experimental writing.  Is desire still relevant?  Is sex obsolete?
Can lust create identity? Do readers want to be aroused and can
writers still arouse them? Why has the urgency of the human body been
so fertile for writers, and where will this excitement lead us next?

Ethernity - to Infinity and Beyond!  From the chemistry of letters to
the double-helix and the periodic table of elements. Is there
structure beyond structuralism?  Are structures of language and
narrative more real than 'reality'? Do extreme patterns lead away
from or toward paranoia?  Intricate lattices of poetry:  the inter-,
meta-, pata-, and the trans-.

Absolutely Ordinary: Writing the Everyday.  To the ontological
question 'what is there?' the usual answer is: the desk, my chair,
the air, the past=8A everything.  Writers have a dual relation to the
everyday.  It is everywhere, in their work and in its making, yet is
also always evades them.  From Flaubert's housewife's fantasies to
Kenneth Goldsmith's transcription of every movement in his day, the
everyday never goes away. What is quotidian today?  Is there a secret
life of objects? How do/ can/ will writers represent the ordinary?

Agree completely with Ron, except to add that the smokers' gun fires
backwards too, and wounds the shooter. If only all guns would do the same

I used to smoke heavily - till 75 - and really resented it when people
objected to my smoking in their houses or cars. What was their problem?
asked the idiot who had grown up in a smoking house. I now realise my
response was that of an addict.

Sub Voicive Poetry was a smoking venue, without consideration of the issue,
from its inception in 1980. Around 1990, a vote was taken of regulars; and
it was agreed that SVP would henceforth be non-smoking. Then for some
reason, nothing happened; and people went on smoking.

Some time in 1994, when I was chairing, I suggested that we implement the
ban; everyone agreed and that's been that. Occasionally people start to
smoke and then, when they are told, look quite shamefaced.. It's only been a
problem once. The offender was drunk at the time: he refused to comply; then
complied and later apologised.

Since then, every SVP event, whatever it is, has been non-smoking without
demur. Readings hardly ever go more than 45 minutes or colloquium sessions
more than 90 without a break for bodily needs.

This enables non smokers to attend the events without fear of damaging their
lungs and smokers to attend with only a  minimal interruption to their
suicide

There was an odd item on the radio today. About the idea of banning scent.
It included an unscientific vox pop in which one said that some scents, if
he shared an elevator with them, made him vomit; but he wouldn't restrict
such chemicals because it is everyone's right to wear scent.

And I wondered what he was talking about. What right? Would he recognise the
right of a violent person to beat him up in an elevator?

NB Should have mentioned that SVP has always exempted the reader from the
ban, not wanting to do anything to throw poets off their performance best;
but few smoker-readers have chosen to smoke as they read

I seem to find myself on both sides of the fence, although that's nothing
new.

To me, smoke and liquor go together in bars. In jazz clubs, marijuana should
be a complementary gift; it's been part of the music's subculture since
Louis Armstrong. But I rarely smoke tobacco anymore, stopped drinking in
1986 and discovered 10 years ago that I stopped liking bars as social
environments. Since I don't go to them, it's not a matter that concerns me
any longer. It's too bad smokers couldn't have some places and nonsmokers
others. My wife has asthma, so my stepson smokes his cigarettes in my room
when he visits; having been addicted to them, I understand the need. Because
of my off-again on-again patterns I can identify with both sides. I don't
like people smoking near me when I'm eating, but I tolerate it if I have to.


The carnivore vs. herbivore debate seems overly problematic. Picky, picky,
picky!  My wife and I have no problem preparing vegetarian meals for our
vegetarian friends---except that they violate their principles and surprise
us by eating steak, despite being surrounded by the food they like. That's
OK, we like it too and have it as leftovers.

Maybe herbivores & carnivores would have an easier time socializing if they
just went to a restaurant. And it's a less suitable environment for a food
fight, should culinary differences become heated.

Josey Wales: That's true. I ain't promising you nothing extra. I'm just
giving you life and you're giving me life. And I'm saying that men can live
together without butchering one another.


Ten Bears: It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double-tongues. There
is iron in your word of death for all Comanche to see. And so there is iron
in your words of life. No signed paper can hold the iron, it must come from
men. The words of Ten Bears carries the same iron of life and death. It is good
that warriors such as we meet in the struggle of life ... or death. It shall be
life.
----------

Our language concerns itself with death. We should define poetry as its
etymology insists, creation, making. Which words create and sustain life? If
innovation in poetry fails to meet this demand, what is its point? Where is its life
enabling language:

in the mist we all recline
in the wetness of design
in the motion of the trance
let go the answer in the dance

----------

Perhaps W.H. Auden recognized the absence of such power and could only
encourage the poet to follow W.B. Yeats - "Follow poet, follow right ..."

to laugh out the screaming wind
to praise this present pain
to categorize the end
to epitomize the rain
to sanctify the lowborn
to orchestrate existence
to reanimate the forlorn
to emblazon human resistance
insatiable hope scales the heights
to see the eagle eye to eye
and tries through lie racked desolate nights
to sing the wings in words and fly

Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer:

INTEGRAL MUSIC

Languages of African American Innovation

Aldon Lynn Nielsen



An important study of African American contributions to contemporary
American poetry.



"A stunning performance! . . . Aldon Nielsen's work reminds one of how
adventuresome and delightful an experience reading can be. His criticism
offers fresh perspectives informed by a wide range of contextual data.
Presented with wit and clarity, Dr. Nielsen's commentary sends readers
back to the literary works he analyzes with renewed enthusiasm and
broadened horizons."--Lorenzo Thomas, author of Extraordinary Measures:
Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry



Aldon Nielsen's book Black Chant: Languages of African American
Postmodernism was a ground-breaking work of scholarship that examined
modern and postmodern developments in the work of African American poets
since the Second World War and their contributions to both African
American culture and American modernism.



Integral Music extends the terms of the studies begun in Black Chant
through a more in-depth look at the work of key writers and poets in the
decades following the Second World War. While Nielsen examines anew such
key figures as Amiri Baraka, he also provides the first extended studies
of significant but often overlooked figures in African American poetry,
such as Russell Atkins and Stephen Jonas. His essay on Bob Kaufman
points toward the critical intersection of poetry and jazz in African
American letters, as does his essay on performance poet Jayne Cortez.



Nielsen's studies in this volume affirm the importance and centrality of
African American poets to American intellectual life and international,
modernist, and postmodernist poetry today.



Aldon Lynn Nielsen is Kelly Professor of American Literature at
Pennsylvania State University and author of several books, including
Reading Race.

Yes, R.S., down with the romance of smoking, I'm glad
*I've* never smoked, but then again, I liked the way
(a while ago, on your blog)you explicated the alluring
phrase "small fires" in a classic John Wieners poem as
referring to lit-up cigarettes.

lawrence upton's post nicely summarizes what i think of as the
general coming-of-age about smoking, here on the north american
continent and elsewhere (if not everywhere, sadly)... as i said in a
prior post, maybe we're ready, collectively, to understand such
things...

my father died from (among other such abuses) smoking himself to
death... i don't see anything romantic about it, and have always
found it a nasty habit... if i still go back & forth on the matter,
it's simply b/c i'm trying not to sound too, what, paternal... and
maybe i'm trying not to lose my past, i suppose... but again, i, too,
have some strong opines about what does and does not constitute
proper public conduct... took me a long time, coming from where i'm
coming from, to understand the simple legitimacy of being a
vegetarian... again, some of my best friends now etc... but you saw
none of that in the neighborhoods in which i was raised...

hey, i'm doing the best i can...

at the same time, i'm coming full circle in saying that i see more
clearly now that some  choices, while entirely reasonable or even
preferable, stem from economic class access (to alternative thought,
practice, and so forth)... so while i frown on smoking, and while
i've nothing against vegetarians, i do get annoyed when i find
ourselves dividing our preferences up to the point at which a simple
get-together is a problem... it was even a problem for us
carnivores... i remember distinctly the time when the "guys" i hung
around with for so long all started having girlfriends (please
forgive me this rhetoric), and a simple bbq/picnic---hotdogs and
hamburgs---had suddenly to include chicken and veggies and and and...

hey, i had to grow up, i know... but it made for a more complicated
affair... so i suppose we're living during more complicated times in
this regard, and this is a good thing... but good things have their
complications...

best,

joe

As someone who is having their IQ called into question (thanks Ron), let me
talk a little about my plot to murder poets with second-hand smoke. I call
this plot the La Tazza Reading Series.

The series takes place in a bar. Bars in Philadelphia permit smoking ( for
now). The prior manifestation of the series held readings in the Highwire
Gallery. The gallery was too cold in the winter & too hot in the spring.
Guess what? People bitched about that too. The audience brought their own
alcohol to the readings, & once the readings were over, they ran out of
there like teenagers from church. Where did they run to? Bars.

The idea behind holding the series in a bar (which, BTW- La Tazza has been
more accomadating & encouraging than any venue I know of. They're glad to
have us!) was to keep the crowd together, encourage conversation (as opposed
to just networking) & promote community. And it's worked.

Ron, did you have an IQ lapse for all those years you were sucking on
cigarettes? Did you get a brain surge & decide to quit smoking? Are you
telling me you weren't aware what smoking did to your own lungs? That info's
been common knowledge for a long, long time.

I don't think you had a brain surge. I think you were always a smart guy, &
you were young once. You got older & did the sensible thing. You quit
smoking. I don't consider smoking my idea of pleasure or communion either. I
have asthma & I don't smoke. And of course, cigarette addiction is one of
the ugliest examples of capitalism out of control.

But that's what alot of younger poets like to do. They gather in places to
drink & smoke & talk. It's just the way it is. If smoking is banned in
Philly bars tomorrow, I'm sure the series will survive. I'm guessing that
someday most of the murderers/poets that are smoking like stacks will mature
& do the right thing. They will do what you did & quit smoking.

If I die as a result of the 30ish hours a YEAR(!) I spend inhaling
second-hand smoke in La Tazza, I've heard some amazing readings, had some
unforgettable conversations & made really great friends.

Yours in IQ deficiency (duh),

Frank Sherlock

By state law there is no smoking in the workplace in Massachusetts. The logic is
simple. The long-term costs to society are clear. Business didn't fall of. It
picked up. It turns out that more people stay away from bars because of smoke
than avoid them if they can't.

Hi, Philip.

I taught The Colossus in my poetic technique last
summer, and students responded very well to this work.
 I also showed scenes from the movie Sylvia (ok, this
is Hollywood, but still) so that students could make a
connection between scenes from the movie and the work
they read.

By the way, the scene in which Sylvia, Ted, and a
couple of friends declaim poems going faster and
faster was a hit (but this does not have much to do
with the focus of your course)!  I hope this helps.

I smoked for years and now I don't. But I've been amazed at the
juvenilia that has spurted forth over this topic.

People who think that smoking is about ANYTHING other than turning your
cardiovascular system over to the worst corporations in America have
been watching way too many advertisements. It has nothing to do with
pleasure or communion, only to do with addiction & profit margins. It's
William Burroughs' vision of capitalism at its most pure.

People who put reading series on in places that permit smoking generally
show that they're not putting their I.Q.s to work or that there are
desperately few venues open to a crowd of poets.

I generally steer clear of reading series in bars -- like La Tazza here
in Philly -- precisely because of the smoke. Why do I need to have a
headache the entire next day just to hear 30 minutes of poetry?

As data on second-hand smoke shows, smoking is of a different -- more
virulent -- order than, say, drinking or gun ownership. It is one thing
to own a gun, another to shoot randomly into crowds. Smoking is very
much like shooting randomly into crowds.

Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Freedom is on the March

                           Eliot Weinberger


Among the things the second term of the Bush junta will bring is the
New Freedom Initiative. This is a proposal, barely reported in the
press, to give all Americans- beginning with school children- a
standardized test for mental illness. Those who flunk the test will
be issued medication, and those who do not want to take their
medication will be urged to have it implanted under their skin.
Needless to say, the New Freedom commission, appointed by
the President, is composed almost entirely of executives, lawyers,
and lobbyists for pharmaceutical corporations.

   The question is: Will anyone pass the test? Half of America is
clearly deranged, and it has driven the other half mad.

   The President openly declares that God speaks through him.
The Republicans are making television advertisements featuring
the actor who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the
Christ," while sending out pamphlets that warn that if Kerry is
elected he will ban the Bible. Catholic bishops have decreed that
voting for Kerry is a sin (mortal or venial?) that must be confessed
before one can take communion. The one piece of scientific
research actively promoted by the government is investigating
whether having others pray for you can cure cancer. (The National
Institute of Health has explained that this is "imperative" because
poor people have limited access to normal health care.) At the
official gift shop in Grand Canyon National Park, they sell a book that
states that this so-called natural wonder sprang fully formed in the six
days of Creation. We already know that the current United States
government does not believe in global warming or the hazards of
pollution; now we know it doesn't believe in erosion either.

   The polls are evidence that the country is suffering a collective
head injury. On any given issue-- the economy, the war in Iraq,
health care-- the majority perceive that the situation is bad and
the President has handled it badly. Yet these same people, in
these same polls, also say they'll be voting for Bush. Like a
battered wife-- realizing yet denying what is happening, still
making excuses for their man-- the voters are ruled by fear and
intimidation and the threat of worse to come. They've been
beaten up by the phantom of terrorism.

   Every few weeks we're bludgeoned by warnings that terrorists
may strike in a matter of days. Incited by the Department of
Homeland Security, millions have bought duct tape and plastic
sheeting to protect their homes from biological and chemical attack,
and have amassed caches of canned food and bottled water. To
ensure that everyone everywhere stays afraid, 10,000 FBI agents
have been sent to small towns to talk to local police chiefs about what
they can do to fight terrorism. After the massacre at Beslan, school
principals received letters from the Department of Education instructing
them to beware of strangers.The Vice President intones that if Kerry is
elected, terrorists will be exploding nuclear bombs in the cities. (And,
to anticipate all possibilities, also warns that terrorists may set off
bombs before the election to influence the vote. . . but we're not
going to let them tell Americans who to vote for, are we?)

   Fear has infected even the most common transactions of daily life.
It is not only visitors to the US who are treated as criminals, with
fingerprints and photographs and retinal scans. Anyone entering any
anonymous office building must now go through security clearances
worthy of an audience with Donald Rumsfeld. At the airports, fear of
flying has been replaced by fear of checking-in. Nearly every day there
are stories of people arrested or detained for innocuous activities, like
snapping a photo of a friend in the subway or wearing an antiwar
button  while shopping in the mall. Worst of all, the whole country
has acquiesced to the myth of terrorist omnipotence. Even those who
laugh at the color-coded Alerts and other excesses of the anti-terror
apparatus do not question the need for the apparatus itself. The
Department of Homeland Security, after all, was a Democratic
proposal first rejected by Bush.


Common sense has retreated to the monasteries of a few websites. It is
considered delusional to suggest that international terrorism is nothing
more than a criminal activity performed by a handful of people, that
Al-Qaeda and similar groups are the Weather Underground, the Brigato
Rosso, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, with more sophisticated techniques
and more powerful weapons, operating in the age of hysterical 24-hour
television news. They are not an army. They are not waging a war.
They are tiny groups perpetrating isolated acts of violence.

   There's no question they are dangerous individuals, but- without
demeaning the indelible trauma of 9/11 or the Madrid bombings- the
danger they pose must be seen with some kind of dispassionate
perspective. A terrorist attack is a rare and sudden disaster, the
man-made equivalent of an earthquake or flood. More people die
in the U.S. every year from choking on food than died in the Twin
Towers. About 35,000 die annually from gunshot wounds. (While
Bush lifts the ban on assault weapons, and both Bush and Kerry
promote gun ownership, a captured al-Qaeda manual recommends
traveling to the U.S. to buy weapons.) About 45,000 die in car
crashes-- while the Bush administration lowers automobile safety
standards to increase the profits of the auto industry, major
donors to his campaign. Millions, of course, die from diseases,
and one can only imagine if the billions spent on useless
elephantine bureaucracies like the Department of Homeland
Security had gone to hospitals and research. If the goal were
genuinely to protect lives, fighting terrorism would be a serious
matter for police and intelligence agencies, and a small project of a
nation's well-being.

   Compare, for a moment, Spain. After the Madrid bombings, the
police, in a few days, arrested those responsible. (After 9/11, the U.S.
rounded up more than 5,000 people- many of whom still in jail and not
a single one of whom has been proven to have any connection to any
form of terrorist activity.) They did not carpet-bomb Morocco. They
are quietly increasing police surveillance without Terror Alert national
panics and with little or no interruption of daily life. And,
geographically, demographically, and historically (the
fundamentalist dream of recuperating al-Andalus), there is a
much greater possibility of another terrorist attack in Spain
than in the U.S.

   But of course the current "war on terrorism" is not about saving
lives at all; it's about keeping power in the hands of a tiny cell of
ideologues. In the manner of all totalitarian societies, the Bush junta,
with a happily compliant mass media, has wildly exaggerated the
power of the Enemy. This has allowed them to wage a war in Iraq
they began planning long before 9/11 and to plot further invasions,
to suspend Constitutional rights and disdain international law, to
enrich their friends and ignore the opinions of most of the world.
Many Americans who dislike Bush will still vote for him in November
because the marketing campaign has made him appear the resolute
"wartime" Commander-in-Chief who will keep the nation "safe." It
has become futile to try to argue that this war on terror doesn't exist,
that the actual war in Iraq has nothing to do with the safety of
Americans at home, and that abroad it has killed or maimed
more Americans than 9/11. It remains to be seen what price
the country, and the world, will pay for this fantasy.


An unnamed "senior adviser" to Bush recently told the journalist Ron
Suskind that people like Suskind were members of "what we call the
reality-based community": those who "believe that solutions emerge
from [the] judicious study of discernible reality." However, he
explained, "That's not the way the world really works anymore.
We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
And while you're studying that reality... we'll act again, creating
other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how
things will sort out. We're history's actors, and you, all of you,
will be left to just study what we do."

This may well be the clearest expression yet of the Bush Doctrine. To
become enraged by particulars-- the daily slaughter in Iraq, the prison
torture, the worst economy since the Great Depression, the banana
republic tricks and slanders of the electoral campaign-- is to miss
the point. We are no longer in "discernible reality." In the second
term, the only choice will be to line up for your medication and enjoy
the New Freedom. As Bush now says in every speech, "freedom is
on the march."

Thanks for posting this. I still can't understand how he hasn't been pulled
out of his limo and beaten to death. Lucky for him he controls what the
media says about him.
The same thing happened with Ron Ray-gun. People were starving in the street
a block away from the White House--and his approval rating just kept rising?
I just don't understand how Americans think.
Take a ride in the country around WNY. Every house has who they are voting
for on their front lawn.
Bush signs outnumber Kerry signs--4 to 1?

bsp; Eliot Weinberger<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Among the things the second term of the Bush junta will bring is
the<BR>
&gt; New Freedom Initiative. This is a proposal, barely reported in the<BR>
&gt; press, to give all Americans- beginning with school children- a<BR>
&gt; standardized test for mental illness. Those who flunk the test will<BR>
&gt; be issued medication, and those who do not want to take their<BR>
&gt; medication will be urged to have it implanted under their skin.<BR>
&gt; Needless to say, the New Freedom commission, appointed by<BR>
&gt; the President, is composed almost entirely of executives, lawyers,<BR>
&gt; and lobbyists for pharmaceutical corporations.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; The question is: Will anyone pass the test? Half of
America is<BR>
&gt; clearly deranged, and it has driven the other half mad.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; The President openly declares that God speaks through
him.<BR>
&gt; The Republicans are making television advertisements featuring<BR>
&gt; the actor who played Jesus in Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the<BR>
&gt; Christ,&quot; while sending out pamphlets that warn that if Kerry
is<BR>
&gt; elected he will ban the Bible. Catholic bishops have decreed that<BR>
&gt; voting for Kerry is a sin (mortal or venial?) that must be
confessed<BR>
&gt; before one can take communion. The one piece of scientific<BR>
&gt; research actively promoted by the government is investigating<BR>
&gt; whether having others pray for you can cure cancer. (The National<BR>
&gt; Institute of Health has explained that this is &quot;imperative&quot;
because<BR>
&gt; poor people have limited access to normal health care.) At the<BR>
&gt; official gift shop in Grand Canyon National Park, they sell a book
that<BR>
&gt; states that this so-called natural wonder sprang fully formed in the
six<BR>
&gt; days of Creation. We already know that the current United States<BR>
&gt; government does not believe in global warming or the hazards of<BR>
&gt; pollution; now we know it doesn't believe in erosion either.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; The polls are evidence that the country is suffering a
collective<BR>
&gt; head injury. On any given issue-- the economy, the war in Iraq,<BR>
&gt; health care-- the majority perceive that the situation is bad and<BR>
&gt; the President has handled it badly. Yet these same people, in<BR>
&gt; these same polls, also say they'll be voting for Bush. Like a<BR>
&gt; battered wife-- realizing yet denying what is happening, still<BR>
&gt; making excuses for their man-- the voters are ruled by fear and<BR>
&gt; intimidation and the threat of worse to come. They've been<BR>
&gt; beaten up by the phantom of terrorism.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Every few weeks we're bludgeoned by warnings that
terrorists<BR>
&gt; may strike in a matter of days. Incited by the Department of<BR>
&gt; Homeland Security, millions have bought duct tape and plastic<BR>
&gt; sheeting to protect their homes from biological and chemical
attack,<BR>
&gt; and have amassed caches of canned food and bottled water. To<BR>
&gt; ensure that everyone everywhere stays afraid, 10,000 FBI agents<BR>
&gt; have been sent to small towns to talk to local police chiefs about
what<BR>
&gt; they can do to fight terrorism. After the massacre at Beslan,
school<BR>
&gt; principals received letters from the Department of Education
instructing<BR>
&gt; them to beware of strangers.The Vice President intones that if Kerry
is<BR>
&gt; elected, terrorists will be exploding nuclear bombs in the cities.
(And,<BR>
&gt; to anticipate all possibilities, also warns that terrorists may set
off<BR>
&gt; bombs before the election to influence the vote. . . but we're not<BR>
&gt; going to let them tell Americans who to vote for, are we?)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fear has infected even the most common transactions of
daily life.<BR>
&gt; It is not only visitors to the US who are treated as criminals,
with<BR>
&gt; fingerprints and photographs and retinal scans. Anyone entering any<BR>
&gt; anonymous office building must now go through security clearances<BR>
&gt; worthy of an audience with Donald Rumsfeld. At the airports, fear
of<BR>
&gt; flying has been replaced by fear of checking-in. Nearly every day
there<BR>
&gt; are stories of people arrested or detained for innocuous activities,
like<BR>
&gt; snapping a photo of a friend in the subway or wearing an antiwar<BR>
&gt; button&nbsp; while shopping in the mall. Worst of all, the whole
country<BR>
&gt; has acquiesced to the myth of terrorist omnipotence. Even those who<BR>
&gt; laugh at the color-coded Alerts and other excesses of the
anti-terror<BR>
&gt; apparatus do not question the need for the apparatus itself. The<BR>
&gt; Department of Homeland Security, after all, was a Democratic<BR>
&gt; proposal first rejected by Bush.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Common sense has retreated to the monasteries of a few websites. It
is<BR>
&gt; considered delusional to suggest that international terrorism is
nothing<BR>
&gt; more than a criminal activity performed by a handful of people,
that<BR>
&gt; Al-Qaeda and similar groups are the Weather Underground, the
Brigato<BR>
&gt; Rosso, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, with more sophisticated techniques<BR>
&gt; and more powerful weapons, operating in the age of hysterical
24-hour<BR>
&gt; television news. They are not an army. They are not waging a war.<BR>
&gt; They are tiny groups perpetrating isolated acts of violence.<BR>
&gt; <BR>

Yes, and in Sydney Australia soon too.
It seems ludicrous.
A beer and a fag after work is an Australian
tradition.

Not to mention what it will do to US independent
films!
Like that great little movie 'Smoke' & its sequel and
the recently released 'Coffee and Cigarettes' with the
meeting of two reformed smokers - Iggy Pop & Tom
Waits...and the beautiful segment with Taylor Mead.

of Fear

What color alert are you trying to scare the nation with now?

A people living under fear are 100% more likely to follow sheepishly,

as you steal our rights and ship our jobs overseas.

Who showed you this trick? Your C.I.A. trained Daddy?

What I fear most is You.

Ever vigilant and watchful is what we should be.

Always keeping a sharp eye on what you are up to.

Learning to ignore your slight of hand, and focusing on your objectives.

You have cost us 1,000 brave lives, for what cause?

What I fear most is You.

As people exercise their constitutional right to protest your =
convention.

You had the Police beat them like baby seals at harvest time.

Once again your blatant disregard for human rights is your driving =
force.

Chalk up another victory for control by panic politics.

You scare the shit out of me.

Because you control the media I know this will never happen.

................................................. But Ican =

------------------------------- This just into our news =

A Washington based Terrorist cell has been operating out of the White =
House and Capital Hill for the past four years. They have given away our =
jobs, stolen our Constitutional rights, Given Hugh tax breaks to the =
rich, Murdered our young soldiers, lied to us on a daily basis, lifted =
environmental controls,, and given themselves pay raises as our nation =
collapses under the weight of their corruption and greed.

What scares me the most is that its all true.

following Pam Browns' comments re Aussie....the beer and fag is a kind of
tradition (it fights with the cuppa which is also good - a cup of tea and a
sandwich won the Second World war for the British) here but coffee drinking
of quality coffees etc has escalated to alarming levels and smoking marijuna
are very popular these days...has been for years actually... (one (Green
Party) member of Parliament campaigned on freeing up the anti-marijuana
laws!) as is the consummation of P which is problematic etc...

its philosphic this smoke - like fog -and they'll smoke us out yet! but Ron
(Ron is undoubtedly Ron S of the Silliman fame, or maybe not?) has retired
into the shell of his Blogg and working for the Big Money Man and supporting
wars of terror, so its nearly impossible to smoke HIM out of his
obfuscations & interminable (if possibly brilliant) (if we could understand
them or get the time to read them all...) analyses of poets  and whether the
letter "i" is superior to the letter "e" and  (just joshing ) ..... which is
sad as he was once one of the greats surely with Tjanting etc (lol) ...I was
ambiguous on the subject and gave myself the excuse of Montaigne's essay: i
waxed on about drunkenness and other juvenilia but the very next essay by
Montaigne is, about, Drunkenesss!!

i have never smoked, when I was about 9 or so, the health people came to our
school and said that a study indicated smoking probably caused cancer -
hence i never smoked - (and that was in about 1957) my father died of lung
cancer probably from smoking and my mother's stroke from which she died was
in all probabililty exacerbated if not caused by smoke -so they died of
smoke but they enjoyed their life mostly. "Smoke" was a great movie - the
bloke who takes a photograph of a street scene from the same angle each day
for years and the other guy talking about Walter Raleigh (Rawley) who found
tobacco in the Americas (where are they?) and returned to England with that
very valuable product and giving a short "lecture" in the Brooklyn corner
shop (store) to the (surprisingly?) quite interested  locals...a good film
in its way

I think breathing at readings should be banned, it's very obvious that the danger to anyone from another person's exhalations is
immense, think of the germs, let alone the contagious notions, AND OF COURSE, anything involving automotive transport of the generic
kind, be it your own car, a lift, a taxi, is so heinous, think of the carbon monoxide, carpeople are murderers per se, AND I also
think it's high time we transformed the whole of our society into a collection of self-loving prissy bores who even have the nerve
to pretend to be avant-garde. I like nothing better than a paralytically boring poetry reading where anyone who is there is
frightened to act like a human being, yaheeh, communal dishonesty is just the way to make things better.

I am a smoker, btw, and HATE the habit, but I don't like being told what to do.

Grin and scowl.

By state law there is no smoking in the workplace in Massachusetts. The logic is
simple. The long-term costs to society are clear. Business didn't fall of. It
picked up. It turns out that more people stay away from bars because of smoke
than avoid them if they can't.

Smoking is lung rape.

Period.

Whether you're raping your own or someone else's.

I had to spend most of the time outside in the cold when Gary read at La Tazza.

It was awful.  No one should have to make the choice,  breathe and
freeze or be warm and wheeze.

To me, any attempt to ROMaNTICIzE smoking as something bohemians
always do or to claim one's right to smoke as an essential freedom is
entirely WroNgHEaded.

Because pain and suffering are subjective, those of you who have
never struggled to breathe, who have never felt your lungs turn into
tight little gaspers while someone unthinkingly smoked in your
vulnerable presence, can never really understand.

I mean, I can't even be around cigarette smoke when I'm OUTSIDE --
when, for example, the person walking several yards in front of me on
the sidewalk is smoking!  I can't go into Grassroots -- a  nonsmoking
bar since the statute! -- because there is enough smoke residue
ground into its walls and enough smoke filtering in from the gang of
smokers outside to make me ill.

I'll say it again.

Smoking is lung rape.

It's not ideological.

Period.

Dear Ron,
you're a pretty smart guy, and have much to teach us about
many things, especially many things to do with poetry.
That's why it pains me to tell you you don't know everything.

With some smokers, myself included, smoking is NOT an
addiction, and IS very much about pleasure, and communion.

I do not smoke everyday, nor do I smoke in my home.
When I do smoke it's American Spirit cigarettes, which are
chemical free, and taste delicious!  My friends and I love them.
And we very much enjoy smoking, together, lighting up, together,
drinking and smoking, together.

There's something wonderful about
holding a match to a friend's face for them to light up, I love it, and
love being lit up myself, by others.  Something about shared fire
awakens quiet molecules.

But I have more than once wept tears of heavy sadness for all
the little ashtrays of New York City, which are, somewhere, up
there, in the dark, no glowing embers lighting the way to their
glass and fiberglass bases.

On the other hand Ron, I do believe your harsh words were meant
to be harsh because you care.  And I'm not making a joke here,
I do believe you care.  You wouldn't have taken the time out of
your day to write what you did if you didn't care.

Thanks for caring Ron,
and I'm glad you don't smoke because you don't want to,
but I will continue smoking because I do want to, and for
all the reasons I know I do,
CAConrad

Hi Ron,
You'll be pleased to hear that the UK city of
Liverpool is going entirely No Smoking - I just read
this today in The Guardian Weekly.  They don't say how
they'll do it...smoke detectors, anti-smoking fines
officers (like parking cops) etc etc etc...

dear Nada,
just because people like to smoke doesn't mean
that they are romanticizing smoking.

It always seems like a cheap shot to me to use
the word romanticize, especially with vice.

Nicotine is a plunge some of us enjoy taking.
As is alcohol, martinis, beer, whatever, some of
us like to drink and smoke with friends.

Getting a little buzz with people you care about
is a wonderful thing, some of us believe.  And no,
we're not living in a fantasy, romanticizing.  We
are quite often people who are very fucking much
IN this world day to day and want to relax.

Lung rape though?  C'mon.  Ask the geese
flying over New York City choking on the truck
fumes because you all decided you wanted
some chocolate ice cream delivered, or
whatever it is you want.  To act like you are
only complicit in polluting the air if you smoke
is kind of a stretch.

The Native Americans didn't give us jet fuel
to fuck the atmosphere up with, but they did
share their tobacco, and I'll smoke it to the
grave thank you, whether it's next year or
next decade.

craig,
would seem to me that when you talk about the warm fuzzy feeling you get
when you help a friend light up that that *is* romantizing.
let me share my own experience with the effects of second hand smoke.
i watched my mother die of  breast cancer that mastizied. she had a
strong constitution so lasted longer than the average. 3 years.
lets talk about the charms of cancer treatments. its a way to poison the
cancer cells. hmnn. whats wrong with this picture?
go ahead, watch someone you love fade away. watch them sicken and fade
into the last comma. listen late at night as they struggle to draw
breath. pray that their passage is painless. listen to them pray for
their own death. imagine angels at 4am so you can stop crying and keep
the last vestiges of your sanity and a smile on your face if they wake
before going.
lets not even talk about the intimacies involved in those last days and
months. let the words ' adult diaper' and the image of someone who can't
keep their liquid diet down suffice. you have to hold their heads so
they don't choke.
speaking as one with  native american background, we didn't give you
shit. and in return i would ask that you put down your shovel and
refrain from shoveling yours ( and the tobbaco companies) my way.
*snort*

See here:

As can be expected, the blocking is "cackhanded". You can still see it

Of course, this blocks ex-pat US citizens as well. Maybe he just doesn't

Pam

you, and maybe Ron, might like to know that another UK city is also intending to follow Liverpool's lead, that one is Leicester,
which happens to be where I live. As with Liverpool the detail is fuzzy, I believe they plan on banning smoking in all city centre
pubs and restaurants, for a start. The irony is that the levels of traffic pollution in central Leicester are the second worst in
the UK, after central London. (The city lies in the shallow of a river valley hence the micro-climate is particularly good at
retaining photo-chemical smogs formed from traffic emissions). Now I don't want to Romanticise smoking (romanticise: to give
something the attributes of an element of a fanciful story, a fable, a +roman+) BUT if the logic of the anti-smoking lobby is
followed through then the bans should also include carbon monoxide emissions etc so cars should be banned on the same logic.

This isn't to prettify smoking, although as Craig says, it is a communal act +among smokers+ it is also an addiction. A fair
proportion of poetry readings I go to are in no smoking premises as it is, I don't have a problem with that, but when someone says
there should be a blanket prohibition I get very twitchy. Particularly if you are talking about readings in pubs. I was a non-smoker
for a few years and had no problem about other people smoking. I'm aware about the arguments on passive smoking but, well, oxygen is
the guarantee of our mortality, we burn, and chemically pure water will kill you. It just needs some common-sense.

Hi Ron,
You'll be pleased to hear that the UK city of
Liverpool is going entirely No Smoking - I just read
this today in The Guardian Weekly.  They don't say how
they'll do it...smoke detectors, anti-smoking fines
officers (like parking cops) etc etc etc...

Of course we could bring the list back into focus by listing poets who've
died because of smoking. I'll throw out two names for a start:

1. Paul Blackburn--throat cancer
2. Richard Elman--lung cancer


A couple of comments: I was a very heavy smoker. I quit 35 years ago. For
the first several years after I quit I didn't mind other people's smoke.
Then I began to, and began to notice that the next day my throat would
still be raspy. Nobody gets to smoke inside my house, not even a little,
because the smell stays in the furniture and rugs for days. Tho it does
remind me of my grandfather (emphysema), my uncle (emphysema), my aunt
(heart disease) and my father (lung cancer).

It's difficult for me to give readings in venues where smoking is allowed.
Fortunately there are very few left in this country. Arguing that some kind
of right is being denied when smoking is banned is like arguing that
smoking should be permitted at the opera. It would certainly change the
vocal quality.

A very very few people manage to smoke and not become addicted. Heroin is
far less addictive--you really have to work at it to get hooked.

It would be lovely to rid the world of all air pollutants--best is
preferrable to better. To ban what can't be banned isn't hypocricy, it's a
matter of what's immediately practical. And it allows us to live to work on
the rest.

Extortion 101: College Republicans Intimidate Senior Citizens

The College Republican National Committee has raised $6.3 million this=20=

year through an aggressive and misleading fund-raising campaign that=20
collected money from senior citizens who thought they were giving to=20
the election efforts of President Bush and other top Republicans.

Many of the top donors were in their 80s and 90s. The donors wrote=20
checks =97 sometimes hundreds and, in at least one case, totaling more=20=

than $100,000 =97 to groups with official sounding-names such as=20
"Republican Headquarters 2004," "Republican Elections Committee" and=20
the "National Republican Campaign Fund."

But all of those groups, according to the small print on the letters,=20
were simply projects of the College Republicans, who collected all of=20
the checks.

And little of the money went to election efforts.

Of the money spent by the group this year, nearly 90 percent went to=20
direct-mail vendors and postage expenses, according to records filed=20
with the Internal Revenue Service.

Some of the elderly donors, meanwhile, wound up bouncing checks and=20
emptying their bank accounts.

"I don't have any more money," said Cecilia Barbier, a 90-year-old=20
retired church council worker in New York City. "I'm stopping giving to=20=

everybody. That was all my savings that they got."

Barbier said she "wised up." But not before she made more than 300=20
donations totaling nearly $100,000 this year, the group's fund-raising=20=

records show.

Now, she said, "I'm really scrounging."

In Van Buren, Ark., Monda Jo Millsap, 68, said she emptied her savings=20=

account by writing checks to College Republicans, then got a bank loan=20=

of $5,000 and sent that, too, before totaling her donations at more=20
than $59,000.

College Republicans serve as the party's outreach organization on=20
college campuses. The group has been a starting place for many=20
prominent conservatives, including Bush adviser Karl Rove, anti-tax=20
activist Grover Norquist and former Christian Coalition executive=20
director Ralph Reed.

Once a part of the Republican National Committee, the group is now=20
independent. It is set to help get out the vote for Tuesday's election.

Officers of the College Republican National Committee did not respond=20
to questions about their fund raising.

"I think the College Republican National Committee is an amazing=20
organization which is getting a lot of young people involved in the=20
political process," said Paul Gourley, the group's treasurer, who=20
signed many of the fund-raising letters.

He referred questions to the group's communications director, Alison=20
Aikele, who declined to comment.

An attorney and adviser to the group defended the fund raising.

"We have tens of thousands of donors, and I wouldn't extrapolate a=20
message about an entire organization by sampling less than a tenth of a=20=

percent of the donors," said Craig Engle, a Washington, D.C., attorney=20=

and outside adviser to the College Republicans.

"There are tens of thousands of very, very satisfied and happy donors=20
that enjoy a relationship with the College Republicans and their=20
fund-raising process."

Internal dissent
But since at least 2001, some leaders of College Republicans have=20
objected to the tone and targeting of the fund raising done by Response=20=

Dynamics, the Virginia company that handles the direct-mail campaign.

Response Dynamics officials could not be reached for comment.

"We felt their fund-raising practices were deceptive, to say the=20
least," said George Gunning, former treasurer of the College=20
Republicans.

Gunning said he and two other board members fought to cut ties with=20
Response Dynamics but were blocked by other leaders led by Scott=20
Stewart, the chairman of the College Republicans from 1999 to 2003. As=20=

chairman, Stewart was the paid, full-time manager of the organization.=20=

Gunning said he was assured that fund-raising tactics would change.

The board debated the fund-raising practices after the family of an=20
elderly Indiana woman with Alzheimer's disease demanded that her=20
donations be returned. The woman's family said it had sent a registered=20=

letter asking that she be taken off the mailing list, but the=20
solicitations continued.

Only after a newspaper reported on the story did the College=20
Republicans refund $40,000 to the family, according to Jackie Boyle,=20
one of the woman's nieces.

"I think this is a nationwide scam," Boyle said on hearing of recent=20
complaints. "They're covering the whole country ... they need to be=20
investigated."

Stewart is the director of Bush's Nevada campaign operation, and=20
campaign officials said he would not be available to comment for this=20
story.

The Washington State Attorney General's Office received at least six=20
complaints about the College Republicans fund-raising letters from 2000=20=

to 2002, but has no record of any complaints since then. The complaints=20=

cited "fund raising representations" and "senior exploitation." The=20
Attorney General's Office wrote letters to the College Republicans, but=20=

a spokeswoman could not determine the outcome of the complaints=20
yesterday.

In response to the Indiana family's complaints, College Republicans=20
worked to be able to keep more of the money raised by Response=20
Dynamics, got more oversight of the content of the letters and had been=20=

working to improve "the message of our solicitations and to change the=20=

contract further so that our letters target a wider age spectrum,"=20
according to a summary of a 2001 College Republicans board retreat.

The group considered ending its affiliation with Response Dynamics and=20=

was preparing a financial plan "so that we might terminate the contract=20=

in the future," the summary said.

But the young Republicans and the veteran fund-raisers stayed together.

This year, as millions of dollars flowed in, College Republicans=20
falsely claimed in letters that checks were only trickling in and that=20=

the group was in a constant budget crisis.

And the elderly continued to be a major source of donations.

There are far more retired people giving to College Republicans than to=20=

The Times was able to determine the ages of 49 of the top 50 individual=20=

donors to the College Republicans. The median age of the donors is 85,=20=

and 14 of them are 90 or older.

"That can't be true"
Donors interviewed this week frequently expressed disbelief when they=20
were told how much they gave to the College Republicans.

"That can't be true," said Francis Lehar, a 91-year-old retired music=20
publisher, when he was told records showed he gave the College=20

to the group, records show.

"It surprises me that it goes to them and not to the other names that=20
they had," he said. "I admire their skill in writing letters."

The letters are computer-generated, personalized form letters, but the=20=

recipients often view them as personal correspondence.

"All the kids that were the head of this organization, they would keep=20=

saying, 'You've got to keep on or we won't be able to keep up with=20

the group's most generous donors.

She spoke on the condition she not be identified.

She grew concerned when repeated letters came earlier this year asking=20=

for donations for a "Republican Headquarters 2004 Membership Card."

The card was merely a block of text inside a dotted line on the back of=20=

the letter. The holder was supposed to cut it out and carry it with=20
her.

But the letter was infused with urgency.

"If I do not have your completed RH membership renewal form within the=20=

next ten days, your membership will be put on suspension," one letter=20
said.

"President Bush cannot afford your membership and involvement in the=20
Republican Party to be wavering at this crucial time."

The group wanted a donation of $25 to $500 for the card. If the donor=20
declined, he or she was urged to send at least $5 "to cover the cost of=20=

having the card printed for you."

"You had to pay something for the membership card," the retired=20
bookkeeper said. "I sent in four different checks to him and every time=20=

he said he didn't receive them."

The four checks totaled $1,105.

"He kept saying he was going to cancel me. He was constantly asking for=20=

money."

For her and other donors, the mail was part nuisance, part companion.=20
Several spoke of sorting the mail and writing checks almost as their=20
job this campaign year. And many thought their work alone would make=20
the difference in a Bush victory.

"And they kept telling me I've got to do this or we can't win," the=20
retired bookkeeper said. "You see, I was the only one. They said the=20
others had quit. I was the only one they were writing to, I thought."

Where the money goes
The College Republicans had another warning in September 2003, when the=20=

Center for Public Integrity, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group,=20
issued a report on the explosive fund-raising growth by the College=20
Republicans. The report noted that several elderly donors who were=20
contacted did not appear to know to whom they had given money.

Response Dynamics, its affiliates and other companies related to the=20
fund raising get most of the money raised by the College Republicans.

About $9 million of the College Republicans' reported spending this=20
year appeared to go into fund-raising expenses, according to a Times=20
analysis of reports filed with the IRS.

About $313,000, roughly 3 percent, went for travel, convention expenses=20=

and "hospitality." About $210,000 went to payroll expenses, helping pay=20=

for campus organizers who have been drumming up support for the GOP=20
ticket among young people.

The large amount of money devoted to fund raising, and the small amount=20=

for political activities, is unusual among the top ranks of the=20
burgeoning field of so-called 527 independent political groups.

Of the $20 million the anti-Bush group MoveOn.org spent, according to=20
its filings, 93 percent went to media, advertising, marketing and=20
polling.

Of the $13.7 million spent by the anti-John Kerry group Swift Boat=20
Veterans for Truth, 90 percent went to media, advertising and media=20
consulting.

Who signs the letters
Most of the College Republicans' fund-raising appeals come signed by=20
two young Republicans who, in the letters, are billed as directors and=20=

officers of the projects needing money.

"National officers for the College Republicans have to wear a lot of=20
hats," said Gourley, one of the signers, who is a junior at the=20
University of South Dakota.

He would not answer specific questions about the fund raising.

He said he knows his name appears on letters sent from Washington, D.C.=20=

Asked if he approves each letter, he said, "We have certain processes=20
set up."

Matthew Kennicott, listed in spending reports as the College=20
Republicans' political director, also signs letters. He could not be=20
reached.

Ryan Call, former co-chairman of the College Republicans, said that=20
when he was there, the group didn't have a lot of involvement in=20
crafting messages for fund-raising letters.

"When you contract stuff out, you cede a lot of control away to the=20
people you are working with," said Call, 28, a law student at the=20
University of Denver.

Officials of Response Dynamics have publicly described their strategy.

"Direct mail fund raising means asking for money and asking for it=20
often," company President Ron Kanfer wrote in a 1991 article on the art=20=

of the pitch.

"You must literally force them to send money."

Breathless tone
An August fund-raising letter showed that aggressive approach, telling=20=

donors there was a Democratic conspiracy to intercept the committee's=20
mail:

"Given what I've learned, you and I must take every precaution=20
necessary.

"Apparently the Democrats don't have any concern about hurting you,=20
your family or America.

"Their sole concern is revenge =97 vengeance =97 retribution."

With the approach of Tuesday's election, the letters have become even=20
more breathless.

Last Saturday, a donor received what appears to be a photocopied=20
handwritten note from the director of one committee: "Please understand=20=

I have no one else to turn to. This is serious: We will have to close=20
our doors!

"I need your help now!"

Group growing
While the vast majority of the money raised goes to pay fund-raising=20
expenses, the College Republicans have used some money to expand=20
operations.

The group says it has tripled in size in recent years, with 120,000=20
members on 1,148 campuses.

Rove, Bush's top political strategist, spoke to College Republican=20
leaders during the GOP Convention, and said the group's organizing was=20=

"absolutely vital to the election."

The group goes door-to-door at college dorms and fraternity and=20
sorority houses to register voters and recruit volunteers.

The College Republicans this year got $220,000 from another GOP group,=20=

the Republican State Leadership Committee.

They also received large donations from two more-traditional political=20=

donors, businessmen John Templeton, who gave $400,000, and Carl=20
Lindner, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, who gave $375,000.

The College Republicans themselves are rarely mentioned in the group's=20=

fund-raising letters. There is the occasional letter on College=20
Republican National Committee letterhead that talks about the=20
organizing work on college campuses.

The focus is on the presidential campaign, congressional races and the=20=

constant threat of what they portray as likely liberal victories in=20
November.

The letters imply close connections to Bush, Vice President Dick=20
Cheney, Republican leaders and the party organization. The pitches=20
sometimes promise that special messages will be hand-delivered to Bush=20=

or others if they are sent back with a donation.

Most donors interviewed said they get up to 50 solicitations in the=20
mail each day. That pile can include four or more from the College=20
Republicans.

"My house looks like a post office, and I'm not exaggerating," said=20
Anne Kravic, a retired school-district employee in Parma, Ohio.

Kravic rubber-bands each day's mail and marks the top of the pile with=20=

the date. As the bundles take over the house, she has stopped inviting=20=

people over.

"I wouldn't say that a single week passed I didn't send something and=20
sometimes twice a week, depending on how serious the situation was=20
according to them," she said.

Her small monthly pension cannot keep up with the life of a political=20
financier.

"I'm tired of it. I'm quitting. It is too much for me. My bank account=20=

has been overdrawn already," she said.

Elliot Baines is an 84-year-old Florida retiree who says he has a hard=20=

time just carrying the mail he gets each day now.

"It's almost too much for me to handle," he said.

Baines was surprised to hear he had given more than $63,000 and that it=20=

had all gone to College Republicans. He said he was swayed to give,=20
sometimes against his better instincts, by the power of the letters.

"I thought if I paid them off once it would send them away, but it just=20=

encourages them to send more," he said. "It is just a rat race in this=20=

house to pay off these people and hope that they quit.

"But they don't. They keep sending."=20=

mIEKAL here from the birthplace of DADA:

We visited the birthplace of Tristin Tzara, & leave it so say we had a dada
experience, unbelieveable, don't have time to write in detail at this moment
but we documented the various Tzara monuments & sculptures & made contact with
the leading Tzara authority in Romania who happens to live in Moinesti.  Leave
it say that the guy was the archetype of an self-absorbed but intensely
impassioned intellectual who made his living teaching french in the local high
school. (In 3 hours he showed me his CV 3 times!) He has passed on a 2 volume
anthology of essays about Tzara which is in about 4-5 language, a cd of Tzara
musical realization (he gave me an extra copy of the CD which he said to pass
on to a library, John B & Michael B will have to argue over who receives it!).
They also did a massive 100th anniversay of Tzara's birth "mail art" show which
Zon photo documented & we have permission to release the whole of it as a PDF
book.  He is also taking submission for vispo, text or essays related to Tzara
for the third volume of the anthology, I'll post mailing & email info later
when I have it in front of me.  (Internet connections are sketchy at best).

When we went to the high school to meet him he had had a couple of his students
translate & read a prepared statement.  He was somewhat official about making
sure we had the complete Tzara experience.  He also suggested (tho since he
spoke frenchified Romanian, it was a little hard for Camille to understand
everything) that the visual poetry avant garde is alive & well in bulgaria,
romania, hungary etc & that he would help up produce an anthology.   A lot of
the kids in the high school spoke completely accessible English, they all
wanted to move away from Moinesti as soon as they graduated & many of them
wanted to make it clear that altho their teacher (high school teachers are
called professors here, high school is called college) immersed them in Tzara
ephemera they could not relate to the DADA style of art, which made no sense to
them.  He had also had his students produce Tzara's play, (sorry, don't know
the french) The Gas Heart, which even tho they acted & produced it they didn't
understand it one bit.  Regardless, they informed me that they were very proud
of what Tzara represented for their city.

There was no actual representational sculpture of Tzara, which I could swear I
read about in my searches on the net, so I was not able to shake hands with his
physical likeness, but I did walk backwards thru the giant sculpture spelling
out the letters "DADA".  The letters being maybe 25 meters high.  Stay tuned
for the final product, a digital interactive video piece called TZARA IN
PURGATORY.

Other than the fact that their are far too many MacDonald's & the worst early
90s American techno playing everywhere, it is such a relief to step outside of
Bush's nightmare for a month.

Best from the other side of the world

We are a little bit out of the way (about 40 miles from Charlottesville; =
over Afton Mt. at the junction of I64 and I81) for most of you, but =
people in the area might be interested.

Arther Sze will read and discuss his poetry at Mary Baldwin College on =
Tuesday, November 2 from 6:00 to 7:30 p.m. in Francis Auditorium--it's =
attached to our Science Building, which will seem appropriate for those =
of you who know his poetry.  Be sure to vote before you come. =20

To inaugurate The Exchange Rate Reading Series, a reading series
dedicated solely to fostering artistic activity between Canada and the
US (or just Buffalo),

A N D  of course T O  E A T & D R I N K!

>>>Please feel free to extend this invitation to anyone at all you
think would be interested--I'm hoping this can be an event that will
attract people inside & outside English Departments and the academic
community.<<<

Derek Beaulieu is an editor, writer and arts worker. He is the past
publisher of Housepress and is the author of with wax (Coach House
2003). He is currently co-editing an issue of Open Letter and an

Gregory Betts has edited two books of early avant-garde Canadian
poetry (Exile Editions, 2003), with a third forthcoming on the
experimental writing of Lawren Harris (Exile Editions, 2004). He has
been the Assistant Director of the North American Centre for
Interdisciplinary Poetics (www.poetics.yorku.ca) since 2001, and is
completing his dissertation on the Canadian avant-garde. His first
book of poetry, If Language, collects the myths of humans struggling
to speak against the flow of linear language and, through the form of
the anagram, attempts the same. It was short-listed for Spineless
Books' Fitzpatrick O'Dinn Prize for Constraint-Based Literature (Rhode
Island). It will be published by Book Thug this fall.

Rob McLennan is the author of ten trade poetry collections, most
recently what's left (Talonbooks), and stone, book one (Palimpsest

above/ground press & STANZAS magazine (for long poems/sequences) since
they both began in 1993, his own poetry, fiction & reviews have
appeared in print in eight countries, three of which he has done
reading tours in. In 1999 he won the Canadian Authors' Association /

Wake up. There's no such thing as "chemical free." That's a marketing
term, not a description of what actual objects, particularly ones made
of organic materials such as cigarettes or you or me, are.
Everything's chemicals!  Confusing marketing with reality can be
deadly. (Particularly with a company that appropriates "pc" native
American identity to market their cigarettes. Which is as ethically
corrupt as -- or more than? -- the Marlboro Man in its way, seems to
me.) Also, if you're sitting in the blue air next to someone smoking a
commercial brand, then all the supposed advantage of your health-food
cigs is completely meaningless, you know.

“A stunning performance! . . . Aldon Nielsen’s work reminds one of how
adventuresome and delightful an experience reading can be. His criticism
offers fresh perspectives informed by a wide range of contextual data.
Presented with wit and clarity, Dr. Nielsen's commentary sends readers
back to the literary works he analyzes with renewed enthusiasm and
broadened horizons.”—Lorenzo Thomas, author of Extraordinary Measures:
Afrocentric Modernism and 20th-Century American Poetry

Aldon Nielsen’s book Black Chant: Languages of African American
Postmodernism was a ground-breaking work of scholarship that examined
modern and postmodern developments in the work of African American poets
since the Second World War and their contributions to both African
American culture and American modernism.


Integral Music extends the terms of the studies begun in Black Chant
through a more in-depth look at the work of key writers and poets in the
decades following the Second World War. While Nielsen examines anew such
key figures as Amiri Baraka, he also provides the first extended studies
of significant but often overlooked figures in African American poetry,
such as Russell Atkins and Stephen Jonas. His essay on Bob Kaufman
points toward the critical intersection of poetry and jazz in African
American letters, as does his essay on performance poet Jayne Cortez.


Nielsen's studies in this volume affirm the importance and centrality of
African American poets to American intellectual life and international,
modernist, and postmodernist poetry today.


Aldon Lynn Nielsen is Kelly Professor of American Literature at
Pennsylvania State University and author of several books, including
Reading Race.

not to go about this tiresome subject (children, yes, smoking is bad for
you), but it is more than simply about becoming a corporate drone.
Please see Bright Leaves if you need some learning.  Other types of
non-risk aversive behavior include:  mountain climbing, timber cutting,
crabbing, replacing all dairy with soy, etc.  The stigma upon smoking has
something more than little puritanical and more than a little
hypocritical.  I'd take nationalized health care without rigid smoking
laws (by and large, the way the rest of the "industrialized" world, where,
dear friends they have better life expectancies (28 other countries!))
than the US.

What befuddles me is the desire to eliminate everywhere, in places where
children don't go, in bars where all the adults are consenting, where more
than likely, etc.  Or where due provision can be made for air quality
(THAT ain't rocket science).  Are we all adults here or not?

If I may, a momentary counter-stress poem for kari and all of us -
before getting back to election labors & stressin':

                    *

Detach the fallen, white-bloomed Dahlia

On its green-leafed, broken stem

 Softly touched down on the wet sidewalk:

 Carry it on up the highest hill =AD its neck

 Slightly folded as if a dormant child:

 Hold it up to the public man:

 The woman =AD cell-phone cradled to the ear -

 Swifting around the corner in a pickup truck

 The men on the scaffold who tack-up the cedar shingles:

 Go against all that might not, whatever is forbidden

 Whatever kills or dazes or dims

 Go, Dahlia, your petals slightly dirtied by soil

 Go, Dahlia, the ghostly spider escaping, spindling down

 From inside your multiple, tender white lips:

Go =AD step by step =AD breeze in the face =AD blooming.

Thanks for this David. I saw ginsberg perform this
piece in San Marcos, TX, the year before he died,
and couldn't help remembering his wonderful
rhythms as I read over it. Don't smoke!

Also, a shout-out to all you Sox fans out there.
What a wonderful 10 days. Jim, if you're

My apologies...I don't contribute to the list very often, but have been a

Anyway. Couldn't resist chiming in on this one. "Pain and suffering" are
indeed "subjective," Pamela, and it is for this reason that I take issue
with your characterization of it as "rape". I realize this is a poetics
list, but still I have to wonder: what poetic sensibility of yours was it
that led you to equate cigarette smoking with a violent sexual act?

Jack Gilbert.
 I remember being at a party with him, in San Francisco, in the late 60s.
Someone's birthday.
Jack showed me a picture of a forest, just trees, and I said, "That's the
Black Forest." Indeed it was. Ancestral memories at the cellular level?
I've got to get out more often!

It was not my "poetic sensibility" but rather my faculty of <I>logic</I>.

Firstly, the word "rape", though it primarily connotes a violent
sexual act, also means "a violation."

As we refer, for example, to the rape of the earth.

Secondly, like sexual rape, rape of the lungs involves the violation
of a physical boundary, penetration by a foreign, harmful substance
-- always with some degree of trauma and sometimes resulting in
death.

[Whoever it was on this list that suggested better air filtering
technology obviously does not get it.  The most brilliantly
engineered ventilated ashtray in the world  can not filter out the
noxiousness of cigarette smoke for those who are sensitive to it.
That's why some of us feel it should not be allowed in ANY PUBLIC
SPACE at all.]

Thirdly, only an extremely emotionally charged word like "rape" can
express my strong feelings on this issue.

Fourthly, my name is not Pamela... but wasn't Pamela, the one in the
novel, a raped person?

Fifthly, it is not as if I never smoked.  I spent a couple of years
addicted to GARAMs -- Indonesian clove cigarettes (turns out they're
even more lethal than the US corporate kind).  I understand their
allure and their insidious physiological effects firsthand.  I'm not
a  PURITAN and my objection to people smoking is not , as I said,
IDEOLOGICAL.  Smoke HURTS me and makes me wretched with discomfort.
It denies me my most basic need for breath.  Why does that idea make
people either flippant or defiant?

Sixthly, I nursed my grandfather when he was dying from emphysema.
Although he was hooked up to an ambulatory oxygen machine, and we
sometimes found him in the bathroom, hacking away and coughing up
hideous globs -- and SMOKING.

Hey yeah---
      I just have this very strong feeling that if someone would've
      told Allen that in the mid-50s when he was poor and pre-famous,
      he would have said something like "well, easy for you to say."

it's happened that i've pushed this work into obscene discomfort, what
were they in abu gharayb, what were they in the beheadings, the darfur
killings, the rapes, the slaughter, what's the sex in it, what's sexy
about it, what's the desire, what's the impetus. i have nightmares, don't
we all, see these things in them, there's something in control, in broken
things, something pushing us to our limits, and their bodies past their
limits towards death. in spite of the stereotypes, these horrors emerged,
calling us in, making us complicit, highway accident gawkers, kick the
corpse, take the teeth, the ear, the prick. in war everything from bullet
to cock impales, and these are my war, sloughing them out to you with all
the power seduction can offer when the result is murder and murder alone.
then to remember these aren't bodies but polygons, nodes, but structures
that like skin bear witness to years of violence. this is what people do
to each other, look how pretty it is.

please forwards!!

www.globalvote2004.org where non-Americans can log in and cast their
vote for US president.

Even if you are not a US citizen, the November 2 presidential election
will have a huge impact on your life. The very idea of democracy
requires that you should have a say in choosing who determines your
destiny. This site therefore allows non-Americans to vote in the 2004
US presidential election.

GLOBALVOTE2004.ORG is totally neutral. You may vote for any candidate.
Your vote will be kept secret. And you may only vote once.We will count
the votes 48 hours before the election and submit the result to the US
media. Just letting US citizens know how the world has voted could
influence what looks like a tight race.

The refrain "What happens in America affects us all", is a common one
coming from all four corners of the globe these days, especially with
the US elections just days away.

what happens inside, when the body turns its fury against itself, when
it's all over, when this scenario has the uncomfortable ring of truth.
more difficult this, watching for light among the shattered organs,
imaginary, chora, all that cultural debris hanging by shreds to flesh torn
from its moorings. if these are uncomfortable to watch, they are
uncomfortable to make, each loophole closing before i can proceed, if it
is 'i' and not 'one' if it is all day all night if it won't stop if it
can't stop

i don't know if the gender is right or the right order but i have been in
there but not in there, this fantasm, this uncanny
this political assault this slaughter
this ragged hinge

Yes, we say "rape of the Earth" and the Earth is often
seen as female, so we really are going back to the gender
specific use and misuse of power.

It's a loaded word, "rape," and no matter how it's sliced
and cross sectioned here, it's still being used to manipulate
the conversation.  It's being used to put those who smoke in
a position of coming AFTER you, you poor, helpless victim.

Give me a break.  No one is tying anyone down in a bar
and blowing smoke in the face.  Although sometimes a bar
can be fun with a bunch of folks tied into the bar stools.
One would hope it's consensual, but since there are gags
in the mouth, well, there's really no way of knowing for sure,
so let the fun begin, and sort it all out later.

Oh, and as far as the American Spirit cigarettes I smoke
that a few have written on this List and directly to me about,
regardless of what you think, I like those cigarettes the most
because they are MORE potent.  They are made with organic
and unprocessed tobacco, and don't make the skin itch later.
So it's really because they're stronger that I like them, not
because I believe that they are "health food" cigarettes, just
to clear the matter up.  When folks who smoke Kools or
Camels, or whatever, try the Spirits, they tend to get wide eyed
on the first puff, and choke.  But it's a nice, husky flavor that
goes quite nicely with gin.

It's been great debating vice with poets, no matter how many
places the conversation goes.  I mean, theory is interesting,
but sometimes talking about what turns people on or off is
a nice and different angle on poetics.  What if, in addition to
the regular bio on poetry books, where we find out where the
poet went to school, they also list their favorite stimulants,
or if they prefer meditation?  I'd rather see that than a photo.

Maybe it would actually mean nothing about the poems in
the book, maybe it just means I'm nosey.  Okay then.

peace of lung,
CAConrad

Vice President Cheney calls Iraq, =B3a remarkable success story.=B2 This is wha=
t
our State Department is saying this morning about traveling to Iraq.
Travel Warning
United States Department of State
Bureau of Consular Affairs
Washington, DC 20520
=20

This information is current as of today, document.write(Date()+".") Fri Oct
29 08:06:42 2004. continue to be targeted by insurgent groups for kidnappin=
g
and murder. Military operations continue. There are daily attacks against
Multinational Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) throughout the country.

There is credible information that terrorists are targeting civil aviation.
Civilian and military aircraft arriving in and departing from Baghdad
International Airport have been subjected to small arms and missiles.
Civilian aircraft do not generally possess systems, such as those found on
military aircraft, capable of defeating man-portable, surface-to-air
missiles (MANPADS). Anyone choosing to utilize civilian aircraft to enter o=
r
depart Iraq should be aware of this potential threat, as well as the
extremely high risk to road transportation described below. Official U.S.
Government (USG) personnel are strongly encouraged to use U.S. military or
other USG aircraft when entering and departing Iraq due to concerns about
security of civilian aircraft servicing Iraq. Currently, USG personnel are
only authorized to travel commercially on Royal Jordanian Airlines.

All vehicular travel in Iraq is extremely dangerous. There have been
numerous attacks on civilian vehicles, as well as military convoys. Attacks
occur throughout the day, but travel at night is exceptionally dangerous.
Travel in or through Ramadi and Fallujah, travel between al-Hillah and
Baghdad, and travel between the International Zone and Baghdad Internationa=
l
Airport is particularly dangerous. Occasionally, U.S. Government personnel
are prohibited from traveling to select areas depending on prevailing
security conditions. There continues to be heavy use of Improvised Explosiv=
e
Devices (IEDs) and/or mines on roads, particularly in plastic bags, soda
cans, and dead animals. Grenades and explosives have been thrown into
vehicles from overpasses, particularly in crowded areas. Travel should be
undertaken only when absolutely necessary and with the appropriate security=
.

The U.S. Embassy is located in the International Zone. The Embassy can
provide only limited emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq. At presen=
t
travel to and from the International Zone is extremely limited. The U.S.
Embassy does not provide visa services to the general public. American
citizens who choose to visit or reside in Iraq despite this Travel Warning
are urged to pay close attention to their personal security, avoid crowds,
especially rallies or demonstrations and to inform the U.S. Embassy of thei=
r
presence in Iraq. All Americans in Baghdad are strongly encouraged to
register with the Embassy at the following website
<https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/home.asp> :
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/home.asp.

American citizens may obtain the latest security information or other
information about Iraq by calling the U.S. Embassy, located in the
International Zone, at: 1-240-553-0584 x4354, or by e-mail:
usconsulbaghdad@state.gov or via the U.S. Embassy's website
<http://iraq.usembassy.gov> : http://iraq.usembassy.gov. Their after-hours
number is 1-914-822-5473.

Updated information on travel and security in Iraq may be obtained from the
Department of State by calling 1-888-407-4747 within the United States, or,
from overseas, 1-317-472-2328. For further information, please consult the
Consular Information Sheet for Iraq

There is a kind of fun in this discussion, and the delight of a lot of voices. I come from the kind of point of view of an
unreconstructed Sixties liberal ( I was only young at the time tho' - 13 in '68 etc) thus I tend to see things in terms of social
polity of let be what people will be, but though that is a very fuzzy vision, which I hold dear, which includes tolerance for
smokers, but not hard drugs, an aversion to cars, but a friendliness to trains and a deep fear (I am a Brit) of gun owners. Hope
that makes sense.
I also have a deep unease of anyone making proscriptive remarks about  social behaviour, although of course my unease would be
tempered (in my case) by people advocating unrestricted gun ownership, legalising hard drugs, or deregulating traffic so nobody had
to bother about speed limits (I have a particular sensitivity about this as my girlfriend has a partial disability and I know just
how frightening crossing the roads can be to her) but it's ok to criticise smokers but lets pretend drivers aren't a problem
(whoops, are the latest wars about control of oil fields or tobacco plantations?).
Of course smoking is a bad habit, and, yes, it does lay us in the hands of the corporations and the exchequer (unless of course you
live in working-class England where we have so many dodges you wouldn't ....) ahem, I never said that, but the corporations and the
governments infest everything we do, almost, buy, certainly, even Greenpeace is a brand name these days, so I have problems with
Ron's original post ( I understand from occasional remarks that he's a field manager for somebody or other, presumably his role, and
his poetic presence, involve a considerable expenditure of environmentally noxious substances into the world. Allen Ginsberg could
do his rant but he was quite close to becoming a corporate objet desire anyhow. The best remarks I've seen on this, which are many,
are Anny Ballardini's about smoking five fags while reading the stuff and Richard Tyler's superbly apposite quote from Auden:

        Private faces in public places
        Are wiser and nicer
        Than public faces in private places.

(it's doggerel poetry but it has a nice touch, as Auden sometimes can)

Best

>Aldon Nielsen=92s book Black Chant: Languages of African American
>Postmodernism was a ground-breaking work of scholarship that examined

>since the Second World War and their contributions to both African
>American culture and American modernism.
>
>
>Integral Music extends the terms of the studies begun in Black Chant

>decades following the Second World War. While Nielsen examines anew such
>key figures as Amiri Baraka, he also provides the first extended studies
>of significant but often overlooked figures in African American poetry,
>such as Russell Atkins and Stephen Jonas. His essay on Bob Kaufman
>points toward the critical intersection of poetry and jazz in African
>American letters, as does his essay on performance poet Jayne Cortez.

>
>Nielsen's studies in this volume affirm the importance and centrality of
>African American poets to American intellectual life and international,

I think you're thinking of the heroine of Samual Richardson's later
(epistolary) novel, _Clarissa_.

Huge military budgets, suppression of free speech, strong arm and any other
tactics to keep in office, a Youth Corps. to seed the future. Soon
Conservative students be on the march, wearing brown shirts, then black, and
liberal professors--"liberal" is the American right-wing word for "Jew,"
will be persecuted.
 We'll know if this is the direction of America next week.

I am honored, and once again, saddened to have just
learned that the late Michelle Reeves, who I
corresponded with too briefly, reviewed my chapbook on
her blog under the alias, Ala Bright.  Some of her own
keen and daring poems appear on the blog as well –
please take a look:
http://www.alabright.blogspot.com/

Michelle’s recent passing has caused me and many
others to pause and appreciate her kind gestures and
our own lives accordingly.  She wrote to us both
publicly and privately, posing questions and positing
her own poetic ideas in an eager manner.  At 20,
Michelle’s friendly approach was refreshing as well as
inspiring.  Her presence here is missed.

Poetics:

There was at one point some discussion on this list about the WTC site as
sacred ground, but search as I may I cannot find the thread. Can anyone recall
the discussion? I'm especially looking for the books on the topic of sacred
ground that several people (as I remember) recommended...And while I'm asking,
if anyone can think of particularly insightful commentaries on the 'Freedom
Towers' (Greedom Towers?) site and the redevelopment of lower Manhattan, do
let me know!

Back/frontchannel ok.


Thanks

Subject:      etymology of addiction
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Addiction is a word, a very powerful word. It's also a word ripe for the
likes of Dalachinsky.
If I were wealthy in a monetary sense, I'd commission him to dissect and
jumble it, rip it apart, re-assemble it, mutate, find incestuous relatives, and
let the orgy of alphabet and meanings begin.

The very roots of the word speak volumes - say, word, dictate, judge, give
over to, serve. The noun 'addict' only recently appeared in dictionaries,
although the verb was always there.

We had our paleo-chemists. Life's been hard. We've always found stuff to
harvest, brew, burn, inhale and eat to make the burdens lighter. Like everything
else, someone had to incorporate the stuff of dreaming and escape. We're both
consumer and product. There are a couple of poetic words for you. I think
customers and merchants will figure it all out. Better them than insurance
companies.

Now, we're addicted to language, but worse, to science and relativism. We're
intoxicated by and addicted to useless words which addict us to more of the
same. No way out. You're addiction is worse than my addiction. We're addicted to
death. While we're waiting it might be a simple act of kindness not to blow
smoke up everyone's ass, or at least not in everyone's face.

Dear Poetics List People,

I am going to be leaving New York from approximately December 21st until
March 1st and I'm looking for a sublettor who loves cats (I have 2) and can
pay $800 a month rent for a terrific one bedroom apartment in sunny downtown
Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I have stuff in my apartment, (books and more
books)-- so this would be good for someone new to the city, checking it out,
perhaps a young person/student of poetry.  It is a cozy place, close to the
L train, 15 minutes to the lower east side.  If you are interested, please
email me at jarnot@earthlink.net.  Rent and dates are somewhat negotiable.

thanks,
Lisa Jarnot

re this: that's flattering .. but that "doggerel" of Auden's...

 prefaces a brilliant, surely a great modernist/ proto-postmodernist poem -
sequence-book (in part of it (The Orators)) Auden utilises a kind of
Steinian language, also some prose, symbols etc (he was partly influenced by
hearing her Stein read or talk: but the book is quite variegated, quite a
mix of things: )..the Orators is a great poem/book which I feel Auden
wrongly seems to have disparaged - it is a mix of styles/methods - prose
poetry and so on and is quite immovative for its time I feel

( the "Private faces..." thing is good as you say but doesnt typify The
Orators - the style of which is complex and innovative)

The Approaching Hour

You Communists and Republicans!
all you Germans and Frenchmen!
you corpses and quickeners!
The stars are about to melt
and fall on you in tears.

Get ready! Get ready!
you Papists and Protestants!
you whores and you virtuous!
The moon will be bread
and drop presently into your baskets.

Friends and those who despise
and detest us!
Adventists and those who believe
nothing!
Get ready for the awakening.


Convivio

We forget sometimes that no matter what
our quarrels we are the same brotherhood:
the rain falling or the rain withheld,
--berated by women, barroom smells
or breath of Persian roses! our wealth
is words. And when we go down to defeat,
before the words, it is still within and
the concern of, first, the brotherhood.
Which should quiet us, warm and arm us
besides to attack, always attack--but to
reserve our worst blows for the enemy, those
who despise the word, flout it, stem,
leaves and root; the liars who decree laws
with no purpose other than to make a screen
of them for larceny, murder--for our
murder, we who salute the word and would
have it clean, full of sharp movement.


New Mexico

Anger can be transformed
to a kitten--as love
may become a mountain in
the disturbed mind, the
mind that prances like
a horse or nibbles, starts
and stares in the parched
sage of the triple
world--of stone, stone
layered and beaten under
the confessed brilliance
of this desert noon.


The Mind's Games

If a man can say of his life or
any moment of his life, There is
nothing more to be desired! his state
becomes like that told in the famous
double sonnet--but without the
sonnet's restrictions. Let him go look
at the river flowing or the bank
of late flowers, there will be one
small fly still among the petals
in whose gauzy wings raised above
its back a rainbow shines. The world
to him is radiant and even the fact
of poverty is wholly without despair.

So it seems until these rouse
to him pictures of the systematically
starved--for a purpose, at the mind's
proposal. What good then the
light winged fly, the flower or
the river--too foul to drink of or
even to bathe in? The 90 story building
beyond the ocean that a rocket
will span for destruction in a matter
of minutes but will not
bring him, in a century, food or
relief of any sort from his suffering.

The world too much with us? Rot!
the world is not half enough with us--
the rot of a potato with
a healthy skin, a rot that is
never revealed till we are about to
eat--and it revolts us. Beauty?
Beauty should make us paupers,
should blind us, rob us--for it
does not feed the sufferer but makes
his suffering a fly-blown putrescence
and ourselves decay--unless
the ecstasy be general.


Election Day

Warm sun, quiet air
an old man sits

in the doorway of
a broken house--

boards for windows
plaster falling

from between the stones
and strokes the head

of a spotted dog

Williams Volume II: 1939-1962*

distraught, i second and agree


i second and agree with Ryan here although he's not responsible for this
post and i dream of Canada. the past few days I've sent out what might be
my best image-work, certainly work relevant to our position today in terms
of both phenomenology and politics, no one comments on these works, there
might be a small spike, i don't know in website access. but what can i
expect, sending out so much work all the time, no matter what the quality.
it loses its relevance by surplus. it's useless like this post is useless.
occasionally a friend will reply, but that's all. at least i hope you're
ordering your neighbors to vote. this isn't a time for niceties. i third
and agree with Susanne here and would if possible stop the paranoia and
hatred, albeit my work is brilliant and invisible to you as is this post,
a form of mea culpa or bootstrap starting with an inconceivable ab nihilo
- the quantity of thinking that expresses itself outside the body returns
within, in the recent images which i have created, which are not so much
created as a kind of reportage on the state of interiority in relation to
digital incursion. of course one never knows what one misses and there are
my own personal attack dogs out there who will point out the disaster of
cross-posting, my evil in general, flooding their mailboxes with unwanted
spam. i fourth and agree with Murray here that they could simply place my
address in delete or kill or other filter, say procmail, as i have done
with them, in order to protect myself psychologically, since some of the
ugliest attacks have come personally to me at one or another conference, i
remember in particular a nasty smirking talentless individual who wanted
above all to appear in the know following like a dead dog after another
dead dog, perhaps there is no name for that. i am far too vulnerable to
these people whose idea of humanity is unbridled and highly applied
machismo in situation where discourse should be the rule of the day. i
fifth and agree with Carole that every text should stand on its own, that
every text is a file, that the entire digital world is composed of files,
of strings of symbols, ordered somewhat coherently in a world order that
exudes very little self-defense. not only is a chain determined by its
weakest link, but the weakest link also turns the rest of the chain into
literal garbage, polluting the earth, although otherwise perfectly fine,
which is one reason to recycle constantly, just as almost everything we
own is from one or another recycling, due to constant poverty and stress.
but i note that Tom or Jennifer will place a work up for gracious comment
and much discussion into the night and my form of daily dosage of tv's
worst journalist moments transformed into text goes almost entirely
unnoticed, as for one thing, it actually at times requires download or
attentive reading, and who has the time for that when probably half a
billion are online now or getting online, and spam reaches a good sixty to
eighty percent of all packets down the line. still i hunger as the
election approaches for a morsel of positivity that i'm doing something
right, instead of hearing from the usual attack dogs who surely could for
a moment change to hotmail and send me violent and uncontrollable email as
if my life were in danger, or my mental health, already suffering from the
incipient fascism in this country and trying, as we all are, to do
something about it. i am a president and i do what a president has to do.
i am an artist and i do what an artist has to do. we all have this
selfishness built into our genetic structures, however usually it's not so
much on the surface, most often there is a modicum of super-structural
cultural configurations on top of raw libido. political esthetics, wolves
on the attack both here and in real-space, even though the animals are
misused, some of the most beautiful on earth. i agree with James that the
same isn't true at all for the current human species, which is hardly
humane, none of us are, in any sense of the word, and perhaps i go farther
yet in praying for extinction, which the current regime in fact might
authorize or abet. the value of this is incalculable, since, if there is
no reason to save forests or whales, there is even less reason to save
ourselves, and in fact reason has very little to do with it. it's a matter
of taste, and mine goes to the majority, and it's a matter of the least
pain, and our elimination will certain savage the earth to a considerably
less degree than is going on now. i agree with Mark that this pessimism
might not be warranted, but there is little else, given the vagaries and
vandalization of power in the hands of a few, which will increasingly be
the case as the wealthy turn towards encasement and gated communities,
control and command and communication centers, the rest of us allowed to
fare in poisonous air and misguided weaponry. one man, one woman, one
atomic bomb, and one child, and nothing more is ever or will ever be
necessary. in the shadow of this, my misguided attempts at writing or
imaging or programming or sound or video, light or smell, scent or odor,
touch or travesty, lend themselves to nothing whatsoever, but it's my
genes speaking that keeps me on the move, hoping for a missive in return
and a kinder or more gentle one at that. i agree with Adrian that this is
hardly likely, that one has only so much time in the world, and the time
of the world seems increasingly limited, and how much attention can you
pay to any one human, and there are just so many minutes in the day. as
well, there is always the danger of repetition, or psychosis or neurosis
setting in, moving out of control so subtilely that it's hardly noticeable
until suddenly one awakens, as if from a dream, finding oneself in a field
of slaughter or unparalleled violence in the midst of an all-too-familiar
world. it's there that the missive arrives, in a ruined mailbox or inbox,
read by eyes almost blinded by a surfeit of ultraviolent, and it's there
that the last reprieve appears, for a minute, and almost a minute too
late. i agree with Eleanor that the time is always already gone in future
anterior, that the future has already happened. i am too late, myself, as
usual, and will not garner your respect.

DIRECTOR, POETRY IMPLEMENTATION
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF METAPHOR AND
PATHETIC FALLACY, DAKAR, PARNASSUS
PHONE: 00221 523 4715

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL!

DEAR FRIEND,

Based on the information gathered from the Ministry of Metaphor and Pathetic
Fallacy, we intend to solicit your assistance on this transaction with you
on the assumption that you will not disappoint us.

We have Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Poems (US
street value $25,500,000) which we have collected over time from
over-inflated anthologies in my war-torn country's Pantheon of Immortal
Poets.

We are seeking your assistance and permission to remit these poetries into
your account or any other nominated account you can provide for us. Your
commission will be 20% of the total syllabic count, 10% for allusive
gratuities, and the remaining 70% is for my colleagues, myself, and of
course the Muse.

Could you please notify me by coded villanelle of your acceptance to carry
out this transaction? Kindly and urgently, acknowledge the receipt of this
poetry by sending to me by email a copy of this letter with your private
ISBN and Library of Congress numbers. I shall in turn inform you of the
modalities for a formal application to secure the necessary approvals for
the immediate release of these poetries into your account.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Dr. Shelley Keats

Like the hip-hopsters say: word

Poems as coin of the realm? Might be a great idea. Better than plastic(s) and
stress. Of course that might create a new elitism. Where would that leave
those of us who write pretty poetry or clever poetry? Songwriters and graffiti
artists? I'm afraid the masses would starve to death, including many poets.
After all, how many people write poetry or even care to read it? Now if individual
words were coin only the most efficacious would be worth something. But wait.
Isn't that what critics, advertisers, politicians and terrorists already
know? Use as few power words as possible to get the required results. Maybe the
world is a victim of bad poetry already.

word - wyrd - weird

I understand Mary what you mean by addiction, and your dissacrating
tone, but I would take _words_ out of it, there is no addiction to
word, at least for those who study it seriously, there is love and
knowledge in the word,

there might be practice, and not all exercises are good, but they show
the wish to improve.

The less do I agree that we are addicted to death, otherwise we would
not be here. We are doomed to death, but not addicted. This posture is
a decrepit post-modernist one and I do not want it to stick to me,

Take care, Anny

cries in the sonorous jungle   framus unlegged
by wor(l)dless     legless hanging from pipes
her pipes proclaiming that NADA has arrived

it is a cold cold night
you walk toward the door as the wind
tries to push you back your beard blown s/ward
enters the frame
2 scraggle ends & a middle overgrown w/images
your name is muttered into my ear
i say it's just a rumor
but even rumors bear truthes like fish stories
anchors & war
some small truth within the larger frame
click shutter  captured hooked
the horn player  caught while..................
the piano player stopped at the keys

you are nowhere to be found
even with the woman you dream alive
singing syllables of noword to the floor

the back room is occupied by bodies
the front room is occupied by bodies
there is no more jungle
       cut to frame  ream the framus of its shields   &
       aim the shot    wander protected by amulets & videos
       where talking & motion & moving  go silent w/in the frame
       w/in the non-stop harsh voice
       an eye that bestly concretize
       can capture freezeframe on cold cold night

steam rising from the head of the maker
becoming fluid becoming steam becoming fluid
becoming steam again becoming what is - is a ghost
a host  of sorry sapiens  ray le monde & gross
warfly proclaims a wordless song 'at falls 'n rises  falls 'n
rises    falls 'n rises   falls 'n rises    falls 'n rises   ......

I fall all into lapse
judge     mental picture often confusing
more to myself then to people        what
could be more neurotic then truth at these times
it is difficult to live   weight wait or work it all ass backwords
discussion is quieter now, less full of heavy voices
my head maybe one good idea maybe less of good poetry
wonder why relapse is convenience & indirection more often
symbolic of friendship, few here or anywhere
but the page is always blank just one step ahead
relativity as spacing time to count out
meanwhile 1,000 leaves drop
for no good reason but what is natural
shifts with the newest book of language changing faster
now all good things differed Real as is as it is
now time to find something usefull to expose
within a picture left no story in its vaults. Tell
me something that rings at my door.

Which is pretty easy to find out, by opening a dictionary.  It's a Latin import, by way of the English Renaissance, from 'addictus'
the child of 'addicere', meaning originally to be given over or assigned by decree, by law ('ad' plus 'dicere' - appoint, allot) and
thence from the base meaning of a formal binding it becomes figuratively, in the hands of those nuisances the 16th & 17th century
English poets, a personal rather than a legal act 'addicted to melancholy' (Twelfth Night) etc etc.

Below's the etymology of "addiction" from the OED.

Best,
Joseph

[ad. L. addictin-em, n. of action f. addc-re; see
ADDICT.]

    1. Rom. Law. A formal giving over or delivery by
sentence of court. Hence, A surrender, or dedication,
of any one to a master.

  1625 T. GODWIN Rom. Antiq. 170 The forme of
Addiction was thus..the party which preuailed, laid
his hand on the thing or the person against which
sentence was pronounced vsing this forme of words,
Hunc ego hominem siue hanc rem ex iure Quiritium meam
esse dico. 1735 BP. PATRICK On Exodus xx. 6 Look upon
it only as a solemn Addiction of him to his Master's
Service. 1751 CHAMBERS Cycl., Adjudication is more
particularly used for the addiction, or consigning a
thing sold by auction, or the like, to the highest
bidder. 1880 MUIRHEAD Gaius iii. §189 Whether this
addiction made him a slave..was a point of controversy
with the old lawyers.

    2. a. The state of being (self-)addicted or given
to a habit or pursuit; devotion.

  1641 Vind. Smectym. ii. 43 The peoples..more willing
addiction to hearing. 1675 E. PHILLIPS in Shaks. Cent.
Praise 360 His own proper Industry and Addiction to
Books. 1789 T. JEFFERSON Writings (1859) II. 585 Such
an addiction is the last degradation of a free and
moral agent. 1858 GLADSTONE Stud. Homer I. 237 Their
addiction to agricultural pursuits. 1859 MILL Liberty
146 A man who causes grief to his family by addiction
to bad habits.

    b. The, or a, state of being addicted to a drug
(see ADDICTED ppl. a. 3b); a compulsion and need to
continue taking a drug as a result of taking it in the
past. Cf. drug-addiction s.v. DRUG n.1 1b.

  [1779 JOHNSON L.P., Philips Wks. II. 291 His
addiction to tobacco is mentioned by one of his
biographers.] 1906 Jrnl. Amer. Med. Assoc. 3 Mar.
643/2 It matters little whether one speaks of the
opium habit, the opium disease or the opium addiction.
1951 A. GROLLMAN Pharmacol. & Therapeutics iv. 97
Addiction refers to that condition induced by a drug
which necessitates the continuation of the drug and
without which physical and mental derangements result.

drugs for the new experience, they largely steer clear
of being hooked by an addiction. 1965 New Statesman 3
Dec. 868/1 Addiction units tend not to be aware of the
addict's tremendous need for moral support when the

Mary Jo Malo, Anny Ballardini have been discussing the word
"addiction" is a way that is richly resonant to my way of thinking.
When I reread some of the posts tonight,
including that of Joseph Thomas, I thought about another word:
*sanctimonious* and checked the thesaurus: a few synonyms include:
pietistic, pious, preachy, self-satisfied, smug, stuffy, unctuous. Further
delving even includes the word "born again." There is something achingly,
painfully sanctimonious about the way the word "addiction" is frequently
used. When words are used in a sanctimonious way their users take on their
characteristics:  pietistic, pious, preachy, self-satisfied, smug, stuffy,
unctuous. Can the word "addiction" ever be used again
without its sanctimonious overtones?  Perhaps the word "addiction" itself
has been irreversibly contaminated by its contemporary superficial overuse.

descendant of Cerdic, King of the West Saxons, first Saxon king in 519.

Our President, George Walker Bush, is the direct decsendant of Kings
Cerdic, Egbert, Aelthelwulf, Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder, William
the Conqueror, Henry I, Robert I Bruce, and Robert II Stuart, and the
son of George Herbert Walker Bush. He is the direct descendant of two
distinct monarchies of England, that of Egbert and of William the
Conqueror.

********************************

"The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth; for kings are
not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but
even by God himself are called gods. There be three principal
similitudes that illustrate the state of monarchy: one taken out of the
word of God; and the two other out of the grounds of policy and
philosophy. In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their power
after a certain relation compared to the divine power. Kings are also
compared to fathers of families: for a king is truly Parens patriae, the
politique father of his people. And lastly, kings are compared to the
head of this microcosm of the body of man.

"Kings are justly called gods, for that they exercise a manner or
resemblance of divine power upon earth: for if you will consider the
attributes to God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a king.
God hath power to create or destrov make or unmake at his pleasure, to
give life or send death, to judge all and to be judged nor accountable
to none; to raise low things and to make high things low at his
pleasure, and to God are both souls and body due. And the like power
have kings: they make and unmake their subjects, thev have power of
raising and casting down, of life and of death, judges over all their
subjects and in all causes and yet accountable to none but God only. . .
.

"I conclude then this point touching the power of kings with this axiom
of divinity, That as to dispute what God may do is blasphemy....so is it
sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his
power. But just kings will ever be willing to declare what they will do,
if they will not incur the curse of God. I will not be content that my
power be disputed upon; but I shall ever be willing to make the reason
appear of all my doings, and rule my actions according to my laws. . . I
would wish you to be careful to avoid three things in the matter of
grievances:

"First, that you do not meddle with the main points of government; that
is my craft . . . to meddle with that were to lesson me . . . I must not
be taught my office.

"Secondly, I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine
as I have received from my predecessors . . . . All novelties are
dangerous as well in a politic as in a natural body. and therefore I
would be loath to be quarreled in my ancient rights and possessions, for
that were to judge me unworthy of that which my predecessors had and
left me.

"And lastly, I pray you beware to exhibit for grievance anything that is
established by a settled law, and whereunto . . . you know I will never
give a plausible answer; for it is an undutiful part in subjects to
press their king, wherein they know beforehand he will refuse them."

        From King James I, Works, (1609).

***************************************

William the Conqueror is the son of Robert I "the Devil," Duke of
Normandy.

***************************************

King Edward the Confessor is the great-great-great grandson of King
Alfred the Great.

King Harold II is the son of King Edward the Confessor.

King William I the Conqueror killed King Harold II and took his throne.

George Walker Bush is the direct descendant of two families who tried to
kill one another for the throne of England.

***************************************

Emperor Charlemagne, great^42 uncle of George Walker Bush, is son of
Pepin III, King of the Franks, and part of the House of Pepin. Three of
Charlemagne's sons became Kings, of Neustria, Aquitaine, and Italy. His
Grandchildren include another King of Italy, King of Germany, King of
Aquitaine, King of Neustria, and Emperors Lothair I & Charles the Bald
(also King of Aquitaine). Charlemagne's direct descendants include
Emperors Guido, Lambert, Louis II, Louis II, and the French kings
Charles II the Fat of France, Charles III the Simple, Louis II, III, IV,
V, Lothair, and King Arnulf of Germany. Arnulf's direct descendants (the
Welf and Hohenstaufen families) include at least two popes and Emperors
Henry IV, V, VI, Conrad III & IV, Frederick I and II, Philip, and Otto
IV. From Philip is descended the House of Castile, which includes
Ferdinand II, King of Aragon and sponsor of Christopher Columbus.
Ferdinand's two grandchildren, Emperors Charles I (later Emperor Charles
V), and Ferdinand I, are the children of Philip of Hapsburg and serve as
the patriarchs of the Spanish and Austrian Hapsburg families,
respectively.

Hapsburg literally means, "Hawk's Castle."

***************************************

George Washington, like George Bush, is a direct descendant of King
Egbert who married into the Charlemagne dynasty. He is descended through
two family lineages that managed to come together after 1000 years. This
makes them distant cousins. Interestingly enough, Washington is ALSO
directly descended from William the Conqueror. In fact, the Charlemagne
family is interlaced with the pre-Norman Invasion English Kings (re:
inbred). Franklin Delano Roosevelt is directly descended from the
Charlemagne dynasty, from Egbert and from William. Roosevelt is also a
direct descendant of the Polish King Mieszko I, Danish King Svend I, and
English King Merfyn. Interestingly enough, Roosevelt father AND mother
are both direct descendants of William the Conqueror. James Monroe is
the great^12 grandson of King James I Stuart. And so on and on....

October 26, 2004

Neil Stonechild was in the custody of two Saskatoon police officers on
the last night he was seen alive, and injuries he suffered likely were
caused by police handcuffs.

The investigation into Neil's death was superficial and totally inadequate.
"The principal Investigator assigned to the case, Morality Sergeant
Keith Jarvis, carried out a superficial and totally inadequate
investigation of the death of Neil Stonechild."

Those are among the findings of the Commission of Inquiry whose report
was made public today.

P.S. addiction?  like that's a word that needs it's root explained, e.g. =
most Texas voters are addicted to the GOP party line these days.   Could =
it be any more clear?  Vote!  and vote anti-Texan...addict yourself!

  Subject: etymology of addiction


  Mary Jo Malo, Anny Ballardini have been discussing the word
  "addiction" is a way that is richly resonant to my way of thinking.
  When I reread some of the posts tonight,
  including that of Joseph Thomas, I thought about another word:
  *sanctimonious* and checked the thesaurus: a few synonyms include:
  pietistic, pious, preachy, self-satisfied, smug, stuffy, unctuous. =
Further
  delving even includes the word "born again." There is something =
achingly,
  painfully sanctimonious about the way the word "addiction" is =
frequently
  used. When words are used in a sanctimonious way their users take on =
their
  characteristics:  pietistic, pious, preachy, self-satisfied, smug, =
stuffy,
  unctuous. Can the word "addiction" ever be used again
  without its sanctimonious overtones?  Perhaps the word "addiction" =
itself
  has been irreversibly contaminated by its contemporary superficial =
overuse.

Most of what I can deduce from the "vault" demonstration of the Bush clan's
ancestral lines - at least in relation to George W. Bush - is that genetic
training (or streaming) is an inexact art. It's true you probably stand a
better chance at becoming a/the monarch, but how one performs in the
position is a consequence of other variables such as intelligence, rude
psychology and emotion.

Ancestrally speaking - in comparison to the Bushes - Bill Clinton appears to
be a sheer diamond in the rough. His apparent predilection - as well - for
intimately sharing his genetic stream with others and without class
prejudice also appears quite different than what we know of the Bushes.

Yet, on more than one occasion, Clinton - as Bush - also exercised the
State's right to murder. Whether Clinton thought it was his divine
responsibility, or, that he was just doing his job "to protect the American
people", I am suspect the latter.

I am also pretty sure that if President Clinton thought his exercise of
State power -  in the way of the potential for civilian mass murder in
Fallujah, Iraq, for example - became a transparently counter-productive and
stupid thing to do, as well as morally wrong - he would probably reconsider
his command and commitment.

Patrick, I was a sophist in a previous life (!) and now - like I imagine
most of us - I am jittering towards Tuesday's election without a real clue
as to what's going to happen! All I know is that if Bush is re-elected our
collective and individual genes are likely to get fucked up real bad - worst
than the worstest poem, novel or short story any of us probably ever read.

I say vote, vote often, vote well - but I guess we can't do that.

May the best man...

>King Robert II Stuart is the grandson of King Robert I Bruce.<

who, what, when?????

There's never been a King Robert of England, whether Stuart or not, and only the very temporary House of Stuart tried the divine
right stuff, with unfortunate consequences for one's neck, over here.

Kings of Scotland of course don't count (as Robin might explain) as they are mere subsidiaries (grin)

The difference is between the good cop and the bad cop. Its tragic that the
US/any country has to put up with...........

The probabilities are in favour of the US moving somewhat toward
civilisation  if Bush is kicked out. But the difference is not great.

But if I was a US citizen I would vote for Kerry, but continue to organise
against capitalism and imperialism.

This is not (as dave the Brummie illiterate implies) a laughing matter.

Leave aside one's prejudices against the Stuart Dynasty, the *proper* way of
referring to the drooling nincumpoop who crossed the border in 1603 and
promptly Towered Walter Ralegh for a bad pun is "James the Sixth and First"
...

[Pedantically, and as an afterthought, technically it was Jimmy who made the
pun -- "I hae heard somewhat rawly of you" -- but given that Walter Ralegh
was wandering around the corridors of Westminster while Elizabeth was dying
("She was a lady whom time surprised") muttering that even a republic would
be better than to have that Scots bampot on the throne, I suppose you can't
really blame Jimmy for slapping him in the Tower and then later selling him
out to the Spaniards.]

(He was the sixth king called James to reign in Scotland, only two of whom
died in their beds and James IV actually wrote quite a decent poem -- The
Kingis Quair -- before he inspected a canon [cannon?] which hadn't been
beta-tested and got blown to buggery.)

... not James I (though he was the first James to reign in England) nor
James I and IV (since he was Jimmy the Six in Scotland *well* before he
skipped south.

Strictly speaking (and even I'm nae sae pedantic as to insist on this) Our
Current Beloved Monarch is Elizabeth the First [of Britain] and Second [of
England].

As I say, no a laffin matter ...

        ... When Alexander our king was dead ...

                Come back Sandy, all is forgiven.

I won't go on to point-out that the two high heid yins of the so-called
"Labour" party -- Brown and Blair -- are both Scottish, as is Charles
Kennedy, leader of the Lib Dems.

If you factor-in the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael
something-of-the-night Howard, who is the Jewish son of a Polish refugee,
you begin to wonder whether Britain can actually field a single True-Born
Englishman.

(Bit like football, eh?  I mean *proper* football, whit youz yins in the
States wid caw "soccer", but.)

Oh, sorry, I forgot about UKIP (hey, Britain is now a four-party state --
come on proportional representation, all is forgiven), Robert Kilroy Silk.

A big cigar to anyone who can name the *official* leader of UKIP (the United
Kingdom Independence Party, a right bunch of wankers and chancers) -- even I
can't, and I live here.

And as the final cherry on the pudding, one of the few things that dave and
I agree on, is that the worst thing to happen to British politics was that
John Smith snuffed it.

And he was Scottish too.

Subject:      the etymology of etymology & addiction
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Etymology: Latin from the Greek; etymon + ology, the discourse or description
of the true or literal sense of a word according to its etymon. Etymon comes
from the Greek word for true, real and probably derives from a Sanksrit word
for true, satya, from which the English word sooth is also derived. "The origin
or derivation of a word as shown by its analysis into elements, by pointing
out the root or primitive form in its parent language; also, an account setting
forth such origin or derivation, often with facts bearing upon the word's
relationships; the formal history of a word." - Webster's New International
Dictionary 1929

The roots: ad + dicere = to say, (and then) to adjudge, devote. So, the
original and now obsolete use of the word was relevant to Roman Law: to adjudge, to
deliver under decree of court, and then figuratively, to give over or
surrender to.

Now it only appears that the figurative use of the word addiction has passed
into common usage, but is that wholly true? The idea that one surrendered and
was devoted to a negative addiction still retained an element of intent or
control on the part of the person. It would seem that the root of say and adjudge
(thus it is written/spoken, thus it shall be) was always lurking and then
ultimately reasserted by science. Addiction became a sentence, an inevitable
decree. The singular noun form of the word for a long time was addiction, not
addict. People were addicted to this or that, but they weren't addicts.

We have a bad habit (sorry) of defining people by their addictions. This is
the new power given to an already intrinsically powerful word. We say so-and-so
is an addict or -oholic, because they are obsessive or compulsive (more
psych-power) about a particular activity. Does the word addict itself actually
cause or prolong the behavior? Is the word now invested with a condemnatory
quality, the judgment component it had originally?

This is my fascination with words, their etymology, how they change,
sometimes into their opposite meanings, like 'cleave'. We have trouble communicating
because words mean different things to different folks. We react emotionally to
words, as if we have a relevant encyclopedic history of pain or joy with
them. If people create words and their meanings, evolve them over time, people
have more power than they think. They're not helpless and might be capable of
affecting positive change. That's my hope anyway, in the words and the people who
create and wield them. 'To say the words in wings and fly.' Words should free
and enable us.

I'm addicted to 'life' and 'love'. That's what my body tells me. Those words
are entire libraries, Alexandrian. What is the addiction and persistent
language of politics and science? Allen G. was right. There are a lot better things
to be addicted to, to put in our mouths.

You don't suppose the Bushes buy into that Merovingian-Carolinian-Holy Blood
story, do you? If you throw in the Stuarts, who are the rightful heirs of the
British throne by the way, they might doubly trace a lineage back to Jesus
himself. The arrogance and mythopoetic ironies are impressive. What would the
relevance of a military messiah (Dubya a messianic Jew?) be for Americans, the
Israeli's, Saudi's, Al-qaeda? Do you think they'll bring forth DNA evidence?
Regretably, I know firsthand of the fundamentalist apocalytic perspective. Those
who have seized the reign of power, via that little coup in Florida four years
ago, can easily justify any tactics to keep those reins. God's law is higher
than man's law and all that rubbish. You can't really believe these men
believe in democracy and freedom when it's cost Iraqis an estimated 100,000 lives so
far, not to mention American lives, and billions of dollars. It's just all
too complex and ridiculous for us old folks to figure out. Are we safer? Osama
still sending us promos? They really took care of him, didn't they? They sure
took care of our Bill of Rights. They sure learned how to tweak free enterprise.

I'm watching the youth vote. It's the only thing I'm energized about. It's
their future afterall. Let's see if they can stop the selling of America and the
rest of the 'developing' world. Do they have the equipment, the language, the
desire, the work ethic, the will to live? I hope so.

Will we have ballotage? Now there's a word for you, ballot. A little ball to
represent a vote. Once again, I suggest there's a poem in here somewhere.
Counting balls might be more reliable than our high tech voting machines; but like
Stalin said, it's the counters that have the real power. Have we lost forever
our confidence in the possibility of democracy? Is this a point of no return?
Has power corrupted absolutely?

Whisper Gallery by Kip Knott

Kip Knott's poetry has appeared in numerous print and electronic journals,
including 5_Trope, Gettysburg Review, Poems & Plays, Poet Lore, and The
Sun. His chapbook The Weight of Smoke was published by Bottom Dog Press.
In addition to writing poetry, he has written screenplays and stories. His
most recent story appeared in Beloit Fiction Journal. His screenplay
Somewhere Not Home won him an Individual Artist Fellowship from the Ohio
Arts Council. After many years as a transient teacher moving from Ohio to
Alaska, Alaska to Iowa, Iowa to Oklahoma, he found his way back to Ohio
where he now lives with his wife and son and teaches at Columbus State
Community College.

Whisper Gallery has in it twenty-five Kip Knott poems. Here is one:


Wake

After everything they've done, he still looks
dead, and we still touch his dusty cheek
with our moist lips. The children of the family--
nieces, nephews, cousins--parade past the coffin
like strangers on a tour of some landmark or other.
I forget which one of them I carried
on my shoulders, which one of them pulled
on my beard before gray hairs conquered brown.

And yet, we move together in one direction,
like memories from childhood. My memories
are sure to go unspoken later over hot dishes of food
other strangers dropped off earlier. Like the time
I stole his toupee for Halloween. Or the way he stole
quick smokes in the bathroom even after cancer
cost him half a lung. Or all the tips he never left
whenever he treated me and my wife to dinner.

I clench my fists and tighten my jaw
when my sister the infidel stumbles over
prayers she's asked to read at the last minute,
ashamed of her for such a display of emotion.
My mother touches her sleeve, dabs her eyes.
All is kindness when it no longer matters.
When it's over we turn our backs to him
and walk away just as if he were still alive.


Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Robin - thanks for your great sense/knowledge and 'pedantry' here. I will
take it! Those upstart Scots!
Gosh =AD of what are my own partly Scottish ancestors, Protestant Calvinists,
they were  driven out (from Argyleshire) via Derry, Ireland and off to New
Hampshire (New Derry)  about 1640 - then, as Loyalists(!) - =B3One George is
as good as another=B2 - to New Brunswick (St. Andrews) in the Revolution and
then to California (Eureka)  in 1870 - known always for building ships,
cabinets, bridges, urban planning and, running for and holding local
political office.  Must be in the genes!  Poetry, my grandfather could
recite Burns by heart. But 'creative writing' - actually writing it, a
'program' (circa 1961) - "that must be something Democrats do."

I wish I could have told him it was a Divine Right. Or, real work.

Fortunately- I assume-  of the above decided or tried to run for President.
But several, over the years, have been cause for poems.

Thanks again,

As part of *1-Year Plan*, I have posted my talk at last week's Modernist
Studies conference in Vancouver, an essay on "Left Modernism/Social
Articulation/Permanent Avant-garde" that begins with the importance of
modernism in Fredric Jameson's work and goes on to a series of examples
from Diego Rivera to conceptual photographer Richard Bolton to Detroit
playwright Ron Allen.

<<
Robin - thanks for your great sense/knowledge and 'pedantry' here. I will
take it! Those upstart Scots!
>>

Thanks for the compliment, Stephen, especially as it comes in the wake of an
email elsewhere that seemed to accuse me of political pusilinamity because I
was arguing for Symbolic Logic as against Aristotelian Binary Logic.

...  I *mean*, about how far away from politics can you get?

            :-(

<<
I wish I could have told him it was a Divine Right. Or, real work.
>>

... oh, another wee bit of pedantry, simply because it's in my head ...

The earliest recorded use of the term "divine right (of Kings)" is by
Richard Hooker in Book Seven of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.

The OED [(2)3] gives the earliest cite to Hooker as a1600 {sic}, (by which
time [Bk 7 was only published in the 1640s] Hooker had been dead for forty
years.

Now that might seem fairly simple, except that when Hooker publishes Books
One and Two in [I think] 1598, the bloody title-page asserted that it was
books 1-8, and Book Seven was only published *after* (also postumously) Book
Eight.

The reason I know this obscure and utterly irrelevant piece of information
is that my American ex-fiancee emailed me to say that NAME DELETED pulled
her up on her use of the term while she was doing something mildly obscene
{bloody Mitlonists} on Jimmy the Sixth's _Basilicon Doron_, and was this
correct?

My immediate reaction was to say that NAME DELETED was dead right, and the
first person to use the term {not the concept -- the idea of subordination
and magistracy and annointed kings goes way back) was Jimmy.

Then it occurred to me to check this, and then it went truly hairy.

I mean, try looking up the Shorter New Cambridge Bibliography of English
Literature in the middle of a transatlantic phone call ...

Carol owes me a footnote on this one and NAME DELETED is prolly laughing
himself sick.

So there.

Da Pedant.

(Oh incidentally, Jimmy prolly *didn't* translate the Psalms of David -- I
picked this information up inter alia while chasing the standard edited text
of Basilicon for Carol.

In the unlikely event that anyone is remotely interested, try Craigie's
editions for the STS.

The conceit here is not English kings (note: Charlemagne, Pepin III, Mieszco I, Lothair, Arnulf, etc.) but royalty in general.

Even the Divine Right of Kings idea is not English (Jacques-Benigne Bossuet).

A few years ago I heard about a collection of American writers, writing on the
subject of what America means to them. The collection, a post-9/11 publication
of the State Department, was intended for overseas distribution. Because the
publication was considered an article of propaganda, it was not available for
print distribution in the US. Two prominent poets, Robert Creeley and Robert
Pinsky, are among those writing in the collection. Given the lessons of the Nazi
art aesthetic, as well as the Right's stance against the arts, it struck me as
odd at the time that any American poet would lend a hand to nationalism.

Several months passed and the worst of the rabid cheerleading began to die down.
The Boston Globe ran a profile of a group of poets reading in opposition to the
war in Cambridge, Mass. One of these was Robert Pinsky. This dichotic was not
easy on the ears. It came to mind again this morning as I read the new issue of
Poets & Writers (Nov/Dec 2004), which includes an article on the International
Library of Poetry's attempt to gain legitimacy by enlisting celebrated poets as
paid spokespersons. One of those taking the check is Robert Pinsky.

As odd as it seemed for Pinsky to be in the an anti-war reading just a few
months after appearing in the State Department's propaganda piece, it is
baffling to see this very closed-door academic opening to support the
questionable and laughable ILP. It is a disappointment when recognized poets,
who have the greatest chance to lead, take their mentorship from those with the
opportunity and means to populate the classrooms, directly to the exploited
dilettantes of the ILP, leapfrogging over that great underclass of talented
poets in between.

&gt; <BR>
&gt; Our President, George Walker Bush, is the direct decsendant of
Kings<BR>
&gt; Cerdic, Egbert, Aelthelwulf, Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder,
William<BR>
&gt; the Conqueror, Henry I, Robert I Bruce, and Robert II Stuart, and
the<BR>
&gt; son of George Herbert Walker Bush. He is the direct descendant of
two<BR>
&gt; distinct monarchies of England, that of Egbert and of William the<BR>
&gt; Conqueror.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; ********************************<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth; for
kings are<BR>
&gt; not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne,
but<BR>
&gt; even by God himself are called gods. There be three principal<BR>
&gt; similitudes that illustrate the state of monarchy: one taken out of
the<BR>
&gt; word of God; and the two other out of the grounds of policy and<BR>
&gt; philosophy. In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their
power<BR>
&gt; after a certain relation compared to the divine power. Kings are
also<BR>
&gt; compared to fathers of families: for a king is truly Parens patriae,
the<BR>
&gt; politique father of his people. And lastly, kings are compared to
the<BR>
&gt; head of this microcosm of the body of man.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;Kings are justly called gods, for that they exercise a manner
or<BR>
&gt; resemblance of divine power upon earth: for if you will consider
the<BR>
&gt; attributes to God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a
king.<BR>
&gt; God hath power to create or destrov make or unmake at his pleasure,
to<BR>
&gt; give life or send death, to judge all and to be judged nor
accountable<BR>
&gt; to none; to raise low things and to make high things low at his<BR>
&gt; pleasure, and to God are both souls and body due. And the like
power<BR>
&gt; have kings: they make and unmake their subjects, thev have power of<BR>
&gt; raising and casting down, of life and of death, judges over all
their<BR>
&gt; subjects and in all causes and yet accountable to none but God only. .
.<BR>
&gt; .<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;I conclude then this point touching the power of kings with this
axiom<BR>
&gt; of divinity, That as to dispute what God may do is blasphemy....so is
it<BR>
&gt; sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of
his<BR>
&gt; power. But just kings will ever be willing to declare what they will
do,<BR>
&gt; if they will not incur the curse of God. I will not be content that
my<BR>
&gt; power be disputed upon; but I shall ever be willing to make the
reason<BR>
&gt; appear of all my doings, and rule my actions according to my laws. . .
I<BR>
&gt; would wish you to be careful to avoid three things in the matter of<BR>
&gt; grievances:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;First, that you do not meddle with the main points of government;
that<BR>
&gt; is my craft . . . to meddle with that were to lesson me . . . I must
not<BR>
&gt; be taught my office.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;Secondly, I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of
mine<BR>
&gt; as I have received from my predecessors . . . . All novelties are<BR>
&gt; dangerous as well in a politic as in a natural body. and therefore
I<BR>
&gt; would be loath to be quarreled in my ancient rights and possessions,
for<BR>
&gt; that were to judge me unworthy of that which my predecessors had
and<BR>
&gt; left me.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;And lastly, I pray you beware to exhibit for grievance anything
that is<BR>
&gt; established by a settled law, and whereunto . . . you know I will
never<BR>
&gt; give a plausible answer; for it is an undutiful part in subjects to<BR>
&gt; press their king, wherein they know beforehand he will refuse
them.&quot;<BR>

&gt; ***************************************<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Emperor Charlemagne, great^42 uncle of George Walker Bush, is son
of<BR>
&gt; Pepin III, King of the Franks, and part of the House of Pepin. Three
of<BR>
&gt; Charlemagne's sons became Kings, of Neustria, Aquitaine, and Italy.
His<BR>
&gt; Grandchildren include another King of Italy, King of Germany, King
of<BR>
&gt; Aquitaine, King of Neustria, and Emperors Lothair I &amp; Charles the
Bald<BR>
&gt; (also King of Aquitaine). Charlemagne's direct descendants include<BR>
&gt; Emperors Guido, Lambert, Louis II, Louis II, and the French kings<BR>
&gt; Charles II the Fat of France, Charles III the Simple, Louis II, III,
IV,<BR>
&gt; V, Lothair, and King Arnulf of Germany. Arnulf's direct descendants
(the<BR>
&gt; Welf and Hohenstaufen families) include at least two popes and
Emperors<BR>
&gt; Henry IV, V, VI, Conrad III &amp; IV, Frederick I and II, Philip, and
Otto<BR>
&gt; IV. From Philip is descended the House of Castile, which includes<BR>
&gt; Ferdinand II, King of Aragon and sponsor of Christopher Columbus.<BR>
&gt; Ferdinand's two grandchildren, Emperors Charles I (later Emperor
Charles<BR>
&gt; V), and Ferdinand I, are the children of Philip of Hapsburg and serve
as<BR>
&gt; the patriarchs of the Spanish and Austrian Hapsburg families,<BR>
&gt; respectively.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Hapsburg literally means, &quot;Hawk's Castle.&quot;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; ***************************************<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; George Washington, like George Bush, is a direct descendant of King<BR>
&gt; Egbert who married into the Charlemagne dynasty. He is descended
through<BR>
&gt; two family lineages that managed to come together after 1000 years.
This<BR>
&gt; makes them distant cousins. Interestingly enough, Washington is
ALSO<BR>
&gt; directly descended from William the Conqueror. In fact, the
Charlemagne<BR>
&gt; family is interlaced with the pre-Norman Invasion English Kings
(re:<BR>
&gt; inbred). Franklin Delano Roosevelt is directly descended from the<BR>
&gt; Charlemagne dynasty, from Egbert and from William. Roosevelt is also
a<BR>
&gt; direct descendant of the Polish King Mieszko I, Danish King Svend I,
and<BR>
&gt; English King Merfyn. Interestingly enough, Roosevelt father AND
mother<BR>
&gt; are both direct descendants of William the Conqueror. James Monroe
is<BR>
&gt; the great^12 grandson of King James I Stuart. And so on and on....<BR>

****************************

The above use of the word "addicted" to indicate ongoing
enthusiasm can surely be contrasted, for example,
to the statement, on the part of a recovered heroin
addict of my acquaintance, who said to me not long
ago: "relationships, when you are an addict,
are all compromised, because the primary love
object for an addict is their drug of choice." This person
overcame his addiction after ongoing use for over
25 years.

Of course it is possible to use words that have technical
meanings in a medical or scientific sense, in a casual way.
A contemporary example is the use of the world "paranoid"
to mean "suspicious."

This is absorbing thread for me because it evokes an issue
that I've been thinking about as a result of some discussions
among bloggers recently about words and  thinking.

Confronting oneself concerning issues of habit and choice
involves using words. I have the feeling that confronting
oneself or someone else about an addiction may be very useful, but that this
process itself can  become addicting, and thereby enter into and participate
with the cycle of addiction, anxiety about addiction, ambivalence, and
further anxiety leading to further addiction.

It seems to me that the usefulness of words in thinking,
including thinking about personal choices, involves also
confronting their limited application within the sphere of emotions
and rationalizations.  Ambivalence, it could be said, involves
doing too much thinking, i.e., worrying; thinking, that is, without
coming to a definitive conclusion.

I believe words are necessary for the achievement
of insight and change, but not sufficient. It appears that firm
decisions also involve connecting insight gained through
comprehension by means of the application of words, to drawing a
conclusion, making a decision, and then
realizing that at least some crucial aspect of the matter is settled, and
taking action.

My Friend,
       I've been in London a little over a month now.
Just spent the day
drawing in the British Museum. The collection is
fantastic of course. Too
bad I can't draw worth a shit. Its especially too bad
because, assuming I
had some kind of talent, I always elected not to learn
anything about
anything else. I'm super fuckin depressed man. My work
totally pedestrian.
The kind of provincial rubbish I'm capable of only
makes the cut in the
provinces. I don't know a damn thing about making art.
I'm a cowardly,
phrase mongering, imbecile. Being here is really
searching me out, into my
deepest corners. All the deficiencies of my character,
so long nurtured on
fear and resentment in a dirty little Canadian oil
town, cannot help but
find expression in my art. Spent all my teens stoned,
my twenties drunk.
Proud, huaghty, afraid of love and life, mistaking my
childish feelings and
prejudices for ideas. Its caught up-- I'm fucked. Feel
like I'm
disappearing. Sorry man. Listen, I don't know if i'm
just trolling for
affirmation or what. This is whats going on. Not
really sure what to do. I'm
gonna be in London for a year I guess. Shitty way to
resume our
correspondence, i know. just kinda swirling around the
drain tonight. Whats
this thing I can't cut loose of in my life or my work?
Anyway, guess thats
about enough petulant self loathing for one message.
Drop me a line man.
London is lonely as hell and twice as expensive.

Bradley,
Thanks for getting back so fast. A couple bad drawing
sessions can
really unleash the blackest states of
mind-body-spirit. Though it doesn’t
always require bad drawing sessions. Hey, I like those
fuckin pomes. Keep
that stuff coming. I sometimes need reminding that
there is something to be
done w/ these apprenticeships. Something outside of
the formal concerns of
the life drawing room and hoping my stuff looks
'right'. Drawing is a
language. My drawing language has pretty much been
gutterspeak. Learning a
language is difficult. I'm spending my days in front
of the statuary of the
B.M. and the paintings in the National Gallery and i'm
just goo goo ga ga
and shitting myself and peeing in the potted plants
cuz I can't fucking
speak like in these languages that surround me.
Learning is hard for the
proud. Good to hear from you. Write when possible.
Yeah, I too, fight
depression w/the Bible (though not Marx). When I
remember. Take care.
yours in constant recovery,

Bill

Nick,

To me, it seems that one question is not settled. What defines addiction, wh=
o=20
determines something is an addiction. For instance, people go to work every=20
day. Does that make it an addiction? Doesn't addiction imply going against=20
society's limits, more specifically, "non or anti-productive" labor?=20

What if one rejects the negative connotations attached to the word? I do not=
=20
think we can assume as self-evident that we know or agree on what addiction=20
is.

The lesson of WORDS is that only what is ungraspable
can truly be grasped, the poet alone is at her leisure
among these ambiguous emblematic spoils. I live in
constant fear of ADDICTION. I lack the imaginative
capacity to speak with SUBTLETY. And LANGUAGE
continues to reduce me to its humble servant, its
user, its junkie. This is junkstore PHILOSOPHY. This
is BAD POETRY. It knows it has no OBJECT it knows no
ENJOYMENT. “Whosoever seizes the greatest UNREALITY
will shape the greatest REALITY.” I am addicted to
THOUGHT.  If I RECOGNIZE this I will become
MELANCHOLIC. Our PUBLIC language has never been
PRIVATE property. The RADICAL ABOLITION of my WILL to
SUCCEED is POLITICAL. But it’s also NOT POLITICAL. . I
want LANGUAGE but I don't lead to it. LANGUAGE wants
SHE but I don’t lead to her. Am I ANGRY with myself
for going MAD? The CYCLE of authority and citation. I
want OFF.
