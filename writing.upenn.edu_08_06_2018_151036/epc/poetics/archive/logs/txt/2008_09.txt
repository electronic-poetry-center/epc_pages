Geraldine,

Are you sometimes scared to go back to novels you loved at one time?

It was such a disappointment to go back to Dostoevsky after twentyfive years
when I first read it when I was eighteen.

One Thousand Years of Solitude: ideally, this book should be read only once,
preferably before one has read any of its numerous imitators. Magical
Realism has become the favorite cliche of non-western writers presenting
their world to the west.

Dead Souls: I never dared go back to it. At one time it was my favorite
Russian novel, neck and neck with Tolstoy's incandescently precise prose.

Thank God I have no urge to go back to Ulysses.

I wonder if Jim Thompson's The Killer Inside Me and Pop. 1290 are as good as
I remember them to be; probably they are, infinitely superior to Dostoevsky.


On the other hand, there are novelist who remain as problematic, as fresh as
they were at first reading. Melville remains first among them, along with
Proust. They are hard to go back to (God how am I going to read Pierre
again!), but one can not help it.

Geraldine, I have a question. Is Jane Austen not the quintessential chick
lit writer. Girl rejects boy. Boy pursues girl. Girl gets boy, who is
handsome, rich (beyond imagination) and moral. In Mainsfield Park (that's
her last novel, yes?) the "poor" girl takes revenge on everyone who socially
put her by humiliating every one and gaining control. I know there is Jane
Austen's elegant, ironic, witty style; but how far does this style take one
over the years?

Ciao,

Murat

Flannery O' Conner said pretty much the same thing about teaching. She tried to discourage young writers. Those left were either real writers, fools, or both, as is often the case.

Wendell Berry did that whole farming thing. Thanks for the tip.

I actually think it's a really bad idea. If writing poetry is your job, you should be doing it seven hours a day, five days a week--and I hate to think of anyone writing that much poetry. I think poets should be more like farmers: Aren't they paid NOT to grow certain crops? That's the idea that appeals to me: Pay poets NOT to write poetry.

Incidentally, there is a very interesting book about these matters--the pros and cons of public subvention of the arts vs their being left to the whims of the market, etc.--by a Dutch economist who is also a painter, Hans Abbing. It's called Why Are Artists Poor? The Exceptional Economy of the Arts (University of Amsterdam Press). I don't agree with all his conclusions--he comes down more strongly in favor of the market than I think is justified--but he really understands the issues from both an artist's and an economist's viewpoint, a very rare thing.

I just returned from Copenhagen. When I asked poet Niels Hav what he "does for a living," he replied "write poetry." Assuming there was a language problem, I tried to clarify be asking him what he does to pay the bills. He told me the state pays him to write. Other poets (it was a dinner party) chimed in and acknowledged Hav: apparently some artists are provided living wages just to be artists. And though Niels' work probably falls under the "school of quietude" banner, it's still a fairly remarkable state of things..Of course, as they acknowledged, income tax is extremely high (by our standards) but as one poet said to me, "It's a trade off. We choose to [urchase security, choose to support arts and artists." He acknowledged that Denmark's relatively small size had to be taken in as a factor...

I'm busy, so I doubt if I'll check soon, but I'm almost positive that Merwin doesn't come from money. That makes his achievement all the more impressive. Major/minor, I make my list because I'm a list maker. But the Harold Bloom's of the world usually get the final say.

I still think Auster's wager was cute. He was merely moving away from poetry into prose narrative. I have no problem there. I simply don't buy the reasoning behind his wager. The wager seems dopey. I'd like to punch him but he's an old guy now so I won't. Maybe...
oh forget it.

Steve,

There is nothing cute about *Word To Mouth*. It has a significant place in
Auster's total work, as I tried to show in my last post

I think Merwin comes from a prominent family and is independently wealthy. I
agree with your distinction between poets who make a living out of their
poetry and those who do it from teaching.

I am not sure the distinction between minor and major is relevant here. Who
is to know? There are a many poets I personally know who do not teach, at
least not in a college or university: Joel Lewis, Basil King, Martha King,
Kimberly Lyons, Ron Silliman, David Chirot, Gary Sullivan, Nada Gordon,
Elinor Naueen, Maggie Dubris, Bob Hershon, Simon Pettet, Ed Friedman, Tony
Towle, Anne Tadros, Stacy Szymaszek, Anselm Berrigan. The list goes on and
on. On the other hand, it is informative to inquire if these poets' works
are different from the poets who teach at a university, *specifically* in a
Masters of Fine Department. For instance, Bruce Andrews teaches I think
philosophy, which is not the same thing.

Barry,

No I don't mean it in a negative way. I like reading it a lot, but I do feel
the critical praise of it is a bit top heavy.

Maybe, you are right. That is why I am hesistant to re-read novel which have
meant a lot to me. On the other hand, Melville, Proust , Tolstoy, Kleist, to
me, Hawthorne can be read in short pieces, as fragment. That way they are
more like poems.

Ciao,

Murat

I gave a few poetry work shops over the years. I would not permit them to
write poems in those work shops.

Those interested in this discussion should check our magazine Wig, which is devoted to poetry and art composed on the job and/or composed using workplace materials.

We are seeking submissions for our long over-due next issue. Please note that Wig is interested in poetry/art that employs the job—its time and materials—for artistic ends, not poetry/art “about” work, necessarily. Think Kora in Hell and Spring and All. Think Reznikoff’s Testimony, O’Hara’s Lunch Poems and Juliana Spahr’s Live and her most recent book The Transformation. (Note: we do not differentiate academic labor from non-academic labor.)

Our first (and so far only) issue includes work by: Kit Robinson, CA Conrad, Laura Elrick, Bill Howe, Kristen Gallagher (the co-editor of Wig), Chris Alexander, Marcus Bales, Anselm Berrigan, Mike Kelleher, and Chris Stroffolino.

You can purchase it for $5 by sending a check (made out to me) or cash to:

For us, the fact that poets can’t make a living off of their poetry is not only a given but a gift, of sorts. It is poetry’s strength that it exists beyond the logic of market forces, as a form of what Bataille calls “non-productive expenditure.” This, of course, does not mean that it cannot reproduce the logic of capitalism in its form. Only that, even when it does, it still exists in the realm of a hobby according to “the market.” Why do it? What’s the point? Think of all the productive ways you could be using your time.

In much of this discussion so far (save Barry's), there seems to be an unspoken assumption that poets ought to be able to make a living writing poetry. In my mind, the dilemma of livelihood that the poet faces leads directly to questioning the legitimacy of what Hannah Arendt in The Human Condition calls the “laboring society,” a society in which making a living trumps every other form of human activity. Poetry, in such a society, is not only a waste of time but a wasting of time—the kind that defines it as money, as “quality time.” This is poetry’s strength, insofar as it challenges, by the fact of its inexplicable existence, the given order. As Charles Bernstein has noted, poetry devalues the very paper it is written on, which means that it testifies to a different value form: that of the gift economy. Charles’s dictum can only be true if we buy into the logic of the market—the very thing we do when we argue that poets ought to be able to make a living from their poetry. Po
 ets sh
ould, like anyone, be able to make a living AND write their poetry (Arendt defines the former as ‘labor” and the latter as ‘work’), but because labor monopolizes time, squeezing all other forms of human activity into the realm of so-called “free time,” we are forced to either write on the run, as Williams so successfully did, or to become “starving artists,” the latter of which has become increasingly difficult to pull off in this age of flexploitation and institutionalized insecurity, as Pierre Bourdieu called it.  (Insofar as the academy adheres to the dictates of the laboring society, academic poets are also forced to write on the run, that is in the interstices—or what Kit Robinson calls—the slack time of the laboring day. Because the academic year is so crammed with busy-ness, the imperative of productivity haunts the summer months—too much loafing and you may find yourself out of a job.)

To devote one’s life to poetry is a Bartlebyian act of defiance, a refusal of the first order. It is, intrinsically, a rejection of the laboring imperative: that labor is what defines the human – labor being, as Arendt reminds us, the lowest form of human activity according to the Greeks (which is not to say that humans can’t draw from it a sense of fulfillment).

The question poetry brings to the table, then, is its implicit questioning of labor as our highest calling. It speaks for the need to put labor in its place, as a necessary human activity but only that: something we must perform in order to sustain ourselves, but not the primary activity of our lives. (We have long since had the tools to lift ourselves out of this primal condition.) So, to imply that poets ought to be able to make a living off their poetry is to approach the issue of livelihood from the wrong direction. Poetry, because it takes time to write, draws attention to labor’s monopolization of our time, and hence to the need to reduce the amount of time devoted to labor. Poets wouldn’t need to make a living off their poetry if the workweek was cut in half. In that sense, the poet’s dilemma is everyone’s. This is how poets, in my mind, connect with the larger public—not in their efforts to represent the public’s interest by becoming their voice—but through the action
  of wr
iting, which is a poaching of company time—all  time in the laboring society being company time. Our dilemma is common: we all need our time back. Our labor should create that surplus of time, not erase it.

Murat,
I can't really answer this because I haven't read any 'chick lit'  - I don't
read many novels now - I get a bit impatient with them.  But I dare say
Austen laid down the template for this kind of literature.  One of the
reasons I wouldn't now read Austen is because there are so many amazing bios
coming on the market of 17th &18th century women.  Writers like Mary
Robinson or Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle (with the annoying title Mad
Madge) and many who were not writers but managed to step outside their
social restraints and did some pretty 'scandalous' things.  Why read novels
when you can read about real people.

I don't think there are any rules about re-reading novels though - except
they might not be quite as good as you remembered.  Malcolm Lowry's Under
the Volcano can easily sustain more than one reading but I'd never read D.H.
Lawrence again - done him - enjoyed at the time but I think he might drive
me nuts if I read them now.

Geraldine

wasn't sentimental say in persuasion where the woman he chooses is the right

*********************************************************

POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT:

Executive Director for Small Press Traffic


Small Press Traffic announces a call for applications for the
position of Executive Director, to begin employment on
January 1, 2009.


Since 1974, Small Press Traffic has been at the heart of the San
Francisco Bay Area's innovative writing communities, bringing
together a diverse constituency of independent readers, writers,
and independent presses through our influential reading series,
poets theater festivals, conferences, and publications. Graciously
housed at the California College of the Arts, we remain autonomous,
and thus depend upon outside funding for our operating expenses.
Currently, we are looking for a highly skilled and creative Executive
Director to provide both artistic vision and financial leadership.


The Executive Director at Small Press Traffic serves as both
the Artistic and Financial Manager for the organization. S/he
ensures that (a) the overall quality and diversity of programming
is consistent with Small Press Traffic's history and mission and
(b) that the organization conducts its community and financial
affairs in a professional and timely manner. Areas of responsibility
include, but are not limited to: event programming, budget and
finance, fundraising, and public relations. Above all, the Executive
Director serves as the public face of the organization, and is
responsible for helping shape the vision and direction of Small
Press Traffic, as well as being open and responsive to our dynamic
and diverse communities of writers, readers, and audience members.


Programming: The Executive Director, in consultation with the
Board of Directors, oversees the planning and development of
Small Press Traffic's artistic program, which includes live literary
events, fundraisers, the website, archives, publications, and any
other forms of literary presentation and preservation.


Fundraising: The Executive Director initiates and coordinates
Small Press Traffic's fundraising efforts. These efforts include
submitting grant applications to government and private funding
agencies, meeting and corresponding with potential funders,
cultivating individual members and donors, planning and
hosting benefit events, assisting the Board of Directors with
its fundraising initiatives, submitting reports and payment
requests to individuals and agencies, and pursuing new fundraising
opportunities.


Public Relations: Small Press Traffic is a 34-year old
organization with a reputation for offering high-quality
programming that represents its commitment to a culturally
diverse avant-garde. It is important that Small Press Traffic
maintains good working relationships with writers, artists,
arts and literary organizations, funding and government
agencies, the press, and other groups and organizations
connected with the Bay Area arts and literary communities.
It is also crucial for the Executive Director to be able to
maintain a balance between her/his curatorial visions
and the desires of our audiences, and to be able to work
constructively with the Board and the wider Small Press
Traffic constituency to continue to uphold and extend our mission.


Budget and Finance: The Executive Director, in consultation
with the Board, plans and manages Small Press Traffic's
annual operating budget. S/he is responsible for ensuring
vendors are paid in a timely manner, that accurate financial
and fiduciary records are kept, and that actual expenses do
not exceed those proposed in the annual operating budget.
The Executive Director is also responsible for oversight of
interns and volunteers, as well as outside contractors
(such as designers, accountants, etc.).


Compensation: $27,000 annual salary. While the workload can vary widely,
depending on fundraising cycles and event schedules, the position typically
requires an average of twenty-five (25) hours per week. The position comes
with an initial 18-month contract, followed by one-year renewable
contract(s),
with annual evaluation process. Benefits are contingent on available
funding.


Position begins January 1, 2009. To apply, please send CV, cover letter,

Of course, it is a poet who is saying poems may be read endlessly and novels
not!!

When you join the Poet's Union, there's a clause in there you have to sign
in blood that says, no matter what, you will never let any other form of
writing be more favorably compared to poetry in one's presence or by
oneself, on the pain of immediate and ever lasting punishment under the
laws  & Codes of Poetic Justice--

Actually all my life I have had a small handful of books fiction poetry non
fiction that i pretty much read continuously--here and there one or two will
drop out and be replaced with new favorites--but i never get tired of
them--reading in fragments or chunks and interweaving them so that lines of
poems are found among descritpions of forged battle plans in an imaginary
writers story in a short story and a novel may be found to contain an
Anarkeyology of crumbling non fiction silting in with that frayed lines of
poems forming into a mimicking camouflaged appearing "terrain,." Always have
a couple of these talismanic tomes on my persons for those sudden
emergencies when one is swept up and finds oneself i the elsewheres of
hospitals police precincts wrong bus stop in the middle of nowhere,
abandoned houses in the middle of nights suddenly alive with ghosts or quite
simply at any given moment of the day when taken by surprise on is found
wandering again through those familiar words which seems to heave of a
sudden detoured into territory so strange that it is impossible to believe
yet there before one's very eyes that yes, on page 23, in the bottom right
part of the lat paragraph--is a passage that suddenly swings open and
reveals an entirely new world inside, like that wall in which there is a
door out of nowhere in the H. G. Wells story through which the passerby
discovers one can travel as through a portal among universes. Truly one
never remotely tires of these books and none of them have any ending at al
even though occasionally one decides to play at being a rational and orderly
processional person and does in deed "read straight through from beginning
to end,"--and each word is not the same as previously and its familiarity ,
the intimacy one has it with , is, like intimacy, the creation of a mystery
anew with in every instant of its intimicy with the intimacies of it
mysteries-intertwining-
I sometimes wonder if I am simply stuck like a raft in a whirlpool in a
river but no--since these tomes texts fragments volcanic actions and
explosions, are al continuously disintegrating and reforming, re arranging,
finding new meanings among the disordered alleys of their carelessly strewn
and tossed about left over various participles and hanging clauses and lines
that frankly made no sense--suddenly al of it gathering in a rush and one
finds oneself at the naissance of a cosmos completely unsuspected and which
is heaving and breathing with the convulsions of birth--
those Jim Thompson Murat i have read both of them abt twenty times and never
tired of them--truly the books poems and images sounds characters beings
histories become so much part of one they are always cropping up as one is
kneeling working in the dirt--parting some grass and smashed stones-there it
is! a line of a poem hobnobbing with a bunch of characters on the lam from a
a brilliant Sciascia book, warily playing cards with a bunch of cutthroats
from Rimbaud's illuminations and in the background is the west Texas sky of
the opening of The killer Inside Me--

now a character who moved into my works hangs out with these lot--bloody
discussions of the violence of words when used to conceal among their moral
suasions the true thick and heavy blood of the slaughterhouse that runs
under one's feet
or like when the man in the cell next to me was killed and he blood ran in
the little gutter for piss--
and blood flows in books not only words and death stalks in the pages as
they shudder in a breeze--and a wild set of heathen gods is roasting
something just over the hill as one realises that the marginalia in a text
have cannibalized the original--

and time to find another yet another copy! of the same volume--
because no matter how muh one reads it, the miracle is one never memorizes
it, and each time it really is a different series of words than the last

people go through life living with certain people in their lives long long
times-
and so it is with the great modern inventions of paperback pocket books that
fold and fall apart and are held together out of sheer willpower and who
cares if the pages begin to make new arrangements al their own with here and
there a few slipping away like thieves in the night while others come in,
hidden and darkly plotting among the over heaped baskets of apples or piles
of hot bricks, the heavy loads of aniomals furs--

Really, no book has an end, and when one is afraid of  book one is so
totally in love with and never wants it to end, slowing down and down and
down to put off as long as possible or maybe just not ever reach the end, so
one can start over again and not know ever really what the "ending is."

Because does the ending matter, Ivonne feels the ending will be the ending
of this intensity of intimacy of beings--then of course not-!

one might even just jerk out the last set of pages and stuff them in the
back of a police's man motorcycle car while he is writing a ticket for blind
deaf and dumb jay walker--

another good thing abt always having these companion with one is that one
has always paper with which to write!
and companions with whom to carry o conversations aloud or silently-
and what better honor than to write one's bizarre effusions among those
words one both knows and does not, the uncanny in full regalia before one
continually--

when i was on hose arrest ion Poland for two weeks at one point i had two
books actually with me in english to read--
notmysual ones which were stored in sweden-but byby a fluke ulysses by james
joyce and spoils of poynton by Henry James and Rimbaud quarter or so of book
that had fallen apart and ditto with a Raymond chandler flapping one
winged---as the back cover had long ago flown south on its own--

yet with those four directions as it were--the cosmos opens--
and one can read for sure Ulysses many times over in succession and it is
never the same

a good and esp great writer are never the same--and maybe it it is the
reader plays a part also of course-
but then there are so many books which if one essayed this--one wd feel as
though in manacles long before the arrest!!
or before the accident would feel a massive concussion
or simply as though--
endlessness is not a happy endlessness
but being doomed to an etrnerity of dullness, unimaginative and pompous and
narrow minded didactic "sophistory "aka soporifics--a new form of cocktail
philosophy, which Iike the Dial for N. Hawthorne, sends one immediately in
to the lands of Morpheus

remember jean Genet had very little to work with in his prison cells!!

it does not take al that many words with which one works continuously to
reform them over and over again like those pieces of bread roiled about in
the hands to soften and make them sticky in order to keep attached to the
metal flesh of a locker door--those flesh drenched black and white grainy
fotos of criminals that excite the writer--

the sexuality a writer/reader shares in the intimacy of being confined with
the texts and those texts that he is beginning to breed with this
companion--

why prisons have been veritable Schools of Writing with man quite
distinguished members attending off and on--and producing works far finer
than many of those fossilized forms that are carefully drawn to plan when
taught in the writing factories-

why not?
give Adolf Wolfi some pencils and watch him rip!!
Mr Milton Mr Cervantes mr Villon Chester Himes the fellow who wrote--Caryl
Chessman-one better not get started Borstal Boy and Malcolm X--twenty
million more
you se--Gregory Corso--people tottering abt in the Yard with book--
wearing it out and never getting to he end--

to be confined with a few books is to discover there is no end to them, if
they are good ones-

and maybe if they aren't quite good enough, after awhile, as one figures
it-- not really good enough,, why--then--to set to work to set that score
right!!

and  suddenly realize one is starting to find ways al one's own for making
up these forms and stories and to heck with being confined in some one
else's rule books--

and Villon le Bon Dieu le sait-

reading over and over for years on end the same few books in continual
oscillation -and so in what may at first appear a a confinement, a gerbil
running on the wheel to nowhere--
to find ever more possibilities and ideas imaginations structures forms
emerge--endlessly--

a negentropy of--emergence-

and so leave m roubaud and others to the entropy of the satisfaction of
determining that novels end here, and poems, of course, being those forms of
writings made by beings like unto oneself who like oneself have signed the
oath of loyalty to the secret of never endings--
produce programmaticly an endlessness

now--just because something is without end, does this mean that it is--may
one indeed guarantee this--if it is without end, is it then able to avoid
that yawning chasm--to be without loss of interest or energy or repeating
itself?--

ah indeed the dangers of the steady state universe of the never ending
endlessness!!

yes--one goes forward in endlessness and finds--???
well --
finds that novels at least have an end--

well the other one, locked away in the confines somewhere--
finds an inexhaustible flow of possibilities--
and thinks that sometimes, it is a good thing for a novel to have an end,
and maybe not so good for a poem not to have one!!

yes, al things need to be seen from many angles of the dangle do they
not--whistling gaily, --he addresses the fly with its thousand prismed eye-
and goes back to writing with the thinnest bit of black shoe polish on the
end of p]in inside the lines of one of his three endlessly read books--

and singing, having combined shoe polish and thus walking  inbetwen the
lines as he is writing--
yes--singing--
"I Walk the Line"--

A friend yesterday let me know that Armand Schwarner (sp?) - at least his name - appears in Bolano's Savage Detectives.
 This has some bearing on novelists reading poets, and vice versa. I will now definitely read the Bolano. He's earned my respect - or desire to read him -  with the mere mention of Armand.

 A real provincial when it comes to reading most novels, partly because I am a slow reader, and partly because I read them, when I do, for the poetry,(Proust, James, Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf, Collette, etc.)  and, I suspect most novelists don't write for the poetry, nor for that matter, read much poetry. And that's kind of irritating.    (The contradiction is that many of us will chew away on probably terrible translations of French and German philosophers, and such will throw our poetry into new directions).

 But any novelist who mentions Armand, he's OK by me!  (I also hear it's a wonderful book (novel).)

when i was on hose arrest ion Poland for two weeks at one point i had two
books actually with me in english to read--
notmysual ones which were stored in sweden-but byby a fluke ulysses by james
joyce and spoils of poynton by Henry James and Rimbaud quarter or so of book
that had fallen apart and ditto with a Raymond chandler flapping one
winged---as the back cover had long ago flown south on its own--

yet with those four directions as it were--the cosmos opens--
and one can read for sure Ulysses many times over in succession and it is
never the same

a good and esp great writer are never the same--and maybe it it is the
reader plays a part also of course-
but then there are so many books which if one essayed this--one wd feel as
though in manacles long before the arrest!!
or before the accident would feel a massive concussion
or simply as though--
endlessness is not a happy endlessness
but being doomed to an etrnerity of dullness, unimaginative and pompous and
narrow minded didactic "sophistory "aka soporifics--a new form of cocktail
philosophy, which Iike the Dial for N. Hawthorne, sends one immediately in
to the lands of Morpheus

remember jean Genet had very little to work with in his prison cells!!

it does not take al that many words with which one works continuously to
reform them over and over again like those pieces of bread roiled about in
the hands to soften and make them sticky in order to keep attached to the
metal flesh of a locker door--those flesh drenched black and white grainy
fotos of criminals that excite the writer--

the sexuality a writer/reader shares in the intimacy of being confined with
the texts and those texts that he is beginning to breed with this
companion--

why prisons have been veritable Schools of Writing with man quite
distinguished members attending off and on--and producing works far finer
than many of those fossilized forms that are carefully drawn to plan when
taught in the writing factories-

why not?
give Adolf Wolfi some pencils and watch him rip!!
Mr Milton Mr Cervantes mr Villon Chester Himes the fellow who wrote--Caryl
Chessman-one better not get started Borstal Boy and Malcolm X--twenty
million more
you se--Gregory Corso--people tottering abt in the Yard with book--
wearing it out and never getting to he end--

to be confined with a few books is to discover there is no end to them, if
they are good ones-

and maybe if they aren't quite good enough, after awhile, as one figures
it-- not really good enough,, why--then--to set to work to set that score
right!!

and  suddenly realize one is starting to find ways al one's own for making
up these forms and stories and to heck with being confined in some one
else's rule books--

and Villon le Bon Dieu le sait-

reading over and over for years on end the same few books in continual
oscillation -and so in what may at first appear a a confinement, a gerbil
running on the wheel to nowhere--
to find ever more possibilities and ideas imaginations structures forms
emerge--endlessly--

a negentropy of--emergence-

and so leave m roubaud and others to the entropy of the satisfaction of
determining that novels end here, and poems, of course, being those forms of
writings made by beings like unto oneself who like oneself have signed the
oath of loyalty to the secret of never endings--
produce programmaticly an endlessness

now--just because something is without end, does this mean that it is--may
one indeed guarantee this--if it is without end, is it then able to avoid
that yawning chasm--to be without loss of interest or energy or repeating
itself?--

ah indeed the dangers of the steady state universe of the never ending
endlessness!!

yes--one goes forward in endlessness and finds--???
well --
finds that novels at least have an end--

well the other one, locked away in the confines somewhere--
finds an inexhaustible flow of possibilities--
and thinks that sometimes, it is a good thing for a novel to have an end,
and maybe not so good for a poem not to have one!!

yes, al things need to be seen from many angles of the dangle do they
not--whistling gaily, --he addresses the fly with its thousand prismed eye-
and goes back to writing with the thinnest bit of black shoe polish on the
end of p]in inside the lines of one of his three endlessly read books--

and singing, having combined shoe polish and thus walking  inbetwen the
lines as he is writing--
yes--singing--
"I Walk the Line"--

Well, Geraldine (and hello, yes indeed)

Yes, Goode's view is, um, rather limited, and the book is not at all
London-centric if that means that's where the writers come from -- of =
the 84
or so sonneteers, almost half are from outside the UK (some of them
English/British born, yes, like yorkshire's Steve McCaffery), from
Australia, Canada, Eire, New Zealand, USAmerica, and it strikes me that
between them they offer a really energetic variety of work, from the =
more or
less conventional (i.e. fourteen lines) to the entirely visual. I posted =
/
re-posted Goode's blog-spasm because it might tell people here, more
vigorously that I can, first that this book actuially exists and second =
that
it really is worth a close look. If people on this list can't afford it,
they can ask their town library to get it, it's a lot cheaper than most
quality paperbacks that size.

It's Goode's enthusiasm (however limited its Lodnon-ish view might be) =
that
I wanted to share -- I'm enthusiastic about it too. I probably should've
written my own review instead (but where, can you tell me, can one make =
time
nowadays?) My own great pleasure in the book comes in part from the =
amazing
amount of news it carries -- but then I'm stuck on the left and wet =
coast of
a large subcontinent, in a somewhat provinical town which relies mostly =
on
imports for its reading/writing news. Mebbe it's different where Chris =
Goode
comes from, of course, but you're right, his rave is surprisingly =
selective
perhaps blind to imports.

I do think the Reality Street Book of Sonnets should get wide =
circulation;
it might open a lot of eyes (it opened mine, and I've been reading =
cxurerent
writing for four or five decades), and I'd expect it to change some =
people's
practice -- what somebody on this list, talking of was it Hawthorne?
Melville? called his writer's DNA.

Good morning.  I am very interested in using visual poetry in my =20
undergrad and grad poetry classes at the University of South =20
Alabama.  I would love to see your syllabi.  Last year, in =20
collaboration with the art department, we put on a most successful =20
show in which the art students illustrated poems written by my =20
students. 250 people attended -- but this is "old hat," and I'm =20
looking for new ways of incorporation.

I am also interested in sound -- so thanks for your help with vispo.

I live on Harriet Avenue in Minneapolis, where one of the Friday raids
occurred.  In fact, I was sitting at a coffee shop two blocks away last
night when we saw a Sherriff's Paddy Wagon, a tv van and no fewer than 10
police cars around the neighborhood, six within a few minutes of the paddy
wagon coming through and a bunch of others just "patrolling" the
neighborhood.



**********************



I live in a lefty neighborhood.  We have a co-op and Arise, the anarchist
bookstore.  The City has used people's fear of crime to talk the
neighborhood organizations into accepting city money for more police patrols
this summer and they have been THICK here around my few blocks-bikes,
squads, etc.-all the time.



**********************



I have been telling everyone who can stand to listen to me about the fact
that Minneapolis has been gradually becoming more and more of a police state
over the past two years.  Last summer, TWO police officers-local and
sheriff-on every single corner downtown day and night, sometimes standing,
on bikes or in squad cars parked on the sidewalks.  I am not exaggerating.
This summer, FOUR.  Mostly they bust petty crimes rather than violent ones.
And mostly in my neighborhood they harass anyone who looks "suspicious"
which covers most people in my neighborhood.



**********************



I went to court on Monday for a friend who got busted on some petty charges
and the public defenders were complaining about their huge caseload and
saying "well, it's the week before the convention."  It's been my experience
watching concerts festivals and other events here that not only will they be
raiding political offices like this, but they will also definitely be
sweeping the streets for the homeless and other people who might scare off
the conventioneers, who are housed in both downtown Minneapolis and in St.
Paul.

I was marching yesterday in St. Paul. I could not believe the number of pol=
ice--15-20 darth vader looking characters at each side of the intersections=
--and at numerous intersections, plus police on bikes and wearing shorts. I=
 can't help but believe that many of the arrests were unnecessary--Amy Good=
man, among many others, I am sure. Despite the heat, I am so glad that I wa=
s there--solidarity among us; that was great. Perhaps we were too peaceful-=
-the 10,000 or so of us, and we should have raised more hell.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Stanford Fans & Small Press Publishers,

While we have been able to organize & promote three days of events in Fayetteville, Arkansas celebrating Frank Stanford's work with minimal costs, we'd like to honor a few central figures in Stanford's creative career by supporting their travel to participate in the festival.

Sponsors will be acknowledge in promotional materials and in a commemorative, hand-sewn  program designed by Cannibal Books.  Sponsors will also receive a broadside of a poem from Stanford's final book, You, designed and printed collaboratively between Lost Roads Publishers, Cannibal Books and Effing Press.  We will also verbally recognize sponsors at all events, which include a Small Press Reading, several Stanford readings, two panels, a screening or Irving Broughton's legendary Stanford biopic It Wasn't a Dream It Was a Flood, and a marathon reading of Stanford's epic poem The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You.

Donations are tax deductible and payable to Lost Roads. For more information, query Matthew Henriksen at frankstanfordfest@gmail.com.

my name appears in a francine prose early novel
well my last name at least not because of potry but because tho we have
no relationship
she wrote a book about russian folk and remembered my last name from our
school days
so sometimes the character's name has no connection to the "real" person

only recently been able to take a look at Sillman's epic, something Huts. with the Chinese notebook section, the poems that look like "normal" poems 2. The guy's a monster. the opening section is maybe something entirely new. Pure writing. Prose? Joyce? what is it? i've seen stuff like it before but nothing as elaborate.

from the lango poets i'm trying to get to the point where i can write confidently in an abstract way. i can do it on paintshop. i should be able to get there with the word.

what else? anything more to say? something? what?

IndyMedia has a good update page & Glenn Greenwald has been updating as well.

http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/

I try not to be paranoid but the fact is that police departments all
over the US have a crapload of Department of Homeland Security money &
have bought all kinds of crazy gear & have become militarized even
beyond what the War on Drugs $$$  provided them.

In the future, as citizens give more power to the federal government,
I think the incentive to protest will be even lessened. If the federal
gov't is underwriting your healthcare, for example, are you going to
risk protesting?

Here's the Fall Schedule for A-New Poetry: Experimental Writing Series in Eugene, OR

Robert Grenier
Wednesday, September 10, 7:30 PM
@ DIVA, 110 W. Broadway, Eugene, OR

Robert Grenier is a contemporary American poet associated with the Bay Area Language Poetry scene of the mid-70s to mid-80s. A graduate of Harvard College and the University of Iowa Program in Creative Writing, he has taught literature and creative writing at UC Berkeley, Tufts, Franconia College, New College of California and Mills College. His works include Sentences, Series, Oakland, A Day At The Beach, Phantom Anthems and OWL/ON/BOU/GH . Grenier is currently co-editing a Collected Poems of Larry Eigner for the Stanford University Press. He was founding co-editor (with Barrett Watten) of the influential little magazine This (1971-1974) and was the editor of Robert Creeley's Selected Poems, published in 1976. Grenier's early work, influenced by Creeley, is noted for its minimalism. Grenier's recent work is as much visual as verbal, involving multicolor "drawn" poems in special (and not always reproducible) formats.

rein in aggressive and violent tactics by local law enforcement, stop the
targeting of journalists and immediately drop all charges against them.

It seems like, earlier in the day, the astonishing mob of police in riot gear have usually been pretty calm. It's as the afternoon goes on that they start splitting peaceful marches arbitrarily into smaller sections, detaining large groups of people for hours on single city blocks, raiding various spaces. Last night there were three attempted police actions at the Bedlam Theatre, where I'm performing every night--the first a response to an anonymous call asserting that the Bedlam was selling "more than beer and wine." Fortunately, the folks there run a very tight ship, ID'ing people rigorously, etc., so the officer who showed up was shown around the building to her satisfaction. When told that the theater was hosting evenings of political art in response to the RNC, she said "I'll try to come back for that. I'd be protesting if I didn't have this job." Later in the evening, a fleet of bicycle cops showed up, and an hour later seven or eight squad cars;
 neither found anything illegal going on, so they left. The sort of luck not found by the people at the RNC Welcoming Committee Convergence Center, who had their dangerous pamphlets and unspecified "weapons" confiscated.

The anarchists, by the way, tend to get a bad rap. For every report of a flaming dumpster or a rock through a window, assume 200 more incredibly well-organized people, presenting a type of chaotic performance much less thrill-driven and violent than their popular image--one which can switch modes and directions at an instant, revealing the tight links between its members. They also have the general policy of conducting controversial actions in a way "separated by time or space" from permitted activities, so that they're not conflated with the officially sanctioned protest events. The papers here--so far--have picked up on that distinction pretty well, which is surprising; I'm used to journalists taking every opportunity to make property destruction the symbolic image of any activist event.

Mary, Fluffy--come see the goings-on at the Bedlam! Great political theater and music nightly.

WOW! What a marvelous gathering! I sure wish I would have known a
couple of months ago. Now I have a conflict, but I'm definitely there
in spirit, and hopefully can listen to recorded versions if they will
be available somewhere.

Hey!

I'm currently working on a project called "Ore" (the third part in a trilog=
y of books - the first two called "the Proteus" and "Joys : A Catalogue of =
Disappointments"). Now, Ore is peculiar in that it does not contain any of =
my words or lines or poems - I'm simply reading all the books I can get my =
hands on and (consciously) building a collage of texts. Some are built of l=
ines from one particular book (ROVA Improvisations, Coolidge, for instance)=
; some are patchworks from multiple books and journal and on-line sources. =
Here's the example from ROVA:

we breathe, the gap we breathe
you have to eye into these speeds
make a cue of silence thumbs
a bus or canoe, frog boots, lump in your station
of notion, the full time riddle
take back the once said to the one in need

but what accumulates like silence (like silences)
where is my hand
the deignings to be patched out over a selection of tones / bones

but seeing is always in tune
not exactly a belief in hearing
as the distance from there (hedgerows) to here (ovaltine)
saying what is written with is without a light
that no lights truly match
but that =93just=94 is wrong
gets breath, breath of holds that fill with stuff
and in the interstitial oink (oak) the oleo (trace)
how fast, how slim in the palm?
that in some voice you will say it

that no one solos
a blenter awe-quid sod
bent and sun-veined wheel

put things in with pins in the semblance
gone as far as caps will take us (it)

brands, at the back came back
sounds as like sounds
white side of a house, laugh
primes, motes
sureness of the bend

What I'm asking here is... am I going to run into problems if I'm building =
a complete book from other people's poems (OPP) and lines? I know this soun=
ds a bit risky but... if you have any advice for me, so as to avoid infring=
ement or nagging, please send me a message at cacasama@towson.edu

Thanks!

It seems like, earlier in the day, the astonishing mob of police in riot ge=
ar
have usually been pretty calm. It's as the afternoon goes on that they star=
t
splitting peaceful marches arbitrarily into smaller sections, detaining lar=
ge
groups of people for hours on single city blocks, raiding various spaces. L=
ast
night there were three attempted police actions at the Bedlam Theatre, wher=
e
I'm performing every night--the first a response to an anonymous call
asserting that the Bedlam was selling "more than beer and wine."
Fortunately, the folks there run a very tight ship, ID'ing people
rigorously, etc., so the officer who showed up was shown around the buildin=
g to
her satisfaction. When told that the theater was hosting evenings of politi=
cal
art in response to the RNC, she said "I'll try to come back for that.
I'd be protesting if I didn't have this job." Later in the evening,
a fleet of bicycle cops showed up, and an hour later seven or eight squad c=
ars;
 neither found anything illegal going on, so they left. The sort of luck no=
t
found by the people at the RNC Welcoming Committee Convergence Center, who =
had
their dangerous pamphlets and unspecified "weapons" confiscated.=20

The anarchists, by the way, tend to get a bad rap. For every report of a
flaming dumpster or a rock through a window, assume 200 more incredibly
well-organized people, presenting a type of chaotic performance much less
thrill-driven and violent than their popular image--one which can switch mo=
des
and directions at an instant, revealing the tight links between its members=
.
They also have the general policy of conducting controversial actions in a =
way
"separated by time or space" from permitted activities, so that
they're not conflated with the officially sanctioned protest events. The
papers here--so far--have picked up on that distinction pretty well, which =
is
surprising; I'm used to journalists taking every opportunity to make
property destruction the symbolic image of any activist event.=20

Mary, Fluffy--come see the goings-on at the Bedlam! Great political theater=
 and
music nightly.=20

Wait a second.  Re:  Jilly Dybka's "In the future, as citizens give more =

So there's no protest in France?  Canada?  I disagree with the term "unde=

 as I see it, the=20

What an incredible gathering!

(I cannot post on New Poetry, my other email has a strange glitch, a mail i=

the Outbox does not leave and I cannot send out messages. If there is any
good person who knows what I can do to take it out, it does not respond to

First Question:  did you just quote Coolidge, or your poem?

& some brief, quick responses to the idea of "infringement"

as if poetry isn't already composed as an infringement
on all kinds and species of norms, proprieties and complacencies,
your work is collage, the "originality" found in processes of relation
from line to line
most readers, I would bet, won't know your sourcing
enough to be provoked

three works of my own have used, almost entirely,
lines or poems from other works:
a poem in Ecopoetics 4/5 "The Natural World",
the entirety of "A Book of Birthdays"
(composed by using lines from books
published in the birth-year of the friend or relation
to whom the poem was dedicated)
and a re-writing of Rabindranath Tagore's *Gitanjali

*there are hundreds of examples of this from fine writers & artists
such as Schwitters, Ernst,
the master of uncreative writing Kenneth Goldsmith
or the project of Flarf:
the idea is "collage"
which was discussed in this forum recently (see the Poetics List archives)

judgement is less likely to fall on your appropriation
than on the quality and durability of the weave

but my work on Tagore's poems leaves me with my own questions,
is it a modernization? or an interpretation?
certainly not ironic tribute as in Geoff Ward's "Duino Elegies"
so these Gitanjali I call "Mutilations and Addled Beauty"
based on Tagore's statements in his _Selected Letters_
about Robert Bridges rewriting one of his poems.

Flarf poets are very articulate about their projects &
they may help by raising the needed questions
about the meaning of poetry in general,
and the values of appropriation, distances and distancing
(temporal/social)
from source to destination

I think it depends on why you are using these texts
and what you want your text to demonstrate

my Tagore rationale is flowery & idiosyncratic:
"his genius gives us a song that, once begun, cannot but find
instruments in the world to continue it"
& I don't feel compelled to publish my versions,
I want simply to "take a share" in them
or send them to Tagore fans by mail.

Send yours to Coolidge.
To cop from OPP may be a good way to fail beautifully.

& free speech seems to be an infringement, too
as I read about/see & am appalled by the behaviors
of the police & corporate media at the RNC.

best,
dm

Subject:      Poets for Palestine--an International Anthology of Poetry,
              Spoken Word, Hip-Hop & Art available
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Release, *Poets for Palestine,* 3 September 2008


 Sixty years after the dispossession of the Palestinian people, *Poets For
Palestine*, a unique collection of poetry, spoken word, hip-hop, and art has
been released. Unifying a diverse range of poets who have used their words
to elevate the consciousness of humanity, this book aims to bridge a younger
generation of poets with those who, for decades, have cultivated and
strengthened the poetic medium.

The anthology includes poems by the late Mahmoud Darwish, Naomi Shihab Nye,
Amiri Baraka, Suheir Hammad, Nathalie Handal, E. Ethelbert Miller, D.H.
Melhem, Junichi P. Semitsu, Fawzia Afzal Khan, Annemarie Jacir, Ibtisam
Barakat, Tahani Salah, Remi Kanazi, Ragtop from the Philistines, among many
others.

All of the proceeds of this volume will go towards funding future cultural
endeavors in the US that highlight Arab artistry.

The concept of this collection was conceived after a night of spoken word at
the historic *Made in Palestine* art exhibit in New York, in 2006.
Invigorated by the capacity of spoken word to enliven a crowd, Al Jisser,
collaborating with the event's host, Remi Kanazi, decided to publish a brief
chapbook to capture the night's vivacity.

Venturing further into the project, Al Jisser chose to send out a call for
poetry that reached a multitude of countries, receiving submissions from the
Occupied Palestinian Territories, the broader Arab world, Europe, Australia
and the United States. They chose not to limit the subject solely to the
topic of Palestine, instead widening the scope to issues as varied as the
ongoing occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan as well as poetry on Sudan and
Lebanon. The aim is to convey that the basic appeal of justice is a
fundamentally, irreducibly human appeal.

At a time when conditions for Palestinians have become increasingly
devastating, *Poets For Palestine* seeks to give humanity its proper voice
and attempts to further demonstrate the role art takes in transmitting and
projecting the enormous weight of compassion.

Poets For Palestine *is available on
www.PoetsForPalestine.com<http://www.poetsforpalestine.com/>.
The book will soon be featured in independent and progressive bookstores
throughout the US as well as on Amazon.com.*

As someone who has checked with a lawyer about some aspects of my own poetr=
y, I heartily agree with Barry Schwabsky that Christophe should consult wit=
h a lawyer, not rely on non-professional advice. Furthermore, I think he sh=
ould consult with not just any lawyer, but with a lawyer specializing in ei=
ther intellectual property or arts/entertainment.  I think such a lawyer co=
uld tell Christophe about the evolving legal opinions regarding "appropriat=
ive" art.=0A=0AAs a poet who writes poems inspired by works of art from aro=
und the world, I checked with a lawyer to be sure that I wasn't infringing =

John Rininger

from the introduction by Stephen Perkins

"John Rininger, mail & stamp artist, magazine publisher, and networker
died unexpectedly at 45 from a seizure in his apartment in Chicago on
November 11th, 2006. The works in this posthumous issue of Xerolage
have been taken from a number of different sources, and they can only
offer a faint trace of his work, his concerns, and the many passions
that animated his idiosyncratic personality. I can't say I ever
understood John, he was a complex man, and yet one sensed a sharp
intelligence, an intense curiosity about the world, and I responded to
that, and I'm richer for knowing him."

Other than a dog with lipstick (not my description) what exactly is a
'hockey mom'?  As if she's not scary enough without belting out this refrain
as  though it's encoded slang for psycho- killer. Is this what's she's
trying to say? Am I close?  Are there more of these lippy 'hockey moms' on
the loose trying to take over the world?

fretfully yours,

Geraldine

Hi Everyone,

Summer will not end and our poetry season will not officially begin until

Toma=C5=BE =C5=A0alamun will appear in the parish hall. Until then, consider signin=
g
up for one of our workshops described below. Also, scroll down for
information from our Howl Festival friends.

"There is then creative reading as well as creative writing,=E2=80=9D wrote Emers=
on;
and between the two, where reading and writing converge, exists spontaneous
combustion. In our writing laboratory, workshop participants will experimen=
t
in this potent, limnal gap. Through concentrated readings of one author of
their choosing, participants will write a series of poems (poetry defined i=
n
the most expansive manner) that converse, confront, conform, channel, chant=
,
and concuss the poet and poetry of choice. Poems written in this workshop
will employ extensive methodologies that will originate from a brainstormin=
g
session intended to cultivate startling structures and processes. Martine
Bellen is the author of Tales of Murasaki and Other Poems (Sun & Moon Press=
)
and The Vulnerability of Order (Copper Canyon Press) among other
collections.

Writing Chance: A Random Workshop on Process =E2=80=93 Tisa Bryant
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 10th

If we are, writer Amina Cain suggests, mysterious seducers of experience,
mapping our knowing of people and places into a rhizome of dark knots and
clear threads, how do we allow for such human magic as we write through
structures, constraints, intentions, politics and deadlines?  How can we
know the difference between force and feeling, or simply when to let the
work go?  In this workshop, we=E2=80=99ll weigh our needs and intentions against =
the
power of chance, to better observe and embrace our creative process.  We=E2=80=99=
ll
work and share inclusive of and across genres, graze the works of Hannah
Weiner, Samuel Beckett, Russell Atkins, Maya Deren, Jackson Pollock, Kirthi
Nath, the Situationists, Fred Wilson, Miranda Mellis, and whomever you may
bring.  Consider coincidence as social encounter, with the desire to know a=
s
a means of triggering, from person and page, synchronic new modes of rigor
and flow.  Tisa Bryant is the author of Unexplained Presence, from Leon
Works, and a founding editor-publisher of The Encyclopedia Project.

(Soma)tic Poetry =E2=80=93 caconrad
SaturDAYS AT noon: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN october 11th

In this frantic, routine-driven world we need freedom from regimented poetr=
y
writing, and a healthy dose of walking the space between Soma (spirit) and
Somatic (body).  Using gemstones, trees, and the city itself, we will creat=
e
deliberate, sustained physical manipulations to generate language to write
our poems.  Every thing is new every time we embark, and opening our minds
to having that freedom in our lives everyday to write poems is what these
workshops are about. Poetry is for everyBody, therefore everyBody is
welcome! CAConrad's book (Soma)tic Midge (FAUX Press) was written after
eating and living with a single color for a day. Poem samples, as well as a
link to his monthly (Soma)tic Poetry Exercises can be found here:

MAKE NEW MISTAKES: A WRITING WORKSHOP FOR TEENS =E2=80=93 Chris Martin
THURSDAYS 4:30-6PM: 5 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 23rd
=20
While losing may be an art that=E2=80=99s easily mastered, mistaking requires som=
e
experimental spirit. In this workshop, instead of just making it new, we
will explore the art of making new mistakes through reading, seeing,
hearing, rapping, and most of all writing.  Along the way we will encounter
the Ecstatic Truth of Werner Herzog, How to Be Perfect by Ron Padgett, the
chromo-poems of CA Conrad, Gertrude Stein=E2=80=99s Tender Buttons, dispatches fr=
om
the Spasmodic School, the MCs of Avant-Rap, and much else.  Best of all, we
will make many new mistakes together, through in-class collaborations,
critiques, and performances.  Young writers of any style, persuasion,
interest, ability, and borough are all equally welcome.  Let=E2=80=99s stop
pretending to be perfect and start writing poems that are alive and
writhing. Chris Martin is the author of American Music and has taught young
New Yorkers for the past six years.  Open to high school teens. FREE.


The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one year Sustaining Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all spring and fall classes.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be
received in advance. Caps on class sizes, if in effect, will be determined

Good god=2C since when do lawyers take precedence over poets?
=20
Why would anyone relegate their creative potential - even when involving ap=
propriation - to a staus secondary to some more "legal" one that revolves a=
round curtailment of ANY kind of "use"?
=20
Admittedly=2C poets=2C once regarded as "scribes"=2C were those whose writ =
derived its authority from royalty=2C which itself had a deep connection wi=
th an attending priesthood.
=20
This is what Plato brought forward by dismissing oral poetries from univers=
ity curriculum: it was too easy for the verbal virtuosi to "make things up.=
"  So that creative work became rather like Philosophy (and/or Science) whi=
ch had a thoroughtly empirical base.
=20
So.  The question remains=2C do we really=2C as creative persons=2C want to=
 be told what our legal "share" of the works of others most actually is=2C =
keeping in mind=2C too=2C the lengthy tradition of the transmission of know=
ledge (oral and written=2C both)=2C that "happiness is saying what others h=
ave said"?
=20
Ie.=2C who ARE these people=2C what have they said=2C and in what way(s) mi=
ght we take place within the overall perception of Other=2C in similitude=
=2C and (l)imitation?
=20
"Individual" work might involve the same kind of delusion that Individualis=
m itself seems to have=2C that Everything is somehow "waiting for YOU."  Yo=
u?  Me?  Are these the persons we're supposed to have respect for?  Appropr=
iation=2C most probably=2C is the only KIND of respect.  The Village Idiot =
- the one who invariably knows - is that one who endlessly repeats everythi=
ng that everyone ELSE is saying.
=20
Thank god.  Who was it said=2C you want to be an Individual?  Learn how to =
write your name.  I agree.  Everything beyond that is an Open Tulip.

3rd floor amphitheater

An Iraqi poet interviewed recently on NPR said that for him and his
contemporaries the purpose of writing poetry is =B3to keep the language
from going insane.=B2 What now might sanity look or sound like =8B in poems, in
visual art, in other forms of social conduct? What does it mean to be a
=B3professional=B2 in this respect? Who=B9s reading, looking, and who really
cares? This talk will range among such matters and more, with,
hopefully, much room for actual conversation, present company included.

*****************************************************************

Small Press Traffic is proud to kick off its Fall 2008 season in grand styl=
e
with the production of:


Geyser!

a new play by

Kevin Killian and Wayne Smith


Friday, September 12th, 7:30 p.m.
Timken Lecture Hall
Please arrive early; all seats $10 as a benefit for Small Press Traffic
Please join us for refreshments prior to the event

Kevin Killian's plays are annual favorites here at SPT--
Geyser! is an experience you won't want to miss!


Geyser, Oregon, a charming woodlands town, was once the setting
for a television series that attempted to combine elements of family
drama and science education. The show was in its second season
in 1978 when a tragedy on set caused it to shut down midseason,
and now that it's been released on DVD, Geyser! has found a new
mass audience to match the tiny cult audience it's known since its
untimely cancellation=97and they're all flocking to Oregon this summer,
as the brave little town welcomes back members of the original cast
to entertain the worldwide fan club at a Geyser festival.  But the town
has secrets of its own!  Mayor Constance Strode, struggling with her
own family drama, tries to pump up tourism while fending off the
attentions of Bobo, leader of a radical clown collective on the outskirts
of town. Screen actor Dennis Quaid, who first sprang to national
attention as the young hero of Geyser! returns to the scene of the
crime with the bewildering knowledge that all of his recent co-stars,
from Reese Witherspoon to Ellen Barkin, have all been swept out to
sea. Rival TV talk show hosts Rick Penny and Kitty Potter wring
every scrap of drama and nostalgia to the airwaves, while Marjorie
Cantrell, the first lady of the American theater and the nominal star
of the lamented TV show, Geyser!, emerges from a 30 year retirement
in grand Sunset Boulevard fashion with her loyal butler, Crimmins. As
excited fans gather from round the world, the waters coursing through
the deep underground caverns beneath them gurgle, groan and spew.
It's all in a town--and a show--called Geyser!


Wayne Smith is a visual and sound artist who lives and works in
San Francisco. Working in a variety of media including drawing,
installation and video, his work has been shown locally and nationally.
He collaborated with Berlin-based artist D-L Alvarez on a sound
and video installation loosely based on Joan Didion's The White
Album that took place at the Derek Eller Gallery, NY in April 2007.
Recording as Aero Mic'd, he has released four CDS, the latest
being "I Think You're Great," In August 2008, joined by Cliff Hengst
and Scott Hewicker, Aero Mic'd will perform at the Schindler House
in Los Angeles as part of the "sound." series, which is organized by
SASSAS (The Society for the Activation of Social Space through
Art and Sound).


Kevin Killian is a poet, novelist, critic and playwright whose recent
work includes "Kiki: The Proof Is in the Pudding," a retrospective
exhibition at Ratio 3, a book of reviews Selected Amazon Reviews
(2006), a collection of poetry, Argento Series (2001), two novels,
Shy (1989) and Arctic Summer (1997), a book of memoirs, Bedrooms
Have Windows (1989), and two books of stories, Little Men (1996)
and I Cry Like a Baby (2001). He has also edited a collection of
short stories by the late Sam D'Allesandro, The Wild Creatures (2005).
For the San Francisco Poets Theater Killian has written over thirty
plays, including Stone Marmalade (1996, with Leslie Scalapino)
and Often (2001, with Barbara Guest).   Geyser! is sure to be an
evening to remember!

Therese:

Speaking very generally (and in no way providing legal advice), one of th=
e
exclusive rights given to an author as part of copyright is the right to
perform her copyrighted work "publicly". So the short answer to your
question is: no, simply reading aloud is not infringement. Now if you are=

proposing a hypothetical where you are reading aloud to an audience
somewhere outside your home, then you are likely publicly performing the
work (just as you would if you were to take up your violin or piano and p=
lay
a Steve Reich composition, or stage a Richard Foreman play, or show Star
Wars). I believe there is a limited exception for public performance in a=
n
education environment.=20

All that said, I think that in most cases you would be hard pressed to fi=
nd
(a) a poet who wasn't overjoyed that someone else was "covering" her poem=
,
(b) an attorney or government agent willing to waste her time prosecuting=

the relatively trivial infringement (I'm assuming that your reading aloud=
 of
someone else's work hasn't made you a millionaire (if it has, please send=

details)).

Hope that helps somewhat,
James Sanders

Hockey moms (or dads) are like their soccer or Little League equivalents: sociopathic parents who will attack coaches, other parents, and even their kids' teammates (or members of the opposing team) when they feel their child has been called on a foul, or any perception they have been treated unfairly. Symptoms are similar to road rage. When I lived on Staten Island, a number of parents were arrested following assaults, and even some seriously injurious behavior.

Hello Geraldine

I had to ask an American friend the same question. He replied that a
friend of his had commented that 'all you need to be a "hockey mom" is
a mini-van. Or any vehicle.'

I'm still fretting, though.

geraldine,

i think it's mostly meant as a regional variant of "soccer mom"
(hockey more popular in northern states than soccer?), which itself is
a class and demographic marker...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer_mom

tho hockey fans are also perhaps more vociferous and bloodthirsty
(than american soccer fans at least).

warily,
tom

Other than a dog with lipstick (not my description) what exactly is a
'hockey mom'?  As if she's not scary enough without belting out this refrain
as  though it's encoded slang for psycho- killer. Is this what's she's
trying to say? Am I close?  Are there more of these lippy 'hockey moms' on
the loose trying to take over the world?

fretfully yours,

Geraldine

from the wikipedia page Tom posted

"Soccer Moms," a poem by Paul
Muldoon<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Muldoon>,
was originally published in *The New Yorker* and appears in *Horse Latitudes
* (2006).

So I think maybe this poem could be revised into Hockey Mom and changed into
a palinode somehow...

'Good god, since when do lawyers take precedence over poets?'

I agree Stephen.  What's it to do with them - they'll just take you to the
cleaners and laugh all the way to the bank.  As Proudhon almost said:
'Poetry is theft'.

hockey, in north america, is largely a canadian game. popular in the
northern states, particularly alaska, because of alaska's climate and
relative proximity to canada vs the usa.

hockey moms are mainly moms. moms who devotedly drive their kid(s) to hockey
games and practices at all hours. like ms palin will drive the kids to war,
if elected. mom and apple pie as mom and t-bone steak.

hockey has now apparently entered the usamerican political lexicon. as
crypto for war. yet canadians like to think of canada's role as
peacekeeping. i think we have at least 5 peacekeepers now. the rest of the
military is deployed in afghanistan helping afghan women become hockey moms.

I think of Cezanne in relation with reading/writing and how these live with=
 one through time.  Cezanne's favorite distinguishing characteristic for ar=
tists whom he regarded as actual artists=2C "the real thing=2C" was what he=
 pronounced in his Aixois accent as "temprrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrement=3B" hi=
s friends noting he rolled the "r" to an extremely exaggerated duration eve=
n for a Southerner. Cezanne's "temprrrrrement" in action was to return to t=
he same scene and work on it over and over and over again.  He writes of si=
tting on a river bank and realizing that for months he could work with just=
 one view before him=2C for to move the head even an inch is to introduce s=
uch a multitude of new views. =20
According to one's "temperament" and what it is one is working with through=
 time=2C there are writers to whom=2C like these "scenes in Nature" of Ceza=
nne's--one is continually returning as they offer ever deeper analyses of t=
he questions and findings with which one works.  Through time=2C there is a=
  paring down=2C and also the finding of new examples that give one the sam=
e endless field for study.  The elements which are in a sense the "simplest=
" and at the same time "the most deeply" and rhizomatically extensive in co=
nnection with actual existence through time in relation with language itsel=
f as an existence moving in time=2C make of some works not things separate =
from one=2C but integrally a part of one's existence in al phases of consci=
ousness--thought=2C dream=2C memory=2C reverie=2C imagination.=20

Walking in the world is walking with these works and the ones one finds in =
carrying on this endless conversation.  The works no longer exist within th=
e pages of books at all=2C but are everywhere found=2C like colors for a pa=
inter=2C sounds for s musician=2C al this material=2C all around one--as Ch=
arlie Parker gestured to the person who thought he was existing nowhere amo=
ngst nothing--all these works exist and are tools and ways of seeing=2C hea=
ring=2C touching=2C smelling=2C voicing that go with one everywhere.  This =
is why I write often of Robert Smithson's "Art of Looking" and "making art =
with a glance"--a work--as real as any existing as an object=2C but unlike =
the object or book=2C one which is not a product=2C has no "value=2C" and e=
xists only as it occurs in time.  From very long ago more than one count=2C=
 humans have :"read" the skies=2C the landscapes=2Cthe oceans=2C the change=
s in animals' movements or sounds. There are some writers or lines or fragm=
ents=2C poems that take on this quality of a writing present in al things w=
hich one returns to continually and works with continually.=20

Each time one returns and reads those "same" words again for the hundredth =
time=2C they are not the same.
On may think=2C "ah=2C see how much I have changed and put distance between=
 myself and this--!"

Yet living with them long whiles continualy outside of books=2C to see them=
 in there is always a surprise=2C and they =2C like oneself=2C they have ch=
anged through time. A "shock of recgontion=2C" as though "meeting for the f=
irst time all over again."

Poems=2C stories=2C al these things in words have lives of their own=2C ong=
oing=2C cropping up suddenly in the form of a flower or weed  in the heat o=
f an afternoon or bedazzling one from a mud puddle as an oil slick floating=
 among clouds=2C a kind of "reversed rainbow" radiating in a pot holed alle=
y.

"And so we meet again--" out here in the chatoic teeming worlds=2C every bi=
t as mong the pages returned to=2C where now the oil slick has drenched the=
 pages with an unexpected deposit of sult and the deltas of shifting phrase=
s echo still with the ones of times past.

Thanks for the link Tom and to everyone else.  I've got the idea and Marc's
post in particular confirms my worst fears. She really does worry me now. I
think Ms Palin is capable of  making an aggressive apple pie.

Slam dunk!
(err - no don't bother - I don't care what that means - it's too Anglo Saxon
to take seriously!).

no, but there's a tie in with the 'hockey mom' thread. coinciding with
palin's rise, an ahl pro hockey team is going to start up in alaska. a new
arena is going to be built for it. they're calling it the palin dome.

... and when it comes to pit bull terriers, uz in the UK, despite our
reputation for political correctness, like handguns, simply decided to ban
the buggers.

Somehow, when push came to shove, the argument that pit bull terriers were
Deeply Misunderstood didn't carry that much weight -- after the third
child-death at the teeth of a pit bull terrier, enough was enough.

So we're in favour of polar bears and wolves, but distinctly negative when
it comes to killer accessories.

The Orb made tens of thousands by sampling an interview with Ricky Lee Jone=
s and then mixing up her stupidest lines and overlaying chill-trip music on=
 "Little Fluffy Clouds" in 1990. She was upset. The Orb kept all the profit=
s, as far as I know. Today I look back on each of them and they are intrins=
ically linked in my mind. Sampling is an age-old issue. (Quilts and music, =
poetry and drama...) It's probably best to create-your-own rather than remi=
x somebody else's. But if you do sample, do it well?

Must confess, I am terrible at Palindromes, in fact, many have

suggested that I stop trying, in fact, I have been known to be called,

" Palinept", which, more than anything I can imagine, brings home

the point.



No doubt some have seen these lines going round the Net:



Jesus was a Community Organizer.

Pontius Pilate was a Governor.

One can see here the deep antagonism between the writing/creative process
and the world in which that work wishes to or ends up being placed. Art
-particularly poetry- consists of adoptions -secret or open- thefts of other
texts. That's basically what hypertext is. Even Shakespeare, the most
commercial among great poets- stole from right and left. Of course,
Plutarch, his greatest source, was already beyond the copyright statutes on
time limitations. Chaucer's Troylus and Cressida is basically a translation
of Boccaccio's Filostrato, a fact I think undiscovered until the 19th
century. Does that make Chaucer's poem less crucial in the English language?
Did they really care? Did they not have a deeper, more realistic
understanding of the nature of writing?

David, in reference to your most recent post on re-reading: Herzog's movie
Fata Morgana starts with a scene, a fixed camera focused on planes landing
one after another at an airport. Herzog says focusing  (rather, fixing) on
an event for a long time turns a physical fact into a phantasmagoria,
revealing its secrets. The same principle applies I think in Auster's movie
Smoke when Keitel's photographic camera focuses on the same place, exactly
at the same time, months after months.

This seems to be an example of a very old genre, the cento.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cento_(poetry)

Paul K. Saint-Amour writes about that and mosaic poetry in his book
"The Copywrights". A limited preview is available at Google Books:

Glad you suggested that Daniel because Palin can't ever be a palindrome .
It lacks doubles so essential for symmetry. . Palin-drones on the other hand
could be
endless - when she finally comes out of her briefing about the big bad world
fasten your seatbelts - we're in for a bumpy night of platitudes...  So help
me God I love Alaska - oops - I mean that other thing beginning with 'A'...
Albania.. or whaddever...

should be fun...

unless they win and McCain drops dead on the beat.. in which case I'm outta
here - and probably so is Iran.

Let's not think about it!

To give a sense of how this looks from abroad, it's interesting that even a=
 right-wing paper like the Times is publishing commentary such this:

one who has had little is any public exposure. if, for instance, you've been writing for years but have only recently started to publish, you're emerging. i consider myself a submerging writer. which is one who writes underground, seldom seeing any kind of light.

back in the day, Wallace Stevens emerged in his forties.
Emily Dickenson never emerged.

Regarding Copyright Infringement or Collage?

I think of it as the art of appropriation... I really like Burrough's =20=

essay "Les Voleurs" on this topic.  Here it is.  I'm appropriating it =20=

into this conversation....

Barbara Henning



=93Les Voleurs=94, William Burroughs

Writers work with words and voices just as painters work with colors; =20=

and where do these words and voices come from? Many sources: =20
conversations heard and overheard, movies and radio broadcasts, =20
newspapers, magazines, yes, and other writers; a phrase comes into the =20=

mind from an old western story ina pulp magazine read years ago, can=92t =
=20
remember where or when: =93he looked at her, trying to read her mind---=20=

but her eyes were old, unbluffed, unreadable.=94 That=92s one that I =
lifted.

The County Clerk sequence in Naked Lunch derived form contact with the =20=

County Clerk in Cold Spring, Texas. it was in fact an elaboration of =20
his monologue, which seemed merely boring at the time, since I didn=92t =20=

know yet that I was a writer. In any case there wouldn=92t have been any =
=20
Country Clerk if I had been sitting on my ass waiting for my =93very own =
=20
words.=94  You=92ve all met the ad man who is going to get out of the =
rat =20
race, shut himself up in a cabin, and write the Great American Novel. =20=

I alwyas tell him, =93Don=92t cut your input, B.J.=97you might need it.=94=
  So =20
many times I have been stuck on a story line, can=92t see where it will =20=

go from here; then someone drops around and tells me about fruiteating =20=

fish in Brazil.  I got a whole chapter out of that.  Or I buy a book =20
to read on the plane, and there is the answer; and there=92s a nice =20
phrase, too.  =93sweetly inhuman voices.=94 I had a dream about such =20
voices before I read The Big Jump by Leigh Brackett, and found that =20
phrase.

Look at the surrealist moustache on the Mona Lisa. Just a silly joke? =20=

Consider where this joke can lead. I had been working with Malcolm =20
McNeill for five years on an illustrated book entitled Ah Pook Is =20
Here, and we used the same idea: Hieronymus Bosch as the background =20
for scenes and characters taken form the Mayan codices and transformed =20=

into modern counterparts. That face in the Mayan Dresden Codex will be =20=

the barmaid in this scene, and we can use the Vulture God over here. =20
Bosch, Michaelangelo, Renoir, Monet, Picasso=97steal anything in sight.  =
=20
You want a certain light on your scene? Lift it from Monet.  You want =20=

a 1930=92s backdrop? Use Hopper.

The same applies to writing. Joseph Conrad did some superb descriptive =20=

passages on jungles, water, weather; why not use them verbatim as =20
background in a novel set in the tropics? Continuity by so-and-so, =20
description and background footage from Conrad.  And of course you can =20=

kidnap someone else=92s characters and put them in a different set.   =20=

The whole gamut of painting, writing, music, film, is yours to use. =20
Take Molly Bloom=92s soliloquy adn gie it to your heroine. It happens =20=

all the time anyway; how may times have we had romeo and Juliet served =20=

up to us, and Camille grossed forty million in The Young Lovers. So =20
let=92s come out in the open with it and steal freely.

Brion Gysin carried the technique further in an unpublished scene from =20=

his novel The Process.  He took a section of dialogue verbatim from a =20=

science fiction novel and used it in a similar scene. (The science =20
fiction novel, appropriately, concerned a mad scientist who devised a =20=

black hole into which he disappeared.) I was, I confess, slightly =20
shocked by such overt and traceable plagiarism. I had not quite =20
abandoned the fetish of originality, though of course the whole =20
sublime concept of total theft isimplicit in cut-ups and montage.


You see, I had been conditioned to the idea of words as property=97one=92s=
 =20
=93very own words=94 =96 and conseuqnetly to ad eep repubnance fo the =
black =20
sin of plagiarism. Originality was the great virtue. I recall a boy =20
who was caught out copying an essay froma a magazine article, adn this =20=

horrible case discussed in whispers . . . for the first time the dark =20=

word =93plagiarism=94 impinged on my consciousness. Why, ina Jack London =
=20
story, a writer shoots himself when he finds out that he has, without =20=

knowing it, plagiarized another writer=92s work. He did not have the =20
courage to be a writer. Fortunately, I was made of sterner or at least =20=

more adjustable stuff.

Brion pointed out to me that I had been stealing for years: =93Where did =
=20
that come from=97=91Eyes, old, unbluffed, unreadable=92? And that=20
=97=91inflexible authority=92? And that=97=91arty type, no principles=92 =
And that=97=20
and that=97and that? He looked at me sternly.

=93Vous =EAtes un voleur honteux . . . a closet thief.=94 so we drew up =
a =20
manifesto . . .

Les Voleurs

Out of the closet and into the museums, libraries, architectural =20
monuments, concert halls, bookstores, recoding studios and film =20
studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated =20=

thief. All the artists of history, from cave painters to Picasso, all =20=

the poets and writers, the musicians and architects, offer their =20
wares, importuning him like street vendors. They supplicate him from =20
the bored minds of school children, from the prisons of uncritical =20
veneration, from dead museums and dusty archives. Sculptors stretch =20
forth their limestone arms to receive the life-giving transfusion of =20
flesh as their severed limbs are grafted onto Mister America. Mais le =20=

voleur n=92est pas press=E9=96 the thief is in no hurry. He must assure =20=

himself of the quality of the merchandise and its suitability for his =20=

purpose before he conveys the supreme honor and benediction of his =20
theft.

Words, colors, light, sounds, stone, wood, bronze belong to the living =20=

artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the Louvre! A bas =20=

l=92 originalit=E9, the serile and assertive ego that imprisons as it =20=

Steal anything in sight.

Regarding Copyright Infringement or Collage?

I think of it as the art of appropriation... I really like Burrough's =20
essay "Les Voleurs" on this topic.  Here it is.  I'm
appropriating it =20
into this conversation....

Barbara Henning



=93Les Voleurs=94, William Burroughs

Writers work with words and voices just as painters work with colors; =20
and where do these words and voices come from? Many sources: =20
conversations heard and overheard, movies and radio broadcasts, =20
newspapers, magazines, yes, and other writers; a phrase comes into the =20
mind from an old western story ina pulp magazine read years ago, can=92t =
=20
remember where or when: =93he looked at her, trying to read her mind---=20
but her eyes were old, unbluffed, unreadable.=94 That=92s one that I lifted=
.

The County Clerk sequence in Naked Lunch derived form contact with the =20
County Clerk in Cold Spring, Texas. it was in fact an elaboration of =20
his monologue, which seemed merely boring at the time, since I didn=92t =20
know yet that I was a writer. In any case there wouldn=92t have been any =
=20
Country Clerk if I had been sitting on my ass waiting for my =93very own =
=20
words.=94  You=92ve all met the ad man who is going to get out of the rat =
=20
race, shut himself up in a cabin, and write the Great American Novel. =20
I alwyas tell him, =93Don=92t cut your input, B.J.=97you might need it.=94 =
 So=20

many times I have been stuck on a story line, can=92t see where it will =20
go from here; then someone drops around and tells me about fruiteating =20
fish in Brazil.  I got a whole chapter out of that.  Or I buy a book =20
to read on the plane, and there is the answer; and there=92s a nice =20
phrase, too.  =93sweetly inhuman voices.=94 I had a dream about such =20
voices before I read The Big Jump by Leigh Brackett, and found that =20
phrase.

Look at the surrealist moustache on the Mona Lisa. Just a silly joke? =20
Consider where this joke can lead. I had been working with Malcolm =20
McNeill for five years on an illustrated book entitled Ah Pook Is =20
Here, and we used the same idea: Hieronymus Bosch as the background =20
for scenes and characters taken form the Mayan codices and transformed =20
into modern counterparts. That face in the Mayan Dresden Codex will be =20
the barmaid in this scene, and we can use the Vulture God over here. =20
Bosch, Michaelangelo, Renoir, Monet, Picasso=97steal anything in sight.  =
=20
You want a certain light on your scene? Lift it from Monet.  You want =20
a 1930=92s backdrop? Use Hopper.

The same applies to writing. Joseph Conrad did some superb descriptive =20
passages on jungles, water, weather; why not use them verbatim as =20
background in a novel set in the tropics? Continuity by so-and-so, =20
description and background footage from Conrad.  And of course you can =20
kidnap someone else=92s characters and put them in a different set.   =20
The whole gamut of painting, writing, music, film, is yours to use. =20
Take Molly Bloom=92s soliloquy adn gie it to your heroine. It happens =20
all the time anyway; how may times have we had romeo and Juliet served =20
up to us, and Camille grossed forty million in The Young Lovers. So =20
let=92s come out in the open with it and steal freely.

Brion Gysin carried the technique further in an unpublished scene from =20
his novel The Process.  He took a section of dialogue verbatim from a =20
science fiction novel and used it in a similar scene. (The science =20
fiction novel, appropriately, concerned a mad scientist who devised a =20
black hole into which he disappeared.) I was, I confess, slightly =20
shocked by such overt and traceable plagiarism. I had not quite =20
abandoned the fetish of originality, though of course the whole =20
sublime concept of total theft isimplicit in cut-ups and montage.


You see, I had been conditioned to the idea of words as property=97one=92s =
=20
=93very own words=94 =96 and conseuqnetly to ad eep repubnance fo the black=
 =20
sin of plagiarism. Originality was the great virtue. I recall a boy =20
who was caught out copying an essay froma a magazine article, adn this =20
horrible case discussed in whispers . . . for the first time the dark =20
word =93plagiarism=94 impinged on my consciousness. Why, ina Jack London =
=20
story, a writer shoots himself when he finds out that he has, without =20
knowing it, plagiarized another writer=92s work. He did not have the =20
courage to be a writer. Fortunately, I was made of sterner or at least =20
more adjustable stuff.

Brion pointed out to me that I had been stealing for years: =93Where did =
=20
that come from=97=91Eyes, old, unbluffed, unreadable=92? And that=20
=97=91inflexible authority=92? And that=97=91arty type, no principles=92 An=
d
that=97=20
and that=97and that? He looked at me sternly.

=93Vous =EAtes un voleur honteux . . . a closet thief.=94 so we drew up a =
=20
manifesto . . .

Les Voleurs

Out of the closet and into the museums, libraries, architectural =20
monuments, concert halls, bookstores, recoding studios and film =20
studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated =20
thief. All the artists of history, from cave painters to Picasso, all =20
the poets and writers, the musicians and architects, offer their =20
wares, importuning him like street vendors. They supplicate him from =20
the bored minds of school children, from the prisons of uncritical =20
veneration, from dead museums and dusty archives. Sculptors stretch =20
forth their limestone arms to receive the life-giving transfusion of =20
flesh as their severed limbs are grafted onto Mister America. Mais le =20

himself of the quality of the merchandise and its suitability for his =20
purpose before he conveys the supreme honor and benediction of his =20
theft.

Words, colors, light, sounds, stone, wood, bronze belong to the living =20
artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the Louvre! A bas =20

Steven,

For me--I can't speak for Burroughs or anyone else--to appropriate is =20=

part of a transformation of a text I'm working on, almost like adding =20=

a new voice to the conversation and watching what happens to meaning, =20=

narrative, flow of text. . . there's a transformation that occurs in =20
my thinking and in the writing. A dialogic.  I think with "simulation" =20=

we're in a different set of categories.

To appropriate or to work with collage is to multiply, to open up =20
possibilities.  To represent, to simulate is more about the =20
replacement of the whole and then perhaps the replacement becomes the =20=

original.   So I guess if you are appropriating an entire text, then =20
this could be simulating . . . then you have a simulation and if it's =20=

picked up and copied again and again... well then perhaps simulacra.

But for me, appropriation is simpler -- we're in dialogue with writers =20=

and artists and others from before and now -- and we take up their =20
words and characters and images and lines in the same way we take up =20
the language we were born into, in dialogue, not like robots.   And we =20=

don't always footnote and document everything (unless we want to) and =20=

then we keep going with our writing and our work... Of course, some =20
conceptual interventions might want to do just that--replace the whole =20=

with something similar, almost the same, but not quite that--as a =20
political move or just to do it... But then would it be an =20
appropriation?

This poem is carnivorous. It thrives
on living language, especially the flesh
of other poems. It hungers after
every kind of verse: blank, free,
or constrained. It gobbles up haikus,
sonnets, sestinas, odes, villanelles,
chewing them up and spitting out
the rhymes. Each word of this poem,
each letter that you are reading here,
was once a part of a less fortunate poem.
If you look closely you will recognize
nouns, phrases, even whole lines
that originated elsewhere. But who
are you to criticize? You, who are
devouring this poem now, making it
part of your own cannibal soul.

**minor/american
http://www.minoramerican.blogspot.com
minor/american is a small-edition, themed, hand-made poetry journal first
released in the summer of 2007. An offshoot of the minor/american blog,
originated by Maggie Zurawski in 2004, minor/american prints the work of
not-so minor Americans, with a preference for longer selections. The theme
for issue two, due this fall, is citi. Issue three's theme will be
evolution. Submissions can be sent to minoramerican.subs@gmail.com.

http://www.jacketmagazine.com/35/dk-abulhassan.shtml
Samar Abulhassan recently left San Francisco, where she taught poetry to
children, to live among many creatures at a Zen center in New Mexico, where
she wakes early, brews soups, and hears and sounds many bells. She is
finishing a second chapbook for Dusie and recently collaborated with a Buto=
h
dancer in San Francisco on a movement/text piece that was performed at Yerb=
a
Buena Center for the Arts last spring. She waits for the night to surface
words and is looking for a watery landscape to write into.

**Liv Carrow
http://www.myspace.com/livcarrow
Liv Carrow=E2=80=99s songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old niece=
s
and nephews make out of Play-Doh=E2=80=94lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but "all kinds of squishy" on the inside. The mysterious and oddly
lovable bassist from ecstatically weird Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the
True Believers takes the scenic back road to your heart with her clever-ish
observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction,
geography, the unseen world of the earth spirits and cosmic currents,
awkward crushes, metaphysics, and everyone's favorite-despair. Liv plays
frequently in NYC and the surrounding area as a solo acoustic act and
accompanying Huggabroomstik and the burgeoning alternapop collaboration Fee=
l
The Feelings. She is also available for Tarot readings which can be obtaine=
d
for a song

she has been in training since before she could form sentences. After a lon=
g
mid-youth rebellion against her folks, she returned to music in high school
and college where she teamed up with Seth of Dufus and Jeffrey Lewis on
various musical projects, and she can be found on several of their albums.

**Todd Carlstrom and The Clamour
http://www.myspace.com/toddcarlstrom
After Todd Carlstrom recorded his solo album, Gold on the Map, it was clear
to him that the songs deserved more than to simply remain a studio project.
He set about recruiting members of the band that would become Todd Carlstro=
m
and The Clamour. He managed to entice drummer Eric Shaw of The Domestics
into moonlighting. Guitarist Brian Elmquist, a singer/songwriter from
Georgia by way of Nashville, came on in early '08. Their show expertly
intertwines the poppy wrath of The Pixies, the classic rock nods of Built t=
o
Spill, the rumbling slink of Sleater-Kinney, and, occasionally, the odd
stoner jam a la Brian Jonestown Massacre.

**Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://www.dibson.net
http://www.myspace.com/dibson
Dibson T. Hoffweiler is the latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk
ing=C3=A9nues, among them Beck, Adam Green, and Jeffrey Lewis. With a low voice
that=E2=80=99s sweet and deadpan, and a guitar-style that=E2=80=99s virtuosic and slopp=
y,
Hoffweiler carves out a space of compassion and intelligence in a landscape
of boring love songs and thinly veiled songwriterly misogyny. Known for his
work in anti-folk flagship bands Cheese On Bread, Huggabroomstik, and Urban
Barnyard, Dibs began his musical career generating buzz with his old band,
Dibs & Sara. Eventually he established himself as a solo artist, including
several month long tours of Europe and North America. Dibs has proved (to
himself, and to others) that his bizarre, ramshackle aesthetic is palatable
outside the freaky comfort zone of New York anti-folk.
=20
**Dibson T. Hoffweiler and Preston Spurlock
http://www.myspace.com/prestonspurlock
Dibson and Preston have been friends and artistic collaborators since
meeting at the Sidewalk Cafe in 2005. The two forged a tight bond over thei=
r
common love of oddball lo-fi music. For a while they performed together as
Dibs With Machines, and were both members of one-off anti-folk supergroup
Old Hat. They now share a stage as the guitarist and keyboardist of
Huggabroomstik.

Doing Something (Aperture), a collaboration with Chuck Close, is en route
from the Tacoma Museum of Modern Art to the Museo in Santiago, Chile. The

the unique stylings of their female rhythm section=E2=80=94Anne Lieberwirth (bass=

Silent As a Movie (Family Records) and launched an ingenious covers project=

Well said. And this thread is generally quite well done.

It's also true that there is a whole code within art distinguishable from
but related to legal issues concerning what is acceptable, what is
interesting (and so on) concerning appropriation.

But I wonder how these play in such a political climate? The Bush
administration's route to independence from foreign oil has largely been to
appropriate it, to steal it. From Iraq. Yet that is not really widely
acknowledged in the west. Such a climate of denial and doublespeak surely
gets into the bones in how related issues in art appropriation are dealt
with.

There *are* moral issues involved in appropriation. Not simply legal issues,
though the moral issues underpin the legal issues.

They are complex issues, certainly, but they will not go away. Moral issues
never do. And those issues would obtain in any world worth living in.

That said, the issues of appropriation are crucial to contemporary art,
given, say, the explosion of materials on the internet and the proliferation
of creative tools to search and work with that material. These tools, at
least the good ones, the interesting ones, tend to be less involved in
'collage' as 'synthesis'. As in the 'synthesizer', whether it's synthesizing
texts or sounds or graphics or videos or combinations thereof. Beyond
'remix' or 'collage'.

Is there anyone in the list who knows Greek poet Haris Vlavianos ?

I seek some help regarding translation from Greek preferably from a Greek

Please backchannel.

temperature; everything is allegory."

talking to Peachy Peach about the block of time

& sick from kissing

likewize & out of folkus

trying but crimping the script

ad-lib ensued so all the cars had a line

Bullet said something about

how the price of gasoline

equals the end of sharing

chorus: guffaw

Bullet: Starbucks had something to do with it

chorus: guffaw

the poets: taste great less guffaw

Glenn Gould: over easy please

Tracy: 4 phun give glen some funky yolk

DOKUMENT costs $6, and can
be purchased online via paypal at http://petrichord.com/titles.php or
by cash or check (made payable to AARON TIEGER) sent to:

Listen & Be Heard Network Radio Call-in: A time for arts =20
professionals of all
kinds to discuss issues facing all of us, and ways to create creative
prosperity.

Call-in Number:  (718) 506-1481
You can listen to the show and also try the"click to talk" feature by =20=

going to
the following url at 8pm:
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard/2008/09/10/Listen-Be-=20
Heard-Arts-Networking
The podcast will be archived at http://www.listenandbeheard.net

If you can't participate at the time of the show but would like to =20
contribute
your thoughts, you can leave your comments on the Listen & Be Heard =20
Network
Bulletin Board before showtime:
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard/bbpress


Whatever field of the arts that you may be participating in, a major =20
challenge
for all creators today is to make their activities viable. You may =20
make a
living, want to make a living, or not care about making a living in =20
the arts.
If you are serious about your craft, you want it to come to fruition. =20=

You need
the time, resources and tools to make it possible to produce that =20
play, publish
that book, organize that concert or poetry reading.

My experiences have told me that I am more fringe than mainstream =20
with my
creative presentations. My work has run the gamut from written words, =20=

spoken
words, theatre, storytelling, mixing poetry with live music, dance =20
music,
creating mixed new media and more to come. The part about =91more to =20
come=92 is
not in doubt. Whether there will be any financial gain in it is open to
question. Whether finances will ultimately prevent me from expressing =20=

myself is
never open to question. The creative work will be done, but the road =20
ultimately
travelled is certainly determined by whether there is a toll booth, =20
and how
much I have to pay.

There are many opportunities for us to compete with each other. =20
Competition
seems to be the thing in television entertainment these days, and I =20
see it
reflected widely in our culture. How often do the participants have a =20=

say in
the structure of the framework within which they are being presented, =20=

whether
it=92s the stage, the gallery or the printed word? How useful are they =20=

to us?

Please share your ideas with us all by calling in on Tuesday night =20
between 8pm
and 9pm California Time.

The Listen & Be Heard Network Bulletin Board is a place where we can =20
work
constructively together to examine the framework within which we all =20
work. Your
comments and e-mails, your participation in mailing lists, are all =20
ways to give
input; but that input is spread around the network, minimizing its =20
impact. A
bulletin board creates a central area for discussions to take place. =20
The forums
and topics will be determined by the participants. What follows =20
should be
constructive conversation that leads to actions which help us all to =20
thrive as
arts professionals.

Thanks, Barbara, for this. In thinking more about 'simulation', I
suspect one can say 'simulation' is a form of 'self-appropriation' -
that is, each occurrence absolutely mimics its previous manifestation
without any response to its new environment. As say, the way a Marriot
Hotel will architecturally mimic other Marriot Hotels - the company
logo is repeated in the architectural shape of the roof and repeated on
the napkins, etc.=20


Or suddenly, among certain Evangelical sects, we will see Sarah
Palin 'simulins' inundating the Fox Network news! Will Palin sue for
copyright or brand infringement? Hardly.=20



Appropriation, as you use it, is characterized by mutiple multiple
shading of 'the original' in ways that either take us to new
angles/places, or cause the fresh critique of 'the original'=A0
-=A0 if there is such a thing.=20

Steven,

For me--I can't speak for Burroughs or anyone else--to appropriate is =20
part of a transformation of a text I'm working on, almost like adding =20
a new voice to the conversation and watching what happens to meaning, =20
narrative, flow of text. . . there's a transformation that occurs in =20
my thinking and in the writing. A dialogic.  I think with
"simulation" =20
we're in a different set of categories.

To appropriate or to work with collage is to multiply, to open up =20
possibilities.  To represent, to simulate is more about the =20
replacement of the whole and then perhaps the replacement becomes the =20
original.   So I guess if you are appropriating an entire text, then =20
this could be simulating . . . then you have a simulation and if it's =20
picked up and copied again and again... well then perhaps simulacra.

But for me, appropriation is simpler -- we're in dialogue with writers =20
and artists and others from before and now -- and we take up their =20
words and characters and images and lines in the same way we take up =20
the language we were born into, in dialogue, not like robots.   And we =20
don't always footnote and document everything (unless we want to) and =20
then we keep going with our writing and our work... Of course, some =20
conceptual interventions might want to do just that--replace the whole =20
with something similar, almost the same, but not quite that--as a =20
political move or just to do it... But then would it be an =20
appropriation?

I'm a merging writer. I merge traditions together in my work and then
try to force my way into oncoming traffic much to the chagrin of poets
who actually know how to drive.

dear susan --
thanks for noticing -- I got a call a number of years ago from the artist
who got the commission from NJT who had come across my NJ poet's anthology
Bluestones & Salt Hay asking whereabouts of poets he was interested in
using. I agree, the realization is great (especially when the working parts
work) and toimagine Amiri, WCW and Whitman all on display hopefully warping
the minds of my fellow commuters

Poetry is the great art of constructing transcendental health. Hence the
poet is the transcendental physician. [122]

Dear Stephen:

you write:
Fascinating to see Palin introduce paramilitary terms as birth names.
In addition to "Trig" one can soon imagine, if not already found in the
backwoods and urban ghettoes:

AKA, Colt, Hummer, Board  (short for "Water B...), M6, etc.

(You need to read more recent issues of Soldier of Fortune and get the gun
names right, even the old ones--)

Having grown up mainly in the backwoods of Vermont and lived the last seven
years in the "Crack Alley" section of the West Central City of Milwaukee, I
find this knee-jerk stereotyping to be the kind of "profiling" used by the
police who protect gated communities and "good citizens," from these
backwoods and ghetto "scum, and with the use of quite some force, too!
Protesters are handled badly by the police for a few days--the rural and
urban poor their whole lives.

You see, it is the other way round--the paramilitary are used to protect the
Good from the Bad and the Ugly.  Do you think that such force would have
been used against "nice people" as was used against the "trash" at the
polygamous community recently?

Where does the true violence--economic, structural, cultural as well as
military-- come from in this society but from the educated, upper and middle
classes, the research universities, think tanks, the interlocking networks
of corporate-state-"intellectual property" facilities, organizations,
agendas, the lobbies who affect not only foreign policy but what is taught
in schools, what presses are allowed, what is shown in the media, what is
and is not allowed to be discussed in any kind of rational manner, if barely
at all.

Everyday, excruciatingly,  one finds the bandwidth of what is thought,
allowed to be thought, allowed to be written or said, growing narrower and
narrower in the USA.  The "Poetic" concept of separation of referent from
reference is "realized" daily in the news, in which words and things are
separated so no one will "see the connection" between events, ideas,
persons, places.  "The artifice of Absorption" functions at this level as
the opacity of media presenting a "united front"--a seamless series of
"reports," images, soundtracks, edited into discrete series and cycles, in
which the reader indeed is "allowed to create their own meanings" out of
this limited set of  "key words,' "interactive charts and slide shows,"
"options and choices."  Since very little is offered to work with, there is
not much danger of their being any wild divagation in the results obtained.


In the first lines of his Introduction to Torture: Cancer of Democracy
France and Algeria 1954-62, Pierre Vidal-Naquet asks "Can a great nation,
liberal by tradition, allows its institutions, its army, and its system of
justice to degenerate over the span of a few years as a result of the use of
torture, and by its concealment and deception of such a vital issue call the
whole Western concept of human dignity and the rights of the individual into
question?"

The answer to this is most emphatically--yes.

The issue of torture isn't raised by any candidate, nor the treatment of
persons in detention camps and shuttled among local prisons, without medical
care, until they die, as recently happened to yet another detainee in the
"Gitmos Across America."  The treatment of American prisoners in the
enormous and ever more privatized prison system has degenerated steadily, as
have the conditions within the prisons themselves.  Illegal aliens are hired
to work in substandard conditions, then arrested en masse and shoved into
places unfit often for animals.

Human liberty, the freedom of the individual, ideas which generated
Revolutions political and cultural and inspired poets, including the Shelley
who called Poets the Unacknowledged Legislators of the World--all these
things seem to have fallen by the wayside in the rush for Security and in
the "critique of the self," which usually is a critique of others' selves,
that is, those who are less enlightened than the ones charged with the
mission of critique.

Often what one "points a finger at" is a self projection, or, a self
reflection which is unrecognized and called by another's name, so that one
deceives oneself into not seeing oneself, but instead a caricatured world of
stereotyped  "others"  who alone perform the absurdities and evils of the
world.

Sarah Palin seems like a walking caricature to many--yet to her and her
supporters, these laughing critics also seem to be caricatures.  Each "side"
claims to "speak a different language from the other," yet each side sees
the other in the same way.  Are they not then the two faces of the same
coin--or perhaps the doubled reflections of each other, mirror reversed so
as to seem that the "right" and "left" have been "exchanged"?


The New York Times one day runs a story on Fox news using Pentagon Talking
Heads as "propaganda spreaders."  The next day, the Times has back on the
job two of their "crack reporters" most responsible for leading the charge
to War with Iraq--now leading the charge to War with Iran.  It no longer
matters if the "evidence" cited is real, fabricated, blatant lies or
propaganda direct from the Pentagon and IDF--because of the Fox story, one
is meant to assume that the Times is "clean" of such handling.  The educated
readers of the Times everyday fall for tricks that wouldn't fool a
persistent and skeptical child, or a "criminal thinker," because the
"willing suspension of disbelief" has been inculcated to such a deep degree
that, even after the forgeries and lies that "necessitated" the Iraq War,
the public is buying into the same scenarios all over again with regards to
Iran and now Russia as well.

Torture does not aim at producing "truth" so much as producing "speech, ' "a
confession," "a text to sign,"--in short--a betrayal of oneself by the
person tortured.  In a sense, the torture is a form of "Extreme Experimental
Writing Exercise," a method for the production of "transgressive" texts
which form a "critique of the [tortured]self" as an example of the
"superiority of {our} methods and ways of writing, thinking, torturing."

The "formal" critiques and sneers which greeted the poems by the tortured
detainees at Guantanamo on their book publication "proved" that indeed,
readers immune to the circumstances of the poems' creation could  "see them
for what they really are"--"bad poetry by bad people, badly translated by
non-literary translators."

"Hard headed formalists" see themselves as "hard headed realists" for whom
what matters is the text produced.  Removed "formally" from the situation of
the torture chambers, the works can be held up to a ridicule which repeats
in a doubled form the humiliations already heaped on the poets.  A "poetic
justice" is felt to be carried out as inexorably as that "justice" of the
Gitmos making their way around the world and across America.

In many ways, the "formalists" are reflecting the methods used by the
politicians and generals.  Insincerity, in authenticity, artifice, opacity,
transgressions of syntax, grammar, the hybridization of genres, all of these
are practised daily by the government, along with forgeries and the suturing
together of plagiarized texts, the "collaging" of disparate images into
effective propaganda messages, the "formalist" construction of "radical,
innovative" media spectacles which function in a "formal language" of "shock
and awe," filled with ruptures, transgressions, the smahing of "sense," and
their supplanting with a new "language" of "new sentences" to be meted out
for the evil ones.

From all sides, language is used to make separtions, to set up an "us" and a
"them," and so create a sense of supeiriotiy in each side, a supeirotiy
which makes it alll the easier to look down on the "realities on the ground"
in favor of the much more elevated concepts and tones of "culture wars" and
"formalist rigors."  For, it is supposed, that in these rarefied spheres may
be handed down judgements which are created out of language which has had to
pass the muster of an "ideological" purity, as well as a "moral" and
"linguistic" one. Actually, al these three are viewed as the being the same
thing, the One--the Word,  The "real war" being about the Word, makes the
Word paradoxically all the more open to abuse, misuse and manipulation,
despite the claims of its adherents to its veneration as Truth, Justice and
the American Way.

Walt Whitman wrote that the "real War will never get written in the books,"
and so--this War of the Word--is an artifical war, waged to conceal the real
ones.  And being a "formalist," "artifical" war--persons and events, places
and cultures, vanish into caricatures, which in turn produce "judgements"
and in turn produce the need for "security."  For in order to freely enjoy
all these "comforts of home," is it not necessary to be protected from al
those ugly and threatening ones who do not conform to one's own ideas of
what constitutes a "fellow being?"

The "profiling," the stereotyping of "backwoods" people and "urban ghetto
dwellers," necessitates an ever growing number of these populations finding
themselves in prison,('get'em off the streets!")  and, as well, losing their
homes to "disaster capitalism" as Naomi Klein writes of it in The Shock
Doctrine, and to the rewritten laws of Eminent Domain so heavily backed by
the Democrats.  Paramilitary are indeed abroad in the USA--in the form of
private security firms, hired by wealthy communities and private individuals
to protect themselves from the "rabble."  In New Orleans, the wealthiest
such community hired an Israeli firm to protect itself from its fellow
American citizens.

               The USA currently leads the world both in sheer number of
citizens in prisons (over two million now) as well as the percentage of the
population that is incarcerated.  On any given day, a minimum of 30,000
foreign detainees are held in the "Gitmos Across America," as ever bigger
prison camps are constructed for them and their families.  As the recent
events in Postville, Iowa and other towns showed, the  working and living
conditions which people are subjected to are subhuman--and, when arrested,
they are treated like animals at best.

The health care system is basically a eugenics system for getting rid of the
poor and the ill, the "useless," the "mentally defective," the "crack
babies" and "fetal alcohol syndrome children" of the ghettos and
reservations, the backwoods.  The War in Afghanistan--Senator Obama's "Right
War," which now has the US  fighting inside Pakistan--has been the biggest
boom in history for heroin--and it shows all across the USA in the sharp
rise in addictions, deaths, overdoses, diseases associated with needles use
etc.

There is another front to al the Wars going on, and that is here in the
USA--the very people you stereotype with such merry contempt are 24/7
targets of a system which has absolutely no use for them, no interest in
them, thinks of them and treats them as barely being animals.

Racism is making a comeback, too--the law passed this year that
discriminates against American Indians only in refusing them federal Funding
for Abortions, the treatment of illegal aliens and legal aliens, the arrests
and detainment and deaths of foreigners long resident in the US, the open
stereotyping and hatred of Muslims, Arabs, and now, again, the Russians.,
the creation of millions of "internal refugees" in the wake of Karina and
other storms, fires,  factory closings, privatizations of once public lands.


Governor Palin flies a large Israeli flag in her office and believes in
defending Israel to the death.  So does Senator Obama--yet isn't it strange
for a Black Man to run for President to be supporting what the world sees as
Apartheid?  Again, the disconnect between words and things is necessary to
maintain the New Order.

"Divide and conquer," "a house divided against itself cannot stand,"--so it
is one finds such lines being drawn of "us" vs "them" as the stereotyping
of  "backwoods and ghetto dwellers," or "illegal aliens" and "good citizen
employers," who, seemingly without knowing it, have magically employed and
forced to live and work in hells the illegal aliens who when caught are
transfered to new hells.  And the law breaking owners, capitalists,
corporations?  Nothing a little hush money and some high priced lawyers
can't fix.

Is this the  meaning of "freedom," then--that in order to be "free" and live
with oneself, one projects al the evils of a society onto some stereotyped
groups, long the beasts of burden for the ugliness and crime of the
society?

The Indians, the Mexicans, the Blacks, the White Trash, the hillbillies and
gang bangas, the illegal alien, the detainee held without charge and a long
time US resident--the internal refugees cast adrift--the vast millions
drowning without any health care safety net--the millions without
electricity and/or heat--millions who lost their mortgaged homes--

These are the people done violence to in this society, with impunity, on a
daily basis,

Recent laws passed by our shining lights in Congress and the Senate have
handed over almost unlimited powers now to police at all levels, including
the local.  In effect, the paramilitarization without any as yet clearly
defined boundaries of vast numbers of armed and radio equipped, helicopter
backed police at the Local, State and Federal levels---unleashes -a
paramilitarization against the citizenry itself, in order to separate and
maintain those separations of the "wheat" from the "chaff."

Paramilitarization is not found among the backwoods and urban ghetto
dwellers, but among the ruling social, economic and cultural elites, who in
order to keep their hands clean will always dump their dirt and blood on to
the hands of the outcasts of society.  And in order to suppress these "bad
elements," there is a booming Private Security Business in
rent-a-Paramilitary from Israel or the USA to protect yourself from these
dangerous fellow citizens, these homicidal maniacs, these diseased,
deranged, dead end individuals, these "criminals."

To practice the "concealment and deception" which Vidal-Naqet writes of, is
all too easy, for the same inhumanity that is turned on the tortured abroad
and offshore at Guantanamo is spreading across the USA in the detention
camps and the increasingly cruel and degrading privatized prisons, designed
to dehumanize persons already deemed subhuman.

It is all too easy because language has been separated from people, things,
events, ideas, so that it is not important whether the "texts" and "images"
are "true" or not--al that matters is that they maintain that opacity with
which actions, events and persons can be kept hidden from the viewer/reader,
so that the separations so necessary to the maintenance of the status quo
will be ever more strongly put in place, and so construct Walls between "a
great nation, liberal by tradition" and "the whole Western concept of human
dignity and the rights of the individual."

Of course one of those Walls, besides the use of "texts" obtained by extreme
experimental methods, is also that of the Security Forces, the Private
Contractors, the unleashed police at al levels and the return of the program
used in World War Two for the training of various members of every community
in the art of surveillance of the population, seeking for any word or sign,
however trifling, however minutely out of the ordinary, which might be an
indication of indeed an "enemy walking among us."

Or as the famous Pogo cartoon put it--"We have met the enemy and them is
us."

For who else elected these characters to office, these congress people,
Senators, rubber stampers of horrors, as much the perpetuators of War Crimes
as Bush, who, whether elected or not--still has been kowtowed to for years,
along with his crowd of cronies.

Hi all,

I am trying to find some good examples of persona/dramatic monologues and
poems about movies/films for my classes this year. I will be teaching
3rd-6th graders. I have some ideas already but I'm sure there are others
out there I'm unaware of.

It's alright if the poems are somewhat sophisticated, because I believe in
the teaching-by-osmosis method. When in doubt--please send! Name and poet,
URL if you happen to know it.

Thanks in advance...

If you are serious about your craft, you want it to come to fruition. =20=

You need

My experiences have told me that I am more fringe than mainstream =20

There are many opportunities for us to compete with each other. =20
Competition

whether

to us?

Please share your ideas with us all by calling in on Tuesday night =20
between 8pm
and 9pm California Time.

The Listen & Be Heard Network Bulletin Board is a place where we can =20
work
constructively together to examine the framework within which we all =20
work. Your
comments and e-mails, your participation in mailing lists, are all =20
ways to give
input; but that input is spread around the network, minimizing its =20
impact. A
bulletin board creates a central area for discussions to take place. =20
The forums
and topics will be determined by the participants. What follows =20
should be
constructive conversation that leads to actions which help us all to =20

I see where my phrasing created a confusion that prompted you into this
lecture, David! I believe I was saying that it's maybe no surprise at
all that some of the names of Sarah Palin's children resonate with
paramilitary ones - Trig as both a Norse war God, or 'trig' as short
for "trigger.'=A0 Ironically the name is totally inappropriate for a
child with Down syndrome - hardly a warrior.=20



In many respects I hardly disagree with much of what you are saying. So
I don't understand=A0 the rant and condescension that threads
through it. (I think you know enough of my work to know that I am not
the dummy your piece seems to be talking to - or you have not been
reading me at all) Lots of times I find myself fascinated and impressed
with your art works (the bravery of the work). But your anger here I
find toxic and not either beneficial to me, nor I suspect others, nor a
positive way of offering to get through this darkness.=20



I won't indulge being offended, but I am puzzled.=20

Dear Stephen:

you write:
Fascinating to see Palin introduce paramilitary terms as birth names.
In addition to "Trig" one can soon imagine, if not already found in
the
backwoods and urban ghettoes:

AKA, Colt, Hummer, Board  (short for "Water B...), M6, etc.

(You need to read more recent issues of Soldier of Fortune and get the gun
names right, even the old ones--)

Having grown up mainly in the backwoods of Vermont and lived the last seven
years in the "Crack Alley" section of the West Central City of
Milwaukee, I
find this knee-jerk stereotyping to be the kind of "profiling" used
by the
police who protect gated communities and "good citizens," from these
backwoods and ghetto "scum, and with the use of quite some force, too!
Protesters are handled badly by the police for a few days--the rural and
urban poor their whole lives.

You see, it is the other way round--the paramilitary are used to protect th=
e
Good from the Bad and the Ugly.  Do you think that such force would have
been used against "nice people" as was used against the
"trash" at the
polygamous community recently?

Where does the true violence--economic, structural, cultural as well as
military-- come from in this society but from the educated, upper and middl=
e
classes, the research universities, think tanks, the interlocking networks
of corporate-state-"intellectual property" facilities, organizations,
agendas, the lobbies who affect not only foreign policy but what is taught
in schools, what presses are allowed, what is shown in the media, what is
and is not allowed to be discussed in any kind of rational manner, if barel=
y
at all.

Everyday, excruciatingly,  one finds the bandwidth of what is thought,
allowed to be thought, allowed to be written or said, growing narrower and
narrower in the USA.  The "Poetic" concept of separation of referent
from
reference is "realized" daily in the news, in which words and things
are
separated so no one will "see the connection" between events, ideas,
persons, places.  "The artifice of Absorption" functions at this
level as
the opacity of media presenting a "united front"--a seamless series
of
"reports," images, soundtracks, edited into discrete series and
cycles, in
which the reader indeed is "allowed to create their own meanings" out
of
this limited set of  "key words,' "interactive charts and slide
shows,"
"options and choices."  Since very little is offered to work with,
there is
not much danger of their being any wild divagation in the results obtained.


In the first lines of his Introduction to Torture: Cancer of Democracy
France and Algeria 1954-62, Pierre Vidal-Naquet asks "Can a great nation,
liberal by tradition, allows its institutions, its army, and its system of
justice to degenerate over the span of a few years as a result of the use o=
f
torture, and by its concealment and deception of such a vital issue call th=
e
whole Western concept of human dignity and the rights of the individual int=
o
question?"

The answer to this is most emphatically--yes.

The issue of torture isn't raised by any candidate, nor the treatment of
persons in detention camps and shuttled among local prisons, without medica=
l
care, until they die, as recently happened to yet another detainee in the
"Gitmos Across America."  The treatment of American prisoners in the
enormous and ever more privatized prison system has degenerated steadily, a=
s
have the conditions within the prisons themselves.  Illegal aliens are hire=
d
to work in substandard conditions, then arrested en masse and shoved into
places unfit often for animals.

Human liberty, the freedom of the individual, ideas which generated
Revolutions political and cultural and inspired poets, including the Shelle=
y
who called Poets the Unacknowledged Legislators of the World--all these
things seem to have fallen by the wayside in the rush for Security and in
the "critique of the self," which usually is a critique of
others' selves,
that is, those who are less enlightened than the ones charged with the
mission of critique.

Often what one "points a finger at" is a self projection, or, a self
reflection which is unrecognized and called by another's name, so that one
deceives oneself into not seeing oneself, but instead a caricatured world o=
f
stereotyped  "others"  who alone perform the absurdities and evils of
the
world.

Sarah Palin seems like a walking caricature to many--yet to her and her
supporters, these laughing critics also seem to be caricatures.  Each
"side"
claims to "speak a different language from the other," yet each side
sees
the other in the same way.  Are they not then the two faces of the same
coin--or perhaps the doubled reflections of each other, mirror reversed so
as to seem that the "right" and "left" have been
"exchanged"?


The New York Times one day runs a story on Fox news using Pentagon Talking
Heads as "propaganda spreaders."  The next day, the Times has back on
the
job two of their "crack reporters" most responsible for leading the
charge
to War with Iraq--now leading the charge to War with Iran.  It no longer
matters if the "evidence" cited is real, fabricated, blatant lies or
propaganda direct from the Pentagon and IDF--because of the Fox story, one
is meant to assume that the Times is "clean" of such handling.  The
educated
readers of the Times everyday fall for tricks that wouldn't fool a
persistent and skeptical child, or a "criminal thinker," because the
"willing suspension of disbelief" has been inculcated to such a deep
degree
that, even after the forgeries and lies that "necessitated" the Iraq
War,
the public is buying into the same scenarios all over again with regards to
Iran and now Russia as well.

Torture does not aim at producing "truth" so much as producing
"speech, ' "a
confession," "a text to sign,"--in short--a betrayal of oneself
by the
person tortured.  In a sense, the torture is a form of "Extreme
Experimental
Writing Exercise," a method for the production of
"transgressive" texts
which form a "critique of the [tortured]self" as an example of the
"superiority of {our} methods and ways of writing, thinking,
torturing."

The "formal" critiques and sneers which greeted the poems by the
tortured
detainees at Guantanamo on their book publication "proved" that
indeed,
readers immune to the circumstances of the poems' creation could  "see
them
for what they really are"--"bad poetry by bad people, badly
translated by
non-literary translators."

"Hard headed formalists" see themselves as "hard headed
realists" for whom
what matters is the text produced.  Removed "formally" from the
situation of
the torture chambers, the works can be held up to a ridicule which repeats
in a doubled form the humiliations already heaped on the poets.  A "poetic
justice" is felt to be carried out as inexorably as that
"justice" of the
Gitmos making their way around the world and across America.

In many ways, the "formalists" are reflecting the methods used by the
politicians and generals.  Insincerity, in authenticity, artifice, opacity,
transgressions of syntax, grammar, the hybridization of genres, all of thes=
e
are practised daily by the government, along with forgeries and the suturin=
g
together of plagiarized texts, the "collaging" of disparate images
into
effective propaganda messages, the "formalist" construction of
"radical,
innovative" media spectacles which function in a "formal
language" of "shock
and awe," filled with ruptures, transgressions, the smahing of
"sense," and
their supplanting with a new "language" of "new sentences"
to be meted out
for the evil ones.

From all sides, language is used to make separtions, to set up an
"us" and a
"them," and so create a sense of supeiriotiy in each side, a
supeirotiy
which makes it alll the easier to look down on the "realities on the
ground"
in favor of the much more elevated concepts and tones of "culture
wars" and
"formalist rigors."  For, it is supposed, that in these rarefied
spheres may
be handed down judgements which are created out of language which has had t=
o
pass the muster of an "ideological" purity, as well as a
"moral" and
"linguistic" one. Actually, al these three are viewed as the being
the same
thing, the One--the Word,  The "real war" being about the Word, makes
the
Word paradoxically all the more open to abuse, misuse and manipulation,
despite the claims of its adherents to its veneration as Truth, Justice and
the American Way.

Walt Whitman wrote that the "real War will never get written in the
books,"
and so--this War of the Word--is an artifical war, waged to conceal the rea=
l
ones.  And being a "formalist," "artifical" war--persons
and events, places
and cultures, vanish into caricatures, which in turn produce
"judgements"
and in turn produce the need for "security."  For in order to freely
enjoy
all these "comforts of home," is it not necessary to be protected
from al
those ugly and threatening ones who do not conform to one's own ideas of
what constitutes a "fellow being?"

The "profiling," the stereotyping of "backwoods" people and
"urban ghetto
dwellers," necessitates an ever growing number of these populations
finding
themselves in prison,('get'em off the streets!")  and, as well,
losing their
homes to "disaster capitalism" as Naomi Klein writes of it in The
Shock
Doctrine, and to the rewritten laws of Eminent Domain so heavily backed by
the Democrats.  Paramilitary are indeed abroad in the USA--in the form of
private security firms, hired by wealthy communities and private individual=
s
to protect themselves from the "rabble."  In New Orleans, the
wealthiest
such community hired an Israeli firm to protect itself from its fellow
American citizens.

               The USA currently leads the world both in sheer number of
citizens in prisons (over two million now) as well as the percentage of the
population that is incarcerated.  On any given day, a minimum of 30,000
foreign detainees are held in the "Gitmos Across America," as ever
bigger
prison camps are constructed for them and their families.  As the recent
events in Postville, Iowa and other towns showed, the  working and living
conditions which people are subjected to are subhuman--and, when arrested,
they are treated like animals at best.

The health care system is basically a eugenics system for getting rid of th=
e
poor and the ill, the "useless," the "mentally defective,"
the "crack
babies" and "fetal alcohol syndrome children" of the ghettos and
reservations, the backwoods.  The War in Afghanistan--Senator Obama's
"Right
War," which now has the US  fighting inside Pakistan--has been the biggest
boom in history for heroin--and it shows all across the USA in the sharp
rise in addictions, deaths, overdoses, diseases associated with needles use
etc.

There is another front to al the Wars going on, and that is here in the
USA--the very people you stereotype with such merry contempt are 24/7
targets of a system which has absolutely no use for them, no interest in
them, thinks of them and treats them as barely being animals.

Racism is making a comeback, too--the law passed this year that
discriminates against American Indians only in refusing them federal Fundin=
g
for Abortions, the treatment of illegal aliens and legal aliens, the arrest=
s
and detainment and deaths of foreigners long resident in the US, the open
stereotyping and hatred of Muslims, Arabs, and now, again, the Russians.,
the creation of millions of "internal refugees" in the wake of Karina
and
other storms, fires,  factory closings, privatizations of once public lands=
.


Governor Palin flies a large Israeli flag in her office and believes in
defending Israel to the death.  So does Senator Obama--yet isn't it strange
for a Black Man to run for President to be supporting what the world sees a=
s
Apartheid?  Again, the disconnect between words and things is necessary to
maintain the New Order.

"Divide and conquer," "a house divided against itself cannot
stand,"--so it
is one finds such lines being drawn of "us" vs "them" as
the stereotyping
of  "backwoods and ghetto dwellers," or "illegal aliens"
and "good citizen
employers," who, seemingly without knowing it, have magically employed and
forced to live and work in hells the illegal aliens who when caught are
transfered to new hells.  And the law breaking owners, capitalists,
corporations?  Nothing a little hush money and some high priced lawyers
can't fix.

Is this the  meaning of "freedom," then--that in order to be
"free" and live
with oneself, one projects al the evils of a society onto some stereotyped
groups, long the beasts of burden for the ugliness and crime of the
society?

The Indians, the Mexicans, the Blacks, the White Trash, the hillbillies and
gang bangas, the illegal alien, the detainee held without charge and a long
time US resident--the internal refugees cast adrift--the vast millions
drowning without any health care safety net--the millions without
electricity and/or heat--millions who lost their mortgaged homes--

These are the people done violence to in this society, with impunity, on a
daily basis,

Recent laws passed by our shining lights in Congress and the Senate have
handed over almost unlimited powers now to police at all levels, including
the local.  In effect, the paramilitarization without any as yet clearly
defined boundaries of vast numbers of armed and radio equipped, helicopter
backed police at the Local, State and Federal levels---unleashes -a
paramilitarization against the citizenry itself, in order to separate and
maintain those separations of the "wheat" from the "chaff."

Paramilitarization is not found among the backwoods and urban ghetto
dwellers, but among the ruling social, economic and cultural elites, who in
order to keep their hands clean will always dump their dirt and blood on to
the hands of the outcasts of society.  And in order to suppress these "bad
elements," there is a booming Private Security Business in
rent-a-Paramilitary from Israel or the USA to protect yourself from these
dangerous fellow citizens, these homicidal maniacs, these diseased,
deranged, dead end individuals, these "criminals."

To practice the "concealment and deception" which Vidal-Naqet writes
of, is
all too easy, for the same inhumanity that is turned on the tortured abroad
and offshore at Guantanamo is spreading across the USA in the detention
camps and the increasingly cruel and degrading privatized prisons, designed
to dehumanize persons already deemed subhuman.

It is all too easy because language has been separated from people, things,
events, ideas, so that it is not important whether the "texts" and
"images"
are "true" or not--al that matters is that they maintain that opacity
with
which actions, events and persons can be kept hidden from the viewer/reader=
,
so that the separations so necessary to the maintenance of the status quo
will be ever more strongly put in place, and so construct Walls between "a
great nation, liberal by tradition" and "the whole Western concept of
human
dignity and the rights of the individual."

Of course one of those Walls, besides the use of "texts" obtained by
extreme
experimental methods, is also that of the Security Forces, the Private
Contractors, the unleashed police at al levels and the return of the progra=
m
used in World War Two for the training of various members of every communit=
y
in the art of surveillance of the population, seeking for any word or sign,
however trifling, however minutely out of the ordinary, which might be an
indication of indeed an "enemy walking among us."

Or as the famous Pogo cartoon put it--"We have met the enemy and them is
us."

For who else elected these characters to office, these congress people,
Senators, rubber stampers of horrors, as much the perpetuators of War Crime=
s
as Bush, who, whether elected or not--still has been kowtowed to for years,
along with his crowd of cronies.

Dear Poeticists, hi,

My new book of poems 'True Thoughts' has just been published by Salt Publishing

All good wishes
Pam Brown

For more info visit :
http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/9781844714278.htm

Short description/annotation:  True Thoughts follows the success of
Pam Brown's last major collection Dear Deliria awarded the NSW
Premier's Prize for Poetry in 2004. True Thoughts includes poems of
sharply delineated streetscapes, imagined havens, distant places,
encounters with friends, ideas, history, and a kind of fragmented
urbanity. Brown's writing is deftly ironic, and affects a sense of the
ludicrous in the face of mortality, as the poems attempt to fathom the
question 'how to live?' alongside the larger one 'how to live now?'

Hello--I'm mostly a lurker on this list, but I really need some help
and I'm wondering if there might be someone on this list who might come
to my aid and edification.  Does anyone out there have any expertise on
decadence?  If so and if you are interested in what might be a
protracted discussion on same, please back-channel me!
Thanks--ShaunAnne

Came across this from:
http://www.lhcdefense.org/

"Citizens Against The Large Hadron Collider is a non-profit organization established for the purpose of using legal action to prevent the operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) until further safety tests are conducted. The LHC is a particle accelerator located on the France/Switzerland border; it has been dubbed the largest, most expensive, most powerful experiment ever attempted, certainly dwarfing all particle colliders ever built before, both in terms of size and power.
Some experts fear that the risk of operating the LHC disproportionately outweighs anything science might gain from this experiment. It is not possible to know what the outcome of the experiment will be, but even CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) scientists concede that there is a real possibility of creating destructive theoretical anomalies such as miniature black holes, strangelets and deSitter space transitions. These events have the potential to fundamentally alter matter and destroy our planet."
From same site:
"Authoritative astrophysicist Dr Rainer Plaga finds significant gaps in the CERN in-house LSAG safety study. His detailed quantitative analysis published August 10, 2008 comes to the conclusion that "at the present stage of knowledge there is a definite risk from Micro Black Hole production at colliders."
And:
"In a nationwide broadcast, Dr. Wagner explains the dangers of the LHC and his mission to require CERN to undergo further safety analysis before the machine is turned on."

help such as (reading lists, possible conference panelists, ???)?  anyone
without some expertise in decadence out there?

but seriously, this is a bit cryptic.  what would a protracted discussion
about decadence off-list involve?

the A Decadence Reader isn't too terrible, unless you're interested in
decadent poetry, which, this is the POETICS list. then there is the question
of historical decadent / aesthic movement / symbolism and contemporary
writing very influenced by same.

All best,
Catherine Daly

New

computer- and jazz-influenced work.

"Charles is a precisionist of language, an improviser searching familiar
scales for a wrong note, a word or phrase,

of right place." *=97David Antin*

"Charles Hartman's *New & Selected Poems* will finally establish his
rightful place as at least one of the best poets of his generation. It take=
s
a large collection to reveal the range, depth, intricacy, and inventive
playfulness of his very very fine sensibility. Most of all I love his
intelligence=97his refusal of sentimentality that finds an angle for the
release of unexpected yet rich and complex feelings, and his range of
attitudes and situations matched by astonishing metrical inventiveness and
resonance. ('Songlines/tune/the travels.') This intelligence makes for a
range that beggars most poets=97from elegant short dimeter poems to several
sustained and complex long poems on topics ranging from becoming familiar
with exotic places to establishing attitudes toward the ways new
technologies affect possibilities for feeling and for thinking, or for
continuing to think that feeling matters."*=97Charles Altieri*



"Charles O. Hartman is a musician's poet. Those of us who spend our time
looking for melodies, and for ways to hang them together, recognize that
same impulse in his work; his poems sound like the best Tin Pan Alley songs=
,
graceful and concise. His cadences are as unforced as Lester Young's, and
his language as refined. These verses sing." *=97Steve Swallow*





*Flamenco Sketches: *Miles



Still fall
Another drift of sunshine
A day, and then some
No need for snow

Strange creatures scaled down
We tune a canny ear to the unmoved hour

Strung high, the icy cloud sings of a blue trapped in a blue
And so: too

Off on one hand the rind of an undiscarded moon
Off-season fields lie paralyzed for some Persephone
Her place held firm by a zero
*Between's return*

*Then again, the spring's wound one way*

Hi ShaunAnne,
Could you be a little more specific about your query? I mean, do you wish t=
o
discuss the concept (I take it to be a concept - which might be put to use
in describing or evaluating - accurately or misleadingly =AD such and such
sets of facts, and not as a hard fact =AD although it IS a significant fact
that such a concept has been put to use in such and such circumstances)...
do you wish to discuss the concept of decadence "in general" or are you
looking for information about how it was used in such and such historical
contexts? Although not incompatible, the approaches are sensibly different.

During the Manhattan Project, a few scientists worried that an atomic
explosion would ignite
all the oxygen in the atmosphere, killing life on earth (with the possible
exception of the
anaerobic bacteria). Well, no. Not that I defend the aims of that project,
but unless we take
risks based on the best information we have, we will remain ignorant of the
basic structure
of the universe. What should we value more: truth or life? A false dilemma?
Probably. The
LHC hopes to find the Higgs bosonm, among other things. A recent Scientific
American
article speculates that, without the Higgs, atoms might swell to the size of
beach balls.
Well, so what? If all atoms swelled so, could we notice? Yardsticks, too,
would balloon.
So why bother to spend billions to whiff the Higgs? Does it matter whether
we can say
why matter has mass? Well, yeah. No?

From what I've read this just isn't true and not even remotely true below.
On the other hand, I've always felt that eliminating this planet would at
least mean that we haven't a chance of trashing the rest of the solar
system - of course that's chutzpa to the nth degree in the first place.

9/11 AM

Just a brief message--

Lynda and I are okay--stunned and getting our news
from TV (mostly CNN and NY1) as I'm sure you are.
Our main concern is that our daughter-in-law Maggie
works for a law firm very near the WTC (the firm is
at Battery Park Plaza and I *think* that's some
blocks south of the WTC). At any rate, we haven't
heard from her yet, and haven't been able to contact
her firm, or her husband Zach (Lynda's younger son),
who works out on Long Island.

Westbeth, where we live, is well north of Canal St.,
and, while from our livingroom window we can see
a mountain of smoke, the wind seems to be taking
the smoke and debris to the southeast.

We haven't been down to street level as yet today,
a day when normally I would have been taking a
PATH train under the Hudson to travel to Newark,
NJ, where I teach two classes on Tuesdays and
Fridays.

In short, we're well, and we're hoping that Maggie
is too.

Hal

9/11 PM

The first we knew of it this morning was when Ana Doina called from
New Jersey and asked Lynda if we were okay. Lynda (I think--I was
upstairs taking a shower, getting ready to go off to Newark for my
two Tuesday classes) said, "Sure, why? Who is this?" Ana said, "Look
out your window." And Lynda looked out and saw great billows of
smoke rising into the sky. Our windows on that side of the livingroom
look south, but the WLC is blocked from view by an arm of the building
we live in. At night, when we're going to bed we can see the skinny
communications tower at the very top of  . . . I guess it's WTC1. Just
that, and its warning lights--lights intended to warn off aircraft,
strange
to say.

Most of the day, we sat transfixed by the images on the TV screen, one
or the other of us jumping up every now and then to check the billowing
mountain of smoke downtown. The first phone call was from Lynda's
mother in Florida.

It wasn't until a bit after 5:00 in the afternoon that we ventured out
of
the apartment, first to go up to the roof about five floors above us.
Waiting
for the elevator, we checked out the large window near it that until
today
had a clear view of the WTC in all but the foggiest, cloudiest
weathers. Just
smoke, today.A handful of people were up there, looking off to the
south,
where the smoke was still rising, and where a sudden rush of stronger
billowing
may have betokened the collapse of Bldg. 7, which occurred, I think,
about
that time.

It was warm and sunny on the roof. The late-afternoon sun was
sparkling on the Hudson, just across West Street from our building.
One of those gorgeous late-summer evenings--except for the
large smudge of smoke. I remembered living as a kid in an apartment
house at 7th Ave. and 14th St., where for a few weeks during WW2
we could lean out the dining room window and see the black smoke
rising from the French liner Normandy burning where it lay on its
side at its dock at the foot of 14th St.

There aren't many docks along the Hudson anymore. The riverfront
is becoming people space, with miles of pathways for joggers, and
skaters, and bikers. And there were a lot of them down there as
we looked down from the roof. Dog-walkers too. Yes, the dogs
still need to be walked here in New York.

So, we decided to go down and walk for a bit ourselves. West Street
is usually crowded with traffic, especially on weekdays, early in the
morning and in the late afternoon. It's what the West-side Highway
becomes here downtown. Today it was free of trucks, cars, taxis.
Police cars and emergency vehicles were almost all we saw. But in
the park and along the pathways used by joggers and bikers--lots
of folks walking along, riding along, just standing or sitting staring
south. Some people heading uptown, a couple with face masks
hanging around their necks.

We got down to Pier 40, just below Morton Street before coming
to the police barrier, where two officers were turning people back.
A block or two below, lots of emergency vehicles, ambulances,
flashing lights, and beyond them the mountain of smoke where the
WTC had been until this morning. Against the darkness of the
smoke the white and green tower of the Woolworth Building
seemed brighter and more elaborate than ever.

Coming back up, we walked along Hudson Street (what 8th Ave.
becomes south of Bleecker Street) and the scene was really
strange--almost no traffic, some of the sidestreets barricaded
(to secure the precinct house on W. 10th Street, a patrolman
told me). Shops (almost all dark, with their security gates down
and locked) were closed, as were most restaurants (all but a
couple Chinese places). Even the White Horse was closed.

At one point, a convoy of twenty ambulances went by, speeding
north, with wailing police cars fore and aft. The ambulances
I saw were from places as far away as Cherry Hill, New Jersey,
just east of Philly. When emergency vehicles weren't passing by,
the street had that eerie Sunday-morning sort of stillness to it.
What wasn't there was what we saw--the taxis, the trucks, the
twin towers (margarine sticks, I've enjoyed calling them) of the
WTC, the business as usual.

When we got home there were more phone calls and more TV.
We learned from Timo (Lynda's son in Chicago) that Zach and
Maggie had been heading this morning for Century 21, a big
store right across the street from the WTC, to get Maggie a
pair of shoes. Later, Zach called again and told us that he and
Maggie had picked up people walking back into Brooklyn
from Manhattan and ferried them home in their car. Folks on
TV started wondering whether there wasn't some failure of
intelligence involved in all this. Duh, double-duh.

9/11 +1

The wind's changed, and tonight we're getting something of the
taste and smell of the smoke, which plumes north-northeast
through the clear evening sky, Mars standing high over New York
Harbor to the south. We were out only briefly, to walk a couple
blocks south on West Street and cross over to the Hudson River
Park, where we stood for a few minutes looking down at the
WTC area, where some of the standing structures were silhouetted
by emergency lights against the great white cloud arising behind
them.

As we had seen shortly before on the BBC, people along West
Street farther south were cheering and applauding emergency
workers--both those coming north, and those relieving them
going south.

This morning, there was no New York Times outside our apartment
door as there usually is, so after a cup of coffee or two, we headed
out to find a paper.

The Bus Stop, our local breakfast joint, already had a line as we
passed, and we soon found that no newspapers had been delivered
to stores or curbside boxes below 14th Street. And the streets were
empty of traffic--a few emergency vehicles, but mostly walkers
and people on bikes. Most stores were locked and shuttered.

At 8th Ave. and 14th. St., we passed through the police barricades
and headed north, above 14th. St. Non-essential vehicles were
prohibited below 14th St. Basically, we walked up 8th to 23rd St.
and then east to 6th Ave. and then north to 42nd St. We bought
a Post, and then an Observer, and then a Wall Street Journal,
and then a News--but no NYT. So, we walked back west along
42nd St., thinking we'd find one easily at the Port Authority Bus
Terminal, forgetting that the bridges and tunnels were closed, and
thus the buses wouldn't be running. The PA was closed and
barracaded, so we started back down 8th Ave.

We found our Times at Penn Station, two levels down below
street level, at a Hudson News Stand where the guy at the cash
register said there were no more Times at the same moment
another guy was unloaded a new batch onto the floor.

Lynda, our newspapers, and I then continued on down 8th
Ave. until we decided, weirdly, to stop in at the Utopia luncheonette
at the corner of 8th and 27th, the same place we'd stopped
on our walk downtown the very first time I'd trained up to Baltimore
to see her some twelve years or more ago now. Somehow, it
was just a rest stop for us now, and not a bit nostalgic--well,
maybe just a smidgen. So, we ate breakfast, with our unread
newspapers on the chair beside me, and with pop-songs and
Dubya on the PA-ed radio. I had only five bucks in my wallet,
so the waiter and I tried two different credit cards before we
found one for which the telephone call would go through.

People were moving everywhere we went, moving uptown,
downtown, like us with newspapers. Not in Penn Station,
though. There folks were standing in long lines for tickets,
or sprawled in the waiting room (only for ticketed passengers).

At the 14th St. barrier, police were checking IDs of people
wanting to go farther south, into the Village. A woman in blue
was asking two gals and a guy if they had IDs showing they
lived there. Lynda and I just walked past, and were nearly
home. The line outside the Bus Stop was even longer.

Back in the apartment, two messages on the machine told
each of us separately that the Eugene Lang College of the
New School University would be closed today, the building
being used as a clearinghouse/information center for people
who couldn't find people.

So, once again we wavered between CNN and NY1 on the
cable-connected TV. The little one without cable brought
in only Channel 2, the local CBS station. All the other
New York stations were off the air (though not off cable),
since their transmitters had gone down yesterday with the WTC.

Here's what the morning commute in the NYC area
looks like today. This website has pages for places
all over the country, so have a look. This URL is
specifically for the NYC area, but click around and
you'll find others.

My Tuesday-Friday commute is by PATH train to
Newark. I catch the Journal Square train at Christopher
Street, just before it goes under the Hudson River and
into New Jersey.

   "There is now PATH service from 33rd
   Street to Newark/Hoboken every 5-10
   minutes, but there is no service to Exchange
   Place in Jersey City. You must transfer to
   the light rail at Pavonia Avenue. The World
   Trade Center line will be out for perhaps
   several years, or more."

At Journal Square in Jersey City, I usually transfer to the Newark
train, which comes/came out of the WTC. Just outside Jersey
City, the train comes out of its tunnel and travels above ground
the rest of the way into Penn Station in Newark. Much of the
way, the WTC towers were once visible beyond the unseen Hudson.
Tomorrow I'll see a different landscape.

9/11 +30

A couple people lately have asked if we're returning to
anything like normality here in New York, so I though
I'd send one brief (and final) message on this to you.

I think you're already aware of New York's situation--
the clogged streets (improved by the ban on one-passenger
cars on weekday mornings), the downtown streets still
closed, the revenue loss, the Yankees' loss last night,
etc., so I won't deal with much of that.

This morning Lynda and I had to move our car out
of its curbside parking spot for a few hours so the street
could be clean--or rather so the city could once again
pick up some revenue by ticketing and/or towing cars
that don't get moved for street-cleaning. That, according
to the morning New York Times, amounts to $250,000
or so in income for the city each day. So, alternate-side-
of-the-street parking is back for the first time here in
Manhattan since 9/11. The city needs the money.

After dealing with the car, we stopped by the community
room downstairs to cast our votes in the Green/Ferrer
run-off in NYC's mayoral contest--that's the second
time we've voted since 9/11. Who says small-d democracy
is dead?

Not much else. On 60 Minutes II the other night, Charles
Grodin (the weeknight Andy Rooney) did a bit on the
various aches and pains that many of all of us have been
dealing with since 9/11. Lynda's got no voice today. She's
been working her way through the same set of symptoms
I've just about finished with--sore throat, headache,
sneezes, sniffles, mucous running amok, laryngitis, and
so on. I threw my back out (getting up from a couch, it
seemed) on the Thursday after 9/11, and that took about
a week to work itself out, but then I didn't try hanging
upside down from a horizontal bar, as Grodin did.
So, Lynda's napping now, and I'm doing phone duty.

In general then, all's well. Life goes on. How's by you?

every year. . . . [He] is the ultimate 'hyphenated' poet:

each of which he brings an unbridled exuberance and an innovator's
insistence on transforming a given state of affairs." - Charles
Bernstein

Calling works for an unprecedented mashup of two stately publishing venues:

[image: The Mad Hatters' Review & Bunk Magazine]

Wedding date: Spring/Summer 2009
Reception: The Mad Bunkers' Mash & Racket Club, Bronx, NY & Somewhere off
the L.A. Freeway, date TBA

****************

Mashup is the spirit of the day (second only to dementia): Mash a Democrat
and a Tory. Mash a Hip Hop CD with Beethoven's Ninth. Mix the movie Dark
Victory with a modern Japanese horror movie sound track. Cross eclairs with
ecosystems, a Bush speech with a toilet brush. Of course, writers have been
mashing for quite some time with their cutups and exquisite corpses.

Mashup is what happens when content is no longer king, usurped by the
mischievous jester adept at standing on his head and hands, spouting
irreverent nonsensical sense, walking with frivolity on ceilings,
pirouetting on paradoxes, ridiculing rules and rulers, and turning rapid
somersaults -- all for the pleasure of the jester, her audience, and his
sagacious self.

[image: in homage]

WE WILL BE OPEN FOR EMAIL SUBMISSIONS ONLY (madbunkers@yahoo.com cc:
madbunkers@gmail.com) ON SEPTEMBER 1ST. Deadlines vary according to
category.  SEE http://www.madhattersreview.com/submit.shtml for full,

Subject:      CANNOT EXIST #3 is out--submissions open for #4
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hooray! Cannot Exist no.3 is available!

It's a stupendous issue, with 50 pages of poetry by

Alex Burford
Mark Cunningham
Carrie Etter
Lawrence Giffin
William Gillespie
Kevin Killian
Mark Lamoureux
Bonnie Jean Michalski
Sheila E. Murphy
Andy Nicholson
Dirk Stratton

Now that we've had the chance to read it as non-editors, it's blowing our mind with even greater oomph.

Like the first three issues, it features a glossy wraparound cover with odd art (in this case, by the editor), over a cardstock cover, saddle-stapled and assembled by hand in Madison, Wisconsin. As with previous issues, the materials are all acid-free and (except for the cardstock) partially recycled, and all the printing was done at Lakeside Press, our local IWW printing co-op, where even the neighbors are friendly enough to refrain from yelling at the editor when he blocks their driveway as he runs inside to pick up the copies.

All this for a mere four bucks, plus shipping. Oh, such good poetry.

Submissions are open for issue 4 (to come out in December), and will remain so through October 31st.

Subject:      Martin Espada on torture
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I personally do not know Martin Espada's poetry.

However, he was a strong, smart breath of fresh air on yesterday evening's PBS News Hour.

He was the poet - among three other panelists who discussed the consequences of 9/11.

He spoke directly to the way in which 9/11 had been used to abuse and manipulate the language.

Most specifically how the phrase "enhanced interrogation" became a
means to subvert the Law and permit this country to commit acts of
"torture" and make torture 'standard operating procedure'.

Poor Jim Leherer (Sp?) could hardly permit this view (truth) into the
discussion with a respnse of follow up from the other panelists. The
focus was supposed to be on how this country had been abused, and
valiantly recovered (I assume).

Now how we as a nation had used 9/11 to up-end the constitution, etc.

If anybody knows Martin Espada thank him for that!

This is sort of like being a black, woman, or gay Republican, isn't it -- that is, it's
something people do only because it gets them attention that they couldn't get if they
were Democrats because there are so many better-qualified black, woman, or gay
Democrats that declaring  themselves Republicans is the only chance the individuals
have of achieving any fame. Here we have some of the few scientists to oppose the
LHC -- and no doubt it's because they couldn't get a job on the LHC team because
there were so many better-qualified scientists. So now by screaming against it they get
some press.

Besides, I'll bet that you believe the massive consensus of scientists who say that
there is indeed global warming, or who say that cigarets are harmful to your health,
and you disregard the ones who say the evidence is made up of statistical anomalies --
so why would you disbelieve the massive consensus of scientists about the LHC and
believe the few who agitate against it? Either it's reasonable to believe scientists, who
have demonstrated an historic concern for telling the truth as they understand it, or it's
not -- and if not, then why EVER believe them?

in the Emergency Room =96 which is about to be shut down. This is freedom
of choice.

Women
have no choice, even if they die, to carry babies to the maws of death in K=

abstain from touching yourself in those goofy places, abstain from joy, avo=

Capitalism
continues to eat its own. No regulation means constant regurgitation. Banks
kill themselves off like bees. Putrid carcass free market burgers kill off
entire cities like bees, no need for hurricanes. No one checks the meat, no=
 one
checks the drugs, no one checks the ads on TV to buy the drugs, no one chec=
ks
the drug companies who are put in charge of saving the planet in sacred tru=
st
with oil companies. More poor, more pain, more jails, more crank, less scho=
ol,
no science, more God, less compassion, less jobs, more shopping days before=
 Christmas,
less reality, more reality TV, more stupidity, less art, more dead brain.

Actually,
on November 5th, 2008, I expect joy.=20
=20

 =A0
=20

Joy
for a government that, while no means perfect, hears people, that the peopl=
e
have not been fooled one more time, and that the ballot boxes have not been
stuffed, and a black man leads the descendants of masters and slaves,
immigrants and natives, the meager and the mighty, judged by his character =
and
not by the color of his skin. For a government that acts without corporate
veto, that harkens to an America of many-ness and ferment. That allows the
community organizer to reach across the continent to gather the energies of
multitudes to take up the task ourselves.=A0 That you are cared for when yo=
u
are sick, that you are cared for in order not to get sick. The People=92s
Herald watches Great Greed, regulating, not allowing the thoughtless collap=
se
of dreams and the careless injection of poison. That war is not the busines=
s of
America, that problems are solved before countries and peoples are destroye=
d,
that children will learn in schools that can teach, that people can work at
jobs that pay and grow the spirit, that religion belongs to people and not
politicians, that the people take the lead to save the planet, that that we
grow prosperous through the exercise of new ideas, that bees will live, and
songs and all the other expressions take us to the world, and the world bri=
ngs
us thanks, and that courage means living in that world, sharing problems an=
d
promises and power.=20
=20

 =A0
=20

On
November 5th, 2008, I expect it will be possible to imagine all of
these things, and more.
=20

 =A0
=20

Which
America do you expect on November 5th, 2008? What will you do to make it
happen?

How many people are familiar with Gene Fowler? Ismael Reed dicusses the bastard children of Gary Synder in "From Totems to Hip-HOp." He's cool with Synder. & Synder did, after all, do his homework. But along come the shaman wanna-bees. Yeah. Reed is on to something. He's dead right, I think, about Fowler.

NEW CHAPBOOK BY MARK TERRILL FORTHCOMING FROM MAIN STREET RAG



A new 40-page chapbook of my poems, The Salvador-Dalai-Lama Express, is =
tentatively scheduled for publication on November 17, 2008. The =
publisher, Main Street Rag, is offering an advance order discount =
through November 10th. Until that date, copies of the chapbook can be =
ordered for $7.00 instead of the regular $10.00 cover price.

=20

To make an advance order, go to Main Street Rag's Coming Soon Page and =
place your order via PayPal, which is the preferred method of payment. =
You'll find separate links for domestic & overseas orders. The advance =
discount price applies to online sales ONLY.=20

Both the release date and the size of the press run will be determined =
in part by the amount of advance sales, so your orders are important, as =
well as a good way to save some money. You'll also be supporting that =
endangered species known as the "small press." Here's an excerpt from =
The Salvador-Dalai-Lama Express:

CHARLES MONTGOMERY=A0(1879)
by Michael Hare

All winter my wife, who was heavy with child,
Had cravings for coconuts.=A0In the morning,
In the middle of the night, coconuts, coconuts!
Finding a coconut in Saratoga in the middle of March
is like finding a rowboat in the Grand Union Hotel,
So when Dennis Alvord went to New York,
I asked him to bring back a coconut.
It was large, perfect in shape, and
My wife excitedly cracked it open,
Only to find it rotted on the inside.
In May our child was stillborn and the promised milk
Is dried and hardened.
In daylight and at night
I roam through Saratoga, observing its
Elegant hotels, splendid parks and delightful springs
And ask myself:
If the whole business were bared,
How much would be diseased within?

Hello,

I've lurked on this list for a few years, and very much enjoyed reading m=
any
posts. Not an academic and not much of a poet I've never posted. Anyway,
what I do do is work in classical music and I am producing an operatic
adaptation of The Burial at Thebes which will be designed and directed by=

Derek Walcott. The show opens at Shakespeare's Globe, London in about a
month. Anyway, I thought I'd let you all know as you might find it
interesting to discuss one poet directing another's work.

Interesting. I was thinking about poets and playwrighting recently, cuz, back in the day, lots of heavy hitters were involved in the theatre. Yeats, in a big big way. & Eliot, of course. & Rilke, too, although I'm not sure how involved Rilke actually was with the theatre, but he did write plays. & Walcott has written a number of successful plays. Seamus H, I don't think has written an original play, but he's done that very good adaptation, and now he directs.

Of contemporary playwrights, at least among the Americans, I know that Sam Shepard and Mamet have written poems, and Shepard has had some interesting experimental plays that have included poetry. & of course, back back back in the day, there was also Bertold Brecht. although he's no further back than either Yeats, Rilke, or Eliot. Ugh, Shakespeare, Marlow, Johnson, & that Greek thing that Heaney's directing. That's going far back.

Congratulations, Harry. What a 'cast' already: Walcott and Heaney.
Perhaps Les Murray could have a part in the chorus ... or perhaps he
could BE the chorus!

Break a leg, Harry. I wish I could see it, but alas, am too far away.
Steve, the question about poetry and theatre has exercised me often.
I've sometimes wondered why poets seem less interested than once they
were, because theatre is a fascinating art if you're interested in
poetry, or so it seems to me. Not that there's not contemporary
connections - The UK poet Chris Goode is well known in Britain as a
theatre maker, for instance. And the playwright Howard Barker is a
fine poet himself. Charles Bernstein has close connection to Richard
Foreman and has written libretti himself. Etc etc. Dig a bit and
you'll find things. Myself, I've written three libretti (two of which
have been produced) and a number of plays for stage and radio. Fwiw,
my most recent Salt collection is called THEATRE...

I run a blog which reviews and discusses theatre here in Melbourne
(occasionally in London, if I'm there) which might interest you -

All the best

I read Infinite Jest when I was eighteen. I picked it up on a lark at
the Tower Records bookstore on Newbury Street in Boston. I needed
something to read to take my mind off the music that had encompassed
all of my waking brain time in my first semester at Berklee. It was
thick and I figured it would keep me busy for a while at least.
Little did I know.

Four months later after dilligently working through that monster of a
novel, i was quite possibly a different person. it was precisely the
right book for me to read at precisely the right time in my life. I'm
not sure it would be possible for me to state completely how much an
influence his voice had on both my writing and my views on art in
general. suffice it to say that i doubt there is anyone else I've
ever read who had a greater impact.

the future with no more of the brilliance from that man's brain to
come when there should have been so much more is not as good as the
one we had a few days ago. his is a terrible loss to American
literature.

over the years, I've known a few brilliant people who  decided to
take their own lives. it never makes any sense. having sat on that
fence once or twice myself, I can't even fathom my own thoughts in
that direction, and feel very grateful for the confidence I've found
to know that i will never go there again. suicide is one of the great
tragedies of our form of life, a gesture at eternity that expresses a
pain that defies words. I'm not a religious person, but I hope with
all my heart that whatever pain Wallace was feeling he has some peace
and relief from it now. I hope he knew at the end how much he and his
work meant even to people like me who had never even met him. At the
risk of hyperbole, we are all darkened a bit when our brightest
lights go out, and there is no question in my mind that David Foster
Wallace was such a light.

Godspeed sir, my life has been better because of what you have given
us all.

Wow. The DFW death in particular really saddens me. I wonder to what =
degree the guy was at bottom tortured by hyper-consciousness. His work =
suggests as much.

David taught for years in the English department here at ISU. Charlie
Harris, former chair, sent this link to the department listserv today. I
never met him, he left for Pomona the year I got to Normal, but folks here,
both on campus and in town, still talk about him with such love -- not only
for his writing but for his heart and warmth. He was they say a genuinely
beautiful man.

Lion Books announces a new hardback book by Sheila E. Murphy, COLLECTED
CHAPBOOKS (1981 - 2002). A collection of all Murphy's chapbooks issued
during that period, many out of print and now available in a beautiful
hardcover edition.

"For three decades, Sheila E. Murphy has been been one
of the master architects of American syntax. Those who have read her
poems only in magazines or chapbooks have no idea of their scope, the
scale and the depth of her work. For those readers, this collection
will be a revelation. This is a great book!"     --- Ron Silliman

"Sheila E. Murphy is indeed a virtuoso bird, one
who takes flight through language at the slightest provocation,
carrying her readers with her on long poetic journey. These poems are
about linguistic experience, about music on the page and in the head,
about ideas approached from surprising angles and made anew, about
renewal and revival. Over the last twenty five years I have continually
migrated towards Sheila's approachable, lyrical and engaging
experiments, basking in the sun-drenched visions she has gathered and
made from the worlds and words about her. Collected Chapbooks is an
overdue delight, a tribute and a publishing event."    --- Rupert
Loydell

http://www.lulu.com/content/2251616
  is
the web-address for ordering this book. The book has much to merit
purchasing a copy to enrich one's experience of contemporary poetry. In
reading this book, you will be amazed at the variety of her poetic
discourse, no doubt, in paraphrase, falling in love along with the the
spell of her bright syntax.

MICHIKO KAKUTANI | An Appraisal SEP. 15, 2008

Writer Mapped the Mythic and the Mundane

David Foster Wallace =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/david_foste=
r_wallace/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>  used his prodigious gifts as a =
writer - his manic, exuberant prose, his ferocious powers of =
observation, his ability to fuse avant-garde techniques with =
old-fashioned moral seriousness - to create a series of strobe-lit =
portraits of a millennial America overdosing on the drugs of =
entertainment and self-gratification, and to capture, in the words of =
the musician Robert Plant, the myriad "deep and meaningless" facets of =
contemporary life.=20

A prose magician, Mr. Wallace was capable of writing - in his fiction =
and nonfiction - about subjects from tennis to politics to lobsters, =
from the horrors of drug withdrawal to the small terrors of life aboard =
a luxury cruise ship, with humor and fervor and verve. At his best he =
could write funny, write sad, write sardonic and write serious. He could =
map the infinite and infinitesimal, the mythic and mundane. He could =
conjure up an absurd future - an America in which herds of feral =
hamsters roam the land - while conveying the inroads the absurd has =
already made in a country where old television shows are a national =
touchstone and asinine advertisements wallpaper our lives. He could make =
the reader see state-fair pigs that are so fat they resemble small =
Volkswagens; communicate the weirdness of growing up in Tornado Alley, =
in the mathematically flat Midwest; capture the mood of Senator John =
McCain =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> 's old "straight talk" campaign of 2000.=20

Mr. Wallace, who died Friday night at his home in Claremont, Calif., at =
46, an apparent suicide, belonged to a generation of writers who grew up =
on the work of Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/don_delillo=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>  and Robert Coover =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/robert_coov=
er/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> , a generation that came of age in the =
'60s and '70s and took discontinuity for granted. But while his own =
fiction often showcased his mastery of postmodern pyrotechnics - a cold =
but glittering arsenal of irony, self-consciousness and clever narrative =
high jinks - he was also capable of creating profoundly human =
flesh-and-blood characters with three-dimensional emotional lives. In a =
kind of aesthetic manifesto, he once wrote that irony and ridicule had =
become "agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture" and =
mourned the loss of engagement with deep moral issues that animated the =
work of the great 19th-century novelists.

For that matter, much of Mr. Wallace's work, from his gargantuan 1996 =
novel "Infinite Jest" to his excursions into journalism, felt like =
outtakes from a continuing debate inside his head about the state of the =
world and the role of the writer in it, and the chasm between idealism =
and cynicism, aspirations and reality. The reader could not help but =
feel that Mr. Wallace had inhaled the muchness of contemporary America - =
a place besieged by too much data, too many video images, too many =
high-decibel sales pitches and disingenuous political ads - and had so =
many contradictory thoughts about it that he could only expel them in =
fat, prolix narratives filled with M=F6bius strip-like digressions, =
copious footnotes and looping philosophical asides. If this led to =
self-indulgent books badly in need of editing - "Infinite Jest" clocked =
in at an unnecessarily long 1,079 pages - it also resulted in some =
wonderfully powerful writing.=20

He could riff ingeniously about jailhouse tattoos, videophonic stress =
and men's movement meetings. A review of a memoir by the tennis player =
Tracy Austin became a meditation on art and athletics and the mastery of =
one's craft. A review of a John Updike =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/u/john_updike=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>  novel became an essay on how the "brave =
new individualism and sexual freedom" of the 1960s had devolved into =
"the joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation."=20

Although his books can be uproariously, laugh-out-loud funny, a dark =
threnody of sadness and despair also runs through Mr. Wallace's work. He =
said in one interview that he set out with "Infinite Jest" "to do =
something sad," and that novel not only paints a blackly comic portrait =
of an America run amok, but also features a tormented hero, who is =
reeling from his discovery of his father's bloody suicide - his head =
found splattered inside a microwave oven. Other books too depict =
characters grappling with depression, free-floating anxiety and plain =
old unhappiness. One of the stories in "Oblivion" revolved around a =
cable TV startup called "the Suffering Channel," which presented "still =
and moving images of the most intense available moments of human =
anguish."

Like Mr. DeLillo and Salman Rushdie, and like Dave Eggers =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/dave_eggers=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> , Zadie Smith =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/zadie_smith=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>  and other younger authors, Mr. Wallace =
transcended Philip Rahv's famous division of writers into "palefaces" =
(like Henry James =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/henry_james=
/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>  and T. S. Eliot =
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/t_s_eliot/i=
ndex.html?inline=3Dnyt-per> , who specialized in heady, cultivated works =
rich in symbolism and allegory) and "redskins" (like Whitman and =
Dreiser, who embraced an earthier, more emotional naturalism). He also =
transcended Cyril Connolly's division of writers into "mandarins" (like =
Proust, who favored ornate, even byzantine prose) and "vernacular" =
stylists (like Hemingway, who leaned toward more conversational tropes). =
An ardent magpie, Mr. Wallace tossed together the literary and the =
colloquial with hyperventilated glee, using an encyclopedia of styles =
and techniques to try to capture the cacophony of contemporary America. =
As a result his writing could be both brainy and visceral, fecund with =
ideas and rich with zeitgeisty buzz.

Over the years he threw off the heavy influence of Mr. Pynchon that was =
all too apparent in "The Broom of the System" (1987) - which, like "The =
Crying of Lot 49," used Joycean word games and literary parody to =
recount the story of a woman's quest for knowledge and identity - to =
find a more elastic voice of his own in "Infinite Jest." That novel used =
three story lines - involving a tortured tennis prodigy, a former =
Demerol addict and Canadian terrorists who want to get their hands on a =
movie reputed to be so entertaining it causes anyone who sees it to die =
of pleasure - to depict a depressing, toxic and completely =
commercialized America. Although that novel suffered from a lack of =
discipline and a willful repudiation of closure, it showcased Mr. =
Wallace's virtuosity and announced his arrival as one of his =
generation's pre-eminent talents.

Two later collections of stories - "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men" =
(1999) and "Oblivion" (2004), which both featured whiny, narcissistic =
characters - suggested a falling off of ambition and a claustrophobic =
solipsism of the sort Mr. Wallace himself once decried. But his ventures =
into nonfiction, "A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again" (1997) and =
"Consider the Lobster" (2005), grounded his proclivity for meandering, =
stream-of-consciousness musings in sharp magazine assignments and =
reportorial subjects, and they evinced the same sort of weird telling =
details and philosophical depth of field as his most powerful fiction. =
They reminded the reader of Mr. Wallace's copious gifts as a writer and =
his keen sense of the metastasizing absurdities of life in America at a =
precarious hinge moment in time.?

Hi - has anyone been keeping up the ruling in Virginia that that the
state's "anti-spam law violates free speech protections under the
First Amendment"? This seems so strange and poetic to me - that bulk
email, not even the content of the email, is speech. Any thoughts?

RICHMOND, Va. =97 The Virginia Supreme Court has declared the state's
anti-spam law unconstitutional.

The unanimous ruling Friday reversed the conviction of a man once
considered one of the world's most prolific spammers. The court agreed
with Jeremy Jaynes' claim that the anti-spam law violates free speech
protections under the First Amendment. In 2004, Jaynes became the
first person in the country to be convicted of a felony for sending
unsolicited bulk e-mail. Authorities claimed Jaynes sent up to 10
million e-mails a day from his home in Raleigh, N.C. He was sentenced
to nine years in prison.
Jaynes was charged in Virginia because the e-mails went through an AOL
server there.

The Parasol Unit Readings Series is pleased to announce that the series wil=
l resume on Thursday, 25 September at 7 pm with a reading by Ian Hunt.
=C2=A0
Ian Hunt is a writer, art critic and editor, who has lived and worked in Lo=
ndon since the mid-1980s. He was the publisher of the poetry imprint Alfred=
 David Editions between 1994 and 2001, and has edited two books of criticis=
m by Stuart Morgan. He finally got around to publishing a book of his own p=
oems, Green Light (Barque Press) in 2006.

Barque said this about his writing: "From the politesse of =E2=80=98En Eche=

the defensive operations of =E2=80=98Lines Inscribed on a Gauntlet=E2=80=99=
, Green Light reveals the powers and limits of resistant speech. In these p=
oems, ironic formality as form of defence, echoed by the formalism of narra=
tive or of mise-en-page, is softened by a context which dwells consistently=
 on the construction of personal and semantic relations through contrasting=
 tonal registers which both alienate and familiarize=E2=80=A6 Maybe the des=

Parasol Unit is located at 14 Wharf Road, London N1 7RW, between Old Street=

This is no surprise though. Ashbery was a keen student of art (esp.
paintings) since early childhood. Read somewhere that at age 9 he was well
versed with French surrealist paintings - at least he could put names to
paintings (or styles). Later during (or may be after) his Paris sojourn he
took painting/art classes to formally learn to paint.

Its also true that in one of his interviews (possibly the 1988 John Tranter
interview) he laments about his lack of talent as a painter.

Given the facts, I am inclined to think he is perhaps a better pianist than
painter/artist.

2009 PEDAGOGY FORUM: Association of Writers and Writing Programs

http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2009pedforum.php

2009 AWP Annual Conference & Bookfair
February 11-14, 2009
Chicago, Illinois
Hilton Chicago

AWP's Pedagogy Forum is now accepting submissions. The deadline to submit a paper is October 15, 2008. The guidelines for Pedagogy Papers and participation in the Forum have changed, so be sure to consult the guidelines.  Submitting work to The AWP Pedagogy Papers 2009 represents an application to present at a session of the Pedagogy Forum. As with other AWP panels, readings, and roundtables, authors of accepted papers will be assigned a session time to share their ideas.

Topics must address the teaching of creative writing and may cover the application of pedagogical theory, specific course development, classroom activities, assignments, texts, or other aspects of teaching. Papers must be designated by one of the following genres: Drama, Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, or Multi-Genre. We are especially interested in receiving more papers that focus on drama. You may contact the coordinators if you feel your paper doesn't fall under one of these categories. Papers must also be designated by level as Undergraduate, Graduate, Any Level, or Alternative (elementary/secondary school, writing in community settings, etc.).

A collection of 20 selected papers, The Best of The AWP Pedagogy Papers 2009, will be made available to members online after the conference. All contributors to The AWP Pedagogy Papers 2009 will present and discuss their papers in small groups during one of the Pedagogy Forum sessions at the conference.

not a libretti  a libretto

usually in old days librettist  was forgotten like the leider writer
or even when folks talk of burt bacharach or elton john you rarely har
about hal david or bernie taupin
in some cases the librettist and composer were one in the same
ditto leider as in the case with certain mahler leider
and as i once wrote in a poem
if the opera's a success they praies the composer
if it's a flop they blame the librettist

Dear Friends,

I'll be back in the Bay Area to read in the Best
American Poetry 2008 release with Robert Hass, Michael
Palmer, Brenda Hillman, and D.A. Powell.  I'd love to
chance to see some of you one more time, before I
disappear into the Michigan snow. It's a lovely book,
selected this year by Charles Wright.

The reading is at Mrs. Dallaway's Bookstore in
Berkeley
7:30, Tuesday, September 16
2904 College Ave., Berkeley

Cheers,
Chad Sweeney

This is no surprise though. Ashbery was a keen student of art (esp.
paintings) since early childhood. Read somewhere that at age 9 he was well
versed with French surrealist paintings - at least he could put names to
paintings (or styles). Later during (or may be after) his Paris sojourn he
took painting/art classes to formally learn to paint.

Its also true that in one of his interviews (possibly the 1988 John Tranter
interview) he laments about his lack of talent as a painter.

Given the facts, I am inclined to think he is perhaps a better pianist than
painter/artist.

(2005, translated into Galician as Teatriños, 2007); O Cidadán (2002), a

on Tuesday, September 16 from 8-9 pm California time.

You can tune into the show live at the following url:
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard/2008/09/17/Listen-Be-
Heard-Poetry-Open-Mic

You can call in to the following phone# 718-506-1481 during the live
show.
You can also try the "click to talk" feature from your computer,
although so far I haven't been able to communicate with the people
who have
tried it...
but I'm willing to keep trying (it is in beta.)

Here is the open mic format for Tuesday night:
There will be two rounds of open mic:
the lightning round and the spotlight round.
The lightning round will be one poem for 30 seconds or less.
The spotlight round will be one poem.
I have not scheduled any featured poets.

During the previous two radio open mics that I hosted this way,
poets called in from around the country,
and we had fun.

Please listen and be heard on Tuesday night.

Wishing you Peace and Poetry
Martha Cinader Mims

Subject:      SMALL PRESS in the ARCHIVE: Rich Owens Lecture Tues Sept. 16
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

For those in or near Buffalo New York:

The first of the Fall 2008 Small Press in the Archive lectures. Our very own
poet, scholar and master at letter press, Richard Owens, will give his talk
"Editing Joseph Gordon Macleod" at NOON this coming Tuesday, September 16th
in the Poetry Collection, 420 Capen, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New
York.

Rich's project is a fascinating one---an act of recovery work which promises
to
trouble the way we think about reception and canon formation. Praised by
Pound,
Bunting and MacDiarmid, Macleod's The ECLIPTIC (1930) came in with a roar
and out
with a whimper. A subject of debate between Pound and Zukofsky during the
planning stages of the Objectivist and British numbers of POETRY, Macleod
produced two "modernist" long poems before retreating behind the security of
the
pseudonymous persona of Scottish Nationalist Adam Drinan. Answering Keith
Tuma's
call to investigate and recover the work of British poets written out of
American
conversations, this talk will wrestle with the usefulness of recovery
projects,
the question of reception and the need to develop project-specific editing
strategies grounded in the archive.

_Small Press in the Archive_Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

Hope to see many of you tomorrow,
Margaret

              Kerouac Writer in Residence reads at Soft Exposure
MIME-Version: 1.0

This Wednesday's featured writer will be Judy Copeland, the current writer
in residence at the Kerouac House. The location is Infusion Tea, College
Park, 1600 Edgewater Drive, Orlando. Open mic signup starts at 6:30, and the
reading starts at 7. Come on out to listen and share your
words!

Judy Copeland is a California attorney who left the law to backpack
around Oceania, Asia, and Africa, staying with families she met along
the way. Her travel stories have appeared in the Florida Review,
Literal Latte, Water~Stone Review, New Millennium Writings, and
Travelers' Tales anthologies. She holds an MFA in creative nonfiction
from the University of Iowa.

Judy's wanderlust began early. A child of missionaries, she grew up in
Fukuoka, Japan, where she used to run away from home every few days,
just for the thrill of getting lost in a big city. By the age of
three, she had grown accustomed to policemen catching her and taking
her home. While at the Kerouac House, Judy will work on stories about
her childhood in Fukuoka in the 1950s.

Thanks
Russ Golata

I would like to ask the list abt. tibor de nagy -- I go there when I live in
or visit NYC -- but the looks I get are so strange when I react to the work
and ask for the books and monographs they publish ("have you got any artist
or poet publications here now?  may I buy copies?"), and -- wow, they are
the books of mine stolen most readily when loaned (i.e., desireable,
unavailable) -- it is odd.

Samar Abulhassan recently left San Francisco, where she taught poetry to
children, to live among many creatures at a Zen center in New Mexico, where
she wakes early, brews soups, and hears and sounds many bells. She is
finishing a second chapbook for Dusie and recently collaborated with a Buto=
h
dancer in San Francisco on a movement/text piece that was performed at Yerb=
a
Buena Center for the Arts last spring. She waits for the night to surface
words and is looking for a watery landscape to write into.

**Liv Carrow
http://www.myspace.com/livcarrow
Liv Carrow=E2=80=99s songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old niece=
s
and nephews make out of Play-Doh=E2=80=94lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but "all kinds of squishy" on the inside. The mysterious and oddly
lovable bassist from ecstatically weird Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the
True Believers takes the scenic back road to your heart with her clever-ish
observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction,
geography, the unseen world of the earth spirits and cosmic currents,
awkward crushes, metaphysics, and everyone's favorite-despair. Liv plays
frequently in NYC and the surrounding area as a solo acoustic act and
accompanying Huggabroomstik and the burgeoning alternapop collaboration Fee=
l
The Feelings. She is also available for Tarot readings which can be obtaine=
d
for a song

**Todd Carlstrom and The Clamour
http://www.myspace.com/toddcarlstrom
After Todd Carlstrom recorded his solo album, Gold on the Map, it was clear
to him that the songs deserved more than to simply remain a studio project.
He set about recruiting members of the band that would become Todd Carlstro=
m
and The Clamour. He managed to entice drummer Eric Shaw of The Domestics
into moonlighting. Guitarist Brian Elmquist, a singer/songwriter from
Georgia by way of Nashville, came on in early '08. Their show expertly
intertwines the poppy wrath of The Pixies, the classic rock nods of Built t=
o
Spill, the rumbling slink of Sleater-Kinney, and, occasionally, the odd
stoner jam a la Brian Jonestown Massacre.

**Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://www.dibson.net
http://www.myspace.com/dibson
Dibson T. Hoffweiler is the latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk
ing=C3=A9nues, among them Beck, Adam Green, and Jeffrey Lewis. With a low voice
that=E2=80=99s sweet and deadpan, and a guitar-style that=E2=80=99s virtuosic and slopp=
y,
Hoffweiler carves out a space of compassion and intelligence in a landscape
of boring love songs and thinly veiled songwriterly misogyny. Known for his
work in anti-folk flagship bands Cheese On Bread, Huggabroomstik, and Urban
Barnyard, Dibs began his musical career generating buzz with his old band,
Dibs & Sara. Eventually he established himself as a solo artist, including
several month long tours of Europe and North America. Dibs has proved (to
himself, and to others) that his bizarre, ramshackle aesthetic is palatable
outside the freaky comfort zone of New York anti-folk.

**Dibson T. Hoffweiler and Preston Spurlock
http://www.myspace.com/prestonspurlock
Dibson and Preston have been friends and artistic collaborators since

Dibs With Machines, and were both members of one-off anti-folk supergroup
Old Hat. They now share a stage as the guitarist and keyboardist of
Huggabroomstik.

LOGOchrysalis Productions is a small literary/musical enterprise founded in
2007 by Brooklyn-based poet/writer and composer/musician Brant Lyon. In the
early spring of 2008 LOGOchrysalis debuted its first work, Brant Lyon &
Friends=E2=80=99 Beauty Keeps Laying Its Sharp Knife Against Me, a CD anthology o=
f
eight notable New York City poets performing their poetry set to music
composed and performed by Lyon, who also executive produced the album. In
this highly eclectic collection, whose music integrates a wide range of
genres from hard-driving R&B/funk to ambient/soundscape, an equally
far-ranging array of poetic styles and subjects take the listener on a
journey from the mid-way of Coney Island to the war-torn jungles of =E2=80=9970s
Cambodia to the Dead Sea of Palestine to a ride in a spaceship with alien
abductors, and stops in between. LOGOchrysalis expects its second poemusic
CD to be published early next year.

Dear All=2C
I seem to remember a very brief thread that discussed this=2C a part of whi=
ch was a rather interesting and thorough-seeming (and geographically quite =
"wide") etymological development that related "clitoris" to "guitar" among =
other things . . . I think the post was from Gabriel Gudding=2C but haven't=
 a clue as to the year. =20
=20
I just did a search through through the UB archives which turned a blank . =
. . does anyone recall this thread=2C and its details?  If so=2C b/c me if =
you want=3B I remain most curious about it all.

not a libretti  a libretto

usually in old days librettist  was forgotten like the leider writer
or even when folks talk of burt bacharach or elton john you rarely har
about hal david or bernie taupin
in some cases the librettist and composer were one in the same
ditto leider as in the case with certain mahler leider
and as i once wrote in a poem
if the opera's a success they praies the composer
if it's a flop they blame the librettist

The grimmest Christmas Day i spent was in the train station in Prgaue, with
truly immense poster of Soviet Soldiers marching, their boots crushing down
on the station--
and the Tchaikovsky music played for hours!
i was under a guard the whole time so not allowd to go anywhere except step
out front to see the collassal soldiers--
which had lettering that read--"Our Friends The Soviet Army"
this was 1975--
in years previous, one found refugee Czech students trying to get by making
huge chalk painting repros, portraits of tourists  and drawings of all kinds
on sidewalks, esp in Paris--

Dear PEN Supporters,

Next Tuesday, September 23, at Cooper Union=E2=80=9As Great Hall, PEN will presen=
t a
program to honor Burmese writers whose work has been suppressed by the
military regime and to support the victims of the recent cyclone. Readers
will include Kiran Desai, Orhan Pamuk, Salman Rushdie, and Venerable U
Gawsita, among others. The event, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the
1988 popular uprising, as well as the first anniversary of last year=E2=80=9As
monks=E2=80=9A protests, will pay tribute to writers, journalists, monks, and all
those who continue to raise their voices, at enormous personal risk, for
greater freedom in Burma.

All proceeds from this event will be donated to the International Burmese
Monks Organization, a network of Buddhist monks collecting relief aid for
the victims of Cyclone Nargis. Tickets are $20 and are available online or
by phone: www.smarttix.com or 212-868-4444.

We would love to see you at 7 p.m. next Tuesday at this important event. Yo=
u
can find additional program details here: www.pen.org/readingburma

Thank you for your continuing support.

Warmly,
Francine Prose

To think of Rimbaud as a cartographer is in no way a stretch of the
imagination. And to think that Chirot has used one of Rimbaud's maps to
traverse his memory while simultaneously his dreams, is altogether
possible=97and it seems this is what Chirot has done.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Presenting work by poets from across Europe, the NEW EUROPEAN POETS
anthology enlisted twenty-four regional editors to select and translate 290
poets, whose writing was first published after 1970. These poets represent
every country in Europe, and many of them are published here for the first
time in English or in the United States. The resulting anthology collects
some of the very best work of a new generation of poets who have come of ag=
e
since Paul Celan, Anna Akhmatova, Federico Garcia Lorca, Eugenio Montale,
and Czeslaw Milosz.

The WRITERS WITHOUT BORDERS series is supported by Penn alumnus Seth Ginns
(C'00) and by the Office of the Provost. The series will -- in Provost
Daniels' words -- "bring together Penn's vital commitment to global
engagement with the activism and inspiration of some of the world's most
compelling writers."

MARELLA FELTRIN-MORRIS is Assistant Professor of Italian at Ithaca College,
specializing in late nineteenth-century and twentieth-century Italian
Literature and translation.

Poet, translator and essayist, MURAT NEMET-NEJAT has translated the work of
a number of modern and contemporary Turkish poets. He is currently
working on translation of work by the Turkish poet Seyhan Eroz=E7elik, whic=
h
will be published by Talisman House in 2008.

ADAM J. SORKIN has published more than thirty books of translation and
placed the work of over 150 Romanian writers in 350 periodicals and reviews
in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Poet and translator J.C. TODD, who is a visiting lecturer in Creative
Writing at Bryn Mawr, served as contributing editor for "The Drunken Boat"
from 2001-2007, editing features on Eastern European contemporary poetry in
translation: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia.

WAYNE MILLER, co-editor of the New European Poets anthology, is the author
of two books of poems, The Book of Props and Only the Senses Sleep, as well
as translator of Moikom Zeqo's I Don't Believe in Ghosts. He teaches at the
University of Central Missouri, where he co-edits Pleiades: A Journal of Ne=
w
Writing.

"Veronica Forrest-Thomson: Larking up Kicks"

A Call for Papers

"[O]ne of the misfortunes of the lack of attention being paid to
English poetry of this century is the obscurity of Veronica
Forrest-Thomson, a poet who died in 1975 at the age of 27." So stated
Brian Kim-Stefans in July 2001. In 2002, literary critic Suzanne Raitt
expressed the hope that Forrest-Thomson's unknown status would be
mitigated by a compilation of her poetry in the nineties and a recent
monograph by Alison Mark. This symposium emerges on the heels of
another updated version of Forrest-Thomson's poetry, namely Veronica
Forrest-Thomson: Collected Poems (ed. Anthony Barnett, published by
Shearsman Books and Allardyce, Barnett, 2008).

Veronica Forrest-Thomson wrote three poetry collections: _Identi-kit_
(1967) _Language Games_ (1971), and _On the Periphery_ (1976). She was
also a literary theorist and critic who authored _Poetic Artifice: A
Theory of Twentieth-Century Poetry_ (1978). Her work is witty,
philosophical, and occasionally, deliberately, badly rhymed. It is
also worthy of more consideration.

Christ's College, Cambridge and the Centre for Modernist Studies at
the University of Sussex intend to co-host a day-long symposium
dedicated to the work of Veronica Forrest-Thomson. It will be held on
Saturday, January 17th, 2008 at Cambridge, and will involve panels
comprised of 15-minute papers and a longer, seminar-style finale of
very short close readings of individual Forrest-Thomson poems. Our
intent is to foster an informed and comfortable dialogue about
Forrest-Thomson, and contemplate ways of approaching her work.

As such, we welcome papers on any facet of Forrest-Thomson's poetry
and criticism. Proposals of no more than 250 words should be sent to
both Sara Crangle (S.Crangle@sussex.ac.uk) and Sophie Read
(scnr2@cam.ac.uk).

Subject:      HAIR vs. Living Theater
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The Living Theater vs.
HAIR.
Improbable comparisons? Not really. First I want to say that the benefit
for
the Living Theater at Joes Pub,Revolutionary Acts, was a sold out
affair.
All the performers were basically cabaret and musical folk and though
some carried
anarchistic messages in their somewhat funny and theatrical performances
their styles
as with the style of HAIR were completely antithetical to what the Living
Theater stands for,
though it ended with Judith Malina reading some of her poetry. But its
the similarities
between Hair and the Living Theater that I want to deal with, the spirit
of counter culture
rebellion and the messages that both HAIR and the Living Theater have to
offer us.
     Though the one (L.T.) is intellectual, high art and the other (HAIR)
almost an anti-intellectual,
popular musical  ( fundamental difference being the use of song as
vehicle),
they both gives us ensemble players that offer up an anarchistic, pro
sex, pro drug,
anti-war palette with other parallels such as nudity, group sex and the
pitfalls of so called
democratic (actually oligarchic),organized if somewhat fascistic
government.
The authors of HAIR, like the principals of the Living Theater, come from
the
experimental roots of theatre. In HAIR one can see/feel parallel moments
to such
Living Theater productions as Mysteries and Paradise Now. Also throughout
HAIR, as with most Living Theater productions the audience is constantly
being engaged.
Though both are concerned with the way folks react to the material
presented
and how that material relates back to the audience and are both
willfully,
as with most good art that is not made for its own sake, interested in
the activity
as well as its result there is one major difference, aside from the
festive catchy pop/rock
atmosphere of HAIR. In the production of HAIR at Shakespeare in the Park
the
character who gets drafted and sent to Vietnam (the draft being one of
the
only differences between war then and now) dies and is laid out on an
American flag
toward the back of the stage. The cast immediately gathers starts singing
Let the Sun Shine In
and encourages the audience to sing and dance along. The victim is
completely upstaged, in fact
almost blotted out, forgotten. If this were a Living Theater production,
say, as with the end of
Mysteries, we would be left with that dead body to think about and not
good
hearted optimistic merriment. Yet, though many of their processes differ
many of their
approaches are the same and its very interesting to watch them unfold
and calculate where, at
certain points structure and content of both ideas become identical.
    I prefer the Living Theaters approach, though a good song and dance
never hurt anyone.
I can say however that despite its happier moments HAIR might just be the
one of most anti-war,
counter-culture plays to come along and one that finds itself wrapped up
nicely
in a perfect pop culture package and tied off neatly with a yellow
ribbon.
    This fall look for HAIR on Broadway and the new Living Theater
production of Eureka,
the late Hanon Resnikoffs adaptation of Poes epic poem.

I haven't been keeping up with the case Lori but the 1st Amendment covers=

almost all forms of expression even commercial ones (though commercial on=
es
enjoy lesser protection). Given your interests, you may be interested in =
the
fact that source code is protected as speech, even though the nature of
source code is such that it has a low (arguably) social utility but a hig=
h
functional one (ultraperformative in an Austinian sense?). See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States.

From 'The First Remainder Series'
Joseph F. Keppler
http://vispo.com/guests/keppler

This is the first of what I hope will be several projects on vispo.com
involving the work of Joe Keppler. We've been friends for twenty years.
Reading his work, for me, is full of the same sense of discovery and
excitement you feel when you talk with him. I've never met anyone else as
acute as he is when you look at art together. And that critical scope and
fresh perceptivity is part of how he greets life as well as art.

Joe publishes Poets.Painters.Composers.Critics.Sculptors.Slaves. from
Seattle. He has been publishing this poly-artistic project since the 80's.
Some issues are printed. Others are in sound, sculpture, posters, and other
media. The visual poems published on vispo.com are by Joe from a 2007 issue
called "the first remainder series" which also included work by fifteen
other artists. Of the series, Joe says:

   "In the spirit of St. Vincent de Paul’s, Goodwill’s, and
   Salvation Army’s thrift-store poetics and aesthetics,
   Poets.Painters. Composers.Critics. Sculptors.Slaves.
   announces its first remainder series.

   The basic idea is to use up our remainder of paper stock
   for small editions of poetry and art. The paper stock for
   our first remainder series is in various weights and colors
   though all of it is letter size (8.5” x 11”, 216mm x 279mm).
   Printed work will be issued in numbered editions of 25 or
   less, 40% of which goes to the poet or artist. While they
   last, these ordinary prints will be available for $6 a copy,
   which doesn’t include postage and handling, or $7, which does,
   payable to Poets.Painters. Composers.Critics.Sculptors.Slaves.
   10254 35th Avenue SW, Seattle, WA 98146 USA. Of course the
   artist is free to sign and price his or her portion differently.

   Another of the project’s reasons for being has been to catch
   the differences between print and electronic media, and a
   working title for the project could have been, to paraphrase
   an important Walter Benjamin title, “The Work of Reproduction
   in an Age of Technological Art.”

   Most of the electronic, pdf versions of the First Remainder
   Series are extant and available via email. Some actual,
   numbered prints are still obtainable from the artists or from
   Seattle’s Wessel & Lieberman Books."

Of his own work in this series, Joe says:

   "We fold. That is, we crease. We crease & increase, six new
   folds for ppccss's first remainder series. Differences
   among arts and technologies make actual creases in the
   print editions and simulated creases in the pdf files.
   In either case folding, a philosophical, sculptural,
   genetic, and poker activity, unfolds a metaphoric,
   heterogeneous poetics. Also, here's an assembly simply
   entitled, "ODE." It consists of four corner brackets
   pasted to a stiff sheet with a small “o” printed on it.
   The numbered print edition has metal brackets and the
   pdf simulated brackets."

The 'folding' dimension of these pieces is typically interesting and
humorous. The first remainder series with lots of folding. Which you'd like
in a remainder series, surely. The whole thing is folding in a poetics of
(graceful) collapse. That may rise with folding of a different sort.

But you don't need to know the fold motif to appreciate this little suite.
COUPLET, for instance: a couplet is a pair of lines; Joe has them
intersecting. Very simple. A totally minimal visual poem that relates the
lterary and the visual. It's so visually simple it's startling.

TERZA RIMA alludes to a verse form where the stanza is three lines long and
the first and third lines rhyme. And the second line rhymes with the first
and third of the next terza rima stanza. Here again we have a visual
correlative of a literary form. In Joe's piece, the first and third line are
the same; and all three lines have shading that can either look bookish or
be of shades of rhyme, those fields of linguistic energy.

Joe's work does not acquiesce to the typical page. It's different and
unexpected. Fresh. Probing. Literary, visual, and spatial at once.

I only lurk on this list for the most part, but regardless of whether you
can attend the event, I would highly recommend *New European Poets*, which =
I
have now read twice and has given me the mental space to write a couple of
poems I would not have otherwise considered.

WRITERS WITHOUT BORDERS:
NEW EUROPEAN POETS

featuring translator-editors
MARELLA FELTRIN-MORRIS (Italian)
MURAT NEMET-NEJAT (Turkish)
ADAM J. SORKIN (Romanian)

The Writers House | 3805 Locust Walk
This event is free & open to the public - no registration required!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Presenting work by poets from across Europe, the NEW EUROPEAN POETS
anthology enlisted twenty-four regional editors to select and translate 290
poets, whose writing was first published after 1970. These poets represent
every country in Europe, and many of them are published here for the first
time in English or in the United States. The resulting anthology collects
some of the very best work of a new generation of poets who have come of ag=
e
since Paul Celan, Anna Akhmatova, Federico Garcia Lorca, Eugenio Montale,
and Czeslaw Milosz.

The WRITERS WITHOUT BORDERS series is supported by Penn alumnus Seth Ginns
(C'00) and by the Office of the Provost. The series will -- in Provost
Daniels' words -- "bring together Penn's vital commitment to global
engagement with the activism and inspiration of some of the world's most
compelling writers."

MARELLA FELTRIN-MORRIS is Assistant Professor of Italian at Ithaca College,
specializing in late nineteenth-century and twentieth-century Italian
Literature and translation.

Poet, translator and essayist, MURAT NEMET-NEJAT has translated the work of
a number of modern and contemporary Turkish poets. He is currently
working on translation of work by the Turkish poet Seyhan Eroz=E7elik, whic=
h
will be published by Talisman House in 2008.

ADAM J. SORKIN has published more than thirty books of translation and
placed the work of over 150 Romanian writers in 350 periodicals and reviews
in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Poet and translator J.C. TODD, who is a visiting lecturer in Creative
Writing at Bryn Mawr, served as contributing editor for "The Drunken Boat"
from 2001-2007, editing features on Eastern European contemporary poetry in
translation: Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia.

WAYNE MILLER, co-editor of the New European Poets anthology, is the author
of two books of poems, The Book of Props and Only the Senses Sleep, as well
as translator of Moikom Zeqo's I Don't Believe in Ghosts. He teaches at the
University of Central Missouri, where he co-edits Pleiades: A Journal of Ne=
w
Writing.

Elizabeth Arnold, Anselm Hollo, and Tom Pickard in Milwaukee-Saturday
September 20th 7pm $8 general admission /$7 students and seniors / $6 members

Featured Reading at WOODLAND PATTERN BOOK CENTER

720 E. Locust St. Milwaukee, WI 53212
Just off highway 43

Come to this great event that will take place amongst the artwork of
Jane Dalrymple-Hollo & Anselm Hollo!

Elizabeth Arnold grew up in northeast Florida and attended Oberlin
College, the University of Chicago, and the MFA Program for Writers at
Warren Wilson College. She is the author of two books of poems,
Civilization (Flood Editions, 2006) and The Reef (University of
Chicago, 1999). She now teaches at the University of Maryland and
Warren Wilson College. She lives outside Washington, D.C.

Anselm Hollo, poet and literary translator, is a Professor in the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder,
Colorado. His most recent books are Notes on the Possibilities and
Attractions of Existence: Selected Poems 1965-2000 (Coffee House
Press) which won the San Francisco Poetry Center's Best Book Award for
2001, and Guests of Space, also from Coffee House Press 2007. Hollo's
translations from Finnish, Swedish, German and French include works by
Paavo Haavikko, Pentti Saarikoski, Gunnar Harding, Bertolt Brecht,
Blaise Cendrars and others.

Tom Pickard lives at the edge of Fiend's Fell in the North Penine
Hills on the English-Scottish border. He is the author of ten books of
poetry and prose, including The Dark Months of May (Flood Editions,
2004) and Ballad of Jamie Allan (Flood Editions, 2007). A finalist for
the National Book Critics Circle Award, Ballad of Jamie Allan was
written as a libretto for the composer John Harle and performed at the
Sage Gateshead in Durham, England (and recently released as a CD). It
concerns an eighteenth-century gypsy musician who died in Durham jail
where he was serving a life sentence for stealing a horse at the age
of seventy. His reputation as a great musician was matched by his
reputation as an outlaw, or to quote Walter Scott, "a desperate
reprobate."

   "Pickard's erotic lyrics have a terrific economy, swiftness and
obscene (and alas unquotable) directness, conjuring remembered sex,
shared blankets, beds, knives and regret."
   - Maureen McLane, Chicago Tribune

From their website:

We're thrilled to announce that in just three short days, you've
rallied together and propelled us beyond our $40,000 fundraising goal.
In fact, by the time we looked up from our computers, you'd already
donated $46,000! On top of that, you've spread the word far and wide,
and offered powerful and inspiring words of support.

This tremendous and swift outpouring has been honoring and
humbling=97particularly because you've offered it during the worst days
the U.S. economy has seen this year. Thank you. We're deeply grateful.

Please help us keep the momentum going and continue donating and offering y=
our feedback and ideas.
We know many of you have ideas and concerns about Bitch's future and
sustainability, and we're grateful for the critical feedback and ideas
you've offered so far. We're listening. And we assure you we're hard at
work on a sustainable vision, based on your feedback (and we're at work
on a survey to help facilitate this process).

We've also discovered through this process that many of you weren't
aware that Bitch is a nonprofit organization, and that we rely on your
ongoing financial support to continue our work. One of the advantages
of being a nonprofit means that the money we raise above and beyond our
fundraising goals simply goes back into the organization to secure our
future and help us launch new projects and new ways of fulfilling our
mission.

So please, if you haven't already, we ask that you consider the
value of the work we do and join this historic effort to secure the
future of a critical voice in independent media and feminism. We're in
this together.=20


Keep Winnie the wiener dog growing! Give input on our direction, and spread=
 the word!
On behalf of the staff and board here at Bitch, we offer our deepest
thanks and appreciation. We're thrilled to be demonstrating the
incredible power of community-supported publishing with you.

Area from Belladonna and Traffic & Weather from Futurepoem. Durand's other
publications include The Anatomy of Oil, Western Capital Rhapsodies, City o=
f
Ports, and Lapsus Linguae. Her poems and essays on the intersections of
poetry with ecology, architecture, and art have appeared in Conjunctions,
NYFA Current, Ecopoetics, 26, Chain, and other journals. Currently, she has
been working on a translation of Mich=C3=A8le M=C3=A9tail=E2=80=99s book-length work, Les
horizons du sol/Earth=E2=80=99s Horizons, a history of the geological formation o=
f
Marseille written within an Oulipian formal constraint. She has lived in NY=
C
more or less since she was small, with interludes in Boston, New Orleans,
Cork, Ireland, and Paris, France. She currently lives in the East Village
with her husband Richard O=E2=80=99Russa and son Ismael Toussaint Durand O=E2=80=99Russ=
a.
Toma=C5=BE =C5=A0alamun is widely recognized as one of the leading Central European
poets and has had books translated into most of the European languages. He
lives in Ljubljana, Slovenia and occasionally teaches in the USA, where he
was also a Fulbright Fellow at Columbia University, a member of
International Writing Program at Iowa and a Cultural Attach=C3=A9 at the
Consulate General of Slovenia in New York. In Spring 2008 he was appointed
as Visiting Professor in Creative Writing and Distinguished Writer in

Slovenian Academy of Science and Art. His recent books translated into
English are Poker, Blackboards, The Book For My Brother, Row and Woods and
Chalices. *This event was funded in part by Poets & Writers, Inc. through
public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.

Brendan Lorber & Gillian McCain

Rakish adventurer Brendan Lorber spends his days and nights flying small
1970=E2=80=99s-era airplanes, rebuilding a ramshackle Revolutionary War-era Brook=
lyn
farmhouse, and allowing his newborn daughter Aurora to redefine the very
nature of time and endurance. He is not the real father of several other
poet-babies born this past year despite the striking array of traits they
appear to have inherited from him, traits like immaturity, impatience, mild
colic and tiny bladders. During his recent stint as Editor of The Poetry
Project Newsletter Lorber did his best to destroy the Newsletter, the Poetr=
y
Project, all poetry forever, and you. He ran the Zinc Talk Reading Series
for ten freewheeling years. He continues to edit LUNGFULL! Magazine, the
horribly-named journal that prints people=E2=80=99s rough drafts in addition to t=
he
final versions so you can see the process from beginning to end. Lorber is
the author of several chapbooks, among them The Address Book, Dash, Your
Secret and Corvid Aurora. His work has appeared in countless journals and
anthologies in several languages around the world. He has lectured and
taught workshops on writing and participatory economics throughout the
country but always returns to his Brooklyn home slung between an old power
plant and a much older 500-acre necropolis. Gillian McCain is the author of
two books of poetry: Tilt and Religion, and is the co-author (with Legs
McNeil) of Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk (Grove
press), which has been translated into ten languages. After ten years of
being "in development" she and McNeil decided that they would rather see
Please Kill Me go back to being a tee-shirt than become a Hollywood movie.
They are currently filling t-shirt orders and working on a new oral history=
.
McCain is also collaborating with David Trinidad and Jeffery Conway on
Descent of the Dolls, a book-length poem inspired by Valley of the Dolls
(the movie) and the Inferno (the book). She is also putting together a
manuscript of poems that have been compiling for the past ten years.

I'll be bringing over some copies of my hot-off-the-press Ghost & Other =
Sonnets in the Autumn/Fall on our U.S. tour but only what I can carry =
which is very limited.   (See below for book details).  If you'd like me =
to earmark you a copy please B/C and let me know where you are so I can =
keep one for you.  You can order them from England from either Salt or =
West House (please do!) but this way you can save on P+P.

Alan Halsey and I will hopefully be seeing some of you at the following =
places from October 28th onwards...=20

The universities of Buffalo, Chicago, Miami (Ohio),
Orono (Maine).  Poetry venues in Baltimore, Washington, Boston and =
Wendell.  Full details later.=20

Here's details of the book:=20



Ghost & Other  Sonnets - =20

Take a peek if you dare:

http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/9781844714933.htm

You can order from Salt for =A310.39 or order a signed copy from me for =

Subject:      Philadelphia: a very unusual treatment of "King Lear"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello, all!

The Nonsense Company, the theater group I work with here in Madison, WI, will be one of five companies to put on what promises to be an extremely interesting version of "King Lear" in Philadelphia next weekend. Each company takes one act of the play and does what they will with it, the only stipulations being that the basic plot information is preserved and that the audience is served a dessert item by each act. The audience meets at a trolley stop, wearing red carnations, and are led to the building, where the play takes place in five different spaces. We don't know what the other groups are doing, but our take on Act III is pretty strange.

There's more information about it at http://www.puppetuprising.org
and about us at http://nonsensecompany.com.

cheers,

Andy

Here are some interesting videos with Ray Kurzweil:
http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=ray+kurzweil

He's the author of the book 'The Age of Spiritual Machines'.

On a different but related note, it's fascinating to note how we're starting
to get access over the Web to better educational video material. If you go
to and search for "Kurt Gödel" or "Paul Cohen" or "Alan Turing", for
instance, you get some really juicy videos.

Videos that provide a relatively easy entry point to material that can
occupy a life in really learning it well and more deeply. But the videos get
you over the first, often very intimidating, point of entry.

Perfect for introductory courses. Not as a replacement for the way books
handle the material. Not by a long shot. But rich and approachable videos.

And on another related note, this availability via search engines of images,
videos, sound, texts, and so on, is really tantalizing for net artists.
That's part of what my dbCinema graphic synthesizer is dealing with (

I saw the film Taxi to the Dark Side the other night.  In her great book Th=

s used since the 1950's with the development of Milton Friedman's Chicago S=
chool "Shock Doctrine" economics.  Beginning with 9/11 in Chile=2C the "Sho=
ck Doctrine" as both torture ane conoics was introduced with the idea that =
"free markets" would bring "freedom and democracy."  The opposite proved to=
 be true--increasingly repressive measures have had to be put in place in o=
rder to install this form of economics=2C including now in the USA=2C an of=
ficial practitioner of torture.

As i write in David-Baptiste Chirot: "Waterboarding & Poetry" (Wordforword =
#13 Spring 2008)=2C Francois Villon in 15th Century France is the first poe=
t of waterboarding=2C "enhanced interrogation=2C" and the scaffolds=3B i co=

ost likely Poe=2C in "The Pit and the Pendulum."
The Americans used waterboarding in the Phillipines during the Spanish-Amer=
ican War--the practice was outlawed by President "Teddy" Roosevelt when he =
took office in 1902.  Clearly=2C the country is traveling backward in time=
=2C to those halcyon pre-regulation days of which Gertrude Stein spoke so f=
ondly=2C those "robber baron" days pre-labor laws and pre TR.

In the Spring=2C Obama advocated the "right War" in Afghanistan and said he=
 was for launching unilateral attacks from within Pakistan=3B  now Bush is =
doing just this=2C in what is seen as a reprise of Vietnam and the "Secret =
War" within Cambodia.  Those were the days that made POW=2C tortured now Pr=
esidential hopeful John McCain a "hero" "fit to lead" in "today's world" as=
 it j0ourneys into the past.  Even the Cold War and Walls are springing up =
again. =20

A poetry "fraught with irony" abounds . . . Whitman's "Greatest Poem=2C" "t=
he poem of these United States" is "fast becoming a nation of lunatics" in =
which a Black man running for President supports Apartheid and a "war hero"=
 chooses as running mate a would be helicopter gunner of wolves who calls t=
he Inuit "Arctic Arabs."

I was wondering about tracing the aec from the film Taxi Driver (in which T=
ravis Bickle=2C played by De Niro=2C is a Vietnam Vet) to Taxi to the Dark =
Side . . . in Taxi Driver=2C the views from Travis' cab are of NYC as a Dan=
teesque Inferno=2C with the "false" Angel Sybil Shepard and the "Fallen" An=
gel Jodie Foster to be saved by the suicide mission of the Taxi Driver "dis=
guised" as Vet-"Mohawk."  In Taxi to the Dark Side=2C the Dark Side is Chen=
ey's vision of "down these means streets a man must go" (Raymond Chandler) =
in order to "rescue" Iraq and the Fallen Towers for the Free World=2C Democ=
racy and Free Markets.

(The man whose diaries and person Taxi Driver is loosely based on=2C Arthur=
 Bremer=2C was recently released from prison here in Wisconsin.  He had sta=
lked Nixon unsuccessfully and turned to shooting then Presidential candidat=
e George Wallace.  Bremer's Diaries were buried on a buff overlooking Lake =
Michigan where i often work on rubbeings etc.  TR's attempted assassination=
 occurred here in Milwaukee=2C when he ran as the Bull Moose Candidate in 1=
912.  Now we have a moose hunting and eating VP candidate  . . .)

In Taxi Driver=2C Travis--"I'm God's lonely man"--says--"someday a real rai=
n will come---and wash all the scum off the streets . . ." and says that so=
meone will finally have "stood up" and acted with "True Force" to bring bac=
k Health to the polluted=2C sewage-of-corruption-and-damnation-flowing stre=
ets=3B  in Taxi to the Dark Side=2C itis no longer the "Lone Assasin" who w=
ill set the World to "rights=2C" but the Health bringing scourge of Torture=
=2C "Shock and Awe=2C" the destruction of infra-structures and polluting of=
 lands=2C waters and skies.

A weird Poetry of the Apocalypse hangs about=2C a strange pall=2C and "thro=
ugh a glass=2C darkly=2C" one sees the Fall of the Berlin Wall succeeded by=
 so many new Walls that now "Wall Street" is trembling--Wall Street where t=
he first "car bomb" (a horse drawn fruit vendor's cart) was exploded (the s=
cars still visible on some buildings today) and where the latest "rescue mi=
ssion" is being undertaken to "restore Health" to a "sick" (psychotically p=
erhaps=2C cancerous=2C certainly--) System.

In Whitman's "Specimen Days=2C" so to speak=2C were Slavery=2C the Genocide=
 and installement of Indians on reservations=2C the Civl War with is concen=
tration camps in Andersonville and the North=2C the "scorched earth" tactic=
s of Sherman=2C the "real War that will never get written in the books=2C" =
an the Era of the Robber Barons. =20

How much=2C how little=2C and what--has changed is what Whitman might see a=
s the ongoing "poem of these States=2C" a Poem in which the "Angels of our =
Better Nature" battle with those forces of the "Dark Side" of one of the po=
ems excluded from Leaves of Grass=2C "Respondez."

Beneath the McCain article and quote/citation for you I've post an excerpt =
fomr "Respondez" and also one re the role of poetry and poet in such times =
from Whitman's (1871) Democratic Vistas. =20


The quote is from the Sept/Oct issue of the journal=2C as cited in Paul Kru=

ant to be seated before reading this.

Here=92s what McCain has to say about the wonders of market-based health re=
form:

Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous
nationwide competition=2C as we have done over the last decade in
banking=2C would provide more choices of innovative products less
burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.

So McCain=2C who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street=2C was praising

Two of Obama's main economics advisors, Franklin Raines and Jim Johnson (who resigned back in June due to some of this scandal being brought to light), were former CEOs of Fannie Mae. Raines was even fired from his position at Fannie Mae. And no wonder, since he overstated earnings by 50% during his tenure. Considering the situation they put their company in (and, yes, it was them as well as those in charge during the collapse who are responsible for the collapse), should anybody be taking advice from them about anything regarding the economy? I mean, they did such a bang-up job with Fannie Mae.

"Property Records Show Mr. Johnson Has Received More Than $7 Million In Loans From Countrywide Since 1998, The First Coming In The Waning Days Of His Fannie Mae Tenure" (Glenn R. Simpson and James R. Hagerty, "Countrywide Friends Got Good Loans," The Wall Street Journal, 6/7/08). Ironically, those loans seem to have been "subprime." Certainly they were loans made directly by the CEO of Countrywide. Now, does this necessarily mean something sketchy was going on? Of course not. But it seems there's a pretty tangled web involving the mortgage market, its collapse, and Obama (who also received a pretty good deal on a house, as I recall). Countrywide, by the way, has been one of the companies at the center of the mortgage market breakdown. So two of Obama's advisors were involved in creating the very mortgage crisis Obama is trying to use to his political advantage. More, they made millions off of running Fannie Mae into the ground, and have used that money
 to try to get Obama elected.

Did I mention that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were major donors to ACORN, who is currently engaged in voter fraud in Michigan and Ohio (odd how voter fraud is constantly associated with them), and that Obama worked for ACORN? I did? Seems like an interesting -- important? -- connection. But don't worry, that's just one more thing for the MSM to ignore.

John McCain -  Contingencies (Magazine) Date?

Priceless Obama campaign discovery - shear poetry of a double-edged sort.  Only major complication is that Obama is going to have to inherit this mess! It must be now a foregone conclusion that George Bush is the most catastrophic President of this country, ever! Sarah Palin =  the ultimate footnote to the whole debacle.

As to the site of 'real' poetry in the middle of this disaster??
Well, of the most recent moment,  Anselm Berrigan read at the Small Press Traffic last night here in San Francisco - that was full of two bladed lines that cut to the collapsing core. & not without the relief of some bitter-sweet humor. Thank you, Anselm!

 *Threat to Democracy in Latin America*

 *By Harold Pinter, John Pilger, Tony Benn*

 We are appalled by the failure of much of the international media to
provide accurate and proportionate coverage of these events. All democrats
throughout should rally to defend democracy in Latin America.

Need help with picture interpretation.


The following images are from a Machzor for Passover, published in 1929 in
Vilna, Poland; as you know, the fate of the Jewish community there was
disasterous, just a few years later. The book is published by Rozenkranz i
Szryftzecer and contains several pages in the beginning which may or may
not have been added to the original - they seem insertions done at the
time of the printing and binding but I'm not sure. (In fact the volume is
an odd compilation of sorts; the Haggadah per se is only a small part of
it.) There's a picture, which is reproduced below. It's a terrifying image
of a seder (the Hebrew title is HaSeder), a premonition of things to come.
It may be a contemporary image of a pogrom, an odd image of violence for a
holiday of joy and salvation (which 'salve' perhaps refers to - but then
there are armed men coming in - in fact, what _does_ salve mean in this
context?). I found this along with a collection of other Vilna books at
Sam Weller's store in Salt Lake City. Any suggestions or information you
might have about the image would be greatly appreciated. And thanks in
advance -

Hi Alan -

Could the image be a reminder of the Spanish Inquisition - the hooded
figures and the Renaissance garb of some of the seder guests -  the hooded
figures are another plague - or a symbolic of events of the first passover.

Sad and mysterious illustration.

Dear Readers,

The following is offered in response to the truthiness of Troy Camplin.

"Economic experts say that [Phil "Nation of Whiners" "Mental
Recession" "Enron Loophole"] Gramm and others are to blame for the
current crisis that is shaking Wall Street. Gramm's successful effort
to pass banking reform laws in 1999, which reduced decades-old
regulations separating banking, insurance and brokerage activities,
helped to create the current economic crisis." ("Who's Whining Now?
Gramm Slammed By Economists")
<http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5835269>

See also this extensive rap sheet on McCain's other economic policy advisors:
<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/09/15/mccain-econ-team/>

"The [Obama] campaign puts out a statement from former Fannie Mae
chief Franklin Raines, disowning ties to Obama, after a McCain ad
attacked him for the ties. The Washington Post reported -- with the
kind of blind sourcing that suggests the source was Raines -- that
Raines had "taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign
seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters." Raines
said in the statement through the campaign, "I am not an advisor to
Barack Obama, nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing
or economic matters."" (Obama denies Raines ties, accuses McCain of
throwing stones from his "seven glass houses")
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Obama_denies_Raines_ties_accuses_McCain_of_throwing_stones_from_his_seven_glass_houses.html?showall>

The false voter registrations by ACORN staffers have been limited to
the last 4 years of that organization's 38-year history -- a long
history of the kind of community organizing work (like advocating for
a living wage, fighting predaory lending practices, housing and school
reform) that Giuliani, Palin and the RNC openly mock and belittle.

"Mr. Obama worked for the Association of Community Organizations for
Reform Now's Project Vote voter-registration campaign in 1992 after
graduating from Harvard Law School. He directed a successful
voter-registration campaign, credited with electing Carol
Moseley-Braun to the U.S. Senate. Primarily targeting
African-Americans, Mr. Obama's efforts added an estimated 125,000
voters to the rolls."
<http://www.thebulletin.us/site/index.cfm?newsid=20128338&BRD=2737&PAG=461&dept_id=576361&rfi=8>

Obama's work for ACORN ended long before any allegations of voter
fraud. This is more guilt-by-association of the  Wright-Ayers variety.

Regards,
Tom Orange

>
> Two of Obama's main economics advisors, Franklin Raines and Jim Johnson (who resigned back in June due to some of this scandal being brought to light), were former CEOs of Fannie Mae. Raines was even fired from his position at Fannie Mae. And no wonder, since he overstated earnings by 50% during his tenure. Considering the situation they put their company in (and, yes, it was them as well as those in charge during the collapse who are responsible for the collapse), should anybody be taking advice from them about anything regarding the economy? I mean, they did such a bang-up job with Fannie Mae.
>
> "Property Records Show Mr. Johnson Has Received More Than $7 Million In Loans From Countrywide Since 1998, The First Coming In The Waning Days Of His Fannie Mae Tenure" (Glenn R. Simpson and James R. Hagerty, "Countrywide Friends Got Good Loans," The Wall Street Journal, 6/7/08). Ironically, those loans seem to have been "subprime." Certainly they were loans made directly by the CEO of Countrywide. Now, does this necessarily mean something sketchy was going on? Of course not. But it seems there's a pretty tangled web involving the mortgage market, its collapse, and Obama (who also received a pretty good deal on a house, as I recall). Countrywide, by the way, has been one of the companies at the center of the mortgage market breakdown. So two of Obama's advisors were involved in creating the very mortgage crisis Obama is trying to use to his political advantage. More, they made millions off of running Fannie Mae into the ground, and have used that money
>  to try to get Obama elected.
>
> Did I mention that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were major donors to ACORN, who is currently engaged in voter fraud in Michigan and Ohio (odd how voter fraud is constantly associated with them), and that Obama worked for ACORN? I did? Seems like an interesting -- important? -- connection. But don't worry, that's just one more thing for the MSM to ignore.

Sounds like your re-stating the major Republican talking points from the MSM. Why not add to them-- the fact that Franklin Raines has released a statement claiming he in no capacity  was ever an OBAMA advisor-- never the less one whom he will seek economic advice from. The people to connect to OBAMA are his ACTUAL advisors: Robert Rubins, Paul Volcker and Lawrence Summers, all Ex-Clinton advisors. So if you like the 5.7 trillion dollar surplus that they left VS the trickle down hoax of the far right one might want to look beyond the FOX NEWS MSM talking points. Certainly if yuo'd like our libraries sensored maybe the whole faux connection between Franklin Raines might be appealing or the Jim Johnson connection might be even more appealing but tell the whole truth... He was fired as soon as his position became known.

Its strange to have to mention here but, uh... the poets are generally banished from conservative societies.

What economic experts? Those on the Left, no doubt. I love how vague these news reporters get. Just find some people who agree with your ideology and only report what they say. Also, the Raines information is at best an example of Obama throwing another one of his close circle under the bus yet again. He should feel right at home with Rev. Wright and Bill Ayers.

I'm no fan of McCain, either, who I think is going to do little better on the economy than Obama. He's busy blaming all the same people as Obama and ignoring the fact that this mess was created a long time ago by "deregulations" that could not have been designed any better to fail, and thus justify nationalization.

I'm not sure who is the bigger idiot when it comes to the economy. McCain? "right now we are the victim of greed, excess and corruption in Wall Street." No, we are the victim of government regulations that allow companies to profit from their good decisions, but find themselves in no danger if they make bad decisions, as the government is there, promising to bail them out. Profits have been privatized, but losses remain in the public sector. Is it any wonder our financial institutions are collapsing? What kind of decisions would you make if you knew all your bad decisions would have no consequences for you, but that if what you wanted to do worked out, you got to keep the profits? I bet you would be willing to do all sorts of risky things -- or downright idiotic ones. And then there is Joe Biden saying what all this means is that we need more regulations. The same group of people who couldn't figure out how to "privatize" companies like Fannie Mae and
 Freddie Mac without creating a situation where they would certainly collapse want to regulate companies even more. The lesson here is not that we need more government, but that the involvement of government in these companies that have been collapsing is what caused the collapse. Government control in the economy in the U.S. was about 30 years behind that of the Soviet Union. It looks like our collapse is right on time.

$700 billion dollars. That's how much our government is going to spend on bailing out a bunch of companies run by incompetents and who were in large pert put in this position because of the regulations currently on the books. What the financial sector of the market needs is deregulation, not more regulations. They need to have failure privatized. Meaning, companies need to know that they will be allowed to fail. And the government needs to let them fail. The situation we're in now, the government has only postponed the inevitable. And, worse, like a fault line prone to earthquakes, the longer we put things off, the worse the quake is going to be.

The federal government doesn't have almost a trillion dollars to spend. It does not have $700,000,000,000. So where will it get the money? It will borrow it. That's another $700 billion added to the debt. How will it pay off this debt, which will come due some day?

1) taxes -- which will take more money out of the economy and create a worse economy overall
2) print money -- which will result in massive inflation
3) default -- considering how much of our debt countries like China own, this is the last thing we want to do. Can you imagine defaulting on a trillion dollars to China? We would be at war with China -- and they would be in the right.

Some wonderful choices given to us from the ghosts of socialism past. The interventionist state does not work. Socialism doesn't work. Centralized financial planning works no better than overall economic planning does. I hope -- but doubt -- someone will get the message and get the government out of the economy. I expect instead that we will get even more regulations out of this. When the collapse does finally happen, it will be the Great Depression II -- only in an even more globalized economy. But don't worry -- Obama plans to hurry things along by raising taxes and imposing tariffs. That worked so well during The Great Depression. It didn't make things worse or lead to WWII at all. Please ignore history. Nothing to see here.

Dear Readers,

The following is offered in response to the truthiness of Troy Camplin.

"Economic experts say that [Phil "Nation of Whiners" "Mental
Recession" "Enron Loophole"] Gramm and others are to blame for the
current crisis that is shaking Wall Street. Gramm's successful effort
to pass banking reform laws in 1999, which reduced decades-old
regulations separating banking, insurance and brokerage activities,
helped to create the current economic crisis." ("Who's Whining Now?

See also this extensive rap sheet on McCain's other economic policy advisors:
<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/09/15/mccain-econ-team/>

"The [Obama] campaign puts out a statement from former Fannie Mae
chief Franklin Raines, disowning ties to Obama, after a McCain ad
attacked him for the ties. The Washington Post reported -- with the
kind of blind sourcing that suggests the source was Raines -- that
Raines had "taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign
seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters." Raines
said in the statement through the campaign, "I am not an advisor to
Barack Obama, nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing
or economic matters."" (Obama denies Raines ties, accuses McCain of
throwing stones from his "seven glass houses")
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Obama_denies_Raines_ties_accuses_McCain_of_throwing_stones_from_his_seven_glass_houses.html?showall>

The false voter registrations by ACORN staffers have been limited to
the last 4 years of that organization's 38-year history -- a long
history of the kind of community organizing work (like advocating for
a living wage, fighting predaory lending practices, housing and school
reform) that Giuliani, Palin and the RNC openly mock and belittle.

"Mr. Obama worked for the Association of Community Organizations for
Reform Now's Project Vote voter-registration campaign in 1992 after
graduating from Harvard Law School. He directed a successful
voter-registration campaign, credited with electing Carol
Moseley-Braun to the U.S. Senate. Primarily targeting
African-Americans, Mr. Obama's efforts added an estimated 125,000
voters to the rolls."
<http://www.thebulletin.us/site/index.cfm?newsid=20128338&BRD=2737&PAG=461&dept_id=576361&rfi=8>

Obama's work for ACORN ended long before any allegations of voter
fraud. This is more guilt-by-association of the  Wright-Ayers variety.

Tom Orange

I would take issue with the statement that "poets are generally banned from=
 conservative societies."  Poets are just as likely to be banned from "prog=
ressive societies=3B"  it is not whether a State is "conservative" or "prog=
ressive" that determines the banning=2C but whether or not the poet is=2C a=
nd how strongly the poet is=2C opposed to the State.  A strongly Anarchist =
poet=2C for example=2C would be one quite possibly banned by either and/or =
both States=2C simply by being opposed to The State.=20

Somone related to someone in the State bureaucracy simply might not like th=
e poet for some obscure reason--and so--boom!--out they go!--banned with al=
 their manuscripts--politics can be "very personal" after all=2C and have n=
othing to do with "right" or left" other than which of the poet's hand's be=
ing the writing hand is the one that gets cut off.=20

For example=2C consider the poetic alliance which Drs Marjorie Perloff and =
Charles Bernstein have begun with academics of poetry programs in China=2C =
following a symposiumon re Language Poetry in China.  As is well known=2C C=
hina bans manys of its "progressive" poets=2C and many are driven into exil=
e in the West.  The Chinese have also suppressed the culture of the Tibetan=
 people=2C as well as expressions of a spiritual nature by Chinese citizens=
.  This "problematizes" the issue of labeling as "conservative"/"progressiv=
e" both States and poetry Schools/"Movements"  in relation with the issue o=
f "banning poets" and poetries.

The same can be said in a way with this issue of the advisors--in a sense=
=2C all of them are=2C including al the candidates=2C already part of the s=
ystem which has led to this immense disaster=2C because none of them have d=
one anything to avert what has been visible for years now as a down bound t=
rain wreck of collasal proportions.  And why not?  Perhaps because everyone=
 has cynically bet on just what is happening--that the Government=2C that h=
ated and reviled Enemy of the Free Market=2C will step in finally and rescu=
e the privatized world with public funds raised off the backs of--yes--the =
labor of those citizens who actually pay taxes=2C as compared to the two th=
irds of the corporations who do not. =20

Increasingly=2C economic and foreign policy have nothing at all to do with =
"advisors=2C" or perhaps even "Presidents=2C" but ever more to do with the =
lobbyists and corporations and their associates who run the actual show.  O=
ne of the head honchos of the McCain campaign is a top lobbyist for the cou=
ntry of Georgia=2C whose President went to Columbia University=2C and who b=
anned the Free Press and fired on demonstrators in his "democracy."  The US=
 just gave a billion buckaroos to this "goodl old boy" quicker than you can=
 say "Nuke them Rooskies."  Even though it's illegal=2C you can get a big o=
le tax break for sending money to the illegal Israeli "settlements=2C" whic=
h have=2C not suprisingly=2C doubled in size since the promise last Novembe=
r at Annaopolis  by the Israeli government  to halt further construction.  =
Under such circumstances=2C it's easy to see why tryiong to create a "compr=
ehensive" economic and foreign policy" that can possible be held "accountab=
le" by anonyone to anything or anyone is next toi impossible.=20

 Remember the huge outcry when Dubai had tried to purchase the Security Ope=
rations of US Ports?  My God!  Can't have any of those Arabs protecting our=
 ports!  (Which to this day=2C as is constantly pointed out=2C are still pr=
actically unprotected from the simplest of Terrorist Attacks.) Oh no--some =
American companies were destined for this task.  But guess where Vice-Presi=
dent Cheney's old pals at Haliburton have relocated their World head quarte=
rs to from Texas? Why=2C  Dubai=2C of course.  Turns out it's just much saf=
er there.=20

On Democracy Now this morning I heard that some American Troops are being "=
sent home"--not however to "go home=2C" but to be "redeployed" as "security=
 forces" within the USA.  Yes--Armed Forces who are now being put at the re=
ady to "manage" any "domestic incidents. "  The  Armed Forces will be facin=
g down American civilians=2C as well as al those "illegal aliens" and "enem=
y combattants" among the "detinees" held within the borders of the USA. =20
The Programs which were last used during World War Two in which local citiz=

rson any where in the world an enemy comabttant or person of interest and h=

The one "saving grace" for the American economy has been that Arms sales in=
 the last few years have risen at rates that are beyond belief.  It has got=
ten to the point in the last several years that Congress has openly authori=
zed sales that are illegal under US Law--without hardly any outcry at all f=
rom their fellow members or the press. =20

The US has begun a major buildup of Special Forces in Colombia=2C as well a=
s more covert ones in Bolivia and Paraguay. Special Ops are being deployed =
agin to old stations that had been abondoned in the Far East and South East=

How many millions of cluster bombs=2C bombers and missiles to pay off Fanny=
 Mae's bakruptcy for example?--

Instead of paying others for worthless detainees housed for ever at US expe=

How many subprimes might be resuced for the hide of a Sarkozy do you think?=

How much would al that heroin the US could control in Afghanistan be worth?

Think about it!  Be resourceful!!  Who'd like to buy Mount Rushmore?  It's =
only a bunch of carved rocks after all!  Want to buy the Alamo?  How about =

She drops the big white bullet palm to palm
to palm like stepping down on swinging stairs=20
to the top of Big Rock Candy Mountain,=20

trees and there's always ice and whiskey too.=20
Her mouth's blistered from chemo and she's full

of holes as she goes where hydrocodone
grows in the acetaminophen shoals.
She laughs when I write our hearts make morphine.=20
She writes you're three hours away happy in a book,

floating in a tub.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:


Aaron Shurin & Anne Waldman
with Ambrose Bye


Friday, September 26th   7:30 p.m.
Timken Lecture Hall
Refreshments will be served

Join us!


Aaron Shurin's new book is King of Shadows, a collection
of narrative essays, just out from City Lights. Other books
include Involuntary Lyrics (Omnidawn, 2005), A Door (Talisman
House, 2000) and The Paradise of Forms: Selected Poems
(Talisman House, 1999). His honors include National Endowment,
California Arts Council, and San Francisco Arts Commission
literary fellowships. A longtime Bay Area educator, he directs
and teaches in the MFA Writing Program at the University of
San Francisco.

Anne Waldman is an internationally celebrated poet, performer,
professor, editor and cultural/political activist and the author, most
recently of Red Noir (Farfalla, McMillen & Parrish), In the Room
of Never Grieve (Coffee House Press), Structure of the World
Compared To A Bubble (Penguin Poets), and Outrider (La Alameda
Press). She also co-edited The Angel Hair Anthology and Civil
Disobediences: Poetics and Politics in Action. She founded (with
Allen Ginsberg and Diane diPrima) the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa University in Boulder, the first
Buddhist-inspired school in the western hemisphere. Her CDs
include Battery: Live at Naropa and The Eye of The Falcon (with
Ambrose Bye) and Matching Half (with Ambrose Bye & Akilah Oliver).
She has participated in festivals in Berlin, Wuhan, (China), and
Mumbai in the past year. Forthcoming: Humanity/Manatee, and
the complete Iovis trilogy.

Ambrose Bye, musician (keyboard, guitar, voice) and composer, son
of poets Anne Waldman and Reed Bye, grew up in the environment
of The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa
University, counting Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs as
"poetic" godfathers. He graduated from The University of California,
Santa Cruz and has studied at the music/production program at the
Pyramind Institute in San Francisco. He has performed on stage with
Anne Waldman and Bob Holman in New York's Issue Project Room
in a program that included Steve Buscemi reading form the work of
William Burroughs and accompanied Anne Waldman at The Boulder
Theatre's "Music and Poetry for Progressives" headlined by Thurston
Moore of Sonic Youth, and Jello Biafra. He is working on new project
which includes the poet Amiri Baraka.

At SPT, Anne Waldman and Ambrose Bye will perform selections of
Matching Half, their exciting 2008 CD with poet-performer Akilah Oliver,
which mixes poetry and experimental music. These original compositions
& soundscapes bring a new dynamic to "spoken word."



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
There's no better time to join SPT!
Check out: http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm

DU=0ASent: Monday, 22 September, 2008 10:12:00 PM=0ASubject: Re: Political =
Poetry=0A=0AI would take issue with the statement that "poets are generally=
 banned from conservative societies."=C2=A0 Poets are just as likely to be =
banned from "progressive societies;"=C2=A0 it is not whether a State is "co=
nservative" or "progressive" that determines the banning, but whether or no=
t the poet is, and how strongly the poet is, opposed to the State.=C2=A0 A =
strongly Anarchist poet, for example, would be one quite possibly banned by=
 either and/or both States, simply by being opposed to The State. =0A=0ASom=
one related to someone in the State bureaucracy simply might not like the p=
oet for some obscure reason--and so--boom!--out they go!--banned with al th=
eir manuscripts--politics can be "very personal" after all, and have nothin=
g to do with "right" or left" other than which of the poet's hand's being t=
he writing hand is the one that gets cut off. =0A=0AFor example, consider t=
he poetic alliance which Drs Marjorie Perloff and Charles Bernstein have be=
gun with academics of poetry programs in China, following a symposiumon re =
Language Poetry in China.=C2=A0 As is well known, China bans manys of its "=
progressive" poets, and many are driven into exile in the West.=C2=A0 The C=
hinese have also suppressed the culture of the Tibetan people, as well as e=
xpressions of a spiritual nature by Chinese citizens.=C2=A0 This "problemat=
izes" the issue of labeling as "conservative"/"progressive" both States and=
 poetry Schools/"Movements"=C2=A0 in relation with the issue of "banning po=
ets" and poetries.=0A=0AThe same can be said in a way with this issue of th=
e advisors--in a sense, all of them are, including al the candidates, alrea=
dy part of the system which has led to this immense disaster, because none =
of them have done anything to avert what has been visible for years now as =
a down bound train wreck of collasal proportions.=C2=A0 And why not?=C2=A0 =
Perhaps because everyone has cynically bet on just what is happening--that =
the Government, that hated and reviled Enemy of the Free Market, will step =
in finally and rescue the privatized world with public funds raised off the=
 backs of--yes--the labor of those citizens who actually pay taxes, as comp=
ared to the two thirds of the corporations who do not.=C2=A0 =0A=0AIncreasi=
ngly, economic and foreign policy have nothing at all to do with "advisors,=
" or perhaps even "Presidents," but ever more to do with the lobbyists and =
corporations and their associates who run the actual show.=C2=A0 One of the=
 head honchos of the McCain campaign is a top lobbyist for the country of G=
eorgia, whose President went to Columbia University, and who banned the Fre=
e Press and fired on demonstrators in his "democracy."=C2=A0 The US just ga=
ve a billion buckaroos to this "goodl old boy" quicker than you can say "Nu=
ke them Rooskies."=C2=A0 Even though it's illegal, you can get a big ole ta=
x break for sending money to the illegal Israeli "settlements," which have,=
 not suprisingly, doubled in size since the promise last November at Annaop=
olis=C2=A0 by the Israeli government=C2=A0 to halt further construction.=C2=
=A0 Under such circumstances, it's easy to see why tryiong to create a "com=
prehensive" economic and foreign policy" that can possible be held "account=
able" by
 anonyone to anything or anyone is next toi impossible. =0A=0ARemember the =
huge outcry when Dubai had tried to purchase the Security Operations of US =
Ports?=C2=A0 My God!=C2=A0 Can't have any of those Arabs protecting our por=
ts!=C2=A0 (Which to this day, as is constantly pointed out, are still pract=
ically unprotected from the simplest of Terrorist Attacks.) Oh no--some Ame=
rican companies were destined for this task.=C2=A0 But guess where Vice-Pre=
sident Cheney's old pals at Haliburton have relocated their World head quar=
ters to from Texas? Why,=C2=A0 Dubai, of course.=C2=A0 Turns out it's just =
much safer there. =0A=0AOn Democracy Now this morning I heard that some Ame=
rican Troops are being "sent home"--not however to "go home," but to be "re=
deployed" as "security forces" within the USA.=C2=A0 Yes--Armed Forces who =
are now being put at the ready to "manage" any "domestic incidents. "=C2=A0=
 The=C2=A0 Armed Forces will be facing down American civilians, as well as =
al those "illegal aliens" and "enemy combattants" among the "detinees" held=
 within the borders of the USA.=C2=A0 =0AThe Programs which were last used =
during World War Two in which local citizenry, police, fire workers, medica=
l personel were mobilized and trained as "under cover" agents, to surveil a=
nd collect information on the populace and report on any "suspicious person=
s and developments" are being reinstituted.=C2=A0 The powers of the Office =
of the president have been extended to the point of a God like Omniscience-=
-the President now can proclaim any person any where in the world an enemy =
comabttant or person of interest and have them detaineed indefinetly.=C2=A0=
 =0A=0AThe one "saving grace" for the American economy has been that Arms s=
ales in the last few years have risen at rates that are beyond belief.=C2=
=A0 It has gotten to the point in the last several years that Congress has =
openly authorized sales that are illegal under US Law--without hardly any o=
utcry at all from their fellow members or the press.=C2=A0 =0A=0AThe US has=
 begun a major buildup of Special Forces in Colombia, as well as more cover=
t ones in Bolivia and Paraguay. Special Ops are being deployed agin to old =
stations that had been abondoned in the Far East and South East Asia, as we=
ll as the Phillipines and Malayasia, Indonesia.=C2=A0 Missiles deployed in =
Eastern Europe, the immesnse Naval blockade building in the Gulf area--and =
for the first time ever, American forces stationed in israel, if only so fa=
r for now as technicians aiding with the installment and management of new =
radar systems.=C2=A0 =0A=0AThe "right War" being launched INTO Afghanistan =
FROM within Pakistan--evidence that the "Surge" was in actuality an ethnic =
cleansing of Sunni neighborhoods--the potential attack on Iran--Palestine, =
Lebanon, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Congo, Darfur, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, South=
 Africa--Nigeria--Algeria--=0A=0AAnd all those arms being shipped out!=0A=
=0AWill any of them be used to pay for the bail outs?--!!!--??=0A=0AHow man=
y millions of cluster bombs, bombers and missiles to pay off Fanny Mae's ba=
kruptcy for example?--=0A=0AInstead of paying others for worthless detainee=
s housed for ever at US expense in Gitmo--why not just start some serious k=
indapping for ransom of World Leaders to be held in these high tech hell ho=
les?--=0A=0AHow many subprimes might be resuced for the hide of a Sarkozy d=
o you think?=C2=A0 Or him and his wife considered as buy one get one for fi=
fty per cent off deal?=C2=A0 Hey?--How much for the two Birtish Prinbces?=
=C2=A0 For Putin?--For the Chinese Foriegn Minister?=C2=A0 The Head of Univ=

Alan,
I forwarded your request to my knowledgeable friend Maxine Levy who
offers this interpretation of the pictures:
She writes:
"Just some first thoughts.
It says it is a Haggadah from Vilna, however, it appears to picture a
seder being interrupted by priests from the Inquisition.  Maybe there
were some Sephardic Jews in Vilna who wanted to remember the
expulsion of their ancestors???  The picture seems to include Eliyahu
Hanovee passing over the seder in his chariot.  Maybe they are trying
to depict the suffering of the Jews as a sign that the arrival of the
Messiah will come soon to save them."
Have you received any more answers?
Alan, have a sweet new year (b/c if you'd like my poem "Psalm for
Rosh Hashonah" which is in my new collection  ROCK  VEIN  SKY).

I was there last week,
and found the display of available books to the right
of the door on entering. I bought two desirable ones and another at
the counter.
The people there didn't seem all that strange,
though they weren't effusive.

NOTE: THE DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH IS CO-SPONSORING THE ALTA CONFERENCE.
The ALTA Reception and National Translation Award Celebration on the
first day of the conference is free and open to any interested folks:
Weisman, 6:30 pm, Thursday October 16. See other details below.

Dear Colleagues,

I'd like to inform you that the 31st annual conference of ALTA, the
American Literary Translators Association, will be held at the Radisson
University Hotel on the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus on
October 15 - 18, 2008. The conference will feature panels, readings, a
book exhibit, and other events concerned with the art and craft of
literary translation. Many leading translators will be taking part-it
would be invidious to mention names, but the whole program can be found
online at:

http://www.utdallas.edu/alta/conference/schedule.html

Information on registration, in turn, can be found at:

http://www.utdallas.edu/alta/conference/conf_registration.html

I want to extend a warm invitation to all those in the academic and
literary communities in the Twin Cities who have an interest in literary
translation and world literature, to join us for this meeting.
Membership in the association is NOT necessary to attend the conference.
ALTA conferences are known for their friendly, collegial atmosphere;
experienced translators from a broad range of languages mingle easily
with novices and with scholars, publishers, and other individuals
intrigued by the fascinating problems and practices of translating
literary texts. The choice of location for the conference, in turn, was
no accident-ALTA is aware of the Twin Cities' rich and varied literary
life, and attendees from all around the country and the world are eager
to interact with the many translators, writers, researchers, publishers,
and lovers of world literature who make Minnesota their home.

I hope very much that you will be able to join us for the ALTA
conference. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact
me at: <billj@indiana.edu>.

With best wishes, and hoping to see you at the conference in October,

Bill Johnston, Indiana University
Conference Chair

Dear Barry:

Many thanks for your quotes from "Soldes" the last piece in Rimbaud's
Illuminations!!
(i believe that the order of them, at least at one point, i am not sure if
this is still true--was created by Felix Feneon--
whose great Novels in three lines came out this year from the NYRB press--)


I posted last week the announcement of Tir aux pigeons selection from my
ongoing "After Rimbaud's Illuminations"--i reposted the announcement below
and also another online address which has more of the pieces and some
related visual pieces--there are more scattered about in Otoliths and at my
blog also--
and more of a series of visual pieces that are in a sense "with" the
"after"--
i was so happy to find your quoting from Rimbaud and not only that from one
of my favorite pieces by him--that it inspired me to sit down and write on
another piece "after" the Illuminations--which has a few more lines to go
now--

After Rimbaud's Illuminations <http://www.lulu.com/content/3882597>

Download: FREE

To think of Rimbaud as a cartographer is in no way a stretch of the
imagination. And to think that Chirot has used one of Rimbaud's maps to
traverse his memory while simultaneously his dreams, is altogether
possible=97and it seems this is what Chirot has done.

   - *"After Rimbaud's Illuminations" with Visual Poems also*


*

i was inspired in reading them in french as they always seem to me i french
to be as though writing with English syntax but using french words, very
influenced by his time spent in England--which was actually longer than he
spent in Paris--so when one writes in English hearing in one's head French
that one hears as being written with English being heard in it while being
written in French--it makes for quite a number of "transits"--

not knowing one had to be a US citizen, at one point "John Rimbaud" had
applied to join the US Navy, from Germany--

Graham Robb in his superb bio of Rimbaud (made al the more amazing i think
in that Robb doesn't really like Rimbaud, yet does such deep research and
applies so much detection and thought to him--perhaps this "distance" of no=
t
liking the poet actually helped in not creating yet another of those books
which Etiemble had assembled fifty years ago under the rubric of "le Mythe
de Rimbaud"--a tome which surely needs a massive updating!--) Graham Robb
also tracks down Rimbaud's posing as an English man in order to flee the
Dutch Army he had signed on for in Java--and In England he met far more
(exiled) Communards than he had during his brief stay in Paris during the
period of the Commune--there was a huge and thriving colony of French exile=
s
of various political stripes in London for some time--along with Anarchists
and others from many other countries and regions--


this piece from today's NY Times re mark Twain's house actually alludes a
number of times to the present crisis, as it is not simply the house which
is being fought for in terms of survival, but a whole accompanying much mor=
e
heavily invested in, expensive and probably in a way kind of useless
"tourist trap" Center and museum complex--far more demanding to be sure in
terms of cash and number of visitors than the old twain mansion ever was--

again, a case of totally unnecessary borrowing, spending, building,
investing, fundraising and al the frantic rush and fuss associated with one
crisis following on another--and --boy!  what a rip off, too!--to read that
one does not see Mark Twain's REAL WRITING DESK but a REPLICA!!--

"build it and they will come"--but apparently not to this place!--as the
article shows, a far less than anticipated attendance at this "complex has
made it far less of an investment than it had been sold as--much like al th=
e
rest of the "can't miss projects" that have been being sold on the Free
Market like the ear wax balls some truly brazen dope dealers pass off as
rocks of crack cocaine--

in the last year what a sad parade of writers' houses in trouble!--Poe's
house formerly on the outskirts of NYC, Edith Wharton's house in MA, and
this mockery of what had been a mockery for many in its own day of what man=
y
felt was the actual Twain they knew--and perhaps why he could never really
write in it--

why do places need al these extra centers and complexes light shows multi
screen tours of the faked up non reality reality show versions of writer's
lives--other than to generate cash out of a veneration for--what?--
for the dollar--which they see as the crowning glory of some of these
writers--they are "still today big sellers"--
though Poe was not protected by copyright, there being none in those
days--and so though producing a massive hit song a mega platinum hit so to
speak, with "The Raven"--he only saw a few dollars for it--
still, this desire to turn everything into a theme park--
as Poe foresaw in "Morning on the Wisahicon" with its eerie and uncannily
disturbing simulation of an "American" "wildenress"--
after all, when the writer lived there, it didn't look like a literary
version of Disneyland--

and some writers who made enough money to buy a lot of bric-a-brac for thei=
r
fancier places as they rose through the ranks--had terrible taste!--so at
least provide one with a kind of museum of the more awful aspects of the
culture of the nouveau riche--an anarkeyological vision of quick cash
converted into "instant classics" which turned into "unplanned obsolete"
objects--along with many an "eternal and classical verite" that turned out
to be as hollow as a drinking man's wooden leg--

Balzac, for example, who wrote what Karl Marx felt to be the magnum opus an=
d
dissection no pareil of Capitalism, La Comedie humaine--could write such
incredible intricate and beautiful descriptions, that he sold himself on
purchasing the worst crap in the world--simply by seeing it through his
pen's eye as it were, rather than with the pair in his head--

or Zola--who wrote that novel of painters which drove his ever after former
lifelong closest  friend Cezanne to despair, L'Oeuvre, --yet another feng
shui pusher about of the worst heaps of late 19th Century  objects no longe=
r
even dimly remembered----like Meisonnier--the most famous and highest price=
d
painter of the latter 19th century who was not even mentioned in a two
volume history of French painting 40 years later--

or his equivalent in poetry--the Englishman Martin Tupper, who just missed
being named Poet Laureate (narrowly passed over for Tennyson) and who was
for a  while was the best selling English poet of al time, and the first to
make over a million US dollars--and forgotten before he died, all his works
out of print, penniless, due to bad investments, which he had a gift for,
just like Twain and Balzac (the great artist of Capital in life was a fool
with it), and Dostoevsky, the gambler--

one wonders if the makers of these "complexes" couldn't have learned from
the actual histories of the lives of the writers whom they propose to
"celebrate" as "prophets" in order to "profit" from--

that there isn't much of a "profit" really involved with their lives!--

but then perhaps they have become too confused, as so many banks, investors=
,
economists and the rest are, between fact and fiction, life and art, betwee=
n
the number of copies printed and the number of them actually sold--and an
endless laundry list of other practical discrepancies that get lost in the
haze of the Opium smoke and mirrors of Capital run amok--rooting and
grunting like specially trained pigs sent out after truffles where in fact
none have have ever been known to exist--and forced to try to convince
themselves that perhaps the root of a dandelion may have a powerful value a=
s
yet unknown, beyond the mere making of dandelion wine--

perhaps everything has become so confused that it no longer simply that
"signs are taken for wonders" as Marx wrote, but that persons now take thei=
r
own signs as wonders, those signs by which they convince themselves of the
wonders which others are convincing them of, so that in order to "play the
game" one is not simply a fool of an other, but has been fooling oneself
very deeply also, and maybe or not knowing this, somewhere down inside, tha=
t
is , that one is betraying oneself in order to enable others to reach their
objectives which they have sold you on as a pipe dream

and for all one knows
an alaska pipe line pipe dream!!

thanking you again very much Barry--

After Rimbaud's Illuminations (book)David-Baptiste Chirot

Print: $5.00

To think of Rimbaud as a cartographer is in no way a stretch of the
imagination. And to think that Chirot has used one of Rimbaud's maps to
traverse his memory while simultaneously his dreams, is altogether
possible=97and it seems this is what Chirot has done.

Dear Poets,

If you visit Listen & Be Heard Poetry Cafe Blog at http://
www.listenandbeheard.net/home
you will find that we are now hosting a poetry television channel and
a weekly radio show that includes poetry.

These new developments mean that there are more ways available for
you to participate. Each day a new poetry video will be added to the
start of the poetry loop that is part of the programming of Listen &
Be Heard Network Television. If you have produced a poetry video
which you would like to have featured, you may submit the url: to
editor@listenandbeheard.net.

We will be producing a live video open mic for the channel in the
future. In order to participate in the video open mic will need
access to a computer, video camera and an internet connection. More
information will be coming about that soon. In the meantime, please
be sure to submit whatever video content that you would like to have
aired on our poetry channel.

Every Tuesday night is now a radio open mic night, when I will be
hosting an hour long arts show featuring arts news, storytelling,
radio drama and poetry. This is a move away from having a different
suject matter each week, to a magazine format that features
everything every week. You can find the schedule and click to listen
at http://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard. You can call in
between 8 and 9pm (California, USA time) to kick a poem at
718-506-1481. There is also a click to talk feature on the web page.

You can send url's to soundfiles for the Radio show to
editor@lisltenandbeheard.net or send your cd or dvd to L&BH Network,
1221 Monterey St. suite 4, Vallejo, CA 94590.

We also continue to publish the Poem of the Day for which we are
always seeking submissions, http://www.listenandbeheard.net/home/wp-
admin/post-new.php
and welcome your query about a poetry column.

Wishing you Peace and Poetry

Available now from Finishing Line Press: "Animal Husbandry" by Susan =
Lewis. Coming to bookstores and Amazon.com in late November.=20

=93Animal Husbandry is an accomplished set of playful and bracing poems. =
The temperature rises with feverish melodic articulations of ironies and =
transpositions. Emoticons express passion with rare pleasure, folded into =
the practice of breeding, this time with lines of verse.=93Dots dance on =
paper,/molecules bump, so listen=94 to these coy, funny and haunting =
poems.=94 =20
								      =
=97Norma Cole

=93I am grateful for the generous beauty of this collection. Language =
informs the remarkable poems it contains as much as the sensuous truths =
that attend the memory of experience. Because of this, and the lyrical =
skill that gracefully unites them, they are possessed of a startling and =
passionate clarity.=94                    					=
	                                                            =
=97Chuck Wachtel

=93Animal Husbandry=94 is a playful and rigorous rediscovery of poetry's =
ability to make linguistic conceptual abstraction into sensory experience, =
and vice versa. It invites readers to share not only the intellection but =
also the affective energies of its sung queries about how the "all this =
too much we know now" suffuses our erotic, political, and parental lives. =
These poems orchestrate tone, melody, rhythm, and syntax to bring across =
the urgency of their nuanced questioning about matters stretching from our =
origin as a species to all too recent political catastrophes. With their =
gift for formal and stylistic compression, for condensation laced with =
startling shifts of speed and sound, these poems transform the necessary =
limitations of the coin of the realm into the making of virtuoso turns on =
a dime.

(with advance apologies to all those who evidently are driven mad by any
display of someone's poor research skills):

I'm trying to find a really old Ashbery article--not included in Reported
Sightings--from the period when he was living in Paris (1958-68 or something
like that?) in either Art News or Art International I think--it's a review
of a group Pop Art show in Paris, in which he praises Warhol and disparages
most of the rest of the show.  What I (mis-?) remember is:

"Are we supposed to hate Hires root beer, love it, or hate ourselves for
loving it?  Whichever it is, these polemics need a retread."

and also, re Warhol, something about how his paintings "are a meditation on
our time and not just a mean reflection of it" (that's probably pretty
inaccurate)

(also: thanks to the several people who responded with useful clues for
tracking down the old POETICS list Ed Dorn cross-fire posts)

VIZNAR, Spain - The tranquil, pine-carpeted hills in this patch of
southern Spain hold awful secrets. Now, one of them has been thrust
into the spotlight of a still painful accounting of atrocities
committed in the Spanish Civil War.

                        The dispute has arisen over whether to open the gra=
ve of Federico Garcia Lorca, widely considered Spain's best 20th century po=
et and playwright.

At the start of the 1936-39 war, Viznar, near the ancient city of
Granada, became one of many execution grounds for perceived opponents
of Francisco Franco, the army general who unleashed the conflict by rising =
up against the elected, leftist Republican government.

People were rounded up, brought here and shot, their bodies dumped in a rav=
ine in unmarked graves =97 all for simply having been considered supporters=
 of the government.
Garcia Lorca
was shot along with a schoolteacher named Dioscoro Galindo Gonzalez and
two labor union activists =97 Francisco Galadi and Juan Arcolla =97 on Aug.
18, 1936. Their bodies are believed buried near an olive tree near
Viznar.

Lorca, dead at 38, is best known for tragedies such as "Blood Wedding"
and his poetry collections "Poet in New York and "Gypsy Ballads." His
work draws on universal themes =97 love, death, passion, cruelty and
injustice.

Thanks, it's a book I own, though, or more accureately, am a caretaker of;
there is a group of books largely from Vilna at a second-hand bookstore
here, most published near the beginning of World War II.

Alec Finlay & Uche Nduka

Alec Finlay is an artist, poet and publisher. He was born in Scotland and
moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 2002 to be artist in residence at BALTIC
Centre for Contemporary Art. He now lives in Byker and has a studio in the
Ouseburn Valley. His most recent books are three estates renga (platform
projects), what changes change (Redfox), Specimen Colony (Liverpool
University Press) and One Hundred Year Star-Diary. Alec is particularly wel=
l
known for his investigation of poetic forms, such as the mesostic name poem=
,
haiku and renga, woven poems and sewing circles, circle poems and
letterboxing. These forms, often employed in collaborative or anthological
projects, are in turn a means to investigate and represent shared
consciousness. Recent projects include a residency at Kielder Forest, where
Alec created a 100 Year Star-Diary for a new observatory; a long term
collaboration with NaREC, the National Centre for Renewable Energy (Blyth),
creating colour and text designs for windmill turbines; and a series of
projects for the RHS gardens, including a Xylotheque and Dictionary of
Imagined Flowers. During a long term residency at Yorkshire Sculpture Park
Alec created a number of permanent works, including propogator, Field-Guide
and a letterbox walk. Alec's most recent exhibitions are thoughts within
thoughts, ARC (Sofia, Bulgaria) and sunbeams giving the air a kiss, Millais
Gallery (Southampton, UK). Uche Nduka is a poet, essayist, songwriter and
anthologist. Born and raised in Nigeria, he has lived in Holland, Germany
and the U.S. He is the author of seven volumes of poems, a book of prose,
and is the editor of two anthologies of poetry. Winner of the Association o=
f
Nigerian Authors Poetry Prize for 1997, some of his writings have been
translated into Dutch, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. Until recently, h=
e
taught literature at the University of Bremen, Germany. His latest volume o=
f
poems is titled eel on reef (Akashic Books, New York, 2007). Some new poems
of his were published in The Recluse and Boog City this year. Nduka
presently lives and works in New York City.

Calling works for an unprecedented mashup of two stately publishing venues:


 [image: The Mad Hatters' Review & Bunk Magazine]

Wedding date: Spring/Summer 2009
Reception: The Mad Bunkers' Mash & Racket Club, Bronx, NY & Somewhere off
the L.A. Freeway, date TBA

****************

Mashup is the spirit of the day (second only to dementia): Mash a Democrat
and a Tory. Mash a Hip Hop CD with Beethoven's Ninth. Mix the movie Dark
Victory with a modern Japanese horror movie sound track. Cross eclairs with
ecosystems, a Bush speech with a toilet brush. Of course, writers have been
mashing for quite some time with their cutups and exquisite corpses.

Mashup is what happens when content is no longer king, usurped by the
mischievous jester adept at standing on his head and hands, spouting
irreverent nonsensical sense, walking with frivolity on ceilings,
pirouetting on paradoxes, ridiculing rules and rulers, and turning rapid
somersaults -- all for the pleasure of the jester, her audience, and his
sagacious self.

**Boog City
http://www.welcometoboogcity.com

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 17th year and Eas=
t
Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series=8Bd.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where up to 13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, Cake Shop, CBGB=B9s, and The Knitting
Factory. Past albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana,
Nevermind; and Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.


**Liv Carrow
http://www.myspace.com/livcarrow
=20
Navel gazing, highly biographical, cathartic lyricism, obnoxious punning,
moot metaphor, unabashed self-consciousness, and run-on sentences of
self-promotion are qualities nary as compelling as in the case of NYC's Liv
Carrow. Her songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old nieces
and nephews make out of play-doh; lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but all kinds of squishy on the inside.
=20
The mysterious and oddly lovable bassist from ecstatically weird acts
Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the True Believers takes the scenic back roa=
d
to your heart with her porch-swing guitar folk songs and clever-ish
observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction, the
unseen world of cosmic currents, awkward crushes, metaphysics, and,
everyone's favorite, despair.
=20
Her influences run the gauntlet from Patsy Cline to Kate Bush to Michael
Gira. Her debut album, It's About Time, recorded and produced by
Huggabroomstik co-frontman Dashan Coram, is available through Olive Juice
Music.

Press), (Soma)tic Midge (Faux Press), and The Book of Frank (Chax Press),

**Casey Holford + Daoud Tyler-Ameen
http://www.caseyholford.com/
http://www.myspace.com/artsororityforgirls
=20
Casey Holford was raised on a diet of folk music and comic books in
Massachusetts. He started playing piano at 12, picked up his mother's guita=
r
for coffeehouse and DIY shows at 14, and was performing regularly in the
Boston-Providence songwriter circuit by 18. Now, living in Brooklyn at age
27, he has recorded three self-released solo albums, two EPs, and a 7-inch
on RiYL records. He moonlights in the bands Outlines, Urban Barnyard, Dream
Bitches, and Art Sorority for Girls, playing bass, electric, 12 string, and
baritone guitars. Casey is also a prolific producer, helping to document hi=
s
community by working on projects with fellow bands and songwriters, most
recently pop riot Cheese on Bread, visionary Dave Deporis, and upstart
Creaky Boards.
=20
Daoud Tyler-Ameen grew up on the lower east side of Manhattan. His
songwriting career began in high school with a string of extra-credit
projects about literary characters and the life cycles of plants. After
graduation he started a new project called the Art Sorority for Girls, a
collection of story-songs about the awful messes kids can get themselves
into. Daoud's versatility as a drummer and multi-instrumentalist is the
creative glue that has helped to hold Urban Barnyard, Outlines, and Cheese
on Bread together. Daoud is working on Art Sorority's debut long player wit=
h
Casey, Major Matt Mason USA, and Andrew Hoepfner.
=20

**Ben Kreiger
http://www.benkrieger.com/
=20
Ben often claims to be a Brooklyn songwriter. Anyone who meets him, however=
,
can immediately tell that he probably grew up in Cleveland. There was a
short-lived campaign in the mid-'80s when everyone in Northeast Ohio had a
bumper sticker that said, "New York May Be the Big Apple, But Cleveland's a
Plum!" Ben has been a plum among the apples for 10 years.
=20
In the summer of 2008 Ben took over from Lach as "Jay Leno of the Sidewalk.=
"
He books the club and runs the Open Stage on Monday nights.
=20
His latest CD, Class Dismissed, is a concept record about community and the

himself and others at his home studio, The Rock Closet. He likes to record
rock operas.

**Phoebe Kreutz
http://www.myspace.com/phoebekreutz
=20
Phoebe Kreutz is a boozy floozy with a heart of gold. She sings silly songs
about the things she likes best: boys and bars and vikings and tacos.
=20
Growing up in New York's East Village, Phoebe learned a lot about all these
things. She also learned a lot about rhyming from Dr. Seuss and the joys of
thinly veiled social commentary from "He-Man" and "The Smurfs."
=20
Now she's all grown up and still loving life in the big city. She gets to
sing in all kinds of fun places like The Knitting Factory, Fez, Birdland,
and The Sidewalk Caf=E9. It was there that she found the jolly antifolk scene=
,
which has nurtured and indulged her like a benevolent uncle these past few
years. It was also there that she met the boys who would later join with he=
r
to become the world's greatest art-indie-rock band that only sings about
animals in the city, Urban Barnyard.

Out now: Masthead 11: Poetryetc Special Issue

Poetryetc: Poems and Poets
An anthology edited by Andrew Burke and Candice Ward

http://www.masthead.net.au/

"What made the Poetryetc listserv distinct from the beginning was John
Kinsella's internationalism, and his vision of its being a space for
collaborative projects as well as dialogue and exchange...From 1997,
Poetryetc projects collectively represent hundreds of poems by dozens
of poets, by any measure an extraordinary explosion of collective
creativity....

"This anthology is the most recent of the Poetryetc projects. Edited
by Candice Ward and Andrew Burke, with an e-book designed by Peter
Ciccariello, it represents a selection of poems written by list
members over the past few years. It includes many distinguished poets
side by side with new or little known voices, and demonstrates the
diversity and stylistic openness that was always a major strength of
Poetryetc."

I think this is premature. Agreement can be used strategically to disarm
your opponents, or lull them into thinking they have the floor, are dealing
with a weakling, or that their ideas are any good.

There is speculation (wildly made, at this juncture) that McCain has
suffered a stroke and that this has been kept from voters. Those who are
doin' the speculatin' are citing McCain's increasingly frequent
mispronunciations (where before, there were less...apparently). This is an
interesting idea and, if true, really scary.

Steve I have to admit I wasn't too excited about that debate either.  There
were some shining moments though about the war from Obama.  My favorite line
was, "John, you act like the war started in 2007" when responding to
McCain's bullshit lines about HOW THE SURGE WORKED.

It makes me nothing but sick, thinking of such a thing as a surge "working"
keeping grave diggers working.

Just the other day I watched a documentary called THE RESTLESS CONSCIENCE
which is about the anti-Nazi resistance within Germany from 1933 to 1944.
This is a film I want EVERY American high school kid to watch!  Hava Kohav
Beller is the director, and I admire how the post-production was so smooth
in ways many documentaries lack, meaning overlay of live interviews with
photos.  It's stunning, chilling.  IT GIVES you a sense of doom while
maintaining an intense sense of HOPE about what we can do to end evil.

I'm voting for Obama because he REALLY WILL get us out of Iraq.  If other
Democrats had won the party's nomination I don't think I would be voting
Democrat, as I REFUSE to vote for anyone who voted for the war.

Obama is not perfect, and I'm really SICK of the way he talks about Welfare
Reform, as though the 700 million dollar bailout isn't anything but welfare
for the rich!  But I'm voting for him to stop the war, because that killing
much STOP!

steve,

don't buy the republican spin: every obama agreement was followed up in very
short order by a clear and significant departure. granted, obama showed
mccain more deference than he's due (which in my book is next to zero). it's
called being a respectful statesman. by contrast, mccain couldn't bring
himself to even look his opponent in the eye...

regards,
tom orange

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dearest Friends,

As you all know by now, Robert Dunn died on Thursday night, of a massiv=
heart attack while at his health club.  He was taken to the hospital, b=t
they weren't able to save him.  My heart is broken, and I'm sure, for
m=ny of us, there will be continued shock and sorrow.

According to the family (from what Babette Albin has told me) there wil=
be no public funeral.  His family has opted for a closed-casket, private
service.  Nevertheless, since those of us who knew Robert knew that --
aside from his Mother -- he considered his fellow poets (poets &am=;
musicians) to be his real family, as he often said, it is we who must
create his memorials and also the celebrations of his life.

I have spoken to Tone Bellizi at The Vault, and he has suggested
Saturd=y, October 11th (two weeks from today) to have the memorial at the
Vault. =He plans to have us from 9 p.m. till whenever.

I will be speaking to Brigid Myrnaghan at the Back Fence shortly to
see=20 what she would like us to do at the Back Fence.  It is possible
that th= event which had been planned for tomorrow with Goldiva as the
feature, will =o on, but with tributes to Robert.  Since this is all such
short notice, there will possibly be some other event there at the Back
Fence that is more=20 formally planned for a later date, for when
everyone who wasn't planning on going tomorrow can attend.  In speaking
to Su Polo, I got the impressio= she might be thinking of setting up
something, too.  It's possible that=20 Evie Ivy and/or Patricia Carragon,
both of whom host events, may wish to set=up something at their events.
I just don't know any more at this time.&nb=p;

As Lisa Roma (and Su) said, Robert's just on another plane now, and he'=l
always be with us, but I wish to God he were still here with us, to laugh
wi=h, crack wise with, -- yes, and even to argue with -- and Lord knows,
he was so=20 opinionated (aren't we all) that every one of us probably
disagreed with him=20 about something, sometime, but I would give anythng
to be able to hear his v=ice and hug him once again.

Stan Barkan graciously agreed to be the one who sent out the notice of
where/when regarding the funeral, but since none but his uncle and
cousins (=nd maybe sister-in-law) will be at the funeral, we must begin
to plan our thoughts and memorials to him.  If possible, we'll try to set
up a MySp=ce page for people to add
comments and poems.  Thanks you all for your gracious calls and loving
thoughts.

In the interim, you may also be receiving other emails from people
with=20 bulk mailing lists.  Please forgive the duplication; the
Department of Redundancy Department is working full-time now, as we all
send out the info =o all our friends and colleagues.  Also forgive me if
there's any typos -= I can't see because of the tears as I write this.

Love, from
Leigh
P.S.  While I was adding the addresses, I got a call from Robert M=lby
upstate, who's reading tonight and told me he's dedicating his reading to
Robert.  Bless you, Milby, for that!...L.

With regret, I'm writing to say that Diane di Prima had to cancel her
reading at The Beat Generation Symposium next month at Columbia College
Chicago.

I'm please to announce that Michael McClure will now be the featured
poet on Saturday, October 11.

I've pasted below the full list of panels and events (including a
reading Oct. 12 by Michael Rothenberg and David Meltzer, part of the
great Myopic Books Reading Series here in Chicago).  As always, feel
free to email back with questions!  Hope to see you there--

Best,
Tony

JOANNE KYGER, a native California writer, is the author of over 20 books

College, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the Beat Generation.  Her

New College of San Francisco.  She lives on the coast north of San
Francisco.

One of the core group of Beat poets who gained fame in 1950s San
Francisco, MICHAEL MCCLURE is also a playwright, journalist and
memoirist. His life and writing reveal a deep interest in nature,
ecology, and consciousness. McClure continues to live and work in San
Francisco where he is more active than ever, writing and performing his
poetry at festivals, as well as colleges and clubs across the country.
Most recently McClure joined with composer Terry Riley to create a CD
titled I Like Your Eyes Liberty. Recent books include Huge Dreams: San
Francisco and Beat Poems, Rain Mirror, and Touching the Edge.

With hibernation comes rejuvination...

f_p has been sleeping a long three years! now, as it awakens, it's looking =
for patrons and poems.

I've not yet written a prospectus or manifesto or whatever but many of you =
know the deal: f_p is all about the intertext, readings of readings, writin=
g based in reading and writing, what Coolidge asks, "What do you see when y=
ou look out with your language?"

I hope to have a good deal of manuscripts by next year. In the meantime, I =
hope some of you will query this ambiguous eMail!

Also, since we're non-profit, we'll be looking for donations and supporters=
 (and if you wish to contribute, or know a good, sure way to get funding, p=
lease contact me at cacasama@towson.edu).

We also have an extensive back catalogue that's been sitting in boxes for a=
 bit, and I'm looking to get rid of everything and start afresh - any donat=
ions will be received with a flourish of chapbooks, pamphlets and other str=
ange objects!

Cheers, and thanks for making f_p alive again!

When the Dow (the Tao of the wicked) plummeted 777 points yesterday I felt
awe and relief.  In our age we don't need to arrive at the castle gates with
pitchforks and torches, the rich will undo themselves.

"Average folks" will also suffer everyone's saying.  Aren't we already?  The
makeshift village of NICKELVILLE was attacked the other night by POLICE!
The homeless cannot even be allowed homelessness.

When I was a kid my mother and I lived in our car for a little more than
half a year.  It's a terrible thing to have to live like that.  But the
problem with our culture the way it is is that unless A LOT of people are
living like that, few will do anything to help.  We have SO MUCH in this
country SO MANY resources, there's no reason we can't change the way we're
living and be better people for one another.

Let the numbers dive into the abyss!  When we're all eating the litter of
our former selves we'll be nicer to everyone along the way who needs a
hand.  When I think back on the people who were brutal to us when we were
living in that car, I also think about the handful of folks who were
generous.  Every single person who was generous was poor themselves, barely
enough for their own tables.

Let the numbers escape them!  Let this be the most amazing time of our
lives!  I'm NOT ONE TO PRAY, but I'm praying that on Thursday there's still
no deal, and that the numbers crash and burn them out of their mansions and
country clubs.

GRACIAS A LA VIDA!

MIME-Version: 1.0

The inaugural issue of grain short/grain long
(http://www.sundress.net/grainshortgrainlong) is now available,
featuring excellent work by Suzanne Grazyna, Virginia Reeves,
Elizabeth Kate Switaj, & C. R. E. Wells in response to the theme
"grain short/grain long."

Our next issue will center around the theme "Collaboration / Stimulus
/ Response." We are looking for works that collaborate with, are
stimulated by, &/or respond to other writers & artists. The vehicle --
be it ekphrasis, tag-team writing, plain ol' inspiration, etc. -- is
immaterial. We want to see what you come up with. This is a broad
topic, so we hope to get a variety of interpretations.

grain short/grain long is open to all types of poetry, prose, visual,
& hybrid works. We are especially interested in submissions from
women; Southerners; unknown, unpublished, & under-represented artists;
or anyone whose projects have been described as "innovative,"
"experimental," "avant-garde," "post-avant," "eccentric," or just
plain "odd."

Potential contributors may submit up to four (4) poems, four thousand
(4,000) words of prose, or images up to 2 MB in response to the
current call to flaming [dot] giblet [at] gmail [dot] com. (Of course,
replace the bracketed words with the appropriate symbols.)

Accepted file formats include JPG, TIFF, BMP, ODT, DOC, & RTF. Other
formats will be considered on an individual basis -- query first.
Projects that stretch the limits of print are welcome, so long as
their execution is feasible within our (alas, oh so limited)
resources. Hint: Make it great. The more we love it, the more likely
we are to finesse something for you.

Submissions in response to "Collaboration / Stimulus / Response" will
be accepted until December 31, 2008.
