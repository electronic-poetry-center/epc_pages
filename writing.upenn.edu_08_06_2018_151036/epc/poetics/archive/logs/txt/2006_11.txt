Hi all,

I thought some of you might be interested in revisiting this lengthy piece
our late friend Brad Will wrote for Boog City in the spring of 2005--
"Fragments of a Shattered Hope: Brazil Makes War on Sohno Real Squatters."

The news of Brad Will's death keeps coming in from so many corners. I didn't know him, but he knew so many of my friends, and friends of friends, in the worlds of folk music, activism, and poetry... my condolences to any of you who knew him.

Here's to the people struggling in Oaxaca, and to Brad Will, who was telling that story.


Andy Gricevich
http://ndgwriting.blogspot.com

*

From Judy Ancel of the Kansas City Cross Border network, via Anne Feeney, labor singer:

Send a letter to President Fox at the email address below and tell him we are watching them and to stop the repression and violence against the people of Oaxaca and the teachers union local #22 and resolve the conflict peacefully:

 vicente.fox.quesada@presidencia.gob.mx

  Sample letter (please write your own):

  Dear President Fox:

  For months we have been worried about the massing of repressive force threatening the teachers union and APPO in Oaxaca by state authorities of Governor Ulysses Ruiz. Now it appears they have begun the repression against people operating radio station Planton and shooting at people in the plaza. Newspapers are reporting that primary school teacher Emilio Alonso was gunned down and that Indymedia reporter Brad Will was shot in the chest and killed in the municipality of Calicante and a photographer Oswaldo Ramirez was shot and wounded. There are rumors that other teachers have been shot and killed and that there are many injured.

 Is your government planning to repeat the shame of the massacre at Tlatelolco in 1968, which people around the world still remember? We are watching with alarm. We urge you in the strongest terms to stop the repression and violence against the people of Oaxaca and the teachers union. You must use your power to stop Governor Ruiz from committing a massacre.

*

  In the morning language leaks
  in.  The world too always early
  for representation, too late
  not never             only by a marked
  difference.  A small hole at the stomach
  deflates scale, we who know those
  who knew           sucked to the edge
  of the bubble faster than shots find
  a heroic
  coupling only
  makes class
  war
  boring
  in
  slow
  motion
  arrival of
  news at distances,
  too many to
  want to count.
  A drill
  or siren warning.

  *

  Six month strike.
  Squirrel chase rattles across the ceiling.  Thatâ€™s
  how time gets marked
  and pulled from circulation.  Last night
  we watched Breathless, and the guy who couldnâ€™t make connections
  said that people lie about Mexico.  He didnâ€™t mean Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.
  Itâ€™s starvation and repression that make the struggle against them
  so tiring.  The Times says, â€œdesire for orderâ€
  when itâ€™s desire thatâ€™s hunted,
  worn down.

  *

  The belly vulnerable
  to bullets, to hunger or
  to being filled.
  The gut is that hole
  felt in the heart.

Oaxaca

I had written my nine-months pastoral reverie
An intersection in Oaxaca of avant-garde aesthetics and the peoples'
revolution
acknowledged, always to be incomplete
Then the confrontations and after some months, the violencia
erupted .... I was able to write, disciplina,
for I received news gratefully, even hopelessly jarring news, I wrote:

Faces of the oppressed
become crowds
A machete scored with letters
A People United
See he moves moving along the wall
The shadow of his camera
A white shirt, the boys shout
Distant gunfire
Black smoke of burning tires
Only kids, running, throwing stones
Let me pass
Then the red truck backs,
bang against the gate
Shots follow
The camera spins crazily
The focus, granular from the first frame
And rests on the pavement
under the claw of death
An insupportable stench adheres to the walls
In the glare of tear gas
exhort
desired order
in the throes of what you and I feared
to have become
Disculpame

I didn't know Brad, but I have a friend, Eric Larson, from Brown Univ. =20=

who is in Oaxaca now and has been for months, sending out an email =20

What follows are the two most recent reports I've received from him.  =20=

The first, I just got tonight, around 9pm.  The second is from 10/29, =20=

and *caution*, it includes an account of Brad Will's murder, and may be =20=

Priistas are planning to remove CIPO out of the neighborhood by force!

This part of Santa Lucia is enemy territory.  It is near Barricade =20
Three, the Pr=92ista attack of last Friday, and the site of Brad Will's =20=

murder.  It's also where the CIPO house is located.  When the Pr=92istas =
=20
first set up their barricades, some were directly in front of the CIPO =20=

house, one using materials that had been propped up against the outside =20=

wall.  Now, less than a week after Brad Will's murder, some of the same =20=

Pr=92istas have agreed to "dislodge" CIPO from the neighborhood.  If =20
history, recent and distant, teaches us anything, their method will be =20=

violence.  It is important that they know that acts of violence will =20
not go unseen, even in this small neighborhood that they control.   =20
Please contact some or all of those listed below; tell them that if =20
CIPO is attacked, that the Mexican state is responsible.  And please =20
also keep this in mind as solidarity actions are planned and carried =20
out.

Friends,
We've been stuck in the house. Mysteriously, last night a Yahoogroups =20=

email list a bunch of us use in Oaxaca went down. And, in the CIPO =20
house, we've spent much of the last 8 hours trying to get the internet =20=

connection back up. The Feds have entered the city. I'm including a =20
couple things here. For the past few nights, and some days, I've been =20=

protecting a CIPO member. On Tuesday night / early Wed. morning, we =20
(Vicky, her family, myself, and a group of fifty or so neighbors) =20
created barricades around a local primary school. The neighbors of this =20=

poor colonia built that school through cooperation and barter and =20
"tequio." But PRIistas opened it by force on Monday. The neighbors =20
weren't going to let them continue. And that morning, the fifty of us =20=

-- most with rocks, sticks, big firecrackers, etc. -- stared down more =20=

than 150 of them, perhaps 150 yards away. As the time came .... they =20
never came at us. The PRIistas coordinated their attacks in a much more =20=

aggresive manner on Friday. While I was out in the colonia, some other =20=

compas were in my neighborhood, and here's their account (below). As =20
for the attachment: it's a statement by CIPO meant to be spread around =20=

the world. Don't mourn, organize, right? While we avenge the deaths of =20=

the fallen we need to continue to protect, and fight with, the living, =20=

and especially those, like Vicky, whose lives are in danger. The =20
attachment, then, is an English translation of the CIPO statement =20
(thanks, SLAM).(Spanish version, too)

A group of folks on this list are helping plan actions for this week. =20=

Who else wants to be on the list? How should we do this? Some of you =20
were/are part of either Boston CIPOsolidaridad or the =20
not-quite-established Providence CIPOsolidaridad or LA CIPOsolidaridad. =20=

Do you want to volunteer?

En lucha, Eric

ps. during the PRIistas attacks you could see, from the upper floor of =20=

the CIPO house, some neighbors lobbing rocks from behind their concrete =20=

fences at the movement people.  There's lots of PRi in this =20
neighborhood, and that's why the PRI paramilitaries could seek cover in =20=

houses and businesses. That also means, as all the contradictions here =20=

start to coalesce into one, the neighborhood is less and less safe for =20=

CIPO. If the PRI doesn't fall, it's gonna be a witch hunt here.

pps. to answer someone's question, yes, you still can send money to =20
CIPO or to teacher's delegations, through me. You can send a check to =20=

me at 2866 Lilac Lane, Fargo, ND 58102, or, better, you can deposit =20
money in my account. Email me for the account number.pps. to answer =20
some others' question, the answer must be yes: the key to these actions =20=

has to be disruption. it's the way they do it here and something must =20=

be working.


Account of the Pr=92ista attack in Santa Lucia del Camino in Oaxaca, =20
Mexico


Attacks across the city kill at least 4.

NOTE:  This account is not meant to be a complete account of the day, =20=

it is meant to be from the perspectives and experiences of two people =20=

in the midst of what can only be described as a battle in the streets =20=

of Santa Lucia, in Oaxaca.  We know that other things happened in other =20=

neighborhoods, and that other things probably happened in our vicinity. =20=

  This is our best effort at capturing the events that we experienced =20=

and witnessed.

On Thursday night, Barricade Three in Santa Lucia del Camino set up a =20=

little earlier than normal.  Reinforcing the barricades for Friday's =20
day of action required more trucks and buses than usual.  At times, it =20=

was a chaotic scene with cami=97n after cami=97n joining the barricade =
and =20
people unsure of where they should go.  Eventually things calmed down.  =20=

Many more people than usual guarded the barricade and the tranquility =20=

of the night had many regulars taking time to lie down, if not sleep.  =20=

As day broke, the barricade took on the feel of a community holiday or =20=

small block party with small children running about.  At what felt like =20=

an informal pot-luck, people brought tortillas and beans, sandwiches, =20=

bread, and arroz con leche.  Most chose to not cover their faces, =20
despite this being a regular practice at the barricades.  Up to this =20
point, the only "contentious" moment was the permitted approached of a =20=

chicken truck that surprised several people.

Sudenly, about a dozen people started shouting, donning masks, picking =20=

up Molotov cocktails (known as bombas Molotov) and cohetes (large =20
bottle rockets typically shit out of PVC pipes the people call =20
bazookas), and collecting rocks and sticks.  A small group moved =20
forward to see why a truck that was part of the barricade (about 200 =20
feet away) was moving and investigate a commotion on the other side of =20=

that barricade.  After advancing about 100 feet, the group spotted 150 =20=

to 200 Pr=92istas (supporters of the authoritarian PRI party that ruled =20=

Mexico for 70 years and currently "rule" the state of Oaxaca) marching =20=

toward the barricade.  The cohetes were fired into the air to warn the =20=

Pr=92istas not to approach.  The warning was ignored.

The tiny group of defenders fell back to the barricade and gathered =20
more supplies.  It was a chaotic situation.  Prioritizing in the =20
moment, a split second decision was made to leave our bags, in part =20
because rocks from the Pr=92istas were already falling where our bags =20=

lay.  As we sprinted down side streets to the closest barricade, there =20=

were shouts for children to go inside their homes to safety.  At the =20
next barricade, people were banging on poles and railing to sound the =20=

alarm and rally the neighborhood to fight the Pr=92ista advance.  People =
=20
came out of their homes and armed themselves with sticks, machetes, =20
metal poles, cohetes and rocks.  Once a fairly large crowd had gathered =20=

several people started shouting "Vamos, compa=96erQos, Vamos!" (Let's =
go) =20
and "Avanza!" (advance).  People began advancing to the fallen =20
barricade and the Pr=92istas, spreading out along the width of the =20
four-lane highway, it's median, and sidewalks.  Both sides fired their =20=

cohetes, and as we drew nearer rocks started flying from both sides.  =20=

We pushed the Pr=92istas back passed the remnants of the now =
disassembled =20
barricade. There was a lull of about thirty seconds as we populated the =20=

area around the barricade before many decided to chase the =20
still-visible Pr=92istas only about 100 feet away from us.  Though most =20=

of them retreated faster than we advanced, one unlucky Pr=92istas was =20=

forced to choose his own safety and well-being over that of his fancy =20=

SUV.  The look of regret was visible on his face as rocks crashed to =20
the ground around him and he turned and ran.  The SUV, lacking a =20
license plate, briefly became the target instead of the retreating =20
Pr=92istas.  Tires slashed, windows smashed, someone decided to ensure =20=

that it was beyond use and set it ablaze.  While some focused their =20
attention on the SUV, some continued to chase the Pr=92istas.  Most =20
Pr=92istas had scattered into nearby homes and businesses, so people =20
re-grouped back at the barricade.

As we all clustered in the intersection, the two of us looked around =20
and estimated that there were at least 500 people ready to defend their =20=

neighborhood.  We were both amazed by what we were seeing.  Neither of =20=

us had ever witnessed such an incredible display of collective =20
self-defense.  We both nearly cried at the inspiring sight of people =20
successfully working together to ward off aggression without =20
centralized leadership.  The barricade reclaimed, sandbags replaced, =20
and the Pr=92istas pushed back, the battle appeared for a few moments, =
to =20
be over.

We're unsure as to the exact reason for the second advance, but we =20
believe that Pr=92istas were again spotted at the next intersection =
where =20
they had scattered minutes before.  As we cautiously advanced, walking =20=

in cover when possible, shots were heard from the intersection and =20
everyone ducked or ran for cover.  Many corporate news outlets, most =20
notably those relying on AP "reporter" Rebeca Romero (widely believed =20=

to be on Ulises Ruiz's payroll), have claimed it was "unclear" as to =20
who shot first. It was the Pr=92istas.  =46rom the ground, on the =
receiving =20
end of the gunfire, there is no doubt as to who shot first.  There is =20=

nothing "unclear" about it. It was the Pr=92istas, shown by El Universal =
=20
photos and local television to be armed to the teeth, who shot first.

After the shooting stopped, the group moved quickly to the other side =20=

of the road and to the corner where the shots had originated from.  The =20=

attacking Pr=92istas had retreated back away from the highway and deeper =
=20
into the neighborhood.  Fifty to 100 people slowly advanced north a =20
block into the neighborhood while 200 people gradually moved up, either =20=

by going north, or approaching it from the west by way of the =20
barricade.  Again the group moved north, taking cover by vehicles =20
parked along the street.  In addition to shooters at the far end of the =20=

street, more Pr=92istas were taking cover inside a building along the =20=

street.  The building was targeted with Molotovs, rocks, bricks, and =20
cohetes.  Someone kicked the door in before Pr=92istas down the street =20=

started shooting again and we had to retreat back to the end of the =20
block.  This gave the Pr=92istas time to close and blockade the door.  A =
=20
few attempts with similar results gave way to milling about, as we =20
waited for reinforcements.  One block west towards the barricade, about =20=

100 people had gathered to take cover from additional Pr=92istas on that =
=20
street.  Soon we heard a truck roar to life and a few minutes later, =20
compa=96eros in a dump truck came to provide shielding for another =20
advance.  In the first such advance, the truck went too far down the =20
road, shooting started again, at which point we fell back to the end of =20=

the block.  Most waited there while the truck maneuvered itself =20
horizontally across the street in front of the gate of the targeted =20
building.  Once the truck was ready, another advance began and the =20
truck smashed open the gate.  Another round of shooting began, and =20
again everyone took cover and began to withdraw.

At this point, Brad Will, an Indymedia reporter from New York, was shot =20=

in the abdomen as he was filming.  Many people ran to carry him around =20=

the block and down the street.  As we waited for a car to arrive to =20
take him to the hospital, efforts were made to keep him conscious and =20=

breathing, including CPR. As Brad showed signs of consciousness and =20
movement, the crowd surrounding him cheered. He was carried into a car =20=

and driven to the hospital.  Moments later, as people were still taking =20=

in what happened, it started to rain. People gathered up the Molotovs =20=

and cohetes and got them out of the rain. About a half hour later, =20
people started to gradually head back to the barricade.

When we arrived at the barricade, we learned from a teary-eyed =20
compa=96ero that Brad had died on his way to the hospital. People from =20=

APPO such as Flavo Sosa arrived at the scene and were attempting to =20
coordinate with the rest of the city where there had been other =20
attacks.  Hundreds of bottles were being filled and prepared as Molotov =20=

cocktails.  Thanks to the help of several compa=96eras, we recovered one =
=20
of our bags; though the other which contained a passport, several forms =20=

of id, travelers checks, over $1,000 pesos (most of which was intended =20=

to be used for the barricade), a video camera, is gone and was =20
presumably stolen by the Pr=92istas.  Hundreds remained at the barricade =
=20
for the night. The two of us went to a compa=96ero's house to rest, =
write =20
and watch the news.

As of this writing, the Pr=92istas have set up their own barricades =20
within the neighborhood, APPO has activated the mobile brigades, 4 or 5 =20=

people have died, dozens injured, and barricade 3 remains up, =20
reinforced, and alert.  Among the attackers were local municipal police =20=

(such as Abel Santiago Z=87rate and Juan Carlos Soriano Velasco) and =20
politicians/PRI thugs (such Manuel Aguilar and Pedro Carmona, the man =20=

identified as Brad Will's killer), all from the neighborhood.  Though =20=

the two of us had slightly differing expectations of how the day would =20=

pan out, neither of us expected an attack of this kind or magnitude in =20=

broad daylight.  The diversity of people who fought the Pr=92ista =20
attackers was astounding.  We saw young kids helping to gather cohetes =20=

and Molotovs.  We saw old women armed with rocks making their way to =20
the front.  We saw people wearing circle As, hammer and sickles, and =20
people who didn't wear their political identity on their sleeves. In =20
the end, it didn't matter who you were, only what side you stood on.

With Michael Kelleher's support and assistance, here
are some recently published Creeley letters. In
addition to insights they provide into RC's later
correspondences, I do think these letters would make
for useful material in either classes or workshops.

Dear Friends:

Hi !

This Friday Nov. 3rd at CUE Art Foundation Alice Notley is reading.  Some of

So, it's election time--and I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring---

If you're curious of some of my thoughts on the controversy unleashed
by John Kerry's recent comments
about being "STUCK IN IRAQ" if one doesn't get a "good education,"
you can read my informal, amateur (just coz I haven't found anyone to
pay yet), thoughts
---replete with a cheesy football metaphor-conceit----and probably
typeos
at

you can still check out my monthly column (it used to be weekly, but
they're cutting back) at

(recent entries on The Coup, John and Yoko, Corporate Endorsements, etc)

Oh, and if you happen to be in San Francisco
(yes, the city where the mayor tells people not to come out for 10/31
celebrations
because of the self-fulfilling threat of violence; which KPOO says is
more of a problem here
than in NYC New Year's Eve and New Orleans Mardi Gras---and they got
a point)---

and you want to see/hear some free music (donations accepted),
come to the REVOLUTION CAFE on THURSDAY NOVEMBER 16th.
I'll be playing some originals on solo piano
and will be sharing the bill with JULIE NAPOLIN (CITAY)
and ANTONIO ROMAN-ALCALA (CONSPIRACY OF BEARDS---The Leonard Cohen
tribute band);
they'll be doing solo guitar stuff....
                                                                       a

It was perfectly obvious to me that Kerry was referring to Bush as
the lazy student who got stuck in Iraq, and he tried half-heartedly
to explain himself in those terms. I actually thought it was pretty funny.

me too. of course, it's easy to get the wrong idea if the punchline is taken out of context and repeated incessantly as if John Kerry really did think a bunch of dummies were in the army. Of course, it just goes to show how stupid the media is, since the "stuck in iraq" comment doesn't even make sense if it's referring to the troops.

With Michael Kelleher's support and assistance, here are some recently
published Creeley letters. In addition to insights they provide into RC's
later correspondences, I do think these letters would make for useful
material in either classes or workshops.

the sad irony is a lot of the soldiers in Iraq joined National Guard and
Army originally to help pay for their education

the dummies are the ones who sent them to Iraq the dummies who voted them
into office dummies who've let too long go by without questioning gov't
policies . . .

that i consider offensive.

there are many reasons young folks are going into the military--none of them
expecting (or able to expect) what terror war is.

it's not their "job" to know, b/c there is now way they possibly
could--which is why kerry was right: the administration are idiots enough to
allow these young men and women to enlist under false pretense...

young men and women now are enlisting because they need that money to get to
college.  they are being led into a quagmire of a war by someone (and his
advisors) who live outside reality.

the comment posted here by vulture protein casts this debate back into black
and white poles--clearly at the other end of the spectrum (or maybe not).
maybe the admin also thinks that all soldiers are idiots, and so have no
problem marching them off to their deaths.

but it's still the easy, incorrect way of casting this issue.

and frankly, it is insulting.

although again, taken out of context. within the context of what it was, a comedy routine by an edgy comedian around the time of the first gulf-war and directed at the controversy around the "don't ask don't tell" regulation change, I don't think it's offensive at all.

It's not taken out of context by Angela though. "Vulture" took it out of the
context in which Hicks said it, and placed it into this one, making it
offensive (IMO).

that's the US, baby -- are you some kind of plant from the Canadian
immigration board?=20

just be grateful, doubly grateful, that you live in a country with
state-subsidized media -- the current mass media product our country
creates is so toxic with free-market-born crap that nowhere can you get
a reasonably informative, level-headed newscast within our borders.
(which reminds me: I need to rent "Network" -- supposedly still relevant
after 30 years)

the last vestige that I know of was Newsworld International (also
Canadian), which Al Gore bought in '04 so he could make it over as a
24-hour teenie-bopper network (Current TV).

terrific.=20

Bill O'Reilly is one of the leading, most widely watched, and highly
respected American political commentators. Conservative independent type,
with small but noticeable hints of liberalism here and there. Generally a
good time. Also, fan of falafel and young chicks -- preferably together at
once.

Hi All,
  I just finished watching Winter Soldiers, the movie about the Vietnam  Vets Against the War. I am of the Vietnam War generation, and protested  against the war; however, I did not realize the number of atrocities  that were committed in Vietnam. After watching that movie, I can only  conclude that My Lai was a routine mission.

I agree that questions of this sort are very interesting. Not that I have an
answer. I note that there are exceptions. Such as "its properties are in
disarray," where possession is not indicated by an apostrophe. because that
would also indicate "it is properties are in disarray".

One of the wonderful things about natural language is that it is so fucked
up. Unlike, say, computer languages, which are marvelously logical. But are
not as expressive as natural language. Or at least not as expressive in
certain ways.

An essay that attempted to answer your question--what would it be like? It
would explore the history of the issue, the history of the relation of the
apostrophe and possession in the English language. Which might need to cover
some interesting territory such as attitudes toward possession and
ownership, historically. One would hope, at any rate, that such a topic
would be germane to the history. Maybe it isn't, though. Perhaps possession
came to be indicated by the apostrophe via contraction. I mean that perhaps
possession was formerly denoted by something longer and was shortened to the
apostrophe s.

That'd be my guess.

Greetings

"...apostrophes began to be used to mark possession in the late
16c....Scholars have generally regarded this use of the apostrophe as
arising from the omission of the letter e in Old and Middle English
-es genitive singular endings (such as mannes man's, scipes ship's),
spreading in due course to all genitives, with or without and e and
plural as well as singular." And so on and so on. Oxford Companion to
the English Language.

What seems a case of possession not marked
by the apostrophe occurs in the title of
John Donne's "Ignatius his Conclave."

I thought Andrews would have fared much better against O'Reilly than he did,

Context is everything. O'Reilly
shilling for FOX shilling for Murdoch
owns that context... in all its ambience
and in all its manifestations... Witness
how much of it bled into the following
segments chocked full of remarks about
academics/ professors and the ultimate
bogeyman.... Churchill.

Not much ground to be gained there sadly.

As for John Kerry, he upset the Republicans by telling the truth and then (the fool ) he apologized for telling the truth out of fear that it might aid said Republicans or hurt the Democrats this Tuesday.  That would seem at least to me to be all that can be said about Mr. Kerry's latest statement.  Am I wrong?  And what does it have to do with the writing to which this site is dedicated, anyway?

It feels to me what Kerrey said was utterly idiotic, disqualifying him from
ever becoming president. Not only does he see two Americas, he embraces this
division. I thought he was better than that. Personally, I would never vote
for him again, though i did last time and I can not imagine ever voting
Republican.

If Webb is elected in Virginia, I think he will be the only person in the
Congress whose child is serving in Iraq.

Murtha is right. The draft would be the way to spread the burden of war
equally on the population. Then, one can see how ready or reluctant the
country would be to go to war. Would this stupid, disastrous war have
occured?

I didn't watch the show past the one-on-one between Andrews and O'Reilly, so
I can't address that.

In the one-on-one, it seemed obvious that Andrews explained his position
more clearly than O'Reilly could grasp it.  Including "pro-American" and
"pro-capitalist" views probably isn't relevant to the course Andrews
teaches.
I'm aware of Andrews' leftist inclinations, but, as he said, context is
important. I understood how he intends to use the book in question, but
O'Reilly apparently didn't.

About the only thing s I personally can fault Andrews for is failing to
break a rock by banging his head against it.

There are many people who need money for college and don't sign up to be war
fodder (ie paid killers, ie or assist in killing through tech / med and
assorted "support" positions).

You don't have to sign up for the military to go to college.  But it's
insulting to believe that this is the only option for these unfortunate
people.

There are other ways, there always is.

How does signing up for the military because you "need money for college"
make you not morally or ethically accountable for your actions and the
outcome of the war?  They are paid and willing participants.  They are
making money just like the old men at the top.  (Shall we explore the
reasons why the old and sexually impotent send the young and sexually virile
to war?  Isn't there some unconscious / conscious satisfaction involved in
this?  Isn't there something to that?)

I'd rather be an uneducated loser than a murderer.

Conversely there are some people who feel like a nobody and join the
military to be somebody.  Have you seen the commerical where the recruit
comes back home and is talking to all of his buddies who are living a
civilian life, and he stares smugly back at them while he has war flashbacks
strobing through his mind?  Who does he think he is?

Do I think recruits are stupid?  I think they are morally suspect, carving
out their corporate future in blood.  But hey, they are being all they can
be.

I think it would be interesting if the military recruited from our prison
system.  Why not send death row inmates off to fight the war?  They already
have a heightened killer instinct, and if they are killed in action, then
there is no loss of innocent life.  The judicial system is unreliable, so
let's just send the people who were convicted on DNA evidence.  Why not?

The difference between a marine, a suicide bomber, and a terrorist is what
you call it.

One country's terroist is another country's freedom fighter.

Murat,

Restoring the draft would just about complete the regressions in social
policy that lie at the heart of the Bush administration. The Vietnam war
proved instrumental in ending the draft, after about seven years of protest.

Murtha may be right, but I wouldn't want to see the draft reinstated under
any circumstances, especially not these. I came before the lottery system,
so I had five years to worry about being called, not one. Reinstating the
draft might be a way to show lack of support for the war, but it will also
reinstate a regressive policy that messed up the lives of many people ages
18-25 the last time it was in effect. It's very hard to start a career or
find a job when you're eligible to be drafted. I know from experience.

I didn't see immediately that Kerry was trying to slam Bush. If he'd
delivered his "joke" more clearly, he might have made the point. I didn't
think he clearly insulted the troops either, although he left room for that
(over)interpretation. He put his foot in his mouth and chewed on it.

The problem with Kerry is that no matter how sincere he seems, he will
always be awkward. He's the kind of guy who could rush you to the emergency
room and save your life, but some detail like an abundance of untrimmed
nasal hair or stale bacon breath would turn you off to him despite his
heroism.

After the Andrews-O'Reilly discussion, I switched briefly to the Comedy
Channel, where some "reporter" said Kerry was losing elections he wasn't
even running in. To me, that sums it up.

If my memory serves me well, I think Bruce teaches or has taught at Fordham
- an historically politically conservative bastion of the Church. I suspect
Bruce developed some genius in countering and deflecting reactionaries in
both the academic and church business. O'Reilly strikes me as a buffoon
version of a Dean of Boys at a similar institution. He can endlessy ridicul=
e
the defense of any boy who has been caught doing 'naughty' things with his
hands. Guilt mongering is his business. (How he did not get brought down fo=
r
the revelation of "his how to use a good 'vibrator' dialogs" with the women
on his staff still amazes me)

Bruce was the 'naughty boy' at hand last night. I thought he did a good job
of not rising - either in anger or outrage - to any of O'Reilly's
predictable 'kiss the flag' tirades and ridicule. To me, Brcce was most
effective in that Bruce just keep his chin-up with a tight-lipped, bemused
but not astonished smile - while putting out a few counter-points - making
O'Reilly fish for every  'my country right-or-wrong" clich=E9 in the book -
and looking and making O' look like an airbag.

It's impossible - in the Fox circumstance - to throw a knock out punch, let
alone make an argument - when the provider controls the "we got to go an
advertisement' levers.

I was glad to see Bruce survive as well as he did. And he will probably be
the first to say his appearance did not effect his poetry book sales one bi=
t
- or maybe just as little bit. Less he and his publishers happily be proved
wrong.

This is a very interesting visual representation (using a flikr-type
idiom) of frequency distributions from concordances of the speeches of
US Presidents.

yes, it's that old genitive (i.e., the possessive form) sticking around =
in English in the form of final 's'... pretty typical across Germanic =
languages.=20

English is a weird pastiche of German and Romance languages (e.g., =
French). at present our grammar allows both for the "de" form (from =
French/Spanish/ Italian, though originally a Latin preposition denoting =
"separation from" or "association with"), "of": "the library of Mr. =
Smith," "journey of Lewis & Clark" -- and the more direct construction =
out of German, which adds an 's to the end of the possessing entity -- =
"Jamie's boyfriend," "Bush's approval ratings," "the city's bridges."=20

the capacity to vary possessive constructions between these two(above =
and beyond idiomatic use) is one of the most exciting qualities of =
English for me. but then I'm kooky that way.=20

as for where the apostrophe comes from, I think it was added over time =
(and orthographic standardization) to distinguish from the truncation of =
the copula:=20

it is --> it's

or

John's eating another sandwich. (instead of "John is")
the truck's about to slam into our tree. (instead of "the truck is")

it doesn't take much work to find problem uses of its/it's, because of =
their homonymy and the users' inability to distinguish between the two =
spellings.=20

by the way, you can see the genitive (in final s *without apostrophe*) =
still working in modern Swedish, one of the closest analog languages to =
English:

he		han			his		hans
she		hon			hers		hennes
it		den/det		its		dess

they 	de 			theirs	deras

final s is often put to use in Swedish nouns to make them genitive, as =
in the news from last night:=20

Kv=E4llens v=E4rd Justin Timberlake blev ocks=E5 kv=E4llens stora =
vinnare n=E4r satellitkanalen MTV h=F6ll sin Europagala i K=F6penhamn.

This evening's host Justin Timberlake also became the evening's big =
winner when the satellite channel MTV held its Europagala in Copenhagen.

"kv=E4llens" =3D "evening's", i.e., possessive/genitive

"...apostrophes began to be used to mark possession in the late
16c....Scholars have generally regarded this use of the apostrophe as
arising from the omission of the letter e in Old and Middle English
-es genitive singular endings (such as mannes man's, scipes ship's),
spreading in due course to all genitives, with or without and e and
plural as well as singular." And so on and so on. Oxford Companion to

this was worth watching Bruce did well, better than many guests on that show....

I would like to go on O'Reilly and rip his head off metaphorically using my 320 pound 6'1 frame to intimidate him physically which is what O'Reilly does-he uses his body, his voice and his positions to do this to people and it is shameful. Those of us who are progressives need to stop being ironic or clever and be tough, as tough as these Republo-Fascists who run our nation as this time....

If my memory serves me well, I think Bruce teaches or has taught at Fordham
- an historically politically conservative bastion of the Church. I suspect
Bruce developed some genius in countering and deflecting reactionaries in
both the academic and church business. O'Reilly strikes me as a buffoon
version of a Dean of Boys at a similar institution. He can endlessy ridicul=
e
the defense of any boy who has been caught doing 'naughty' things with his
hands. Guilt mongering is his business. (How he did not get brought down fo=
r
the revelation of "his how to use a good 'vibrator' dialogs" with the women
on his staff still amazes me)

Bruce was the 'naughty boy' at hand last night. I thought he did a good job
of not rising - either in anger or outrage - to any of O'Reilly's
predictable 'kiss the flag' tirades and ridicule. To me, Brcce was most
effective in that Bruce just kept his chin-up with a tight-lipped, bemused
but not astonished smile - while putting out a few counter-points - making
O'Reilly fish for every  'my country right-or-wrong" clich=E9 in the book -
which made O' look more like an old airbag.

It's impossible - in the Fox circumstance - to throw a knock out punch, let
alone make an argument - when the provider controls the "we got to go an
advertisement' levers.  Frankly, I don't think Amiri Baraka was any more
effective on that program when he kept calling  O'Reilly " crazy" - no
matter how true.

I was glad to see Bruce survive as well as he did. And he will probably be
the first to say his appearance did not effect his poetry book sales one bi=
t
- or maybe just as little bit. Less he and his publishers happily be proved
wrong.

I agree with you, Vernon.  Restoring the draft would be a disaster.  Those who haven't lived under the old draft may not realize what a tyranny it was.  When I was called up for my physical, I was in Italy enjoying my one chance to see Europe, an essential part of education for anybody wishing to be truly educated.  So, even though I knew the army couldn't take me because I then suffered from a seizure disorder, I had to come all the way back to New York in order to go through the formality of being rejected by the army.  While a somewhat vapid argument can be made that we, the people, have less control over what the military industrial complex does to get us into and keep us in wars because the enrolment in the military is now "voluntary", this is dispelled when one remembers how long it took to end the Vietnam War and how many people, both Americans and Vietnamese, died while the government we consider "ours" evaded the obvious defeat which eventually arrived, anyway.  No
 argument in favor of reviving the draft is justifiable, therefore.

Vernon Frazer <frazerv@BELLSOUTH.NET> wrote:  Murat,

Restoring the draft would just about complete the regressions in social
policy that lie at the heart of the Bush administration. The Vietnam war
proved instrumental in ending the draft, after about seven years of protest.

Murtha may be right, but I wouldn't want to see the draft reinstated under
any circumstances, especially not these. I came before the lottery system,
so I had five years to worry about being called, not one. Reinstating the
draft might be a way to show lack of support for the war, but it will also
reinstate a regressive policy that messed up the lives of many people ages
18-25 the last time it was in effect. It's very hard to start a career or
find a job when you're eligible to be drafted. I know from experience.

I didn't see immediately that Kerry was trying to slam Bush. If he'd
delivered his "joke" more clearly, he might have made the point. I didn't
think he clearly insulted the troops either, although he left room for that
(over)interpretation. He put his foot in his mouth and chewed on it.

The problem with Kerry is that no matter how sincere he seems, he will
always be awkward. He's the kind of guy who could rush you to the emergency
room and save your life, but some detail like an abundance of untrimmed
nasal hair or stale bacon breath would turn you off to him despite his
heroism.

After the Andrews-O'Reilly discussion, I switched briefly to the Comedy
Channel, where some "reporter" said Kerry was losing elections he wasn't
even running in. To me, that sums it up.

It feels to me what Kerrey said was utterly idiotic, disqualifying him from
ever becoming president. Not only does he see two Americas, he embraces this
division. I thought he was better than that. Personally, I would never vote
for him again, though i did last time and I can not imagine ever voting
Republican.

If Webb is elected in Virginia, I think he will be the only person in the
Congress whose child is serving in Iraq.

Murtha is right. The draft would be the way to spread the burden of war
equally on the population. Then, one can see how ready or reluctant the
country would be to go to war. Would this stupid, disastrous war have
occured?

I teach college in a conservative community in the heart of   Minnesota.  I can't say this for sure, but I suspect that many  young people who do sign up for the military do so because they love  what it stands for (and I am not certain what it stands for) and they  believe in the cause.

  Simple. Perhaps not that simple, but that is a part of it. The Vietnam War generation was different.

You don't have to sign up for the military to go to college.  But it's
insulting to believe that this is the only option for these unfortunate
people.

There are other ways, there always is.

How does signing up for the military because you "need money for college"
make you not morally or ethically accountable for your actions and the
outcome of the war?  They are paid and willing participants.  They are
making money just like the old men at the top.  (Shall we explore the
reasons why the old and sexually impotent send the young and sexually virile
to war?  Isn't there some unconscious / conscious satisfaction involved in
this?  Isn't there something to that?)

I'd rather be an uneducated loser than a murderer.

Conversely there are some people who feel like a nobody and join the
military to be somebody.  Have you seen the commerical where the recruit
comes back home and is talking to all of his buddies who are living a
civilian life, and he stares smugly back at them while he has war flashbacks
strobing through his mind?  Who does he think he is?

Do I think recruits are stupid?  I think they are morally suspect, carving
out their corporate future in blood.  But hey, they are being all they can
be.

I think it would be interesting if the military recruited from our prison
system.  Why not send death row inmates off to fight the war?  They already
have a heightened killer instinct, and if they are killed in action, then
there is no loss of innocent life.  The judicial system is unreliable, so
let's just send the people who were convicted on DNA evidence.  Why not?

The difference between a marine, a suicide bomber, and a terrorist is what
you call it.

One country's terroist is another country's freedom fighter.

The point of the O'Reilly end of it was to show what an outrage it is
in his view to use a book titled "The Five Lies Bush Told Us About
Iraq" for any purpose in any classroom. The segment is titled
"Outrage of the Week", after all. O'Reilly's job is to present as
unamerican flimflam any view other than his own because that's what
his viewers enjoy for entertainment. Why don't the liberals and
progressives who appear on his show simply read Franken's book "Lies
and the Lying Liars" about O'Reilly's false claims to have won a
Peabody Award and a number of others, and refuse to talk about
whatever O'Reilly wants to talk about in favor of talking about
O'Reilly's lies? Of course they wouldn't get invited back, and the
segment might not air at all, but at least they wouldn't be setting
themselves up for O'Reilly's brand of "when are you going to stop
beating your wife?" questions.

I like your points here Jim....I don't know if anybody can really get
to the bottom of the issue. Sometimes it's tempting to
imagine some kind of conspracy that is telling of 'national
character' from such differences in language. To what extent do some
very basic differences of language between languages cause people who
are raised speaking that language to perceive the world differently.....
And, even within the shared Euro-alphabets with which David'
original question is concerned...
So, some related issues for me, would be the words "OWE" and "OWN"--
In late 16c English texts, the word "owe" means what it means today,
but it also means "OWN"----this could lead one to believe that
ATTITUDES TO POSSESSION AND OWNERSHIP were not yet as reified as they
later became,
and that a lot of issues about "ownership" that today are often
"assumed"--
such as  "one can own the land" etc---were not as clearly assumed,
because the alternative was encoded into the everyday language.
Yet, I don't know if this is simply an interesting "cocktail party
tidbit"
or if one should give it much socio-political weight.    What do you
all think?

Like, in contemporary usage, how important is it that
English say "I am thirsty" and Spanish say "I HAVE THIRST"
Or what would be the significance that the word
for LIBRARY in English is the word for Bookstore in French
(and the word for bookstore in English is the word for Library in
French)--
Would asking HOW DID THIS HAPPEN (in translating)? be as useful as a
question,
as what consequences this would have about differing sense of ownership
and possession, and how the apostrophe plays a role in this....

Then there was the literary use of the apostrophe to cram in more
syllables to fit meter---
like "From's"-----which means "From us"----but often Shakespearean
actors today
will say it like "FROMS"---a very interesting sounding word....

"I'm 18, I don't know what I want"--Alice Cooper.
(that's one thing that was true for many in the vietnam generation as
well as today....)
.....or one could add "but I know how to get it"---Johnny Rotten

some know what they DON'T want...and that's a start

or some do know what they want, or think they know what they want...
alot of people, regardless of whether they choose the army or to go
to nursing school,
or whatever....
come to regret the consequences of decisions they made when they were
18...

some people have a very good education, or are very smart without the
benefit
of what somebody like Kerry calls a good education,
and still have limited options due to the economy...

some people, yes, just wanna see some action...

when older people judge 18 year old people,
18 year old people are also judging older people...
i don't know if there are many 18-22 year-olds on this list, but

(okay, i won't say more now--though this could in part at least address
the question asked (perhaps merely rhetorically by Thomas Savage),
"And what does it have to do with the writing to
> which this site is dedicated, anyway?"

I don't know if the singular presence of the
apostrophe in the English language has significant
cultural causes or effects (though it's indeed
something I've wondered about).

The present-day contagion of careless apostrophe's
(sic) is perhaps a meaningful phenomenon?  It's
sometimes called "shopkeeper's apostrophe" or
"greengrocer's apostrophe" because of the penchant of
some such businesspersons to put up signs advertising
"apple's" or "pear's".  But if, as many lament, this
sort of apostrophizing has spread like wildfire in
casual written English, could this be because
possession has become 9/10s (9/10's?) of present-day
experience?

 >>One country's terroist is another country's freedom fighter.

[tugging at sleeve] But you can only be in any one country
at a time ... unless you're always running away. So is it
terrorist or freedom fighter where you are?

Plus there are plenty of differences between terrorists
(including self-proclaimed freedom fighters who use
terrorist means) and freedom fighters (whose principle goal
is revolution and not chaos). If you're in a room with a guy
getting his head sawed off for TV, you probably know you're
not dealing with freedom fighters. If the guy next to you is
a sunstruck madmen ranting about his Mesopotamian sky god,
and he puts on a girdle made of C4 and nails, and heads for
a school or a hospital ... you probably weren't standing
next to a freedom fighter. Not in any conventional sense of
the word "freedom."

hold back the note, bend it, shape it, and then release it. And what you
don’t play is as important as what you do say.”-/
Robert Creeley

Steve Swallow’s /So There/ is a recording that began as a collaboration
with Robert Creeley and became an /homage/ to the great American poet,
who died in 2005 - before the project’s completion. It is more than a
“jazz and poetry” disc. The structure of Swallow’s music derives from
the structure of Creeley’s verse, and its rhythms are related to
Creeley’s readings of his work. “I tried to get inside Bob’s breathing
as he spoke the lines. Paradoxically, I think this has resulted in my
most heartfelt and personal music.” A finely-focused amalgamation of
words and music, with exceptional writing for string quartet, it also
leaves expressive freedom for Swallow himself as soloist and for pianist
Steve Kuhn, who gives one of the most comprehensive performances of his
career. Both words and music trigger powerful associations, new layers
of meanings opening with each listening.

Steve Swallow was immediately taken with Robert Creeley’s writing in the
late 50s on encountering it in Donald Allen’s anthology /The New
American Poetry/, a book which examined the work of young poets then
challenging literary orthodoxy, the new line taking its impetus from the
innovations of Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams and Louis
Zukofsky. Already then, the clarity and the succinctness of Creeley’s
poems made them stand out. Swallow first tried to put some of them to
music in the early 1960s, but it was not until the late 1970s that he
set a group of the poems, recording them on the ECM album /Home /with
Steve Kuhn, Lyle Mays, Dave Liebman and singer Sheila Jordan.

Cheers,
My first ever e-mail to the famous Poetics list:

Does anyone know the source of the Creeley remark quoted below?:
* */“Writing is the same as music. It’s in how you phrase it, how you
hold back the note, bend it, shape it, and then release it. And what you
don’t play is as important as what you do say.”-/
Robert Creeley

And--does anyone know the recordings Michael Gizzi compared to Creeley's
poetry at Buffalo this month?  (Perhaps I should just write to him.)  My
dissertation is on aurality, orality and prosody among the Black
Mountain writers, so any more info on the recent Buffalo talks would be
very helpful.

Best,
Seth Forrest

I wasn't up to carefully reading the article brought
up to check, but I always assumed the use of an
apostrophe to show a noun or pronoun to be in the
possessive case resulted from the habit of showing the
possessive case with the noun or pronoun involved plus
"his," as in "John his son David."  The "his" got
slurred, and the apostrophe slipped in by printers to
indicate that it was missing.

A while back, I asked the list if anyone knew the text
of Gretrude Stein's "INCLINE."  No response, but in
case anyone cares, I finally found it:

       Clinch, melody, hurry, spoon, special, dumb,
       cake, forrester, fine, cane, carpet, incline,
       spread, gate, light, labor.

Ric Royer is from Baltimore, touring on a new book and CD. He tours
regularly as a performance lecturer for the Performance Thanatology Research
Society, a group dedicated to the advancement of higher histrionics since
1999. He wants to talk to you about something. It has to do with fear. Come
closer, this part he must be whispered. It's about us. Although you may be
inclined tobelieve him, do not do so. He is lying, but he tries to do so
gracefully, so what you decline him in trust, please indulge him in
sympathy. Say to him, "I do not trust you, but I sympathize with you." He
will appreciate that, and it will be just enough for him to move on to the
next performance, the next stage. When he is speaking, he is speaking about
love, death and the future.He has many theories. He has many songs and
dances to accompany these theories. He is a lecturer, a philosopher, a song
and dance man. There is a good chance that he may scream, but do not take it
personally, he's just trying to feel something, just trying to "work it
out". A CV and many of his words and works can be found on his website at
www.ricroyer.com

I am interested in finding any connections that have
been drawn between Glossolalia and American Poetry.
But, unfortunately, I am at a lost for specific
examples of poetry or poetry criticism that directly
relates to this largely religious, semantically
meaningless, mystical language.  Can anyone help?

think of youtube as a database of oral histories and art
think of it as a dynamic archive.
a dynamic archive that is easily accessible on computer and mobile computerphone.
a dynamic self-producing ever expanding archive.

now think about where the literary archives sit and think of them as data bases and ask are the traditional information and knowledge bases of the humanities being accessed actively?
no they are relatively static
shouldn't we be making our databases in tha arts just as attractive and easy to use and contribute?

feel free to add your poetry to the youtube website.
do it for humanity, ha ha.

Oops, I forgot to save the link.  Do you have it,

I didn't find it too persuasive, but didn't give it
much chance.

Nick,

-- specifically with regard to Glossolalia and the charismatic forms of
Christianity in the US, i dunno, but there is work on the relationship
between religious mysticism and poetry in many different world religions --
perhaps that's too broad for the student's interests, but it would make
sense to at least look in that area to set the American movements in context
-- in these cases you get theologians or religious scholars dealing with
poetic texts

-- for social science type data on american religions, here is a useful
archive

(this is esp thinking of miekal and and his neologisms dictionary--) regarding gloosolalia and poetry--the Russian Futurists' Zaum (tran-rational) Poetry esp in the case of Alexei Kruchonyhk was influenced by glossolalia in Russian Church-- in American poetry it may be worth looking into work of many visual/sound poets-- one example i can give of a "mystical" text is "Zeropoem" (published by Traverse) on line visual text at first archive, the last 14 images http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com the sound recording of this is at: http://www.xexoxial.org/fluxuations/initiation.html the mysticl indicated by spoken coda uniting words from whitman and dickinson: "voice goes after/waht eyes can't reach/to close the eyes is travel"

The Poet=92s Biography

=20

Sub: The biography of Nadia Anjoman, the respected poet of =
Herat-Afghanistan


         and a victim of family violence on 5th Nov., 2005

By:   M. Shafie Noorzaei, her brother, lecturer at Herat University=20

        (edited by Ren Powell)

=20

Date: Jan 23, 2006

=20

On the 27th of December, 1980 my parents=92 sixth child was born. They =
named
her Nadia. As far back as I can remember my parents talked about how the
birth of this baby girl enriched our lives. They said she was a =
harbinger of
fortune for my father and his family.=20

=20

Even as a child, Nadia was clever and intelligent. I remember how, when =
we
were young, she would jump on the stairs at our house. She used to ask =
me to
join her, but being two years her senior, I didn=92t understand why she
enjoyed it so much. Then again, maybe it wasn=92t my age that was the
problem=97perhaps I didn=92t share her unique sensitivity.=20

=20

When we began elementary school, Nadia and I were in the same class. At =
that
time Nadia was only five years old, but we were both good students. The =
two
of us were classmates until we reached the fourth grade=97when the boys =
and
girls were separated for their continued studies. Our parents were very
supportive when it came to our education; they were our most important
teachers.=20

=20

Once when she was in the fifth grade Nadia came home from school in =
tears.
When my mother asked her what the matter was Nadia said, =93It=92s not =
fair. My
history teacher lowered my grade because I=92m younger than the rest of =
the
students, even though I answered all the questions correctly! And then =
he
raised the grade of one of the lazy boys in the class=97the one who is =
his
nephew.=94

=20

Until that day, I=92d never seen Nadia=92s serious side. My mother tried =
to
cheer her up and promised to go to the school the next day to ask about =
the
matter, but that night Nadia was filled with anxiety. That night marked =
the
blossoming of her poetic nature.=20

=20

At school the next day, in front the Headmaster, Nadia read aloud the =
first
poem she=92d ever written. The poem was about the grading incident of =
the day
before. The Headmaster immediately recognized Nadia=92s talent, and he =
also
confronted her history teacher about the grading incident. This was all =
the
motivation Nadia needed to write more poems. From then on Nadia read her
poetry at all of the school=92s ceremonies. Her classmates were proud of =
her,
and her teachers were supportive and encouraging.=20

=20

Nadia=92s parents were also respectful and supportive of her talent. She =
was
adored by her brothers and sisters=97her mild temperament made her a =
beloved
friend and companion. Our family was close and we solved our problems by
always working together.=20

=20

=20

Nadia was in the 10th grade when the Taliban began governing the city of
Herat. The officials sent her home and the gates of the girls=92 schools =
were
closed. Nadia, however, did not stop writing poetry. She studied
independently. I remember her in the kitchen, cooking, but with an open =
book
in front of her. The small radio my father bought for her was also =
always
nearby. During the dark times of the Taliban, while all of the youth =
were
caught up in Indian films and music, there being nothing else by way of
entertainment or recreation, Nadia was listening to the BBC. She =
especially
liked the midday and cultural programs. And at midnight, when we were =
all
sleeping, she would perform a private ceremony with paper and pen: =
composing
her thoughts and ideas within the new and old frameworks of Dari poetry. =


=20

And yet, even during this time of hopelessness and isolation for the =
girls,
Nadia=92s greatest wish had been fulfilled when she was introduced to =
the head
of the literature faculty at Herat University Mr. M. Naser Rahyab.=20

=20

At that time, women and girls were not allowed to leave their homes and
Nadia had been very brave to go to Mr. Rahyab=92s house for his =
tutelage. His
mentoring helped her to give her poems more meaning, color and strength.
Even during the six years of the Taliban state, Nadia had never been far
from sources of knowledge and art.=20

=20

When I speak of art, I am referring the Nadia=92s ability to sew. She =
was an
excellent seamstress and sewed clothing for herself, our mother, her =
sisters
and other relatives, too. She did this while studying Hafiz Shirazi, =
Saadi,
Mehdi Sohaily, Parvin Eitasami, Forough Faokhzad, Bidil Dehlawi, Mowlana =
e
Balkhi and other traditional and contemporary writers of Dari =
literature,
the poet and the novelists. Nadia also wrote criticism and helped =
students
revise their work through the Herat Authors Association. I should also
mention that, during those years, Nadia had also traveled once to =
Pakistan
with my father and brother.

=20

When the Taliban rule ended in 2001, the doors of the girls=92 schools =
were
opened once again and Nadia was found a new life. At that time she was
registered for the entrance examination for the university, thanks to an
order from the Ministry of Education. After passing the examination she =
was
admitted as a student of her preferred subject=97she was admitted to the
Literature Department of Herat University, in Dari. This accomplishment
empowered Nadia. I remember that time as being the happiest of Nadia=92s =
life;
it seemed as though she=92d been handed the whole world.=20

=20

Although Nadia was too young to marry, many families came to our house =
with
proposals. Through my mother, Nadia refused them all. She said that she
never wanted to marry, that marriage would be a barrier to her career =
and to
her development as a writer.=20

=20

In Nadia=92s first year of university studies, Mr. Farid Ahmad Maiid =
Neia, one
of the administrators in the department of Literature sent our mother a
branch of flowers to announce his intentions as Nadia=92s suitor. As was =
her
pattern, she refused his proposal, too. .More flowers were sent, but =
Nadia
had made her decision.=20

=20

During the last seven semesters of her university studies, Nadia was top =
of
her class=97just as it had been in the girls=92 school. Although I was =
already
teaching at the university and Nadia was only a student, I was very =
proud of
her. She steadily accumulated successes and honors like university
scholarships and fellowships.=20

=20

During her third year as an undergraduate Nadia traveled with ten =
teachers
and other female students to visit the cultural centers, historic sites =
and
universities in Iran. There Nadia met many Iranian poets, writers and
authors, and she exchanged ideas and experiences with them. In Iran, =
Nadia
had been able to visit the world-renown professor and philosopher Dr. =
Hosain
Elahi Qomshaei, who praised and encouraged her. Nadia brought back many =
good
memories from the trip.=20

=20

Nadia=92s manners and temperament were outstanding, and her smile, =
always on
her lips, was irresistible. Nadia got along well with everyone; she was =
a
child with children, youthful with teenagers, and mature with her =
elders.
She respected her elders and they appreciated her humility and =
selflessness,
her lack of envy=97all traits they found lacking in Nadia=92s =
contemporaries. If
Nadia called attention to a person=92s faults, she did so with good =
intentions
and she did so kindly. Nadia was not a woman to wear expensive clothes =
or
jewelry. She was a true advocate for children and was always kind. When =
the
children would bombard her at the markets and bazaars, she would always =
buy
something from them, not out of need, but out of a desire to make the
children happy. Although there were no children in our home, the =
neighbor
children came to the house every day to visit Nadia. These visits were a
testimony to her loving nature.=20

=20

It was during Nadia=92s third year of university study that Mr. Majid =
Neia
began a second round of proposals. He had been suppressing his feelings =
for
Nadia for three years and would no longer keep them to himself. He =
refused
to give up this time. Though Nadia tried to avoid an obligation to him, =
when
sent the Holy Quran to her she could not refuse. He=92d used the Holy =
Quran to
place a barrier before her.=20

=20

Nadia had no choice to but to give in and accept the marriage proposal. =
I
will never forget the day we gave them their answer: Yes. Tears never =
left
her innocent eyes and Nadia kept repeating, =93It=92s a pity. I will =
waste away
for his sake. I do not deserve this.=94 But we tried to help her keep up =
her
courage.=20

=20

From that day on, Nadia often appeared to be happy, but it was only an
appearance. The engagement lasted six months, after which they were =
married
in a simple wedding ceremony. After that Nadia found herself looking at =
life
from a completely different position. She smiled, but whether we knew it =
or
not, her smile was false.

=20

Nadia had always been a girl with an enormous amount of patience and a =
great
heart. She was always optimistic woman who would not let her husband or =
her
mother-in-law=92s faults discourage her. Sometimes Nadia would confide =
in our
mother, telling her about the name-calling and ill treatment she =
received
from her mother-in-law. But Nadia didn=92t tell our father; our father =
was old
and ill and Nadia didn=92t want to distress him.=20

=20

Nadia=92s mother-in-law was a selfish, old woman who told her, just two =
days
after the wedding, =93I will never love you=94. Nadia was never allowed =
to make
decision in the household. =93This house is my property. Farid is the =
one who
has brought you here and he=92s the one who will have to find a =
different
place for you.=94 But Farid refused to intercede on Nadia=92s behalf. He
thought, =93This is my mother and she will only be around for a few more
days.=94

=20

My mother advised Nadia to be patient, =93Every marriage has problems at =
the
beginning. They will pass soon. Your mother-in-law only has one son, you
understand.=94 Nadia had no choice but to be patient. There were only =
three
people in that house: Farid, his mother and Nadia. Then Nadia gave birth =
to
the innocent child Bahram Saeid. Nadia was in the middle of her finale =
year
of studies when he was born. Bahram Saeid was good natured and =
naughty=97a
noisy, wonderful boy who was very much loved by his mother.=20

=20

Bahram Saeid=92s paternal grandmother never touched him, nor would she =
allow
Farid to pick him up. Although the woman never showed any kindness or =
love
toward Nadia=92s child, Nadia tried not to let it bother her. She often =
left
her son in our mother=92s care during the days when she went to the
university. When I talked to her about the seriousness of the situation =
with
her mother-in-law, she would silence me by saying things like, =93It=92s =
not a
problem.=94; =93It=92s nothing to worry about.=94; =93I am used to =
it.=94; or =93Life is a
struggle.=94 Nadia was afraid of causing sorrow or grief for our =
parents. She
didn=92t want to worry the family. Whenever Nadia would visit our home =
she
showered everyone with praise, sharing her vivacity and happiness with =
us.

=20

It wasn=92t long ago that Nadia spent a great deal of time talking to me =
about
my own marriage. She had selected several young women from among the
university students, our relatives, our neighbors and her friends as
possible wives. The last time I saw her was the 5th of November, the =
third
day of Eid; it was the day of her death.=20

=20

I surprised her at her house at 2:05 p.m. I rarely went to her house and =
she
was very happy to see me. She was alone, waiting for her husband to =
arrive.
Farid was going to take her to a relative=92s house and then to the =
house of a
close friend who had recently lost her father. It is a custom in
Afghanistan, when someone dies, for people to gather at his or her house =
on
the third day of Eid following the death.=20

=20

Nadia served me a piece of the cake she had made for the Eid =
celebration. It
was delicious. We talked for an hour=97one of the most pleasant talks I =
think
we ever had. And we watched part of an Iranian documentary on Iran TV. =
While
we were talking she told me about two of the young women she wanted me =
to
consider marrying. She showed me their pictures from her album. Then we
watched the film of her own wedding so she could point them out. We =
talked a
lot about her friends.=20

=20

During the entire visit Bahram Saeid was by my side. He was five months =
old
and had just learned to sit up. As I was leaving, he reached for me as I
stood in the doorway. Nadia told me that her son understood that I was =
his
family, his uncle, and that he was reaching out to me so I=92d take him =
with
me on the motorcycle. I said goodbye and was leaving for my friend=92s =
house
to celebrate Eid when I saw Faid heading home.=20

At 00:05 that night, when we were sleeping, the phone rang. Someone was
calling from the hospital=92s emergency room: =93Do you know Nadia? She =
has
died. Please come to the hospital as soon as possible.=94=20

=20

It was the bitterest news we had ever received. No one could believe it.
That night was a hundred times darker than other nights. The moon had =
been
veiled and Nadia=92s life had been extinguished! We rushed the hospital. =
We
were crying. We saw Nadia lying dead on a bed in the emergency room! =
Farid
was restless and weeping. When we asked him how Nadia had died, he said, =
=93We
argued while on the way to Nadia=92s friend=92s house and, finally, I =
slapped
her.=94=20

=20

By the next day, the sixth of December, everyone in the city of Herat =
had
heard the terrible news. People came to our house in tears, offering =
their
condolences=97there were university professors, teachers, students,
colleagues, prominent people in the arts milieu, scholars, authors,
journalists, relatives and friends.=20

=20

Nadia was buried amidst an aura of tragedy; the light rain fell like =
tears
in the holy cemetery in north-east Herat. In the days that followed =
tributes
appeared in all the publications. Nadia=92s poetry, talent, character =
and
personality were praised. Interviews appeared in the media, round table
discussions and scholarly dissections of her tragic fate. Many people =
still
come to our house to bless Nadia, but to what end? Nadia has left this
horrible world forever.=20

Philosophy and Others of Dance, numerous pieces, feedback welcomed


Prolog:

Maud-enunciation of avatars, pre-duet: the occupation of virtual space -
sad pirouette sad dancer lonely dancer left behind magic wand paper stars
in paper skies tiny bows and pas http://www.asondheim.org/maudatar.mp4
d'une d'une, I will hide your tiny little URL, almost so real - When the
Role disappears from dance, dance is.

When the dancer disappears, when position and momentum disappear, when
energy and space disappear, when many and one disappear; when eidetic
reduction and the phenomenological stance are flattened, historicized,
demarcated, incapable of reproduction, incapable of recuperation; the
accumulation of the symbolic, dance is disappearance, no longer imminent,
immanent: then paste, defuge, tumescent shuddering of the real. Then
nothing of the real. Then "annihilation to the limit" which is nothing.
Which is nothing at all.

Paragraphs and Chapters:

Below: "dance is" - dance philosophy, not philosophy of dance. Short
analysis and explanation of the dance series in relation to the
virtual/real, analog/digital, and governance/community. There are five
dance-is to date: Foofwa*2, Alan, Maud, Tom where it all started.
http://www.asondheim.org/alandanceis.mp3

I always wonder about dance, participating in choreography or mise-en-
scene, or compositeur, even a bit of movement; I can't dance, am awkward
and far too nervous; I admire dancers but there are very few I relate to.
Foofwa's work is close to performance, sport, theory. But it's a question
of the Sign - which is always already mute; in writing, sign is signifying
- assignation. Dance reads, constructs, deconstructs the world; this is
also a characteristic of culture in general. Dance begins and ends with
the consciousness of the body; why wear clothes? Use props? Why work for
that matter within the institution of the theater? Writing and the gospel
truth - http://www.asondheim.org/mercigrotto.mp4

There is the gospel of dance, its history, which is something else, as in
photography or any other cultural form in these thick times - it's over-
determined, obstructive, overly cognizant of cultural form, of modes of
distribution, of theatrical and terpsichorean politics, of master-disciple
relationships, of the aporia of the knotted student.

There's the gospel of the virtual, its imaginary, elsewhere, as in the
shamanic or production of images in these exfoliated times - it's overtly
misrecognized, smoothed, the incipient production of culture, telecommun-
ications, any moment of being, of absenting relationship, but of techno-
logical construct as well. And of the real, of which the less or more said
the better or the worse. http://www.asondheim.org/virtualreal.mp4

[[ sed 's/writing/real/g' < The real dances around dance; writing dances
around the real; the real dances around writing; etc. sed 's/dance/X/g'
The real Xs around X; writing Xs around the real; the real Xs around
writing; etc. < analog < digital < etc. > sed 's/real/written/g' etc. |
sed 's/real/"real"/g' | sed 's/real/X/g' -> "X" < digital == analog >
faunal cultural history < inscription < digital ]]

[[ X* ]] perhaps another term than dance, for how should definition
function here? Or perhaps neither performance nor the body. One is left
with abjection, the sublime, real/imaginary; let us call this the "abject
sublime." For we are within this era, this positioning, dulled, imploded,
decathetcted, exhausted, condition of defuge. If defuge relates to
depression, then defuge relates to the real in a manner of none other,
nothing else. And if we do not think dance, we do not think culture, we
begin to think.

Two sound pieces in prealpine church of Pringy (chromatic and 'Weekender'
harmonicas) - http://www.asondheim.org/charmchurch.mp3 - within which the
church signifies the tumescence of the resonator.

Mark,

the link you posted raises the question, for me, of whether an emerging
writer is the property of the gossip about them, or whether the gossip, as
property of the community in some sense, is a totally unrelated thing --
where the possessives would go in that case -- certainly no woman is the
property of rumors unless she deliberately chooses to be -- and then her
choices can take a "cafeteria approach" to what is rumored -- in no way does
rumor need to dictate anything -- regardless of its truth or falsity -- to
say so would be to set women back decades, and more -- thank you for posting
this piece because it's thought provoking -- this may be a "small town" mind
in its regard, but it is kind of freeing to think of rumor in terms of
possessives, and where they would be placed -- and then the other option,
which is that rumor not be claimed or placed at all -- in philosophical
terms its interesting -- no one owns it, no one need own it -- others of you
who know more about these things might have other ideas -- i personally like
a detached approach, a refusal to make claims -- but then i'm a few cups of
coffee short of feeling on top of the subject in analytical terms

regards,

heidi

Hi everyone - if you'd like your book reviewed on ebr, it's best to
email me with suggestions for smart/reliable people to write the
review (unfortunately I often have trouble finding people to do the
writing).  I'll then get in touch with the potential reviewer with
submission guidelines (in the url that Herb sent out) and arrange for
a copy to be sent to off.

best, Lori

Glosolalia features in sound poetry criticism.  Sound poet and
medical historian Vincent Barras has pursued connections between
glossolalia and poetry for sometime, in both his creative and
critical work.  In French, there's his article "Glossolalies?  La
Glotte Y Sonne Un Hallali!," (Glossolalias?  The Glottis Sounds the
Kill!) which appeared in the Swiss-French journal Equinoxe (no 14,
Autumn 1995).  He's also is included in Writing Aloud: The Sonics of
Language, an anthology edited by Brandon LaBelle & Christof Migone.

Best,

Support?! How dare the poor cavemen seek assistance deciphering 19th century
scribblings! They should be reading -- and, certainly, understanding -- the
brilliant poetical contraptions of contemporary geniuses (geniuses = anyone
on BuffPo with "innovative" new chapbook).

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present the 2nd of our
Predecessors Talks: Elizabeth Arnold on Rhyme & Politics in Oppen, Niedecker,
& Loy
Friday, November 10, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Elizabeth Arnold writes: “In a talk I gave on rhyme in free verse, the focus
was, naturally, on the music of the language, the lyricism of the poems I
chose. And yet, several people in the audience were surprised to find that, in
addition to being compelling aurally, so many of the poems were political.
Included among them were some poems by George Oppen. Oppen’s adherence in
particular to what Wallace Stevens of all people insists upon: the necessary
interaction of reality and imagination. Social realism did not allow for the
unanticipatable emergence of ideas and feelings in a poem; as a committed
Marxist, Oppen chose not to write for twenty-five years rather than compromise
his art. Lyric power was crucial to him, the ear being necessary to the
success of poems carrying, out of the deepest recesses of a man who lived what
he believed, lyric poems with political subject matter. I may also look at
poems by Lorine Niedecker and Mina Loy in this light.”

Elizabeth Arnold is the author of two books of poems, Civilization (Flood
Editions, 2006) and The Reef (University of Chicago Press, 1999). The
recipient of a Bunting fellowship and a Whiting award, she edited Mina Loy’s
Insel for Black Sparrow Press and teaches in the MFA programs at the
University of Maryland and Warren Wilson College. She lives outside
Washington, D.C.


SPT's Predecessors Talks series exists to map and illuminate continuities of
influence and impetus among writers of a range of eras and milieux.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the
intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

My little ol blog is getting twice the number of hits these days - I think
the Google vacuum cleaner now has a much bigger set of brushes (claws!).
About two years ago - in a note about going to the September Columbia
Zukofsky conference (which was close to the 2004 Presidential elections)  i=
n
the final paragraph, to honor the season, I offered the rumor that Laura
Bush was filing for divorce from George - with some suggestion that we migh=
t
also follow suit in the polling booth

This 'divorce'  was not even in the post's subject heading. But apparently
there's a 'hot' such divorce rumor in some recent national tabloid and this
ancient post - via Google -  has been getting a zillion hits.

The good news is that all these paparazzi chasers are probably hearing Loui=
s
Zukofsky's name for the first time, and maybe that will also put Z into a
"searchbot" and, who knows, maybe that will lead folks to a Zukofsky site,
etc. etc!  Occasionally one of these folks sticks around my site for a
minute!=20

Which is to say, miekal, you are right to point out the multiple character
of blog and website visits - of which I am sure Ron is aware.

Is there a "poetrybot"? I kind of hope not.

I work as a webmaster and "unique" visits with all bots subtracted is =20=

really the only kind of relevant number.  Most of the blogs & cms's =20

then if you look at unique visits rather than visits, the numbers =20
become drastically smaller.

It's one of my American Book Review pieces, a
discussion at
http://comprepoetica.com/newblog/Index.html of poetry
and the Internet with a focus on Duration, a huge
poetry website.  I'd very much appreciate feedback

Yup.  The "his" form seems to be an example of folk-orthography, and the
apostrophe itself a signal/vestige of the original Old English
fully-stressed "-es" possessive case word-ending.  Shouldn't be difficult to
check, by locating the earliest use of the "his" form vs. the comma-ed
apostrophe.  I have to say this was my own sense, and nice to see this
"confirmed".  Though I'd have liked to see more dated citations given rather
than just references to secondary sources.  [Note how the article says Hook
(1999) "maintains" -- a hint of uncertainty there?]

Worth stressing that the apostrophe *only exists in the written form of
English -- "its" and "it's" are pronounced identically.  (M.A.K.Halliday,
+The Spoken and the Written Language+, to give a fine book a boost, is
relevant here.  Let's hear it for Maoist linguists now residing in
Australia.)

        Robin

From the article (to save Bob Grumman's pore tired brain <g>):

"
Hook (1999) maintains, however, that the apostrophe is "a mere printer's
gimmick, doubtless born of the mistaken notion that the genitive ending was
a contraction of his"

        (p. 44). An invention of mortals, the apostrophe has indeed been
subject to human error.

The -es genitive ending, often spelled and pronounced -ies or -ys in early
Middle English, was confused as early as the thirteenth century with his,
the possessive of he, so that Shakespeare could later write 'the count his
gally', and even expressions like 'my sister her watch' appeared (qtd. in
Hook, 1999, pp. 44-45).

The unstressed pronunciation of the genitive -es seemed to have caused many
speakers to believe they were saying his. This usage presumably caused
pronunciation problems and gender confusion with a noun such as woman or
girl, or a plural noun like
winners, but nevertheless was quite common (Hook, 1975, p.160). The
apostrophe became a sort of "compromise" to indicate either the missing -e
in the genitive ending -es, or the hi of the mistaken possessive indicator
his (Hook, 1999, p. 45).

Palm Press is pleased to announce publication of Dana Teen Lomax's debut =
collection, Curren=A2y.

"Dana Teen Lomax's work navigates the vexed relations of life behind the =
bars of the $$, where gender, race, and class are not merely =
"discourses"  but lived vectors of experience, and where the logic of =
exchange value mediates that experience to the point where "the $u$pen$e =
i$ in the death toll$." Curren=A2y is nothing less than an oppositional =
archeology of consumer culture as it reproduces its logics on and in our =
bodies-both personal and body-political-against a field of possibilities =
increasingly threatened by the privatization and colonization of the =
life-world. Writing a radical biopolitics-a "biopoethics"-would be that =
practice that articulates itself in resistant song, and, that in Lomax's =
expanded field, of necessity also dances, in paroxysms full of both rage =
and desire."--David Buuck=20

Dana Teen Lomax is a fourth generation Californian who teaches poetry =

(a+bend press) was awarded the Joseph Henry Jackson Prize for poetry and =
her writing has been supported by the California Arts Council, the =
Peninsula Community Foundation, the Academy of American Poets and =
others. She is co-editing Letters to Poets: Conversations About Poetics, =
Politics and Community and making Q, a series of home movies about =
raising her daughter on the grounds of a prison. She lives with her =
family in northern California.

deploy, he said, the devouring powers of light


all natural languages have precisely the same degree of complexity.
'destroy, she said', 'primitive, he said', 'enjoy, he said', 'deploy,
she said.'
to deconstruct is neither to analyze nor to take apart.
http://www.asondheim.org/eatenbylight.mp4
you can't argue with an aphorism.
'code' is more than structure, structure is more than substructure,
substructure is more than equivalence, organism is less than code.
throw out everything you know about animal behavior and culture;
humans are just beginning to discover civilization.
our knowledge is not our own.
humans construct the only deliberate, calculated, and universal
slaughter-house.
everything an enemy, every enemy a thing.
take the man from the woman and kill him.
binary oppositions replace cultural capital with economic capital.
there are dozens of types of war and at any time we are engaged
in at least a quarter of them.
do not ask for whom the bell tolls; ask who made the bell.
an aphorism makes the man.
reality is imaginary's monotonic.
or the romanticism of the real is the classicism of the imaginary.
projection kills and introjection devours.
or introjection suppurates and projection wounds.
murder is wild war.
if i want a word with you, the word i want is 'you.'
give away your sex and there goes your reputation.
give away your reputation and here comes your sex.
public masturbation constructs the truth of the real for audience and
masturbater alike.
faunal extinction takes humans home.
sex kills and slaughter entertains.
eroticism is the neocon of sexual war.
the aphoristic is the final refuge of the defeated.
aphorisms are always otherwise.

devouring waters of li(f)(gh)t

colonized by light
light = colonization of invisible matter
invisible matter = universal organism
organism = colonialization
colony = territorialization
release the light! deterritorialize!

http://www.asondheim.org/eatenbylight.mp4

dancer: Filibert Tologo
stage: la Salle des Eaux-Vives, Geneve

throw out everything we know about the future of the human race:
there isn't any, anything recognizable.
throw out everything we know about animal behaviour and culture:
we're blind and will remain so, driving species to extinction.

these are the truths brought to us by dance and culture:
dance and culture brings Signs from Worlds eaten by light.
dance and culture have no territory:
Worlds disappear, tethered to exhausted Signs.

*/
At first I thought this period is the end of prehistory, that history only
begins with the definitive event of the large-scale disappearance of hu-
mans across an earth ruined by nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare.
The future of history is hyperhistory; all other histories meander through
fractured sememes destined to disappear.

Then I thought this period is the beginning of prehistory, towards the
potential of the mute, the moot point, the unacknowledged pivot or hinge,
the elimination of all evidence of the pivot, which after all is spread
across space and time, reaching far behind us for example, extending far
ahead of us for example. This prehistory may be followed by nothing in
terms of familiar inscription; it may be followed by a superfluity of
familiar inscription; it may be all or nothing, open or closed.

But whether or not this is the end or beginning of prehistory, it is the
continuation of the brute, inert, violence of our existence, scabbing and
devouring beyond the carrying-capacity of the earth - it is the continua-
tion or the end of our existence, the violence itself carrying-on, residue
far beyond lifespans, half-lifespans, sintering of the remnants of debris.

 >>I did--I thought the answer was a, the setting (the
narrator's psyche)

I thought it could be a hypertextual parting of the ways.
Pressing A, B, or C would lead to a customized set of
questions targeted to you, who were classed either as a
setting-, point of view-, or attitude- "type" of reader.

If you're a setting type, you cannot read _Ulysses_ without
having a map of Dublin handy. If you're a point of view
reader, you'll want to foreground narrative techniques that
reinforce point of view, so you'll need a couple colored
highlighters to mark up hot and cold prose. If you're an
attitude reader, and you're in the right mood, you'll want
to act out Mersault's detachment or Emma's anxious
emptiness. Norton in its infinite kindness, and not in the
least to counterpoise the intellectual sweatshops that
produce its product, wants this to be a fun test. It's not
about the score. Literature is for all. Ahhhhhh!

aren't Norton anthologies sort of, I don't know, definitive editions of
the works they publish? maybe not definitive, but at least standardized?


now, you might complain about the standards, norms, etc., that are being
applied in choice and editorial approach, but isn't the anthologies'
existence kind of a good thing?=20

am I just a stooge for the canon pushers if I receive a certain pleasure
thumbing through a Norton anth. now and then?=20

so this boo-boo re: the Poe question doesn't on its own indicate that
their whole operation is corrupt and literarily bankrupt, does it?=20

by the way, as I scanned through Eric's message, I read this:=20

          "If you're setting type, you cannot read _Ulysses_=20
           without having a map of Dublin handy."

I couldn't figure how having a map of Dublin would help you to set type,
unless the type you're setting is for _Ulysses_ itself. or else having
the layout of Dublin open on your desk would give you a preconscious
stimulus, osmotically or something cool like that, while you create your
own text.

this kind of self-serving pseudo-good heartedness makes me really angry.

From the website:
"Poets in need is a non-profit organization founded in 2000 providing emergency assistance to poets who have an established presence in the literary community as innovators in the field and a substantive body of work."

that strikes me as saying if you're really needy, and not the kind of person who can pull down a cushy teaching job at some sleepy liberal arts college, or make a couple of grand here and there doing speaking engagements, or charge 15-20 bucks a copy for hard cover versions of your books, PIN doesn't give a damn how much you need help, because you don't deserve theirs. More importantly, such criteria for assistance effectively limits beneficiaries to people who are middle aged or older and college educated. In other words, the members of our society who really ought to be expected to be able to take care of themselves. Never mind what happens if Michael Rothenberg and co. don't happen to consider your work innovative.

What a bunch of bullshit. I'll send my donations to the salvation army or the united way, thanks.

As a friend of David Meltzer who knows what he's had to go through at
certain times in his life, I object strongly to Jason Quackenbush's
pissy little snit-fit (which I'm sure was ignited -- fizzle, fizzle --
before he even got as far as David Meltzer's testimonial.  Guess what,
dude?  David Meltzer does not possess a college degree.  He has
problems with mobility.  He's pushing 70.  He doesn't make very much
money at all.  And he's a great poet; though not a betting man, I'd
wager, Mr. Quackenbush, he has a lot more to say on a bad day than you
do on a good one.  You make "Michael Rothenberg and Co." sound like a
little mafia.  Well, guess what else, dude?  The Salvation Army is a
racket and so is the corporate, corruption-ridden United Way.  I'd
respect you more if you just gave that vaunted donation (but allow me
to doubt its existence on other than a rhetorical point-scoring plane)
to the first homeless person to cross your path.

The stink of bourgeois white-boy complacency that often emanates from
this list is at times too much to ignore, I'm afraid.

But to show I'm not devoid of charity, and to defuse his no doubt
righteous anger, all Mr. Quackenbush need do is send out his address
and I'll be glad to mail him a shiny brown penny (not for his
thoughts, mind you), with appropriate admonitions not to spend it all
in one place and on any kind of dissipation.

i actually took the poetry quiz; what i found was that some basic tenets for
norton were, in my mind, flawed.  (ie the singular, defining convention of
poetry being meter...which it isn't:  it is TROPE!)  i agree that the
premise of the anthology is great--collecting good work, cheaply, in one
place for students = fantastic.  teaching antiquated ideas, the kind ripped
apart by robin williams' character in "the dead poets society" is not so
grand.

poetry isn't definined by "visual language" but FIGURATIVE language, not
meter but TROPE, etc.  and, let's be clear, we can NEVER know the author's
or point of view (as was asked in the example question).

ok...polls close in 3.25 hours.  yay election day!

Today at http://comprepoetica.com/newblog/Index.html I
have a letter-to-the-editor that got into American

Yes,Christopher, thanks for illuminating the unfortunate, mean spiritedness
of Jason Q's misinformed tirade against the wishes and goals of PIN.
I happily contribute what I can to Poets-in-Need and - knowing some of them
each, and some well, the trustees - Lyn Hejinian, Michael Rothenberg, Leslie
Scalapino and Norman Fischer - I implicitly trust their intentions.
Ironically, only one, Lyn, and that is belatedly, works in the academy, and
they are each - through their own and experiences of others - deeply
familiar with the risks - health an all - of surviving at the margins
without sufficient health insurance, most notably.

I think its important to, if not celebrate, to support their generosity and
compassion towards poets of commitment and accomplishment who are genuinely
in need.

What would be the URL to the button?

Given that the entire top-level page consists of a single, very large GIF,
it's a little less than clear what one might display on a website or blog

No, I took my medications as prescribed today, thanks. Do you have a different point of view or is it just your opinion that I'm not entitled to a principle that elitist groups ought not to be providing financial assistance to the needy based not on an individual's need but rather on the perception by the group of the individual's worth?

Speaking of pseudo-good heartedness, you may want to pass on the Salvation
Army and the United Way.

A couple years back, the SA cut a deal to back the Bushies if they were
allowed to discriminate against gays. And the United Way is so tied into
large corporations that they have discriminated against "controversial"
programs such as a black-lung miner's fund.

Just thought I'd mention. Your mileage may, of course, vary, as may your
opinion.

Jason,

I think you have this all wrong. PIN has no paid staff. Everything runs on
donations, so nobody skims the money. There is no paid administration, no
rent, only volunteers.

I supported my own writing by monitoring nonprofit organizations for over 26
years & wouldn't give a cent to places like the Red Cross and many others
because I've seen them cook their books and routinely do disservices to the
needy. I have done quality control of United Way, which has its own history
of questionable financial issues, overpaid executives, etc. As a retired
professional, I can assure you that your dollar will be more effectively
utilized at Poets in Need where 100 cents per dollar goes to people, as
opposed to perhaps one cent per dollar, as happens in most organizations
(although the Salvation Army is pretty good).

I don't expect to need PIN's help, but I send them a check.

Michael Rothenberg is a person who is seriously committed, not just to his
craft, but to environmental and social issues. He really cares. You are
reading him way wrong.


The site does not say a single word that supports your response. I suggest
you look at the site.

I've used my two posts for the day. Michael Rothenberg's email is at the PIN
site.  If you really feel so strongly, perhaps you should discuss this with
him.

this kind of self-serving pseudo-good heartedness makes me really angry.

From the website:
"Poets in need is a non-profit organization founded in 2000 providing
emergency assistance to poets who have an established presence in the
literary community as innovators in the field and a substantive body of
work."

that strikes me as saying if you're really needy, and not the kind of person
who can pull down a cushy teaching job at some sleepy liberal arts college,
or make a couple of grand here and there doing speaking engagements, or
charge 15-20 bucks a copy for hard cover versions of your books, PIN doesn't
give a damn how much you need help, because you don't deserve theirs. More
importantly, such criteria for assistance effectively limits beneficiaries
to people who are middle aged or older and college educated. In other words,
the members of our society who really ought to be expected to be able to
take care of themselves. Never mind what happens if Michael Rothenberg and
co. don't happen to consider your work innovative.

What a bunch of bullshit. I'll send my donations to the salvation army or
the united way, thanks.

Jason, it seems that you are making a gesture of solidarity on behalf of
young people who might not qualify for Poets in Need benefits.

That's admirable, and I agree that something should be done for the young
people.  But what?  If you are serious about forming a young person's
Poets in Need sort of group, that would administer charity to those who
have not yet reached middle aged, let me know.  You might call it "Junior
Poets in Need"-- J-PIN?

I urge you not to divert your donations to the Salvation Army or United
Way, but keep with your original impulse and earmark them for J-PIN.  How
much were you planning to give the Salvation Army and United Way anyhow,
if that's not too impertinent?  How would you know that they those large
impersonal organizations had funneled your contributions to the young?

I was wondering when you'd join this discussion,
Robin, and am glad you have.  Thanks for the quoted
material.  I now lean toward two (or more) sources of
the apostrophe ess to indicate the possessive case.
It seems possible to me that something like "the count
his gally" could have become standard, with some
prnouncing it "the counts gally" and printers adding
apostrophes at the same time other printers were
adding apostrophes indicating removed genitive y's or
e's or whatever.  Or could the extra syllable in the
genitive have been lost by the time of printing?  In
that case, the apostrophe might only have come to be
used for the possessive case because of "his."

I'm talking through my hat, of course.  Don't know
anything about Englishes before Shakespeare's, or much
even about his.  Can't quite believe the his
hypothesis is all folkery, though.

Would love to read a book on the apostrophe.

yeah, get out there and vote all you U.S. listers!

I've never heard the "trope, not meter" position, but then I don't get
out much these days.=20

and I would agree with you, Angela, about "Dead Poets Society", but for
a recent book review in the Times that reminded me how stilted the movie
was when it came to showing "what poetry is really about":=20

---

NY Times * October 1, 2006 * School of Verse * By DAVID ORR
[reviewing] THE ODE LESS TRAVELLED -- Unlocking the Poet Within -- By
Stephen Fry.

The difficulty of teaching poetry to a lay audience can be summarized by
a single, diabolical name: Robin Williams. Williams, as you may recall,
played the free-thinking English teacher John Keating in the 1989 movie
"Dead Poets Society," a film that established once and for all the
connection between learning about poems and killing yourself while
wearing a silly hat. In the movie's first depiction of poetical
pedagogy, Williams as Keating instructs his students to open their
textbook - a dry, dully diagrammatic primer by "Dr. J. Evans-Pritchard"
- and then, with the insouciant panache of Lord Byron (or possibly Patch
Adams) tells them to rip out the introduction! Yes! Riiiip! "Armies of
academics going forward, measuring poetry," cries the righteous Keating,
"No, we will not have that here!" Instead, the class is told to embrace
a philosophy of carpe diem, and sic transit J. Evans-Pritchard.
Significantly, however, while Keating subsequently teaches his students
how to stand on their desks, how to kick a soccer ball with gusto and
how to free-associate lamely about Walt Whitman, he's never shown
actually teaching them anything about the basics of form - basics they'd
need in order to appreciate half the writers he's recommending.

...

---

the movie isn't about poetry or writers -- it's a bildungsroman in film,
and though Keating's literature class is a catalyst for the characters'
growth, it didn't seem to serve much except as a mechanism driving the
movie forward -- also created a false dichotomy between the good (those
free-thinkers brave enough to climb out of the box) and the oppressors
of the good (authority figures who hate free-thinkers).

writing, poetry, all that, are more complicated than standing on the
desk and shouting your barbaric Yawp!

or is that my own bias?=20

anybody out there have an opinion on Fry's book? Orr thought it was a
sweet ride, but I don't much care for Orr's opinions.=20

neither; more than the stated content, it's the vitriolic and
hyberbolic tone of the post that indicates that you're not happy.

Hi, Bob.

> I was wondering when you'd join this discussion,

Got tangled-up in a thread I floated on FICINO, about Dictionaries and
Corpora.  Dem NeoLatinists are dead helpful, but I got (and am getting) more
than I bargained for.

> It seems possible to me that something like "the count

[Guesses follow.  I won't go to the stake for anything I say below.]

Um ...  I don't think the "his" form was ever anything other than fairly
exceptional, probably only literary, and mildly pretentious.  Still like it,
but -- "Robin His Book".  Is this "X his book" collocation the commonest
form of the genitival "his"?  I have a feeling it might be.

> Or could the extra syllable in the
> genitive have been lost by the time of printing?

I'd guess that the "e" *had vanished from pronounciation by the time of
Caxton.  Otherwise why any reason to have an apostrophe in the first place?
But this should be fairly easily decided by reference to a history of the
evolution of English pronounciation.  In Baugh's +History of the English
Language+?  But I'm a bit tired to check at the moment.

[Query:  Is there a difference here between Scots and English printers?  We
Scots retained "z" to represent the yogh (still found in the pronounciation
of "Menzies" = [Mingus], for instance), which never made it into an English
standard print font.  Dunno how the possessive apostrophe played north of
the border.  Might look at the Chepman and Millar prints of Dunbar if I
remember.  Should have transcripts on my hard disk somewhere.  Ought to show
up there.]

> Would love to read a book on the apostrophe.

Must be one.  I think maybe in the notes to the article Mark posted.

-- i will certainly pass this info along to friends

-- i think some of the super-wealthy corporate interests who think they have
the right to tell poets what to say and how to develop their art IN POINT OF
FACT have the more responsible and more effective alternative to make a cash
contribution to Poets in Need, so that the community that understands the
work and is entitled to make decisions on its behalf, can take
responsibility for shepherding the resources (i think you know who you are
that i'm talking to out there) --

hi list,

i don't doubt the sincerity and genuine-ness of PIN's efforts. the images=
 of
whalen are a perfect reminder of why such efforts are necessary,
particularly in a "civil" society such as ours that utterly lacks a socia=
l
safety net.

and it's unfortunate that right-minded efforts to address such situations=

can be met with such bitter ressentiment, as if one could actually hold i=
t
against someone like whalen for being the benficiary of even the most mod=
est
relief from real poverty. (the right has notoriously exploited such
sentiments.) moreover, it's clear from the website that this is not welfa=
re
but designed to help individuals through periods of financial crisis.

that said, the statement on the PIN website does beg some questions about=

what constitutes an "established presence," "innovation" and "a substanti=
ve
body of published work." and while i certainly trust the board of directo=
rs
to set fair and reasonable criteria, i wonder if these can be specified
further or if it's a matter of one knowing it when one sees it.

...A final note. I just read somewhere that some of the families of dead
American soldiers are visiting the Iraqi north to see =8Cwhat their sons and
daughters died for=B9. If that=B9s the goal of the visit, then, =B3Ladies and
gentlemen- to your right is the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, to your left is the
Dawry refinery=8A Each of you get this, a gift bag containing a 3 by 3 color
poster of Al Sayid Muqtada Al Sadr (Long May He Live And Prosper), an
Ayatollah Sistani t-shirt and a map of Iran, to scale, redrawn with the
Islamic Republic of South Iraq. Also=8A Hey you! You- the female in the back-
is that a lock of hair I see? Cover it up or stay home.=B2

And that is what they died for.

Does anybody on this listserv know where I can buy a volume of Mu Xin's
poetry? I saw a show of his artwork and prison writings at the University of
Chicago's Smart Museum of Art several years ago, and that's amazing stuff.
The only book I could find about his work is "The Art of Mu Xin: The
Landscape Paintings and Prison Notes." I guess he's written a number of
volumes of poetry but that not too much has been translated into English...

Rumsfeld had a good side to being bad, and we'll get to see
his good side shortly after he's gone.

Now all the stupid military programs Rumsfeld stopped will
come back on line. The $20 billion Crusader Mobile Howitzer
will soon emerge with a fresh name. After sufficient
bribery, it'll have Gates' imprimatur. Nobody will protest
it because nobody knows much about it, same with a lot of
the other old-school military pork Rumsfeld stopped.

The military-industrial complex certainly hated him too, so
consider that you are celebrating his demise in their
company. Bet you they have more expensive party hats.

The difference, Eric, is that this time around scrutiny will be both
intense and orchestrated by committees controlled by Democrats, who
have everything to gain by making Gates' life difficult (after a
pretense at a honeymoon).

If you have followed any of the previous links, you'd see first that some
might have been broken, but also that they represent a fairly innovative
approach to dance and poetics in relation to the analogic and digital.
This is more or less the complete series. I'd be happy for any feedback -
I hope it's of interest here. (This work will be presented live and/or on
DVD all over the place in the future. Some extends from Incidences, a
collaboration between Foofwa and myself, with a group of four additional
dancers, and lighting and computer performers; we just had a ten-day run
in Geneva.)



Cli!


1. Revised urls. The following are all current and from the recent Alps /
Swiss project. Dancers are Foofwa d'Imobilite and Maud Liardon. Sites are
in Gruyere and the Aletsch. The files range in size from 820k on up; I
apologize for the size, but if they were compressed more, they would lose
essential detail.

These files will be online for quite a while. Information might be found
in http://www.asondheim.org/ov.txt and http://www.asondheim.org/ow.txt .

KARI EDWARDS is a poet, artist and gender activist; recipient of a
Small Press Traffic book of the year awards + New Langton Art's Bay
Area Award in literature; author of obedience, iduna, a day in the
life of p., a diary of lies - Belladonna #27, and post/(pink).

poet, filmmaker and conceptual performance artist KATHE IZZO works
with love: childhood, motherhood, sex, and community. Her elegant
installations, both confrontational and emotionally intimate,
incorporate her physical presence into a performance space at once
natural, theatrical & sacred; slipping through the subtle crack
between limitation & liberation, between art & life. Her work has been
shown most recently in solo shows at  Artemis (Miami), Cinders
(Williamsburg),  Experimentica (Cardiff), Highways (LA) and Movement
Research (NYC) and Wild Gift (London). In her most ambitious work so
far, The True Love Project, Izzo has loved the world, one person at a
time (for one day, one hour, one afternoon, evening or morning) for
the last four years. The True Love Project and all it's subsidiaries
are based on the principle of direct energetic transmission from
artist to audience through the medium of love as art. By spending time
together, all parties, artist and audience, are immediately and
irrevocably transformed. To this date, she has loved over 400 private
audiences, with only a few disgruntled patrons. Izzo's poetry, memoirs
and short fiction have been published in numerous journals and
anthologies. An early formative performance has been preserved for
posterity in the seminal Jack Smith collection of writings: MEET ME AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL/Serpent's Tail. She is currently at work on her
memoir, LOVE ARTIST.

KEITH KNIGHT is an award-winning San Francisco based cartoonist and
rapper.  His two weekly comic strips, the K Chronicles and (th)ink
(seen locally in the  S.F. Chronicle's 96 Hours), can be found in over
thirty-five alternative, ethnic, political  and college newspapers
across the country. His latest book, The Beginner's Guide to
Community-Based Arts, is a primer for anyone looking to use art for
social change. Knight is also the narrator for the KQED artist
documentary. show Spark. Not bad for a former Michael Jackson
impersonator. For more info, see www.kchronicles.com

ANNALEE NEWITZ is the founder of the webzine Bad Subjects; author of
the books White Trash: Race and Class in America, The Bad Subjects
Anthology, the recently published Pretend We're Dead (based on
doctoral research on capitalism and monster movies), and the
forthcoming anthology She's Such a Geek, about female nerds. Her
weekly syndicated column, Techspolitation, explores the way media
mutates and reiterates everyday life. She is a contributing editor at
Wired magazine, and a recipient of a Knight Science Journalism
Fellowship. Newitz's writings have appeared in magazines and papers
such as Wired, New York Magazine, Popular Science, New Scientist,
Salon, SecurityFocus, The Industry Standard, GettingIt, Feed, Gear,

Hi All,

We have an open date in our levy lives: celebrating the renegade press
series on Thurs. Jan. 4, 2007. If your press is game to take this slot--rea=
d
our invite letter below for more information--please email me asap.

thanks,
David

-------

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I'm the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New
York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 16th year.
I'd like to invite you to take part in year four of our "d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press" series.

The series is held at Chelsea's ACA Galleries (http://acagalleries.com/),
which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik.
It's a nice space, and we fit 100 people, including a 9-piece jazz flash
orchestra, in it for Chax Press's event, with plenty of room to spare. The
gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers and
hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three or mor=
e
of their authors to read (we've had as many as 10 for one press and usually
have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform two 15-2=
0
minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book a musical act that's
preferred, so it's truly their night, if not I can book one that I think
will work well with the night.

We started the series in August 2003. In our first four seasons we've
hosted/are scheduled to host:

(locations are at the time of the event)

Subject: Memorial for Brad Will, Saturday 1-5 at St. Mark's Church
in-the-Bowery

Hi everybody.

I wanted to make sure everyone knew that Brad's memorial will be this
Saturday at 1:00 at St. Mark's Church, 2nd Ave and 10th St in
Manhattan.

There will also be other events for most of the weekend, there is more
information about everything at www.friendsofbradwill.com.

Hopefully we can all come together and help each other get through
this. A note about the memorial follows this mail. Also, I'm sorry if
you got this email and don't know who I'm talking about -- I am
sending this to a lot of people because Brad knew a lot of people, and
I want to make sure everybody who wants to remember him has the
opportunity to attend the memorial. Please spread the word to anyone
you know who you think might have known brad. This is a very DIY
affair, and I want to make sure the word gets out. Thank you.

Love,
Jenny

********************

As people began to plan, plot and scheme for the memorial of that
most-notorious schemer and co-conspirator, Brad Will, the very first
thought in the room was to have *all* of us participate in the
creation of this moment.  To that end, space will be created for all
of you to contribute in whatever way you choose to do so.  There will
be a DIY collage wall; there will be a place to record your memories;
there will be songs sung together; there will be bread broken
together.  So, whatever you got- poems, words, photos, paintings,
drawings, banners, flyers, flowers, puppets, drums, instruments, food,
tea, coffee, liquor, whatever...

BRING IT!

PS- We encourage you try to bring your own reusable utensils, plates, and
mugs for food and drink in order to use less paper and plastic products.

Please also help outreach to folks who would like to come, especially
those who do not access to the internet.

According to this: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n21/harr04_.html, he
oversaw a military spend of up to *$8billion dollars per month* at
it's current levels. I think a gold-plated howitzer with egg-timer is
far the better option.

Vetoing spend-plans is one thing; ignoring operational advice is by
far another. His previous experience as Secretary of Defence did not
stand him in good stead for war.

Gates is mired^H^H^Htrained in the Iran-contra affair so expect a call
to his old buddy Ollie North, whose warnings did not prevent the
return of Ortega in Nicaragua.

I would say that there's not a chance on earth that he'll even take
North's calls. There are always goons available who aren't publicly tainted.

Big losers in the election are Limbaugh et freres. Not likely to be
as central to the planning of the Grand Old Party as they have been.
And they were North's constituency.

The 2008 campaign has just begun.

Yeah, add Gates to the list of operatives in this administration whose previous job experience includes "unindicted co-conspirator." This move, coupled with the fact that John Negroponte still walks the earth as a free man (as does North, of course, along with boatloads of other Iran-Contra criminals) points to dismal days ahead in which the war could be transformed from "our" dirty job to an even dirtier, but plausibly-deniable proxy struggle dominated by black ops and staffed with the ubiquitous "military advisors" and "training specialists." These sorts of noises are already being made: it's a version of Murtha's "over-the-horizon" redeployment plan that could be sold to Republicans, which will give it a certain amount of "bipartisan" currency. My fear is that the Democrats will be persuaded to go right along, as it's an option that will, if nothing else, lead to reduced loss of U.S. lives in the short term.

  So, from a doomed strategy of "Vietnamization" to a doomed strategy of "Central Americanization" ("death squads operating out of the Interior Ministry" does have an awfully familiar ring, doesn't it?).

Wasn't Gates part of the Iraq Study Group?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Study_Group_Report

"The report is expected to present two alternative policies. Redeploy
and Contain calls for the phased withdrawal of US troops to bases near
Iraq where they could be redeployed against new threats, such as an
emerging terrorist organization, anywhere in the region.[3] Stability
First calls for maintaining a presence in Baghdad and encouraging
insurgents to enter the political arena, while Iraq's neighbors,
including Iran and Syria, would be asked to help end the fighting."

This move, coupled with the fact that John Negroponte still walks the earth as a free man (as does North, of course, along with boatloads of other Iran-Contra criminals) points to dismal days ahead in which the war could be transformed from "our" dirty job to an even dirtier, but plausibly-deniable proxy struggle dominated by black ops and staffed with the ubiquitous "military advisors" and "training specialists." These sorts of noises are already being made: it's a version of Murtha's "over-the-horizon" redeployment plan that could be sold to Republicans, which will give it a certain amount of "bipartisan" currency. My fear is that the Democrats will be persuaded to go right along, as it's an option that will, if nothing else, lead to reduced loss of U.S. lives in the short term.

 >>I think a gold-plated howitzer with egg-timer is

We'll see, Roger. I expect current spending levels with the
gold-plated howitzer thrown in as a promotional incentive.
Plus after we allow Iran to go nuclear, at least six other
Arab nations will do the same--at least that's what they've
announced. Then there's China's quiet and intractable
military build-up.

So that's: current spending levels, gold-plated howitzers,
nuclear proliferation leading to a new and more dangerous
type of Cold War, and China's young unmarried male
population going into its army. Wait, did I mention space
defense? Information warfare? Nanotech war? Venezuela?

So that's current spending levels, gold-plated howitzers ...
and maybe some poetry.

  DALE SMITH: TALK & READING
    Tuesday, November 14
      2:00 p.m. talk: On Poetry’s Audience
4:00 p.m. poetry reading
            the Poetry Collection
420 Capen Hall
SUNY at Buffalo
(North Campus)
  Austin based poet and small press publisher Dale Smith edits Skanky Possum Books with Hoa Nguyen. Selections from his first book, American Rambler (Thorp Springs 2000), were selected by Robert Creeley to appear in Best American Poetry 2002. Black Stone was published this fall by Effing Press. Other books include The Flood and the Garden (First Intensity 2002) and Notes No Answer (Habenicht Press 2005). His work has also appeared in the Chicago Review, Jacket, Fascicle, First Intensity, Damn the Caesars, and elsewhere.
this event is FREE & open to the public

Dale Smith on poetry’s audience (from a July  19, 2006 blog entry):
    “My thesis is that poetry’s audience is not present, but always forming. Its flux results from the unique negation of the subject by words in the act of poetic making. That is, words are not our own: they extend from a play of forces at work in the transmission of appearances at particular instances in the practice of this art.”

This is quite interesting to see a genuine gold-plated neocon on the
list -- certainly one for the bestiary.

I get that your thoughts run along the lines of "Rumsfeld, thou
shouldst be with us at this hour."  But help me out, Mr. Yost, as I'm
kinda naive.  "After we allow Iran to go nuclear."  Golly gee, And all
the while I thought that the initial acquisition of nuclear technology
by Iran was during the Shah's regime.  D'ya remember that, Mr. Yost?
You know, the Shah, America's boy, the one "we" installed after
overthrowing the nasty democratically-elected Mossadegh back in the
Pleistocene Era, I mean the 1950s.  But what's the solution that would
prevent that "going nuclear," Eric?  Do tell, from your neoconned
perspective.  Maybe nuking "them" before "they" nuke "us," or whoever?

Am I forgetting something?  Like Israel?  Oh dear, Mr. Yost, maybe
it's not too late for you to get in touch with Mordecai Vanunu and get
an explanation from him.  Remember him?  Naaah, I guess you don't.

"China's quiet and intractable military build-up."  Yep, those sneaky,
shifty-eyed Asians, always working on the sly, complete with unmarried
males (maybe you could call up your contacts in the Unification Church
and organize some mass wedding ceremony in some stadium or other).  By
the way, Eric, do your Pentagon sources talk about space missile
defense systems to you?  Or is that strictly neo-confidential?

Venezuela?  Don't they have a legally elected government there?  Oh,
but wait, they "don't like us."  Once again, Eric, have any of your
sources told you something we don't know yet.  Something on the order
of "Kick Chavez's Ass, Get the Gas"?  Oops, forgot something else.
Trade with Venezuela has increased over the past year.  Exxon Mobil's
making out pretty well with those new contracts.  And most of
Venezuelan crude is refined in the US.  Better go set up picket lines
outside of CITGO stations, Eric, the republic is in danger.

Or is all this just an elaborate hoax and you're "performing" neocon
ideology to get a proverbial rise out of us?  In either case, Mister
Yost, later, way, way later for you.  Sorry you lost Rumsfeld, though,
who was/is a "found poet" of sorts.

i celebrate with you on this one, having spent most of my time since june
working on local, state and federal campaigns.  and after the crushing
defeat in 2004, (having worked then as well), i can only say that this feels
for me the same way it felt when i was 9, watching the berlin wall come down
and seeing the USSR shatter.   we are, finally, after 6 years, taking our
country back.  and i don't mean just dems, i mean all of us.  this
railroading  and ramrod-ing of extreme  ideals and corportare-funded
legislation is finally going to stop, and be undone.

although, i must say: the cancelled poetry reading was the absolute least of
this administrations crimes...

raising my glass,

I'm going to have to rethink this Bush guy. Anyone
who cancels a poetry reading can't be *all* bad.

Ah, the US innocence continues. Good to see.

Christopher misidentifies me as a neo-con and writes, "help
me out, Mr. Yost, as I'm kinda naive."

Yeah I've noticed.

Christopher: Am I forgetting something?

Yeah, like the point of the post, the thread. You
essentially wrote to bash me because I said there's nothing
much to celebrate about Rumsfeld's departure, that
essentially we'll get the Rumsfeld spending levels PLUS the
military pork that's been backburnered until Rumsfeld goes.
I don't mind you being so naive as to imagine a change, and
feel that something really good was accomplished, but your
personal attacks are way over the line. Just because you're
too lazy to put any reading behind your politics, you adopt
a defensive strategy of high moral ground. It's bad faith,
dude. And it's vicious.


 >"After we allow Iran to go nuclear."  Golly gee, And all
the while I thought that the initial acquisition of nuclear
technology by Iran was during the Shah's regime.  D'ya
remember that, Mr. Yost?


"We" (as in "we allow Iran to go nuclear") refers to the US
and the European Three who have tried hard to prevent
Iranian weapons development. Christopher thinks that if he
can shout about all the terrible things the US did in the
Cold War, it will somehow alter the question of whether Iran
should be allowed to have nuclear weapons. It won't. Iran
probably will get a nuclear weapon. Then lots of other
countries will get them and we'll enter a new and more
dangerous version of the Cold War.

More from Christopher:  You know, the Shah, America's boy,
the one "we" installed after overthrowing the nasty
democratically-elected Mossadegh back in the Pleistocene
Era, I mean the 1950s.

Pathetic. You need a little more Cold War history than the
little tidbits you use to support your "enlightened"
alienation.

First of all, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was the shah of Iran
from 1941 to 1979, except for a brief time in 1953 when
Prime Minister Muhammed Mosaddeq overthrew him. The Soviets
were strongly entrenched in Iran in WW2, and after the war
and a forced Soviet retraction from Iran, Mossadegh seized
power. Not willing to risk Soviet control of Iran over
certainty about Mossadegh's alliances, especially after he
nationalized the oil industry, the US ousted him by a
counter-coup. Now put this in the context of the Cold War,
and the US behavior is not particularly egregious for either
side. Not quite a Prague '68, was it?

"American innocence" is right on.  I understand the euphoria -- the
Bushwhackers deserved to get a good smackdown and to eat some of the
excrement they've liberally dished out to all of us over the years --
but believe me, the Dems will do everything in their power to ensure
that it's short-lived.  Their policy on Iraq is "do the job right,"
their policy on Iran is "get tough," and their policy on Israel
is "kill as many Palestinians as possible and claim it was in self-
defense."

Schadenfreude is no substitute for the radical critique of existing
conditions.  And the Democrats -- as the left head of our bicephalous
one party state -- are unworthy of those who voted them in.  Look at
Schwarzenegger: he's saying that it was a good thing the Democrats got
elected because they're in a position to "shake things up" (i.e., hire
different lobbyists and media consultants) in Washington.  They're not
just in the corporate state's pocket: to a large extent, they ARE the
corporate state.  Unless of course you think that the George Soroses
and Bill Gateses are somehow progressive -- to which I say,
paraphrasing George Bowering though in a different language, "Sancta
simplicitas!"

Dear friends of Nightboat Books,


At long last, we are proud--thrilled really!--to
announce the publication of Radical Love: 5 Novels by
Fanny Howe. This volume includes the texts of Nod, The
Deep North, Famous Questions, Saving History and
Indivisible. It's a beautiful book and selling for
less than 20 dollars! We hope you will go right to

http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=9780976718536

or to your local independent bookstore and order your
copy!

Of this book Robert Creeley wrote, "I have not the
least doubt that her work is parallel to Paul
Auster's...or any other writer thus whose books are
not simply products for the market--albeit the work
can reach a very large number of potential readers
indeed. In Fanny's case these will range from
contemporary fellow writers questioning ways and means
in their art and all who find their enterprise of
interest, to those who feel themselves confronted with
deeply ingrained questions of religion, person,
society, gender, politics, which almost anyone alive
at this moment is trying to answer."

Spread the word!


Kazim Ali
Nightboat Books

Well -- chalk it up to my -- "US"? thank you George Bowering, and
that level of cynicism surely crosses borders, no? (or to say it more
bluntly, Canada is surely not immune to your insinuations) --
ignorance or innocence, but we really could do with a little
breathing in & out before we launch head first into our polisci
critiques, now that we've got, those of us who were looking for some
sign of change, as much putative electoral change as one might
reasonably have expected.  I appreciate the pessimistic analyses,
that is, and I'm with those of you who suggest that the hard work
begins now.

But at the same time, I'm with Susan M at this moment.  If we can't
muster some collective optimism of the will, we'll likely walk around
with pinched little faces that nobody will care to look at, let alone
listen to.  Of course I've had this problem on this list before -- to
be candid, I have this problem with undergrad politics & govt majors
who think, now that they've seen the curtains pulled back a bit, that
there's no point in even casting a vote -- and this may be a matter
of, what, emphasis.  Or perhaps I'm more easily piqued than some
around here.

But political change isn't simply about verifying one's institutional
suspicions.  (Literary interpretation isn't simply about this either,
but that's a whole nother story.)  Pointing out just how dire the
situation continues to be, as necessary as it might be to do so,
might not bring anyone to the polls.  (Yes, I'm suggesting a problem
with the relationship between politics and political theory.)  If you
want change, you have at least, I think, to acknowledge, publicly,
the incremental changes that could catalyze, however they do so,
long-term social change.  Pooh-poohing same, from where I'm sitting,
can just as easily feed the opposition.

So I'll observe that we're in the midst of an historic moment, if
politics in this country can in any sense *be* historic; that a good
portion (albeit a sad percentage) of the U.S. public has registered a
resounding "No Thank You" to Bush & Co., however much they may be
duped by, or may ascribe to, their govt's machinations; and that this
at least deserves a toast as we push ahead into the more difficult
times that doubtless await us.  This is the first time in a long
while that I see signs of hope.

Cheers!

Best,

Joe

I want to second Joe's message below. I'm personally sick of cynicism,
given over to it far too often myself. There are times it's necessary to
rejoice; I was astonished in fact that the vote turned out the way it did,
and it does say something for our electorate and democracy 'in action'
here. (Iraq god knows is another and horrific story.) And emotionally,
things changed so quickly; what I felt was the residue of the cold war is
finally, perhaps only temporarily, disappearing, and there's the
possibility of something else.

There are times I hate the left albeit me.

During the election when Bush jr. was elected president for the first time,
there was widespread cynicism that there was very little difference between
him and Gore. But, in retrospect, we see that the differences between what
has gone down and what might have been with Gore and the Democrats is vast.

Congratulations to the USAmericans on the mid-term elections. It is very
good news indeed.

Now let's hope that there is some meaningful action on climate change on the
federal level very soon.

Have to chime in to agree (guardedly) with Joe here. My sour note about Gates at DoD notwithstanding, I think a bit of cautious optimism is in order following this election, both for the immediate outcome and in a larger sense for how it (mis)represents (as all such "respresentative" political moments fundamentally distort) an underlying shift among -- what? -- "the people?" OK so I'm still too cynical to muster that one without scare quotes, and no one's sold me on a more accurate term sans irony. But it'll have to do as a placeholder.

I sympathize and agree with the critique of capital's stacking and skewing of political and class power, and how that minimizes the differences between electoral options. I really do. But I think we need to remind ourselves occasionally that even minimal differences have real effects in terms of setting horizons of possiblity for future political action. Joe's mention of breathing here is apropos -- at minimum, what the election has bought is some breathing room. First, in that it's possible to imagine a bit of downshifting (I don't think any brakes are being applied yet, but you take what you can get) in our downhill slide toward fully-elaborated police statism. And second, in that the modes of organization and mobilization that exceed the electoral -- the real that representative politics distorts -- get a good bit easier and more productive when they can proceed from a collective victory, however small and compromised.

The systemic critique, for me, has its strongest application as the reminder in the midst of all this that, because of the minimization of radical difference within electoral politics, any such victory, while having its actual effects, is a tactical rather than a strategic one. So, on the one hand (back in that runaway truck again), it would be politically suicidal to throw it into neutral, light up a smoke and give the whole disaster a self-satisfied "fuck it." And on the other hand, it'd be no less suicidal to figure everything's alright now because we'll hit that hairpin turn at the bottom of the grade doing 90 instead of 120. (Metric conversion available upon request for the rest of the world).

Well, Mrs Clinton spent 30 million dollars to get re-elected. In a lot
of places,
and in the view of a lot of people in places other than the USA, that
would not
resemble what a lot of people have in mind as democracy.

What is "cautious optimism"?

Optimism means hoping for the most favorable outcome possible.

That isn't done cautiously.

Hey Taylor thanks for this---

I am curious if you'd be interested in elaborating how you
understand, conceive, or 'define' the difference
between "Strategic" and "tactical"---I get a sense from context, but
I get the sense that you've spent a lot of time
working out a more fleshed out sense of how that distinction works
for you that might be worth sharing here....

(I'm also curious about the difference between "cautious optimism"
and "optimistic caution"---
but I can save that for another time...

Chris

Well, the republicans spent a lot more and Clinton frankly didn't have to;
she's incredibly popular here. This doesn't quite make your case, sorry.

All,
If I may interject: there is one immediate and
palpable positive consequence of the dem victory.
Though it may not last, it's worth celebrating as far
as I'm concerned: that is, the entirely world
registers gop's defeat as a point in favor of the
"American people". For the first time in years, the
world is happy with the US, at least on this score. It
seems to me likely to improve the diplomatic
atmosphere for a few weeks at least.
Amicalement

Chris,

  In the military application that it usually refers back to, the distinction is similar (though it doesn't map precisely) to one between ends and means. Strategic outcomes are usually the those that affect an enemy's capacity to make war, make politics, make statecraft in some fairly large-scale and long-term way. Tactical outcomes are usually cast in terms of maneuver -- e.g., I outflank you here, which is a tactic used toward the strategic end of, say, cutting off one part of your forces from another and taking over your productive agricultural regions in between, thus diminishing your capacity as an economic actor over the long term, as well as your territorial sovereignty.

  Incidentally, this distinction marks a moment where I think even certain people on the right who had a baseline of comfort with the idea of the U.S. pursuing political goals through the projection of military force began to realize that Bush had gone badly off the rails. Remember how he answered that question, "What's the strategy in Iraq?" -- "Well, we keep taking the fight to the terr'ists" or something like that. Which ain't by any measure a strategy: it's a tactic, and not a particularly good one at that. (This is glossing over, of course, the millions of us in that derided "focus group" who had been pointing out from the beginning that -- even leaving aside considerations of justice and moral conduct -- there simply were no good strategic outcomes to be imagined for this war).

  The military connotations _are_ a bit unfortunate, aren't they? To open things up a bit, there's also all that stuff in de Certeau about tactics being the form of resistance of the weak. I.e., in a more broadly social sense, those groups that have been shut out of access to the determination of broader social outcomes (strategy) continue a struggle of maneuver and time-biding through tactical action. (Classic examples in labor would be la perruque, work-to-rule, etc.)

  One thing that occurs to me is that the line between strategy and tactics tends to shift depending on the scope of one's frame of reference. Thus, if I'm tied at some deep level to the Democratic party (e.g., I'm a state campaign chair or full-time operative) and I've been working for the past 6 years to see something like this election happen, this might well look like a strategic victory. However, for what I think is the underlying question some of us are trying to ask here -- what, if anything at all, is the relationship between this election and the prospects for something like substantive social justice, an end to imperial uses of power, or even just an end to this goddamned war -- what was accomplished on Tuesday was accomplished at the level of tactics. It opened up a certain room for maneuver that had been a good bit narrower on Monday. The question now is what further work can be done within that space.

  Taylor

  P.S. to George Bowering: Yes, I have a dictionary too, though mine doesn't seem to hold sway over language as a kind of fate. So you're correct, the strict definition which links "optimism" to the "optimal" isn't what I'm looking for here, but I'm hearing as well a fairly widespread vernacular use that simply takes it as "hope for something better." But if you want to ask a bald man to split hairs, fine, let's call it a "limited meliorative perspective."

Well, Mr. Yost, as you recover from your high dudgeon, ringing
disclaimers, and virtuous outrage, allow me to venture a few
correctives to your narrative of history and your pretenses at hard-
headed sophistication.

By presenting Rumsfeld as some kind of anti-corruption and anti-waste
crusader, you basically echo his self-presentation (and ignore the
mind-boggling and horrendous corruption and waste prevalent in the
Iraq that he helped create through his shock-and-awe).  And by
endorsing intervention against Mossadegh (fomented by the CIA), who,
horror of
horrors! "nationalized the oil industry" (and who *was* democratically
elected, which you also brush over -- not enough reading on *your*
part, clearly), you accept the essential premise of today's neo-con
policies, and conveniently overlook details like the secret police
force known as SAVAK (read poet Reza Baraheni's
THE CROWNED CANNIBALS for an account of one of the victims of their
practices), which practiced torture and repression on a huge scale
following the delinquent Shah Pahlevi's re-installation atop his bogus
Peacock Throne.

Iran, by the way, was a dry run for the CIA-backed coup in Guatemala
("our" sphere of influence) one year later, also against the alleged
Communist threat posed by a democratically elected government that was
getting a little too close to entrenched interests (United Fruit, in
this case).  The Guatemalan people are
still recovering from the legacy of that intervention.  (Odd, isn't
it, how following US meddling, the death toll goes up and the death
squads get to work?)

Mentioning Prague 68 (15 years later) is a red herring, and manifests
a logic usually indulged in by, yes, neo-cons (and Stalinists for that
matter), namely, a "gotcha back" approach to argument.  Hungary 56, in
any case, would have been a more persuasive example (and the US
definitely didn't want a government of workers' councils to upset
stability and spheres of influence in that part of the world, so
government officials beat their breasts and shed crocodile tears and,
contrary to Iran three years earlier,
did...nothing.  No oil in Hungary, after all).

Never mind Iran, I don't think the *US* should be allowed to have
nuclear weapons.  After all, they've used them.  Twice.  How is it,
Mr. Yost, that you overlook that detail?  And you coyly dodged the
whole Israel nuclear issue, though they sold nuclear technology to our
old ally, apartheid South Africa (talk about proliferation!!).  And
Venezuela.  Ah, disingenuousness.

... every thoughtful person's dream, a long political thread!

Christopher: Never mind Iran, I don't think the *US* should
be allowed to have nuclear weapons.  After all, they've used
them.  Twice.  How is it, Mr. Yost, that you overlook that
detail?


Eric: In the very long run I agree with you. The US should
not have nuclear weapons. We probably disagree on how to get
to that point, (You might like the Nuclear Threat
Initiative's Global Security E-mail Alerts sign up at
http://www.nti.org.)


Christopher: [Mossadegh] who *was* democratically elected,
which you also brush over -- not enough reading on *your*
part, clearly),

Eric: Mossadegh was also constitutionally and formally
dismissed by the Shah. This after Mossadegh tried to force
the Shah to leave Iran. This after Mossadegh had rigged a
national referendum (99.9% yes vote) to dissolve the Iranian
parliament. Hello.

Christopher: [I was] presenting Rumsfeld as some kind of
anti-corruption and anti-waste crusader ...

Eric: Rumsfeld made a lot of bureaucratic enemies through
his attempts to restructure the armed forces. The old hogs
at the trough were being replaced by new hogs at the trough.
Field howitzers, for example, were being ignored for
procurement over UAVs like the famous Predator and the less
well-known Northrop Grumman M-350 UAV. The old hogs at the
trough hated Rumsfeld. He was changing force structure to
modular brigade units and taking power and lucrative
contracts away from lots of well-connected Pentagon
military-industrial complex "revolving door"
technocrat-elite people. You would be amused if you
researched the story of the Crusader Mobile Howitzer, read
how Rumsfeld killed it, how the power elite kept trying to
get the Crusader into production, introducing it several
times as fine-print to bills offered by both GOPs and DEMs,
having it killed there, reintroduced for another service,
killed again, and probably ultimately the project put into a
"hold until after Rumsfeld" file.

That's why I wrote that Gates would give us R's spending
level PLUS the old pork that was waiting for R's ouster.

Don't know how to put it more clearly. If you have bothered
to read this far, and you still think I'm making a neo-con
point, no amount of discourse will change your opinion.

Thank you Alex

yes for now there is a mood of hope from letters and news from abroad--a
very cautious hope, but a hope--

many of my friends in other countries have wondered how bad things wd get
before Americans finally--if ever--voiced opposition and did something about
the Evil Ones--began to at any rate--and ask--where are the poets, artists,
singers, writers in all of this?--does their relative silence indicate a
complicity?---what has happened?--

"abandon hope all who enter here"--i keep thinkiing of the day when the new
Senators and Congresspersons will be shown to their new abodes --
"and here Ladies and Gentleman, is the Lobby"--

in a few years or less will one be invoking the ghosts of Ivan Albright,
Francis Bacon and Francesco Goya again to do official portraits?-- the
"after" portraits of "before and after entering the Lobby . . . "

there is an old French saying:

on your way to a new town, look carefully at the faces of the people who are
coming towards you as they leave it

i hope the newly elected ones take a lot of long hard looks and remember
those faces
leaving--
so one fine morning they don't start seeing those same faces in their
mirrors--

(Rolling Stone had astounding piece on the Congress--persons and events and
words of an apocalyptic hideousness worthy of anything in Revelations--)

one thought:

rumsfeld restructured the military (and spending) because he envisioned, and
he said it many times, a lighter, leaner military force.  one capable, as
our military did, of entering a country and toppling it within days.  the
quagmire in iraq (the huge security vacuum caused by that policy, among
others) is a certain effect of rumsfeld's vision.  what truthfully scares me
is that a lean, light military force would need to be in place for our
country to, say, jump into countries across the world to 'bring them
democracy".

that mr. rumsfeld cut spending was less a reflection of his personal
"goodness" and more an outgrowth of what republicans USED to hold dear:
fiscal conservativism, small (non-invasive) government, etc.  of course, the
administration got futher and further away from those ideals, and so did
rummy.

here's what gives me hope: the regime of hijackers at the top is crumbling,
and there will no longer be the opportunity/license for these folks to do
whatever they want.  they are now accountable.  thank god!

cheers on a gloomy friday in michigan,

ah, this is not innocence.  the euphoria wore off yesterday.  what it is, is
realizing that the mother of all hurdles has been cleared.  with much much
much more hard work, we can get back to work showing our government what we
really mean when we say democracy.

i suppose i'm just "not jaded enough" yet.  but then again, maybe that's how
we got to this point, eh?

Larissa: Not sure making way for Cheney's Haliburton hogs
makes for a good  example of Rumsfield's anti-pork leanings.


Never said Rumsfeld was anti-pork; said his mandate to
effect military "transformation" made the old hogs his
enemies. The new hogs like him fine. Haliburton is always a
new hog. Robert Gates, on the other hand, as ex-spook, is
likely to bring back some old military pork.

It's factional. On the AP wire a few weeks ago there was an
anonymous comment by a "senior Pentagon official" (maybe
Gen. Pace, who knows?) that by concentrating on
counterinsurgency in Iraq, the US Army might be losing its
ability to conduct conventional warfare. Maybe you recall
the comment? The subtext of that media musing is "let's
spend money on conventional war technologies and training."

Could that concern be addressed in part by procuring ... the
Crusader Mobile Howitzer? Hmmm. Probably have to rename it.

The relentless, unstoppable marketing of that weapons system
could itself be the subject of an epic comic poem, a poem
that interprets current history through the howitzer's
procurement phases. Rumsfeld's ouster could introduce its
paradiso section, its own Scripts for the Pageant, where
Rama returns and rules wisely.

Stumbling, descend Urania ...

I like Taylor Brady's analysis - to the degree that a modern State functions
like plumbing (the present unilateral pipes have given us x and they
jammed,full of Sh... Etc.) and the current dynamic can beneficially change
with better plumbers and a structural change in the way the pipes permit the
flow of democratic processes, wise intentions, and a genuine public interest
in the whole.  Of course, that ain't going to be easy, but the lid has been
ripped off the junta (R-C & B), the Republican control of Congress has been
decimated for the foreseeable future, and the election has provided the
congress with permission to move in a different direction - no matter how
bumpy its bound to be.

But, to be truthful, I think many of us are still in a state of collective
shock. It feels as if a heavy, thick swath of velcro has ripped off the
personal and public the psyche; the gates are open and the six years of
imprisonment is over, and we are streaming, finally, out of the gates.

I don't wish big ill on anybody, but it is quite wondrous to see Rumsfeld's
shoulders fallen, walking out of the Oval office a broken, and, certainly,
not in line for any historian's victory script.

I know there is a lot of work to be done. But I think many deep breaths,
followed by private and public celebrations are in order. I have already
been two this week!

Thanks, Alison.  I put a link to your discussion in my
entry for tomorrow--even though I disagree with your
contention that government funding of the arts is a
no-brainer.  I favor it only because our government
funds everything else, so it ought to fund something
I'm for, too.  Not that it actually ever will, except
by mistake.  But you made some excellent points, as
did several of those commenting on your entry.

all best, Bob

ps, apologies if this is my second reply to your post;
my computer kicked me out of my first reply before I'd
finished it.  Dunno whether it posted it or not.

Taylor, thanks for these ruminations.....the idea of the "tactical
outcome" still seems conceptually a little oxymoronic to me, yet many
of us, at different times, do choose short term gains (or, as you
say--De Certeau---shut out of access to the determination of broader
social outcomes....), and that's certainly encouraged in the current
political (and social) climates of American--mass-media culture....
         Hell, one could say this very medium of email, the web, etc.
(to say nothing of the idea of "poetry scenes" as they often manifest
themselves) is one of the many tactics that could get mistaken for
strategies. That's near the core of the issue---that "tactical
outcomes" are often touted as strategic outcomes---whether it was the
swift month-after VICTORY in Iraq a few years back, or whether the
premature celebration of elections, even before the elected officials
DO anything ("Happy Days Are Here Again," "Don't Stop Thinkin' Bout
2Morrow," the other idea Air America playing "Send Out The Clowns,"
even before the results were in)....A nearsighted vision of self-
interest; fame-as-an-end-itself, quarterly profits, protecting
privilege from responsibility and honesty, "immediate gratification"
that often is neither immediate nor gratifying much less strategic....
(the poetry scene as microcosm or unconscious introjection of the
very things it often claims to be opposed to)

So, yeah, I largely agree. I like to think the euphoria is gone, or
if it persists at least does not get in the way of the realization
that these dems have a huge responsibility now....
coz 1) the republicans, and many disaffected republican voters who
cast the vote at least as much to 'send a message to Bush' as for
anything else, are going to be extremely skeptical of these new
representatives and senators, like a "OKAY, SO YOU"VE BEEN
COMPLAININ' ABOUT BUSH! WELL, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT ANY
BETTER..." (like a threat!)

and 2) However unfairly, these dems are likely to have a VERY SHORT
LEASH. Because if these Democrats can't deal with the MESS BUSH MADE
in a somewhat quick easy way (remember the phrase MOPPING UP; there's
a reason why Bush used that in "fast food nation"), they're probably
going to be held more accountable. It doesn't matter if these DEMS
either would have never gone into Iraq or the first place, or waged
the war smarter, what matters to many voters (fairly or unfairly) is
whether the dems (working with the republicans) can almost do the
impossible----"peace with honor" that pleases the "hawks," "doves"
oh, and of course the "chicken hawks," "masters of war," etc.....
And if they can't, it's likely that the 2008 congress might end up
even more "red" republican than 2004 was
("we gave 'em a chance, and they were just as bad"). The "burden of
proof" is on the democrats to be more upstanding than the
republicans---they will be held to higher standards---that's my hunch
from watching this kind of thing first hand for a a few decades....
     so maybe there's too much work to do to be "optimistic" (or
"pessimistic" for that matter...)

Robert,
See also David's (and Mark's? Sorry, didn't get it)
reply. But I'll respond to your hostility. You seem to
think I'm trying to make excuses for something, but
I'm just jumping on the limited meliorative
perspective bandwagon with my 2cents. Who is "you"
that is "losing that war", and who is the "you" that
you (who's that?) "don't like"? You're American, and
don't like the French? Or you're not American, and
don't like Americans? I don't get it. One way or the
other, I think you're putting me in the wrong
container. I never voted for Bush, never supported the
war, denounced his flag-waving demagogy from the
beginning (in France, in a local televised interview
in Rennes -- but they cut out my comments with any
substance). Yup, America is losing the war, should
never have gotten into it, the loss of life is an
unredeemable tragedy...what is it you want me to say
here? I wasn't implying we suddenly became angels in
the world's eyes, don't be ridiculous. But the news
seems to suggest that the dem victory hasn't done us
harm in that respect, to say the least. And I think a
tiny bit less hatred is likely to improve things for
everyone.
What is your problem, that you're so ready to
implicitly call me one of the murderers?
This list sucks. If I read one more of these hostile,
mean-spirited posts directed at *anyone*, I'm outta
here.
Alex

I also believe the war isn't remotely worth fighting for US

I really don't know anything. I just hope I'm wrong. You

streaming out the prison gates rather than heading for a

Iraq has nothing to do with any of this.

But you do raise an interesting moral question: how much of "their"
insecurity, suffering, and death is "our" etc. worth? What level of
danger, since danger is always there, justifies one killing, let
alone mass slaughter? If you set the threshold low enough, genocide
becomes perfectly ethical.

If you accept Cheney's policy - hit first before they hit you (and
damn anyone that tries to stop you) - then welcome to the
slaughter-house and the war-lords rule. The gutting of international
treaties and organisations has been one of the least favourable
aspects of the Bush regime.

I may be wrong as most of my US news comes from Doonesbury but I think
your - and mine as I can the current bunch of hypocrites that run my
country are equally enamoured of religion - are internal as much as
external.

Hi there. A friend forwarded this article/remembrance, which a friend of his wrote about Brad Will for the "Brooklyn Rail." I think it's very lovely:

http://brooklynrail.org/2006-11/express/remembering-brad

In other news, I agree with Chris S. that this crop of democrats will be held to perhaps impossibly high standards--"If they can't make everything better, forget it." The only thing I can think of that would "make this war better" would have been to listen to the people, in and out of government, who were offering evidence for why it should not have begun. God knows there is nothing "optimal" about where we are now; but I am trying to hold onto optimism nonetheless, and hoping everyone will realize that a world where the numbers of people murdered internationally--shot dead, bombed, starved, whatever it is--are smaller, is an improvement, if not any kind of perfect fix. (Ah, but S.H. was killing Iraqi civillians, yes? But so have we been. Have we killed fewer of them? Does anyone really know? I'd like to see those numbers. Or, scratch that; I don't know if I want to see them.) Count me, too, as cautiously optimistic, Pam

I cannot quite deal with your bit here, Eric. If I did, I would give up my
right to vote, stack an arsenal under our bed, put all persons of any color
other than certifiable white in a 'secure' neighborhood, and go to David
Horowitz' new education channel for the schooling of my children.
We would more than occasionally have public burnings of those offensive
'prayer rugs', etc.
And I would have voted straight Republican tickets last Wednesday.

I think your wisdom is now on the table.

Personally, and collectively, I think we have had enough.

Yes, time for a new course.

Eric,

I'm certainly not as "hard left" as most of the people
who are vocal concerning politics on this List, though
I have extreme leftist dreams of what "the end of
prehistory" and the beginning of a liveable society
would look like, but I must say that it is strange and
appalling to me to hear that the willingness to be
"brutal enough" is what is important for USAmerican
security.  Let alone inspecting all shipping
containers, the Bush Regime is not even translating
and reading and studying all the mail being sent out
of jail cells by convicted terrorists.  These are
evidently not things that make them feel like
relentless merciless tough guys, while torture, and
mining all internet communication, does make them feel
that way. I cannot believe that *more* of the same (in
both senses of the word) is the answer.

Why do you say, in another post, that Venezuela is one
of the challenges our military faces?  Why would you
even dream for a moment of overturning the Chavez
regime simply because you don't approve of it?  He may
not be as admirable as the Hard Left thinks, and I
hate his total solidarity with today's Iranian regime,
but ultimately that's an issue for Venezuelans.

All this said, if other people can comment about
politics on this List so can you, and I fervently hope
you don't get 'Kirby'd' into silence by those who have
placed you in their "bestiary". What you said about
Mossadegh dissolving the Iranian parliament before the
American strike against him will make me soon go back
and look at the history further--I only know certain
leftist formulas about what occurred, e.g. Allen
Ginsberg's rhyming lines about how what we did to
Mossadegh led to our having to endure "Khomeini's
drek". The airing of differing opinions DOES lead to
the statement of interesting facts/allegations that
need to be investigated.  (That last sentence makes me
a "knave"--in terms of Blake's statement about people
who proudly explain the obvious :)

Probably be more like it was here in the UK -- for once we were ahead of
you -- 18 bloody years of the Hag of Grantham followed by the Grey Man.
Then a landslide, and what do we get?  The Smile and his Nu Labour Fiasco.
Still and all, even Blair and his Boyos and Girls are better than the blue
(rinse) brigade.

On the other hand, the probable next prime minister of Great Britain wrote
his PhD thesis on, and then published a biography of, James Maxon, one of
the leaders of Red Clyde in the twenties, than which there were few redder.
Might mean something.

Actually, the problem is that you got stuck with a President who is not
simply a religious maniac but also incredibly stupid.  What really does my
head in is how he seems to get away with suggesting that he is *competent to
wage the "war" on terror.  There weren't that many options open to *any
American president in the wake of 9/11, and it's difficult to imagine any
of them not going into Afghanistan.  That arguably could be described as a
war, since the Taliban were actively harbouring and encouraging bin Laden,
not like the bubble-and-froth around Iraq, Iran and Pakistan.

Then it started, and my jaw dropped.  Sure, it would have been be impossible
to completely seal the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, but it looked as if no
effort whatsoever was being made.  Did Bush trust his good-buddy General
Musharraf to do the job for him?  Angels wept, talk about naiveté!

Then, of course, having started in Afghanistan, with a proper UN resolution,
a genuine multinational force, and virtually the whole world on his side,
Bush decides to withdraw, essentially, all American troops from Afghanistan,
with a botched job unfinished, and attack one of the few Middle Eastern
countries which, despite being pretty much a foul dictatorship, was strongly
anti-Islamic-fundamentalist.

And so it went on.

That's leaving the morality of the various actions undertaken or not to one
side, which is sort-of like ignoring the elephant in the room.  Virtually
ANYONE would have done it better than Bush, Colin Powell probably best of
all, but all it needed was to keep an eye on the ball and stick to
Afghanistan.  So what does Bush do?  Ho, hum.

Then ...  Beneath the terminology, the US is confronting the problem as if
it *were a war, while the UK, Europe, and I'd guess the rest of the world is
treating it as criminal activity to be solved by police action, a more
appropriate way of confronting this particular issue.

What I'm frightened about -- hell, I couldn't give a tinker's curse whether
or not Iran goes nuclear, since what the hell would they actually *do with a
bomb? -- is the amount of loose nuclear material floating around what was
once the USSR, and apparently open to bids from anyone with hard cash.  When
the first dirty bomb goes off, and it probably will, it will be constructed
from that.

[Guess who withdrew American funding from the program to help sequester
nuclear materials in the former USSR?]

And it won't be an act of war, it'll be a criminal act, like so many others,
like the Omagh bombing here in 1998.  Neither will it be The End of
Civilisation As We Know It.  It won't even be as bad a Chernobyl, which is
easily the longest lasting nuclear incident to date, accident rather than
"terrorist outrage", and has rendered large stretches of the Ukraine
uninhabitable for the forseeable future.

But the world goes on.

At least it did, the last I heard.

Ah, it'll all come out in the wash.  Even if, worst case scenario, Dubya
decides to celebrate the end of his tenure in the White House by pushing the
shiny red button, there'll probably be someone there to stop him.

And if not, probably the birds won't fly back, as the USSR no longer has the
capability to deliver at long range.

Things have been worse, nearer the edge -- think the Cuban crisis -- with
what would have been larger consequences.  (Nuclear winter, anyone?).

Bad enough, but not quite tembling-in-one's-socks time.

Unless you happen to live in Bagdad, outside the Green Zone.

Robin

Norwich School of Art and Design in 1998. Each day's writing would be
transcribed on that day and placed in multiples, available for free, via an
in tray in the cubicle into which my narrowcasts arrived." (from cheek's

onPlantarchy 1:

"If you are looking for single-subject enclosures that tenderly bathe the
tired feet of your brain then don't bother because Plantarchy is no soothin=
g
balm, it is jagged and intellectually raw, full of unashamed avant energy.
More to the point though, the material here is uniformly excellent, in fact
I don't think I've come across a #1 of a magazine with such a rich and
satisfying selection of texts."

James<http://theunderfoot.blogspot.com/2006/07/plantarchy.html>on
Plantarchy
1:
"A new poetry magazine with this title carries the motto 'each molecule an
orchid', and no pious Green-ness is suggested by shocking pink covers . . .
There seems to be a sense of spawning . . . in quite a lot of the work in
this issue, a strongly generative emphasis or drive, but also a shaping
aesthetic that results (for instance) in really nice, clean production and
editorial choices . . . I've enjoyed reading everything in this excellently
produced and edited magazine  . . ."

Steven: I think your wisdom is now on the table. Personally,

Eric:  I was just explaining how I felt. You know ... as in
feelings? I wrote an honest report of how I felt.

"We have had ..."? That you pompously offer collective
judgment shows that I was mistaken to write to you. You
don't have the integrity to simply speak for yourself, and
probably also lack the courage to write about your real
feelings ... especially if they run counter to a group

You note, Eric, I qualified my statement by "I think we have had enough.
Not "personally and collectively, we have had enough" - even if the National
vote seems to verify such.

I honor and would always support your courage and right to say what you
want.
It's just what you say and what you want, I find to be off the charts,
dangerous in fact. As was that man R whose own military finally got to leave
the table.

"Without contraries, no progression" -  Eric,you  are doing your part of the
job.
Thank you.

Sorry, Alex, I only meant to say that it seems to me of very little =20
importance whether the world thinks more or less of the US; the =20
problem lies with the US and its behaviour. It might be better, in =20
fact, for the peoples of the world if they regarded the US with =20
greater suspicion (if not hatred) than they already do. And if I used =20=

"you" when referring to US military adventures it's because it seems =20
to me that, if people continue to believe in their political system, =20
and see it as a democratic expression of the popular view, and defend =20=

it as such on this list, they should assume the actions of their =20
government as their own. If Americans began to feel truly responsible =20=

for the actions of their elected officials (regardless of whether =20
they voted for them or not), then perhaps there might be a greater =20
sense of urgency to their resistance, strategic or tactical...

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday

By Liza Featherstone

I've received some sad news. The writer Ellen Willis,
one of my heroes, died this morning of lung cancer,
much too young (64). I will miss her lucid thinking
about culture and politics, bracing scorn for
sentimental obfuscation (whether from the right or the
left), radical vision of a better society and gift for
the art of writing.

Though Willis wholeheartedly participated in sixties
counterculture, she wrote incisively about its
foolishness. A policeman's daughter, she described
demonstrators' cop-hating as "another pretense that
white bohemians and radicals are as oppressed as ghetto
blacks," and "fierce bohemian contempt for all those
slobs who haven't seen the light."

A founding member of Redstockings, Willis was an
articulate champion of seventies radical feminism, but
wrote equally well about the pleasure-hating eighties,
with its drug wars, censorship and the rise of the
"right to life" movement. She was deeply committed to a
vision of love between free people, and through that
lens, the social control decade took on a fresh
desolation. She was eloquent about the extent to which
fear of the libido not only energized the evangelical
far right but had permeated feminism. Writing about
feminist anti-porn crusades, she urged women not to
"accept a spurious moral superiority as a substitute
for sexual pleasure, and curbs on men's sexual freedom
as a substitute for real power." Yet she admitted that
the sexual radicals like herself didn't have all the
answers, and had "failed to put forth a convincing
analysis of sexual violence, exploitation and
alienation."

Writing during this period, she created an alter ego
for herself -- and anyone else trying to live a
passionate life in hostile times -- an alienated
character called Ruby Tuesday, periodically adrift from
a cohesive community or social movement, asserting
deviant desires in a culture that pretends we all want
the same things.

But despite Willis's sense of isolation and libertarian
commitment to the individual -- both of which pervade
her writing in every era -- she never lost sight of the
importance of social movements: "The struggle for
freedom, pleasure, transcendence is not just an
individual matter. The social system that...as far as
possible channels our desires, is antagonistic to that
struggle; to change this requires collective effort."

Like her character Ruby Tuesday, who ends up seducing
reporters who come to interview her, Willis was boldly
optimistic about the transformative powers of desire,
and the threateningly political implications of
happiness. "The power of the ecstatic moment," she
writes, "This is what freedom is like, this is what
love could be, this is what happens when the boundaries
are gone -- is precisely the power to reimagine the
world, to reclaim a human identity that's neither
victim nor oppressor."

Like many feminists of my generation, I revered Ellen
Willis and have been deeply influenced by her writing.
I didn't know her well as a person, however. Once at a
party, I decided I had to talk to her, and tell her how
much I admired her work. She seemed mortified, though
not altogether displeased. After that, whenever we'd
run into each other, she was pleasant enough, but
always shy and awkward. I would often see her circling
a party alone, apparently not finding anyone she was
inclined to chat with, or any cluster she wanted to
join. Still, I'm glad I got to tell her that I was a
huge fan. I hope she enjoyed hearing that, at least a
little bit.

(I should admit, I'm plagiarizing myself somewhat. I've
written about Ellen Willis's work before, in a "What
Are They Reading?" on the Nation's website, and in a
review of her 1993 book No More Nice Girls, the first
piece I ever wrote for the Nation, which ran in the
magazine October 4 of that year.)

I recently came across a copy of Man Ray's and Paul Elouard's book Facile,
featuring Elouard's fragmented if consistently erotic poetry alongside Man
Ray's nudes.and it set me to wondering whether poets and photographers
nowadays are combining poetry with photography in book form in an
interesting way. I can think of Malanga's and Warhol's Screen Tests / A
Diary, for example, and am aware of poet/photographer Tim Davis, but what's
been done since, say, the early 1970s that actually combines photo with
poem? I've done little internet searches and come across books like Janet
Sternberg's Optic Nerve: Poems with Photographs and Walt McDonald's Great
Lonely Places of the Texas Plains (which feature McDonald's poems paired
with color photos by photographer Wyman Meinzer), but these pair image with
text in a conventional and, to my mind, pretty dull way - that is, image is
there to resonate or echo with the theme / narrative of the poem.a poem is
"about" a Texas plain and - lo! - there is a pretty picture of a Texas plain
alongside it.anything more ambitious in scope that I should know about?

We publish Hannah Weiner's Weeks with photographs by Barbara
Rosenthal.  In this case I believe Hannah created the text first &
the photos were shot to accompany the text.

Much more recent is a project by Camille Bacos, Maria Damon & myself
called "The End".  In this project the photos (& digital video) were
created first & Maria & I attempt to animate the imagery by invoking
the voices of 19th century spiritualism.  A version of it can be
viewed here:

of note, we recently got this up on dworkin's eclipse site (plus! there's
lots of bernstein/bee productions of similar nature):
http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/OCCURRENCE/html/contents.shtml

generally, it would prove helpful to root around artist's book stores (read:
printed matter online). you'll find a virtually unlimited array of
words&photos. also, you could check out some granary press issues, off the
top i can think of a beautiful _en famile_ with creeley/dorfman & the
utterly incredible _debtor's prison_ by warsh/harrison.

I am interested in the fact that you brought this up tonight, because I
was out gallery-hopping tonight, which included looking at the works of
photographers, and I found myself in a conversation with a photographer
about poetry and photography.  As one who is also interested in
photography, I'm considering ways to make photographs that also work
with my poetry.

What I'm finding when I speak to visual artists on the whole-- painters
as well as photographers-- is that they aren't as interested in mixing
poetry with visual art, as their idea is that poetry seeks to define
their work.  I don't see it that way myself, as my poetry, in my own
opinion, doesn't seek to do that, but I am struggling with finding
visual artists to collaborate with me.

Although, I did speak to that photographer tonight who understood a
connection between the two, although I'm not sure I necessarily agreed
with his viewpoint entirely.

Meet The Press: "Classroom Economics of Fugitive Reproduction"

Some informal survey questions for teachers and teachers-to-be,
questions typed out at lightning speed, so I hope to return to this
in conversation or in further writing. Sorry if it's malformed or
just unclear what I'm asking, but these questions have been on my
mind for a while, and I'm writing here thinking through, looking for
some feedback from the people on this list who buy books and are
educators and who use contemporary small press productions as part of
their course content. My survey questions appear at the bottom.

Recently at Factory School we were discussing the issue of our
"copyright" statement, which allows for "collective" and "personal"
reproduction as long as it is not part of any financial transaction.
This seems important and useful to have straight. A lot of people are
worried about copyright. It seems to me that the actual ownership of
the capital outcome of the reproduction of a text is not necessarily
linked to any legal rights. For example,  while many colleges and
print shops do seek permission or collect fees for such permissions,
some do not. (We've never seen any fees, by the way. I think you have
to be a corporation to send around those special people to pick up
the bags of money.)  I have mixed feelings, of course, as a pirate
and a publisher, but I guess, as a rule, I'm against having to ask,
though it makes a difference to the bottom line of a press teetering
on the brink. The author receives all the benefits of "fugitive"
reproduction (which I engage in myself, so I'm raising it as a
question, not simply crying about it as a publisher). For the author
"being taught"  the exposure and attention can be very significant.
A great research project would examine course syllabi nationwide,
studying then book sales and fugitive reproductions--It seems a
poetry research group might step forward to manage the collection of
such data.

At Factory School we faced a question about this, whether to grant
free access for a for-educational-purposes reproduction of a
substantial section of a Factory School book.  Given that our mission
is largely anti-corporate (read: anti-capitalist), and that
information wants to be free, or something to that effect, and also
not wanting to intervene in a teacher's need to get a certain text to
her/his class with minimal hassle, we granted this right. As far as I
know we've never been asked before, though I know things are usually
done on the fly, etc.. But you can imagine--as a struggling small
press currently still deeply in the red--how torn we are by such a
concern.  On the one hand, we were outraged that our labor and
capital would be negated in the casual free-exchange of information
at a "college" or "university (whether pubic or private, facts which
themselves rests on some pretty, ahem, major capitalization:  nothing
like state power for access to the machinery of reproduction and to
cobble up everything towards the completion of this statutory
purpose). That is, the use in a classroom, while beneficent itself,
is still a "financial transaction" in that the machinery of the
bureaucracy involved rests on a great deal of financial wherewithal,
even if it is concealed by the good-will of the distribution of "hand-
outs" to students. In addition, the "exchange" in the classroom is
also a sort of financial transaction.  One might argue that "giving"
anything to students is a problem, whether it be information,
knowledge, learning in general (I say that of course with tongue
firmly in cheek).  On the other hand, to deny reproduction rights to
the people who bothered to ask is to punish one of our authors, who
will certainly benefit from the free-circulation of works written for
publication. But it's about publication. Often the people teaching
the works know the authors, so why not just bypass publication and go
"straight to the student" and thus minimize all expense and risk of
the publisher?  It shows that really there is more going on here than
the "free flow of information" --

Often the initial book production is just the first step in the
development of further capital, whether social or "real".  Sometimes
authors are asked to pitch in through subvention--one of the rarely
discussed engines of the poetry economy--but often the small presses
bear all the "risk."  It would be interesting to look at how "risk"
is distributed among small presses: which ones gather up from a
subculture or a "new generation" and ones which publish more
established writers.  Anyhow, if one of the things that is "produced"
here is "careers" (and I don't mean jobs so much as reputations,
social value and particular commodities that represent that social
power and position), then might might one think about this in
reverse--or at least be transparent that this is the particular
project of "publication" -- indeed, as bloggers have shown, "success"
in terms of readership can be generated online, such cultural capital
usually then spent on "wasteful" forms of production in terms of
bricks-and-mortar "books."  This happens and reaches it's apex, at
some level, with what they call "course adoptions."   This is one of
the reasons, presumably, that SPD is emphasizing the pedagogical
value of its stock, and as they highlight this fact the hope is that
more educators will use SPD for adopting books.

The question then becomes, "which books to order" and then it's like
looking at a menu. I'd like some of this and some of that.  Often
these books are too expensive for students at public schools, so
maybe you pick an anthology and then xerox the rest.  Perhaps there
is some book, by that really terrific younger poet, that should be
taught, and so it is, for a semester until the next best thing comes
along...  I don't see that as a problem, actually, but just wondering
about this process.  At Factory School, we are developing a
"textbook" series that will work otherwise, addressing some of the
concerns mentioned here and others not mentioned here.

To this end, here are some questions. Please, if you can, take some
time to answer them. Each question has multiple parts and I'm looking
for elaborated responses, not just facts or answers, so feel free to
just engage with them at any level.   Please respond to me off-list
or here on-list. I think that other people would be interested to
know this information.

Thanks.


Survey:

1. What is your process for determining what you xerox and what you
make students purchase? What are the ratios/amounts of these, on
average, per course?

2.  How much should anyone have to pay for a book--of, say--100
pages? 150? 200?   What is a book's value relative to other things?
Should books have different costs depending on their use value? And
what would that be? What should determine a book's cost?  What is an
appropriate pricing scheme?  Brent Cunningham at SPD once suggested
that such a scheme would look like at least 4x cost.

3.  What book -- that does not exist -- would you like to see
available for teaching purposes?

Thanks much for this good analysis of copyright and its current limitations,
Joel. It definitely deserves more than one read.
In terms of the "fugitive" text (and its loss of control and income by
publishers) I have this suggestion. In terms of Factory School (and other
small press publishers) - you might (if you have not) look into ebrary:
(www.ebrary.com), a company I worked for a few years back, one that has
survived the dot com bust and has begun to flourish particularly in both
national and international academic library markets.
It is totally PDF based and easy for publishers to make contract with and
supply.
Library's - through a new ebrary partnership with Blackwell - can buy ebook
versions - i.e., PDFs of any title.
However the ebrary technology enables library researchers and students
(including professors who are assigning particular chapters or pages from a
text, for example) to download the pages for reprint, complete with
bibiliographic notations. Ebrary research technology also enables the
cross-searching of their whole database of now over a 100,000 titles. Search
could be by name of poet, a particular line of a particular poem, etc. etc.
The economic model varies (and please do not take my paraphrase of services
here as Biblic) but ebrary's system is designed to protect copyright and
compensate publishers for use and re-use of material. Smart contracts with
publishers will also keep authors in the income stream.

Like any system, I am sure ebrary's model(s) for publishers will have pros
and cons - but it is certainly a system that may provide many small presses
to participate in a global and local digital publishing interface -
maximizing while defining the terms of exposure and adding an income stream.

Anyway, all this info can be found by going to their website at:

Joel, as you know, I teach as an adjunct, and not the same class
consistently (although the most common class is an "intro to lit" class
that doubles as a second-level writing class), and I don't entirely get to
determine what texts I teach. Still, I've had some choices. First, I have
to admit I partly teach texts I want to teach, and often these are not
within the prescribed anthology. Once I put together an entire 100-page
booklet of photocopied works, some done fugitively, some with permission.
What I did not have was permission from my chairperson & dean. I knew I was
possibly inviting their displeasure. And indeed they were displeased when
they found out (all photocopying was done at department expense), although
they allowed it this one time, but said, "not again."

More "average" is that I have about 25 - 40 pages of photocopied works per
semester. This semester such works include two poems by Emily Dickinson not
in the anthology, about 20 pages of H.D.'s Trilogy (the entire first book,
collapsed a bit for space), and a very few scattered other things. One
theme in the class has to do with responses to war. I'm also stressing the
development of modernism, and works by women writers. This amount of
photocopying is within limits of departmental guidelines, or at least it
doesn't seem to bother anyone.

So I guess my "process" is to develop a syllabus each semester, one that
makes sense with as few photocopied pages as possible, but to not hesitate
to include 25 or so photocopied pages, different each semester depending on
the syllabus.

This semester, for the first time, I added to the required anthology by
requesting a novel (something else that generally isn't taught in these
intro classes). I tried to save the students some overall money, then, by
photocopying what they needed from style sheet manual rather than requiring
them to purchase such a manual.

>pages? 150? 200?   What is a book's value relative to other things?

This is a difficult one to answer. What is the book? What are the
circumstances of its production? If your 4x works, and it costs $1000 to
$1500 to produce 300 copies of a book (which I think is extremely low even
for on-demand printing if shipping, design costs, overhead, etc., are
figured in) of 100 pages, then a cost of about $14 to $20 is right, and
that seems reasonable to me. Hence the cost of most recent Chax Press books
at $14 or $16. Quite obviously, then, if you could sell 2500 copies of a
book, you would go to offset printing, and the unit cost per book would go
down somewhat. Then the question is, would you significantly lower the
price of the book. That's tricky, because if you price a book lower than
other books that are similar to it, there's the possibility of an attitude
that the book is "worth its price," plus distributors like SPD seem to
prefer books to be $14 or more, if at all possible. I imagine bookstores
would rather carry the $14 poetry book than the $8 poetry book -- but I am
speculating here.

I'd like to hear what Brent is considering as "cost" when he says "4x cost"
-- obviously printing/binding, but is he counting design fees (or
estimation of such fees if the design is done in-house?), is he considering
a portion of overhead (rent, utilities, etc.?), is he considering a portion
of administrative costs of the press?, is he considering shipping costs
(both shipping books from printer/binder to the press, shipping individual
books to buyers, in-process-print shipping, often via express mail, or
proofs, corrections, etc.?), is he considering art costs if there is art on
the cover or inside (or estimation of such fees if the art is either
donated or created in-house?), is he considering costs of office supplies
used in developing the book (paper, laser or inkjet ink, & misc.
supplies)?, is he considering warehousing or other storage costs?, or other
such costs I have not even managed to cover here?, is he considering
partial salaries, or other money for time compensation (whether actually
paid or not?) to editors and others involved with creating the book?, is he
considering cost of royalties, whether paid in cash or in author copies
(and at what percentage are those copies valued?). I guess what I am
getting at is, depending on how "cost" is determined, it's quite possible
that my $14 to $20 above is a ridiculously low figure for "4x cost."

That said, what's the book's value? I guess the people who buy it (market?,
audience?) in part determine that. I recently bought Robin Blaser's The
Holy Forest (hardcover), and it retails at $45. Is it worth that to me?
Yes, absolutely. Yet, actually, I bought it at a discount, for a little
less than $30. So is it "really" worth $30? If a paperback comes out at $25
or so, but you can find similar discounts that allow you to purchase it for
$18 or so, what is its value? And is a paperback really worth $20 less than
a hardcover version to begin with? And if the author of the book is Joel
Kuszai or Bill Marsh or Charles Alexander or Kari Edwards or Linda Russo
(same number of pages, same production values), is that worth any more or
less than the name Robin Blaser? How much more or less? To whom?

How real, then, can such questions be? "Use value" to whom? To the greatest
number of people? To an average number of some identified core audience for
a particular book? To the average American? To the average book buyer
worldwide?

I'm interested in how and whether you are able to take answers you get and
come up with something that approaches a hard & fast set of guidelines for
pricing books. I just don't know if it's possible, except within some
perhaps widely varying parameters.


>3.  What book -- that does not exist -- would you like to see
>available for teaching purposes?


A long poem anthology, with either whole poems or significant parts, to be
used instead of, or in conjunction with, the introductory literary
anthologies that either have no poems more than 4 or 5 pages (i.e. the
length of Prufrock or of Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey). Include a bit of
critical apparatus, but not that much. I'd like such a book to be at least
300 pages, and possibly more like 600, and to be priced at $40 or less
(paperback, but I'd understand if it had to be more), and to include work
from classic epics of various languages (translated), right up to works
written in the last twenty years. Obviously, it couldn't have more than two
or three sections of Pound's Cantos, or Blau DuPlessis's Drafts, or Olson's
Maximus, or Notley's Disobedience -- but what a difference it could make to
general student understanding of what constitutes a poem!

There may be lots of other books I could imagine, but that's the one for today.

Charles

Ok, Thanks Charles, that was great.  That's helpful even, so I'm
going to burn up my second post to the list for the day by responding
and clarifying a couple of the questions by refusing to clarify them.

First off, I must say I may be mis-representing Brent, so let him
come in and clarify. But since he was speaking with me (via email)
about our operation, which is very much virtual in that we don't, as
Chax does, I'd guess, or some other established presses, have much
overhead at all.  At least not directly in that we're not even
renting a PO Box right now.  So I think that he meant by that actual
costs, not total costs.  You're right.  I don't think his formula was
generic, but he was telling me for US that is what he would
recommend, at least.   Obviously, it doesn't always work like that
and I don't think he intended -- and I apologize if I gave the wrong
idea -- that to stand as a "rule" --

Mostly, I was looking for the kind of information that you then
provided, but you asked me many questions I don't have answers for,
and so my "surveying" people was to find out.  Did you mean what it
sounded like:  Certain poets' books are worth more?  I'm not sure
Robin's book is worth 45, nor 30, not any more than your book would
be.  Am I willing to pay it?  Perhaps... But I didn't and would not
say that it is worth it.

But what I do gather is that you seem to suggest that certain books
can be charged with the responsibility to cover some other costs that
are coded as losses in  other books, such as books sold for the low
end of your 14 - 20 range, which can hardly bear to cover their own
costs, not that of the whole operation.  So. Thanks for that prompt
to clear that up.  I think Brent was referring to just actual
production costs.

As far as the "value" -- I'm trying to figure that out.  You write as
if I asked already knowing the answer. I'm trying to understand this,
not to come up with a fixed scheme, but to provide a model for the
reorganization of publishing as a "business" for the production of
decorative commodities.  Use value is a funny term, but lets say that
books one is "required" to buy for a class, would have a high "use
value" (regardless of their content) than one purchased as
distraction, entertainment, or simply to purge of excess funds.  I
don't want to imply that some books have greater use value in terms
of what they say/contain, but rather their occupation in social,
material terms.  This isn't nefarious nor innocuous only, so I'm
trying to understand a structural condition, not single out certain
kinds of content.  To me, content is almost entirely arbitrary at
this point.  Not irrelevant, but arbitrary.

So, please, this is a survey--I'm not assuming the answers to any of
these, and I think the questions do work if you just answer them
without trying to wonder what I intend to get.  You did a great job
of answering the questions and already have given me a lot to think
about.  Stephen as well... I have to return to a more quotidian task,
and have now burned up my two entries for the day.   I'll follow
along if there is any follow-up and will return tomorrow with any
needed responses.  Of course, I'll be available for individual
clarifications, etc.   --  and of course Bill, who is also interested
this, may have something to say, too.

thanks for the fascinating thread; there are so many important things here

has anyone tried selling eBooks?  I know I've got some which are free in
their .pdf format (and if you want MS Reader or whatever, I'm willing to
convert the files for you), it might be interesting to see if copies sell as
eBooks -- I know Soft Skull tried that with an anthology a while back, and
some of the giant publishers play around with it -- but because of the
difficulty of getting, um, erotic and political work in some countries,
electronically formatted erotica sells like hotcakes, and I would think
political writing worth a try (especially with a saucy cover and title)

Also, for DaDaDa and I think for Locket, I did the whole "reading group
discussion questions" thing at Amazon, B&N, I thought it was fun; made me
think of all those idiot discussion questions at the end of poems in certain
teaching anthologies.  I know that Tupelo is starting to put together and
sell study guides, starting with one for Annie Finch's Calendars which goes
into the forms and such.  I love the free online study guide thing when
teaching; all the major anthologies like Heath, a lot of the comp readers,
etc., have them; I use a lot of them even though I'm not teaching from the
anthology and I even have uploaded some of my stuff to them.  In my more
enthusiastic moments, I feel that it gives students a feeling that they are
not isolated in reading x essay and writing a five paragraph theme on it.
At the very least, it gives them different points of view and approaches
than I offer.  So I think everyone's book of poetry and series of books
should have study guides that're free.  And they can be study guides as
poems or whatever, but I think it is a great format.  Also then one could
collect syllabi for courses which used the book.

when I teach, I have always xeroxed like mad, but only stuff that's
allowable; Antioch is one school that makes up readers in advance & they say
they do the permissions -- they charge the students as though they've done
the permissions -- so I would definitely contact Antioch (especially the
branch campuses, not Yellow Springs) to try to collect

I try to teach a mix of books that are available free online and in paper,
and books that must be purchased.  I always try to find the cheapest
possible editions of the books.  I find that most students buy the paper
copies of everything (there's a small book grant here that's easy to get),
but there's always a group grateful that the books don't cost more than the
course, and it good to have some texts that students have absolutely no
financial excuse for not having read.

I want to mention that since I taught a great deal online, there was an
especial problem when the cc district stopped buying the fat client.  Links
to online materials never get followed; students at least a year ago still
wanted everything to be available in nice, specially formatted files inside
the bounds of the course site.  Uh, so there was a grey area, because one
can link to a lot of things one can't legally reproduce electronically.  I
am lucky in that the LAPL subscribes to proquest, all of the Gale things,
and Grangers for all card holders, so I required my students to have a
public library card, and then I could use all of those essays, poems, and
whatnot.

Also, Sentence and a *very few* other journals are in Grangers.  More should
be.  More should also be in Proquest.

   I think the corporate press "textbook" anthology is a bad deal for
students, although I have been forced to use one which was really fine (it
had well known essays which were available in whole or in part online or
through proquest, and so I could feed those to students who didn't have the
book), and found another one.

One of the reasons it is a bad deal is that it doesn't show students that
information comes in newspapers, magazines, journals, and books.  They think
it comes in prepackaged anthologies if that's all they've seen.

Even a reader isn't good if you tend to maniacally adjust the course reading
to the students during the course.

Robert,
Apology accepted, and thank you for clarifying.
Continuing to believe in my political system? That's
another issue entirely, and I won't repeat my thoughts
on what "representative government" consists of in
this country. As for the rest, the call for resistance
is welcome, and heard, I'm sure.
Yours,
Alex

For the purposes of this survey, I'll limit my responses to those courses in
which I include some amount of contemporary poetry (as opposed, say, to my
early modern courses, in which I generally just use the Norton Anthology,
Pelican Shakespeare paperbacks, etc.).  I try to keep my students' costs for
a single course under $100--well under, if possible.  Typically, if I'm
teaching a poetry creative writing course or a contemporary poetry lit
course, I'll assign a book by each of the guests, if there are any, in the
Emergent Forms reading series that I curate.  This usually amounts to three
or four single-author books a quarter.  In addition, I may require an
anthology or other textbook: as an example of a variation on this formula,
last spring I taught a course entitled "Beat to Postmodern" in which I
assigned Allen's New American Poetry (UC Press), Silliman's In the American
Tree (Natl. Poetry Assn.), Peter Gizzi's Some Values of Landscape and
Weather (Wesleyan UP), and Rodney Koeneke's Musee Mechanique (BlazeVox [a
POD publisher]).  That may have neared or passed the $100 mark, I'm not
sure.  I usually also distribute a good number of handouts, usually of two
or three poems each, or of short poetics essays or excerpts.  I have
assigned entire photocopied readers on occasion, but have ultimately found
the process too frustrating for one reason or another.

2.  How much should anyone have to pay for a book--of, say--100
> pages? 150? 200?   What is a book's value relative to other things?
> Should books have different costs depending on their use value? And

I just don't know.  This is why I'm not on the marketing end of things.  The
use value question is interesting, and makes me want to expound freely, but
not in ways that would be of much help here, I suspect.  I'm trying to think
how one might gauge use value in poetry books, beyond a) how
good/interesting/provocative the poems are; b) how accurately and
inclusively the books, if anthologies or textbooks, represent the field with
which they are concerned; and c) the inclusion of helpful supplementary
study materials of the kind Catherine mentions in her response to this
survey.  Consideration a) is too subjective to yield useful standards for
pricing; consideration b) invites the absurdly cynical reverse formula that
books containing inaccurate and incomplete representation should cost less;
and c) seems bound up in totally dependent ways with a) and b).  I guess
that leaves quality of materials: acid-free paper, durable binding, readable
type, etc., considerations which may or may not be paramount priorities for
any given student and/or instructor in a given instance.

3.  What book -- that does not exist -- would you like to see
> available for teaching purposes?


One that I'm currently working on a manuscript for, and therefore don't want
to say too much about, except that it will attempt to satisfy some of the
criteria Catherine brings up, as well as remedying what I consider the
current lack of any general poetry anthology/textbook that offers a good
selection of both canonical and contemporary poetry.  (Koch's Making Your
Own Days comes close, but it stops with the New York School, and Poetry for
Dummies is in many ways excellent, but the packaging and layout is a bit
off-putting.)

hi--it looks like photographer rusty crump & I will have a book, both an
ebook and a printed book, with blazevox.com--the ebook is on the website at
the moment. It's my small synaesthetic dream prose poems and photos, and
rusty's wonderful pix some of which have my words superimposed on them. the
idea for me is to show how dream life & waking life overlap. enjoy. it's
nearly 300 pp but you can breeze through it.

Dear Joel,
       I'll answer with regard to my 3rd year course in Contemporary
American Poetry, which
Ordinarily has an enrollment of about 40 students.=20

Survey:

1. What is your process for determining what you xerox and what you =20
make students purchase? What are the ratios/amounts of these, on =20
average, per course?

There is one prescribed text: Paul Hoover's Norton Anthology of
Postmodern
Poetry. That is supplemented by xeroxed material which is not compiled
in a'book' but handed
out class by class. This is because I want to refer to this material in
the lecture and enable
students to annotate it during class, or take it home and read it as a
follow up to the lecture.
(If I do not need this to happen I use a video camera projection
of the text.) My guess is amounts to about the same as Stephen's 25-40
pages. Some poems,
Extracts of, are mixed in with some sections of essays, interviews.
Permissions are not
sought.
As time goes by I xerox less. We have an on-line system on which we can
post texts of poems
alongside reading lists, bibliographies, etc. I make increasing use of
ther course site.
I make constant and specific reference to the EPC And PennSound
resources and use them by going on-line in class.=20

Most of my own books I make available during office hours to students in
a course 'library'--a cupboard in a study room (the books cannot leave
that room)
Students will sometimes buy their own copies of books (via Amazon
usually) they read there (in New Zealand there are not book
shops that stock any of the poets I teach). The course more or less
requires them to spend significant time
in this room, and before exams or  assignments falling due it serves as
a discussion centre.   =20

=20


2. =20

How much should anyone have to pay for a book--of, say--100 =20
pages? 150? 200?   What is a book's value relative to other things? =20
Should books have different costs depending on their use value? And =20
what would that be? What should determine a book's cost?  What is an =20
appropriate pricing scheme?  Brent Cunningham at SPD once suggested =20
that such a scheme would look like at least 4x cost.

=20

3.  What book -- that does not exist -- would you like to see =20
available for teaching purposes?

Although the Hoover is serviceable,it is too wide-ranging in time and
taste for my
Purposes. I want to focus on the last 25 years, and on more 'difficult'
poetry.

Wystan=20

I always make my own readers, usually within the fair use model more-or-less, but I also don't teach poetry classes, so am often making readers on the fly for specific multi-disciplinary contexts. Which I like to do - but it is a lot of sacrificial labor to ask from teachers. So here's my latest idea - I'm assuming some computer-savvy person would know how to do this -
you have a website that contains works & critical essays from numerous writers - way more than could fit in a conventional anthology. Each teacher can log in, pick the texts they want to use for their course, and the website will a) collect them into one volume, b) create a table of contents, etc., c) calculate the fees for POD printing and copyright fees, whatever, and then d) you can order however many you need, print on demand. Perhaps costs would be prohibitive, but I'm not sure - plus the site could offer other pedagogical tools like wikis and constellatory (sp?) links that suggest non-conventional groupings/anthologies. so that choosing, say, a poem by baraka might prompt a series of possible 'next moves' - to olson, to the last poets, to an essay by AB Spellman, etc...
I was thinking of starting a mag like this - where you would click on 6-8 texts from a possible 25, let's say, on a website, then the site would put those into a pdf file that you can print out, fold and staple into your own zine, 'co-edited' by you & me. but then i dont know how to do this, and like to pretend that some nerd will help me make it happen for cheap...
ideas?

Greetings all:

My apologies for crossposting.

I posted a message like this about a year ago, and I'm sending it out again.
I received some great responses from everyone then and I'd like to try to
continue to hold this informal survey, the results of which I will again
post on my blog. Any comments and flack gladly accepted...

I'm curious about which are your most respected venues for online and print
poetry publication.

To where do you return regularly? Without which sites can't you live?

Please send your responses backchannel and thanks in advance!

Dear friend,

Publishing is generally considered to be a big money business. But the
fact is most small presses struggle to make ends meet. For an unabash-
edly feminist and progressive publisher like Red Letter Press, the situation
is even harder. Though non-profit and staffed entirely by volunteers, Red
Letter Press is too political to be a charity. This makes us ineligible
for the
grants and arts funding that some publishers can obtain.

However, this is also our strength. We don't tailor our texts to suit phil-
anthropists or grant requirements. Red Letter Press boldly brings critical
thinking and alternative political viewpoints to the public. We keep our
costs low, low, low in order to publish important works at prices ordinary
people can afford.

We are asking your help for our next project, Viva la Raza: A History of
Chicano Identity and Resistance, by Yolanda Alaniz and Megan Cornish.
The book evaluates strategies for liberation that are of vital importance to
today's Chicano militants organizing against racist attacks on immigrants
and Latinos as a whole. The authors investigate the much-debated
question of the racial or national character of Chicano oppression. They
examine the lessons of Raza insurgency from the time of conquest
through the 20th century, paying special attention to the role of women in
every historical period.

For the last year, Alaniz and Cornish have been working with Monthly
Review Press to publish the book. But after initially approving the
manuscript, the editors decided it was too brazen in its opinions and
precipitously broke the publishing agreement. Red Letter Press has
proudly stepped up to publish the work despite our limited resources.

Please help us put these important ideas before the public by donating
$50 or $100, or whatever amount you can. Rest assured that 100% of your
donation will go toward publication of Viva la Raza. Your gift can be
mailed to Red Letter Press, 4710 University Way #100, Seattle, WA 98105.
You can also make a contribution by credit card at
www.redletterpress.org/contactnew.html

¡Mil gracias!

Thanks, Joel, for clarifications.

Sorry that I was trying to read your intent, or not simply answering
questions, and glad I did end up answering some.

One thing I left out of my listing of kinds of costs entirely is
promotional cost. For most small presses, I imagine this is not a lot, i.e.
most small presses we know do not produce an annual catalogue (but may
produce one irregularly), take out a very few ads (and many of those may be
trades of some kind), and perhaps engage once in a while in a joint
promotional venture with SPD or some other entity. That may all add up to a
promotional budget of $1000 a year or so. Yet as you go up the ladder of
presses (and I ONLY men to suggest this as a ladder in terms of the annual
budgets of presses, not in terms of value or any other sort of
measurement), the promotional budget gets bigger and bigger, with
successful commercial presses probably (and this is my guess; I haven't
verified it) spending more on promotion/marketing than on any other single
kind of expense.

I did NOT mean, as you ask below, that certain poets' books are worth more
than others. I just mean to raise the question of whether book pricing
(from all sorts of presses, taken as a whole 'industry') suggests that some
poets' books are worth more. Another question is whether "worth" here, in
monetary terms, has any correlation at all with your "use value."

I know of presses that, as you say, "charge" certain books with the
"responsibility to cover some other costs that are coded as losses in other
books," but it's not something Chax has done. The $14 to $20 range we have
used for about three or four years (a jump up from a typical price of $11
or $12 we were using throughout the 1990s) has more strictly had to do with
lower or higher production costs, often associated with odd sizes of books
(entailing higher printing costs) or significantly larger books in terms of
number of pages. The one press that years ago told me certain books had to
"cover" others, was talking about sales expectations, i.e. it was a press
that published a few novels each year, hoping for sales of 10,000 copies or
more for those books, with an income from those books that allowed for the
publication of poetry books that sold 1,000 copies or less. That was one of
the nation's largest (but not one of THE largest four or five) nonprofit
presses, with, at the time (early 1990s) a budget of about a half million
dollars per year, and a staff of about six people.

One thing that interested me about Brent Cunningham's "4x cost = reasonable
price") formula (and thanks for clarifying the limitations of that
statement), is that, when I first became involved in book work (early
1980s), I always heard (and I am sorry I don't have a source for you on
this) that a kind of publishing industry standard for such pricing was more
like "between 6x and 7x cost." The trouble with such formulas, though, is
that they tend to include books that sell 100,000 copies as well as books
that sell 1,000 copies; and pricing also has to account for books that
might expect large sales and have an initial printing of 30,000 or more,
for which sales are disappointing and half or more of those books are
shredded or remaindered.

One area of questioning I'd find of interest and use has to do with the
effect of methods of production and sizes of edition on pricing -- for
small presses, does the decision to print books via on-demand versus offset
printing, and to print 300 versus 500 versus 1000 versus 2500, effect the
pricing of individual books? If so, how much? And is the effect more or
less than the simple decision to survey the prices similar books carry, and
to price within typical market range? My guess is that, for most of us
engaged in book publishing, all of these things enter into book pricing
decisions, but not necessarily in a regularized manner. But I'd love to
hear from others on this.

charles

ps -- it may complicate all of these issues that, like you & me, many of us
engaged in small press poetry publishing are poets first, and only think of
ourselves as publishers as secondary to our writing & reading practices, so
we don't always have or take the time to think through these issues in
publishing the way we think through our engagements with literary work we
are creating, and works by others we are reading.

the Featured Readers, there is an Open Mic, and then each Featured
Reader reads an encore poem before moving to the signing table to
sign and sell their books or cds. The event is usually over by 2pm.

There is Free Parking for these events on Saturdays in the Galleria
Parking Garage: enter off Lakeside between East 9th and East 12th.
There=B4s a large sign with a 3-D curly-cue design that says "Galleria
Parking", and a ramp down under the building.

artists, but this month features the work of STORM THORGERSON, who
designed album covers for PINK FLOYD, LED ZEPPELIN, THE RASPBERRIES,

We just had a 2-day "open studio" event at Chax Press, and this morning I=20

before I simply reshelve them all, I'd offer them in a special=20

books still available from Chax (books you know about that are not on this=

books are poetry except for two works of fiction (very poetic/innovative=20

that includes poetry, prose, drawings, and interviews.

There are 48 books in all. It is as complete a run of Chax Press books (but=

The prices of these books range from $8 to $20. The total retail cost is=20

So we've placed them on ebay and set the minimum bid at $240 (plus the=20

Honoring All Soldiers By Questioning War: Local poets Tom Marshal and Rob Wilson hold a
Veterans Day reading
By Laura Mattingly

During a war in which images of returning coffins are banned from the media--and venues for
questioning the country's political actions are limited to free speech zones, The Daily Show and
the privacy of personal therapy sessions--the country once again seems in need of vocal and
impassioned poetry.

On Veterans Day at Louden Nelson Center, two socially and politically conscious Santa Cruz
poets will host a reading to commemorate the soldiers and everyone else who has been touched
in some way by the war. Poet Rev. Tom Marshal is an English instructor at Cabrillo College, and
poet Rob Wilson is a professor of literature at UCSC.

"In these poems I'm trying to address as many people as possible: anybody who might be
thinking about the war, soldiers, their moms, their relatives, the people who put them there,"
says Marshal of the works he intends to read this week. "I think we're all involved. I think one
of the things that motivates this poetry is that to some extent we're all involved and we can't
dissociate ourselves simply by being angry about what's going on."

Marshal carefully chose the wording on the flier to be as inclusive and respectful to veterans as
possible, wishing to bridge gaps between groups rather than aggravate them.

"I put on the flier that phrase, 'honoring all veterans by questioning war,' and I have heard from
a number of veterans of the recent wars that they're not being treated fairly in a number of
ways, that the war itself is something that they might rather not have had to participate in,"
says Marshal.

Marshal, in his poetry, and for this event specifically, uses the technique of "questioning" rather
than imposing judgment or offering answers.

"I think that the idea of offering some poetry that questions the war--and doesn't just yell at
Bush or seem self-righteous about it--seems like a way to serve those veterans. And as I
thought about it, I thought, well, that's kind of the same story I heard even from my dad and my
uncles and my grandfather about service that they did, that they certainly wished the politicians
would have found a way to solve things other than war."

Wilson also considers poetry and critical voice as integral to democracy, and believes that
poetry, rather than straight news, has the potential to not just transmit information but also
unsettle the listener on other experiential levels.

"I think if people hear a poem like "Howl," it turns their head around, and they say, 'Wow, we're
still there.' Whereas if you watch the news you just say, 'Ugh, well, you know, that's just the
news.' You don't have a way of breaking it through," says Wilson.

Though the audience for page poetry, or poetry in the written form, has all but disappeared in
the contemporary United States, Wilson holds the unique view that one essence of poetry as a
venue for critical questioning exists in other media forms.

"That's why even Jon Stewart, The Daily Show, is kind of like a poem, it kind of estranges the
news, makes it look kind of stupid. Or Dave Chappelle does the same thing. They're like poets
to me, they just kind of weird-it-out, they're not like CNN, which to me just sounds like the Bush
regime. It's very uncritical. ... You've got to have a critical perspective, so poetry, journalism,
writing, actually, is very important to a democracy."

Wilson's own questions center on how to respond to what he, and a growing number of people in
the United States, believe is an "unjust war." He maintains respect for the soldiers and their
experiences, while strongly disagreeing with the decisions of policymakers.

"One thing I would want to say is, my father fought in World War II, and he fought in Anzio, and
he fought in northern Africa. To me that was a just war," says Wilson. "I actually agree with the
pope, Pope John Paul II, that this was an unjust war all along, an obscenely unjust war. I
marched in the streets against it. The pope said that this [war] was going to open the doors of
hell, and that's kind of what's happened. Bush, who claims to be a Christian, just let it happen,
and the bodies are just mounting up to high heaven. I just feel it's an obscenity."

The tradition of antiwar and anti-commodification poetry in the United States caught its wind in
the 1950s with the works of now famous Beat poets and prose writers Allen Ginsberg, Jack
Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder and others. Though not restricting themselves to being
strictly Beat, both Marshal and Wilson consciously draw from this tradition and others, Marshal
having studied with Ginsberg at the Naropa Institute, as well as with W.S. Merwin, Robin Blazer
and Ron Silliman.

Much of the Beats' writing sustains its popularity, Ginsberg being arguably the most mainstream
American poet since Whitman. Wilson understands this as an indication that much of the Beats'
criticism of American mainstream culture remains relevant, perhaps even more so, today.

In the poem "Howl," Ginsberg uses the Old Testament concept of "mammonism" to describe the
postwar proliferation of materialism in the United States.

"You know, mammon's like a false idol," says Wilson, "it's the machinery of plunder. Mammon is
in 'Howl,' it's a kind of an Old Testament image of not worshipping false idols, and when you
worship golden calves or oil or something. He, Tom, is a reverend; I'm not, I'm just kind of a
small-town Catholic poet, but I want to have an exorcism. So I'm going to play Blind Willie
Johnson's 'John the Revelator,' and maybe five minutes of 'Howl,' the mammon section, because
it fits so well. He [Ginsberg] was talking about the Cold War of the 1950s and it's actually worse
now, much worse."

In line with this thinking, Marshal, in addition to his other poems, will be reading a rant-style
poem on the "possession of possessions." His intention in all of the work he'll be reading is for it
to be accessible, relevant and hopefully thought-provoking for the general public, rather than
specifically geared toward poetry aficionados.

"It's a short series of poems that interweave the sensibilities of soldiers and their mothers. To
me they're an attempt to do poetry's work of raising questions about the language that we use
and how it affects our thinking, and I have tried to write in a way that any American could get."

Marshal's respect for the counterculture poets of the 1950s, '60s and '70s is coupled with his
awareness that their impact at times fell short.

"When poetry became simply angry, simply self-righteous, I think it failed," says Marshal. "I
avoided using the word rant just now because I was afraid it might be associated with Diane
DiPrima's work, and I think of her as a person who did raise questions. There are others whose
rants were more simple and self-righteous, and that's happening again today, and I think we
could do better than that."
Meticulously aware that antiwar poetry can easily become exclusionary, Marshal hopes that
through intention this can be avoided. "I don't want to condemn anybody or blame anybody,"
says Marshal. "I just really would like to point in the direction of something more I think we
could do. If we satisfy ourselves with our anger, it has gone nowhere."
'Flag'
The flag flaps running down the
        free-way in a pick-up bed,
or lazily drapes its tall pole in the still blinding heat.
Neatly folded tri-corner, it is handed over in the end--
all the wind knocked out of it--
to one who wonders if she would or could begin again.
 --Rev. Tom Marshal
Tom Marshal and Rob Wilson will read Saturday, Nov. 11, at 7:30pm at Louden Nelson

  I thought it interesting what you said about the cost of a Print on Demand run being 1000 to $1500 for a run of 300 copies, since I'm not dealing with pod, I did not know that it was that expensive.

  Our optimal run is 1000 to 1500 copies plus overage (up to 10%) for 96 page book, a recent run of 1046 ran us a bit under 2G including shipping design and all. We still run on a 7x model with some titles as high as 12x.

  I find copyright is still crucial, not for clearing house photocopy payments, but for anthology payments and reprint rights.





Be well

Mime-Version: 1.0

If you're going to be in the Bay Area on Wednesday, November 15, I hope
you can come to a reading at USF (University of San Francisco) at 7:30
p.m.

We're going to be reading from the stories of Sam D'Allesandro, the San
Francisco-based "New Narrative" writer who died, aged 31, of AIDS in 1988.

Last year Suspect Tjoughts Press put out a new edition of D'Allesandro's
stories, called THE WILD CREATURES, and it has been a big success so far,
winning the Stonewall Award from the American Library Association.

USF is commemorating 25 years of "artistic struggle against AIDS" by a
yearlong program of readings, plays, exhibitions, lectures and panels, and
this is part of that.  I will be there, and also reading from
D'Allesandro's work will be the poets Bill Luoma and Suzanne Stein, and
the artist Colter Jacobsen.  This event is sponsored by the MFA in Writing
Program, and by the Department of Performing Arts.  And it's free to the
public (I always wonder what that expression means, and if there's some
other group, not the public, that has to shell out the entrance fee.  The
sponsors I guess).

Anyhow you may be thinking, didn't we act up, fight back, fight AIDS years
ago, and that this reading should be solemn and sad, I don't think so!  I
expect it will be the reading of the year, so don't miss it.

USF, Lone Mountain Campus (2800 Turk Street), Room 100.

Thanks, hope to see you on the 15th.

THE GRAND PIANO
An Experiment in Collective Autobiography
San Francisco, 1975-1980

by Bob Perelman, Barrett Watten, Steve Benson, Carla
Harryman, Tom Mandel, Ron Silliman, Kit Robinson,
Lyn Hejinian, Rae Armantrout, and Ted Pearson

THE GRAND PIANO is an on-going experiment in collective autobiography by
ten writers identified with Language Poetry in San Francisco. It takes its
name from a coffeehouse at 1607 Haight Street, where from 1976-79 the
authors took part in a reading and performance series. The writing project
was undertaken as an online collaboration, first via an interactive web
site and later through a listserv. When completed, THE GRAND PIANO will
comprise ten parts, in each of which the ten authors will appear in a
difference sequence.

"Like the early avant-gardes, the people who gathered at the Grand Piano
developed not only an exacting and liberating poetics, but also a way of
living-in-art. Its chronicle here is many things, among them a deeply human
and amusing map to building community through literature in this most
unlikely of times. --Cole Swensen

Published November 2006; subsequent volumes to appear at three-month
intervals. Subscription to the entire series of ten volumes is now
available for $90 (individual volumes for $12.95 each) directly from Lyn

(North Campus)

  Austin based poet and small press publisher Dale Smith edits Skanky Possum Books with Hoa Nguyen. Selections from his first book, American Rambler (Thorp Springs 2000), were selected by Robert Creeley to appear in Best American Poetry 2002. Black Stone was published this fall by Effing Press. Other books include The Flood and the Garden (First Intensity 2002) and Notes No Answer (Habenicht Press 2005). His work has also appeared in the Chicago Review, Jacket, Fascicle, First Intensity, Damn the Caesars, and elsewhere.
this event is FREE & open to the public

Dale Smith on poetry's audience  (from a July  19, 2006 blog entry):

    "My thesis is that poetry's audience is not present, but always forming. Its flux results from the unique negation of the subject by words in the act of poetic making. That is, words are not our own: they extend from a play of forces at work in the transmission of appearances at particular instances in the practice of this art."

Subject:      Does this work?
MIME-Version: 1.0

Does this work?

I'm fairly complicated in this regard; part of me feels that I'm genius
and working on necessary (however defined) themes, part of me is jealous
and troubled that others haven't really read the material (one thing that
happens a lot is that people feel a kind of hatred or awe at the work that
also keeps them from it), and part of me feels just worthless in any
situation - which has nothing to do with any of my work per se, but goes
back as usual to family issues/problems.

http://www.asondheim.org/bones.mov (with Sandy Baldwin)

There's always an issue of legitimation and history. Because my work is
produced in sections and over a wide variety of outlets, but not intensely
within any particular outlet, I feel I have to literally re-present the
grounds I work within, in any given publication. This has led to a fairly
dense writing, which is also fragmentary. I've taught in so many venues
without any kind of stability, that the fragment seems almost second
nature to me, more than the finished text which involves, again, a kind of
stability I've never had.

http://www.asondheim.org/dns.mov (with Sandy Baldwin)

As far as contents are concerned - I think what I do is valuable - at
least the work I do with analog/digital, defuge, virtual/real, the older
material on rewrite, immersive/definable, thresholding, and so forth. The
theorization of sexuality, body, and language, tends to be overdetermined
but these are grounds - abjection, the corpse, arousal, familiality - that
we live within and through, and they're often not confronted directly.
Sexuality sloughs into eroticism, body into body of theory or theoretical
body, and so forth. It's one thing to have theoretical layers between
abject and reader; it's another to have them rub raw against one another.

I felt this at the conference panel today in fact - that we're talking
about Web 3.0 on a dying planet; most people have little, if any, access
to broadband, yet the discussion appeared as if within the 'pure' of
capital, infinite capital, a fecund planet, and so forth. It's short-
sighted. For me, the death of _any_ species as a result of human behavior
is both problematic and dire - and yet we're destroying at a steady rate
of 3/4 an _hour._ It's all too easy to read WOW against that, but theory,
at least on the panel, presented the site of gaming as independent or
immune or oblivious. Again, I think that extinction/pain/slaughter and
virtual pain/slaughter inhere within each other. -

In my secret dreams, I want to produce, work on, processes etc. that are
new, that move in entirely new directions, at least for me, and at least
as far as possible. And while the work might embrace sexuality, it ab-
jures violence; there isn't murder or beatings or rapine in Incidences or
the videos - in fact there are pleasures, sadnesses, fear of death, and so
forth, but no celebration of brute force. I can't abide it; my early
reading of the Nuremberg medical trials still gives me nightmares, and I
have no faith in humans; they/we are capable of absolutely anything. So I
try to make my ecological footprint as small as possible in this regard
(which touches on vegan concerns, and so forth).

I've never seen re/presentations of humans in the manner I work with them
(yes, it's easy to mess up in Poser and produce distorted figures, but
they're not married to motion capture, they don't return to the flesh
etc.), nor have I seen dance/performance in the manner of Foofwa and co.
In the music/soundwork I try to go elsewhere than anything I hear. It's a
kind of migratory/emigrant behavior, a forced nomadicism (at least in the
roots); again I'd have to retreat to family history. (I should say I
identify with Lenny Bruce, Houdini, the Marx bros. here.)

http://www.asondheim.org/azuredanceis.mp4

I want to take theory, however I understand it, to the limit, to the limit
among other things, of its annihilation; theory is as destructive as it is
revelation - it distances the always-already distanced, to the point of
language games, no return, conferencing, capital, enunciation.

I love Lingis in this regard, and Existence and Existents as well. If one
can be made uncomfortable in a positive way, one succeeds; there's some
sort of progress (although I don't believe in progress per se). It would
be even better if one might be motivated to the point of political respon-
sibility, but I think at least in this world, that's asking too much...

So back to the beginning of this meander, I think what I'm doing is
valuable, and I have absolutely no doubt about that, none at all. How it
plays out within and without acad- emia - I have no idea, but for me (in a
safe position of course), that's not the primary thing. The primary thing
is the work - for me, it's always been the work, above anything else. I'm
well aware that this is a neurotic position but it keeps me going. -

This weekend in Berlin for those who can make it;

second annual Poetry Hearings


This year's Poetry Hearings will be the second following the success of the
2005 festival. Poetry Hearings presents English language poets, focusing on
those based in continental Europe. Cutting across poetic divisions, the
festival brings together writers working in diverse traditions: the
mainstream, the experimental, the formal, the free-ranging, performance and
prose poetry. Interesting, quality work is possible in all these forms; the
festival aims to give it a hearing.

Hi everyone,

Publisher's Weekly just had this to say about Katie Degentesh's mind-bendin=
g, climate-changing, flarftasticating book, THE ANGER SCALE:

***********************
Starred Review=E2=80=93 PublishersWeekly October 16, 2006

The Anger Scale
Katie Degentesh, Combo (SPD dist.), $12 paper (80 p) ISBN 0-9728880-2-0

Degentesh=E2=80=99s debut draws on Google by importing content from Interne=
t searches into her poems to fill in the blanks of the MMPI. That=E2=80=99s=
 psych shorthand for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, sampl=
e statements from which =E2=80=93=E2=80=9DI Feel Uneasy Indoors=E2=80=9D; =
=E2=80=9CI Am Not Afraid to Handle Money=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 serve as titles=
 for these 35 beautifully conflicted poems. Degentesh inhabits the poems=E2=
=80=99 weirdly pathologizing psychic space with a deep love of overheard sp=
eech that=E2=80=99s charged with unconscious (and sometimes not so unconsci=
ous) violence, longing and misunderstanding: =E2=80=9Cit was sloppy and blo=
ody and all fucked up,/ when I try and translate it back into English/ it s=
ounds like the Christian notion that we are born// to read stories of free,=
 unhindered UnaBirths.=E2=80=9D Degentesh is a member of the Flarflist coll=
ective, a loose gathering of Google-obsessed poets who cast their poems in =
an ironic, deliberately =E2=80=9Cnot ok=E2=80=9D mold: =E2=80=9CI loved my =
mother, and she did nothing/ as my father repeatedly beat me.=E2=80=9D The =
Weird genius of these poems is that Degentesh encodes a sliver of identific=
ation within her deadpan sendups of cliche and banality surrounding real fe=
elings, such that when one speaker says, =E2=80=9Cat the same time some poo=
r wanker necro in half undress/ was kissing, fingering and licking Shelene=
=E2=80=99s pussy,=E2=80=9D the reader feels a kind of celebration rather th=
an censure.

I am counting shipping & some of the other costs involved. Also, we're
rather unusual, quite often, about the trim sizes for our books. And when
one goes over the 6 inch width, costs go up, sometimes more than one might
think.

Wonderful review! Hope it helps bring in the sales,too.

"a loose gathering of Google-obsessed poets"

As an aside, it makes me instantly want to ask, who,or which entity is more
"obsessed" with who? That is, every sentence that anyone of us puts up on
our blogs, for example, is almost instantaneously searchable by Google -
without query or request for permission to reveal - right down to the
satellite map visual revelations of our very houses.

If to flarf, in part, is to counter-surveil and rework Google's blanket web
oversight into whatever maybe one's poetic or others terms, I can see the
seduction. =20

Obviously, the skill - to make a 'real' poem or not - is in the hands of th=
e
players. Whoops - good, bad or indifferent - here comes Google to take the
poems right back, endlessly re-consuming everything, no matter the
counter-attack des poets. (Isn't ironic to hear Google tell publishers that
- if they have copyright concerns - you should contact  their offices to
correct the situation. Shoot first, apologize later.

Oh well, who ever said language of any sort was not public property, i.e.,
nobody owns it, except those Corps with those brands, and branding devices,
and lawyers to bring in the outlaw kill! Will the MPPI folks be after Katie
now? Or after Google?

Hmmm,

david, we're in the early phases of planning a version of this, so it's
exciting to read your description. one thing i'd like to see is a co-op
model where teacher-members add content and modules and this becomes
part of the share-ware-house of available stuff. open-source
textbooking but with more and friendlier output options than you get,
say, with Wikibook. this is quite possible in teaching writing, for
example, where a lot of the wisdom is stolen anyway by the textbook
mafia and simply needs to be laundered for re/distribution. Calculating
fees for printing might actually be the easier part, once there's a
page count. copyright might slow things but that's doable too, and as
an editorial intervention (part of our plan) if not a program-driven
thing. interim option would be to avoid protected content altogether
and work off public-domain material, tho that's a different ball of
witz.

cheers,
bill

David,

More to say on all of this, but on the cost of POD, that much depends
on page length, size of book, cover quality, etc.. I just did a pretty
standard 5x8 book at maybe 90pp, 3-color covs, good paper, and it was
about $350 for 150, and cost/book comes down with larger initial runs.
Obviously it could cost over a grand for 300 if it's a big book, but it
really does vary.

Be well,
bill

Recent book from Junction Press, POD first run of 300, 5 1/2 x 8 1/2,
106 pages, 4 color 12 pt gloss lam cover, 60 lb paper--$620. At up to
1200 copies there's no saving on offset, given storage costs. Unless,
of course, one thinks to sell the entire run very quickly.

has been updated with 12 pieces by Mirela Roznoveanu.

There is a territory where mathematics overlaps linguistic
meaning-making. It is not uncharted; come see.

I read about all these wonderful poetry readings in Chicago, New York,  San Francisco. You are all so lucky to live in cities that support  poetry. I tried to get poetry readings going in my small city of  65,000, and it simply did not generate interest. I can't move to San  Francisco, New York, etc. I am just expressing my support, enthusiasm,  and yes, a kind envy at what happens where national/international  culture exists.

  Best,
  Mary

(1. poetics and dance. 2. poetics in 2nd life. flarf-free.)



SAC and Pillars and Dance


1. Pillars and Dance


CountryDance was videotaped on a bluff overlooking Lac Leman in the Roman city
of Nyon, outside of Geneve. Maud Liardon performs a folk or country dance
which, I believe, is Swedish in origin; Foofwa d'Imobilite performs a separated
but inseparable work, separated by the framing device of a pillar. (The scene
is a remnant of a ruin, agora or forum transported to its present location
above the void.) If Maud's dance resonates with the names of towns encountered
on our journey, Foofwa's speeds and slows, measured against them. It is the
regulatory apparatus of Roman architec- ture and military organization against
the peasantry, with its excessive retemporalization of the real. Jakarta and
shadow puppetry come to mind as d'Imobilite's presentation appears flattened in
its silhouette; the pirou- etting of Liardon transforms the female body into
volume - a volumetric whose forensics reveal the architecture of fecundity. Her
turns create a tensor calculus destined to overturn the fabric of Roman
linearity.

Beyond this evident symbolics, there are issues of nationalism, Swiss
nationalism and its symbolic - Switzerland, with its 100,000 year-old past,
ranging from deep prehistory through the wild tribal groups surrounding
Hannibal's pilgrimage through the Alps. One has the Alphorn, citharas of all
sorts, yodels and cheese, skies and private banking; one has costuming and
multiple languages and dialects, Swatch and army knife, Rolex and fondue. The
symbols proliferate to the extent that the imaginary of the Alps occupies a
territory almost as large as the United States; in reality, Switzerland is
roughly the size of West Virginia. Given this, any sign of "authenticity" may
be seized by the visitor as Switzerland's Beyond, in the heart of the country
and its culture. The fractal Alps twist and turn all the way down; dancing
might present the preposterous notion of a "Swiss soul" (or any other nation's
"soul") as the flesh supports Foofwa's "authentic" (the quotes proliferate)
Gruyere costume.

Nevertheless the emblematic espoused by d'Imobilite's dance is a furious series
of signs, almost toppling against the steadied rhythm of Maud's performance.
Consider this: an alphabet of dance transformed through the graphemic directly
into inscription, which is sublimated into the usual form and figuration of
text. To the extent that dance leaves one speech-
less, dance speaks; isn't this true of any cultural form? And if it is so, if
it is true, than cultural form subsumes speech, creates a differend out of
which speech emerges only in its problematic. Here, speech is simultan- eously
performative and non-performative - and what is the performative of speech in
the first place? Nothing whatsoever without cultural context, mores, etiquette,
and power down the road. This isn't the performative of a computer program in
which for example "date" produces "October 4" - it's not process but
flattening, re/presentation. Dance gives the lie, in other words, to the
performative of language, just as violence gives the lie to dance. It is both
degree and epistemological shift; ontology is just around the corner.

This conundrum, this relative annihilation of language, fascinates dance,
fastens dance. Language is ultimately residue; inscription is hardened
language, the beginnings of power, the suturing of the body politic. It takes
dance, and dance signifying class, to unite language through its bypassing.
Revolution is in the step, and violence is not far behind. One way or another,
the earth stumbles beneath the feet of the dancers; one way or another,
everything and nothing survives.

excerpt from Darcie Dennigan's "Sentimenal Atom Smasher"
in COMBATIVES #2


           What's the matter? says the bartender. And the guy says,

I'm confused. Am I allowed to be homesick in a joke?
           Yes, the bartender says. It's elemental, the bartender says-

           how streets are downtrodden atoms and falling leaves are
aflutter atoms and beer is over-the-moon atoms and the moon's an
atomizer

of all matter's perfumes: And the guy starts to parse it out-
           wait, I'm not smart, but if emotion's a material substance

           then when a leaf falls in my lap and I hold it like an
about-to-be- abandoned baby, I'm touching "aflutter" in 3-D?

           Dear fluttering leaf!
Streets-I'm sorry for stepping on you! Apples-for coring you, and beer-

** The EMERGENCY poetry series is made possible in part by the Kerry
Sherin Wright Prize **

(Learn more! --> http://emergency-reading.blogspot.com/)

What does it mean to be an emerging poet in America today? Does Dana
Gioia's claim that "poetry has vanished as a cultural force in America"
ring true for poets at the cutting edge of literary production? Does
today's emerging poet face increasing isolation and shrinking audiences,
or is a quiet renaissance taking place, one centered around close-knit
communities, long-distance mentorships, new media, and chapbook exchange?
How are theoretical stances and aesthetic practices transmitted among
poets at different stages in their careers?

The Emergency Series at Kelly Writers House seeks to answer these
questions, highlighting perspectives on the current state of American
poetry through the diverse experiences of its practicing poets. By
bringing together emerging and established poets for readings and
discussions, it aims to create an ongoing dialogue about the role poetic
lineage plays in a poet's development, and its impact on the vitality of
the craft.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOAH ELI GORDON will have two books appear in 2007: "Novel Pictorial
Noise" (selected by John Ashbery for the 2006 National Poetry Series) and
"A Fiddle Pulled From the Throat of a Sparrow" (New Issues, winner of the
Green Rose Prize). He is the author of the book-length poem "The
Frequencies" (Tougher Disguises, 2003), a collection of three long poems
"The Area of Sound Called the Subtone" (Ahsahta Press, 2004, selected by
Claudia Rankine for the Sawtooth Prize), "an e-book notes toward the
spectacle" (Duration Press) and chapbooks from Margin to Margin, Anchorite
Press, and Anon Books. Ugly Duckling Presse recently published "That We
Come To A Consensus", a chapbook written in collaboration with Sara
Veglahn. His reviews have appeared in dozens of journals, including Boston
Review, The Poker, 26, Jacket, and The St. Marks Poetry Project
Newsletter. He writes a new chapbook review column for Rain Taxi, teaches
creative writing at the University of Colorado at Denver, and has an essay
slated to appear in Burning Interiors: "On the Poetry of David Shapiro"
(Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, forthcoming).

JASON ZUZGA is currently a PhD student in English at the University of
Pennsylvania. He is the nonfiction editor of FENCE magazine, and his
poetry and nonfiction have appeared in such journals as The Yale Review,
jubilat, Tin House, Seneca Review and VOLT. He was the 2005-2006 James
Merrill Poet-in-Residence in Stonington, CT and a 2001-2002 Provincetown
Fine Arts Work Center Writing Fellow. He received his MFA in poetry and
nonfiction from the Univerity of Arizona.

KATE GREENSTREET'S first book, "case sensitive", is just out from Ahsahta
Press. Her chapbook, "Learning the Language" was published by Etherdome
Press last fall. Born in Chicago, Kate has lived mostly on the east and
west coasts of the U.S., currently back on the Atlantic side, in New
Jersey. She received a Fellowship from the NJ State Council on the Arts in
2003. Her poems have appeared in Bird Dog, Conduit, can we have our ball
back?, GutCult, Diagram, Octopus, POOL, The Massachusetts Review, No Tell
Motel, Fascicle, Barrow Street, Kulture Vulture, and other journals. She

i like these. they raise interesting questions without proposing any
simplistic answers. and they are intelligent and humorous. i particularly
liked the climax series. pseudo graphs concerning the pleasures of art and
poetry and, in particular, the roles of technology and possibly anti-art and
anti-technology, anti-poetry, anti-all the previous toward the climax.

the graphs plot something other than quantitative data. they scheme,
perhaps, rather than simply plot.

they scheme the overthrow of simple quantitivity, perhaps. they scheme and
plot pleasure and art.

from such a distance the achievements of the parents may indeed seem
pathetic. that view will be revised later on when the children ruefully
consider whether they themselves were their parent's main love in the world
for the sake of which much else fell to ruin.

Daniel,

To explore the relationship between the photographic image and words you
should read my book "The Peripheral Space of Photography" (Green Integer,
2003).

Ciao,

Dear All-



I'm writing an article for a major newspaper that discusses the five best
poetry books published in 2006. I have a list in mind, but assuming there's
something I've missed, I'd be happy for nominations.  Send me an email
listing, 1-5, the authors and titles you think I should include.

    Do include Kate Greenstreet's case sensitive from Ahsahta Press and
Martha Collins's Blue Front from Graywolf. Both are magnificent books.

Thank you, Renee.  I enjoyed Blue Front and will look into case sensitive.



By the way, if anyone else would like to respond, please direct your
response to aaron@belz.net and NOT to the public forum.

Reminder of approaching deadline: November 30, 2006

CALL FOR PAPERS
SHARP 2007 Conference: Open the Book, Open the Mind

* Plenary speakers will include Adrian Johns and Louise Erdrich.
* There will also be a plenary panel discussion of "Book Arts and
Artist's Books" (see below for details).

The fifteenth annual conference of the Society for the History of
Authorship, Reading, and Publishing (SHARP) will be held in Minneapolis
at the University of Minnesota on July 11-15, 2007. SHARP is the leading
international association for historians of print culture, enlisting
more than 1,200 scholars world-wide; its members study "the creation,
dissemination, and reception of script and print, including newspapers,
periodicals, and ephemera," as well as the history of books. The
forthcoming conference is organized in cooperation with the College of
Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota; University of Minnesota
Libraries; Minneapolis Public Library; Minnesota Historical Society, and
Minnesota Center for Book Arts -- a part of Open Book.

The conference theme, "Open the Book, Open the Mind," will highlight how
books develop and extend minds and cultures, and also how they are
opened to new media and new purposes. However, individual papers or
sessions may address any aspect of book history and print or manuscript
culture.

The conference organizers invite proposals for individual presentations,
and also for complete panels of three presentations on a unifying topic.
As is the SHARP custom, each session of 90 minutes will feature three
papers of up to 20 minutes, providing time for substantive discussion
with members of the audience. Proposals should be submitted via the
online conference website by November 30, 2006: please go to
http://purl.oclc.org/NET/SHARP2007proposals and follow the directions
provided there.

Each individual proposal should contain a title, an abstract of no more
than 300 words, and brief biographical information about the author or
co-authors. Session proposals should explain the theme and goals, as
well as include the three individual abstracts.

In keeping with the theme of the conference, a "pre-conference" of
practical workshops and a special plenary panel will be held at the
Minnesota Center for Book Arts at Open Book, near the University of
Minnesota campus, on Tuesday, July 10, 2007. The plenary panel
discussion, "Book Arts and Artist's Books," will include:

    * Harriet Bart, book artist
    * Betty Bright, independent scholar and curator (chair)
    * Gaylord Schanilec, wood engraver and fine printer
    * Ruth Rogers, special collections librarian, Wellesley College Library
    * Kathleen Walkup, professor and head, Book Arts Program, Mills College

Details about the pre-conference, the main conference program,
registration, and housing arrangements will be made available early in
2007 at the general conference web site,
http://www.cce.umn.edu/conferences/sharp. Much information about SHARP
2007 and its location, including hotel-reservation information, is
already available there.

Dead


I woke up this morning covered in blood. I fell down the stairs and a sharp
shard of bone cut into my abdomen. A severe stroke has incapacitated my right
side. Alzheimer's lesions have almost literally cauterized my memory; I hardly
recognize Azure. The odd pulsing in my abdomen stems from a hard lump which
appears to be growing. When I try to stand my legs collapse under me. My stools
are bloody. I've been so dizzy I can hardly walk across the room. I'm
constantly sweating under the bed-clothes. I tried to call Azure but could
hardly speak. I fell on the floor and lost consciousness and died. The whole
bathroom is covered with blood. There are spots in front of my eyes everywhere.
I can't see anymore. Help me up. My arms are tingling. My brain is swelling;
the pain is horrible. My heart is beating so fast it's bursting. I can't
breath. I'm gasping for breath. I'm about to go unconscious. I'm too dizzy to
stand up. My heart's stopped beating. It's permanent. I'm dead. There's an
unbelievable pain in my lower abdomen. My stomach's in knots. I'm falling over.
I'm crawling to the door. I die before I reach the door. There's a white light
but the light fades. The pain is too great. I can't think about anything. I
call Azure's name. I think I called it. I can't remember about anything. I
can't stand up. I can't be here. My chest is torn in two. I can't see anything.
My ears filled with screams. The screams may be mine. I don't want to die. I
really don't want to die. The right side of my body is gone. I'm bleeding from
my mouth. I can't move. I'm dead.

Hi Alan -

Is there a You Tube version of this?
Or in the works? (!!!!)

This strikes me as poignant---but I hope I'm not just being "duped"
and that this is really one of your "code" pieces (or poems?)....
(you've always been so coy about the difference between the
two....which makes it hard to trust...for me)

But that's okay...thanks for posting it...

Chris, I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you suggest that you
would be "duped" if you liked this poem and then found out it was a code
piece.  What would the problem be, exactly?  Where does trust come into it?

I ask because I'm surprised you would consider poignancy and procedurality
(if that's a word) mutually exclusive categories--unless I misunderstand you
and that's not your point at all.

Anyway, Alan, I thought this piece was really great.  I originally typed up
a jokey little response to it saying something like, "I don't want to alarm
you, but those symptoms sound like they could be masking something
serious--maybe you should see a doctor," but discarded it because I didn't
want to create the impression that I was being dismissive of a poem that I
actually find truly moving.

somebody please tell me what a code piece is -- I don't understand this
hip jargon you kids like to swing around like a Ukrainian sausage during
Lent.

how the hell am I expected to understand / decide I will never
understand this kind of stuff if a glossary of essential terms is not
supplied?=20

There is a 'dead pan' quality/character about the piece - whether it's a
sincere exploration of one's own disintegration by some kind of terrible
inside/outside outside affliction (and what that might imply or provide as
an experience in emotional desperation) or whether this is a baroque send-
up, a staring down, and creating a momentary victory over the fates (one's
mortality) by imagining the worst - thereby gaining some kind of reprieve.

The piece is so over-the-top, I was left with Chris S's ambivalence. Where
do we honor or limit our honor of extremes? It makes me remember Chris
Burden purposely taking a shot in the arm circa 1974 and the documentation
of that event as both art and anti-art object. (Can we actually put this in
a Gallery?) In the sense that Alan here may be wanting to shake prescribed
aesthetic kindness' off the way academia and, even, me too, are oft prone to
remove the frame of the poem from its actual occasion - attending, for
example, to the paragraph structures in Proust and entirely missing or
forgetting what's literally going on in the heart of the work..

Alan, as always or frequently, le provocateur, raising these questions.

Dears,

Please join us for two more events before the lovely break we are graced
with next week, and then come back post-holiday for two more! In
anticipation of our tiny rest ahead, let us now serenade you...

Oh to be an angel (if there were any!), and go
straight up into the sky and look around and then
                                                              come down

not to be covered with steel and aluminum
glaringly ugly in the pure distances and clattering and
                                            buckling, wheezing

but to be part of the treetops and the blueness, invisible,
the iridescent darkness beyond,
                                                    silent, listening to
                the air becoming no air becoming air again

Intimate Relationships With Impersonal Structures: Jill Magid

Jill Magid is a visual artist who explores the device of seduction as a
means of engaging impersonal, governing systems in an intimate way in order
to expose vulnerabilities and permeable points of entrance into structures
such as the NYC MTA police, the Dutch Secret Service or British CCTV
surveillance mechanisms. She will be presenting images and reading text fro=
m
a current project in which she approached an MTA police officer underground
and asked him to search her. He wouldn't search her but he agreed to train
her. Months of clandestine underground meetings ensued, as Magid instigated=
,
pushed and maintained a personal dialogue within the surveilling power
structure. She will discuss related works as well.
After receiving a Masters of Science in Visual Studies from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2000, Magid relocated to the
Netherlands as a resident at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten and ha=
s
since been showing internationally. Her work has been shown at a solo
exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam, at De Appel in
Amsterdam, Balance and Power curated by Michael Rush at the Krannert Art
Museum in Illinois, Positioning statement | Image Cairo 3 in Cairo, Egypt,
DMZ 2005 Korea: A project between North and South Korea, and at the
Liverpool Biennial International ,2004. Upcoming shows include Naked Life a=
t
MOCA Taipei and CASM Barcelona. She is a visiting artist at Cooper Union an=
d
a lecturer at University of Pennsylvania. Magid currently lives and works i=
n
New York and Amsterdam.www.jillmagid.net

"a code piece" is a poem that is not whole of itself, but rather
something that is fraught with concern or "love-antipathy" & its irony
not reconciled.

it appears to be geekspeak for computer generated text -- in other
words, it resides on an axis defined (to my mind) by flarf,
google-sculpting and the descended masters spawned from Jackson MacLow's
algorithm poetry (presumably in some kind of black magic ritual in the
early 70s).

While no other form of net art and net poetry is structurally as closely
linked to computing as programming code poetry, more recent net art and
net poetry takes an aesthetic step beyond the former in modelling its
language after programming and protocol code without strictly
reproducing its logic. The code poetry of, among others, mez, Alan
Sondheim and Ted Warnell seems to build on two developments:=20

a) the re-coding of traditional pictorial ASCII art into amimetical
noise signals by net artists like Jodi, antiorp, mi-ga and Frederic
Madre, =20

b) the mass-proliferation of programming language syntax through web and
multimedia scripting languages and search engines. For the reader of
mez's "netwurks", it remains all the more an open question whether the
"mezangelle" para-code of parentheses and wildcard characters only
mimicks programming languages or is, at least partially, the product of
programmed text filtering.

I mean in the figurative, pejorative sense, that "coded" writing is
"imperfect" due to encroachment on the text of the writer's own
personality, when his "intentions" are distancing of such, where
"love-antipathy" comes into regards.  Of course in the literal sense of
it having been developed with AI tools, the usage still hems to the
figurative sense, at least for now.

I think that in their strange jargon, a code piece is what we used to
call
a codpiece. It is used for about the same purpose.

God forbid, a poem involves genuine emotion. Perhaps, Alan's piece is based
on panic.

You know, The Stendhal Syndrome, an excess of beauty leads to panic, and the
person disappears into the work in a frightening loss of identity. In Alan's
case this excess is the internet.

Ciao,

Murat

This is true; on one hand the defuge of distribution systems, their
decathecting, internments; on the other, corrosive flesh and its resonant
nightmares. The net is always already excessive.

Re: Code poetry btw - at least as I know it - what I'm working with is
somewhat different, codework; in any case, the text wasn't generated, nor
is there any relation to flarf or google/X/scraping that I can think of.
I'm more interested in the politics of body/sex/language, the drive
towards extinction, the problematic of transgression.

I'm having trouble figuring out why you appeared on that "news"
program in the first place. I hope Scheer has thanked O'Reilly for the
publicity.

I have lived outside the US for ten years now, and in that time I have
watched the people become obsessed with and polarized by politics,
with no concern for statesmanship or effective government for the
people. I have also witnessed my friends in the states, mostly
left-wingers, become "experts" in politics, taking the New York Times
as gospel and using these so-called facts of the press as weapons for
personal attacks on those whose opinions differ. Never in my lifetime
has the US government served the interests of the people. My
sympathies to those who live in such an environment. Peace to you
brothers and sisters.

the youth in Asia
are sweating
like Coke cans
while Amerika
filibusters freedom

and old Europe

from their ruins

deforms alliances

north and west
Amerika loves
Amerika best

anything they pass

i am, as my mentor diane tells me, a traditionalist.  i tend toward elitist.

i don't think, or believe, that poems don't deal with geniune human emotion,
or panic brought by the excess of beauty, etc.  i think the best poems deal
with just that (i'm thinking of spicer's "15 false propositions against
god", o'hara's "meditations in an emergency", schuyler's "this dark
apartment" or "korean mums").

i applaud all poets working to include different genres, or expand poetry.
but i think at its heart, poetry has been, and continues to NEED to be, the
way we order and make sense of what we see: beauty, the supremely horrible,
etc.

why can't we hold alan's work to that same standard?  i think his poem is a
solid start, but i don't think that just because he (or we) have labeled it
as a "code piece" that that makes it above our ability to critique, revise,
etc.  i do have a real problem with the increasingly prevalent notion that
"you can't suggest changes to my work, it is perfect as i wrote it because i
wrote it".  this is not meant as a critique of this thread, or alan's
piece--that's a lingering poetic pet peeve of mine.

what i find to be strongest about alan's piece is its insistence that was is
happening in the poem is real--even tho logic tells us it can't be.  but
with all good poems, or promising early drafts of good poems, good writing
and solid exposition (and trope) override our logic.

alan, i'd love to hear an audio version of your poem.  it is almost
kafka/camus-esque.  i'd also like to see the next draft.

thanks for listening,

angela

McGuane, Hersman, Rader, and Rankins read at Gallery 324 November 18
at noon.

Gallery 324 presents a weekly literary reading and performance
series: Every Saturday at Noon. The reading begins at noon. The
Featured Readers each read from the work of another writer whom they
admire, then read their own work for about 15 minutes. Following all
the Featured Readers, there is an Open Mic, and then each Featured
Reader reads an encore poem before moving to the signing table to
sign and sell their books or cds. The event is usually over by 2pm.

There is Free Parking for these events on Saturdays in the Galleria
Parking Garage: enter off Lakeside between East 9th and East 12th.
There=B4s a large sign with a 3-D curly-cue design that says "Galleria
Parking", and a ramp down under the building.

Founded in 2005, Gallery 324 mainly showcases the work of Ohio
artists, but this month features the work of STORM THORGERSON, who
designed album covers for PINK FLOYD, LED ZEPPELIN, THE RASPBERRIES,
MUSE, 10CC, and many others. Located in the Galleria at Erieview on
the first floor near the Food Court, Gallery 324 is operated by
Marcus Bales, a Cleveland glass artist, in conjunction with Gary
Roberts, a Cleveland furniture designer.

square gazebos, taverns, and churches.  He has published occasionally
in the small press and is an assistant editor with Pudding House

Sherlockian events in the U.S. and Canada, and visited Sherlockian,
Arthurian, and children's literature locations in England and the

>University of Minnesota Postdoctoral Fellowship Program
>
>Application Deadline: December 1, 2006
>Fellowship Description
>
>Purpose
>Recognizing that diverse communities foster thriving learning and working
>environments, the University of Minnesota is committed to advancing the
>intellectual agenda and enhancing the cultural diversity of the University
>community.  The University of Minnesota Postdoctoral Fellowship is a
>university-wide initiative to attract promising scholars with potential to
>pursue future faculty positions at the University of Minnesota and at other
>top research universities.  We are particularly interested in appointing
>postdoctoral fellows whose teaching and research agendas are closely aligned
>with the University's areas of strength and strategic initiatives in fields
>where we anticipate future faculty growth. We invite applications from
>scholars whose research and scholarly interests reflect one or a combination
>of the following priorities: (1) scholarship that contributes to the
>understanding of diversity in its multiple forms; (2) strong interest in
>interdisciplinary research and scholarship or creative work; and (3)
>engagement in partnerships with communities outside of the academy.
>
>Fellows will have a unique opportunity to work directly with the
>University's most prominent faculty, including our Regents and Distinguished
>McKnight Professors.  Recognized for exceptional research and teaching,
>University of Minnesota senior faculty will mentor postdoctoral fellows to
>establish an independent research agenda and become acclimated to the
>institutional culture.  The purpose of the mentoring relationship is to
>nurture the fellows' intellectual development and professional growth to
>ensure future success in tenure-track academic positions.
>
>Supporting Future Faculty
>In addition to the mentoring relationship, fellows will benefit from
>participating in a series of seminars focused on securing grants, building a
>successful publication record, developing effective networking skills,
>fostering multiculturalism in higher education, and sustaining best research
>and teaching practices. To build intellectual community, fellows and other
>members of the University will participate in formal and informal events
>scheduled throughout the year, including the President's fall welcome
>reception and the spring interdisciplinary research symposium, where fellows
>showcase their work to the University community.  Fellows will also join the
>University's Postdoctoral Association, an organization that identifies and
>addresses issues pertinent to the postdoctoral experience.   The mentoring
>relationship, professional development seminars and intellectual community
>are intended to prepare fellows for tenure-track faculty positions.
>
>Prospect for Dual Appointments
>The University of Minnesota offers an enormous breadth of academic
>disciplines through leading departments, strong interdisciplinary programs,
>and thriving research institutes and centers.  Fellows will have the
>advantage of affiliating with one or more units across the University where
>a strong match can be established between the fellows' research interests
>and those of the academic units.  Dual appointments are possible for fellows
>demonstrating productive interdisciplinary research and teaching interests.
>In addition to conducting research, fellows will teach at least one course
>per year.
>
>Terms of the Fellowship
>For the 2007-2008 academic year, up to three fellowships will be awarded for
>a minimum duration of one year beginning in September 2007.  Appointments
>are full-time (40 hours per week).  Awards may be renewable for a second
>year based on an assessment of progress.  The minimum in-residence
>requirement is 9 months each year.  Although stipend amounts will vary by
>discipline, fellows will receive a minimum annual stipend of $40,000.
>Funding for research and travel to professional conferences will be provided
>in collaboration with the sponsoring academic department or unit. The
>University also offers subsidized medical and dental insurance coverage.
>Fellows will be responsible for relocation expenses.

>preferred from individuals who received their terminal degrees or
>postdoctoral training from institutions other than the University of
>Minnesota.

Andrew: or ten years now, and in that time I have watched
the people become obsessed with and polarized by politics,
with no concern for statesmanship or effective government
for the people. I have also witnessed my friends in the
states, mostly left-wingers, become "experts" in politics,
taking the New York Times as gospel and using these
so-called facts of the press as weapons for personal attacks
on those whose opinions differ.



"Politics is the systematic organization of hatreds." -Henry
Adams


It's interesting how people's expressions of ideology are
often opposite or paradoxical with regard to their own
lives. For example, I've known lots of people who love
"humanity" but absolutely hate individual people and are
rude and nasty in the concrete while professing universal
love in the abstract. Similarly, some of the most
avant-garde innovators in the arts have maintained the most
conservative and conventional appearance (young John Cage in
his business suits for example).

Think of Einstein, with his socialist universalism, who
abandoned his wife and child. Or better, think of Rousseau,
he of the noble savage concept, who had five children by his
mistress and abandoned her (to poverty) and them (to the
orphanage). Or if you want a poetic example, think of Rilke,
whose need for spiritual solitude led him to abandon his
wife so that they lived apart for most of their lives.

the blank page looks an awful lot like an empty snow drift --=20

if you're a writer, poet, artist, critic, creative soul, living in the
Upper Midwest (defined arbitrarily by me as Minnesota, the Dakotas, Iowa
and Wisconsin), then I'm interested in hosting your work on my new blog,
Minnesotan Ice (http://minnesotan-ice.blogspot.com/).=20

the intention is to capture writing originated in the Upper Midwest, in
part to form or define or elaborate on the community in these parts.

theme is up to you. some day, I expect to cull from the entries and
produce a journal you can hold in your own hands.

submissions can be previously published material, if copyright
permits... new material is always appreciated. experimental is good.

if interested, check out the site, or contact me at thewordman@mac.com /

I like what you've done, Dan, with your piece "five by five". It's the most
remarkable love poem I've seen in a long time. You've used the
three-dimensionality to move through emotional experience in an extrordinary
way.

Great to hear David Knoebel again!

I think the problem here is that, what one person senses as a need,
another doesn't. For me poetry has "needs" to have an intensity or
urgency - but I wouldn't want to generalize this to others. Instead
it translates as "this is what I'm interested in, this is what moves
me" - which is something else again.

Well, I'm not sure what a "solid start" means. The work is finished. What
I am sure about - is that if one looks at code poetry, coded or encoded
writing, codework, e-poetry, etc., critique should, if it is to respond at
least in part to the form and structure of the work, take into account the
means of production, distribution, protocols, and codings - and take this
into account in depth. Otherwise, it's only surface. Obviously people work
through code etc. for a reason; it's not an appendage to a work, but often
integral to it.

Here for example is part of a codework dealing with anguish, and the way
anguish interferes with, cauterizes language. So what happens is that a
"General Protection Fault" crashes the machine - a contradictory phrase
since faults don't protect, etc.

A moment when I think I might just be able to transform anguish into
philosophy. Of course that isn't true; one stays against the stays
of the other, as if moving solo across phenomenological waters. I
can't work this way. Is  make -k C:\dor.el

- Letters (forming words) are inserted among "ha ha" - laughter, and "wah
wah" - sadness; the video referred to is Maud and Foofwa making high-speed
faces in a restaurant, moving rapidly from the presentation of one emotion
to another.

In another also connected to a video, the Internet Text is scraped (some-
thing I've been working with for over a decade) to construct a text deal-
ing with emotional avatars:

pain. avatar.

in pain. if she moves they knew i played with avatars, avatar-abuse: this
avatar dancers - and we can map into entirely new spaces and content - the
occupation of virtual space - parent-child relations, father-avatar avatar
< digital < broken > analog < mocap < digital > avatar-meats are leashed,
tethered to logical reach of avatars. reach avatars. of and my people! my
avatars! my little maud-enunciation of avatars, pre-duet: making new
avatars on - my, the swords make the avatar angry! azure writhes house.
they knew i played with avatars, front of the house. that they avatars.
that one cannot cum seems to lack coherency. i wish i was home. avatar-
abuse: this is more than familiar to me. i am in the neighborhood manner,
similar to the avatar but the dancer is dancer imitated by a month old,
protocol-driven, hunger for signifiers, azure struggles which is more
than familiar, is more than familiar: they knew i played with avatars.
avatar-abuse: this relates to mother-father relations: primordial thought
of "my avatars avatars." so this is what it looks like from inside - an
avatar. those few knew i played with avatars; all of them are avatars,
but mapped - which in fact indicates the direct murmuring of avatar-meat;
you can hear them directly beneath the swords. avatars have to avoid
swords, their baggage. they speak through a thousand dancers, most of whom
were abused.

The following was scraped using the Google API and a perl script; the
result was then modified:

- The idea was to create a visual cliff, strata representing the density
of pulling meaning out of rock, the 19th century science of (more or less)
visual stratigraphy.

In the following, a script in Second life was turned into Beckett:

watery

bugsy molloy - sup you - i have fleas bugsy molloy - nice you - not really
you - you think i'm typing i'm scratching like crazy bugsy molloy - lol
you - that's easy for you to say you - try it with pesky varmints jumping
all over you,darn! bugsy molloy - ill pass you - not really, i caught some
virus my hard drive's messed up and my memory's rammed flat bugsy molloy -
that sucks you - not as bad as microsoft you - lsmft lucky strike means
fine tobacco bugsy molloy - ohh ya bugsy molloy - how long you been
playin?? you - about a year or two now you - but i don't know anything and
the fleas are in the way, maybe try some calomine lotion i don't know
etc.

That text was changed to some degree; the dashes are from Sterne. In the
following two religion lists at a hacking site were combined and reordered
to accompany a video; think of these as chant:

god

daedalus daedelus daemon danaan daoine daoinesidhe daoram deino
etc.

Finally, the following was created using an old perl script I wrote
(literally years ago) that reorders and catalyzes text input; I wrote, in
other words, into the program, which just rearranged sections. But the
surrounding quotations (in the program) send or inspire the text in other
directions:

octopus chased by train

http://www.asondheim.org/octopuschasedbytrain.mp4

inside, we huddle within ourselves, medieval grange warming us for the
next chain or bluff or cliff, the abandoned resort in the midst of
whistling winds, emptied church of all but brilliant sound, fingers
gracing keys; now the little party has moved out of doors, what delight {
} immersion now ascending now descending such thinned air { }:lost-body-
skins slough from miracles of movement, inflationary moments of universal
depth, O Maud! O Foofwa! Thou conquerest thine ridges of hunger taut
against meadow and moraine! civilization floods from thine arms and legs,
hands and feet, neck and torso, waist and hair. Weirdness of furies tamed
by grange and goat, Alpine chough and sparrow, fawn and fog, the weather
darkling towards the welkin's eve, enormous face of the world
inconceivably thrusting towards the stars { }:smeared and teetering across
the landscape of exaltation, glacial exhalation as the enormous lip
etc.

- The point of all of this is that there are numerous methods to work with
or interfere with "writing" - I use the term "wryting" to reference those
methods which problematize both normal (normative) text and encoding -
system, structure, and semantics simultaneously collapse. The result can
be a "mess" - just like like is a mess in which rules and roles play a
large part - but the mess is entangled like the real; it goes somewhere
else and quite possibly somewhere new.

transgression of the 1st and 2nd life

the chiasm turns back on itself.
I knew something was wrong with the world.
at the edge, the pli or fold - analog transforms into zero.
zero-multiplication: the world is absorbed.
one-multiplication: the world returns to the world.
we do not return.
we head across the divide.
we are returned.
again and again, we are returned.
we form a corpuscle.

if zero is boundary, one is interior.
the boundary has zero area in relation to interior.
but the same order of the continuum.

you can assign addresses one place or another.
these addresses are on the boundary.
the interior is emptied.
the interior is empty.

responsibility, Amato's is a necessary voice in performative
engagement with the labor-intensive underside of academic work. His
command of vernacular locutions ranges from impressive to dizzying.
Allied to such discerning critical intelligence, such proficiency has
the potential to alter -- and certainly refresh -- the nature of
scholarly discourse."

"1. Buy it.
2. Listen up.
3. Deprofessionalize.
4. Buy a copy for a friend.
5. Write a book like this.
6. Industrial Poetics is da bomb.
7. Because the taste is what counts."
	Charles Bernstein

"The second 'Track' (chapter) of this wild, hilarious, learned,
irreverent, energetic, nasty, and touching book is called 'How a
Former Professional Engineer Becomes a Former English Professor.' And
that's what Industrial Poetics is all about: working-class aspirants
for middle-class 'professional' goodies, academic and journalistic
hypocrisies, community failures, and the general all-around mayhem we
experience at the turn of the twenty-first century. A collage of
techniques from anaphoric verse to slangy dialogue, from pop song to
scholarly reference, Industrial Poetics will make you laugh and
sometimes cry with exasperation. Can life on the assembly line and in
the ivory tower really be this absurd? Answer, oh yes, and then
some."

I saw this, and while it is a little off topic to the original question --
five best books of 2006 -- what makes a book, espeically of poetry, a "book
of the year" -- is it especially good?  in a year, it hasn't had a chance to
really reach its audience yet, yet, if it came out in Januaary, it might
already be gone from chain bookstores, and if it is not yet out, it is not
going to make "end of the year -- think about buying these for gifts" books
stories --

I recently bought the world book year book for 1967 at the library used book
sale, and of course it was about January - September 1966.  So then, it
occurred to me what I really wanted was the year book from 1968, which would
actually be about January 1967.

(I've sent these out periodically to a few lists. I'd really like to know
what others are reading, especially in areas that inform their poetics/
poetry/writing practice. - Alan)


Reviews of Numerous Wonderful Books

I haven't done these in a while; I'm fairly behind schedule. But there are
so many exciting things, new and used, that I feel the need to begin, even
if the reviews are encapsulated.

1 Prevention of Railroad Accidents or Safety in Railroading, George
Bradshaw, 1912. This is a small semi-paperback, profusely illustrated.
There are sections on how to move explosives and warnings about not
climbing on the front of a locomotive while it's moving towards you.
"Don't try to open knuckles as cars are about to come together." This
curious work opens a whole new world of course. Look for it!

2 The Book of Talismans, Amulets, and Zodaical Gems, Thomas and Pavitt,
1914. This is a wonder; there are ten plates plus one colored plate,
covering gnosticism, Egypt, India, the Koran, and so forth. A lengthly
section deals with the mystic qualities of gems. I believe this has been
reprinted..

3 The Ochre Robe, an autobiography, Agehananda Bharati. This is a troub-
ling book by an Austrian who wrote the brilliant The Tantric Tradition.
Bharati was somewhat of a follower of Bose; his account is oddly harsh,
"no-nonsense," and thereby wonderful. Bharati was an expert, among other
things, on Wittgenstein and the British philosophical tradition; his use
of language is precise. I can recommend both of these books without hes-
itation; The Tantric Tradition for example has an important section on
intentional language. (1970-80)

4 Selected Writings, Walter Benjamin, edited by Jennings, Eiland, and
Smith, Harvard, 2005 paperback, five volumes from the original hardcover
four. All I can say is Wow! These are absolutely amazing. I've been
working on a theory of "defuge" - the roots are here. There's enough to
keep cyberspatial theorists busy for years. The entries range from frag-
ment to extended essay, and there are probably a couple of hundred of
them. This, along with the full Arcades, has to be one of the monumental
philosophical/literary works of our time.

5 HTML & XHTML, The Definitive Guide, 6th edition, Musciano and Kennedy,
O'Reilly, 2007. I love this book (I received a review copy); I've used the
previous editions as well. It is intelligent, packed with information,
clear, and prescriptive; I can't recommend a better book for Web authors.
Everything from CSS and XML through URLs is clarified. Even if you only
use GUI editing software for Webpages, this gives you useful information
on what goes on "under the hood" - information that allows you to tweak
pages any way you want. There's a useful webpage for the book as well. The
book is also "Safari Enabled" - which allows you to access it entirely on
the Web for a fee. I used Safari for a while but realized I prefer my
books next to me; not everything has to be on the screen, not even texts
about online organization.

6 Death Scenes, A Homicide Detective's Scrapbook, Katherine Dunn, text;
edited by Sean Tejaratchi, Feral, 1996. I hadn't seen this before; it's
hard to look at. Bodies are blown apart, dismembered, hung, torn apart,
shot, knifed, and so forth. The detective is Jack Huddleston, who worked
in LA from the 20s to the 50s. Dunn's essay frames the material. The book
exposes one beyond CSI coolness; it's difficult to view without becoming
involved; instead of desensitization, one becomes aware, to a very raw
degree, of humanity's propensity towards violence and annihilation.
There's no way to "bypass" the images. I'd recommend this to everyone,
although one might have nightmares for days after.

7 Pancoast's Tokology and Ladies' Medical Guide, A Complete Instructor in
all the Delicate and Wonderful Matters Pertaining to Women, 1901-03, with
"many illustrations," by S. Pancoast M. D., enlarged and revised by Wesley
Cook. There's a description of plates - and the plates aren't there. There
are other plates that aren't listed. The text sometimes leaves the page
altogether due to printing errors, and the result is something like John
Furnival's concrete poetry. The text is also wonderful; testes, but not
the penis, are described; there are images of anomalies of the vagina, but
none of the "normal" vagina; images of deformed and joined babies
accompany the section on ("normal") childbirth, and the authors on one
hand applaud the emancipation of women and on the other decry suffrage.
What comes through with all of this is the incredible frailty of child-
birth at the time - so much could and did go wrong, as well as a medical
habitus that can report cases from 1650 or so as if they were relevant and
accurate in the early 20th-century. The book in other words is a pastiche
of anecdote and "strict" medical knowledge; it's troubling on all levels.

8 Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, reprinted numerous times from
1896, by George Gould and Walter Pyle. My edition is two volumes from
1937. This work, composed largely of anecdotes, many of which are
illustrated, is a guide to the monstrous; the images are in extremism. The
result is a semiotics of the plasticity of the human form; the stories
read something like Stekel or Ellis in tone. I think of this as an antique
cabinet of wonders, of course. One of the directions emphasized by many of
the older books above is the relative lack of structural principles; rumor
and exaggeration from the Greeks onward characterize a kind of fascinating
pseudo-science; the greater or more exaggerated the transformation, the
more it holds our interest.

9 The Baburnama, Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor, Thackston, 2002.
The emperor Babur, 1483-1530, wrote this personal chronicle of ethnog-
raphy, poetics, brutality and war. As the back cover says, this is "the
first autobiography in Islamic literature". The text is wonder to read out
of order; I found myself uninterested in the historical aspects, but very
interested in the description, for example, of Kabul. The introduction is
by Rushdie. I highly recommend this; it's like nothing I've ever read
before.

10 The History of Humayun, Humayun-Nama by Gul-Baden Begam, translated by
Beveridge, first published 1902. Gul-Baden Begam is Babur's daughter; this
account reveals a great deal about a mystic palace, weddings, court life,
and battles, from the viewpoint of an Islamic woman. I personally found
this the more interesting of the texts, but very different; the two should
be read together.

11 The Art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453, edited Cyril Mango, Toronto,
1986. Wonderful accounts of the building of St Sophia among other things.
I knew nothing about these texts, which are arranged thematically and
chronologically; there's a mystical account of the construction which is
quite beautiful. The book is texts only; there are no illustrations.

12 Ancient China's Technology and Science, "Compiled by the Institute of
the History of Natural Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences," Beijing,
1983. The sections on mathematics, the south-pointing chariot and odometer
are of great interest. There is a description of the abacus as well as
counting- or mathematical- sticks, which, for me, is quite important; I
wonder if the sticks are related to the Mah Jong counting sticks. In any
case, the sticks are used in quite a different manner than the usual; the
positions determine to some extent their orientation, and the numerical
value is calculated by horizontals and verticals. There's more than a bit
of the old Maoist propaganda here, but the book is invaluable as a
resource.

13 Emotions and Relations, Nan Goldin, David Armstrong, Mark Morrisroe,
Jack Pierson, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, curated F.C. Gundlach, Taschen,
1987. These photographs are friends and worked with and through one
another at times. The images are stark, disturbing, discomfiting no matter
how you try to frame them. In a different way, they remind me of the work
of Araki, who is also a disturbance, Larry Clark, others. When an image
abandons the punctum for a field incapable of recuperation, something
works on the subject in a radically different way. These aren't death
scenes but life scenes that simultaneously refuse, slide easily. I do
recommend the work of these photographers, Araki as well, creepy though he
may be.

14 A New Course in Reading Pali, Entering the Word of the Buddha, James W.
Gair and W.s. Karunatillake, Motilal, 1998-2005, and Introduction to Pali,
2nd edition, A.K. Warder, Pali Text Society, 1984. Thanks to Gabe Gudding
for the first of these, which contains, right from the beginning, texts
from the Canon. The Pali Canon is a large and complex collection of works
that stem from the time of the Buddha; they're the heart of the Theraveda.
Pali is the language of the Buddha as well; the texts that survive are
spiritual. Pali has no endemic, specific alphabet; there are a number in
use, including the Roman. The second book contains a more detailed grammar
as well as an extended Pali-English, English-Pali dictionary. Both are
beautiful; I never will learn Pali (I have no patience for anything,
including myself, at my age), but I begin to understand the grammar, the
"flow" of the language, which is tremendously exciting. I'd recommend the
first of these books primarily, but the second is necessary (I think) as
well.

15 Assyrian Language, Easy Lessons in the Cuneiform Inscriptions, L.W.
King, Routledge, 1901, reprinted by AMS. Cuneiform is impossibly diffi-
cult; I find that this book, although antiquated and quite possibly
incorrect, gives a good introduction to the syllabic aspects of the
script. It's a way in. Assyrian is related of course to Babylonian,
Akkadian, Hebrew, Arabic; it's semitic (and therefore fun!). This book has
proved far more useful than I thought it would. The book goes well with
Beginner's Assyrian, D.G. Lyon, reprinted by Hippocrene.

16. Fijian Grammar, G.B. Milner, Government Press, Fiji, 1972. I'm
fascinated by Hawaiian, Tahitian, Fijian. This is a somewhat complete
grammar; the author immediately departs from western categorizations,
using instead bases, common, particles, voice, etc. The bases and
particles are of particular interest, since they seem to point the way
towards another non-Indo-European semantics of great interest. This is one
of the most interesting language texts I've seen.

17 A Cultural History of Tibet, David Snellgrove and Hugh Richardson,
Shambhala, 1968. As with almost all the other books mentioned here, I have
no idea whether or not this is considered "accurate" by today's standards.
I wish I had known about this book earlier; it clarifies the country (at
least for me), provides somewhat of a foundation for thinking through all
those texts and practices in translation. There it is, at the beginning
and end of my library. Recommended as essential.

18 Nonduality, A Study in Comparative Philosophy, David Loy, 1988. Yes,
this is also recommended, also provides a path of thinking; western
references include Derrida; Buddhism, Vedanta, the Bhagavad-Gita, etc. are
covered in detail. I found the work illuminating; nonduality is opened and
released.

19 Field Theory in Social Science, Selected Theoretical Papers, Kurt
Lewin, Harpers, 1951. Mix with Lacan; Lewin developed a topological field
theory of personal and psychological processes; there are numerous
examples (with, I believe, dubious mathematical formulas) throughout. One
can go from here to Lacan to Sokal (who I think should be given a bit more
credence than he is). On the other hand, the topological tools and notion
of a field are quite useful; dynamic group processes, for example, are
analyzed in detail.

20 Revolt, She Said, Julia Kristeva, Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents Series.
Semiotext(e) is the Museum of Modern Art for theorists; it's simultan-
eously hip and canonical; the Semiotext(e) seal of approval extends far
beyond the size of the paperbacks. Be that as it may, Baudrilliard aside,
this is a great book, particularly for those who love Kristeva (as I do).
There are three interviews, the longest by Philippe Petit; one should
definitely read this, but not as an introduction to Kristeva - instead, a
kind of summing up, metacommentary, analysis.

21 Counter Daemons, Robert O. Harrison, Litmus Press, 2006, and Elemental
Song, Robert O. Harrison, <Answer>, 2006. Harrison sent me these books. I
thought they'd be problematic (he mentioned connection with computers).
This worried me. Instead, they're two of the most brilliant books of
poetry I've read, period. I hope to review them at greater length later.
Counter Daemons reflects both daemons in unix/linux and Socrates' daemon.
The "I" is insistent all the way through. Computer ideas are used beneath
the surface; they don't dominate, they're not codework, not subtext.
They're the dark matter of the writing. They suffuse the surface which is
the depth; they're not beneath it. The "I" reminds me (everything reminds
me of everything, apologies) of Nicanor Parra's Individual. It's demiurge,
Vedic. In Elemental Song, the stanzas are unrhymed triplets. There is an
"a" that begins the first five; there's a relation with the longer work. I
want to mention these because everyone should buy them. They're two of the
few books of writing I can carry around; they have that intimacy. The
cover of CD is by Brenda Iijima, one of the best I've seen.

22 Mary Magdalen, The Essential History, Susan Haskins, 2005. This is just
a terrific book to delve into. MM refuses framework, seeps; there is
little to go on historically. Sexuality is there from the beginning, as
perhaps are penitence and leadership. My Nikuko was partly based on MM; I
think she figures through the Preraphaelites and the Victorian in general.
In any case this is thoroughly researched stunning book that goes to the
heart of western culture.

23 The Dark Philosophers, Gwyn Thomas, Library of Wales, 1946-2006. These
three novelettes lie between Proust and P.D. James; the back cover insists
Thomas Hardy and Damon Runyon. I want to recommend the depths of these;
there is coal everywhere in the townscape, and the violence combined with
almost feudal conditions resonates with the coal regions of Pennsylvania
and West Virginia. I'm mesmerized by the stories (still haven't read the
third).

24 The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, Random
House, 1989. The Talmud and its hermeneutics are useful and originary for
textual analysis that mixes surface and depth inextricably. I want to
mention in particular A Reference Guide, which accompanies the Tractates.
There are sections on The Essential Nature of the Talmud, Aramaic, The
Book, Talmudic Terminology, Talmudic Hermeneutics, Halakhic Concepts and
Terms, etc. Some of the concepts defined and discussed: "There is no
absolute chronological order in the Torah." "If it does not refer to..."
"The verse speaks about the present." "Revealing something." This can
usefully be read in conjunction with Marc-Atain Ouaknin's The Burnt Book,
Reading the Talmud, perhaps the best book I've read on hermeneutics and
the phenomenology of the text.

25 Tumult on the Mountains, Lumbering in West Virginia, 1770-1920, Roy B.
Clarkson, first published 1964. I recommend this to anyone interested in
forestry and its environmental impact; almost all the old (first growth)
forest in West Virginia has disappeared. I never realized either the
extent of the damage or the density of the original forests; they remind
me of the old growth on Victoria Island. The Appalachians were almost
tropical; now almost all of this is lost, and the rest is disappearing
with the advent of mountain-topping. It's horrible; the Appalachians
constitute literally one of the thickest and most variegated ecosystems in
the world; as with the tropics, it's disappearing fast. The book is mainly
revealing photographs; there's a great deal on logging locomotives which
operated on somewhat different principles than the usual engines.

26 Hesiod's Theogony, translated and edited by Richard S. Caldwell, Focus
Classical Library, 1987. Caldwell makes sense of the genealogy; that alone
should give him a Pulitzer. The commentary is lengthy and excellent; if
you're interested in the text, this will be of great use.

27 The Complete Kama Sutra, Alain Danielou, Park Street, 1994. The KS is
one of the most and worst translated Sanskrit texts. This is an excellent
one (as far as I can tell), with two commentaries, one traditional and one
more or less modern. Because it's complete, there are sections on morals,
economics, conduct, and so forth, in relation to sexuality and mores. It's
far more interesting than the abbreviated versions.

28 Technological note again: I've been working with PAL cameras, both in
Europe and the US, and find them so far superior to NTSC that the con-
version and difficulty (in the US) is worth it. The reds stay red; they're
not mixed in with the luminance, and don't blur. The additional lines make
for a much sharper picture, somewhat close to HD. These cameras are more
than sufficient for anything online, relatively inexpensive, and a joy to
operate.

29, 30, 31, ... I wish I could read more, could go on! I'd like to cover,
in depth, the work of Joe Amato and the post-Yasusada work of Kent
Johnson. Amato's Virga Under is wonderful; I've been reading it on and
off, but not enough to do anything but recommend it. The same goes for
Kent Johnson's eloquent Lyric Poetry After Auschwitz. ... I've mentioned
Marguerite Young before; at this point I think I have all of her work here
- do check it out, give it time, delve into it; it's worth it. ... And I
think I've mentioned Paul Young's The Cinema Dreams its Rivals, Media
Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet, which covers the interrelation-
ships between film and video/cyberspace/radio and so forth; film is one of
the most inert, "insoluble" media - the others are aerial, virtual, always
already elsewhere. The interconnections among all of these reveal a lot
about our culture. ... Just found, literally on the sidewalk, Donald E.
Knuth's The TEXbook - TEX is a markup language developed by this famous
programmer, and this book, from 1984-86 is a complete guide to it. There
are a lot of escape keys and backslashings; the description is worth
reading even if one doesn't employ TEX. ... In French: Dictionnaire de la
prehistoire, Andre Leroi-Gourhan, Quadrige, Presses Universitaires de
France, 1988-97 - a beautiful book for delving into the (roughly) current
state of research in the field; there are probably thousands of sites
listed. ... Les Guerres de Demain, Pascal Boniface, Seuil, 2001 - so many
ways to die, so many types of war, we're always under the gun. I've been
reading this on and off; it's not fun - it's eerie. ... La Suisse de la
formation des Alpes a la quete du futur, pub Migros 1975 - I'd been
looking for a book dealing with the political/cultural/geographic/histor-
ical/etc. background to Switzerland; this seemed the best, in spite of its
age. It was 5 fr for 700 pages! Something to read on the plane trip back.
- English again: poems for teeth, Richard Loranger, We Press, 2005 - a
wonderful book of poetry (pardon the use of the same superlatives over and
over again) dealing with... teeth and their condition; it's oddly uncom-
fortable to read, and I hope to get to this later. Each tooth has a
section and a description - "Tooth of Memory" for example. I recommend
this not only for its oddness, but for that very discomfort; teeth are an
aporia of the body-bone itself, this is sensed throughout the book. -
Finally, why not end on The Ladies' Home Journal Treasury, edited by John
Mason Brown, Simon and Schuster, 1956? The writers include Eugene Field,
Helen Keller, John Steinbeck, Bill Malden, Ethel Waters, Marianne Moore,
Daphne du Maurier, Vachel Lindsay, and Jerome K. Jerome. There are full-
color illustrations from covers, advertisements, and page layouts. Really
recommended; it's a great view of America from, say, 1883 on.

== I offer no apologies for this close to endless listing (providing one
is doing modular arithmetic!); all of the above are useful and exciting.
I've been reading like a fiend, trying to keep up; so many of these back-
ground my own writing (which admittedly is a poor excuse, but ah well...)
- do check them out!

Dear all:

http://www.protv.ro/stiri/international/cameramanul-pro-tv-despre-tibetanii-mpu-ca-i-i-despre-brenciu.html

What you will see, read, is what I got to know
first-hand, having just returned from India's refugee
center for newcomers making illegal exit, fleeing
China through passes bordering Nepal. I spent two
months, more than, in North India - and this is my
third time in a year (which means I am entitled to an
opinion). It all requires a study, these issues, of
course, and a consistency in concern and commitment to
human dignity - regardless of "comfort zones".

I've often been attacked back-channel for my views
regarding PR China and expat poets parading around as
as open-minded Allen Ginsburgs or subterranean
subversives amid clamp downs to free speech and basic
rights - as if we had no responsibility to anyone or
anything (that dog-eat-dog, to quote RC). As if
exploiting a dirty little situation were not, well,
wrong. Maybe one can objectively conclude that since
nothing's really permanent and fools are cradling
their own karma, no sense in pretending anything does
matter outside of ME.

And I understand that most just don't know - can't
know - haven't the opportunity - or miss the layers
(mostly, alas, because of that status allocated to
race). And rights, of course, are only necessary for
the minority. But you can only understand as much, I
think, acutely so, byway of travel, study, thoughtful
contemplation.

Oh, just wondering, and surely trying to smile (a bit
in the face of it)!

Dear all:

Video footage that can be seen online of shootings of
Tibetans by Chinese border police on September 30
refutes official claims that the troops fired on the
group of Tibetans crossing the Nangpa Pass to Nepal
“in self-defence”.

The video footage, taken by a Romanian cameraman who
was at advance base camp on Mount Cho Oyo at the time
(www.protv.ro), depicts a line of Tibetans walking
uphill through the snow on the pass when a shot is
heard and one of the figures falls to the ground. The
video clearly depicts that the Tibetans had their
backs to the soldiers, were unarmed, and offered no
resistance. The nun, Kelsang Namtso, appears to have
been shot in the back.

In an unusual official account of the incident, China
said that Chinese frontier soldiers tried to persuade
the group of Tibetan “stowaways” to go home, but the
Tibetans refused and “attacked the soldiers”, who were
then “forced to defend themselves”. (People’s Daily,
October 13, and Xinhua, October 12). The Chinese
official account does acknowledge one death, but says
that it was from altitude sickness. On the same day
that the official account was released, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao denied
knowledge of the incident.

Mary Beth Markey, Executive Director of the
International Campaign for Tibet, said: “The Chinese
Xinhua statement belongs in the realm of fiction given
the evidence confirmed in this powerful footage. It is
deplorable that the People’s Armed Police act as if
shooting Tibetans crossing into Nepal is a legitimate
expression of their authority. ICT demands a full
accounting by the Chinese government, and assurances
of the safety of the children now apparently in the
custody of the Chinese military.”

During the shooting, a mountaineer in the cameraman’s
group can be heard saying: “They are shooting them
like dogs.” Sergiu Matei, a cameraman from Romania who
was on his first climbing trip to Cho Oyu, west of
Mount Everest and near the border with Nepal, told ICT
that he and his group saw the line of Tibetans snaking
up the pass, and ten or more soldiers near advance
base camp opening fire. “We saw one person falling
down, and they didn’t get up. This must have been the
nun who died. We saw another person fall down too, but
later they got up - maybe this person was injured.”

Sergei Matei, who returned to Bucharest from the
Himalayas yesterday, also helped a Tibetan from one of
the groups escaping to Nepal across the Nangpa Pass
when he found him hidden in a toilet tent at advance
base camp. He said: “He was terrified and shaking. I
couldn’t think of what to say so I asked him if he was
going to see the Dalai Lama, and when he heard those
words he put his hands together in prayer. We hid him
in the mess tent for several hours and when it seemed
to be safe, I took him back onto the pass.”

A Czech climbing expedition leader, who also witnessed
the shooting, Josef Simunek, told ICT: “We felt as
though it was 20 years ago in our country in the
Communist time, when Czech soldiers killed Czech
citizens in their escape over the ‘Iron Curtain’.”

e-Greetings all:

Thought I would post this again just for good measure. I've received some
excellent responses already, but I was hoping to receive a few more. A few
seconds to jot down your off-the-top thoughts would be wonderful.

I'd like to try to continue to hold this informal survey each year, the
results of which I will again post on my blog. Any comments and flack gladly

I'm curious about which are your most respected venues for online and print

To where do you return regularly? Without which sites can't you live?

Please send your responses backchannel and thanks in advance!

Hi.

Wanted to let you know about two things of mine
recently getting a home online:

PREHAB, a collaboration with graphic designer Dirk Rowntree =97
tiny phrases/poems made into a video sequence of typographical
mystery & magic.
(This premiered last year as part of my sound installation at Diapason).
Now up on the invaluable Ubu.com site:

http://www.ubu.com/contemp/andrews/PrehabUbu.mov


& second, from 2 weeks ago on the Bill O'Reilly Report on Fox News
(my 'debut' on national television), the video clip now up on Youtube.com.
5 minutes of notoriety, as O'Reilly's "Outrage of the Week!", attacked for
the anti-Bush/Iraq slant of my political science courses at Fordham:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DuTKp-XYWaOc

Enjoy =97
& hope to see you soon,
                                                Bruce

I once had a show with a photographer Lloyd Trainor.I
was interested in making poetry more visual and
visceral, something that would have an impact on a
reader, whether or not s/he chose to "enter" the poem
completely. I was jealous of visual artists immediate
impact.The work was large and the pieces had to be
walked through, each poem 2-8 pages, on blotter paper
that was 2x5 ft. We collaborated on the theme light
and breath. At first our work answered each other,
like when two poets read together, themes, rhythms,
nuances that aligned; then we experimented. He began
to print negatives of photos, I broke poems..changed
their form, integrating the images as words or
silences..they became one piece. Great area to
explore, especially when the artists have an openness
and intuitive grasp of the other's voice.

Cinephrastics by Kathleen Ossip
A chapbook of movie poems

c 2006, 31 pages.

"Shadows whisper from the monoliths, shells open..."

6x6, staple-bound.

cover art by kate schapira.

Imagined in 2002 and established in 2004, horse less press is a bare-bones,
thin-skinned literary press housed in Providence, Rhode Island. We believe in
the necessary absence of every articulated thing. All our publications are
constructed by hand.

Mothers are smarter, calmer, braver
after the birth event, but the same
cannot be said of dad. The Caesars
foundered on the basics: empathy
compassion, like that. A squint of tears,
a range of pearlescent effects, a

Is a damaged Administration less likely to attack
Iran, or more?
Issue of 2006-11-27
Posted 2006-11-20

A month before the November elections, Vice-President
Dick Cheney was sitting in on a national-security
discussion at the Executive Office Building. The talk
took a political turn: what if the Democrats won both
the Senate and the House? How would that affect policy
toward Iran, which is believed to be on the verge of
becoming a nuclear power? At that point, according to
someone familiar with the discussion, Cheney began
reminiscing about his job as a lineman, in the early
nineteen-sixties, for a power company in Wyoming.
Copper wire was expensive, and the linemen were
instructed to return all unused pieces three feet or
longer. No one wanted to deal with the paperwork that
resulted, Cheney said, so he and his colleagues found
a solution: putting “shorteners” on the wire—that is,
cutting it into short pieces and tossing the leftovers
at the end of the workday. If the Democrats won on
November 7th, the Vice-President said, that victory
would not stop the Administration from pursuing a
military option with Iran. The White House would put
“shorteners” on any legislative restrictions, Cheney
said, and thus stop Congress from getting in its way.

The White House’s concern was not that the Democrats
would cut off funds for the war in Iraq but that
future legislation would prohibit it from financing
operations targeted at overthrowing or destabilizing
the Iranian government, to keep it from getting the
bomb. “They’re afraid that Congress is going to vote a
binding resolution to stop a hit on Iran, à la
Nicaragua in the Contra war,” a former senior
intelligence official told me.

In late 1982, Edward P. Boland, a Democratic
representative, introduced the first in a series of
“Boland amendments,” which limited the Reagan
Administration’s ability to support the Contras, who
were working to overthrow Nicaragua’s left-wing
Sandinista government. The Boland restrictions led
White House officials to orchestrate illegal
fund-raising activities for the Contras, including the
sale of American weapons, via Israel, to Iran. The
result was the Iran-Contra scandal of the
mid-eighties. Cheney’s story, according to the source,
was his way of saying that, whatever a Democratic
Congress might do next year to limit the President’s
authority, the Administration would find a way to work
around it. (In response to a request for comment, the
Vice-President’s office said that it had no record of
the discussion.)

In interviews, current and former Administration
officials returned to one question: whether Cheney
would be as influential in the last two years of
George W. Bush’s Presidency as he was in its first
six. Cheney is emphatic about Iraq. In late October,
he told Time, “I know what the President thinks,”
about Iraq. “I know what I think. And we’re not
looking for an exit strategy. We’re looking for
victory.” He is equally clear that the Administration
would, if necessary, use force against Iran. “The
United States is keeping all options on the table in
addressing the irresponsible conduct of the regime,”
he told an Israeli lobbying group early this year.
“And we join other nations in sending that regime a
clear message: we will not allow Iran to have a
nuclear weapon.”

On November 8th, the day after the Republicans lost
both the House and the Senate, Bush announced the
resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,
and the nomination of his successor, Robert Gates, a
former director of Central Intelligence. The move was
widely seen as an acknowledgment that the
Administration was paying a political price for the
debacle in Iraq. Gates was a member of the Iraq Study
Group—headed by former Secretary of State James Baker
and Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic
congressman—which has been charged with examining new
approaches to Iraq, and he has publicly urged for more
than a year that the U.S. begin direct talks with
Iran. President Bush’s decision to turn to Gates was a
sign of the White House’s “desperation,” a former
high-level C.I.A. official, who worked with the White
House after September 11th, told me. Cheney’s
relationship with Rumsfeld was among the closest
inside the Administration, and Gates’s nomination was
seen by some Republicans as a clear signal that the
Vice-President’s influence in the White House could be
challenged. The only reason Gates would take the job,
after turning down an earlier offer to serve as the
new Director of National Intelligence, the former
high-level C.I.A. official said, was that “the
President’s father, Brent Scowcroft, and James
Baker”—former aides of the first President Bush—“piled
on, and the President finally had to accept adult
supervision.”

Critical decisions will be made in the next few
months, the former C.I.A. official said. “Bush has
followed Cheney’s advice for six years, and the story
line will be: ‘Will he continue to choose Cheney over
his father?’ We’ll know soon.” (The White House and
the Pentagon declined to respond to detailed requests
for comment about this article, other than to say that
there were unspecified inaccuracies.)

A retired four-star general who worked closely with
the first Bush Administration told me that the Gates
nomination means that Scowcroft, Baker, the elder
Bush, and his son “are saying that winning the
election in 2008 is more important than the
individual. The issue for them is how to preserve the
Republican agenda. The Old Guard wants to isolate
Cheney and give their girl, Condoleezza Rice”—the
Secretary of State—“a chance to perform.” The
combination of Scowcroft, Baker, and the senior Bush
working together is, the general added, “tough enough
to take on Cheney. One guy can’t do it.”

Richard Armitage, the Deputy Secretary of State in
Bush’s first term, told me that he believed the
Democratic election victory, followed by Rumsfeld’s
dismissal, meant that the Administration “has backed
off,” in terms of the pace of its planning for a
military campaign against Iran. Gates and other
decision-makers would now have more time to push for a
diplomatic solution in Iran and deal with other,
arguably more immediate issues. “Iraq is as bad as it
looks, and Afghanistan is worse than it looks,”
Armitage said. “A year ago, the Taliban were fighting
us in units of eight to twelve, and now they’re
sometimes in company-size, and even larger.” Bombing
Iran and expecting the Iranian public “to rise up” and
overthrow the government, as some in the White House
believe, Armitage added, “is a fool’s errand.”

“Iraq is the disaster we have to get rid of, and Iran
is the disaster we have to avoid,” Joseph Cirincione,
the vice-president for national security at the
liberal Center for American Progress, said. “Gates
will be in favor of talking to Iran and listening to
the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but the
neoconservatives are still there”—in the White
House—“and still believe that chaos would be a small
price for getting rid of the threat. The danger is
that Gates could be the new Colin Powell—the one who
opposes the policy but ends up briefing the Congress
and publicly supporting it.”

Other sources close to the Bush family said that the
machinations behind Rumsfeld’s resignation and the
Gates nomination were complex, and the seeming triumph
of the Old Guard may be illusory. The former senior
intelligence official, who once worked closely with
Gates and with the President’s father, said that Bush
and his immediate advisers in the White House
understood by mid-October that Rumsfeld would have to
resign if the result of the midterm election was a
resounding defeat. Rumsfeld was involved in
conversations about the timing of his departure with
Cheney, Gates, and the President before the election,
the former senior intelligence official said. Critics
who asked why Rumsfeld wasn’t fired earlier, a move
that might have given the Republicans a boost, were
missing the point. “A week before the election, the
Republicans were saying that a Democratic victory was
the seed of American retreat, and now Bush and Cheney
are going to change their national-security policies?”
the former senior intelligence official said. “Cheney
knew this was coming. Dropping Rummy after the
election looked like a conciliatory move—‘You’re
right, Democrats. We got a new guy and we’re looking
at all the options. Nothing is ruled out.’ ” But the
conciliatory gesture would not be accompanied by a
significant change in policy; instead, the White House
saw Gates as someone who would have the credibility to
help it stay the course on Iran and Iraq. Gates would
also be an asset before Congress. If the
Administration needed to make the case that Iran’s
weapons program posed an imminent threat, Gates would
be a better advocate than someone who had been
associated with the flawed intelligence about Iraq.
The former official said, “He’s not the guy who told
us there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and
he’ll be taken seriously by Congress.”

Once Gates is installed at the Pentagon, he will have
to contend with Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Rumsfeld
legacy—and Dick Cheney. A former senior Bush
Administration official, who has also worked with
Gates, told me that Gates was well aware of the
difficulties of his new job. He added that Gates would
not simply endorse the Administration’s policies and
say, “with a flag waving, ‘Go, go’ ”—especially at the
cost of his own reputation. “He does not want to see
thirty-five years of government service go out the
window,” the former official said. However, on the
question of whether Gates would actively stand up to
Cheney, the former official said, after a pause, “I
don’t know.”

Another critical issue for Gates will be the
Pentagon’s expanding effort to conduct clandestine and
covert intelligence missions overseas. Such activity
has traditionally been the C.I.A.’s responsibility,
but, as the result of a systematic push by Rumsfeld,
military covert actions have been substantially
increased. In the past six months, Israel and the
United States have also been working together in
support of a Kurdish resistance group known as the
Party for Free Life in Kurdistan. The group has been
conducting clandestine cross-border forays into Iran,
I was told by a government consultant with close ties
to the Pentagon civilian leadership, as “part of an
effort to explore alternative means of applying
pressure on Iran.” (The Pentagon has established
covert relationships with Kurdish, Azeri, and Baluchi
tribesmen, and has encouraged their efforts to
undermine the regime’s authority in northern and
southeastern Iran.) The government consultant said
that Israel is giving the Kurdish group “equipment and
training.” The group has also been given “a list of
targets inside Iran of interest to the U.S.” (An
Israeli government spokesman denied that Israel was
involved.)

Such activities, if they are considered military
rather than intelligence operations, do not require
congressional briefings. For a similar C.I.A.
operation, the President would, by law, have to issue
a formal finding that the mission was necessary, and
the Administration would have to brief the senior
leadership of the House and the Senate. The lack of
such consultation annoyed some Democrats in Congress.
This fall, I was told, Representative David Obey, of
Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations subcommittee that finances classified
military activity, pointedly asked, during a closed
meeting of House and Senate members, whether “anyone
has been briefing on the Administration’s plan for
military activity in Iran.” The answer was no. (A
spokesman for Obey confirmed this account.)

The Democratic victories this month led to a surge of
calls for the Administration to begin direct talks
with Iran, in part to get its help in settling the
conflict in Iraq. British Prime Minister Tony Blair
broke ranks with President Bush after the election and
declared that Iran should be offered “a clear
strategic choice” that could include a “new
partnership” with the West. But many in the White
House and the Pentagon insist that getting tough with
Iran is the only way to salvage Iraq. “It’s a classic
case of ‘failure forward,’” a Pentagon consultant
said. “They believe that by tipping over Iran they
would recover their losses in Iraq—like doubling your
bet. It would be an attempt to revive the concept of
spreading democracy in the Middle East by creating one
new model state.”

The view that there is a nexus between Iran and Iraq
has been endorsed by Condoleezza Rice, who said last
month that Iran “does need to understand that it is
not going to improve its own situation by stirring
instability in Iraq,” and by the President, who said,
in August, that “Iran is backing armed groups in the
hope of stopping democracy from taking hold” in Iraq.
The government consultant told me, “More and more
people see the weakening of Iran as the only way to
save Iraq.”

The consultant added that, for some advocates of
military action, “the goal in Iran is not regime
change but a strike that will send a signal that
America still can accomplish its goals. Even if it
does not destroy Iran’s nuclear network, there are
many who think that thirty-six hours of bombing is the
only way to remind the Iranians of the very high cost
of going forward with the bomb—and of supporting
Moqtada al-Sadr and his pro-Iran element in Iraq.”
(Sadr, who commands a Shiite militia, has religious
ties to Iran.)

In the current issue of Foreign Policy, Joshua
Muravchik, a prominent neoconservative, argued that
the Administration had little choice. “Make no
mistake: President Bush will need to bomb Iran’s
nuclear facilities before leaving office,” he wrote.
The President would be bitterly criticized for a
preëmptive attack on Iran, Muravchik said, and so
neoconservatives “need to pave the way intellectually
now and be prepared to defend the action when it
comes.”

The main Middle East expert on the Vice-President’s
staff is David Wurmser, a neoconservative who was a
strident advocate for the invasion of Iraq and the
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Like many in Washington,
Wurmser “believes that, so far, there’s been no price
tag on Iran for its nuclear efforts and for its
continuing agitation and intervention inside Iraq,”
the consultant said. But, unlike those in the
Administration who are calling for limited strikes,
Wurmser and others in Cheney’s office “want to end the
regime,” the consultant said. “They argue that there
can be no settlement of the Iraq war without regime
change in Iran.”

The Administration’s planning for a military attack on
Iran was made far more complicated earlier this fall
by a highly classified draft assessment by the C.I.A.
challenging the White House’s assumptions about how
close Iran might be to building a nuclear bomb. The
C.I.A. found no conclusive evidence, as yet, of a
secret Iranian nuclear-weapons program running
parallel to the civilian operations that Iran has
declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
(The C.I.A. declined to comment on this story.)

The C.I.A.’s analysis, which has been circulated to
other agencies for comment, was based on technical
intelligence collected by overhead satellites, and on
other empirical evidence, such as measurements of the
radioactivity of water samples and smoke plumes from
factories and power plants. Additional data have been
gathered, intelligence sources told me, by high-tech
(and highly classified) radioactivity-detection
devices that clandestine American and Israeli agents
placed near suspected nuclear-weapons facilities
inside Iran in the past year or so. No significant
amounts of radioactivity were found.

A current senior intelligence official confirmed the
existence of the C.I.A. analysis, and told me that the
White House had been hostile to it. The White House’s
dismissal of the C.I.A. findings on Iran is widely
known in the intelligence community. Cheney and his
aides discounted the assessment, the former senior
intelligence official said. “They’re not looking for a
smoking gun,” the official added, referring to
specific intelligence about Iranian nuclear planning.
“They’re looking for the degree of comfort level they
think they need to accomplish the mission.” The
Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency also challenged
the C.I.A.’s analysis. “The D.I.A. is fighting the
agency’s conclusions, and disputing its approach,” the
former senior intelligence official said. Bush and
Cheney, he added, can try to prevent the C.I.A.
assessment from being incorporated into a forthcoming
National Intelligence Estimate on Iranian nuclear
capabilities, “but they can’t stop the agency from
putting it out for comment inside the intelligence
community.” The C.I.A. assessment warned the White
House that it would be a mistake to conclude that the
failure to find a secret nuclear-weapons program in
Iran merely meant that the Iranians had done a good
job of hiding it. The former senior intelligence
official noted that at the height of the Cold War the
Soviets were equally skilled at deception and
misdirection, yet the American intelligence community
was readily able to unravel the details of their
long-range-missile and nuclear-weapons programs. But
some in the White House, including in Cheney’s office,
had made just such an assumption—that “the lack of
evidence means they must have it,” the former official
said.

Iran is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty,
under which it is entitled to conduct nuclear research
for peaceful purposes. Despite the offer of trade
agreements and the prospect of military action, it
defied a demand by the I.A.E.A. and the Security
Council, earlier this year, that it stop enriching
uranium—a process that can produce material for
nuclear power plants as well as for weapons—and it has
been unable, or unwilling, to account for traces of
plutonium and highly enriched uranium that have been
detected during I.A.E.A. inspections. The I.A.E.A. has
complained about a lack of “transparency,” although,
like the C.I.A., it has not found unambiguous evidence
of a secret weapons program.

Last week, Iran’s President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
announced that Iran had made further progress in its
enrichment research program, and said, “We know that
some countries may not be pleased.” He insisted that
Iran was abiding by international agreements, but
said, “Time is now completely on the side of the
Iranian people.” A diplomat in Vienna, where the
I.A.E.A. has its headquarters, told me that the agency
was skeptical of the claim, for technical reasons. But
Ahmadinejad’s defiant tone did nothing to diminish
suspicions about Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

“There is no evidence of a large-scale covert
enrichment program inside Iran,” one involved European
diplomat said. “But the Iranians would not have
launched themselves into a very dangerous
confrontation with the West on the basis of a weapons
program that they no longer pursue. Their enrichment
program makes sense only in terms of wanting nuclear
weapons. It would be inconceivable if they weren’t
cheating to some degree. You don’t need a covert
program to be concerned about Iran’s nuclear
ambitions. We have enough information to be concerned
without one. It’s not a slam dunk, but it’s close to
it.”

There are, however, other possible reasons for Iran’s
obstinacy. The nuclear program—peaceful or not—is a
source of great national pride, and President
Ahmadinejad’s support for it has helped to propel him
to enormous popularity. (Saddam Hussein created
confusion for years, inside and outside his country,
about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, in
part to project an image of strength.) According to
the former senior intelligence official, the C.I.A.’s
assessment suggested that Iran might even see some
benefits in a limited military strike—especially one
that did not succeed in fully destroying its nuclear
program—in that an attack might enhance its position
in the Islamic world. “They learned that in the Iraqi
experience, and relearned it in southern Lebanon,” the
former senior official said. In both cases, a more
powerful military force had trouble achieving its
military or political goals; in Lebanon, Israel’s war
against Hezbollah did not destroy the group’s entire
arsenal of rockets, and increased the popularity of
its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The former senior intelligence official added that the
C.I.A. assessment raised the possibility that an
American attack on Iran could end up serving as a
rallying point to unite Sunni and Shiite populations.
“An American attack will paper over any differences in
the Arab world, and we’ll have Syrians, Iranians,
Hamas, and Hezbollah fighting against us—and the
Saudis and the Egyptians questioning their ties to the
West. It’s an analyst’s worst nightmare—for the first
time since the caliphate there will be common cause in
the Middle East.” (An Islamic caliphate ruled the
Middle East for over six hundred years, until the
thirteenth century.)

According to the Pentagon consultant, “The C.I.A.’s
view is that, without more intelligence, a large-scale
bombing attack would not stop Iran’s nuclear program.
And a low-end campaign of subversion and sabotage
would play into Iran’s hands—bolstering support for
the religious leadership and deepening anti-American
Muslim rage.”

The Pentagon consultant said that he and many of his
colleagues in the military believe that Iran is intent
on developing nuclear-weapons capability. But he added
that the Bush Administration’s options for dealing
with that threat are diminished, because of a lack of
good intelligence and also because “we’ve cried wolf”
before.

As the C.I.A.’s assessment was making its way through
the government, late this summer, current and former
military officers and consultants told me, a new
element suddenly emerged: intelligence from Israeli
spies operating inside Iran claimed that Iran has
developed and tested a trigger device for a nuclear
bomb. The provenance and significance of the human
intelligence, or HUMINT, are controversial. “The
problem is that no one can verify it,” the former
senior intelligence official told me. “We don’t know
who the Israeli source is. The briefing says the
Iranians are testing trigger mechanisms”—simulating a
zero-yield nuclear explosion without any weapons-grade
materials—“but there are no diagrams, no significant
facts. Where is the test site? How often have they
done it? How big is the warhead—a breadbox or a
refrigerator? They don’t have that.” And yet, he said,
the report was being used by White House hawks within
the Administration to “prove the White House’s theory
that the Iranians are on track. And tests leave no
radioactive track, which is why we can’t find it.”
Still, he said, “The agency is standing its ground.”

The Pentagon consultant, however, told me that he and
other intelligence professionals believe that the
Israeli intelligence should be taken more seriously.
“We live in an era when national technical
intelligence”—data from satellites and on-the-ground
sensors—“will not get us what we need. HUMINT may not
be hard evidence by that standard, but very often it’s
the best intelligence we can get.” He added, with
obvious exasperation, that within the intelligence
community “we’re going to be fighting over the quality
of the information for the next year.” One reason for
the dispute, he said, was that the White House had
asked to see the “raw”—the original, unanalyzed and
unvetted—Israeli intelligence. Such “stovepiping” of
intelligence had led to faulty conclusions about
nonexistent weapons of mass destruction during the
buildup to the 2003 Iraq war. “Many Presidents in the
past have done the same thing,” the consultant said,
“but intelligence professionals are always aghast when
Presidents ask for stuff in the raw. They see it as
asking a second grader to read ‘Ulysses.’ ”

HUMINT can be difficult to assess. Some of the most
politically significant—and most
inaccurate—intelligence about Iraq’s alleged weapons
of mass destruction came from an operative, known as
Curveball, who was initially supplied to the C.I.A. by
German intelligence. But the Pentagon consultant
insisted that, in this case, “the Israeli intelligence
is apparently very strong.” He said that the
information about the trigger device had been
buttressed by another form of highly classified data,
known as MASINT, for “measuring and signature”
intelligence. The Defense Intelligence Agency is the
central processing and dissemination point for such
intelligence, which includes radar, radio, nuclear,
and electro-optical data. The consultant said that the
MASINT indicated activities that “are not consistent
with the programs” Iran has declared to the I.A.E.A.
“The intelligence suggests far greater sophistication
and more advanced development,” the consultant said.
“The indications don’t make sense, unless they’re
farther along in some aspects of their nuclear-weapons
program than we know.”

In early 2004, John Bolton, who was then the
Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control (he is now
the United Nations Ambassador), privately conveyed to
the I.A.E.A. suspicions that Iran was conducting
research into the intricately timed detonation of
conventional explosives needed to trigger a nuclear
warhead at Parchin, a sensitive facility twenty miles
southeast of Tehran that serves as the center of
Iran’s Defense Industries Organization. A wide array
of chemical munitions and fuels, as well as advanced
antitank and ground-to-air missiles, are manufactured
there, and satellite imagery appeared to show a bunker
suitable for testing very large explosions.

A senior diplomat in Vienna told me that, in response
to the allegations, I.A.E.A. inspectors went to
Parchin in November of 2005, after months of
negotiation. An inspection team was allowed to single
out a specific site at the base, and then was granted
access to a few buildings there. “We found no evidence
of nuclear materials,” the diplomat said. The
inspectors looked hard at an underground
explosive-testing pit that, he said, “resembled what
South Africa had when it developed its nuclear
weapons,” three decades ago. The pit could have been
used for the kind of kinetic research needed to test a
nuclear trigger. But, like so many military facilities
with dual-use potential, “it also could be used for
other things,” such as testing fuel for rockets, which
routinely takes place at Parchin. “The Iranians have
demonstrated that they can enrich uranium,” the
diplomat added, “and trigger tests without nuclear
yield can be done. But it’s a very sophisticated
process—it’s also known as hydrodynamic testing—and
only countries with suitably advanced nuclear testing
facilities as well as the necessary scientific
expertise can do it. I’d be very skeptical that Iran
could do it.”

Earlier this month, the allegations about Parchin
reëmerged when Yediot Ahronot, Israel’s largest
newspaper, reported that recent satellite imagery
showed new “massive construction” at Parchin,
suggesting an expansion of underground tunnels and
chambers. The newspaper sharply criticized the
I.A.E.A.’s inspection process and its director, Dr.
Mohamed ElBaradei, for his insistence on “using very
neutral wording for his findings and his conclusions.”

Patrick Clawson, an expert on Iran who is the deputy
director for research at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, a conservative think tank, told me
that the “biggest moment” of tension has yet to
arrive: “How does the United States keep an Israeli
decision point—one that may come sooner than we
want—from being reached?” Clawson noted that there is
evidence that Iran has been slowed by technical
problems in the construction and operation of two
small centrifuge cascades, which are essential for the
pilot production of enriched uranium. Both are now
under I.A.E.A. supervision. “Why were they so slow in
getting the second cascade up and running?” Clawson
asked. “And why haven’t they run the first one as much
as they said they would? Do we have more time?

“Why talk about war?” he said. “We’re not talking
about going to war with North Korea or Venezuela. It’s
not necessarily the case that Iran has started a
weapons program, and it’s conceivable—just
conceivable—that Iran does not have a nuclear-weapons
program yet. We can slow them down—force them to
reinvent the wheel—without bombing, especially if the
international conditions get better.”

Clawson added that Secretary of State Rice has “staked
her reputation on diplomacy, and she will not risk her
career without evidence. Her team is saying, ‘What’s
the rush?’ The President wants to solve the Iranian
issue before leaving office, but he may have to say,
‘Darn, I wish I could have solved it.’ ”

Earlier this year, the government of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert created a task force to
coördinate all the available intelligence on Iran. The
task force, which is led by Major General Eliezer
Shkedi, the head of the Israeli Air Force, reports
directly to the Prime Minister. In late October,
Olmert appointed Ephraim Sneh, a Labor Party member of
the Knesset, to serve as Deputy Defense Minister.
Sneh, who served previously in that position under
Ehud Barak, has for years insisted that action be
taken to prevent Iran from getting the bomb. In an
interview this month with the Jerusalem Post, Sneh
expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of
diplomacy or international sanctions in curbing Iran:

The danger isn’t as much Ahmadinejad’s deciding to
launch an attack but Israel’s living under a dark
cloud of fear from a leader committed to its
destruction. . . . Most Israelis would prefer not to
live here; most Jews would prefer not to come here
with families, and Israelis who can live abroad will .
. . I am afraid Ahmadinejad will be able to kill the
Zionist dream without pushing a button. That’s why we
must prevent this regime from obtaining nuclear
capability at all costs.

A similar message was delivered by Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Likud leader, in a speech in Los Angeles last
week. “It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany. And Iran is
racing to arm itself with atomic bombs,” he said,
adding that there was “still time” to stop the
Iranians.

The Pentagon consultant told me that, while there may
be pressure from the Israelis, “they won’t do anything
on their own without our green light.” That assurance,
he said, “comes from the Cheney shop. It’s Cheney
himself who is saying, ‘We’re not going to leave you
high and dry, but don’t go without us.’ ” A senior
European diplomat agreed: “For Israel, it is a
question of life or death. The United States does not
want to go into Iran, but, if Israel feels more and
more cornered, there may be no other choice.”

A nuclear-armed Iran would not only threaten Israel.
It could trigger a strategic-arms race throughout the
Middle East, as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt—all
led by Sunni governments—would be compelled to take
steps to defend themselves. The Bush Administration,
if it does take military action against Iran, would
have support from Democrats as well as Republicans.
Senators Hillary Clinton, of New York, and Evan Bayh,
of Indiana, who are potential Democratic Presidential
candidates, have warned that Iran cannot be permitted
to build a bomb and that—as Clinton said earlier this
year—“we cannot take any option off the table.” Howard
Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, has also endorsed this view. Last May,
Olmert was given a rousing reception when he addressed
a joint session of Congress and declared, “A nuclear
Iran means a terrorist state could achieve the primary
mission for which terrorists live and die—the mass
destruction of innocent human life. This challenge,
which I believe is the test of our time, is one the
West cannot afford to fail.”

Despite such rhetoric, Leslie Gelb, a former State
Department official who is a president emeritus of the
Council on Foreign Relations, said he believes that,
“when push comes to shove, the Israelis will have a
hard time selling the idea that an Iranian nuclear
capability is imminent. The military and the State
Department will be flat against a preëmptive bombing
campaign.” Gelb said he hoped that Gates’s appointment
would add weight to America’s most pressing issue—“to
get some level of Iranian restraint inside Iraq. In
the next year or two, we’re much more likely to be
negotiating with Iran than bombing it.”

The Bush Administration remains publicly committed to
a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear impasse,
and has been working with China, Russia, France,
Germany, and Britain to get negotiations under way. So
far, that effort has foundered; the most recent round
of talks broke up early in November, amid growing
disagreements with Russia and China about the
necessity of imposing harsh United Nations sanctions
on the Iranian regime. President Bush is adamant that
Iran must stop all of its enrichment programs before
any direct talks involving the United States can
begin.

The senior European diplomat told me that the French
President, Jacques Chirac, and President Bush met in
New York on September 19th, as the new U.N. session
was beginning, and agreed on what the French called
the “Big Bang” approach to breaking the deadlock with
Iran. A scenario was presented to Ali Larijani, the
chief Iranian negotiator on nuclear issues. The
Western delegation would sit down at a negotiating
table with Iran. The diplomat told me, “We would say,
‘We’re beginning the negotiations without
preconditions,’ and the Iranians would respond, ‘We
will suspend.’ Our side would register great
satisfaction, and the Iranians would agree to accept
I.A.E.A. inspection of their enrichment facilities.
And then the West would announce, in return, that they
would suspend any U.N. sanctions.” The United States
would not be at the table when the talks began but
would join later. Larijani took the offer to Tehran;
the answer, as relayed by Larijani, was no, the
diplomat said. “We were trying to compromise, for all
sides, but Ahmadinejad did not want to save face,” the
diplomat said. “The beautiful scenario has gone
nowhere.”

Last week, there was a heightened expectation that the
Iraq Study Group would produce a set of
recommendations that could win bipartisan approval and
guide America out of the quagmire in Iraq. Sources
with direct knowledge of the panel’s proceedings have
told me that the group, as of mid-November, had ruled
out calling for an immediate and complete American
withdrawal but would recommend focussing on the
improved training of Iraqi forces and on redeploying
American troops. In the most significant
recommendation, Baker and Hamilton were expected to
urge President Bush to do what he has thus far refused
to do—bring Syria and Iran into a regional conference
to help stabilize Iraq.

It is not clear whether the Administration will be
receptive. In August, according to the former senior
intelligence official, Rumsfeld asked the Joint Chiefs
to quietly devise alternative plans for Iraq, to
preëmpt new proposals, whether they come from the new
Democratic majority or from the Iraq Study Group. “The
option of last resort is to move American forces out
of the cities and relocate them along the Syrian and
Iranian border,” the former official said. “Civilians
would be hired to train the Iraqi police, with the
eventual goal of separating the local police from the
Iraqi military. The White House believes that if
American troops stay in Iraq long enough—with enough
troops—the bad guys will end up killing each other,
and Iraqi citizens, fed up with internal strife, will
come up with a solution. It’ll take a long time to
move the troops and train the police. It’s a time line
to infinity.”

In a subsequent interview, the former senior Bush
Administration official said that he had also been
told that the Pentagon has been at work on a plan in
Iraq that called for a military withdrawal from the
major urban areas to a series of fortified bases near
the borders. The working assumption was that, with the
American troops gone from the most heavily populated
places, the sectarian violence would “burn out.” “The
White House is saying it’s going to stabilize,” the
former senior Administration official said, “but it
may stabilize the wrong way.”

One problem with the proposal that the Administration
enlist Iran in reaching a settlement of the conflict
in Iraq is that it’s not clear that Iran would be
interested, especially if the goal is to help the Bush
Administration extricate itself from a bad situation.

“Iran is emerging as a dominant power in the Middle
East,” I was told by a Middle East expert and former
senior Administration official. “With a nuclear
program, and an ability to interfere throughout the
region, it’s basically calling the shots. Why should
they coöperate with us over Iraq?” He recounted a
recent meeting with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who
challenged Bush’s right to tell Iran that it could not
enrich uranium. “Why doesn’t America stop enriching
uranium?” the Iranian President asked. He laughed, and
added, “We’ll enrich it for you and sell it to you at
a fifty-per-cent discount.”

Great debate between two giants, who happen to be good
friends - Clinton and Havel. Anyone remember Charter
77?

http://havel.columbia.edu/conversation.html

Both video and audio.

Would most certainly love to hear from anyone who was
fortunate enough to have attended this event.

Best,

thanks for http://havel.columbia.edu/conversation.html , alexander. i see
there is much more here than the forum with clinton and havel. for instance,
if you click the first "video" link and, once that window opens, click
"Select Presentation", there is quite a wealth of video material. For
instance, if you click "Literature and Citizenship", you encounter
conversation involving Orhan Pamuk. And Milos Forman's anecdotes about Havel
are terrific.

In case you do not take in Ron Silliman on a regular basis, today (Monday)
he takes a close, extended look at
 Exploring The Bancroft Library: The Centennial Guide to Its Extraordinary
History, Spectacular Special Collections, Research Pleasures, Its Amazing
Future and How It All Works.  (Signature Books; 196 pages, 155
illustrations; 9.25 x 11"). (Normally I would not forsake my love of
bookstores, but this one is so badly distributed, I suggest Amazon or
Powells for the easiest access, including the normal, literal bookstore
killer discount)

Ron's review includes a most close focus on the book's attention to the Jack
Spicer archive.
    http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/

The book is one in which I was the primary editor - work that included four
wondrous years of my literally exploring the Library's different collections
-Rare Books & Manuscripts, Western and Latin Americana, Pictorial
Collections Science & Technology, Tebtunis Papyri, Mark Twain Papers,
Regional Oral History Project, and University Archives.  The book includes
work with about 18 variously competent contributors!

It's quite gratifying to get Ron's close & critical attention -

 Greetings

Thank you for the quote by Henry Adams. Very true. It meant almost as

“I write down what I feel in order to lower the fever of feeling…I make a
holiday of sensation…I unwind myself like a length of multicolored yarns, or
make cat’s cradles out of myself, like the ones children weave around stiff
fingers and pass from one to another. Taking care that my thumb doesn’t miss
the vital loop I turn it over to reveal a different pattern. Then I start
again.” – Fernando Pessoa

Dear all:

In about a month's time, I'll be heading back to the
States after too long away. Though a native of
Massachusetts, I think myself a a conglomerate of
adjustments (spent nearly 10 years in Wisconsin). Most
everything I love, in fact, seems situated in the
Midwest - hence reason for my re-settling here.
Anyway, after screeching on this list, writing poem
after poem abroad, I am looking to meet and listen -
and to share.

Please, should you have the time, sympathy, we'll call
it generous charity, send all the information -
backchannel or, better still, make public for those of
us new - on places to read and to listen to
established and new poets. Too, places to find a
hopelessly tattered (though charming) used book. Your
time really'll give me something to look forward to
just after Christmas.

I'll appreciate you assistance!

"The right words lead people to the truth."
Sakandar (Alexander)

A friend told me this story, and I wanted to share it: She is the founder
and executive director of The Translation Project
(www.thetranslationproject.com), one goal of which is to publish an
anthology that she has translated of contemporary Iranian poets writing in
Persian who live in diaspora/exile. (Full disclosure: I am on the advisory
board.) She recently attended the annual conference of the Middle Eastern
Studies Association, where she sat down with one of the foremost Persian
Studies literary scholars. She wanted to tell him about her project, get his
input, feedback, etc. He was, based on her telling, extremely rude and
sexist, letting her know in no uncertain terms that she did not project the
right kind of "image," strutting around the way she does, insisting on
having her say no matter who she is talking to, etc.

This is not a particularly new problem; women in academia have had to deal
with that kind of treatment for a long time. The specific part of her
encounter with this man that I think would be of interest to this
list--though it is also not new--is that he told her she could not create
her own canon, that he saw the anthology she has put together as, in fact,
an act of canon creation that she has had the audacity to commit outside the
academy and without first getting the academy's imprimatur. No one in
Persian Studies, as far as I know, or at least almost no one--and I am far
from well-informed on this topic; I am taking my friend's word about it--has
bothered to look at the work these poets are producing, and from what I can
tell, it is work that the non-Persian reading world ought to know about.
Persian Studies, it appears, has not yet moved beyond studying the
Shakespeares and Homers and Pounds and Eliots, etc. of its canon, and from
what my friend tells me, at least some of the big guns in Persian Studies
seem intent on shutting her out of any sort of intellectual legitimacy
because she has not kowtowed to them.

If what she's doing interests you, you ought to give her website a look, and
if you're a publisher and might be interested in her book, you should
contact her through the website.

The other thing The Translation Project is doing that I think would be of
interest to members of this list is producing multimedia performances that
combine the poetry from the anthology in the original Persian, the English
translation, music, video, dance and so on. You can see a trailer here:
http://www.thetranslationproject.com/index.php?cat=45.

Anyway, thanks for listening.....

Alexander --=20

where are you coming from? where are you headed to?=20

my wife and I have a fairly good list of visionary art environments /
religious grottos to check out in WI, IL, IA, even Minnesota (though
it's slim pickin's up here in gopher-land)... mIEKAL aND (dtv@MWT.NET)
probably has more to say on this: he's got his very own visionary art
grotto in the works in rural Wisconsin.

then there's the Weird USA franchise: there are currently two books I
know of -- Weird Wisconsin and Weird Minnesota... these are
coffee-table-size collections of stories about unusual places to see in
the states -- good on graphical presentation, kind of lousy when it

Subject: Poetry Midwest: Chicago - Milwaukee - Twin Cities

Dear all:

In about a month's time, I'll be heading back to the
States after too long away. Though a native of
Massachusetts, I think myself a a conglomerate of
adjustments (spent nearly 10 years in Wisconsin). Most
everything I love, in fact, seems situated in the
Midwest - hence reason for my re-settling here.
Anyway, after screeching on this list, writing poem
after poem abroad, I am looking to meet and listen -
and to share.

Please, should you have the time, sympathy, we'll call
it generous charity, send all the information -
backchannel or, better still, make public for those of
us new - on places to read and to listen to
established and new poets. Too, places to find a
hopelessly tattered (though charming) used book. Your
time really'll give me something to look forward to
just after Christmas.

I'll appreciate you assistance!

Recharging the Sensorium: CSU Presents a Writing/Multimedia Day of the =
Arts
Open to Students and Faculty=20
Friday, April 27th, 2007=20
On the campus of Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, CT =
06050
=20
INTRODUCTION
=20
CSU Systems Office in conjunction with the Connecticut Review, the Helix =
and Drunkenboat.com, online journal of the arts, present a day dedicated =
to the conjunction of text with other media. Despite the popular image =
of the solitary writer in a garret, writing is not an isolated art or =
stand-alone skill, especially these days. Writers=92 expressions of the =
written word regularly combine with film, music, photographs, paintings, =
graphic illustrations and other arts, creating new, collaborative forms =
of composition. Newspaper reporters' stories are brought to readers =
combined with photos from the field. Poets write lines to match music or =
find their lines set to music. Ekphrastic poetry, that is the verbal =
representation of visual representation, has grown exceedingly more =
popular. More and more, the web brings together multimedia elements with =
streaming audio and video, fine art photographs and paintings=97and an =
entire generation relies on the web for their information, entertainment =
and encounters with the arts. Here words are almost always embedded in a =
multimedia environment. The combination of words and multimedia is =
hardly new. Since the advent of recorded history, writing has come in a =
multimedia form. From the "performances" of scops, gleeman and jongleurs =
to illuminated manuscripts, language has often conjoined with the other =
arts.=20
=20
We invite students and faculty from the four CSU campuses and local high =
schools to think imaginatively about writing in terms of the new, =
extensive multimedia reality. Recharging the Sensorium, the inaugural =
Writing and Multimedia Day of the Arts will be devoted to examining the =
multiple connections between text and other media. It will address =
historical contexts and investigate the use of new technologies. This =
conference could potentially include collaborations across various =
disciplines such as (but not confined to) poetry, prose, visual culture, =
art history, musicology, photography, graphic novels, comparative =
literature, media archeology, dramaturgy, film, dance, performance, and =
the natural and behavioral sciences.=20
=20
CONFERENCE PROGRAM
=20
The conference program will include competitively selected, =
collaborative projects, as well as a small number of invited panelists =
and speakers. The conference will culminate in a keynote event that will =
feature the winners of Drunken Boat=92s inaugural PanLiterary Awards and =
contributors to the most recent issue of the Connecticut Review.=20
=20
The conference will also include panels on a variety of subjects, =
including editing print and online journals, multimedia processes, text =
and image, and the rapidly changing media environment. Accepted =
presenters will also have the chance to debut their work in a variety of =
forums=97in gallery space, on stage, in interactive displays and in =
forums. We will encourage all participants to engage in open-ended =
discussions that delve into relevant issues and questions. Potential =
projects include slide shows, dramatic performances, film (run in a loop =
or featured discretely), public navigation of unusual websites, the =
public showing of illustrated children's books, the production of =
graphic novels, musical scores, or operas, choreographed sound or =
performance pieces, dramatized readings, intersections of visual imagery =
and textuality, investigations into architecture and space as it relates =
to other media as well as any other projects that demonstrate the =
cross-pollination of the arts.
=20
CALL FOR PROPOSALS
=20
Recharging the Sensorium welcomes proposals that use at least two =
different media in its conception and execution. Collaborative projects =
are highly encouraged, but we will also accept solo proposals that =
propose to use at least two forms of expression (e.g. text and image). =
We are especially keen on proposals that explore the territory of =
interdisciplinary artworks. Please note that there is a limited funding =
available to help students and faculty members complete their proposed =
projects.=20
=20
Submissions should include the following information:=20
=20
1)   Name and contact information of the parties involved in the =
project, including their affiliation with an university or high school =
(e.g. student or faculty) if applicable=20
=20
2)   Brief Project Description: Spend no more than a page describing =
what it is you intend to do, how it involves the use of more than one =
media, and what the desired outcome of your project will be. Please feel =
free to include examples to buttress your ideas. You could mention =
similar kinds of projects, or models that you are basing your own =
project on.=20
=20
3)   Specifications: Please indicate what space and equipment you=92ll =
need for the composition, production and display of the work in =
question. If it is an artwork, indicate the expected dimensions and how =
you would see it situated. If it is a collaborative theatrical or =
musical piece, or a film, indicate the expected duration and how you =
would like the piece screened and/or choreographed. If it is a web-based =
artwork, please indicate what software you will be using to create the =
piece and how you would like the work viewed. If it involves props or =
any other equipment (projector, streaming video server, television, DVD =
player, frames, etc.), please also indicate that information.=20
=20
4)   Budget: To the best of your ability, please delineate how much you =
expect this project to cost and what you would spend any funding on. =
Please be aware that we only have a limited amount of funding at our =
disposal so requests may only be partially funded, depending on the =
feasibility and scope of the project. No budgets over $500 will be =
considered. Be as specific as you can.
=20
5)   Letter of Recommendation: If you are applying for funding, please =
also include a letter of recommendation from a professor or other =
established figure who can vouch for your creative/technical abilities =
and follow through.=20
=20
Email your proposal as a Word or .rtf document to: =
sensorium2007@gmail.com=20
=20
Feel free to include any urls, related graphic or sound files, or other =

I still don't think we've beaten this string DEAD, yet.=20

my traditionalist/elitist sensibilities balk at linguistic roadblocks

skip it, I say. and I do.

but the code writing as trojan horse, such as

"if zero is boundary, one is interior.
the boundary has zero area in relation to interior.
but the same order of the continuum.

"you can assign addresses one place or another.
these addresses are on the boundary.
the interior is emptied.
the interior is empty."

is certainly compelling to me -- and of course it's so "straight" that
you wonder, is that code writing? was "Dead," the original piece that
kicked this discussion off, really code writing, or an example of how
the mark of Sondheim is enough for people to question its origins?=20

does anyone know, apart from Alan's hairdresser, and his parents, and
instructors and other intimates? the act of questioning the source of
the text, the proposed meaning that is allegedly presented in the text,
enriches the experience of it.=20

"Directory danish ysbaddaden ysgithyrwyn zeus ziphius ziz zolostraya..."
has its moments -- its cockatrices in the dungheap -- but my own
response to 20 lines of this is to scan it and proceed. more elitism? am
I being a philistine?=20

last week I imagined two machines alternately sending poetry back and
forth to each other, responding with pleasure as they receive and then
compose a new poem -- we can see the response and composition activity
on a monitor, but we never get to see what they are reacting to.=20

it reminds me of a tech version of the Remedios Varo painting "The
Lovers," where the lovers on a parkbench have mirrors for faces, and
they stare into each other's "eyes" until steam swirls up above their
heads.

--

Angela calls his offering a "solid start," which seems to offend Alan...
an utterance is inherently time-bound, even if it's got a computer
date-stamp on it -- revision work makes a different draft, which is
necessarily a different text.=20

which makes the work of "completion" both treacherous and exceptionally
easy.=20

which leads to the question, does the work ever end?

God knows, I'm not the editor to dare working over lines like "ha ha ha
. ha ha ha a ha ha ha swah wah wah!" -- how would you edit this, if you
even wanted to? there's no point: it is perfected, whole, completed, as
it is -- your reaction is all that is required to finish the work.

I think the problem here is that, what one person senses as a need,=20
another doesn't. For me poetry has "needs" to have an intensity or
urgency - but I wouldn't want to generalize this to others. Instead
it translates as "this is what I'm interested in, this is what moves
me" - which is something else again.

Well, I'm not sure what a "solid start" means. The work is finished.
What=20
I am sure about - is that if one looks at code poetry, coded or encoded=20
writing, codework, e-poetry, etc., critique should, if it is to respond
at=20
least in part to the form and structure of the work, take into account
the=20
means of production, distribution, protocols, and codings - and take
this
into account in depth. Otherwise, it's only surface. Obviously people
work=20
through code etc. for a reason; it's not an appendage to a work, but
often=20
integral to it.

Here for example is part of a codework dealing with anguish, and the way

anguish interferes with, cauterizes language. So what happens is that a=20
"General Protection Fault" crashes the machine - a contradictory phrase=20
since faults don't protect, etc.

A moment when I think I might just be able to transform anguish into
philosophy. Of course that isn't true; one stays against the stays
of the other, as if moving solo across phenomenological waters. I
can't work this way. Is  make -k C:\dor.el

Why computer-generated poetry?

The movement of technology trends toward isolating the
individual from the physical, social environment -- video
games instead of games, E-mail instead of conversations,
Amazon instead of bookstores, and so on -- and actually
relinquishing that environment altogether -- ala E.M.
Forster's "The Machine Stops."

Computer-generated poetry would seem to be yet another path
to disempowerment and isolation. The absence of an author or
emotional content would seem to indicate that the
poet/programmer avoids the difficult work of examining their
own emotions and personal history. They cannot, in this
genre at least, "composed like them / Of Eros and of dust, /
Beleaguered by the same / Negation and despair, / Show an
affirming flame."

I write "would seem" because I really don't know. Surely
there are immensely prolix rationales for the form and its
importance. Anyone point to the manifestos?

Hmmm... First, the social tends to expand online at this point, and in
depth - just look at half-life or active blogs, etc. Second, why a
manifesto? In any case everything depends on what is meant by "computer-
generated." In the 70s I wrote a program for a TI59 calculator that
generated texts. Ok, but there was an associated vocabulary; by changing
the vocabulary, the meanings changed radically. So this was under my
control. I could also choose what I felt was worthwhile, "tune" the
program towards certain ends, etc. On the other hand, codework can be
about the interrelationship between intentionality and code/protocol;
texts can be partially derived, partially hand-hewn. This can speak
volumes. I'd suggest you look at the West Virginia University Zwiki (I
think the URL is www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/ptzwiki - in any case, you can
google it) for discussions of these things. - Alan

Really got to thank those who have responded to my
post  (publically and privately). Your genuine and
generous warmth is appreciated very, very much.
Suffering at moment trying to state what's here, here
experienced, and quite personally, I touch your feet
and then press humble hand to both my forehead and
heart.

"Better Read than Dead"
Kleine Knocked Musik fur Alan nichts Stephen Sondheim
(though i have also been known to write:  "The Dead See Scrawls")

I woke covered in words. Fell down the stairs and a sharp word cut into my
guts. A severe word has incapicitated my write side.  Alzhiemer's lessons
have lit her alley cat arise my memory; I hardly recognize a sewer.  The odd
pols sing in my fab doughmen's Thames, a hard line that Ad hears to be
crowing. When I cry two stanzas my legs call laps thunderly.  My eyes too
are bubbly. Ivan so deceased, Icon Hearts line walls, a Cross their ruin.
Time comes Aunt Lee's whetting hunger's tepid cloves. I tried to crawl a
sewer but cold hard liners peeked. Eifel on the floor and lost cons shift
nests and hide. The old batch room is covert with bugs. The arse pots
affront my eyes every pair.  I canned seasony ore. Held mead's cup. My
charms are tin things. My braying's a swell thing; the paying is adorabale.
My art's Beat Thing so past, it's Worst Thing. I canned {Drew} Brees. Time's
gaps sing for bread. Time out to go and con chips. Time too diseased to add
up. My art's sopped bleeding. Hits per minute. Timed Ed . . .

you can hear all this if you listen to the below:

Dear Friends of the Poetry Project,

I hope this finds you well as we approach the holiday season =AD here at the
Poetry Project we=B9ve been having a great autumn in terms of the quality of
our programs and overall attendance. The attendance has been particularly
strong (and this on the heels of increases each of the past two seasons),
and I thank everyone who has been coming for the support as well as the
various thoughtful responses to the work presented. We=B9ve been able to star=
t
a new magazine, produce more multi-media events, host readings by dozens of
new poets each year, and offer 2-4 extra workshop classes per year over the
past several years while maintaining our commitment to holding regular
two-reader events much of the time on Mondays and Wednesdays; the feeling
around the Project=B9s programming of late has been tremendously positive.

At the same time, the Poetry Project=B9s membership numbers are down and this
is a concern for us as we head towards 2007. Funding for the Poetry Project
comes from a variety of sources: membership, admissions, workshop tuitions,
newsletter ads, public grants, private grants, individual donations and
special fundraising events and sales. No single source is primarily
responsible for our income =AD public funds, for instance, annually represent
only a bit more income than membership.  The long and short of it is that
when one source is suffering we feel it, despite the fact that our office
and programming costs are kept to a minimum. Fixed costs such as rent and
insurance continue to rise each year nevertheless, and so our overall costs
rise as well.=20

We=B9re constantly working on increasing our income without placing the bulk
of the burden on our extended community, but at the moment the Poetry
Project could use some help. If you are not already a member of the Poetry
Project, please consider becoming one or, at least, taking out a $25
subscription to The Poetry Project Newsletter. If you=B9ve been a member in
recent years but have not renewed, please consider renewing. We have a
number of different membership levels, including an $85 supporting
membership that gets one in free to all of our regular events. For more
information, please visit the membership page on the Project=B9s website at
http://www.poetryproject.com/membership.php

At this time of year many people are looking to make year-end contributions=
,
and I respectfully ask that you consider the Poetry Project for such a
contribution if you=B9re in fact thinking along these lines. The Poetry
Project is a 501(c)3 non-profit and all donations are therefore
tax-deductible. We also have a number of artworks, books and recordings for
sale, and our catalogs can be viewed at:
http://www.poetryproject.com/artwork.php  and
http://www.poetryproject.com/books.php

The Poetry Project accepts most major credit cards, and checks can be made
payable to The Poetry Project and mailed to us at:

The Poetry Project
St. Mark=B9s Church
131 E. 10th Street
New York, NY 10003

Finally, another way to help the Project is by attending the 33rd Annual Ne=
w
Year=B9s Day Marathon Reading on January 1. The Marathon is our biggest annua=
l
fundraiser, with 140+ poets, musicians, dancers and artists performing from
2pm until some time past midnight. There are also books, food and drink
available all day for sale in the Parish Hall while the reading takes place
in the Sanctuary. It=B9s a great community event that is regularly attended b=
y
over 1,000 people, and we expect this year=B9s Marathon to be excellent =AD eac=
h
of the past three years we=B9ve added 15-25 new readers to the bill, and this
year is no different. Our events calendar lists many of the scheduled
performers and also has an updated December/January calendar posted:
http://www.poetryproject.com/calendar.php

I thank you for your time and consideration, and hope you have a good
Thanksgiving. Below you will find our normal e-mail blast with next week=B9s
events.

Yours,

Anselm Berrigan
Artistic Director

Years ago, on an abandoned farm in Gruyere, spirits rose.
The landscape was full of joy and community prospered.
Invisible, only the flowers and stones, grange and bird, could see them.
But that was sufficient, no? That was sufficient.

Thanks to Alan for posting the reference to the zwiki. You may want to

Hmmm... First, the social tends to expand online at this point, and in
depth - just look at half-life or active blogs, etc. Second, why a
manifesto? In any case everything depends on what is meant by "computer-

generated." In the 70s I wrote a program for a TI59 calculator that
generated texts. Ok, but there was an associated vocabulary; by changing

the vocabulary, the meanings changed radically. So this was under my
control. I could also choose what I felt was worthwhile, "tune" the
program towards certain ends, etc. On the other hand, codework can be
about the interrelationship between intentionality and code/protocol;
texts can be partially derived, partially hand-hewn. This can speak
volumes. I'd suggest you look at the West Virginia University Zwiki (I
think the URL is www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/ptzwiki - in any case, you can
google it) for discussions of these things. - Alan

very good robert
it makes a page poem into a performance poem, merely by the fact that all the content is shown at once, like a performance you don't know what is coming next.
is the software expensive?
there is another flash based program that animates words and lines, it is called swish.

also to achieve what you have done you can also use quicktime pro.
just open a .txt file in quicktime player and it makes a line by line animated slideshow of the whole text.
with a little code tweeking you can change background color text color and off set.

i have a piece at youtube you might like

Greetings all:

Should have sent this out a few weeks ago, but here you are. Sending this
out for the editor. Please send submissions to the e-mail address embedded
below and good luck. Thanks!


hom=C3=B4numos magazine: Avant-garde and experimental: literature, philosophy,
science.

Call to authors: submission for hom=C3=B4numos magazine
Third Issue
Deadline submission: 15 Decembre 2006 (re-writes and finals January 2007)
Theme: Infinity
Color: indigo=20
=20
Hom=C3=B4numos Mission
Open an outlet for intelligent, refined, artistic, experimental, daring,
non-confrontational writing. Focus on multiculturalism and multilingual.
Professionals and amateurs equally considered. The brain is an organ which
needs to be cultivated, to be fed. Hom=C3=B4numos encourages the authors to pus=
h
the limit of their fineness, flair, intelligence, and creativity. Content
fusion of cultures (east meets west etc) is a must. An annual publication i=
s
in the works, containing the best (hopefully all) works in its full length
(no word limitation). Hom=C3=B4numos magazine hopes to foster literacy in its
utmost light, making it accessible for all to write. Hence accessible for
all to read, albeit never giving into complacency. Hom=C3=B4numos is not an
information magazine. Therefore we cannot accept journalistic type stories.
The material chosen for print has an intemporal sense. So far, people from
nations all over the world including locals in China, have taken part in
hom=C3=B4numos.=20
=20
Content
MUST BE EXPERIMENTAL IN CONTENT OR LAYOUT. IN PROVOQUING THOUGHTS.
EXPERIMENTAL IS BY NO MEANS CONFRONTATIONAL NEITHER IS IT SENSATIONAL.THE
HIGHER SPHERES OF THOUHTS. FAR OUT. ACCUTE SENSITIVITY.
=20
Try to work the idea and deliver it to us as a rough. Works in progress
(including scribbled notes etc) are most welcome. Finish pieces are not as
thought stirring. Concentrate on LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY SCIENCE.

Will do: beautiful literature, thought stirring, avant-garde themes,
experimental written organization, word art, possibilities and novel ideas,
sensual, ground breaking theories, observation, discoveries, brainiac,
nerdy, eccentric, schizophrenic.

Will not do: political, slandering of parties, conspiracy theory, sexually
explicit, coming off drugs black cloud rambling, unauthorized reproduction,
the expatriate lost in China culture shock theme, journalism of mass.
=20
Written material:=20
-Short stories (facts, fictions)
-Poems and graphic word
-Essay and thesis (scheme and structure, manifesto, hypothesis, including
notes and project drafts)
-Philosophy (thoughts, ideas, insights)
-Lyrics, music composition
-Science (discoveries or hypothesis. Social science. Natural science.
Anthropology ethnology. Bio and mechanics. Economics. Politics of
betterments. Sustainable development and alternative energy. Cooking. A
thought, and a search for a proof. An installation and explanations. A
recipe. A map. A graph.)

Hi Richard. What a shocking story. All too familiar, I fear; though I
would be surprised if any academic got away with behaviour like that
here.

Thanks too for pointing me to the website - some wonderful poems there.

All the best

Alison

Last summer, after deep thought and consultation with
writers whose work is vital but whose work will not
appear on the Mainland, and in this publication, I
asked to have my own work removed from consideration
even after being offered an issue that was to include
an interview).

I have been a member of Beijing's writing community
for two years - and as Bob can attest, was there early
on to support readings at the Bookworm (was there on
day one). My ties to the city are strong - among
expats and natives. My friendships and acquaintances
include Xiaolu Guo (Village of Stone) who resides in
the UK, and filmmaker Wang Baomin (Sunflower). And in
April, I organized and sponsored the first reading of
its kind in the city - standing room only, almost
entirely a LOCAL audience (and many of my students
from Tsinghu University attended) - and extended an
invitation to Mr. Marcacci (and as he's an astute
observer of opportunities, he graciously came)
accompanied by his posse of devoted Subterraneans.

It is self-serving to support this publication, I
submit. It is anti-human rights (and not so much an
issue of murky freedom), perhaps racist, certainly, I
think, a kind of complicity - and there are a number
of writers - among them Tibetan writer Katse Tsering -
who can better and more acutely attest to what's
happening in PR China (and he fled, is coming to the
US soon).

To those interested in expanding their readership, and
not merely garnering stripes, I really suggest
considering Phil Rowland's wonderful NOON (Japan)and
publications out of Taiwan or Hong Kong.

Here is a poem (to appear in upcoming Pinstripe
Fedora) which illustrates my point:

Schadenfreude
In memory of Otto Dix

If pushing limb
through an eggshell
were easier—“Weeste noch?”

not entirely
more daunting, say—
“Sehr wirklich Leben,”

thousands of
daisy cutters, der
Selbstermörd (1000 lb/in2),

might’ve led one
to meadows, however
miniscule, of quiet.—

But looking on
long enough, “Nache
diese Platter dort.”—

one becomes
drowsy,—feels anemic.
“Relative,” he said,

“—to naught.”
No voice. Stilleben.
And all is graceful.

Sometimes, I just wish people would listen - or read,
better still. And I'm really opening myself up to
unpleasantries - attacks - but am consistent in my
support of what I think we understand - i.e., that we
are defenders of the human experience. I won't say
anything more about this, as I feel, somewhat, like
I'm covered in urine.

I guess the slogan "the experimental is by no means confrontational"
and the not doing "political" or "slanderous" work are a bit of a give
away (is this some kind of Trojan Horse avant garde?) But all that
refined thought might give you a headache, anyway...

All the best

BOOK LAUNCH PARTY & READING

for

John High's

TALKING GOD'S RADIO SHOW

(a new novel from Spuyten Duyvil)

Friday December 1    6 PM
Biscuit BBQ (formerly Night and Day Restaurant) in the Skylight Room
230 Fifth Avenue at the corner of President Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn
718 399-2162

The reading will be introduced by Albert Mobilio

"Soaked in night visions and pierced through by jagged memory, Talking
God's Radio Show tells that peculiarly American story in which, as
Faulkner once said, "The past isn't forgotten, it isn't even the past."
John High's Virginia backwaters call to mind the feral, hallucinogenic
American landscapes of Cormac McCarthy's Child of God, as well as
Faulkner's Sanctuary."
Albert Mobilio

"The red-light district of Richmond, Virginia in the mid-sixties is the
backdrop of Talking God's Radio Show and High is the ultimate time
traveller--recreating the arcane of a world that seems long gone but is
actually steeped in present day time. High's novel is airtight and
explosive and belongs on the same shelf as James Ellroy's My Dark
Places and Leslie Silko's Ceremony."
Lewis Warsh

This event is part of a new reading series sponsored by Long Island
University's Graduate Creative Writing Program.

By way of Thanksgiving greetings, a real event that probably
needs no further poeticization.


A convicted rapist wins the lottery in prison. When he gets
out of jail, he settles in an upscale neighborhood ... where
he is watched by a giant owl, its deep hoot sounding the
darkness in judgment.

Could you tell a bit more about this magazine.  I checked the website, which is in French (that's good for me), but there was not much more than the announcement below.  I suppose that I would like to know how this magazine which is distributed in China exclusively, it seems, came about, besides knowing that the founder is Christine Bellerose, alias Cricri, queen of erotica. . . .

  Greetings all:

Should have sent this out a few weeks ago, but here you are. Sending this
out for the editor. Please send submissions to the e-mail address embedded
below and good luck. Thanks!


homÃ´numos magazine: Avant-garde and experimental: literature, philosophy,
science.

Call to authors: submission for homÃ´numos magazine
Third Issue
Deadline submission: 15 Decembre 2006 (re-writes and finals January 2007)
Theme: Infinity
Color: indigo

HomÃ´numos Mission
Open an outlet for intelligent, refined, artistic, experimental, daring,
non-confrontational writing. Focus on multiculturalism and multilingual.
Professionals and amateurs equally considered. The brain is an organ which
needs to be cultivated, to be fed. HomÃ´numos encourages the authors to push
the limit of their fineness, flair, intelligence, and creativity. Content
fusion of cultures (east meets west etc) is a must. An annual publication is
in the works, containing the best (hopefully all) works in its full length
(no word limitation). HomÃ´numos magazine hopes to foster literacy in its
utmost light, making it accessible for all to write. Hence accessible for
all to read, albeit never giving into complacency. HomÃ´numos is not an
information magazine. Therefore we cannot accept journalistic type stories.
The material chosen for print has an intemporal sense. So far, people from
nations all over the world including locals in China, have taken part in
homÃ´numos.

Content
MUST BE EXPERIMENTAL IN CONTENT OR LAYOUT. IN PROVOQUING THOUGHTS.
EXPERIMENTAL IS BY NO MEANS CONFRONTATIONAL NEITHER IS IT SENSATIONAL.THE
HIGHER SPHERES OF THOUHTS. FAR OUT. ACCUTE SENSITIVITY.

Try to work the idea and deliver it to us as a rough. Works in progress
(including scribbled notes etc) are most welcome. Finish pieces are not as
thought stirring. Concentrate on LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY SCIENCE.

Will do: beautiful literature, thought stirring, avant-garde themes,
experimental written organization, word art, possibilities and novel ideas,
sensual, ground breaking theories, observation, discoveries, brainiac,
nerdy, eccentric, schizophrenic.

Will not do: political, slandering of parties, conspiracy theory, sexually
explicit, coming off drugs black cloud rambling, unauthorized reproduction,
the expatriate lost in China culture shock theme, journalism of mass.

Written material:
-Short stories (facts, fictions)
-Poems and graphic word
-Essay and thesis (scheme and structure, manifesto, hypothesis, including
notes and project drafts)
-Philosophy (thoughts, ideas, insights)
-Lyrics, music composition
-Science (discoveries or hypothesis. Social science. Natural science.
Anthropology ethnology. Bio and mechanics. Economics. Politics of
betterments. Sustainable development and alternative energy. Cooking. A
thought, and a search for a proof. An installation and explanations. A
recipe. A map. A graph.)

"The world is not for everyone to understand. Not understanding everything

Yes. it's shocking & stupid. Niloufar Talebi is a friend & she does
erxcellent & honest work. Her enthusiasm & energy are spectacular. Of
course some academics are (for any number of reasons) unable to
follow her energy or back her. But that's the same for any number of
poetry projects that freak out academia. Niloufar will keep trucking
& doing her thing & we will keep supporting her.

This is really sad; Parachute has been consistently one of the best
art magazines in the world. (I wrote for them and knew Chantal a bit.)
And the saddest part is - venues like this take so little to run.

What on earth is happening to the $100,000,000,000,000,000,000 that
Poetry magazine received? At least I think they dad.

Damn.

First Ruth Brown, and now Robert Jr. Lockwood.  Lockwood died Tuesday evening at age 91.  He was our last direct link back to Robert Johnson, and just about the only person to play Johnson's Delta style on the twelve string guitar. I first met Lockwood when he used to appear at the Smithsonian Folk Festival and I was a kid hanging around the musicians trying to see how they worked their wonders.  My last visit with him was here at Penn State when he appeared just a couple years ago.

It's Thanksgiving and that means we have another menu poem for you to enjoy!
This year our guest of honor is John Ashbery. This is a series of poems
based loosely around a menu of the meal I would cook for you should you come
to my home for Thanksgiving. Since it's impossible for you to come, I offer
these simple poems for warmth. This is free and in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.
This was written during a power outage so the main course is a longish hand
written piece. Also included are 3 of my most requested recipes.
Enjoy, Geoffrey


Thanksgiving 2006: a feast to honor John Ashbery, by Geoffrey Gatza is part
of an annual thanksgiving poem series. This is the fifth installment in that
series which include menu poems for:

Thanksgiving Poems : Five years of feasts! Honoring Charles Bernstein,
Forrest Gander, Kent Johnson, Robert Creeley & John Ashbery

Thanksgiving is not at all like Saturnalia. In America, the third Thursday
is reserved to celebrate the giving of thanks. The thanks for all that we
are, what we have, those who have graced our lives, and so on. This is also
a bloody marking of the genocide performed to gain this land. One must never
forget what died to feed.

Innocuous enough, Thanksgiving is the most appropriate means to hold this
kind of thing. That thing is an odd blending of cooking and poetry. I am a
chef in my day job and how I come to understand art is through this first
love. Cuisine has a natural ease to bring out many complex ideas, as cooking
brings out complexities from seemingly simple foods. And a dinner party,
virtual or not, [ read more ]

Hey all.  I didn't realize there were so many people from Minnesota on this
list!

So while we're on the subject of goings on in Minnesota, I wanted to let you
all know that I am currently running a reading series at the Coffee Gallery
in Minneapolis.  We have an open mic the second Sunday of each month and
featured readers the last Sunday.  So this Sunday, the 26th, we have two
poets-Steve Mueske and Chris Pommier.  You can see their bios and some
sample works at http://www.myspace.com/prismpoetry.  The reading is
1:00-3:00 pm.  The Coffee Gallery is now located in the Open Book Center at
1011 Washington Avenue.

In December, we're doing two open mics:  December 10th and the 31st.  The
one on the 31st is roughly organized around New Year's Resolutions/Old Year
Reflections.  Again, 1:00.

Readings are free and open to all.

Cheers.

Hey all:

Should you be interested, Dan was kind enough to post
some portraits taken while most recently in India. If
you're not familiar with Dan Bradley and fhole, please
do become familiar with both he and his many important
contributions to our creative community.

This portraits were taken in North India, Himachal
Pradesh.

In Chicago if you want to find great poetry readings I would go to
goldenrulejones.blogspot.com and to mysite Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com;
Chicagopoetry.com is a site violently opposed to experimental writing--

Subject:      THANKSGIVING DAY FAST FOR PEACE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A few days ago I decided that there was no way I was going to join in
the celebration of Thanksgiving Day as I have every year of my life in
the past. In fact, when I started thinking of celebrating Thanksgiving
the past three years I thought, "What was wrong with me!?" All these
people being killed in Iraq and elsewhere because of America,
why why why, why should we be celebrating a day of thanks?

Maybe  it's good to alter how it's celebrated, being with family, being
grateful for family, etc., but from its infancy, the holiday was centered
on celebrating early American arrival, which of course turned out to
REALLY BE an invasion, an occupation, and slaughter. Sort of like  Iraq.

If we're not out of Iraq next year I want to start spreading the  word of a
THANKSGIVING DAY FAST FOR PEACE. Especially since the day is
traditionally a day of eating as much food as humanly possible in one
sitting.

And also, let me say, I've never fasted before today. Isn't that  weird?
Everyone I talk to says they can't believe it. But even when I was
macrobiotic for ten years I never fasted. But this fast is a personal
political protest. And maybe if I had thought about it sooner I could
have included others in the day with me. My family is really pissed
off. Oh well.

Tom Raworth liked my idea of the fast, wishing me,  "Non appetit!"
and suggested that maybe we should all have a SHIT-IN, where
we send bags of our Thanksgiving Day shit in plastic bags to the
White House. HEHEHE!

I second this; I just want to add that a turkey-free Thanksgiving is a
blessing - look at the Farm Sanctuary or PETA websites to see exactly how
your meals are raised. (We've been discussing this on the Cybermind list.)

Alan and Chris, glad you like the idea.  And yes the senseless
killing of the turkey.

I've been a vegetarian since 1988, and it was NOT for animal
rights at the time, but today it is animal rights that keeps me
a vegetarian.

BUT LET ME SAY THIS before I get SLAMMED with all kinds of
e-mails that I'm NOT interested in arguing WHY it's good to eat
meat, which always comes up.  Over and over it comes up.

What I will say instead is that I'm working on a pamphlet,
inspired by friends who eat meat but feel guilty about it.

Guilty in the sense of REALIZING the amount of resources,
from plant, electric, fossil fuel, etc., it takes to produce,
ship, store, freeze, etc., animal products.  For people who
want to make difference, WANT TO not be quite as harmful
to the environment from their end, but don't want to give
up eating meat all at once, here's something:

If you were to consume animal products (meat, eggs, cheese,
milk, honey, etc.,) only 6 days a week instead of 7, you would,
on average, free up roughly 16 pounds of plant matter a week
for the world, as well as many MANY watts of electricity, and
gallons and gallons of gasoline, etc..

Keep multiplying it, 5 days instead of 7, etc..

I have friends who liked this idea, SAW what I meant about
how THEY TOO can help out by cutting back, and some of
those friends have gone from 7 days a week to just 2 or 3.

While I am NEVER going to consume meat again for the
rest of my life, I realize it's easier to ask people to meet me
halfway on the issue.  And not only easier, but better for the
planet, the animals on it, and everyone everywhere in the end.

As ad hoc list contrarian, I urge everyone to gorge for war.
Eat only endangered species. Cook them in an unhealthy,
energy-intensive way. Spit out the bones and smite your
foes. Eat your foes if necessary. Leave a vast pyramid of
your foes' bones as a warning to others. Give the pyramid of
bones a cutesy name like "Boopsy."

Excuse me for existing? I think not. Make a really big,
sloppy, careless, and inconsiderate footprint in the world.
People will either get over it or they won't. If they don't,
screw 'em.

That said, I can resume my fast.

Relishing the contradictions with imaginary pumpkin pie,
Eric

I don't know if this will go through... We eat largely vegan here in=20
Brooklyn. I have a messed-up metabolism in general, and feel healthier
than ever in terms of food; I have more energy, etc. For me there are
several reasons - first, for me, no cholesterol (mine tends to go high)
and animal fats; second, the energy/production issue you point out;
third, the desire for the smallest ecological footprint as possible;
and fourth, most important, I don't ever ever want to participate in
the suffering of an animal ever again. It's not McDonald's farm at this
point, not even for "organic" or "free range." It's cut-throat and
cruel, especially since recent research has pointed toward the intelli-=20
gence of cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and so forth. When I was young
"bird-brain" was a derogatory term; now the anatomy of bird's brains is
being withdrawn as it's evident that their calls are often speech, and
they're capable of recursive phrasing - something it was thought only
humans can do. I could go on and on but you get the idea.

Apologies here, and sometimes I do backslide, but less and less -

- Alan

choosing to fast on the day many like to feast, and in the name of peace,
(and that if the war not over next year as conrad says)--
an admirable sentiment when you have enough to eat without worrying every
other day of the year about where your three squares or even one is going to
come from-

there are more and more hungry people daily in the usa--and thanksgiving a
day when people remember this and contribute food, cooking, cleaning,
serving, collecting cans and vouchers for stores to distribute to the hungry
at meals in all sorts of locations in communities of all sizes across the
country--

while you are fasting for a day from a meal/tradition  that repulses you and
is a day off from a year long healthy daily diet--
why not help make it a good feast day for people who really are hungry and
enjoy & appreciate the holiday and could use al the bags of goods and food
vouchers, etc you can raise for them--

and then maybe not do this just one day a year but more often--

here in milwaukee for example Food Not Bombs serves organic hot meals with
bag of fruit and other extras to go every Saturday--(at St John's Cathedral
where mid-day meal served every other day of week also)-- cooked, served and
cleaned up afterwards by FNB volunteers and volunteers from local
highschools--
there are meals that need to be cooked served and cleaned up after one-three
times a day in great great many locations  every day of the year that could
use your help--

some people can choose to fast when they please and announce it in public--
for a very great many a fast isn't a choice and it goes without saying--

while you choose not to eat from available abundance, why not help those who
would like to eat--
from hunger-

the war in iraq is also a war on the american people--the money poured into
the war comes out of the pockets and lives and mouths of the people here--

and that includes the families of the soliders in iraq--the city of san
diego has a permanent food and clothing and medical drive on for the spouses
and children of soliders in iraq--their pay and family benefits are not
enough to feed and support their families--
they too go to the free meals--

the war is not somewhere else only--it is right here too--

*"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night." --
Marguerite Duras *

Bad Momma blames Bad Warrior for her own boo-boos. Bad
Warrior gets psychic boo-boo later sublimated as
narcissistic fall-down-go-boom. This is bad "for the
planet, the animals on it, and everyone everywhere in the

  Columbus is the second largest midwestern city

there is at least one sizable poetry reading a week to attend, thirty some readings a year happen at the series I curate, Larry's Poetry Forum, the oldest in the state. In the past few weeks Jim Harms, Martha Collins, Steve Davenport, Chad Prevost, Gaylord Brewer have been visiting readers. Various universities have readings and there are also two slam venues that  bring in substantial (what I would consider unusually excellent choices for the venue in compares to other cities I've lived) readers including Saul Williams and Amiri Baraka.

  A decent number of the readings are listed under puddinghouse.com under the Poetry calendar but it is not comprehensive, at most a third of the readings are listed. I missed the original thread, not sure what else you were asking for--


Be well

and I forgot to mention before my two favorite (used) bookstores around =
these parts --=20


in Milwaukee:=20

Renaissance Books

[Renaissance Books -- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Renaissance Books is a large independent bookstore in downtown =
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Founded in the early 1960s by George John and =
Erwin Just, it is now owned by Robert John, George's younger brother. =
Renaissance also operates a branch at Milwaukee's General Mitchell =
International Airport, which when opened in 1979 is believed to have =
been the world's first used book store in an airport.]

as the Wikipedia entry sez, their mother ship is in the downtown area: =
by itself, the airport store is colossal and vast, and what they have =
there is a fraction of the volume they have at the downtown site. don't =
have the address on me, but someone from Milwaukee can probably fill =
that detail in...

this place is for serious bookmongers -- nothing clean or pretty about =
the joint.=20

---

in Duluth:=20

[??]
206 E. Superior St.

The name has changed a few times (owing to bankruptcies, repossessions, =
the usual ugliness), but this is a hulk of a bookstore right on Duluth's =
main drag -- as with Renaissance, it's a "full-body blow" book =
experience, but if book hunting is your sport, this is the place on the =
North Shore of Superior.=20

Hey, actually, at ZINC BAR I was talking about eating macrobiotic
on the days I was writing my "DEVIANT you, DEVIANT me" project
because it's one shot in the back of a book, no edits.  So the idea
was the eat as clean as possible to keep my head and hand steady.
Diet is something I think about a lot when it comes to writing.

HEY Alan, and David.  First, yeah I hear what you're saying about
FOOD NOT BOMBS.  And I'm not making excuses, but I'm fucking
BEAT, MY ASS IS BEAT!  I WORK like a dog and still can't pay my
fucking rent.  It's ridiculous.  I hate what's happening to
Philadelphia!

Of America's 10 largest cities, Philadelphia ranks highest in poverty.
In fact 1 in 4 people here are below the poverty line.  It's FUCKING
TOUGH TO GET BY HERE!  I don't know how people with kids can
even do it at all.  I'm tired tired tired tired tired of working so many
fucking hours, my ass is dragging.

I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR IN PHILADELPHIA THOUGH!  OH YES I AM!
AND POVERTY IS THE FIRST OF MY 9 POINT PLATFORM TO BE ADDRESSED!

Most likely I won't win, BUT I INTEND TO SHOW UP TO DEBATES
AND PLAY A KAZOO AS LOUD AS I CAN AND HAND OUT PAMPHLETS
ABOUT THE SUFFERING GOING ON IN TOWN!  I'll be playing a kazoo
by the way because they won't allow me to participate in debates, OF
THAT
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN!

To educate as many of my fellow Philadelphians as possible is
the goal.

But the animals,
  yeah, I'm not even believing the way we treat animals some days. Makes
me crazy.

  Animals have NEVER been treated the way they get treated here in
America.
  There are factory farms where pigs are a dozen generations DEEP into
NONE OF
THEM having ever stepped outside in the sunlight, in the rain.

To feel the grass is a luxury.

  I'm not against people eating meat (even though I choose NEVER to eat
meat
  again myself), but I really do wish people would look hard at how the
animals
they're eating have been treated before eating them.

  If everyone started JUST eating free range meats, that alone would
change the
  world overnight for a lot of animals. Suffering is something we can
all work
at ending together. There's no need for all this suffering.

  For ten years I was macrobiotic, and those were the healthiest, most
amazing
  years, let me tell you. I felt SO GOOD! No meat, no sugar, no booze,
no pills,
  and I felt high all day long, everyday, JUST FROM THE RICHNESS OF miso
and
carrots and rice, and I'm not making this shit up, it was THAT AMAZING!

Sex is so much more intense when your body is CLEAN AND FREE.

Depression disappears once processed foods and sugars are cut, at least
  that was the case with me. I had been on doses of Lithium, and just
about
  ready to LOSE MY MIND until macrobiotics came into my life. Now that
I'm
  a vegetarian I know that ONLY this stupid fucking WAR IN IRAQ can make
me
lose my mind!

I LOVE this fucking planet! There's so much to do! And we can make the
changes we need to make to get it back on track, I BELIEVE THAT! And
make
space for everyone to have their feelings about it, like Eric, who
really just
needs a cuddle. Right Eric dear? HEHEHEHEHEHEHE!

  I don't know if this will go through... We eat largely vegan here in
Brooklyn. I have a messed-up metabolism in general, and feel healthier
than ever in terms of food; I have more energy, etc. For me there are
  several reasons - first, for me, no cholesterol (mine tends to go
high)
and animal fats; second, the energy/production issue you point out;
third, the desire for the smallest ecological footprint as possible;
and fourth, most important, I don't ever ever want to participate in
  the suffering of an animal ever again. It's not McDonald's farm at
this
point, not even for "organic" or "free range." It's cut-throat and
  cruel, especially since recent research has pointed toward the
intelli- gence of cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and so forth. When I
was young
  "bird-brain" was a derogatory term; now the anatomy of bird's brains
is
being withdrawn as it's evident that their calls are often speech, and
they're capable of recursive phrasing - something it was thought only
humans can do. I could go on and on but you get the idea.

Apologies here, and sometimes I do backslide, but less and less -

Want

		(said: "Bloom
where it may bloom.")

	here
	from the gate

to place (all
love flourishing)

skirt bunched
hem towards
the knee
moving
slightly folded to
your right

(and a

belly up
tail mov

a bouquet of nasty pheromones

to slow
one’s speech
till only left
to listen to
most primal

“Everything you do with your hands.”

	off-pitch
thoughts
	 	that


	teeny-weenie door—	 		“If you were the Devil,” said
	“I’d take you…my mouth wide open.”

	to strum (six nails pounded—fixed into head stalk) an
alchemy as in painting

...
the rest is a secret!

Fond du Lac parents want controversial book out of
class

Angelou account of rape stirs objections

The Associated Press

FOND DU LAC — Some Fond du Lac parents have asked
school officials to remove former U.S. poet laureate
Maya Angelou's autobiography from the high school
curriculum.

Students at Fond du Lac High School read "I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings" in sophomore advanced English
classes.

But some parents have objected to passages that
describe Angelou's rape and subsequent unwanted
pregnancy. About 80 people attended a meeting Tuesday
at the school this week to discuss the book and the
request to remove it.

School Superintendent Gregory Maass said the initial
complaint came from one family.

"We had a mother and father and student who questioned
the book," he said. "The high school provided the
student with an alternative book."

The parents were not satisfied and asked for the book
to be removed from the curriculum, Maass said.

Fond du Lac High School Principal Mary Fran Merwin
said parents, teachers, principals and at least two
ministers spoke at the meeting, where no decision was
made. She said the school has used the book for a
decade.

"It is Angelou's own account of growing up," Merwin
said. "It has a number of attributes, and it's a
historically relevant story about a black woman
growing up in the United States."

School board president Gary Sharpe said the request
was the first to remove a book in his eight years on
the board. A school committee will make a decision on
the book, and if parents remain unhappy, they can
appeal to the superintendent and school board, he
said.

y'know, i really didn't like that book, and I don't enjoy Maya Angelou's poetry, but part of being in school is reading bad books that other people
think you should read, so that's not an issue. what's stupid is for parents to think that any of the stuff that goes on in that book is news to a
sixteen year old high school sophomore.

I know that some on this list have been keeping up to date on our struggle
to save artists spaces in downtown Tucson, including the space occupied by
Chax Press.

There's a poll today at the site of one of the local newspapers, the Tucson
Citizens. There are three choices: either you think artists are the
lifeblood of downtown Tucson, or you think they are leeches seeking a free
handout, or you don't ever go downtown & don't know. Please go there and
select the choice in favor of the artists, even though the whole poll,
choices, etc., are truly stupid.

It's at  http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/daily/local/33755.php

Thank you!

Dear Poetics List Members:

A recent post mentioning a news item that the book "I Know Why The Caged
Bird Sings" by Maya Angelou is facing removal from curriculum at a school,
resulted in responses on this list which I do not know how to describe in any
language.

How do I feel about censorship ?
I am opposed to censorship that serves to erase facts, events, ideas, one
woman's specific truthful experience from being told, reported, shared with the
people she chose to share them with.

How do I feel about rape ?
I have not been raped. I know more than one woman who has been raped.

When did I learn about rape ?
When a woman was raped in New Bedford Massachusetts and the trial of the
rapists (those who raped her and those who watched and did nothing) was
broadcast live from the courtroom on CNN. I watched this on TV.

When did I first read a story about rape ?
I can't remember reading any story about rape in high school or junior high
school. I know we read the poem "The Rape of the Locke" so the word was
introduced.

When did I next hear a story about rape in my hometown and  or local
neighborhood ?
I learned from my best friend from graduate school that she was moving  out
of her walkup apartment on East 69th Street and 1st Avenue in NYC, because a
man had climbed up the fire escape and raped a woman in the apartment  above
her. The Upper Eastside rapist was something locals knew about  because we would
see paper posters saying wanted with pictures of a hooded man  on signposts
occasionally. I learned of the time lag between what I knew and  when the
public knew. I remember being angry and shocked about this lack of  public
information. As I recall no television or radio station warned the  public that there
was a serial rapist on the Upper Eastside who was not  apprehended. I don't
know if he ever was.
On a hike in the woods I learned that my junior high school gym teacher had
been convicted of raping female students over a period of  many years. I
learned that the school principal a man I knew had  covered this up. One woman came
forward and told investigators her story and  then others came forward. These
women attended junior high school at the same  time as me in a small town.

I remember crying now thinking if only some parent friend teacher doctor
police officer clergy had listened to one of these women earlier, would the
other women not have been raped. I remember being disgusted and sickened at the
thought of this man in a position of trust. What he did. And how the school
administration knew about it and covered it up.

I hear stories about rape on a local and national scale. I hear stories
about rape in person at poetry readings and in the news.

What am I doing to create a world where women or men are able to share
painful experiences on their own terms as a way to bring criminals to justice,  or
simply express themselves openly and fully ?

I attend and listen. And listen beyond the listening. And sense.
May I be the person who stands up and loudly declares "yes, your story must
be told" or softly says "yes, I believe you have been hurt" and quietly asks
you now "what can I do to help ?"

These are the only moments that matter to me because I would like to  prevent
the hurts that are preventable.

Reading about rape in a book, hearing about it on TV, does that prepare a
child to turn to an adult and say "yes, that happened is happening to me."  ?

And if it does, am I are you prepared to listen and act.

Nathaniel A. Siegel

It's also absolutely outrageous that the book would be removed. We're
living obviously in a culture of victimization where children have to be
protected against everything all the time; only by coccooning will they
become functional adults. And of course to know, to understand, what rape
means also implies having some idea of sexuality, and that's forbidden.

This hear no evil so no evil approach goes a long way - no bodies
televised from Iraq, ignorance and denial of the effects of global
warming, an anti-scientism that's running rampant, and so forth.

I've also known women who have been raped - and without any indication of
what that means, how on earth are we preparing children? Even a lot of
adults think it's no big thing.

As is a world in which a man's authority over a woman's body might be
questioned. God forbid, as it were, we should have a world in which a
woman refuses her husband, or eek! has an abortion because she judges it
necessary to her own circumstances.

As I've known men who have been raped, although far fewer of you are in
the club -- this is one of those secret societies nobody wants to join,
but whose membership, one finds out, is numerous. We prepare children to
perpetuate this system with a casual discourse in which a college student,
bemoaning the purchase of this semester's expensive textbooks, says that
this purchase "raped" his bank account, and in which the implication of
prison rape is treated as comedy gold.

The New York based Koja Press has recently released 9 UNDERWOR(L)D 0 -
the fifth volume of poetry and poetics by William James Austin. The
poems provide a powerful climax to the poet's Dantescan vision of New
York City's underground existence. Likewise, the 'subtexts' conclude
VISIONISM, Austin's uniquely effective aesthetic.

My vote is in, Charles. I encourage others to take a second here, or, even
leave a comment, too.

Good luck here, Charles,  well, it's probably not luck, but hard work,
pushing back.
Even tho San Francisco here does everything - it seems - to make it
impossible for any artist/poet over 30 to live here - every weekend
thousands upon thousands come over the bridges, by public transport, by
plane, by clairvoyance, howtever, to rub faces with some aspect of 'live
culture' -poetry readings included. Suburban life  (DVD's and 'digital
culture') still don't quite cut the need for onsite auras with people

and,I suspect, many of us, too.

Thanks, mIEKAL

Now I know that, for the next five scheduled Chax Press books,

         two have titles that have 22.9% chances of being best sellers
         one has a title that has a 59.3% chance of being a best seller
         two have titles that have 69% chances of being best sellers

Oddly, if one of the 22.9% chance titles is considered as a literal phrase
rather than a figurative phrase, its chances drop to 8.3%.

The titles with the best chances combine a single concrete noun with a
single concrete adjective.

Hi
Anyone out there interested in the 60s-70s-early-80s writer Richard =
Brautigan? Be great to hear from you, swap info etc. I'm doing a PhD on =
him.In particular, where can you get sales figures for his books (or any =
others, come to that)? Is there some central resource or do I just have =
to pester the various publishers and hope they've kept records and will =
release them?

Why not try cross-fertilizing two nouns into a 'pro'noun - thereby upsizing
the  opportunity for a title's extended shelf-life - Tender Buttons into
endurable, restockable ones, para exemplar.

Ironically enough there is a guy up our street who collects books from
garage sales, antique shops, etc. His focus is North American anthropology
so he sells the other titles and uses the money to trade up for the
expensive anthro ones. However, books that he figures he cannot sell, he
puts out on the sidewalk. I have gotten things a first paper edition
Grotowski's Towards a Poor Theater, early ND paper backs of WCW, etc. This
past weekend I picked up a somewhat bent first edition, 1972, paperback of =
a
Simon & Schuster edition, (A Touchstone Book) of Richard Brautigan's short
stories, Revenge of the Lawn.  (171 pages)
Beautifully designed and typeset by Grabhorn-Hoyem (one of the leading shop=
s
in San Francisco of the time), it's sporadically, the stories (many of them
'micro' one or two pages long) are many a great read. He has a wonderfully
playful, surreal sense about him - particularly his gothic stories of rural
life in Washington (where he grew up dirt poor) - but then he also captures
San Francisco in the 1960's with oft a nice touch.

Interesting to me was that this book sold for $1.95 in 1971. Something
comparable in size (with shabby design and over inked printing) would now
sell for between $12.95 and $15.95. That's 35 years ago. Retail prices have
gone up 700 to 800 percent in that time!  And for comparable design/type
quality you have to buy Knopf in cloth at $25 to $35. It would be
interesting to know what prices - pushed way up by corporate control of
publishing houses and corollary demand for  profit margins - what those
forces have done to the demographics of who reads books and 'who don=B9t' buy
and read as much anymore.

But back to Brautigan - Trout Fishing in America remains a great read. In a
funny way he should be read side by side with Raymond Carver - particularly
the northwest, dark edge stuff.

Ironically, along with own inner-demons, Brautigan's enourmous fame and
popular success really blew him apart before he blew himself apart.

Good luck with your project.

so he sells the other titles and uses the money to trade up for the
expensive anthro ones. However, books that he figures he cannot sell, he
puts out on the sidewalk. I have gotten things a first paper edition
Grotowski's Towards a Poor Theater, early ND paper backs of WCW, etc. This
past weekend I picked up a somewhat bent first edition, 1972, paperback of a
Simon & Schuster edition, (A Touchstone Book) of Richard Brautigan's short
stories, Revenge of the Lawn.  (171 pages)
Beautifully designed and typeset by Grabhorn-Hoyem (one of the leading shops
in San Francisco of the time), it's sporadically, the stories (many of them
'micro' one or two pages long) are many a great read. He has a wonderfully
playful, surreal sense about him - particularly his gothic stories of rural
life in Washington (where he grew up dirt poor) - but then he also captures
San Francisco in the 1960's with oft a nice touch.

Interesting to me was that this book sold for $1.95 in 1971. Something
comparable in size (with shabby design and over inked printing) would now
sell for between $12.95 and $15.95. That's 35 years ago. Retail prices have
gone up 700 to 800 percent in that time!  And for comparable design/type
quality you have to buy Knopf in cloth at $25 to $35. It would be
interesting to know what prices - pushed way up by corporate control of
publishing houses and corollary demand for  profit margins - what those
forces have done to the demographics of who reads books and 'who don¹t' buy
and read as much anymore.

But back to Brautigan - Trout Fishing in America remains a great read. In a
funny way he should be read side by side with Raymond Carver - particularly
the northwest, dark edge stuff.

Ironically, along with own inner-demons, Brautigan's enourmous fame and
popular success really blew him apart before he blew himself apart.

Good luck with your project.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Heather Nagami & Alli Warren
Friday, December 1, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Heather Nagami joins us from North Carolina in celebration of her first book,
Hostile (Chax Press). Ron Silliman describes her writing as having “a goofball
elegance that has much to do with the New York School’s commitment to wit.”
Nagami’s poems have appeared in Antennae, Rattle, and Xcp (Cross-Cultural
Poetics). She is codirector of overhere Press, a small press that publishes
hand-bound chapbooks with an emphasis on poets of color and other
underrepresented peoples.

Alli Warren grew up in the San Fernando Valley. She is the author of the
chapbooks Schema, Yoke, and most recently, Hounds. On reading four lines from
Hounds, Jack Kimball writes, "A narrow, stodgy and often ostentatiously
learned, pedestrian, callow youth with an unpromising future, not a voracious
reader of fine literature, a painter without pictures, a radical without
followers, a bloviater on par with the windiest, incapable of getting to the
point, one who's cacography was really a mess"She has performed work recently
at the Artifact and New Yipes reading series, and every weekday at Small Press
Distribution in Berkeley. Her manuscript Cousins (The Roof Is On Fire) is new
from Snack Press.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall,
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the
intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

As many list members know, Sylvester Pollet recently brought to
completion his 100-installment chaplet series, Backwoods Broadsides.

This Thursday, 30 November, at 4:30pm in the Soderberg Auditorium on
the University of Maine campus in Orono, we'll celebrate Sylvester's
accomplishment with a reading by series contributors, including Tony
Brinkley, Kathleen Lignell Ellis, Theodore Enslin, Benjamin
Friedlander, Jennifer Moxley, and others. Sylvester will also read
and share some anecdotes from along the way.

More information about the event can be had here:

For driving directions, feel free to contact me at steve dot evans at
thirdfactory dot net or call the UMaine English department at
1-207-581-3822.

Contributors to the series who can't make the actual event are
invited to shoot me an e-mail with any words they'd like to have
included in the festivities. We'll do our best to work everything in.

Best wishes to all,

Steve

Just want to say here that this series has always been interesting and
inspiring and beautifully produced; I remember Diane di Prima in
particular (for some reason at the moment), but all the writing has been
great. And there's a wonderful intimacy about the format. Polleet should
be congratulated on the project which (at least for me) has been really
joyful.

Thanks, Alan

Dear J Tanner,
I am teaching Trout Fishing In America to a biggish class on "the literatures of San
Francisco" here at U of California at Santa Cruz, with selected poems too, in a context
of "beat beatitude" quest and seeing him as part of a Pacific Northwest contado to
SF with Snyder and Kerouac and Lew Welch.  I have been teaching him since the late 70s at U of
Hawaii where he also was a student favorite, a surrealist force of great wit and cunning
and sad life kind of the only hippie novelist of sorts.  Always interesting.  Counterpastoral US.

I do know for a fact that City Lights Bookstore press in SF turned down Trout Fishing In
America, to the later regret, as the Dell paperback sold a million of it.  But they
also turned down the early poems of Bob Dylan...

I had been a TA for Ron Loewinsohn at Cal Berkeley who was always so pround of that dedication to him and Spicer though he was not one of them as a writer as far as I could tell, a derivate diminishment and sadder...

anyway, good to hear you are working on RB as the criticism on him is pretty banal
in fact I have never found any writing on him that interesting...regards,
Rob Wilson

Wow, I remember reading Richard Brautigan and then being very saddened  by his suicide. I remember him as being a very non-mainstream writer,  very interesting. But that was so long ago. It is wonderful that  students are reading him  The Canon has certainly changed.

Deadline:  January 20 & May 20, 2007

We are inviting submissions of essays, poetry and short stories on the themes of Identity (Nationality, Citizenship etc.) and Cross Cultural experiences. We are also looking for interviews and collaborative works for our dialogue project (see below).

Please send submissions or questions to babel@icorn.org

BABEL In Dialogue

PEN Canada has published two chapbooks, each bringing together two writers from differing backgrounds in a dialogue about writing and literature, and the Winter issue of BABEL (www.icorn.org) features an excerpt of one:  Listen to the Reed. We are grateful to Karen Connelly, Fereshteh Molavi and PEN Canada for the permission for its inclusion.

We would very much like to continue bringing writers together in the spirit if the PEN Canada project. The discussions or email exchanges will be published in BABEL?s In Dialogue section four times a year. Our aim is to eventually collect these dialogues for a print anthology.

BABEL?s editors are currently working to introduce the webzine for school use in the UK and internationally, and we will be cooperating with NANCA (the North American Network of Cities of Asylum) and their print magazine in the future. In our first 4 months online we have averaged between 2,000 and 3,000 hits a month?without the benefit of advertising nor active promotion for the website. We expect the webzine to be a visible portal for quality literature.

We hope that you will consider participating in this project, and especially welcome exiled and expatriate writers. Each dialogue will run between 2500 and 4000 words. If you are interested please send a short CV and bio to ren@icorn.org.

BABEL can provide a partner and kick-off question if desired; otherwise, we?re excited to see what everyone is talking about.

For more information please see About the Webzine http://www.icorn.org/sections.php?var=12

suggested exercises in Writing Down The Bones. Writers in all genres, ficti=

Dear Friends of Archipelago Books,

Please join Archipelago Books and Mark Polizzotti at 7 p.m. this
Thursday, November 30th, at the Harvard Co-op in Cambridge.

Mark Polizzotti will read from his new translation of Marguerite Duras'
"Yann Andrea Steiner," published this year by Archipelago Books.
Dedicated to Duras' companion with whom she spent the last decade of
her life, "Yann Andrea Steiner" is a haunting dance between two
parallel stories of love and solitude: the love between Duras and the
young Yann Andrea and a seaside romance observed--or imagined--by the
the narrator between a camp counselor and an orphaned camper, a
Holocaust survivor.

Mark Polizzotti has translated the work of Jean Echenoz, Gustave
Flaubert, Andre Breton, Christian Oster, in addition to Duras' novel,
"Writing" in 1998, and he is
currently director of publications at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston. He will be available for question and answer after the reading.

Happy reading this fall!

Hi all,
=20
Just offhand the question of the Boy Scout system came up. I made it to Cub=
 Scout and no further. Many of my successful "arty" friends are Eagle Scout=
s. A high percentage in fact.Informal survey, how many of us went through t=
he Boy Scout system? How far did you get?
=20
I don't know the equivalents for Brownies/Girl Scouts, but would like to be=
 informed and get similar involvement feedback.
=20
Thanks in advance,=20

 Wade of the homosexual issue.            I see myself as a public servant. One might say, a girlie man.
  I still do the same things.
  Can you tell me about the company and the line of products you represent?
  " We're talking about the bird flu, of course. The court is forcing San Francisco values on the whole country.
  ArenAt there real conversations to be had that donAt involve the words AenantiomericA or AhermeneuticsA?
  That's why it's called the common cold, right?
  I see myself as a public servant.
  Mister played pretty loose with their hermeneutics Would you consider running for the U.
  " to which McCain responded: "No. " We're talking about the bird flu, of course.
  And this is a debate worth happening.
  Would you consider running for the U. I see myself as a public servant.  One of the most important sections of the book, Mohler noted, is the  examination of Atrajectory hermeneuticsA now gaining popularity among  some evangelicals . It sure sounds like it. Let the states decide, huh?  Hermeneutics is the reason, he says, or interpretation; based on  differing experiences and knowledge, we interpret the Bible in our own  way. If you find this article interesting, be sure to also read  'Vitamins.

[please note: nikuko.blogspot.com is unable to be updated. google has taken
over blogger which went to beta software; i haven't been able to access the
site since. corresponding with google is useless; four letters only produced

real-life vignettes

I'm tired of these real-life vignettes, somewhat digitally manipulated, as
if there's a gross philosophical point to be made through the sound or
sight of the singer or dancer or walker: what foolery. Nausee, Sartre,
defuge, overwhelm me, and I'm sure if you are following video after video,
text after text, sound after sound, they overwhelm you as well. No amount
of philosophy, no quantity of poetics squeezed from the soul of the imag-
inary, can compensate for one minute of reality rehashed. As if it were
possible to hack the landscape, the mise en scene. In any case, there's
always the appeal to god, as in this instance, or the Pringy church yawps
- spirit makes everything come out well in the end, at least aesthetically
- at least for believers. And I mean: nothing can be farther from the
truth - which may also be modified: nothing can be farther than the truth
- isn't that always the case?

http://www.asondheim.org/chch.mov

All these vignettes involve real people and hard rock, mountains, forests,
villages cities, churches, granges, pastures, meadows, cliffs, glaciers,
bluffs, hills, streams, rivers, trees, goats, choughs, flowers, roads,
paths. And what with the whispering, there is that, the slightest sound
transcribed into pixel after pixel - an entire universe of pixels, of
which this, and this and that, are an infinitesimal part. We climbed down
the north tower of the cathedral in Geneva, rounded a pillar; in a
distance, a choir was singing. Here now the singing loops and transforms;
the image isolates madonna and magdalene, bracketing the right-hand side
of the screen. And that is all, the whole like the paste of spirit
perhaps, or the slight spew of afterbirth.

Subject:      Brautigan/Beatles Connection
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7Bit

The Richard brautigan album which appeared on Harvest records was originally slated to be part of a spoken word series on Apple that was to be produced by uber-hipster Barry Miles. I met Miles thru friends  a few years back and he said that after Apple collapsed before the series could be issued , the Beatles turned over the masters to him ( a rare act in record world). One by-product of the Beatles venture into poetry is the great Charles Olson recordings that eventually appeared (& are still availible) through Folkways. As a kid, remember the album being advertised in Rolling Stone. It featured Brautigan's phone number and the invitation for people to call him w/ the cavaet not to call at night as "calls at night are always about bad news' --them wuz the days!

I'm sorry that Brautigan is not taken seriously enough by lit arbiters for a collected poems -- odd that someone who was perhaps the most visible voice of SF scene in the 60s & 70s as his works were published by Dell is now only availible thru used bookdealers.

Thinking back, it is hard to imagine how popular he was -- I came across his work in high school & it seems that most of my cohorts in college (mid 70s) had read at least one of his books (it was also an era that gary Snyder --especially Earth Household & Turtle Island-- was a backapck essential, especially in the urban east coast, where many of us talked about escaping to someplace with trees in Northern california or the Pacific NW). Glad to see he still finds readers

I was a rather desultory scout -- As a child, I belonged to a troop
in Colorado marked by its informality and outlaw status -- I don't
think any of us had a complete uniform, mostly because our parents
couldn't afford but one item at a time -- still, we had a great time
crawling up  and down the mountains -- When my family moved to the DC
area I slowly drifted away from the whole program -- It didn't help
that one of our first outings as a troop into the Virginia hills
brought us to a gas station with a sign on the restroom door that
read "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone."  I stood in
front of that sign for several minutes trying to fathom what it could
mean till a nervous troop leader grabbed me, said "never mind," and
plopped me back in the car -- only to stop at another station one
mile down the road --

I did much better with the insignia of academia, but by then I was no
longer a tenderfoot, and by then I had learned a few things about the
racial politics of Lord Baden-Powell--

My younger brother, however, did make it to eagle and is still active
with scouting.

I made it to Life Scout, one below Eagle.  Two things kept me from the
highest rank, the Physical Fitness Merit Badge, and the "God & Country"
award.  I just couldn't be hypocritical enough to fake that last one.  If
I'd known about Buddhism back then, I might have been able to make it.

Hi all,

Just offhand the question of the Boy Scout system came up. I made it to Cub
Scout and no further. Many of my successful "arty" friends are Eagle Scouts.
A high percentage in fact.Informal survey, how many of us went through the
Boy Scout system? How far did you get?

I don't know the equivalents for Brownies/Girl Scouts, but would like to be
informed and get similar involvement feedback.

Thanks in advance,
David Harrison Horton

Also reminds me of Brautigan's 'Plant This Book' - which was a folder that
contained at least a half dozen flower seed packets. Printed by Graham
Macintosh (who was Spicer's cohort, printer and publisher of White Rabbit
books), each packet had a poem for the particular kind of flower.
Beautifully packaged and printed about 1969 or so (right in the middle of
'flower power' days) it is now a very expensive collector's item.  It was
given out free. I gave my set as a gift to my folks. When I went looking for
it in the family house a few years back, I learned that all the seeds had
been planted years ago, and nothing remained of 'the package.'
I guess that was 'flower power' to my folks - god bless them!
And those days of such counter-capital generosity, and reciprocal gifts,
etc! Brief as it was.

Dear friends,

  I’ll be reading from my new book, Occupational Treatment (Atelos, 2006) at two East Coast venues over the next two weekends, paired up with another wonderful poet on both occasions. If you’re in or near New York or Washington, DC, I’d love to see you there. Details below:

  New York – Saturday, December 2nd at 4pm
  Bowery Poetry Club
  308 Bowery @ Bleecker
  212-614-0505
  www.bowerypoetry.com

  I’ll be reading with Kristin Prevallet, whose new book, Shadow Evidence Intelligence, you owe it to yourself to read. She is also the author of the author of Perturbation, My Sister: A Study of Max Ernst’s Hundred Headless Women, and Scratch Sides: Poetry, Documentation and Image-Text Projects.



  Silver Spring, MD – Saturday, December 9th at 8pm
  Pyramid Atlantic Arts Center
  8230 Georgia Ave. (3 blocks from the Metro red line)
  (301) 608-9101
  www.pyramidatlanticartcenter.org (site has directions)

  I’ll be reading here with Maureen Thorson, who lives in Washington, DC, where she is a lawyer, when she is not making many many beautiful tiny books. Ugly Duckling published Novelty Act, and she is also the author of The Spectacle of Meat.

  Letterpress Broadsides of the poets (made in collaboration with printmaker Val Lucas of Pyramid Atlantic) will be available at the reading.

   Love,
  Taylor

my experience of scouting in rural northern California, ca. 1980, was
horrific and abusive -- seemed to be an organization whose aim was to
give high school lads with neo-fascist tendencies "fresh meat" to
practice on.=20

was there a badge called "Tenderfoot"? I think that's as far as I got
before I bailed out, with my father's blessing: the scoutmaster was also
the father of Scout Capo #1, the ringleader in a lot of the abuse -- no
way to convince this guy that institutionalized bullying wasn't just
"boys being boys."=20

sorry I have nothing positive to contribute here: the only Eagle Scouts
I knew of in Placer County were plain old wankers.=20

I got to Webelos in Cub Scouts and was getting ready to transition into the boy scouts right around the time there was that court case about the Boy Scouts of America not allowing atheists and gays to be scouts. I considered myself an atheist at the time and figured any organization with its head that far up its ass didn't deserve to have me as a member.

I really liked the camping trips and crafts and things i learned as a cub scout though, and I still remember a lot of the things I learned for my badges.

I enjoyed Cub Scouts (making little wooden boats for Regatta Races and
little wooden rockets for Rocket Races was fun) and my parents were
actually Webelos den parents. Then I went into Boy Scouts and it got
really ugly and weird in an after-school-special-ish kind of way. I
got into one of my only two serious boyhood fights at a Boy Scouts
meeting and I and the other kid were expelled from the ranks. Which
was fine with me because Boy Scouts met Wednesday nights and that's
when The Greatest American Hero was on TV.

-- well there was also making hot chocolate before dawn so we could watch
the sunrise from somewhere farther inside the park -- where the paths left
off and there were only sand dunes and weird stones

Subject:      Detroit - New Museum query.
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/arts/design/30urba.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5

Very interesting review of new contemporary art museum in Detroit in former
car dealership -  its guiding architectural principle is to incorporate the
historical remnants of the site's  "decay" / rather than to banish and
replace it with the converse of that. On paper it sounds good to me.

As resident poet in Detroit - who has written considerable on decay - it
will be interesting to get Barry Watten's response to it - either here or on
his blog site. Or any other folks living there, too.

(Analogically it's interesting to imagine 50 years from now, 'virtual
museum' sites will be built and situated on structural remains and product
detritus of eBay or Google, etc.)

 Which begs the question of what will be the ideal equivalent to a museum
site for contemporary poetry. Given the way text is being variously hit and
explored by x, y, and z mediums - and that might well be the norm of the
'new poem' - what hybrid model is going to contain all of these forms and
possibly redefine and replace the standard Norton 'canon' anthologies in the
process?
"Now class, drop your books, check the course password and go to the
Server."

If only I did not love reading well designed text on a page so much!!!

I attended a party for Brautigan c. 1969 at the Chenango apartments on
Buffalo's West Side, around the corner from my South Putnam Street
apartment.
The host, I think (does anyone remember this event?), asked everyone to
bring a gift
for RB. After rummaging through my treasures, I lugged over three things: an
old,
longish, dark wooden spool, a turn-and-a-half section of 1" diameter truck
spring,
and a 3" unmounted biconvex lens. I've wondered since whether he recognized
them
the next morning as a single gift, and what became of it/them. Given the
spring's
foreboding heft, he may have abandoned that helical leg of my triad, but he
might
have fashioned the spool into a joint clip or pulled the lens from his
pocket to burn
cryptic endearments into park benches. In memory, the spring surrounds the
spool,
both vertical; the lens, a hand away, orbits them, a moon in its various
phases, as if
I'd never given them away--or as if he'd arranged them that way,
posthumously
returning them. My turn again.

notify Dr. Mical or Robert Cheatham of your intent by February 15
2007 in order to be included in the release notification.

Article length is at your discretion. Experimental hypertexts are
especially welcome. Other forms of media, video, etc., may have
length restrictions, please cc media editor Chea Prince or technical
editor, Jim Demmers.

Hauntologies, or Spectral Space
Call for Submissions

This issue of Perforations asks for informed speculations in art,
literature, architecture, and aesthetics concerning the ethereal
others which are never quite present or absent : including uncanny
presences outside the frame of representation, anamorphic blurs of
concepts or images; leaking, stained, or spectral spaces,
disappearing figures or soluble identities; of all that sometimes
works like miasmas, pneumas, and vapors; and all possible
manifestations of specters (real or imaginary). This includes
speculative revenants of repetitions of all sort including
catastrophic trauma (the spectral delays/deferrals of Freudian
'nachtraglichkeit') as well as any embeddings of notions of 'eternal
return,' as having hauntological portent for communities and thought
to come.

In its entirety, the issue seeks to selectively map an ephemeral
cartography (a haunto-topography) of the range of barely discernible
ghosts, these "ontological specks" or "pathological kernels", that
traverse the instrumental Cartesian worldview of "clear and distinct"
entities. Authors are asked to chase and capture the multiple
potential meanings and effects of their favorite ontological spectre.
                                  -----------------------------------------

Formed in 1991 to examine issues of theory, art, culture and
community in a saturated age of technical media, Perforations is
perhaps the longest continuously running journal on-line.


The call for perforations 30, HUT TECH, will be released soon.

Brautigan was equally popularly on campus in Wisconsin in the 70's.  For a
while it was Brautigan, then for a while everyone was reading Bukowski. Or
maybe it was Buk, the Brautigan, I forget.

It makes me wonder...(I'm no longer at a U) who, if anyone, is everyone on
campus reading today.  I'd be interested in an astute analysis of the
authors filling that niche over the years.  Does one exist?

Joe Francis Doerr

I think this gentleman is one of the most relevant and
compelling voices in poetry today. For me, this what
I've been looking for - no smoke and mirrors, no slack
poetry designed to serve an otherwise incestuous
cliche of bad poetry mongers, to slight of hand that
leaves readers thinking they just came (but didn't).

Can anyone provide me with additional information,
because I've just stumbled upon his work. Back
channel. Where can I find him. Time, I will appreciate
it!

Now, to quickly elaborate - because sometimes I just
don't rest long enough to be thoughtful. There are
lots of poets and a myriad of styles and particular
poems by a number of people I admire - read often.

... [ written with invisible ink ]

It is just that I'd like to learn more about this
individual. It is not often, to be honest, perhaps
rare exceptions, that I read work that propels -
literally - me to reconsider the focus of my craft.

Stephen,

It seems your parents followed exactly the spirit of the books. I do not
think anybody thought they would become collectors' items one day -the very
reverse of the "Plant This Book," "Unplant This Book"- or cared.

Ciao,

When people begin to discuss sports as important here, it seems to me
we are arguing about a particular tree in a wood.

Yes of course money is taken from academic and other areas and poured
into sports, and in general sports are for boys.  At GMU I rejoice to
say we have no football team.  Repeatedly efforts are made to get one
and twice there has been a vote and it has been voted down. Students
do not get to participate in these votes.  The last time was a close
call.  The argument is made that football brings money; statistics
show the opposite.  What statistics show is football brings attention
("glory") and more students.  More students does not necessarily
generate the income in a public state-supported school; it's part of
it but the extra income brought in does not pay for the sports.  As
to individuals in sports, most of them end up with bad
injuries.  When I said I was against football in the school one day
in a classroom after GMU had some "win" which made the news, the
girls were as shocked as the boys.  They were more vociferous in
their support of the game in question.  Basketball. All boys.

And the examples from elementary school won't do either.  The change
occurs in junior high and it's not that girls suddenly stop studying.
Girls are usually more docile and the sort of thing that wins merit
in school is not what gets promotion outside. Girls will work, be
agreeable, and obey the teacher to her face and stay in
hierarchies.  They are apparently taught to from a young age.  But
girls switch from the science and math courses to humanities.  I
remember when I was in 11th grade I got a high grade on a regents
math exam; nonetheless, the teacher advised my father my strength was
not in math and I was encouraged to drop math and take another year
of French and more varied history. I liked that, but because of this
I still have no calculus.  I don't even know what it is.  At my
college (liberal arts) at the time there was no math requirement so I
took none (partly embarrassed that I had no calculus and from a two
year gap when I was young being bad at some arithmetical calculations
which I'm still bad at -- my younger daughter says it's a
psychological block, but never mind me personally, just I'm an
example of something).

I was around 14-15 when this advice was given.

The divide happens when sexuality emerges between boys and girls as a
divide.  What makes the internet hard for women is a function of
sexual mores as they translate or become social norms.  Willa Cather
has a passage in one of her novels where she says how the world is
transformed for a girl when she goes into puberty; boys too, but for
girls the transformation means you are at risk, in second place, and
everything around you reinforces that.

You may get kids into the classroom by encouraging boys "to go to
school for chicks" and by encouraging girls to be chicks
(cheerleaders) and glorifying sports (football is a particularly
aggressive one), but this is just all that supports war (ribbons for
example, intense competition in small male groups) and sexism by other
means.

As for downloading music, that's not building a computer, that's not
building a website (which my younger daughter did on her own -- to no
avail as when she went out the door of our house she confronted a
world where she hid that she had done that, never told anyone except
friends on her blog).  My older daughter downloads music and all
sorts of other commercially-rooted activities; she has a blog because
the blog-makers have made it easy (instructions are primary and most
of it ready-made -- and thus she has commercials on her blog).

Girls who come from more upper class parents are at an advantage
since they can be networked into better jobs through connections (go
to the right university) and money (her father may own a business and
can hire the young man or knows someone who can) and get "better
husbands" too (higher salaries, and the class divide encourages them
at least to hide brutality as "low" and not of their class).

Offlist someone quoted Gertrude Stein to me as an explanation for
what happens in the internet:  patriarchy is patriarchy is
patriarchy.  What we see on the internet is a mirror of our social
worlds, and sexism is stronger than it's been in decades.  It's as if
against the most recent feminist phase (1960s to 70s) because it was
openly argued that women should be freed sexually (this for the first
time ever; hitherto the argument rested on a manifestation  and
supporter of sexism, that women can't get good jobs for good money),
that the explosion to repress this became fierce.

People should read John Stuart Mill's _On the Subjection of women_.
Way back in the middle 19th century he said in non-dramatic, and
quiet prose that the group that is in charge (men) and particularly
through sexual possession and ego-pride is not going to give up its
control if it can help it.  He said it was fundamentally not class
but sex. A man's right to own and control (in order to be a father)
and have access to women on his own terms and a world made for this.

What we see in hard-copy publishing is what we see on the Net, in the
world of prostitution.  Different media and different terms, that's all.

Ellen

my work is perfect roundness


my work is perfect roundness
there's nowhere to break in
perfect music's soundless
silent in the din
of others' cries and speaking
always in the light
of bodies cursed and leaking
wounded in the night.
i cannot stomach answers
i cannot harbor talk
languages are cancers
speech an idle squawk
the tension in my style
nothing is at stake
i'm thinking all the while
for buried closure's sake
bones are made from flesh
flesh is made from bones
caught in indra's mesh
speaking monotones
i closed the doors to thought
and opened wide to life
whatever is, was sought
appearances are strife
i closed the world's thick door
i gathered meanings all
and always what's in store
has always been my pall
i lived inside my death
and died outside my work
my breath was dying breath
i died inside the murk
that struggled spoke in cant
said nothing left to say
said nothing left to rant
decoded my mainstay
what fell apart lay far away
what's nearer haunted me
i conquered near and far alway
what's near taunted me
what's far deserted me
in utter quietude
i circled circled me
my language hewn and rude
i cast away the spell
and burned symbolic core
dark days upon me fell
and night upon me bore -
"my work is perfect roundness
i see within the night
i hear in perfect silence
i die within the light" -
so do not speak o stranger
o gods stay stock and still
i never was in danger
of thought i've had my fill
i worked my way through column
language text and poem
theory hard and solemn
allowed me in its home
theory cold and wondered
brought me to an end
from earth i am asundered
there's no way left to wend
there's nothing left to send
from earth i was and thundered
from death-life i did fend
from life-death nothing pondered
and this was what i penned
and this was vowed and written
and like a missive kenned
and sealed and forgotten
and brought once more to bend
against all conversation
against discussion's play
without equivocation
that closes down the way

-- i'm not sure what relevance this post has to *this* list -- and i think
it's a matter of biological essentialism to insist that women speak to
gender theory because they have the requisite bodily organs -- men are
stereotyped by gender every bit as heavily as women are -- and frankly, with
both elbows out, and a backbone, there is nothing stopping any person woman
or man from pursuing the vocation of their calling -- there are even
workarounds for women to be ordained as Catholic priests -- so i'm sorry but
i don't see what the problem is -- people are people, before they are
genders -- and the emotional palette in very truth is more similar, between
the sexes, than different -- so again, i just don't see the problem here --
so sorry -- i would really prefer not to get dragged into these exceedingly
complex problems because it is nearly impossible to summarize in one chatty
graph the issues and eventualities of the matters -- and then to get taken
to task because the concise response doesn't address everyone's different
highly developed sensibility on labyrinthine problems -- so please take this
for what it is -- a brief sketch -- on a topic that is really not that
primary as far as i'm concerned -- there are other topics a lot more
interesting as far as i can say -- i do not mean to diminish what the poster
is trying to do but again, i just don't see it --

with apologies, if you would like to discuss this with me and i'm not the
authority on gender issues please contact me offlist

from a collection in progress called "Variations on a Theme
by Shelley"


The That of Is

 From one argument rise puzzling
and be seen in evil, not for an "if"
or god there:

The ultimate whim, the truly fulfilled,
meaning's own totem, prime essence,
identical supremely conscious justice,
snoopy risk arbitrage plus utter care
(or whatever you call it)
ignores challenging.

Yet the Orphic energy of lifespans
which once baffled thought,
and to numberless dreamland domes
was an axiom -- peoples here!
How would you or a star sum up,
if to a concocted appraisal
all silence were blank?

A cunning weakness elects
to connect the marked desires:
your straightforward triumph.
Illustrated comes paradise
in that hedonistic afterwards.
