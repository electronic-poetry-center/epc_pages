Overland, Australia's radical nationalist literary quarterly, continues to
be edited by John McLaren and published with the assistance of the
Victorian University of Technology (VUT). Overland is Australia's second
oldest continually published literary magazine - Meanjin is the oldest,
Southerly the first established, but not continuous.

Overland is published quarterly, and from 1995 will appear in February, May,
August and November, so avoiding the plethora of journals that appear at the
end of each quarter.

Its Summer 1995 issue includes Boc Burns on Peter Carey, John Ridland on an
American discovering Australia, and the best fiction and poetry currently
available--as well as an unparalleled helping of review of recent fiction,
poetry. history and politics.

The February issue will feature fiction noire, reviews on the failure of the
revanchist right and tough left, and all the other social and political
issues ignored by our reptile contemporaries.

You can subscribe now for $28 (Aust) for four issues--academic articles are
fully refereed to conform with the malignant policies of DEET and ARC--we
continue to be unfashionably radical and nationalist.

   Dear Ira--Okay, that would be cool if you moved here by me. What
   would you do for "a living" though? I wish I could help you find
   a job here. Maybe you could apply to the school here as a student.
   That's what I'm doing (thanks to the student loan sharks). I'm sorry
   to have been so negative about America or specifically Albany but when
   your post came through I had just been informed that Elizabeth's husband,
   Jeff Hansen, is not getting rehired at his job at the "boy's academy"
   here and the economic pressures that are severely affecting this town

   about this I could send you more info--perhaps off this list...Chris S.

Here's more stuff that I pulled off of the House of Representatives page
on the WWW. Cunningham has been in Congress for 4 years. Here are the
bills he has been the principle author of so far this congress. Except
for what looks like a "local green" bill in there, the rest have a
distinct reactionary flavor. Especially HR 220. Note his cosponsors.
(Doolittle, who shows up more than once, is a rightwinger from the
Sacramento area. Is anyone on this list from UC Davis?) If you have a
congressperson who is listed on one of those bills, you might want to
call his/her office and ask what they can do to influence Cunningham to
get his committee (a subcommittee of the Economic and Educational
Opportunities committee of the house) to report out a bill that
authorizes the NEA.

Remember--from this point of view, it's unimportant whether or not he
supports its funding. In fact, if he wants to vote against any
appropriation, that would not be a killer. Authorization, tho, might be.

I will try to find out stuff on timing in the days ahead.

Dear Tom, My statements about theory/practice were not just replies to
you. They had a context too, which it seems you're not entirely
attending. But I don't want to fight about it. I'm sorry if it seemed I
was not appreciating all the wisdom and clarity of your thought.
I'm sorry if my words were to you "no reaction at all." In the future
I'll try to do better, because it's clear that you're one of the most
important voices on here, and your judgments are crucial.
Yrs, Spencer Selby
P.S. Whatever the context, I don't believe "this discourse proceeds at
the level of the poetry."

Bill,

Thanks for your encouragement of my Jung elaboration. I'm not sure that
this list is the place for opening out all the aphorisms/points I made;
I just hoped it might circulate the manifesto to generate some connection
with the similar minded.
        However, I always answer specific questions. Stockhausen is a
European composer of similar age and period to Cage; Stockhausen uses
some process and chance, but he has also periodically stopped to ask
what he has learned from his chance works, and has always also composed
very carefully chosen work. My point in my manifesto was simply to allege
that a lot of poets want to call themselves *musical* because they get
Cage, or free jazz, as a theoretical gesture, but not as a physical
experience of sound. That poets allied to Zukofsky think he and therefore
they are musical when Zukofsky may namecheck Bach, but is a million miles
further away from Bach than, for example, Pound, in understanding how to
balance and combine cadences and sound, or how to do counterpoint. To take
one example, Pound's use of monosyllables in the early Cantos is, it seems
to me, a technical feat as difficult as musical composition; by his careful
sense of context, dialect and etymology he places words in his poetry so
that they interrogate and are interrogated by other words and lines
*both rhythmically (picking up certain assonances) and semantically
(looking at what the word might mean and has meant)*; this creates a kind
of counterpoint, or slowing of time, as the mind remembers previous words
and lines and mentally plays them in a kind of double-exposure; just as,
when listening to Bach, one can hear phrases recur but in reverse or a
different octave, and one thus hears phrases inside each other. If you
then look at how Zukofsky uses monosyllables in the opening sections of
"A", you find not remotely the same complexity (it's as if he's trying
to copy the surface of Pound without understanding the structure).
        Cage wanted to use randomness in order to defy connections with
the past, to be new in that way. Stockhausen manages a similar break
but also stands equal with past composers, creating equivalent *complexity*
by balancing not so much phrases but cadences, working not in time and
rhythm but physical space. I can't describe it better than that; I juts
just get a huge sense of space, with a sound coming from above, then left,
then throughout the whole space. Cage wanted to get his audience to feel
space, eg 4'33", but Stockhausen can actually sculpt it.

See how long it might take to spell everything out?

Best

Stockhausen (Karlheinz) is a german composer, founder of the
"cologne" school ov electronic music--based in the studios of
radio cologne, very generally using electronic sound sources
(oscillators etc.) as opposed to manipulating found sound
a'la the french muisque concrete school.  altho he & cage
did at some points clash over theory, i believe they "patched
things up" (no pun inteneded, ov course) later, and the german/
french opposition now seems more genuine, at least to me.

dunno, maybe some folks think of cage & his zen influence as
warm & fuzzy, and diametric to a perception of stockhausen's
cold hard "classicism"--readings of both that _i_ find misleading...

The theories and practices of the poets of whom you speak evolved in a
series of books from the early 1970s through the current decade's books
by several of the poets. Anthologies such as *Inthe American Tree*
edited by Ron Silliman and *From the Other Side of the Century* edited
by Douglas Messerli will give you good samplings of some but not all of
the poets involved. *The Language Book* edited by Bernstein and
Andrews (Southern Illiois University Press), *The New Sentence* by Ron
Silliman (Roof Books), *A Poetics* by Charles Bernstein, *The Boundary of
Blur* by Nick Piombino (Roof Books), portions of my own *Our Nuclear
Heritage* (Sun & Moon), and a raft of others by Barrett Watten, Alan
Davies, and forthcoming by still others such as Hank Lazer will articulate
the variety of concerns that were addressed by these poets over the years.
Someone might want to cite the secondary texts which have the purpose of
"summarizing" the works, but I find these less useful since they
translate the mechanisms by which the poets meant and thereby are only
descriptive. Bernstein has a good list of these texts about these poets. But
the point that must be made regarding your query is that the only simplified
material that can be written would be similar to the promotional
literature which was generated to alert librarians and readers to the
presence of tendency in writing. Such promotional literature can't be
used to articulate anything other than the marketing practices of
publishers such as Messerli, Ganick, Bernstein & Andrews, and myself. So
there probably is no short answer and most ofthe poets who participated
in these writings and publications would prefer that they be allowed to
represent themselves when you read them each, not as a lump, since the
poets of whom we speak are as diverse as all the other tendencies
combined and sought another mode of presentation.

So rather than a
summary, I, for one, would ask you to take a look at some of the work.

1)  Between K and N:


Are people really distressed that the generations are going at it?
Isn't that the order of things?  eg. moose, cuckoos. . .

Analysis is beautiful though, even when it's tortured.
Especially when it's tortured.
It makes me feel wily.

A wily woman (CH) said to me once:
Write what you want to write.
And some clever men (CB and AD) wrote:
Write what gives you pleasure.

(that could be grand social responsibility,
philosophy, sparrows, things to eat
or just friction)

2)  Picking up Spencer's gauntlet:

Teaching in Japan I have had to learn all kinds of tricks for getting
silent people to talk, to break their internal barrier against speaking
even if they feel they have nothing to say or are afraid of making a
mistake.  Techniques include sentence completion, anonymous bulletin
boards, teaching gambits for evoking speech to the interlocutors of a
silent person, giving participation points, and listening intently to a
usually quiet one who gets up the nerve to speak.   I wonder if these
techniques could be adapted to a poetry commmunity, and by extension to
any democracy. FILL that air.


By the way it was very hard for me to post this.
Ashamed that my teeth might be part of my skeleton I was obliged to
first blacken them then cover them with my hand.

What is the level of the poetry, Spencer?  Who stratifies all this
language?

I'm thinking of applying to Buffalo.  I'm in e-mail contact with Ben F.,
but would like to hear from others involved in that community about what
it's like.

_exactly_.  the short version is so easily misunderstood as to
be useless fr anything but agitation.  the expanded version
gives me a point of entry, might be part of a dialogue (&
not just a harangue).  and the problem, fr me, w/ much of
what passes here, on these screens, is the time wasted on
agitation.  by which i refer back to the earlier M thread,
where the stance of the intro completely obscures...
response to the slogans seems pointless (haven't you ever
been called names before?), but, i believe, there is some
substance behind their practice (&/or praps related--who
mentioned CHAIN o*blek 12 etc?), which remains unaddressed
and still worth addressing...


& still, ira, i don't think you've got c & s right...

I want to thank all those that replied to my queries about L poetry and
others who took the time to expand their replies to "account" (or at
least ... say more about their positions.  I liked it.  I will be busy
trying to immerse myself  in some of this material and, as a consequence
I'm sure, asking y'all questions about it.

New Titles (1995)
_____________________________________________________________________________

REGISTERS/ (PEOPLE IN ALL) by Clark Coolidge
88 pages                                ISBN 0-939691-10-8              $9.95

Written between May '89 and August '92, these fifty sections of 3-line
stanza/chords continue Coolidge's fast-forward drive to explore how
sheets of sound can be made to echo thought itself:
                                                ." . . . Off where
nerves rattle and glance interminable, the sphere of the bygone
syllable. Lit as if sound, a cascade to a bell."

(OUTSIDE) by Todd Baron
88 pages                                ISBN 0-939691-11-6              $9.95

"Todd Baron's poems in (OUTSIDE) have a clarity that is not being
either speech or thought while seeming the reverberation of 'the
public' from inside 'someone,' "not lines or rhythms or even/ anything
from the outside but on paper from the voice above the water-level/
shouting something beneath." The sense of the poems' shape crosses a
spatial line or level they make that is public/interior." Leslie
Scalapino

Amblyopia  by Jena Osman
48 pages                                ISBN 0-939691-09-4              $8.00

"Amblyopia is an invitation to a new architecture, where spaces are
construed with artifacts of the mindQfavorite haunts, obscure
discoveries, longings, persons and objectsQas well as vital responses to
the habitat it creates. Each gesture leaves a trace "representing a kind
of revolution or paragraph on a relatively fragile topic." The writing
is precise and lush. That we get to follow Jena Osman into her theatre
of invention is an exhilirating pleasure of the first order." Ann
Lauterbach

Second Law  by Elizabeth Willis
64 pages                                ISBN 0-939691-08-
$8.95

"Elizabeth Willis's work is a wonder: an open tangle of thought, a mark
in the darkness, a sudden projection: 'striving between light/ and the
force of a body/ that is light.' These poems draw amazingly delicate
boundaries among the soul's constellations of ambiguities." Beverly
Dahlen

Linen Minus  by Susan Gevirtz
64 pages                                ISBN 0-939691-07-8              $8.00

"'Who wants? / Who walks? Who wants to walk?' When is repetition a kind
of answer? 'The word ignites.' Read the work ignites. Repetition forms
the answer, but what kind of answer? What kind of repetition? Gevirtz's
transformations are unexpected progressions. Deliberate progressions
roll internal rhyme into chords of the marvelous, into rhythmic
visibility, flaunting precognition, pluralizing it. Progressions enact
sensuous form, defer seams, reach unexpected grammatical conclusions.
Restating progressions ritualize. Action thrills meaning among this cast
of secret agents. 'I defy you.'"  Norma Cole

Dear Nada,
Hello, I'm very glad you jumped in.
I hope my statements have not been taken as being in any way against
anyone's wish or need to speak out on anything. This forum seems very
open (maybe even "wide open"), which is one of the best things about it.
I might remind you though, that what is pleasurable for the speaker may
not be for part or all of the listeners.
As for what the level of poetry is, I'm not going to try that one.
Poetry/art has its own level, and whatever it is or may be, it is not the
same as theory or criticism or writers' discourses or internet exchanges.
This view may strike some as extreme, simplistic or old-fashioned, but I
think it's dangerous when artists or critics start saying (or building
contexts in which) their discourse is on the same level as the art.

Subject:      Still Espousing

        Many books have been destroyed, carelessly or by design.  Lost,
burnt, forgotten, volumes drop out of existence, along with--more easily
disposed of--proofs never pulled, unpublished manuscripts, notes for books,
plans and proposals for things to be written, collected, put into books.
The number of projects unaccomplished in history must be enormous.
        And much larger, almost infinite, the realm of projects
unattempted, never started, what no one ever thought to do.

                                        (Keith Waldrop, *Potential Random*).

on the other hand I am not going to espouse any short stories in which

lawn mowers clack.

                                        (James Schuyler, "Freely Espousing")



With apologies for the delay, here are some field reports from *Freely
Espousing* events last weekend.  After taking a few days to recuperate (and
to change from our archaic e-mail software to Eudora), Jennifer and I want
to re-issue our invitation to work with anyone who has ideas on how to
sustain momentum, broaden the support-base, and provide an alternative
voice (where stategic) to the rampant "bottom-line" thinking currently
pervading both sides of the national debate on the Arts.

The disastrous equation of corporate economic interests with the national
interest is not our only option here!

*San Francisco*

On Friday evening, January 27, Kevin Magee and Myung Mi Kim had about three
dozen writers to their home to discuss two anthologies, *writing away here*
and *The New Coast.*  The site is significant: Small Press Traffic, which
might have been in other times a 'natural' place to stage an event such as
*Freely Espousing,* was losing its lease effective Jan 31.  Some of the
writers gathered at Myung and Kevin's had composed "documentary gestures"
(meant to link the NEA issue to the broader social war) earlier in the
week: these were faxed to Providence and Buffalo the following morning.
Kevin reports that the NEA was "there as a pressure" throughout an evening
devoted to opening a dialogue between otherwise segregated "traditions" in
American poetry.

=46ollow-up:  An audio-tape was made of the evening's discussion. Kevin and
Myung have written a brief report of their event for the forthcoming
*Poetry Flash,* where it will appear in the context (we presume) of a piece
Jennifer and I are preparing on *Freely Espousing* more generally.


* Providence *

Organized by Jennifer Moxley and Steve Evans with support from C.D. Wright
and    the Ad-Hoc Council of Literary Presses.
Salomon Hall 101, Brown University 3-7pm
Estimated attendance: 175-200 people throughout the day
=46ormat: Marathon reading of NEA-supported literature & Featured Speakers

Speakers:
Ray Rickman (Host of Bestsellers on Channel 36/PBS and Former RI State
Representative), Representative Jack Reed (D-RI), Michael Harper (Poet,
Professor of Creative Writing at Brown, Former RI Poet Laureate), Tereann
Greenwood (President of RI Arts Advocates and Director of RI Philharmonic),
Roger Mandle (President of RISD), Liam Rector (PEN-Boston), Richard Cumming
(Composer in Residence at Trinity Rep since 1966), Randy Rosenbaum

Press Coverage:
"Freely Espousing lets you speak up for the arts," by Jim Seavor,
Providence     Journal-Bulletin, 27 Jan 95: D1.

Comments: The event was a qualified success--it generated important
publicity, mobilized key defender's of the arts, and lead to local
alliances that have developed throughout the week following the event.  The
video-tape Lee Ann Brown made will come in handy in the next weeks and
months.  We're currently slated to participate in a forum of the broad
implications of the *Contract on America* for Rhode Island (16 Feb).


* New York City *

Organized by Jeff Hull with support from Brenda Coltas
Parish Hall, St. Mark's Poetry Project 3-6pm
Estimated attendance:50
=46ormat: Letter-writing and brief program of speakers.  Event followed a
reading by Kate Rushin at the Ear Inn.

Jeff estimates that 70 longhand letters and 150 postcards were generated at
the event itself.

Speakers: Anne Burt of the Literary Network, Elizabeth Murray, others.
Attended: Bruce Andrews, Ron Padgett, Eliot Katz, Alfred Corn.

=46ollow-up: Discussion of future events focused on moving beyond the
strictly literary set.  More as it develops.

*Buffalo*

(what follows is taken from an e-mail Jena Osman sent us earlier today)

The Buffalo version of the "Freely Espousing" event was re-dubbed "SAVE
THE artWORLD."  This event was not focused so much on the writing community'=
s
relation to the NEA, as it was on the many arts programs in the city which
depend on federal/public funding; music, theater, visual arts, arts educatio=
n
programs, etc.  The event was organized by myself (Jena Osman), with help fr=
om
Anjanette Brush (director of Big Orbit Gallery), sponsored by the National
Association of Artists' Organizations, and took place in the newly built cin=
ema
in the Hallwalls Center for Contemporary Arts.  Outside the cinema, in the m=
ain
gallery, were computers and printers set up for letter writing, tables of
photocopied articles and info. about the NEA, books by NEA authors for sale
from Talking Leaves Bookstore, food, talk, and the current Hallwalls member'=
s
show up on the walls.
        The day consisted of a mixture of speeches and artistic presentation=
s.
Vincent O'Neill of the Irish Classical Theatre Company gave a dramatic readi=
ng
of a section of his one-man show on the work of James Joyce, "Joyicity."
Eighth graders from public school 45 read poems and stories that they had
written with local writers from Just Buffalo Literary Center's
Writers-in-Education program.  Manny Fried, a local playwright and labor
activist, read from his play "The Dodo Bird."  Film-maker Tony Conrad showed
two films side by side--one purportedly made before he received an NEA grant=
,
one made after he received an NEA grant.  Susan Howe read poems by Wilfred
Owen.  Raymond Federman read an excerpt from a novel which he had written wi=
th
the help of NEA support.  Random Axe, a band consisting of cello, banjo and
guitar, played a short set, and the 12/8 Path Band played some socially
activating tunes as well.  Other participants included Ed Cardoni of Hallwal=
ls,
Louise Caldi of the Greater Buffalo Opera Company, Arlette Rosen of Pick of =
the
Crop Dance Company, Deborah Ott of the Just Buffalo Literary Center, Univers=
ity
at Buffalo professor Myles Slatin with a message from State Assemblyman Sam
Hoyt, media makers Brian Springer and Jody Lafond, Buffalo State College Art
Conservation student, Sarah Stauterman, composer David Felder, Buffalo
writer-in-residence, A.M. Alcott and I'm sure there are others I'm forgettin=
g
to mention.
        It's been estimated that over 200 people spent some time at the even=
t,
and all three TV stations showed up, two of them covering the story on the
6-o-clock news.  Many letters were written, and many LitNet action cards
signed.  A primary target of the letter-writing campaign was Representative
Jack Quinn of District 30, a Republican who is perceived as a potential swin=
g
vote in favor of the NEA.  I believe the event was fairly successful at
informing the community how NEA cuts will directly impact accessibility to t=
he
arts in Buffalo.  However, I think everyone realized that this event marked
only the beginning, and hopefully those who attended are already thinking of
what needs to be done next.


*Washington*

Organized by Joe Ross and Mark Wallace
Willow Street Gallery, 1-5pm
Estimated attendance: 40 (on a snowy day)
=46ormat: Open Reading with brief program of speakers.

Speakers included Alexander Ooms and Cliff Becker (both from the NEA).
Attended: Tina Darragh, Peter Inman, Tom Mandel, Joan Retallack, Beth
Joselow, Rod Smith and others.

=46ollow-up: Joe writes "To sum it up: positive, good feeling of purpose,
left us ready to do more."


* San Diego *

Organized by Craig Foltz and Cole Heinowitz
The Wicki Up, 1-6 pm
Estimated Attendance: 50-75 people
=46ormat: Marathon Reading with Featured Speakers.

Performance/Symposium: On the History, Present, and Future of the NEA.

Speakers/Readers:  Quincy Troupe, Michael Davidson, Miguel Algar=EDn (poet,
founder of Nuyorican Cafe), Pasquale Verdicchio, Eloise Deleon (Performing
Arts Director at the Centro Cultural de la Raza), Deedee Haleck (Paper
Tiger Video and TV), Rae Armantrout, Fanny Howe, Mel Freilicher (writer and
former co-chair of Sushi Performance Gallery), Jerome Rothenberg, Harold
Jaffe, Maggie Jaffe, Ralph Lewin (California Council for the Humanities),
Rand Steiger (Director of the Ph.D. in Music at UCSD, former director of LA
Philharmonic).

Press: When we spoke to Cole on Sunday, coverage in the next day's SD Union
seemed likely (can anyone vouch for that?).

=46ollow-up: About 10-12 people stayed after and forged a short agenda for
the coming week.  Discussion focused on broadening network to include SD
Symphony, Escondido Arts Center (in Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham's
district),etc.

There might be some agitation, but it seems healthy.   Poets on the whole
tend to be rather annoying.

Another tack, however, might be to discuss things in the world that are
influencing the art, obsessions.  I enjoyed eric pape's spirit story more
than recent theoretical calls to the M.

Lately, I've been staring at high tension towers to get "inspiration."
I've even taken to rendering them in photoshop.  I can't articulate why
I'm obsessed with power lines, but it/they continue to drive the work.

Perhaps this tack is too individualistic to have meaning to a large group.
 But I am more interested in learning new methods of doing good work--
how to get new obsessions--than in discussing the correct way to write.

I'd be curious to know what motivates others.

GOVERNMENT BY IRRITATION

     Government by irritation: it's one of the dominant political
modes of our day. Taking their cue from talk show hosts,
politicians try to topple their opponents by unleashing discontent.
These days the NEA serves as a handy source of annoyance if not
outrage: a few well-publicized examples of troublesome art have,
over the last few years, been able to furnish a great supply of
instant political energy.
     It's not easy to argue against such energy. The value of art
is not always instantly apparent--and at the same the difficulties
art brings with it are much more likely to be perceived at a
glance. The latest remarks by senators that the NEA be abolished
unless it supports "family values" show how true this is.
     Rather than arguing for art that is familiar, obedient and at
best ornamental, I think case that art is valuable to the community
precisely because it is not perfectly predictable or obedient. That
will not mean that unruly art is automatically wonderful. Art is
one of the testing grounds between individuals and the community.
The point is that it's an opportunity for judgment: members of the
community will need to make up their minds. That's one of the basic
values of art: it can't be approached dogmatically.
     If it's considered in terms of the federal budget as a whole,
the NEA is hardly a big deal. The federal budget is around a
trillion and a half dollars a year; the NEA budget is $167 million.
If my math holds, that means that the NEA takes up about one ten
thousandth of the federal budget. That's less than the military
spends on marching bands, less than the city of Berlin spends on
public art.
     To eliminate the NEA would save each American 65 cents a year.
Here in Philadelphia, dance, poetry, the visual arts, theater would
all suffer; the gamut of organizations affected would range from
the Institute for Contemporary Art to the Please Touch Museum, from
the Philadelphia Orchestra to the Settlement Music School. The
bigger, more established concerns would take a hit; some of the
smaller organizations might have to close. Those who are out of
sympathy with the arts might think that's fine: that if a theater
company needs a handout to survive there's something wrong with it.
But to consider the arts in such a framework is an unfair
oversimplification.
     For one thing, business itself is not treated in such a sink-
or-swim way: government subsidies are an integral part of many
industries, from farming to sports franchises. One of the better
reasons for such subsidies is that they shield enterprises from
momentary reverses. If farmers couldn't survive a single bad
season, it would ultimately make for a weak social fabric. With the
arts, the time frame is often more stretched out. It can easily
take decades for general taste to approve of developments in art.
The last hundred years are full of examples. In France painters
such as Monet and Matisse were ridiculed by the majority of their
contemporaries; there was a riot at the premier of Stravinski's
"Rites of Spring." Of course, paintings by Monet and Matisse are
now among the most valuable objects on the planet; and thirty years
after it had driven listeners into a frenzy of disgust,
Stravinski's music was used by Disney as the soundtrack to the
dinosaur section of "Fantasia."
     These are examples of successes. But it's not always the case
that today's innovative art becomes tomorrow's classic. A 1920's
symphony by George Antheil that used airplane engines has not yet
become a cultural treasure (nor is it likely to). That's important.
It misses the point to say "Fine, innovate, be creative. But only
if you turn out to be Monet. No duds or wild excesses, please."
     But why should the government have to underwrite art? Didn't
Monet work on his own? There are a couple of answers to this. For
one thing, a significant part of NEA money goes to community
groups, often helping get art to groups and places it doesn't
normally reach: smaller towns, rural areas, schools that don't have
the resources for art programs. And for the government to cut all
arts funding would mean that it recognizes no values other than the
marketplace.
     Under the reign of purely economic motives, there is no way
anyone would want to produce something unless it could be sold
immediately. Imagine a society in which every cultural product had
to turn a profit instantly. If you want to get a sense of how
claustrophobic this can be, consider how dominated commercial
television by spinoffs and imitations.
     Given how informative, exciting, and revealing the arts can
be, what an important antidote they are to instant opinion polls,
and how important they already are to various different parts of
the community, I think they're worth 65 cents a year. The money is
not wasted: people in the arts are appreciative of the little
support they get and work hard whether or not they get it. By their
very nature, the arts speak to the individual's judgment at the
same time as they offer possibilities for building communities:
they're perfect training for the independence and possible sense of
connection that we need to live in a democracy. Maybe 65 cents is a
bit low. Why not make it $1.30?

What, Jeffrey Timmons asks, constitutes a reaction to my view?
Well, let me start by saying that I think I wrote in a bit
too snippish way in my own response to you, Jeffrey.

At the heart of what I said in the post to which you were responding was this:

        "a discourse in re: poetry that is interesting to
        poetry is one that adds space for poetry to be
        made. Adds space."

I want to hear someone discuss poetry with an emphasis on how work does its job
in relation to the world it inhabits. The place of theory (even theory of
poetry) with respect to poetry, to writing, is not that the theory resolves the
work, as if you turn to the theory to help understand the work. Rather, theory,
theoretical concerns or convictions operate as what Aristotle would have called
"efficient causes"; they set a work, perhaps even a body of work, into motion,
they get it going. You can't turn back to the theory, however, to understand
the work itself - tho of course you can seek indications or intentions anywhere
you find data to support them - and above all theory does not operate to
justify the work. An acquaintance with the manifestos or even the ideas of
surrealism is not necessary to understand Breton's _Nadja_. Might it not be
helpful? It might be, to one or another reader; but, I could as easily imagine
a reader to whom it would not provide entry to the work, even a reader whose
response to the work would be dulled or diminished, dumbed out, by an attention
to surrealistic theory (even more so to interpretations thereof).

What then is a "discourse in re: poetry... that adds space for poetry to be
made"?

Anything that asks, or attempts to answer, that question is "a response
to my view." Yours would be different from mine, and different from
Charles Bernstein's. I recommend, because I did in the original post
but without naming it, Mandelstam's "Conversation About Dante" as an
example of what is in response to my view (i.e. I am in response to
it - since, again as I had it in my original post, "a connection with the past
[being] no different from a connection with the future.")

Does anybody know this poem? It's only a handful of lines long,

Dear Bob,

Just a quick note to wish you luck with Saturday's event.  Jen
and I were happy to learn of it and we read you op-ed piece with
interest.

Please let us know how it comes off (and I'll have my dad, who
lives in S.Jersey, look for coverage on the local news).

We're faxing a 4-6 pp. piece on Freely Espousing to Poetry Flash
late Sunday night, so if you have any information about your
event that you'd like us to include, get in touch with us &
we'll try to work it in.  (This piece is pretty basis: After
a rousing few words we'll be providing accounts of what
happened in various places, stressing how such actions are
relatively easy to organize, etc.).

Again, we wish the best to yourself, Susan Stewart, and Gil Ott.
May the skies cooperate!

Yours,

Steve Evans

p.s. Have you seen the Douglas Davis article on NEA/NEH in the current *Art in
America* ("Multicultural Wars," Feb 1995: 35-45)?  I just read it
this afternoon & found it pretty useful, especially in its emphasis
on the pitfalls of "conciliation."

Dear Tom,
Excuse my blunder. Yr post was not addressed and it seemed you
might be talking to me, or maybe both of us at the same time. I guess I
was butting in without knowing it. I do have an interest in what you're
saying to Jeffrey, and a disagreement, I'm afraid.
I would say theory is, as such, no more positive in getting the work
going than it is with understanding. In both cases it is a double-edged
sword, just as dangerous or potentially destructive as it may be
beneficial. Anything that attempts to ask or answer yr question (about
adding space for poetry) is certainly a response, but whether that
anything is successful, or more helpful than dangerous or destructive, is
very much open to question.
Formulated theory or knowledge may play a large or small role in an
individual's creative life. Whatever the role, it is up to the
individual, who cannot look to others for answers about this which may be
necessarily correct.
That's my reaction to yr most recent message to Jeffrey. Despite my
disagreement, it struck me as quite interesting and provocative. Yr words
are never blah blah blah to me. Which may be why I keep butting in.
Yrs, Spencer Selby

     Maybe we need to broaden our definition of theory to "a man's total

I cant remember the details of the context in whixh Cienfuegos made
his sharp comment on revolutionary art. I read an account in a
Mexican newspaper (this a short time before C.'s plane disappeared),
and I do remember that the contxt (for the newspaper story) was that
Cienfuegos seemd to have Fidel's ear, and the hope was that the CP
would not come along and impose its usual ban on Freud, surrealism,
etc. I should have been a auto-clipping service at the time.

Subject:      Use da news 2

I was happy to see Bob Perelman's Philadelphia Enquirer op-ed.  I think that
op-ed pages may be as good a tool in this fight as contacting congressmen
directly.  I've heard many like to sustain their illusions of *fingers on the
pulse* through hometown papers.

This is my column from the Milwaukee Journal, Friday, January 13:

With the recent swing in Congree back toward Reagan-era conservatism has come
a new attempt to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.

The NEA's budget isn't large, but its critics argue that any amount the
government spends on the arts is too much, that funding the arts is not a
legitimate function of government.  Gingrich, Helms and others make this
argument despite the examples of other major world governments, nearly all of
which make funds available to support art and artists, many at much higher
levels than the U.S.

 This simply highlights the fact that the main reason conservatives want to
stop funding the arts is not to save money nor to keep government's purposes
pure.  It is because new art is ultimately very dangerous to a conservative
world-view.  Discouraging the production of non-commercial art in this
country is consistent with other aspects of the conservative social agenda:
school prayer, limiting women's reproductive freedoms, increasing the amount
of capital in the coffers of America's richest citizens.  The arts produce
work that is often far too critical of such a social agenda to make many
friends on the Right.  These lawmakers want to silence voices of dissent.

Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold sees their attempt in the proper perspective,
as censorship.  I wrote him and several other Wisconsin lawmakers in the past
few months to urge they support thet NEA.   Feingold responded, "I believe,
as a free society, we need to protect diversity and encourage the exchange of
ideas.  I regard some recent attempts to cut funding for NEA as attempts at
censorship, and at silencing one part of this discussion."

 This position is consistent with the principles upon which the NEA was
founded.  At the inception of the NEA in 1965, Congress issued a defense of
why governments should fund the arts.  In part, it read: "The world
leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest solely upon
superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly founded upon
worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation's high qualities as a leader
in the realm of ideas and of the spirit."

 It also read: "Democracy demands wisdom and vision of its citizens.  It must
therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and
the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever
located masters of the technology and not its unthinking servants."

 The NEA is most often reported in the press for scandals involving funding
of controversial artists, such as the flap involving late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe a couple years ago.  But its programs support the arts in local
communities as well.  This occurs both in terms of aiding local artists
(individually or through local arts organizations) and in such things as
helping fund performances by nationally known artists.  In my own area, I
think of the readings at Milwaukee's Woodland Pattern bookstore, for example;
poets and fiction writers of national stature would not regularly give
readings to small audiences in Milwaukee, as they do today, without the NEA.
 For people in your district, it might be the local orchestra or theatre, a
travelling opera or ballet troupe.

 I confess I am not a disinterested observer of this issue.  Last year I was
awarded an NEA Literature Fellowship.  I take the grant seriously, as an
investment in my talent, and I hope my future work merits this investment.
 The myth of the artist whose vision remains pure despite economic
difficulties is bogus; economics do force artists to quit making art and
start making money.  I was close to giving up fiction writing when I received
funding.

But I had also benefitted as a citizen from the NEA for years prior to
winning this fellowship.  I had attended NEA sponsored readings, theatre and
concerts; I had read writers and seen work by artists who had their own
careers supported by the NEA; I had enjoyed the benefits of local galleries
and performance spaces which exist with the support of the NEA.  I happen to
enjoy art that isn't commerical, that wasn't created to make money.  But even
people whose interest in art extends no further than enjoying Hollywood
movies should realize that even commercial artists owe a debt to serious,
non-commercial art.  Art not made for money takes more risks, taps more
untouched stores of imagination, and often introduces the ideas and images
that mainstream artists develop for more popular tastes.  We all benefit from
the NEA.

 Art also can provide us with morality of a sort different than the Right
defines it.  Not simply indulging in tired pieties, serious art, when
critical of our institutions and our daily practices, can serve as the
bell-ringer to wake up our national conscience.  Funding the arts helps
foster voices of dissent, a necessity in a healthy democracy.

But Helms, Gingrich and company aren't interested in good art or healthy
democracy.  Nor is my congressman in Sheboygan, James Sensenbrenner.  He has
voted to eliminate the NEA for the past four years.  He cites the same old
cost arguments as the others.  But money is a cloak over the real issue: the
critics of the NEA want to promote their own set of cultural values while
discouraging debate and critique.  If money was the only issue, we would
naturally expect Republicans to subject far more expensive weapons programs
to the same cost-conscious scrutiny as they do the arts.

For my part, I'd rather that someone abroad knew about my country because of

Spencer,
        I didn't think you'd butted in, not at all. Just wanted
you to know I wasn't responding to something you'd articulated.
There is no 3d position, outside the relation of person to what
that person thinks, writes, reads, that can tell you if something
is useful or not. The test is simple; if it's useful then it's
useful. I.e. if an idea is provocative and allows one to
work or enhances work, makes a new space for work then it's
of interest. My caveat re: the Apexites (last mention) was
that I was waiting for the impact of their ideas on work they'd
do. Period. Natch, I have my own version of whther that's likely
to be a positive impact, but that measures only its impact on
me. After all, everybody knows I"m interested in _spirit_
(whatever that is), only they faiiled to mention what kind;
in my tradition there are 3 forms of spirit. And even this
line of thought, I take to be an attempt to articulate and
render a little more subtle the Xtian notions taken over
from a rather simple-minded roman _paganism_ (no bettre
wrod comes to mind), which is how you get humans who are
also divine, virginity as a cool positive value in the
religion, and other affairs of _spiritual_ value in that
tradition which are to me... oh, I dunno would vulgar
and primitive be acceptable words? Not to step on
any toes or anything.

that whole paragraph shd have some keyboard graphic for
tongue in cheek and serious at the same time, what my
father (sleeping with all of them tonite, in peace) used
to call _ribbing on the square_ (no doubt a westside chicago
piece of 1920's lingo).

no one has the pessoa citation at hand? Lots of books at
Buffalo...

Shd we discuss the 3 kinds of spirit in the Jewish intellectual
tradition? how'bout it Spencer?

It's odd what strikes one isn't it?  For me, among a host of "things,"
old boxes, pieces of twisted and rusted metal I find along the rail road
tracks by my house, the sound of the hummingbirds, grackles, doves,
sparrows, and mockingbirds intermingling, the terrible noises I can make
with my computer's sound processing software or my guitar . . .  these
things turn up in my writing in various ways and without trying to reduce
any of the plurality of the different expressions to single subject I
would hazard that there is some shared set of concerns in each.  The idea
of place--"The most in time is where you're meant to be"--has been of
vital importance lately, trying to document the sense of being in a
particular location; this takes its form in music by recording the sounds
of a space of time--whatever happens in that time--and then layering
these into juxtapositions of moments.  This has the benefit of
inspiration and of craft.  I'd be excited to share some of these
experiments with anyone, were they interested (send snail address).
Anyway, I thought the question a good one as it raises the nuts and bolts
(and philosophical attitudes) of work and would like to continue with
this ... but I've got to go now.  I'd like to take this to writing....

Thanks to Tom Mandel for elaborating his comments, they were much
appreciated.  I must mull over the question of what provides space for
poetry as it is worth a more detailed response than I am capable of at
present.  Spencer can butt in any time, as far as I'm  concerned.  It's fun.

Subject:      BIG BROTHER is asking

Folks,

Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, recently sent a letter to the heads of the CPB,
NPR, and PBS asserting that privatization/commercialization of
public broadcasting was inevitable.  The letter demands information
to incriminate public broadcasting as purveyors of leftist dissent
and asks for financial data (to expedite commercialization).

The Senator is angry at the CPB's meager attempts to protect itself
by distributing information about the funding situation.  Pressler
is not content to simply rail against Frontline for bias, P.O.V.
(independent video) for bias, and American Playhouse for nudity and
profanity, he also decries underwriters for influencing program
content (how this will be solved by the introduction of completely
deregulated market forces and advertising remains unclear to me).

After Pressler's closed-door meetings with info-mogul Rupert
Murdoch, a union shamefully under-reported, it now appears that
expansion into the non-commercial bandwidth is the real prize for
media conglomerates.  Once they're sold off they're gone for good,
reclaiming them would be next to impossible.  This also sets a
dangerous precedent for the net:  if public educational programming
is pushed off the air, how much bandwidth can we expect will be set
aside for free educational use if they get around to carving up the
internet?

If we sit by and shrug we'll get what we deserve:  a sea of
informercials, complimentary copy, Howard Stern, and Power Rangers,
in perpetuity.  I'll be posting a letter to download and send
Pressler soon.  Please do something.

I'm attaching an excerpted version of Pressler's questions.
Credit where credit is due, he does manage to mention Paul
DeMan and Barney on the same page.  If you'd like the full
text e-mail me at v139hla3@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu; also, check
out the usenet group wny.wbfo.

Dear Mr. Carlson:

     Enclosed is a series of questions concerning the operation
of public broadcasting.  In addition to responses to these
questions, please include any documentation, memos, meeting
notes, contracts and any other written material to substantiate
the answers to these questions.

     Please respond to these questions by February 10, 1995.

     Thank you for your prompt reply.

Sincerely,
(signed by Sen. Larry Pressler)
LP/dma

All answers to questions should be substantiated with written
materials, documents, memos, meeting notes, contracts, etc.

5.   Please detail all efforts by recipients of CPB funds to
     generate Congressional support for continued federal
     funding:

     a.   How much has been spent of this effort by all of public
          broadcasting?

     b.   How much has been spent to present the other side of
          this controversial issue?

     e.   Please list all news coverage and interview programs
          and provide transcripts.

     f.   Please explain how CPB has assured that this is
          balanced and objective coverage.

6.   Does CPB have printed guidelines for grant applications for
     the program fund?  How are decisions made on which programs
     to fund?  At what stage are considerations of balance and
     objectivity brought to bear?  Please explain step-by-step
     the processes involved.

     d.   Some have suggested the lack of competition in public
          television is due to anti-competitive practices at PBS.
          How is CPB working to increase competition and monitor
          collusion and pricefixing in public television?

          2.) Please provide a list of controversial issues
              covered by NPR and related programs.

9.   Of CPB's total budget, why is only $4 million allotted to
     the National Radio Program Production Fund?

     e.   Document each one of last year's awards and indicate
          how they fulfill your priorities to: 1) increase and/or
          diversify public radio's audience, 2) yield quality
          programming that is illuminating and inspiring as well
          as appealing, and 3) seek programmatic innovation.

     j.   Submit job descriptions of all 475 full time NPR
          employees. Include gender, age, time of service,
          salary, and ethnicity.

     k.   Please submit a list of regular part-time employees.
          Include gender, age, time of service, salary, and
          ethnicity.

10.  CPB provides funding to PBS's National Program Service.

     c.   How are programs reviewed for objectivity and balance
          prior to funding? Please describe the process in
          detail. Does the CPB board participate in this process?

     h.   How are political balance and diverse religious and
          cultural perspectives represented?

     i.   Does CPB keep racial and ethnic data to assure
          compliance with EEOC directives? How does CPB ensure
          against religious discrimination? Please provide a copy
          of all guidelines.

     j.   Some producers feel that their applications do not
          receive full attention from CPB staff. Several months
          ago, one producer submitted a documentary proposal
          about the "United States Merchant Marine" to CPB
          President Carlson, who wrote back to say that he had
          passed it along to the programming department. The
          producer never heard from CPB again.

          1.) What was the disposition of the Merchant Marine
              proposal?

          7.) How many proposals does ITVS reject each year? Does
              ITVS provide a list and description of rejected
              proposals? If not, how can Congress provide
              effective oversight without knowing what was
              rejected, what was funded, and the reasons?

          8.) Has ITVS rejected any proposals for a documentary
              on the controversy surrounding literary critic Paul
              DeMan, father of "deconstruction"? If so, please
              provide complete documentation for this decision,
              including panel comments.

12.  What are the profit sharing provisions in CPB contracts with
     producers and stations who derive revenue from CPB supported
     productions?

     a.   Please provide copies of contracts with producers and
          copies of accounting for revenues and expenditures
          related to CPB financed distributors including:

              1.)  Children's Television Workshop, Inc.
              2.)  New York Center for Visual History, Inc.
              3.)  Public Affairs Television, Inc.
              .
              .
              .

          3.) What is the commercial value of the current public
              broadcasting system. That is, what is the
              comparative valuation of the hardware--satellite
              transponders, transmitters, studio , etc.--and
              software--library of programs belonging to system
              producers, goodwill, etc.?

          4.) Please list the top 100 salaries paid related to
              public broadcasting. Include producers, vendors of
              merchandise, and executives of companies whose
              product is sold or displayed in public
              broadcasting.

          5.) What is the value of real estate, stock and bond
              portfolios owned by public broadcasters and/or
              their parent organizations. Please break this down
              by station and include related production
              companies.

          6.) What would be the value of comparable commercial
              time equivalent to that provided by public
              broadcasting? Please provide a sample rate card for
              public radio and television.

13.  Some critics have complained that "underwriting for content"
     is a form of payola or plugola.

     a.   How does CPB ensure that underwriting has no influence
          on programming?

     d.   Should the National Science Foundation be permitted to
          underwrite science coverage on NPR? Should it be
          permitted to underwrite a series on exploration for
          PBS?

     e.   Please provide a list of underwriters and the content
          area of programs they sponsor in public broadcasting.

     h.   The National Education Association sponsors news
          programming on NPR, for example. Does this create the
          impression of impropriety, since the NEA also attempts
          to influence legislation?

     i.   NPR spends its own money and resources on lobbying
          Capitol Hill. How does NPR keep its lobbying activities
          separate from its news broadcasts? Please provide
          documentation of the procedures.

     m.   Doesn't the requirement for balanced and objective
          coverage apply equally to the controversy over public
          broadcasting funding?  If not, why not?

     n.   What amount of money has CPB spent on any and all
          advertising or promotion campaigns designed to increase
          public support for public broadcasting?

     o.   Has CPB ever spent any money on advertisements or
          promotions raising questions about the management and
          integrity of the public broadcasting system?

     p.   How can CPB justify spending money in advertising or
          promotions or money for only one side of the public
          broadcasting debate?

     q.   Please give a comparable market value for the air time
          on PBS stations for the Hal Riney spots promoting
          public broadcasting.

14.  Some critics have complained that public broadcasting
     provides promotional value for books and other products in
     addition to educational services.

     a.   Please list all books, records, CDs and other items
          promoted on public radio and television since 1992 at
          both a local and national level.

     b.   Please list gross sales of these items, and analyze the
          contribution public broadcasting exposure might have
          had to their success.

          1.) For example, what were sales of Armistead Maupin's
              "Tales of the City" prior to the announcement of
              the PBS series? And what were they afterwards? How
              much money can one say Armistead Maupin made due to
              sales of his book through PBS promotion?

     c.   How are books, records, and CDs chosen for promotion on
          PBS through related programming? Please describe the
          procedures used in each case since 1992.


15.  Some conservative producers have complained of PBS
     executives giving them a hard time for ideological reasons.

     a.   Please describe the changes PBS required in Michael
          Pack's film "Campus Culture Wars" and give the reason
          for each change. Were these types of editorial
          oversight decisions made by PBS executives prior to
          broadcast of "The liberators" and "Journey to the
          Occupied Lands?"

     b.   Please describe the changes PBS is requiring in the
          second episode of "Reverse Angle" and the reasons for
          each change. Were these types of editorial oversight
          decisions made by PBS executives prior to broadcast of
          "the Liberators" and "Journey to the Occupied Lands"?

     c.   Please describe the changes PBS required in the recent
          Ford Foundation-funded documentary about Community
          Development Corporations. If no changes were required,
          why not? How did this program meet PBS guidelines
          designed to prevent underwriters from benefitting from
          the subject matter of the programs they fund.

     e.   Have John Dinges at NPR and Mary Jane McKinven at PBS
          done a good job of assuring balance and objectivity in
          programming? If so, why are there so many complaints?

16.  What steps has CPB taken since Sen. Dole's speech on
     "Barneygate" to participate in the profits of CPB funded
     programs? Please provide specific examples and copies of
     contracts.

17.  Please provide a list of all political contributions over
     $250 dollars made by individuals employed by or working
     under contract for CPB-funded entities.

22.  In 1992 Congress passed legislation requiring the CPB board
     of directors to take steps to insure balance and objectivity
     in programming, including the review of programs to identify
     balance programs and the commissioning of remedial programs.

     a.   How many programs did the CPB board review for balance
          and objectivity from 1992 to present?

     b.   How many programs were identified as having problems
          with balance and objectivity?

     c.   How many programs were funded to correct programs with
          balance and objectivity problems?

     d.   What procedures for review and commissioning of
          programs to ensure balance and objectivity have been
          established by the CPB board since 1992?

     e.   When CPB director Vic Gold complained about
          anti-semitic programming on a Pacifica radio station
          funded by CPB, did the CPB board review Pacifica's
          programming for balance and objectivity? If not, why
          not?

     f.   Without such a review, how can CPB assure Congress that
          Pacifica stations are fulfilling community service
          obligations under the public telecommunications act to
          provide excellence, diversity, objectivity, balance
          etc.?

     k.   How does CPB insure stations provide balance and
          objectivity in programming they produce and distribute?

     l.   Has CPB ever denied funding to a producing station
          because its productions were not balanced or objective?

     m.   If so, which stations?

     n.   If not, how did CPB determine productions from these
          stations were balanced or objective?

     o.   Has CPB ever denied funding to any station consortium
          because of complaints programs were not balanced or
          objective or for other reasons, since passage of the
          1992 legislation?

          1.) There have been complaints about Frontline from a
              variety of groups and individuals.  Please provide
              correspondence between CPB and the Frontline
              consortium relating to issues of balance and
              objectivity in consortium programming.

          2.) There have been complaints about The American
              Experience regarding programs, including "The
              Liberators."  Please provide correspondence between
              CPB and The American Experience relating to issues
              of balance and objectivity in their programming.

          3.) There have been complaints about American Playhouse
              programming on grounds of profanity, nudity, and
              indecency as well as questions of balance and
              objectivity.  Please provide correspondence between
              CPB and American Playhouse in this regard.

     p.   Has CPB ever withheld funding from any other series or
          production entity because of failure to provide
          balanced and objective programming?

          1.) There have been complaints about the P.O.V. series
              and ITVS's objectivity and balance.  Please provide
              copies of correspondence with P.O.V. and ITVS
              relating to this issue.

          2.) CPB director Vic Gold has inquired how a show
              called "Don't Believe the Hype" will treat this
              issue.  Please provide copies of correspondence
              between CPB and the producers.

     q.   Has CPB ever commissioned a program or series
          specifically to balance an inadequate  program or
          series?

     r.   Has CPB ever required a producer, station, or

         NEW YORK (AHP) -- Despite all the glitz and glamour of New
York's po-literati, authors and publishers were unable to stitch
together the fraying fabric of the once-famous National Endowment
for the Arts.
         A cross-dressing fashion benefit called "Fidgety Spouting"
nevertheless gave occasion for a poetry free-for-all that left
participants wondering if it's all worth the effort.
         James Sherry, Segue's CEO, lent his bowery loft space for
the showings, and gave the poets permission to use a recently abandoned
building near famed punk rock club CBGB's for dressing.
         But the loft was too small to seat the long guest list, and the
streets around CBGB's are no place for a ``signora'' to be walking,
especially in mink and jewels.

         Even the cash bar offered by Sherry at the quickly planned
romp was not enough to lift the spirits of the crowd, who fear the
end of New York as a literary capital.
         Gone are the heady days of the 1960s when Frank O'Hara, Joe
Brainard and Jim Brodey dressed as Giulietta Masina, Audrey Hepburn
and Sophia Loren, sipping drinks with the world's titled and wealthy.
         Gone is Alice Notley, who single-handedly kept New York on the
international lit map until she packed her bags for Paris.
         The fashionable pack who swoop into Paris and Vancouver have
long ago abandoned New York. So have many of the top younger poets,
presumably because the local publishers don't have enough money to
put out their books.
         Despite their gratitude to Sherry, poets also lament the
lack of a glamorous site for the readings. The Paris shows are at the
Louvre.
         Last but not least was the quality of the poetry on the
Bowery runway. Except for a tiny few such as Bernstein, Lauterbach
and Godfrey, the big names are gone. The field is left to
little-known writers catering mainly to the Lower East Side

``slacker'' crowd.
         ``What we have heard tonight was ugly self-indulgent lang-po
dolled up with bridal gowns,'' said Rob Fitterman, who has helped
run the Ear Inn series for several years.  ``Where is the music?''
         Others were put off by the sameness of the verse.  ``The
dresses showed more imagination than the poetry,'' said Paul Beatty,
who recalled in his own outfit the chic touch of his Southern
California origins.
         Things got ugly when a restive Eileen Myles challenged the
``girls'' to submit to a wet t-shirt contest. ``Ladies, ladies!''
shouted a heavily made-up Bruce Andrews, ``Remember the '70s! Women's
lib!''
         If things don't change, says Fitterman, New York couture has
``a maximum of two more years of life.''
         For the next round of the ``Fidgety Spouting'' events, Sherry
has promised some of New York's most famous outdoor spots such as
Times Square and the Central Park Reservoir, already the site of the
televised fashion gala, ``Donne Sotto le Stelle.''

In the original Greek use of the word theory, it was not opposed to
praxis but to doxa (orthodox), so that theory related to the conduct of
the individual life and doxa to social conduct and rites in society.
Ref: Habermas. I have an extensive discussion of this in Our Nuclear
Heritage where the concept of theoretical poetry is broached.

Just taking this opportunity at the mention of the poets of Canada to add
to the list of poetry books addressing the subject of Language poetry
from the Canadians:
Alan Davies, *Signage* (Roof Books)
Steve McCaffery *North of Intention* (Roof Books co-published in Canada
by Nightwood)
and Steve's issue of *Open Letter* called "Politics of the Referent"
which was central to the process of "defining" language poetry for better
and for getting it labelled, but Steve referred to it as
"language-oriented" poetry (not the first time the phrase was used).

If you want to know it's there to be found out.

You know Tom I wonder why with all this discussion of Apex, there have
been no remarks from any of the signators which strikes me as what one
person called Martini Terrorism or have they said it all in their
magazine. Will you dance? If not, I suspect that the forum is too scrappy
for a response which they would consider effective against the broadsides
unloaded here. I too felt that when asked why I was interested in Lew's
prose. I didn't want to expose my partially developed notions to the dogs
of the net. How can we invite more varied response and still be able to
say what we want. I mean it's fine for us to say what we think, but what
about those of whom we are speaking? Jmaes

Well, of course I posted a manifesto because I wanted to flush out some
fellow spirits, not engage in debate - if I'd had a hope of that, of course
I'd have sent a longer message.
        On a list where a really dumb message about aphasia can go out
unchallenged - by people supposedly devoted to the politics of language
definition - there ain't no shared values, and there ain't no space for
civilised debate.
        I do have one civilised question: can anyone sell me a copy of
Barrett Watten's Progress? I love the library copy I have and want my own.
Is it still in print?
        A debating point, perhaps. In the American Tree is to my mind an
astounding good piece of anthology editing - a very great book. This is why
I have a lot of time for the comments Ron Silliman made on this list a
while back about laissez-faire editing in the new poetry; he has cred on the
subject. But editing is a big issue, alright: about how one looks at one's
own work, and how one allows oneself to be theorised and institutionalised -
the effort to influence this was what I love about the journals Poetic
s Journal, and indeed L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.
        So where'd it go? _From the Other Side of the Century_ is a terrible
book, in my humble opinion - everyone represented by work referring to method,
where Silliman represented writers by work either personally daring or
descriptively oor energetically activating. From the Other Side is about a
poetics as a style, a garment, a ticket to esteem, a movement got lazy, where
In The American Tree is about a movement breaking free and finding method
and setting new agendas. Well, if G1 won't keep to that spirit, G2 will,
and of course you won't like it.

The death of Eric Mottram has shocked those who knew how energetic he
was to the last week of his life. That this was so, will give pleasure
to all those who never saw him otherwise in his 40+ years as a teacher.

We will all have our particular memories. I lose count when I try to
tally up the names of writers and titles whom I first heard of from
Eric and who I cannot now imagine having "professed" American literature
without having read. How DID he find out so fast? Eric was one of the
original "networkers", who didn't need the electronic one. In fact, no
"superhighways" for Eric (though they would fascinate him as a cultural
phenomenon) - rather byways and the byways of byways, from which "probes"
he would return with gold, frankincence and a lot of less salubrious
matter. (He fell upon that McLuhan "probe" idea with a vengeance.)

I also recall telling Eric about the political machinations I was learning
about when I went to work at the Council for National Awards. We walked
endlessly up and down a tennis court at Bulmershe (as was), I think it was.
He was so distressed at what I was telling him - "the bastards! the
bastards! - that I found myself cheering HIM up. What good medicine.

I believe that King's is having a service for Eric on Friday 3 March.

*Thanks*

To Martin Spinelli for putting Senator Pressler's document before us in all
its inquisitorial splendor.  Perhaps we should be phoning his office and
working through each of the questions with *his* staff?

And also to Ted Pelton for forwarding his Jan 13 Op-Ed piece.  I am
impressed by Rep. Russ Feingold's position: he says what too few arts
advocates are willing to say.

It is true, as Ted points out, that editorials from "hometown" papers are
often entered by the Representatives into the Congressional Record as an
indication of how their constituents (are alleged to) feel.  That Bob and
Ted have both succeeded in placing their pieces is indeed encouraging.

*San Diego*

We spoke with Cole Heinowitz yesterday.  She reports that plans are
underway to invite Randy Cunningham to a "public forum" (hopefully to be
held in Escondido) on the issue of federal arts funding.  More specifics
should be available after the next planning meeting, scheduled for a week
from today.  Anne Burt of LitNet will lend some assistance on this one, and
we've tracked down some potential allies through our contacts as well.

*February Art in America*

Douglas Davis's "Multicultural Wars" is a good source for some background
on the recent history of the Endowments.  The piece is especially good at
pinpointing the flaws in the "conciliatory strategy" adopted by many arts
advocates in the past half-decade or so.  Along with the *Voice* cover
article of a week ago, this is great material to hand to someone who needs
a rapid course in the shape this battle is taking.

One snippet: "The paradox buried beneath the continuing muteness of the
mainstream liberal-left is that even today's politically fraught
contemporary art could be easily defended.  Long ago, proponents of today's
avant-gardists should have argued that this democracy, or any democracy
worth its name, thrives on dissent" (37).

*Center for the Study of Popular Culture*

The president of the above right-wing organization, Larry Jarvick, has been
participating on the "Screen" list-serv that I monitor now and then.  As
you know, Jarvick is a key member of the assassination squad being sent
after the Arts and Public Broadcasting.  If people want to appeal to
whatever reason he possesses, his e-mail address is: LAJarvick@aol.com.

*Copies of Flash Article*

We faxed off a brief article about *FE* to Joyce Jenkins at Poetry Flash
last night.  As of yet, no confirmation that it will be run, but we should
hear soon.  In the meanwhile, if anyone would like a copy, drop us a note
saying as much and we'll forward it to you via e-mail.


That's it for now.

QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE - 8-9 JULY



_WAR'S  END?_


August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how
much continued as before? What different meanings did the War's end have
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?

The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook
University, in Townsville, on 8-9 July of this year. Papers are invited
which examine the myths and realities of the War's end - especially, though
not exclusively, from the perspective of Queensland.

The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the
topic would be welcome:

* literature and the arts
* education and social policy
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities
* women's history
* military and social history
* politics and industrial relations
* journalism and the media

Venue:  Townsville, Queensland.

Date:   8-9 July, 1995.

Deadlines:
Offers of Papers:       31 March
Abstracts of Papers:     2 June

Expressions of interest should be forwarded to:

Art may be equipped to deal with "a man's total perception of relations,"
though probably not a woman's. Seriously, if you broaden the definition
of theory to encompass this most hopeful, grandiose definition of art,
then you've erased the difference between the two. Art may be able to do
what theory or philosophy or other disciplines have failed to do. That is
what Pound's statement means to me (and I don't care if that's not what
he meant).

Because that tips the balance in the direction of domination. When
explainers make such claims for their explanations, art is the loser.
This doesn't have to be so, but this is what has happened over the past
50 years or so. The framing of art has gotten increasingly more attention
than the art itself. It's gotten so people can't tell the difference any
more. They can't just bring themselves to a work of art, they're so
fascinated or intimidated by all the discourse that they've forgotten
what it's like to just let the work speak to them--that is, if they ever
knew.

Interesting point, though we all live here today, not in ancient Greece.
The opposition or at least difference between theory and practice is real
today, even if their relation was different then. Still, I do like yr
addition of a new term to this discussion. I'm all for talking about the
social conduct of writers, whether opposed to theory or not. (At the very
least, it's a good source for humor, as is demonstrated by recent
"news articles" sent to this forum.)

Folks,

Here's a letter to send to Senator Pressler of South Dakota, chair
of the Senate Commerce Committee that oversees funding to the CPB.
The language is stilted as per convention--I want his staff to read
it.  The reasoning is from the 104th Congress, cut spending--it
shows their contradiction in their own terms.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending American public broadcasting
because I think it's brilliant.  We have a long way to go before we
gain the depth and diversity of the CBC, BBC, Rai Tre, etc.  But
it's the best we've got, and if the 104th has its way there will
soon be nothing left to improve.

Download the letter.  Chop it.  Change it.  But please send it!


     --Martin Spinelli
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota
c/o U.S. Senate
Washington, D.C.  20510

Senator Pressler:

As a hard-working citizen, I am concerned about how my tax dollars
are spent.  I am even more concerned about returns on my tax
investment in the Federal Government.

I have recently read a report from the Reuter's about a letter you
sent to the heads of the CPB, NPR, and PBS asking for financial
information and predicting the inevitable commercialization of
public broadcasting.  You and your colleagues in the 104th Congress
have been spending a disconcertingly large amount of time and
resources in an attempt to convince Americans of the need to cut
this infinitesimally small budget line (much less than one one-
hundredth of one percent of the national budget) while ignoring
potentially significant cuts in budget items that are no longer
relevant or return nothing to citizens and communities.  It appears
that you are imprudently waging a costly ideological war at
taxpayers' expense, and that cultural purification is more
important to you and the new Congress than real reductions in
spending.

I have enclosed a list of questions enquiring into how you are
spending my tax money.  I would like you to answer them as soon as
possible.  I will distribute your responses to major South Dakota
newspapers, internet groups serving South Dakota, and national
media agencies.  If I receive no response from you by 25 Feb. 1995
I will report your lack of willingness to answer a citizen's
request to these media sources.

Thank you for your prompt response.


               Sincerely,




                            QUESTIONS


(Please document all responses adequately, i.e. contracts, minutes
of meetings, memos, research reports, etc.)

1.   How much of your time have you spent trying to persuade the
     American people that real budget relief could be accomplished
     if the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was cut?

     a.   What is the approximate cost to the American people of
          this expenditure of your time?

     b.   Have you ever instructed your staff, also paid with tax
          dollars, to work in advocating cuts to public
          broadcasting and at what cost to the taxpayer?

          1.)  Are you aware that the salaries of yourself and
               your staff are paid for %100 with tax-payer dollars
               while only %14 of public broadcasters' salaries are
               paid with tax money?

          2.)  Are you working %86 harder to find programs to cut
               within your own office and Congress?  If not, why
               not?

     c.   Are you aware that funding to the CPB is  only a tiny
          fraction of one percent of our national budget and
          cutting it in its entirety would do virtually nothing to
          alleviate budget pressure?  If so, why are you spending
          so much time and energy trying to convince Americans it
          should be cut for the budget's sake?

     d.   Are you intentionally misleading the American people
          about the virtually nil reduction in the budget cutting
          the CPB would cause?

2.   Please supply an itemized list of all contributions of more
     than $250 your staff has made to all political organizations
     since your election.

3.   Please supply a list of the name, religion, income and
     membership in any political extremist group (i.e. the NRA,
     Right to Life, Moral Majority, etc.) of everyone on your
     staff.

4.   Do you believe tax money should be used to defend the First
     Amendment to the Constitution?

     a.   Since public broadcasting is currently unlike commercial
          broadcasting in that is not merely billboard space for
          advertisers, how would commercial broadcasting,
          influenced and limited in form and content every ten to
          fifteen minutes by advertising, replace the unfettered
          information found on public broadcasting?

     b.   Does "balance" and "objectivity" in journalism mean that
          equal time should be given to sides of issues proven
          empirically or factually false?

          1.)  Do you agree with Newt Gingrich's former appointee
               to the position of House Historian that courses on
               the Holocaust should include space for a
               legitimation of the Nazi rationale?

          2.)  Would your definition of "balance" include giving
               equal time to Holocaust revisionists in a
               discussion of World War II, Ku Klux Klan members in
               a discussion of the Civil Rights struggle, or
               cigarette manufactures in a discussion of cancer?

     c.   Do you believe that whatever political party happens to
          be in power should be given oversight of any public
          medium?

     d.   Do you believe that completely commercial media can be
          "balanced" and "objective" even though they have to
          protect the sources of their revenue, for-profit
          corporations?

     e.   Do you believe that completely commercial media can
          report in a "balanced" fashion on things that might
          threaten their complete dominance, such as the unique
          value of public broadcasting, communication workers'
          labor talks, or the possible psychological damage or
          damage to families caused by persistent advertising?

5.   Why was your meeting with Rupert Murdoch not opened to
     reporters?

     a.   How much have Rupert Murdoch, his associates, and his
          employees donated to your political campaigns?

     b.   Has Rupert Murdoch given any financial support or other
          resources to the campaign to convince Americans that
          budget problems would experience some relief if funding
          to the CPB was cut?

     c.   Has Rupert Murdoch promised you further generosity should
          you manage to kill funding to the CPB?

     d.   Were any of your staff at the meeting with Rupert
          Murdoch?  If so, how much tax-payer money went to paying
          them while they were at the meeting?

     e.   Do you plan to meet with any other media moguls in the
          near future to discuss the selling off of public
          broadcasting bandwidths?

6.   How much time in legal council was spent writing the 170-
     question CPB demand for information and at what cost to the
     taxpayer?

          a.   How much time do you estimate CPB employees will
               now have to spend answering this request and at
               what cost to the taxpayer?

          b.   Do you feel this money was well spent?

Dear Tom, I don't doubt that you have much knowledge about spirit. We
could discuss the three kinds of spirit in the Jewish intellectual
tradition, only it would be a pretty one-sided discussion, since I don't
know that much about yr tradition. Not that I'm not interested--but a more
pertinent question might be: Why aren't Lew Daly and his fellow editors
interested?

Tom,
This isn't the Pessoa poem you referenced, but another that seems
not inappropriate:


IF THEY WANT ME TO BE A MYSTIC,
FINE.  SO I'M A MYSTIC.


If they want me to be a mystic, fine. So I'm a mystic.
I'm a mystic, but only of the body.
My soul is simple; it doesn't think.

My mysticism consists in not desiring to know,
In living without thinking about it.

I don't know what Nature is; I sing it.
I live on a hilltop
In a solitary cabin.
And that's what it's all about.

A fine questionnaire and very much to the point, but I wonder whether
letters to the leaders of the opposition pay off as much as letters to
our own representatives who may be vacillating about their constituents
commitment to responsible government. Not that I know the answer to this
question.

Subject:      "our leaders"

James,

I too am at a loss.  An exasperation compounded by feeling
like I/we have no genuine representation in Washington or
in Albany.  Even the Democrats are saying, "Sure I love All
Things Considered, sure public broadcasting is great, but
these are tough times, and that means we have to cut the
inessentials."  Our Dems in New York, following the example
of *their* Grand Poo-Bah of acquiescence Bill Clinton, have
made it impossible to articulate any possible alternative by
choosing to parrot all the erroneous assumptions of Newt and
his ilk:  you are taxed too much, government is too big,
public broadcasting is elitist/"liberal", the poor--not
decades of lunatic defense spending--are responsible for a
crushing debt, etc.  By failing to be critical of, and
actually participating in this relentless stream of
propaganda, they have made themselves part of the problem;
but they may yet keep their jobs.

I'm frustrated James.  I really don't know what to do.  You
are certainly right, Democrats do need to know that we value
public arts and public broadcasting; I've sent them a
different letter.

Feed me more ideas!

Total perception of relations implies to me, well, everything that
informs the art. Certainly I'm not arguing, and I don't believe any-
body is, that theory is somehow privileged over art, just that if it
works, use it. If it doesn't, don't. But it does have some relevance
to the creation of art? Are we  genuinely saying that a poet's
aesthetics, politics, economics, etc., don't inform the poem? Not
that it should be mistaken for the poem, okay, but does it come from
nowhere? That's all I'm asking, really, when I talk about the relations
thing.
     I am interested, though, in the desire to keep poetry pure, clean
of theory....
     Listen, this is not an academic problem. This is a problem I face
everyday when as I sit at my desk and my ideals about what poetry
should be increasingly diverge with what I'm writing and I struggle
to come to some resolution that never happens because it can't and
that's what, to me, is interesting about writing. That I never write
what I set out to write and am constantly surprised.
     So this question is very important to me and why I've been following
the discussion with great interest at what I see as very important POVs
are articulated. Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

         BOULDER, COLO. (AHP) -- A rumor long circulated through
 the city was finally confirmed today as Poetics Police disclosed
 their raid on a local religious school's ``Sapphic hierarchy.''
         The p-cops moved quickly, seizing documents and arresting
 ringleaders. More specific details were not available at press
 time.
         Chief among the questions was just what a ``Sapphic
 hierarchy'' might be.
         Following the announcement, Boulder's Naropa Institute,
 the nation's first accredited Buddhist college, announced a
 severing of all ties with the famed Jack Kerouac School of
 Disembodied Poetics.

         Naropa's Board of Trustees insisted the decision had been
 made before the raid.
         The school's poetics program had long drawn criticism, but
 Naropa ignored the warnings, in part because of the stature of the
 Kerouac school, and partly because the poetry helped fund other
 programs.
         Named for famed alcoholic writer Jack Kerouac, the poetics
 program has long attracted a wide variety of writers committed to the
 school's permissive philosophy and multicultural agenda. Kerouac
 is principally remembered for inspiring the TV series Route 66.
         A Buddhist official speaking on condition of anonymity noted,
 ``Other colleges have football and basketball, we have poets ... and
 you know what trouble poets are.''
         Anne Waldman, co-founder of the program, is suspected
 of organizing the Sapphists. Led away for questioning with colleague
 Andrew Schelling, she reportedly shouted, ``Yes! We're sure that
 some of our students have sex, sometimes with each other, it's good
 for them!''
         Poet Jack Collom, called for a comment, said only, ``I don't

 know a thing. I was out with the boys shootin' pool and on my way
 home.''
         Waldman's intern, Katie Yates, had just returned from a
 month-long meditation retreat. ``Great, just great,'' she told
 reporters, ``I go away for a few weeks and the whole thing falls
 apart ... maybe I'll go back to Albany.''
         Followers of Naropa's history will recall earlier scandals.
 In the late 1970s, students were required to pose nude for photographs
 supposedly used in a study of meditation posture.
         Neighborhood residents are determined to see an end put to
 this controversial institution. Says Naropa neighbor Ni Kegap, ``I
 don't mind the all night partyin' ... it's those endless `oms' ... it
 just gets ugly after awhile ... they call it poetry but it doesn't
 rhyme and it doesn't make sense.''
         A shaken Peter Lamborn Wilson appeared on the front steps of
 the school to quiet an angry crowd. ``Why can't we all just get along?''
 wailed the normally mild-mannered Sufist.
         A tense moment occurred when players from the University of
 Colorado football team, which practices nearby, began heckling.

Subject:      Cockney Rhyming of the m . . .

Hi Ron and Chris.

Briefly, Kacky pataki is Hackney rhyming slang for Karnaki - a form of fast
interlocking group guttural vocal music produced in the Belo-sur-Tsiribina
(meaning Place Where One Must Not Dive) area of west coastal Madagascar. It
sounds like Ketjak when described like that I know. I went there last year
and recorded some. Does that mean that we have something in common?

I beg to differ though.

In actual fact Lowkey Bloakey (well I knew you wouldn't believe me so I had
to seed you into reading this far before I told the truth) is Cockney
rhyming slang for Okey-Dokey  -  a form of self-defense through
amelioration practiced, mainly by men, and only in London's East End. These
days of course the 'happy chappy'is mostly used as a sweetener for
community theatre workshops. It's apparently so named after the classic
fence-sitting posture advocated by Mathew Arnold in 1849 when writing to
fellow poet Clough of the need:

'to begin with an idea of the world in order not to be prevailed over by
the world's multitudinousness'

a mantis which afflicts English poetry and its translations nay even unto
this very day.
Coherence is its essence.
I haven't seen the apex yet that didn't harbour such.

You're probably both right.

Hi. I've called for a decisive break with the past too. I tried to post it
once before and only managed to preface an ammendment. And now I'm here as
it were simply hoping to be present enough when one of these breaks with
the past does call by as to attempt to either engage or represent its
interests.
This is a call for FAT TIME. Engagement with or without of the blah blah.
ALERT BREATH.

'The Return of The Plague of The Dreams of The Undecided'.

Ira raises issues of improvisation, of music, of body and voice  -  amongst
(or between) others. Improvisation is the salt (Fame Is Not The Spur) of
process to the materials of composition.
Improvisation is not 'free' and they who suggest that it can be are spent.
But I wouldn't suggest that the dues are what have to be paid for. Down
traits of avoidance have developed which are certain  -  as to flurry with
an -all-too-frequency mode of anxiety. Who Goes There Perimeters are the
familiar policed.

Recognisable slack has evolved through imitation of previously incisive
strategies. Impro and Lang-po share the worst burden of flattery - as
urgency worn second-hand. Many will have their own catelogues of denial in
these respects.

When Robert Grenier wrote "I HATE SPEECH" (his shout not mine) did he
understand the irony that language writers would 'find' their voices by
such turns?
Impacting tectonics of playful curiosity, rigorous enquiry and specific
discovery onto the dominant familial nodes of poetic formulation and
circulation. Again paralleels (sic) with Impro. Now some 20 years on.
Hardly surprising and highly desirable that impetus for re-alignment has
come.

Chance overcharacterised into exquisitely interfastening rather than
threatening difference  -  sorry, deference.

And then becomes political

sufficiently long as to be impressed on the minds of they who are cast as
spectators -  and a bright-eyed horde quietly transporting the gates to

Subject:      Espousing 2/8

Before proceeding with this update (dealing mostly with legislative matters
and the questions Martin Spinelli and James Sherry raised today about where
to direct one's energies), I want to pose an open question to members of
this list: would you (pl.) prefer that such postings migrate off-list or is
it useful to have them appear here?

The Poetics-list was an invaluable resource in the first rush of organizing
*FE*, but as we settle into the weeks and months of ongoing activity, we
are wary of trying the patience of those who don't much care about this
particular struggle (perhaps especially those who log-in from non-U.S.
sites).  We could easily enough shift to cc-trees if continued use of this
space doesn't seem appropriate.

Jen and I will make a decision about this in the next week or two, based on
whether any consensus emerges one way or the other on the list (though that
would be a rare occasion).  So let's hear it.

*Who to Write: Dem or Them?*

James Sherry wondered this morning (with reference to Martin Spinelli's
wonderful retort to Pressler) "whether letters to the leaders of the
opposition pay off as much as letters to our own representatives who may be
vacillating about their constituents commitment to responsible government.
Not that I know the answer to this question."

I don't know the answer either, but I have been repeatedly told that even
with consolidated support from Democrats, the NEA is extremely vulnerable.
As Patrick A. Trueman (how do they all end up with names like that?) of the
conservative Christian "American Family Association" told a reporter: "Of
the 73 new Republican freshmen...probably 65 of them oppose NEA funding
altogether" ("Opposing Interests Brace for a Culture Clash," by Jon Healey,
_Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report_, 28 Jan 1995).

The reporter goes on to cite two amendments proposed in 1994, one to
eliminate NEA funding (105 votes short of passage) and one to slash its
budget by 54% (86 votes short).  Even allowing for the fact that Trueman is
bragging,the post-Coup margin has become distressingly slim.

The question is, as I think Ron pointed out vis-a-vis "Duke" in
Escondido--how to make it *cost* these folks something if they oppose the
NEA? Right now they just see *profits* (both symbolic and material) galore.
There's little leverage given the current composition of the Congress, but
the low voter turnout which is the dirty secret behind the so-called GOP
"Mandate" makes 1996 a specter perhaps worth invoking.  It's just a
thought, and one predicated on the assumption (totally unproven) that the
Backlash will itself produce the conditions for its own electoral demise in
the next 18 months.

*Wesleyan begins to organize*

We got a call today from an undergraduate (Sr.) at Wesleyan who is just
beginning to organize an event for Febrary 16th.  Anyone with contacts in
the writing scene on/around that campus is welcome to forward tips to him
through us.  Right now it looks as though the format will be a tight
two-hour program of talks.

Subject:      PRESSLER QUESTIONNAIRE

        As they say on the FAN, I'm a first-time caller. Actually, I've only
been on this list (& the internet) for a few weeks, and hadn't yet put in my
two dimes' worth, both because of work deadlines and because I hadn't yet
figured out how.  Thought I'd take the time & energy to figure this listserv
mechanism out now, out of a feeling that activists who are doing great work
can always use a few words of thanks & support when they express feelings of
exasperation.
        In response to Martin Spinelli, who wrote, "I too am at a loss.  An
exasperation compounded by feeling like I/we have no genuine representation
in Washington or
in Albany,"  I'd like to offer support & thanks for coming up with such an
imaginative & inspiring tactic--the questionnaire to Pressler.  (Actually,
I've been totally impressed with all the great organizing work being done by
dozens of you on this list around the NEA and CPB issues.)
        Re Martin's questions, it's a tough political & strategic question to
figure out how best challenge both Republicans' Contract on America and
Democrats' continuing shift to the right. In the long term, I think, it's
going to take new progressive movement-building, both to pressure the
potentially progressive Democrats into shifting toward the truly-democratic
left and also to develop new alternative vehicles that are capable of winning
more than once in a while. And I think we need *multi-issue* vehicles, since
it *can* get pretty frustrating trying to fight these battles one
issue/crisis at a time. (One of my main political projects these days is a
New Jersey welfare rights group, called Solutions to End Poverty--welfare
another topic on which both alleged-Republicans and so-called Democrats--esp.
under Clinton--are pretty horrible.) Actually, I really think we need to help
build a new third party, but that's a topic best left for another sleepless
early morning. Meanwhile, we're left with this one-issue-at-a-time
crisis-mode organizing, in which we can only do the best we can, as we
simultaneously try to defeat the Republicans and try as much as possible to
remove the new elephant snouts on the members of the donkey party. And Martin
and others:  please know that there are those of us out here listening and
inspired--and, incidentally, sending out postcards--by your hard & creative
work.
        By the way, have you contacted press (both major media & alternative
media like Pacifica) with copies of your questionnaire to Pressler? I didn't
see mention of that in your original note. Maybe having a poetry group
calling a press conference with that questionnaire as a centerpiece?  It's so
imaginative I think media might pick it up & add to the pressure on Pressler
(who, by the way, I've heard has already withdrawn some of his most intrusive
questions to the CPB). Also, maybe send copies of questionnaire to other
activist groups working on additional aspects of the Contract on America, to
start building long-term alliances?
        In closing, quite an interesting basketball game down here in Central
Jersey tonight, between Rutgers & University of Massachusetts, whose unusual
half-time showstopper demonstration helps maintain my hope in young people's
political determination and willingness to act. Thanks again. Sincerely,
Eliot Katz

Thank you for your work in this arena. Readers can now find their
books with the EPC search function. I hope that readers who don't have

Seeing the issues raised on the server has a specific use to me in that I
wonder what "poetic" issues are more primary. Granted this is an issue of
organizing, but organizing is also the work of getting the right words
together.

Steve & Jen,

My vote too is for you to continue posting the news.  Though I am one
of the mostly silent ones on the net (principally due to the demands
of my administrative office job), I often do end up forwarding
pertinent info to various friends & activists.  The questionairre to
Pressler is, for example, a gem.  We will have a NPR rep on campus
later in the week, & she may be interested in some of what's going
on.  I also am in touch with one of our senator's legislative aides,
and info provided through this discussion group has been very
helpful.

Every "poem" (every "fact" in fact) is imbued with and attached to a
theoretical structure which both informs it and from which it does not
separate except in the minds of those who would create a transparent
simulacrum of reality where the pure is real. Fortunately these isolated
realities are fiction although some use the possibility ot inform their
misguided politics. We have poetries which are embossed with their
cultures and some readers and even some writers pretend not to see that.
Thoughts are not purer than bodies and poems are the products of both and
as such do not exist in isolation, nor can they be distilled into a
spirit, although some use the possibility to inform their misguided
poetics. James

To clarify the off-list alternative mentioned in Espousing Update 2/8: what
we would do is build a group of names/e-addresses to be reached through the
"cc" (copy to) function on our Eudora software.  Awkwardly large "headers"
are the downside of this option.

         WASHINGTON (AHP) -- Leaders of the Association of Poets
 in Retirement aren't quite sure what Apex Speaker Lew Daly has
 in mind with his call for rethinking Poeticare ``from the ground
 up.'' But what they've heard worries them.
         ``The speaker's proposal left me fully depressed,'' said
 Rae Armantrout of San Diego, Calif., a member of the APR's council
 of outspoken elders. ``He wants to scuttle Poeticare with some weasel
 words -- `radical transparency'.''
         Other APR officials are more circumspect, but they, too,
 express anxiety.
         Anselm Hollo of Boulder, Colo., a retired punster and part-time
 versifier, said, ``Anytime you destroy something and you build from
 the ground up ... you're in trouble because you may lose some of the

 good parts.''
         ``I'm not saying Poeticare shouldn't be looked at and
 modifications shouldn't be made,'' added Hollo, chairman of
 Numerous Adequate Poets (NAP), which helps shape policy for the
 G1-endorsed APR.
         Poeticare is the shoe that hasn't dropped in the newly
 empowered ``Spirit'' majority's agenda for sweeping change.
         With Small Press Publishing still accorded sacred cow
 status by both parties, the costly Poeticare program is among the
 biggest and most tempting targets for title-trimmers and word-cutters.
         Daly called yesterday for a top-to-bottom review of Poeticare
 and its ``highly centralized bureaucratic structure offering one
 menu for everybody in a monopolistic manner.'' He appealed to G1
 writers to help poeticians think through ``how we get to a better
 Poeticare system that actually works more extensively, that gives
 greater choices, and that is also socially more honest.''
         He said later that the older poets should be able to join
 Happening Movements and Organizations (HMOs) to extend their
 careers, and use archive sales or choose other methods for

 attracting attention to their work.
         While 10 percent of the G1 poets are enrolled voluntarily
 in HMOs, Poeticare remains a bastion of fee-for-service poetry.
 Individual arts organizations set fees for readings and regulate
 schedules, but the poets can utilize any series they wish, so long
 as the organization is willing to accept them.
         Jean Day, a retired G1 poet who spent her career as top
 manager of Small Press Distribution, likes the old system. ``I want
 fee for service (poetry). I want to be able to set my own agenda.''
         But most younger poets now are in some form of managed care.
 If they want unrestricted access to readings and publishing, they
 have to pay more for it. State-funded Poetics Programs are rushing to
 push Poeticaid recipients -- the poor and the socially needy -- into
 managed care.
         A year ago, the APR looked to special issues of literary
 journals as a path for literary reform. That never materialized.
         Now it is girding for a fight just to protect what they have,
 despite President Bernstein's plea in last week's State of the Art
 address not to tap Poeticare to pay for G2's ``Contract with America.''

         ``There are things in the Poeticare system that clearly need
 work,'' said Jerry Rothenberg, the APR's executive director. ``I
 don't think Poeticare is going to remain the way it is forever, or
 that HMOs are going to sweep the nation.''
         Sen. Juliana Spahr, Spir.-N.Y, reminded ``Lang-Po'' leaders
 that the Poeticare trust fund will go broke in seven years. ``We
 can't say something is off the board and is untouchable,'' said the
 Poetics Program's Labor and Human Resources Committee chair.
         She suggested that options for dealing with Poeticare's
 woes include basing Poeticare benefits on financial need and moving
 more of the G1 writers toward managed care.
         Daly and the chairpersons of the Apex Ways and Means and
 Commerce committees all support the idea of letting people spend
 their words crit-free to help accumulate intellectual capital.
         Bill Howe, policy director of the Center for the Study of
 Accelerated Aesthetics in Austin, said poetry IRAs have the potential
 to ``lead to a radical restructuring of the poetry world'' as
 writers gain more control over their career insurance dollars.

RE: CPB Funding - On Line Tool Available Now

A new tool is available now to help us communicate with listeners about
the funding situation in Washington.
        You have no doubt heard about the discussions in Washington to
        eliminate funding for public broadcasting.  Action is needed now.
        To voice your support for continued funding of public radio, send an
        e-mail to pub hyphen broad at american dot edu.  Information will be
        e-mailed back to you on how to make your voice heard in Washington.
        That's pub hyphen broad at american dot edu.("pub-broad@american.edu")
        Now more than ever, it's critical to make your support of public radio
        known.
        Thank you.

Public Radio International (PRI) and "Soundprint" have collaborated to
create an automatic e-mail system that will provide listeners the
information needed to create letters to congress.

This Internet project builds on the capacities of the Soundprint Media
Center and is 100% privately funded.  Here is how it works.

Listeners can send e-mail to the address
"pub-broad@american.edu."
A computer will field these messages and automatically send the listener
back instructions on how to voice their support for public broadcasting in
Washington.  Listeners will receive a thank you, instructions, a list of
congressional and house addresses (regular and e-mail),
phone numbers and sample talking points for a letter.

The instructions will encourage letters first, calls second and e-mail
last.
The need for quick action and personal stories will be highlighted.
Listeners are warned NOT to simply forward the e-mail they get to
Washington.

This service will be in place for 90 days - through April 30, 1995.  It may
be extended at any time.

If you use the "bcc" function you don't get large "headers" (or at least I

Subject:      Freely Espousing

As one of the non U.S. sites on this list I'm all for keeping the freely
espousing posting here too.

The specifics of your struggle differ, yet:-

I was directly involved in events at The Poetry Society in London 1977
through which petit bourgeouis bureaucrats and 'least line of resistance'
cultural tsars hid under the skirts of an enquiry by a member of the House
of Lords (Sir John Witt) designed in the words of Eric Mottram to finger
the transatlantic influence of 'foreign poets' as 'a treacherous assault on
British poetry'. This happened here under a Labour Government of MPs
running ('three wheels on my wagon') scared towards re-election with the
spectre of Thacherism blooming marge. The outcome effectively and
resolutely closed the door on linguistically innovative poetries here,
whether produced within Britain or abroad. The result  -  a lasting
internal exile for several poets and a blinkered (or bycycle clipped)
retrenchment into Little England for poetry (period) in these countries.
The waters closed over so quickly as to enable Donald Hall to write in 1979
that 'the poetries of England and America have become discontinuous'.

We abandoned the site of conflict in disgust and distaste, we resigned and
opted for forms resistance which have yet to impinge sufficiently
exquisitely onto the rewritten agenda as to need to be addressed. A recent
crop of ironic Mottram obituaries in the national press revisit such sites
by calling him perhaps the best known of the "unknown poets" here. I can
still remember, with a chill, Lee Harwood being surprised that the powers
of reaction within the British establishment didn't behave 'like
gentlemen'. As a pre-phrasing of the words of Martin Spinelli on this list
(6/2/95) we sat by and shrugged and we got what we deserved.

The parellels don't seem too slender. I hope you don't berate these
observations from afar.

The sites of the formations of pernicious National and Cultural Identities
are still sign and syntax. Prevent the hardening of the arteries within and
without of the body-politic by intensifying engagement at those sites.

Pressler sure knows what he's doing. From this distance, through networks
such as Freely Espousing, it seems that there is an ability to respond
being nurtured - a movement encouraged.

I for one value that activity AS the poetry.

thanks, cris

whether the structure that initiates those acts of difference is worth retaining
spite of the fact that it is always going to be imperfect according to any set o
one might want to place alongside it. From here, it seems to me that the NEA
discussion is absolutely appropriate, and already within those earlier posts in
which questions were being (properly) asked about being a writer/being a citizen
and is there any connection between them. So, I don't really think that my
geographical distance from the location of the discussion can get to define
how the discussion actually impinges upon my 'location' in the world, any more
really than being across the other side the world from Bosnia or Northern Irelan
does. Anything that can happen there can happen here. If it comes to one's
notice, then it's there for one's noticing etc etc. Best wishes to all, Alan Lon

Dear James,

I never said anything about "purity," nor did I say art does not reflect
theory (along with all those other relations?) in some way. What I've
been saying, or trying to say, is that art and theory are on different
levels.

In so far as it is a reply to me, your statement seems based upon
exaggerating or misunderstanding what I have said, so that you can attack
this transparent simulacrum strawman of yours. Again, I do not believe
that art is pure. I'm not sure I believe that anything in our human world
is pure. What I believe is that art and theory (or philosophy or politics
or...) are not the same thing, that they are not on the same level. The
figure of separate levels does not mean the levels are hermetically
sealed from each other. I think it's interesting and maybe revealing
that you (and in a different way, Eric) would assume or conclude this.

Whatever that might mean, I don't have a need to get carried away with
it. I'm inclined to think this is more than just an innocent
misunderstanding between us, but I could be wrong.

In the spirit of avoiding a contentious fight, I would like to add that
I've been mulling over yr point about doxa ever since I read it and made
my quick reply. The more I think about it the more I think it is quite
relevant to our world here today. So I'm sorry if my response appeared to
express more disagreement than appreciation for this thought.

It may be that a significant opposition lurking beneath this discussion
(and many others) is doxa. If so I wonder, how are we to distinguish this
doxa from what it opposes?

Dear Eric,

Those who have a big investment in theory may be prejudiced in
a direction which will impair their judgment about what does and doesn't
work when it comes to creating or appreciating art. As I told James, I'm
not advocating purity. The fact that you both think I am might indicate
that you both have trouble stepping back from the discourse, that it's
hard for you to hear someone who is simply saying art must have its level.

Of course art doesn't come from nowhere. And of course it is inevitable
that there will be all kinds of influences upon this art. To me this means
we can free up our process as much as we see fit. A successful process is
one that allows these influences to happen as they may, or as they may
not. The guiding principle is whatever transports the work in and of
itself. This will not happen if external influences or conscious
intentions are too strong. This to me is the same as saying that art must
be on its own level. This does not mean it's sealed off from anything.

Excuse me if I sound "misguided" (misguided? isn't that something that
happens to lapsed catholics and neo-post-trots?), but I'm having a
hard time with this. My (misguided?) understanding of "theories" is
that people make them up to explain things. Hence the etymologiocal
derivation from that whole Greek specular trip: to see (what's
"behind" the veil). Mr. Sherry's formulation seems to imply that people
write poems based on theories, rather than writing theories based on
poems. This may be the way "Language poets" do it, but it hardly seems
a necessary relation. Perhaps there's a confusion here between
"theory" and "cosmology".

Best,
Mike

I would agree that Mr. Sherry seems to be arguing a chicken before the egg
thing.  However, it's hard for me to really figure out which one comes first.
 I tend to side with the egg (poetry) these days, but I know from experience
that I was only able to write what I consider *decent* work after I learned
something about social theory and the history of art.  I was basically a
scientist until age 25, when I met Steve Evans and Jennifer Moxley.  They
showed me society.  They showed me art.

I would be interested to hear James talk out how he and others in the late
70's-early 80's *decided* to write Lang-Po.  Did it come from Zukofsky,
Barthes and Althusser?  Did it come from a hatred of that Deer poem by
Richard Wilbur (?) where he thinks hard for us all?  Did it come consciously?
 Did it come from the radio?  Did he just do it?

The problem I feel now (at 35) though is that theory is getting in the way of
creation.  I worry too much about correctness, politcal, avante-garde, et al,
to really create something interesting that isn't just a rehash of something
I just did or someone else just did.  Maybe it's just a case of the
composition blues.  I remember my composition teachers telling me that there
were two steps to writing a paper:  free writing / brainstorming and editing
/ revising.  The two functions are supposedly controlled by different parts
of the brain.

I'm hinting at community formation as the bridge between theory and practice.
 Anyone want to play poker on Sun night?

Spencer's recent postings on the "level" of art reminded me of Oppen's lines
from "Of Being Numerous":

One must not come to feel that he [sic] has a thousand threads in his hands,
He must somehow see the one thing; This is the level of art There are other
levels But there is no other level of art

In a reading late in life (I think NY, 1979, but I'm not positive) he reads
this last line as "But this is the level of art."

As regards George Bowering's locating of the Pessoa-in-translation line as
"What's it all about, Alfredo"--so we've traded the Hokey Pokey for "What's It
All About, Alfie" now?

Little Bob, my favorite frog worterbuch tells me that the _other_
meaning of the word "theorie",in  French,  via Greek "theo^ria"
(procession) refers to a delegation of people sent by a city to a
sacred occasion or to a great temple. By extension (1907) it came to
mean "groups of people walking one behind the other." (Camus, for ex.,
has "des theories de femmes"). On the other hand, walking in a single
line will be given by my dictionaire allemand as "im Gansemarch," i.e.
goose-stepping.

          LONDON (AHP) - Some 10 or 15 rare birds died last night
 in a Cambridge fire while their keeper was on a drinking binge
 to celebrate being named Poet Laureate to the English Crown.
          The fire, which broke out shortly after midnight in Gonville
 and Caius, raged through a shelter for rare breeds of swans, guinea
 fowl and peacocks for more than an hour before sleeping cricket
 players at a nearby college called the porter.
          ``The firemen said they came across the keeper staggering
 around his room,'' remarked the porter. ``Earlier that same day
 he had been heard shouting `I am Prin ... Prince Jay-Re-Me!' to no
 one in particular.''
          No birds survived the blaze.

Each poem has a theoretical basis whether it is acknowledged or not.

Alas, Bill I cannot show how anyone "decided" to write Lang-Po, since it
was not decided and was not written. It has been perceived as having been
written by those who wish to oversimplify the realities of what was
written during that period down to this. Get a little subtle, please. Jmeas

Pierre, am I reading you right? Re -    every poem is a theory.
Is it a pate and Golden Egg question you're raising?

Or am I being cast (as Virgil saw himself ironically)
'to be a goose honking amongst tuneful swans'?

Isn't Poetry inclusive of both speculation and practice - rather than
practice  opposing  speculation?
Melody  -  Rhythm  and  Noise?

Pierre, I'm pretty tired and just typed poverty instead of poetry.
Surely the One is sufficiently respectful of an Other as to not go walking

I'm new to this space and am just realising its economy.

Well, I have never heard of "Hokey Cokey". It was "Hokey Pokey" a
half century ago. And I have never heard of Pokey flavour ice cream.
Maybe that is a New Zealand flavour. Derived from lanolin, maybe? I
will be in Aukland tomorrow, and try to find some Pokey ice cream.

But we remember that Paul liked a lively English version of

Well, there is 'New Zealand Ice Cream Company' shop in my local shopping
centre and they have Hokey Pokey flavour. However there is a US based
icecream/frozen yought company (Rollins? I can remeber its name) in
Paddington and they have a flavour called "the orginal Hokey Pokey ice
cream".

Spencer, I hear you. I really do, but I must ask finally, what is your
definition of theory? It seems as if James and I are using a definition
that calls for contextualization, and frankly, I think youre idea of
theory is these names which form the heading for the discussion that,
and I agree with you wholeheartedly, has gone on far too long.
     Art does have its level. I agree. But it also has a context,
which I will call theoretical, and it is an act of violence that
Shelley, Milton, Pound and even that most unintellectual of intellectual
poets, O'Hara, would perhaps resent, to rip it from that context.
     My thing about purity was simply that it didn't seem to me that
what we were saying here, or more precisely what Tom and others
were saying since I did indeed butt-in, was all that "radical"
or even particularly "theoretical." It just seemed sensible to me
and I wondered why it bothered you. That's all.
     As for the academy: You scored a hit. I'm an academic, or a wanna
be academic which shows you already the fool you're dealing with here,
and I certainly have an interest in "complexifying matters." But, I'm
a lot of other things too. None of which I can, or want, to seperate
from my work, admittedly limited though it is.
     I think a lot of important issues are coming up. I think the reason
we are not any closer to resolving them (and by the way I give you
a great deal of credit personally Spencer for having the stamina to take
on all comers) is that they cannot be resolved. I think it is from these
tensions that the best work comes.
     Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

Thanks to everyone who voiced an opinion on whether these updates should
continue landing on the poetics-list.  The current vote (including some
back-channel communications) stands at 15-2 for continuing here.  We've
also gotten some good advice about how else to use the Net (especially from
Sandra Braman).  More as that develops.

What follows is an especially long update (if you read nothing else, do at
least check out "National Security Concerns," where a Jack Collum poem is
credited with directly undermining the nation's armed services).

We'll probably be off-line now until early next week as we travel to NYC
for Jennifer's reading with Bill Luoma on Saturday at the Ear and Rae
Armantrout/Lisa Jarnot/Lee Ann Brown's reading at Segue on Sunday.  So:
Good luck to Bob, Susan, and Gil in Philadelphia on Saturday!

*National Security Concerns*

The 7 February Congressional Record notes the following exchange between
Georgia Republican Jack Kingston and Duncan Hunter (R-California):

"Mr. Kingston: It is interesting, everybody does like to jump on the
Pentagon, wasteful spending and talk about the $400 toilet seat and $200
hammer and so forth.  We want to know about these things.  We want to
ferret it out.  We think that is what the mission is about, defense of the
country, survival of the country, and protecting your son or your daugher
who may need to have the most high-technology airplane or tank or ship or
whatever.

Here is something that we, as taxpayers, your taxpayers in Californian and
mine in Georgia, $30,000 on this poem.  I am going to read this to you.

'Suddenly, masked hombres seized Petunia pig and made her into a sort of
dense Jello.  Somehow the texture, out of nowhere, produces a species of
Atavistic anomie, a melancholy memory of good food.'

It was written by Jack Collom of Boulder, Co.  The National Endowment for
the Arts awared $30,000 for that poem.

And yet we are telling our American service personnel that they cannot get
a raise.  We are rolling the COLA's of veterans so that they cannot get
what we contractually obligated to them.

I have met in Hinesville, GA, service personnel who can qualify for food
stamps and other public assistance benefits.  Some of them are taking them,
some are not.  But it is very hard to tell somebody who is on his way to
Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, wherever, we have got $30,000 for poems like this
and your tax dollars are paying for it.  I think one of the things that we
are about in the Congress right now is to go back and try to find things
like this so we can spend our dollars smarter, cut where we need to.  But
where we are going to spend, let us spend appropriately.

Mr. Hunter:  I think the description of the expenditures that were made by
the National Endowment for the Arts are one thing that would lower the
morale of our service people if they knew that that was keeping them from
having a higher quality of life."

(Congressional Record, 7 Feb 95:  H1360.  The CR for 7 Feb also records
some remarks, made in the context of the Balanced Budget Amendment debate,
by Arkansas Democratic Senator Dale Bumpers that are strongly CPB/NEA/NEH.
Cf. S2243.)


*HR 579*

Another sponsor has added their name to Hefley's bill (The 'Privatization
of Humanities Act,'): California Republican Dana Rohrabacher (2-8-95).

*House Subcommittee Timeline*

When I spoke to the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families
yesterday, I was told that nothing pertaining to the NEA/NEH will be
considered within the next two weeks.  You can call 1-202-226-2026 for
recorded information about the SubCom's schedule (release one week at a
time I believe).

*Back on 1/25*

Speaking with CD Wright (who was instrumental in organizing FE-Providence)
over the past two days, I realize that we never mentioned an event that
took place in Wilmington NC on 25 January.  Through the help of Deborah
Luster (a photographer) and Michael Luster (a folklorist), an
already-scheduled reading by Mark Strand was linked to *FE* and to the
defense of federal arts funding more generally.  CD reports that 800 people
attended that reading.  Strand apparently addressed the crisis and tons of
LitNet postcard-kits and other valuable information was distributed.


*Wesleyan Contact*

I omitted AJ Weissbard's name from yesterday's update about plans for a Feb
16th event at Wesleyan.  Speakers will likely include RISD President (and
*FE* 1/28 alum) Roger Mandle and George White of the Eugene O'Neill
Theater.  White is also one of three people behind "Americans United to
Save the Arts and Humanities," which--from what we gather--targets the
wealthier Arts advocates ($1,000 is the ante they're asking from their
supporters).

*Christian Coalition*

A report on the Christian Coalition, posted to various lists in the past
few weeks, just reached us.  The report originated with Amy T. Goodloe
(agoodloe@netcom.com).  We reproduce it here.

Dear Alan,
Thank you for your post on Oppen. I hadn't connected my
statements to him (or anyone else) consciously. But it's nice to know, or
be reminded, that someone of his importance had a view of art which is
similar to mine. It seems to me that my position is somewhat basic. Not
that I think everyone will or could agree with me. Since I have made most
of my statements in dissent, I could hardly think that. But I do believe
that I am not the only one who has been bothered by the dominance of some
who hold differing views.

I agree that every poem (and work of art) may be viewed as a theory.
Considering my recent statements, it may come as no surprise that I trust
this form of theory the most.

This sounds a bit like There is a God whether He is acknowledged or
not. Amen. (Yikes! Shades of the M'ers creeping into the L-space.) It
does make it kind of hard to have a conversation, though, when one
side knows the truth. Or is all that just a theory you made up?

        Fully feel that pain
        Not that doubled pain, not his
        But another he never had.

        So, round on its tracks
        It goes, to entertain the reason,
        This little train, all wound-up
        We call the heart.

The poem is called Autopsicografia.

Ron,
        Honig is not very good, it's true. A later edition of
his Pessoa selected involves another translation (whose name,
I don't recall), and she's not much of an improvement. Tehre's
a small volume by James Greene and Clara de Azevado Mafra, but
it suffers from Greene's usual lugubrious _sensitivity_. Jonathon
Griffin has done some Pessoa quite well, yet, published in
England, these are not always easily available, tho I think
SPD carries something.
        A young poet and translator, Richard Zenith, an American
living in Lisbon, has done some much better Pessoa; in particular
_The Book of Disquiet_ - the long prose _meditation_ by P.'s
semi-heteronym whose moniker I can't recall (i.e. not Reis,
Caiero or de Campos). Again, not widely available.

Re: James Sherry's:

"Every "poem" (every "fact" in fact) is imbued with and attached to a
theoretical structure which both informs it and from which it does not
separate except in the minds of those who would create a transparent
simulacrum of reality where the pure is real. Fortunately these isolated
realities are fiction although some use the possibility ot inform their
misguided politics. We have poetries which are embossed with their
cultures and some readers and even some writers pretend not to see that.
Thoughts are not purer than bodies and poems are the products of both and
as such do not exist in isolation, nor can they be distilled into a
spirit, although some use the possibility to inform their misguided
poetics."

True words, and I'd like to hear more. What James calls a "theoretical
structure," does he (do you) mean at once a cultural structure (simply,
you cannot separate e.g. Pessoa from the dying Portugese ex-colonial
culture), inasmuch as (obviously) everyone inhabits a culture and com-
plexly writes within it, and (also at once) an ideological structure?
Do all poets write, on the other hand, from within an ideology? Or
maybe that's better put, are all cultures ideological?

Also, the following phrases in James contribution above; "a theoretical
structure which both informs it and from which it does not separate,"
now there's a further claim, and one which is interesting, radical, and
with which I think I might disagree, tho I'm not sure we'd be meaning
the same thing. In other words, is there no sense in which a work
departs its origins? A person, does a person depart his/her origins?
How does culture change, in other words? And, do poets have a function
in that change? (e.g. Pessoa took that milieu and moved it somewhere,
in his work, and, by intention and influence, in his readers)

I'm interested in these questions.

"CONTRACT WITH AMERICA" VS. THE ARTS

 U.S. House Speaker Gingrich and his allies have made clear in the first
 days of the 104th Congress their intention to zero-out funding for
 federally-supported cultural programs.  It is likely to prove a long and
 protracted battle, with the greatest threat to the National Endowment for
 the Arts (NEA),  the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the
 Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) coming from attempts to pass the
 "Contract with America."  In order to finance the tax cuts proposed in the
 "Contract, " House Speaker Gingrich has recommended slashing funding for
 the arts, humanities and public broadcasting.

 According to a recent action alert circulated by People for the American
 Way, cultural funding is not simply being targeted as part of an effort to
 balance the budget, but it is part of a political payback to the Religious
 Right for their support in last November's election.  People For asserts
 that the call for defunding the cultural agencies is ideological, that
 these agencies have for several years now been under attack for funding
 works which the Religious Right finds objectionable and that this latest
 assault is merely a new packaging of the same agenda, aimed at achieving
 the same end -- the silencing of those voices the Far Right finds
 objectionable.

 The legislative battle will take place over a series of months during the
 first half of 1995, with critical votes taking place in several different
 committees, as well as on the floor of the House and Senate.  According to
 People For the American Way, political pressure from the grassroots must
 begin immediately, otherwise the arts may not make it to the second round
 of this fight.  House Speaker Gingrich's pledge to consider the "Contract"
 in the first hundred days is is being understood by arts advocates
 nationwide to mean that a Budget Committee proposal will make its way to
 the floor of the House of Representatives by late March or early April.
 Sources suggest that efforts to eliminate cultural funding are likely to be
 incremental, with a multi-year phasing out of federal support for NEA, NEH
 and CPB.

 Soon after Congress takes action on the "Contract," the House of
 Representatives will begin its annual appropriations process.  As
 the Appropriations Committee considers funding levels for the NEA, NEH
 and CPB,
 they are expected to be urged by Republican leadership to recommend funding
 amounts which reflect the "Contract."  The House Appropriations Bill will
 make its way to the House floor by mid-summer, with the Senate following
 suit in late summer or early fall.  In addition to providing funding for
 the three agencies, this year Congress must also reauthorize the NEA,
NEH and
 CPB.   Both House Appropriations Chair Livingston (R-LA) and Senate
 Appropriations Chair Hatfield (R-OR) have indicated that unless the
 agencies are reauthorized, they will be unwilling to recommend any future
 funding.  Senators Kassebaum and Jeffords have indicated a strong interest
 in moving quickly in the Senate on NEA reauthorization.  The first hearing
 before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee took place on January
 24th, with NEA chair Jane Alexander testifying.  Additional hearings and
 mark-up are expected in mid-February and early March.  Senator Pressler,
 who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee and is responsible for
 reauthorizing the CPB, has indicated his interest in conducting hearings
 early
 in the legislative session on the future of public broadcasting.  Senator
 Pressler has already publicly indicated his strong interest in eliminating
 the CPB altogether.

 Congressional hearings on the arts and humanities have been scheduled for
 the following dates and are subject to change:

 Week of Feb. 13 - Senate Education, Arts & Humanities Subcommittee, Sen.
 James Jeffords (R-VT), chair
 Public NEA witnesses; NEH and IMS Administration and public witnesses

 Feb. 11 - Manville, NJ, VFW Post 2290 Meeting Hall, 1:00 pm

 The House Appropriations Committee is expected to draft a rescissions bill
 in middle or late February, with cuts in current FY95 funding.  The House
 Budget Committee expects to draft its FY96 budget resolution by February 9
 or 10.

An act of *violence*?  Eric, get a life!  While I agree with the
rest of your posting, the use of the word "violence" in relation
to poetry seems out of place.  To whom is such violence
directed.  I say "whom" because the term is large enough to
burst through the relatively insular worlds of poetry, theory,
and any other academic discourse.  People who have experienced
real violence must react to your statement with puzzlement, to say
the least.

         BUFFALO (AHP) -- The day _apex of the M_'s headquarters went up
 in flames, a bystander caught three of the children as they were thrown
 from an upper-story window.
         But just who that man was is in dispute, and the Office of
 Monitored Sophistry doesn't know who should get a commendation for helping
 save the children.
         Four men and a woman have stepped forward, claiming to be the one
 who caught the children Mar. 15 and carried them to safety.  A fourth child,
 who jumped from the window after throwing the others, was hospitalized.
         One of the men, Charles Bernstein, a 45-year-old migrant worker,
 said he even has a blister, a burn mark and a suit that smells like smoke
 to prove his story.
         The Sophist's office plans to honor someone, they just don't know
 who, said Marjorie Perloff, a spokeswoman for the Monitors.  Another
 spokesman, Tom Mandel, suggested a bakeoff for determining the hero, but
 this suggestion was rejected out of hand.
         In any case, the injured child, Pam Rehm, will receive an award
 when she is released from the hospital, where she is recovering from burns
 over 40 percent of her body and scorched lungs. The other children

 escaped with minor bruises. The children are all twentysomething.
         ``It's not really important,'' who caught the youngsters,
 Perloff said. ``Believe me, I don't think nothing of it, as long
 as the children are safe.''

        bliss of life after death, but it is preferable
                        not to have died at all."

Poetry comes into existence in the absence of poetry, where words
and language become the objects of a near infinite number
of experiments designed to animate a long since passed away corpse.
The experiments are interesting, but the corpse, however exquisite,
is not. Even the stink, which for some time intoxicated the half-dead
disciples of its cause, has become merely another of a countless number
of environemntal signs of our collective desperation. The most serious
of all work is the most comic, and the most comic the most tragic. The
laughter is no longer joyful, but sardonic. Indeed, the most outwardly
revolutionary of acts have become the most boring.

We learn to live on breath alone. We learn not only to lie
profoundly (as the disaffected poet said, and to ask ourselves,
knowing this, whether mendacity is the best policy), but to understand
that the key to the dissapperance of the world itself has itself,
with the world, dissappeared. The aura surrounding the false
joy of our recognition that we are all ghosts, has become
as repetitive (and thus boring) as the pseudu-political act of revealing
"the corpse" for what it really is. We learn not only to live,
but to live lacking death, so that the over aestheticized funeral
of poetry lacking poetry -- the stillborn child of politicized art --
can finally come to an end.

Life has never been more than life experimenting with life. Poetry, at best,
has ecstatically been both a lamentation and celebration of that fact.

                 WHO SAYS POETRY IS USED UP?

     I went to a poetry conference sometime in the 70's at which there was
one of those poetry readings that go on all night.  There were seven poems
on the death of gold fish-- two in tetrameter couplets, one in Skeltonics, one
which included three Latin names of medicinal herbs. I have really seen
nothing like it since.  In fact shortly thereafter it became unfashionable to
mention any thing at all.

     We once had a gold fish named bubbles, who lived much of the time on
our kitchen table, and she was mentioned in poems by at least three visiting
poets with whom I sat after dinner discussing Skeltonics and arc welding
and drinking coffee. In those days poets spoke of serious matters.

     Bubbles lived a long life for a gold fish, and when she was grievously
flushed, it was no longer considered fashionable to write on that theme, so I
wrote about my 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk, thus, substituting the death
of my car, named after a mighty raptor, for Bubbles. It was a cunning
stratagem.

     Your assingment for next week is to write on the vanity of human wishes.
This is a theme even older and nobler than dying gold fish, which itself goes
back to the Sung dynasty.  If you think you are not ready to handle such
lofty material, you may attempt to remedy any of the lacks in recent poetry.

        To The Bloodless Refugees Of Emptiness

                        "Through the suburbs sleepless people stagger,
                        as though just delivered from a shipwreck
                        of blood."
                                        -Garcia Lorca, The Dawn

   What now exists as palpable global destiny? What are its markers,
its sculpted crimson signs?

   The psychic atmosphere implies a return to troubled fiefdoms,
to monarchies trebeled by ferocious glints of bloody erosion. The
sun continues to burn, the tides swarm across their shores with their
sulphurs, while human continuity appears and disappears, like a
netling grimness of ghosts. What arises from this startling anti-
mass is the progressive neutering of the species. During this con-
tinuing dearth of higher foci even lightning is misconstrued as
mere electrical theatrics. World citizenry now progresses as an
artificial epitath, as a spotted hyena starving on kelp, in an
atmosphere of plight, hovering in balanced enigma. A spoiled voltage,
a principle lacking in cohesion, where horizons disintegrate,
where ideographs explode into darkness.

   Humanity, like generic refugees, profanely strewn across a
dome of exploded heliographs. The politicians crave for momentary
incisions, for influential poison, much like staggered antelopes
searching for sublime direction. For instance, a once dependant
compass, now a locust eaten crystal. The collective path, a roving
generation of hatchlings, devolving in sullen mental savannahs.
We've witnessed many centuries of emigres, of disruptive holocaust
phantoms. Now, all the fiestas and dieties somatically crippled,
maundering like leaves across sudden hurricane waters, with their
destinies entangled in a liminal brushfire pyroclastic.

   At present, the shadow of our phylum wafting through an un-
remitting mime osmotics. The linear goal, the abstracted referent,
now remains increasingly hidden in tumultuous occlusion. And what
is engendered by the latter, is the bloodless wake for uni-direc-
tional propoganda...

     Rumour has it that in what may be an attempt to
flee the ruins, many members of the royalty (including
Prince Gizzi) are currently flocking to California in
what has (with some tongue in some cheek) been recently
dubbed "Project Restore Coast." While some of the
native inhabitants fear that such an infusion of "avant-garde"
sensibilities might not sit well in what has been called
"one of the most alarming mixes of flabby pseudo-sixties
idealism and crass mercantilism" ever witnessed, others
have stated quite bluntly their favorable position:

"Why not hire all of them and have the best poetics
program in the nation?"

     According to inside sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity, Top Cop Bob Perelman -- perhaps because of
his en-vogue role in the recent film "Postmodernism: The
Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism"-- is the front-runner for the
recently opened position at Lost Coast University. Some still
contend, however, that despite Perelman's acting experience,
the fresh young face of Supporting Actor Aaron Shurin
 because of his wide-market appeal and, as
one audience member put it, "ability to relate," is still in
strong contention.

     We've received no reports yet on the tryout performance
of Cecil Giscombe, though rumour says that his reading
went on, as scheduled, without incident, and that a good deal
of fine wine was consumed by all parties involved.

     We now await the arrival of Prince Gizzi.

     Let us not fall into the sea
     Til its best time...

I'll try again to communicate the necessity of a multi-part relationship
between theory and poetry. They are inevitably connected in that every
poem participates in one or another or several theories of poetry (one
cannot write a poem that doesn't participate in any of several
series of ideas about poetry), but poetry and theory are
not the same. There can be many sophistic ways to describe this and it
is easily misinterpreted as a spiritual relationship, but it's more by
way of the range of ideas that poetry and poetics occupy each and both.
I am trying to avoid analogy, but a picture in sets would easily explain
this concept. To quote the song, it's okey dokey for identity to have
several faces as we are many of us poets, editors, theorists, drivers,
partners, workers..... James

Yes and you have raised what is for me the interesting question of what
aspects of the poem can possibly separate, have an independent existence,
from its theory, its author, its reader, its context. Is the poem an
object that can in that sense be independent or are we talking about
varying densities of language that participate in a discipline called
poetry to a greater or lesser extent. To have the discussion properly we
need to change its terms. I think the focus is now sharpened by your
question. But I go too far too fast. Jmase

Dear Eric,

Theory is formulated ideas about how things work. You don't
need theory, or to be that theoretical, to have a context, to have lots of
contexts, as I assume most people do, especially in this day and age.

There is no single, proper context for a work of art. There is no single,
proper context through which to read Shelley, Milton, Pound... It may be
helpful to be aware of the contexts through which these poets viewed their
own work (and art, life in general) but one does not need those contexts
in order to be a receptive reader of their poetry.  Those who say
otherwise are, to me, playing a big power game: My explanation is better
than yours or my explanation is the right one and you are misguided. I
know more than you do, so don't challenge me. My idea of art is better
formulated than yours, so my view of art, or my art, is superior.

Of course some peoples ideas are better formulated, and as explanations
these may have more value. But the relationship between such explanations
and the art is entirely problematic. The individual must have her own
response to art, and the individual must have her own contexts for
creating art. Explanations may be helpful or destructive in this endeavor.
If I emphasize the negative here it is because others don't, and because I
see this negative as looming large over the art today.

I do appreciate your letter, your sincerity and your struggle. I agree
that this discussion will not be resolved, and I agree that these tensions
may be productive. But if you don't believe your own contexts (which
neither defer to nor ignore the contexts of others) are all that are
necessary for appreciating or creating art, then I believe you will miss
out on the best art has to offer.

Some suggestions:

Friends, don't be lazy: change the subject line if your message is no longer
about reified names, boundless vocabularies or apex of the M, etc.

And for personal notes (e.g. my wife can play second base), write to each other
not the list.

Thanks.

It's all very well to blame the greeks for theory, to be sure;

I think it's clear what that means if it is understood
more or less along the lines of 'every statement has a
theoretical basis' or 'every empirical fact has a
theoretical basis.'

Is there some further sense, special to poetry, in
which each example has a theoretical basis (or
implies a theory, or however you'd formulate it)?

what do you want? That I demonstrate that I've been a victim
of violence? I have. That I demonstrate I've commited an act of
violence? I have. How do I prove this in your opinion? A story?
A police report? Snapshots? What would this prove? That I have a

Before James and Tom take off completely, or as they proceed to what are
for them more interesting questions, I would like to mention that the
fact that we can derive theories from works of art does not mean art does
not have its own level. Art is much more than these theories, and that is
one reason why it has its own level.

    "Real" vs. fake violence. As i write this, there is a woman screaming

     it kinda puts my "merely mental' pain into perspective, yet there's
     also the fact that someone can GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS--be there

     that may be more PHYSICALLY violent than the GOVERNMENT oh so politely

     Tosh singing "tell me who are the criminals..." Chris (or one who

Considering the recent rather odd discussion on "violence" I agree with you
that there can be a "violence" to the way theory is used, as I should say
there is a violence, perhaps more metaphysical (butnevertheless neccessary
as all metaphysics, spirits, narratives, are neccessary) to a certain
aestheticized position.
     I don't argue that this is your position, incidentally. There was
much in your posting I agreed with, as above, some I didn't:
I think we can have a respectful disagreement. I think that's possible.

I'm starting to get a clearer picture of what is implied
in James' dictum "every poem has a theoretical basis," &
I thot to try it out on you all.

Take a musical equivalent. Certainly, every sonata
has a theoretical basis - in some version of the
classical sonata as an idea, a form and ideal for
musical expression. And this clearly is theoretical
in a real sense. Every string quartet, symphony, etc.

In the above, we are referring to the character of
an art form historically. we are referring to European
music from the late 18th century forward, continuing
in varied ways to our own day when, still, someone
writing a sonata wd be operating from a theory of
the sonata, and a theory of music englobing sonata
theory. Similarly for non-classical forms.

So what is being indicated here is not an analytical
fact, nor a god that's there willy nilly, but the
developing character of an art discipline: its
historical character, its self-expressed ideals
and forms, and ways - parts of the ways - to
approach and understand works within that discipline.
And I think one cd rewrite the description of music
to fit equally well the history of painting, again
European painting.

This is different too from my supposition or query
whether James was just saying that as every expression
or human act occurs within a cultural context which
establishes at least a domain and horizon for its
formal ideals of truth, appropriateness, appeal, etc.,
so a poem, in that sense, implied a theory (or even
theories).

In a sense then, what James is argueing for is a
historical poetics, that we understand poetry w/in
the context of the extended internal and external
conversation (challenge and response, as we say
in the login world) which underlies its practice.
This is strong, open and interesting. What does
draw one to write poetry? How are terms (viz.
spirit) interesting or operative in that
conversation? His requirement of the apexers
to nuance, to be subtle, not to be frontal,
about their terms, is then a request for them to
enter that conversation, and not a pan from the
superior position of one who's been around
long enough to know better, as it were (and in
that formulation I think too that I'm trying
to recontextualize some of what may come off as
arrogance in my own contributions here).

I haven't meant to represent James in this, but
to open the ways his urgencies (and poetry is an
urgent endeavor or nil) allow me to think and
respond.

Yes, yes. This makes it clearer. And extremely interesting.
     But, doesn't this, when it truly becomes poetry=theory, which
incidentally is not what I think I hear James saying, become another
form of intentionality? Ie., the poet intends this or that context?
     Might we think of the poem, as I think Tom  indicates, as a dynamic
in which these varying contexts, spirits, politics, narratives, metaphysics,
and everything that works against these, circulate? Might we think
ofthe poem, or any work of art, as an intricate process in which
a multiplicity of concepts, with a both   small and a capital C occur?
     This implies, to me, a poetry that works against stability, that
is anything but static. And seems to me something that implies that
thinking/creating/versifying/etc. never ends.
     just a few scattered thoughts. Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

Hopefully this will be more readable:


        James Sherry is undoubtedly correct that poetry cannot
produce pure transparent immediacy, and it is therefore inevitably
supplemented, consciously or unconsciously, with theory.

        It seems to me, however, the following points might advance
this thread of discussion.

        1.  Poets are as responsible for their theory as they
are for their art, and poets during the past twenty years have
often abdicated the responsibility.  The theoretical results
in philosophy as such and in the social and physical sciences
are not irrelevant to poetry, but their use in poetics is
limited at best.  The poet must think through the same issues
but think through them in relation to the concrete practice of
poetry.

        2.  The poetry that is of enduring interest from Hesiod's
_Theogony_ to Jack Clark's sonnets, Nate Mackey's _School of
Uhdra_, Anne Waldman's _Iovis_, and Charles Stein's _The Hat
Rack Tree_ incorporates its theory in the poems themselves.
Theoretically complex poetry otherwise is  by definition academic.
That is, the theoretical issues are always in play in the open form
in which immediacy and thought are always in recursive
interaction. This recursion is literally the motive of creative act.

        3.  One of the reasons this becomes a difficult
issue is that more and more poets find themselves employed in
graduate education, a very different role to the academic poets of the
50's (who often taught in small liberal arts schools or carried on the
liberal-arts-school function in a large university).  It does seem to me
we might find reasons to object to poems that illustrate this or that
hot theory.  This kind of poetry seems to me at present  a serious
plague.  It is comparable to the endless iambic tetrameter quatrains
that illustrated the theoretical pronouncements of late Eliot.

Don--
why not write them through as/in poetry? Or is that what you meant?  And
if so then pinnning down the 2/3 split would seem esp. pressing (whose
theoretically alert poetry is responsive and whose is just abdication?)

To unbeg this question, I guess, names might be named, or working
criteria given.  That is: how distinguish "in general" between poetry in
which
"           the theoretical issues are always in play in the open form
> in which immediacy and thought are always in recursive
> interaction"
and the poetry which merely "illustrates" a theory?  I guess it might be
done in practice, but I bet such a distinction would be hard to align
with something like "open form" unless that's either a School Cheer or,
essentially, a tautology.

        In response to my claim that poets must think through
the theoretical issues in relation to poetic practice, Tenney
Nathanson asks,

> why not write them through as/in poetry?

        Yes, I would say the _great_ poets, in some sense the
only poets worth _studying_, are those who set forth clearly in
the poems themselves the circular dependency of immediacy
and abstraction (Parmenides, Lucretius, Blake, and Olson are
examples).

        Other poetry is read as journalism (i.e. information set
forth in the context of the large unstated prejudices of the day)
or as distraction (poetry as tv).

        It does seem, however, that an intermediate discourse
is sometimes necessary.  Olson's _SPecial View of History_,
for example.

        The distinction between poetry in which the theoretical
issues are always in play and poems that merely illustrate a theory
is in practice quite clear.

        Poetry of the former type takes full responsibility
for the theory.  Of course, this means that the poem that
addresses its own theoretical base is still dependent upon
the theory that makes that poem possible.  Serious poetry,
however, takes full responsibility for the loop, which
is its central motive.

        Poetry of the latter type, takes the fact that any
poem must depend upon a theory to dodge responsibility for
the poem at hand.  Thus, poetry becomes a reliance upon
various algorithms of novelty.  The poet feels assured that
this work must be important, if he or she only had time
to think up or at least articulate the theory on which it
depends.

I believe that the "little lower layer" theory is Starbuck's. Ahab's
point of view is much more black and white, while Ishmael's theory is a
third one about the relative values of observation and humanity. This is
a theory common to many of the 19th century writers and much discussed. The
opposition of love to theory is a particularly savage one that justifies
a lot of abuse and anti-intellectual essentializing. It implies that a
lover can't have a theory. Aren't we all capable of divesting ourselves
of these fictions of hierarchy and digesting a mutable world view? James

I, for one, have some problem with the word "art" when it comes up in
relation to theory. Theory I can see. There's a practical quality to
it. I mean you sit down and type it out. Whether the poem precedes
theory or the theory proceeds the poem is probably moot. But when does
the poem turn into "art"? Isn't this something left way behind
somewhere? Here's what the _American Heritage_ has to say about it:

   1. Human effort to imitate, supplement, alter, or counteract
   the work of nature. 2.a. The conscious production or arrangement
   of sounds, colors, forms, movements, or other elements in a
   manner that affects the sense of beauty, specifically the
   production of the beautiful in a graphic or plastic medium.

So maybe that's my difficulty with the term. It brings up the spectre
of those terms like the "beautiful" and "nature" which seem foreign to
activities that might have some application to our present
gatherings...

this is such a knotty issue, but i'll risk a few premature assertions...

it's probably worth pointing out here that much of what is taken as
properly theoretical these days, academically speaking, is in fact theory
about theory... metatheory, that is, of one sort or another...

now not to conflate terms further, BUT theoretical practice, as i understand
same, ultimately must account for itself... the logic, that is, is not one
of a hermetic system (regarding which one may cite any number of related
proofs contra) but one, rather, of recognized and working (conscious and quasi
-conscious etc.)
mutual interrelations of signifying practices with somewhat differing aims...

i say "somewhat" because there is, on the surface of it, no recourse to any but
a generic
preference that places, say, 'art' over here and 'theory' over there... now
in practice there ARE of course distinctions, and distinctions such that one
may be led to believe that art *must* be over here and theory *must* be over
there... but what justification, other than an empirical (and perhaps anecdotal)
claim as to the intrinsic primacy of art, can anybody make, finally, that does
not bring with it either a (however carefully worked out) faith or an
institutional(-historical) predisposition, and more than likely both?... that
is, the 'art vs. theory' discussion is a vexed issue precisely because there
would seem to be no overarching consensus as to what we might hope either
practice to accomplish (in practice... and yeah, "we")...

i grant that the past couple of decades has witnessed the erosion of artistic
authority (if you will) in the name largely of theory... surely this is part
of the general trend, that of the movement of more and more intellectual work
into the "academy"... but just as surely this need not necessarily blind
anybody to the interdependencies at work between these symbolic-material
'realms'...

so to pose the question of what it is that art does over and against what it is
that theory does---if i may be allowed to wax utilitarian for a moment---is to
ask, essentially, how it is we regard the place of intellectual work of one
sort or another given our respective public/private sites...

    Is Ron saying thus that if Parmenidies would have recognized the
    "presence" of the signifier that he would have been able to prove
    that language can produce pure immediacy?????
    And what does this "pure immediacy" signify for people?
    Can immediacy be said to be pure?
    Should we theorize immediacy?
    Is irony the expression of immediacy on the 'level' of theory?
    And what of the "circle"?
    Don Byrd spoke of the "circular dependency of immediacy and
    abstraction"--but if the "circle", an "ideal form" that doesn't
    exist "in nature", is an abstraction, this mutuality privileges
    the abstract (and is perhaps not mutual)...
    Circle line, vicious circle, Aristotle's god of pure contemplation,
    Short circuit. Spinning one's wheels without "intentionality"
    Will the circle be unbroken? When you get circulars in the mail
    do you consider them junk mail? IS THERE a circle, an "inner
    circle," "The pleasures of merely circulating"--the Blakian
    vortex, girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool?
    Is the circle a chain, a golden chain, should we TRUST ANYTHING?

I'm sorry Ron. I'm confused. How is the signifier "present?"
     My understanding, admittedly limited and admittedly "academic"

Imagine this, James, that at the moment the poem enters the world,
rather than having a theory as its basis (as you put it), it
simultaneously engenders a theory, a counter-theory, a non-theory,
several anti-poems, non-poems, and counter-poems, and in a sort
clinamenic, rhizomatic fracturing that spreads across the face of
the world as we know it, multiplies, swerves, joins, splits into a
massive multiplicitous joyful inscrutablility in whose features we may
vaguely make out something resembling the possibilty of a white whale
sporting amongst what Ishmael called "young Leviathan amours of the deep."

I saw something like this once at the particle accelerator at
Livermore Labs--an image of an electron which, as it approached the
speed of light, disappeared completely from our space/time continuum
(where the hell did it go?), only to reappear in a shower of subatomic
particles, anti-particles, non-particles, and god knows what else.

Since Moby Dick got in between James Sherry on one side and Don Byrd and
Mike B on the other (the latter playing Ahab as theory off against
Ishmael as poesis and freedom, as I understand it, it's worth drawing
attention to Don Pease's terrific chapter on Moby Dick and what he calls
the "cold war  consensus," in /Visionary Compacts/.  The point being that
Ahab, in "cold war criticism," is figured as totalitarian will, from whom
Ishmael's liberal symbolism (allegory versus symbol gets mobilized in the
criticism as well) liberates "us."  Pease is of course critical of this
enabling dichotomy, and thus lines up roughly w James S. and against Mike
B at least.  So that poetry as opposed to (hegemonic? totalizing?) theory
would if not be part of, then at least seem to have an interest in
appealing to an enabling fifty year old liberal politics of containment.
Curious.

        BUFFALO (AHP) -- The ``mumthing different'' about ``the
M'' has come under fire from poetry abuse prevention advocates
who contend it has caught the fancy of underage readers.
        Critics in at least 10 states have complained to Buffalo's
Poetics Program about the radically transparent verbiage, saying it
has a sour aftertaste like baby formula but a slightly higher
confusion content than Poetics' own original brew.
        They say M is increasingly consumed by juveniles, and has
fostered false rumors in some areas that it is undetectable by
breathalyzer tests used to prosecute poets with slurred speech.
        ``The product is clearly designed to seem different from
regular language poetry,'' said Mark Wallace, executive director of
the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. ``It's

enticing young people to consume poetic verbiage, kids that otherwise
might not read the stuff.
        ``I think it sets a pattern of the poetic verbiage industry
constantly testing the waters with different kinds of products to
see if they can find ways of expanding what has been a stagnant
market.''
        The Poetics Program has responded to the criticism with
an aggressive program emphasizing M is for adults only. It has sent
letters to community leaders, book reviewers and magazine editors
stating that M will register on breathalyzer equipment.
        ``There are always things kids are going to find appealing
about what adults do,'' said Poetics spokeswoman Charlotte Pressler.
``We feel we have very effectively addressed all of the issues
overall.''
        ``apex of the M,'' packaged in a red cover, splashed onto
the poetic scene in Spring 1994, catching on in a slick, quick-moving
editorial campaign where words with a New Age connotation were
substituted for the more formalist vocabulary of traditional
language writing.

        ``Opaque'' was out, ``transparent'' in.  ``Shelley''
replaced ``Shklovsky,'' ``love'' replaced ``method.''
        This Fall a new campaign, with the slogan ``M is mumthing
different,'' was unveiled on the internet.
        M has a confusion content of 3.7 percent by weight, compared
with language poetry's confusion content of 3.6 percent by weight,
Pressler said.
        The transparent verbiage has become one of the most successful
new products in the industry, and has been credited for much of Poetics'
recent revenues.
        Poetry abuse prevention advocates say they began noticing
increased M consumption among juveniles last spring.
        In Albany, N.Y., poetics police reported large quantities of
M at juvenile drinking parties, said Betsy Burns, program coordinator
for the county's Drawing the Line on Underage Poetry Use.
        That county also is where the false rumors about the
breathalyzer detection spread to the point that Burns' group made a
video of a literary critic (Jeff Hansen) getting confused by M. The
video showed the test detecting this confusion.

        Since the prevention efforts began, there has been a
decrease in the number of complaints, Burns said. One factor
could be that more parents have become aware that M is adult
verbiage, she said.
        Kevin McGee of the Marin Institute, a poetry abuse
prevention group in Marin County, Calif. said he has noticed an
increase in M use among younger college students who have been
``very taken by the editorials and have embraced M.''
        ``The whole `mumthing different' is for a generation
that's looking to define itself but doesn't know what to say,''
said McGee. ``It plays off that myth that something like poetics
won't affect you the same way free verse or hard poetry will.''
        Inquiries to the Poetics Program about M peaked at about
200 in May; in the last three months of 1994, inquiries totaled
about 10 a month, said Pressler.
        ``We feel we have very effectively addressed the issues
overall,'' she said.
        Yunte Huang, group manager of confusion issues at Poetics,
said the program has financed some poetry abuse prevention aimed at

underage drinkers.
        ``We are very concerned and it is not our intent that this
is a product that is consumed by youth,'' he said.

Generally I like to refer to Deleuze & Guattari, but I do believe that
the relations between/among "book" & "literature" are entirely
problematic, and I can more easily embrace the concept of book as machine
than literature as one.

I also find most statements that, as D. Byrd says, poems "incorporate"
theory to be too pat. They may do so, but hopefully in a way which
enables both theory and poetry to be anything but dogmatic and
inflexible.

Please explain, Spencer, what "level" art has. Art has its own level, is
this like one of Dante's circles in the Inferno, or somewhere up some
other cosmological ladder? Can art or theory really be divided so clearly
from one another or from any number of other practices we can name, like
work, state, love, morality?

        That is, Wittgenstein gave up the possibility of presentational
immediacy and the transcendental signifier, and decided to use ordinary
language...  The proof is not the existence of a transcendental sign,
but that, if there _is_ a transcendental sign, it cannot be spoken.

        I do not understand the demonizing of the transcendental
signifier in Language poetry theory.  In fact, as attractive as the
idea is from an emotional point of view, it is not an important
idea in western logic. Those who have taken it seriously have
tended, like Wittgenstein, to give up on the idea.

        If it is too rigorous for scientific logic, its
existential requirements are too stringent for poetry, which is
after all predicated as a fiction. Even the poet who claims a
transcendental signifier does not.

What role does the differing institutional (academic and otherwise)
authority given to "theory" and "art" in a context in which they are
definitely understood as separate have to do with this current debate?
I'm tempted to say that if you want to be listened to, you better call
yourself a theory.

        We could probably use the words "theory" and "art" anyway we want
(would that make me Wittgensteinian, in a sense?) but that doesn't mean
anybody else is going to ( I know that does make me Wittgensteinian).

         SAN FRANCISCO (AHP) -- This time he has a reason to leap.
         Watten, the killer whale made famous by the film ``Free Barry,''
 is heading toward a new home in Michigan and eventual freedom, his
 owners announced yesterday.
         The Berkeley amusement park where Watten has lived for the
 past decade signed an agreement donating the 3.5-ton mammal to the
 Free Barry-Watten Foundation, which plans to eventually free him in
 waters off Japan after a rehabilitation period at the Wayne State
 Aquarium in Detroit.
         The amusement park said the 15-year-old whale, captured off
 the coast of Japan at age 2, has performed for over a hundred visitors
 over the past 10 years. Efforts to free him have been underway since
 the Poetry Flash film was released.

         ``Watten will be the only captive lang-po whale that doesn't
 have to do shows or perform,'' Patrick Phillips, director of the
 foundation, said at a news conference yesterday.
         The foundation plans to move him in November.
         In many ways, Watten is like a typical human teen-ager --
 he's got skin problems, has grown (to 21 feet), and now wants a
 girlfriend.
         ``He requires more space, different conditions and also a
 companion,'' said Svetlana Alpers, a spokeswoman for the Berkeley
 habitat Representations.
          Phillips said the park ``received letters and proposals of
 aid from all over the world.'' He said it waited until receiving ``an
 absolute guarantee'' that conditions in the killer whale's new home
 would be adequate.
         Phillips said the entire project will cost ``a heck of a
 lot of moolah'' over four years and include Watten's ``relocation,
 rehabilitation, possible mating, possible liberation and
 investigations into the whereabouts of the family of Watten.''
         That includes funds to build an expensive, 2-million-gallon

 tank at the Michigan aquarium.
         Experts said Watten needs to be trained gradually for life
 at sea -- weaned, for example, from eating dead fish to eating live
 ones.
         ``Watten, who has passed all his life away from the sea,
 would encounter serious difficulties feeding himself, caring for
 himself and surviving by himself in a hostile environment,''
 Phillips said.
         So far, the foundation has collected about half the needed
 funds, including a generous grant from Poetry Flash and George
 Lakoff Inc., creators of ``Free Barry.''
         The money raised includes a small sum from former students
 at San Francisco State Elementary School, who conducted a
 letter-writing campaign and saved pennies.
         They began sending letters in last month to prominent
 businessmen and individuals, including marine sociobiologist
 Jacques de Certeau.
          Certeau sent no money, but praised the children for their
 efforts. Singer Jimmy Buffett sent $500.

Perhaps this comment by Jarret Leplin may help to clarify the
Wittgenstein/Langpo connection:

         ". . . the falsehood (if that's that 'F' means) of q
does not establish the falsehood of p>q (assuming that '>' is
intended to represent conditionalization).  A conditional may be
either true of false consistently with the falsehood of its
consequent.  Also, 'it cannot be spoken' is certainly not
contradictory.  Of course, there are few things of which it is
natural to say that they are spoken: languages, certain
incantations, or perhaps texts that would normally be read rather
than spoken.   Many languages cannot be spoken by many
people; perhaps some - ancient ones, for example - cannot be spoken at
all.  Whether or not it cannot be spoken depends on the referent of
'it'; there's nothing wrong with the form.  More generally, to assert
that something cannot be spoken is not to speak it, nor is to deny
that something can be explained or expressed to explain or express
it. "

Also thanks to Don Byrd who at least refers to the next point in this
discussion which is the multiplicity of relations between theory and
poetry in the various poetries which this group is fond of referencing. A
matrix of readings of poetries with their theoretical biases would be
interesting to me, although obviously hypothetical as someone pointed out
already.

But as I have said the more articulate new responses today (Monday) only
make we want the more to discuss how the main question for poets today,
at least from my point of view, is the relationship of poetry to other
disciplines to the shared, extended texts of science, law, fiction, news,
philosophy, politics, medicine. This question applies to the role of
poetry in the society and culture, to the uniqueness of poetry which Tom
raises below, to the lineage of poetry itself which cannot be described
in any one way because each new set of poetries redefines the history...

I guess I don't think that there is any one way to view poetry so Tom's
question can't be answered from here. But the relationship of poetry to
other disciplines is periodically said to lead nowhere and someone last
week referred to Lamb or another 19th century critic's approach that we
need a point of view to avoid chaos.

I guess chaos is chiefly what I'm after in the sense of a term that does
not have apparent order but rather an underlying order and is both
generative of order and subltly influencing more overt kinds of order
with its own subversive similarities at different "levels" or on
different scales.

I don't have a good way to talk about this yet, but wanted to address the
issue to the group, especially now that a wider purview is being taken on
the subject.

p.s. I also had missed the connection but 'O Sole Mio' is sang as 'Just One
Cornetto' for a Walls Ice Cream ad on TV here which does seem to provide
the basis for a sustainable connection, via this as yet unsubstantiated
Pokey flavour from Auckland, between East London and Naples.

Questions follow:

1.The East London version always starts with 'you put you left (whatever)
leg in' and so on - I'm worried that the folk myth has got lost in its
translation to connect Pokey with a reorientation towards the right foot,
can you or anybody else here possibly clear this up? Otherwise the
ramifications of possible relations between Losely (high culture ice cream
manufacturers but arguably Cockney rhyming slang for Mosely - as in Oswald
and his blackshirts, resurgent in East London even as we post) and
Mussolini will lead to melted sleep.

Ron Silliman's question (why do so few women on this list post) tempts me to
delurk briefly.
        I enjoy reading e-mail, including the poetics list -- but this
form of communication, like any other, seems to have its strengths and limits.
        E-mail seems to me to be a good way to ask specific questions and
communicate specific kinds of information rapidly and effectively (book lists,
the Freely Espousing communiques, calls for papers).
        It's also a good way to argue positions for the most part already
formed. The quick cut-and-thrust of single-screen messages, though, seems as
though it might hamper the reception of more tentative or exploratory postings.
        People read their e-mail fairly quickly, and I don't think many
people save it for later reading or download it to a printer. Disk space might
be limited, too -- at least it is at UB. So, for the most part, once a message
is scanned, however it's scanned, it's gone. Not much opportunity for
re-vision.
        So, apart from its bulletin-board functions, e-mail seems to work best
for people who like to respond quickly and concisely to well-defined arguments.

        I prefer to have a good bit of time to think over a written message,
and to publish it in a format that allows for re-reading. I've stung myself in
the past by offering too-rapid reactions; but I've also found that in sharp
debate, reactive responses come to dominate over exploratory ones. So I find it
best to work through my own often somewhat divergent responses to current
topics either off-list, or in work written for print publication, or in
conversation with friends.
        Possibly this is a gender difference; I'm not sure it's entirely that.
There's also the uneasy position of divergences that don't quite attain to the
sharp clarity of an oppositional statement. I tend to diverge in just this way
-- should I call it "radical opacity"? :-) So I tend to lurk on lists,
including this one. Apart from this post.

*Correction to Arts Wire Congressional Schedule*
*Good News from LitNet*
*Bad News from the Midwest*
*Action Hotlines*
*NEH Annual Report*

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


*Correction to Arts Wire Congressional Schedule*

On 10 Feb, Marshall Reese was kind enough to forward a posting from Arts
Wire that included a tentative schedule of Congressional action affecting
the NEA/NEH/IMS.

The first item in that schedule, a Senate Subcommittee hearing of public
NEA witnesses and NEH/IMS administration and public witnesses, has been
moved back ten days.  The Education, Arts & Humanities Subcomittee (chaired
by James Jeffords, R-VT) will begin hearing these witnesses on 23 February.

The relevant hearing this week is Thursday's meeting of the House Interior
Appropriations Subcommittee (chair Ralph Regula, R-OH).  Walter Cronkite,
Ken Burns, and David McCullough are schedule to testify.

*Good News from LitNet*

Anne Burt at LitNet reports that 15,000 pieces of pro-NEA mail were
delivered last week to the district office of Senator Slade Gorton (who
chairs the Senate Appropriations Interior SubCom).  Someone's doing a hell
of a job organizing out there!

Through a wonderful sequence of events, Anne has also gotten Tower
Records/Books to commit to distributing LitNet materials in *all* their
stores nationwide.  The corporation has even volunteered to do displays
about the NEA in each store.  Once this plan is implemented, it may be
useful to give local store managers a call & see what else they might be
willing to do.  In any case, a quick thank- you call seems warranted.

*Bad News from the Midwest*

The Mid-America Arts Alliance has "broken rank" with the National AAA and
publicly called for the restructuring of the NEA.  I don't have the details
on this development, but the basic import of the gesture is easily enough
understood.  When you have State Arts Councils calling for their own
"defunding" (they receive roughly 35% of their budget from NEA), things are
bleak indeed.


*Action Hotlines*

When I spoke to a representative of the American Arts Alliance late last
week, I was told that traffic on their 900 number was healthy (no precise
figures were mentioned).  Today, however, another source--not inside the
AAA--reported that traffic is in fact disappointingly light (the figure
mentioned was 3,500 calls since start-up).

While we feel that these Hotlines fall on the passive/expensive side of
possible efforts to preserve federal arts funding, they do represent
something like the "least you can do."  If you live in a state whose
elected representatives in Congress oppose the NEA/NEH/IMS, please make an
effort to circulate the numbers.
Once again, the numbers are:

Emergy Committee to Save Culture and the Arts
1-900-370-9000
(An operator will explain that the call costs $1.99 a minute and will ask
permission to send a mailgram in the caller's name to his or her
Representatives and Senators.  Estimated total cost: $6-$8)

Cultural Advocacy Campaign Hotline
1-800-651-1575
(An operator will describe the message and explain that for $9.50 three
Western Union mailgrams will be hand-delivered the next day to the caller's
Representatives and Senators).

Note that neither of these systems permits you to direct mailgrams to
Congressional representatives outside your state/district.

*NEH Annual Report*

On Friday, 9 February, President Clinton passed along the NEH annual report
(1994) to the House and Senate with a brief message summarizing the "good
works" performed by the Endowment in the past year.  We reproduce Clinton's
message below:

To the Congress of the United States:
       I am pleased to present to you the Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the
National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Federal agency charged
with fostering scholarship and imparting knowledge in the humanities.  Its
work supports an impressive range of humanities projects.
      These projects can reach an audience as general as the 28 million who
watched the documentary Baseball, or as specialized as the 50 scholars who
this past fall examined current research on Dante.  Small local historical
societies have received NEH support, as have some of the Nation's largest
cultural institutions.  Students from kindergarten through graduate school,
professors and teachers, and the general public in all parts of the Nation
have been touched by the Endowment's activities.
        As we approach the 21st century, the world is growing small and its
problems seemingly bigger.  Societies are becoming more complex and
fractious.  The knowledge and wisdom, the insight and perspective, imparted
by history, philosophy, literature, and other humanities disciplines enable
us to meet the challenges of contemporary life.

Dear Ron,
        I read the list primarily for the anti-heg stuff, i.e. I will
laugh at least once today.  I would like to add to Charlotte
Presler's remarks the following:

        Generally, the mechanics of vms mail editing is not intuitive.
I have spent the last week learning how to file mail to folders.  I
learned the ins and outs of engine repair faster.

        The nature of these lists - they are generally anonymous.
Although the poetics list relies more heavily on the signifying
name than others, I feel like I'm walking into a room with a blind-
fold on surrounded by others whose state is unknown.

        Under these conditions what is a toy and what a weapon? I've
noticed there are whole trees devoted to teaching people how to inflect
their remarks by using 8-) >   type symbols.  Obviously this media,
or the people that write how-to books about it recognize there is some
problem having to do with what is written and its intent.

        This list by its title invites writers to perform.  So far, I've seen
 a series of challenges, duels and target practice.  It is a public
arena where we watch our gang try to make something of it.  I suspect
that if any real conversation gets generated, it does so off the public
screen.  I have found such correspondence through this list, and value
that.

        Normally, I would post this to your e-mail address.  But in
the spirit of your inquiry, I reveal myself.

In-Reply-To:  <199502132055.MAA24078@slip-1.slip.net>

I turned off my computer for a few days and here I have 50 new messages
from the poetics list. Boy, it's like you turn away for a minute and you
fall behind. What does this mean, and is it a coincidence that nearly all
these messages are being written by men?

Since I was pretty involved in the discussion last week, and since parts
of the discussion over the weekend do relate to things I said, I do wish
to respond--but forgive me if I am selective. There is no intention here
to be reductive.

Don Byrd says that poets who are not also self-professed theoreticians are
irresponsible (my paraphrase, which I hope is not going to start another
argument). I disagree strongly with this statement. I think Mr.  Byrd's
position here is significant because I believe something like this is what
helps to underpin the privileging of theory which I see in Tom and James,
and maybe others.

I believe poetry and all art is an attempt at world making. It is on its
own level because the worlds it creates are of a different order--from the
world or worlds we live our entire lives in on one side, and all our
explanations on another. To follow the analogy of this definition through:
Is this multivalent world we live our entire lives in irresponsible
because it did not come with a set of clear instructions?  Is God
irresponsible because s/he doesn't make herself clear (to most of us, at
least), because s/he doesn't give all the people who use her creation a
set of authentic, identifiable explanations to guide them, because she
doesn't even make her existence clear to a large percentage of these
people? If so, then I opt for irresponsibility over responsibility.

I imagine Mr. Byrd will not be enamored with my reasoning, or the
implications I draw from my world-making analogy. I admit that this
comparison doesn't do justice to all the slipperiness of the issue at
hand. I am not simply against responsibility any more than I think Mr.
Byrd is simply for it. Obviously, judgment and balance of some sort is
called for. The problem is, who do we trust to make these judgments? My
Byrd says "the poetry that is of enduring interest ...incorporates its
theory in the poems themselves." Of course that's true. In fact, I think
that's one of the few points which has been made in this discussion that
everyone may agree on. But there's no objective or foolproof way to gauge
which poems do this successfully and which do not. On the contrary, these
critical judgments tend to be notoriously subjective. This is a problem
that most today play down or ignore or are downright naive about. I would
not single out Mr. Byrd here, but at the same time I don't see that he's
made much, if any, progress against this barrier. (As with Lew Daly, there
seems to be quite a gap between Mr. Byrd's dramatic call for a new
direction and the poets who he says might signal this direction. In both
cases some good and/or accomplished poets, but it's difficult to believe
that these midcareer poets represent anything that radically new or
superior, compared with a lot of others working today.)

James Sherry says that the problem with my statement about art being on
its own level is it's hierarchical. James writes this in all caps, which I
did not appreciate, but which I think may say more than the content of his
statement. Since I first disagreed with James, I have gotten a series of
responses in which he has expressed his impatience with me. James seems to
think our disagreement is the result of my bad listening or my lack of
knowledge or my inability to comprehend what he is saying. There may be
some misunderstanding, but no more on my side than his. And I have not
written statements in all caps, nor have I spoken down to him or implied
annoyance that he would question me or my understanding of these issues.

I have argued for art as being more than all these explanations. In doing
this I have been drawn into the discourse. O.K. I admit that; I take
responsibility for it. I even admit that my position is theoretical, in a
sense. But please don't forget why I have made my statements. I am
concerned about the limits and dangers of this discourse, which are all
the greater for not being fully acknowledged. I see a need for questioning
the high-minded tone and attitudes of self-importance which go along with
much of this discourse. In saying I have more faith in art than in this
discourse, I am accused of being hierarchical. But I believe it is those
who have elevated this discourse that are putting themselves on a higher
plane.

Art or poetry is much more than this discourse (anyone's discourse), just
as life is much more than the formulated knowledge we each or all have of
it. In being more, art separates itself, but not so in the minds of some
who speak so knowledgeably, so authoritatively on this forum. They prefer
to argue about explanations that can never be effectively proven,
explanations which may be opposed to the more expansive spirits of life
and change and freedom and mystery that the best art celebrates. Missing
this or deemphasizing it, no wonder they think so much of their
explanations.

female nonparticipation appeared. I am happy that he said something
about this, and that his statement is getting some reaction.

The meaning of "art" for me comes from all the art I've experienced, not
the dictionary definition, nor anyone else's definition, semantic or
otherwise. I believe this is true for other people too, even if they
don't admit it. And that is why the word or concept does not become
passe. I have used the word "art" interchangeably with poetry in much of
the recent theory/practice discussion because I don't think the issues
here (at least the aspects that I've tried to address) are exclusive to
poetry.

James, I was quoting Mathew Arnold in 1849 who was obviously getting
nervous towards his candle of coherence in expressing (to Clough) his need
(which he hoped was more widely shared:
'to begin with an idea of the world in order not to be prevailed over by
the world's multitudinousness'
or rewritten / broken many ways
'to begin with an idea of the world in order not
to be prevailed over by the world's multitiduinousness' and so on into
variations.
But then Arnold was the author of 'Culture and Anarchy'. Useful multiple
edges inside that title too. This quote is contextualised by the 1851 Great
Exhibition, of course  - that first imperialist garnering of photography,
science, technology, art, design, botany and more under 'one roof'. A
multitude of information and influences and interfaces. The 'other' in
'our' midst.

Certainly 'English' poetry, with notable exceptions has resisted that
multitudinousness  -  not even through adopting an idea or even ideas in
order but by retreating behind the net curtains of sentiment and identity.
Chaos theory and analogy is wearing a tad thin, though I understand your
condimental drift. To go along that path a little (and it's a steal) it's
agreed that there is no possibility of accurately measuring the coastline
of Ireland because even if all other terms and variables could be
established as common at the outset by the time the full trajectory had
been traversed the actuality would have changed through process of erosion.
I'm keen on a poetry which engages with such slippage and makes its process
sing. The inter-relations of inextricable detail between poetry and theory
are those between positive and negative space or between improvisation and
composition  -

Or as Raymond Chandler put it (I like these hard-boiled-noses / heavy
academic references best):
'down at the corner was dust in the air, as though a car had passed that way'


good to meet up with you again

Ron, you're right. It's an issue. But it seems to me, from a rough count,
that the imbalance of posts approximates the imbalance in subscribers to
the list. About 1:6? Approaching that level of discrepancy (well maybe 1:4)
has been echoed both among practitioners and audience at events in England.
Although
there has been movement towards improvement over the past three years or so.

I'm keen on using and exploring the use of e-mail having been such a
terrible correspondent for ever since. I'm new to this list and am enjoying
the mix of agendas. Putting in the necessary time with technology is not a
boys own thing. There is a problem though to be acknowledged between the
speed of posting and more reflective responses. It puts extra pressure on
the reflective to be more 'polished' which is unfortunate. The rough and
conversational aspects of this site for exchange and engagement is what
attracts myself and probably creates resistance in others. No suggestion
here that reflection is gendered.

However it might be the train-spotting or jazz buff nature of rapid
response postings which is most gendered and off-putting. And anonymity
might help a lot.

None of this is an attempt to explian away. Glad you've raised it and hope
the response is constructive as it appears to be so far.
In anticipation  -  I never saw it as a health spa, can't we meet somewhere
more social? Ira recently raised a clear point about what passes
unchallenged here.

I love it when people sign their posts...

I get this list both at home and at work. At home, NetCruiser gives me
pretty detailed stuff not just on who originated the message, but their

At work, I'm using Lotus Notes and it only tells me that these messages

reread long chains of letters at home at night just to see who wrote

Subject:      Re: p>q re parmenides, etc.

ok, i can't resist this thread:

p>q statements are false ONLY if p is true and q is false... which means,
against a truth-table grid, that only 25% of the logical possibilities
are false...

which means that it's logically (and statistically) likely to say something
logically true given this construction....

BUT recall (if this is old hat for any of you) that p>q is not a statement
of causality per se... that is, it's not that p affects (or effects) q...
though of course the logic behind why p>q is true whenever p is false
would seem to invoke a mild form of causality...

it's not surprising that logic yields counter-intuitive results (science
and engineering do too)... or perhaps one's intuition needs to be twisted
some...

as to the example given, "if a and not a, then (whatever)," this would be
said to be vacuously true in that "if a and not a" is taken ALWAYS (in this
logic, anyway) to be false... or perhaps that should better read "true
vacuously"...

what's interesting to me is why this has become a topic on poetics... i mean,
it's baby logic in philosophy circles, and even computational theory textss
make short order of this stuff... i'm not saying that it's irrelevant, but
i am saying that i find it a curious thread around here... perhaps it's the
reference to wittgenstein, but i mean, like, he said so damned much, ultimately,

anyway, you will all probably note that i find it titillating myself, given
my former math. background...

so mea culpa!...

Subject:      gender...

i guess i feel mouthy today...

i like ron silliman's having called attention to the fact that this
list has
taken on a boys' club aura... this has happened, inevitably, to most
lists
on which i've participated... given the reality of something like
80-90%
internet traffic being generated by males, it's a statistical
likelihood
that most posts will be from men... but this doesn't explain the
relative
silence of women in a given venue...

what generally happens is what's happening now---one of the men (in
this case
ron) notices that women are not participating, and posts this fact...
and a
few women write in and attempt to convey some sense of their feeling
not
esp. motivated to participate... not always, but usually one of the
reasons
given is the fact that they find the space to be 'agon-izing,' a
"series of
challenges," as b. cass clarke has it... that is, usually, but not
always,
some element of gendering, however subtly construed, would seem to be
at
work in creating a less-than-generous ambience (shall we say)...

and usually, but not always, a few male subscribers react rather
unfavorably
to this charge, and a few react rather favorably... and usually, but
not
always, this leads to a further dispute twixt the men, again...

i tend these days to try to understand these virtual environments in
terms
of a dialectic (initially, anyway) of immersion and withdrawal---what
could
be taken as a requisite couple for artistic work in general... in any
case,
i've noted consistently that discussions in which the disputants are
male
invariably draw on those theories that manage to abstract out the
more personal
site(s) from which (whatever) work emerges... there would seem to be
the need
to invoke a lineage of thinkers, most of them male, a necessity for
moving
toward higher and higher levels of abstraction... i don't have much
in the way
of antidote to this (at least in part because i'm, uhm, male) but i
*do* believe
that much of what might pass as irrelevant to some on this list in
fact has
a place in these proceedings... by way of example, i posted to this
list
some time ago a rather lengthy, perhaps pedantic response to apex of
the m
that tried to account for *who* i am vis-a-vis many of you... perhaps
some of you find/found this
aspect of exchange
unnecessary (and i understand that i risk
criticism here
for attempting to privilege
my own discursive
orientation, but
what the hell)...

that is, we don't really know each other, many of us, and much of
this
discussion BECOMES agon-izing simply because we (incl. myself)
haven't taken
the time that perhaps we should to have developed and cultivated a
sense of
trust... i mean, i can stand the heat, so to speak, as i'm sure can
many of
you, but this is not a reason for coming together---here, there or
anywhere...

so i guess i'd have to opt for a more revealing, a closer encounter
with each
of you, however you each might wish to engender same...

best,

joe, grownup logic has not improved on baby logic so far.
                                    -------

I am sure you rmember that in order to prove anything logically we have to start
the null set (the nothing that IS!). Underlying ALL logic (baby & grownup) is th
which P is the null set.

Since Parmenides thought that the null set was false (for him there is no 'nothi
is that any NOT entails an absence (which is a nothing) so Parmenides was
just a tricky dude (a poet, you might say, who thought of the impossibility
of change while changing his clothes, etc.)

In theory he would not have been able to deny anything or assert anything. But
he was just like any of us.

        PROVIDENCE (AHP) -- The Poetarium is unlike most museums
you've visited.
        It's located in a Providence working-class neighborhood
with bridal shops, bakeries and bars on every block, about 10 miles
from Brown University.
        When you get there, you've got to climb a flight of stairs.
        Suddenly, you realize you're in the middle of more than
100,000 live poets, the kind that go ``buzz'' in the night.
        Children, especially, love it.
        More than 75,000 visitors -- mostly pre-teens -- file into the
poetry zoo each year, paying $3 apiece to be up close and personal with
the creepy, crawly inmates. Hundreds of school field trips have
already been scheduled for 1999.

        ``It's not only entertaining, it's also educational
and enlightening,'' says Steve Evans, the 30-year-old museum
founder and proprietor of Steve's Bug-Off Poet Exterminating Co.,
located on the building's ground floor. The Poetarium occupies
6,500 square feet on the two top floors.
        This is the real deal, no cheesy rip-off filled with
first editions and photographs. Evans says it's the largest in the
country.
        ``The Smithsonian poetry exhibit in Washington has less
square footage and I've got a million more poets still in storage,''
says Evans, proudly displaying a room overflowing floor-to-ceiling
with boxes, cookie tins and Tupperware filled with dead poets from
around the globe.
        ``I respect what they're doing. Their staff is extremely
knowledgeable and they really do a great job teaching the kids,''
said Robert Bertholf of the Poetry and Rare Book Room in Buffalo,
which has its own extensive collection. ``Steve has even come in
here and set up some wonderful exhibits, very professional stuff,''
Bertholf said.

        The Poetarium is designed to give the illusion of being
out in the wild. The walls are decorated in a bar motif, the
carpets are cigarette-butt strewn and the soundtrack is poetry's
own -- Amy Lowell chirping and Carl Sandburg humming. Movies,
holograms, microscopes and professional quality exhibits and
games keep people of all ages occupied.
        There is also a real swarming beatnik read-in and a giant
rubber-band ``enjambement'' for children to crawl through.
        Electronic quizboards measure your poetry intelligence.
        For example, did you know that New York School poets could
survive on just the food offered at gallery openings? that Hip-Hop
poets have more than 1,000 ``brothers'' and ``sisters'' each?
        And yes, Language Poets really do bite, but maybe they're
only angry about having a 12-month lifespan.
        There's even a scale to weigh yourself in New Critics, New
Formalists and other six-legged creatures. If you thought losing 10
pounds was difficult, imagine shedding a half-million versifiers!

Tagore, Phyllis Webb, Pablo Neruda, Carl Dennis, bpNichol, Sappho,
Jack Gilbert, Alan Gilbert, Allen Ginsberg and Gilbert Grape are
all present.
        ``Everyone here is really nice. It's not scary,'' said
Jessica Lowenthal, 22. ``I had lots of fun.''
        The centerpiece of the Poetarium is the pedants. Thousands
and thousands of good old ``poeticus obscurorum'' -- stuffed shirts --
encased inside a four-foot plastic fence that surrounds a model
library and study. The repulsive critters slither in and out of the
cabinets and drawers and occasionally attempt to scale the wall.
        ``I promise you, they can't get out of there,'' says Evans's
partner, Jennifer Moxley, the curator and one of the tour guides.
``There's a Teflon paint strip at the top which makes them slide
back down. If they get past that, there's a row of electrical wires.''
        Numerous poetry-related items are available in the gift
shop, including posters, T-shirts, coloring books, postcards and
plastic Vincent Ferrinis.
        Many of the poets are captured by Evans and his staff,
especially service director and exhibit designer Peter Gizzi, a

longtime poetry collector. Using butterfly nets and riding a
mountain bike painted camouflage green and brown, Gizzi rolls
into the wilds of nearby New York City and sees what he can
snare.
        For Evans, life's metamorphosis was a little more complex
than word-larva-pupa-poet.
        He began while a graduate student, working on the side as
a lobbyist for poetic environmentalists. This led to opportunities
in poetry population control. But he still prefers collecting to
killing the poets, and in 1997 Evans opened the museum.
        ``We used to have a smaller store, and we'd put whatever
we caught each day in the front window -- short story writers,
translators,'' Evans says. ``People were looking in the windows
all the time. Teachers even brought their classes by. I thought
this would be a great way to teach kids that poets aren't bad,
once you get to know them.''
        So what's next for Evans? Would you believe a poetrymobile?
        ``I'm converting an old paddy wagon,'' he says. ``Look
for us at a school or mall or senior center near you.''

          BUFFALO (AHP) - The struggling Buffalo Poetics
 Program sent high profile scorer Susan Howe to the
 Naropa Institute yesterday for veteran wingers Bobbie Louise
 Hawkins and Anselm Hollo plus minor league defensewoman and recent
 NEA recipient Eleni Sikelianos.
          The Program, which has only one win in its last
 five semesters, also sent a third-round pick in the 1999
 admissions draft to the Institute as part of the deal.
          Howe, who logged over a million miles last season to
 lead the Program in travel time, had just two insights and three
 inspired outbursts for five points in Buffalo's first 4 weeks
 this year.
          Hawkins and Hollo both played a significant role in
 Naropa's last Holy Grail season, in 1993. In brief stints with the parent

 club, Sikelianos has shown a great deal of promise.
          Hollo has six insights, Sikelianos has three insights and
 Hawkins has one inspired outburst and four insights for five
 points in 4 weeks this year. All three players are expected to be
 in uniform tomorrow night when Buffalo hosts the Southern
 California Sun & Moons.

Re Pressler's remark, I have just written a message with almost thesame
concerns to Charles Bernstein about why I included a message to which I
was responding in my response.

For me the quickness and ease of response on the list is contrasted with
the necessity to have a measured response. This is a hard place to get to
when I have mostly either had easy and extended exchanges with
corrections in conversation OR thought out slow exchanges by articles,
letters, etc. I think it's the newness of the medium and the unusual
nature of the way we must respond.

Thanks Charlotte for your message.

Am I to understand that Arnold was attacking the premise of the 1851
Great Exhibition? What a fantastic citation. The notion of slippage and
further of how order slips in to turbulence is at the ehart of wht I 'd
like to accomplish at hte outset, but later I'd like a further. And in
that sense the poetry might come after writing (yet another insidious
distinctino which won't hold up).

Subject:      theory and being heard

Chris Stroffolino asks me to answer "being heard by whom" when I suggest
that "to be heard you have to call yourself a theory." And yet, Chris, we
both know that we both can barely afford a bus trip to NYC, although I
have to admit that I did recently splurge and buy myself a new winter coat
because the old one was starting to stink.

Clearly, no one's being "heard" at all. But if I don't call myself a
theory I know for a fact I'm out of work. On the other hand, perhaps
there is a certain romantic charm in "living the free life of a roaver"
and I'm just busy playing it up for ratings.

See you on Letterman.

Dear Charles,

Yes, Don Bryd's statement on the relationship of poetry to theory is too
pat.  And so are some of Tom's and some of James' and others. And so are
some of mine. I admit it. In being drawn into the discourse, I have been
forced to formulate my position in a way that is not entirely satisfying
to me.  No matter how I formulate it, it will not be entirely satisfying
to me.  It is not just the formulations of others that I am dissatisfied
with.  This is the paradox of my antitheoretical position.

I do not want to create a "true theory" around my statements about art
being on its own level. Art is separate and it is not. That is how I
really feel. I have emphasized the former because I do not like the way
the theorists assume or reason (or pontificate) from the latter. The
problem with this is, it seems like I am only aware of the failure of
theory, and that I have this unbounded, starry-eyed faith in the power
of art. That is not the case.

There is a sense in which art and theory are connected in their failure
to fully impact people's lives. I tend to blame theory for its failure,
but the people (both artist/poets and viewer/readers) for the failure of
art. My lifelong experience has encouraged this distinction, but like any
prejudice I know that it is not always accurate.

To be continued...

For now, I thank you for your question and thoughts.

Spencer

Subject:      Re: Boy Talk

Ah, drawn out of lurkdom by provocative questions.... tho I must admit,
quite sheepishly, to be responding in *exactly* the spirit that Joe Tomato
has described--I do so hate to be predictable...

>Why do you lurk without posting?

Well, I *don't* really lurk without posting.  A couple of weeks ago I wrote
a fairly lengthy post describing *why* I feel--as a publisher and editor of
two poetry series and miscellaneous individual volumes of poetry, *and* as a
literary critic with "academic" credentials--like an outsider in the POETICS
conversation.  My post met with resounding ... silence.  Didn't garner a
single response on the list, though I did get backchannel notes from my old
friend Joe (hi Joe!) and from Charles Bernstein (hi Charles!).  I've been
active on the internet for a while, and I don't take nonresponse personally,
but it *does* generally seem to conform to a pretty gendered (and
racialized) pattern.  Since my concerns revolve primarily around issues of
how race/gender/class interact with the theory and practice of "culture" and
"art" (including poetry), whenever I post, I bring up these issues.
Nonresponse is something I've certainly gotten used to. Now I tend to post
only when I feel that I've got something pressing to say, and when I am met
with nonresponse, I usually let the matter slide, *unless* "becoming
visible" seems like a battle worth fighting in this particular place at this
particular time.

>What would it require to change this?

Oh, it would be easy to get *me* to post more....  But it would require that
someone(s) actually engage me in public conversation, offer a response to my
words.  Think of the studies of male/female conversations which demonstrate
that women introduce a wider variety of subjects than men, but that fewer of
the subjects they introduce are picked up and expanded on.  And the ones
which show that when a woman brings up an idea it's often ignored, *until* a
man brings it up--at which point he gets the credit for thinking of it and
she continues to be ignored.  These patterns are evident in email as well as
in face-to-face conversations.  But email is even more difficult for a woman
to negotiate, in my opinion, because the lack of physicality, the reduction
to a textual "body," makes it harder for her to be SEEN/READ.
    Look at it this way--email is one of the few environments in which
anyone and everyone can "pass" as white, heterosexual, and male unless
he/she speaks/writes out *against* that normative body.  Now, there are
advantages to being able to "pass" in this manner (advantages that members
of marginalized groups have always gained from passing), but there are also
costs.  The advantages are clear for women--no sexual harrassment, no more
being ignored, no more being marked as "other."  But the disadvantage is
that passing requires adopting the language and interests and *style* of the
folks you are passing *as,* and so concerns and questions and styles that
might be significant to a woman *as a woman* become unspeakable.  On the
other hand, in this environment in which everyone can "pass," it takes
constant vigilance and a great deal of ingenuity to create and perpetuate a
*nonwhite* *nonmale* and/or *nonheterosexual* textual body--difference must
be inscribed in each post in a way that makes it visible to the reader.  The
paradox is that "passing" allows women and nonwhite people to be "visible"
in the sense that they are not treated as "other," but it is predicated on
the disappearance of gender/racial identity.  On the other hand, refusing to
"pass," and insisting on inscribing a nonwhite or nonmale identity in our
email results, often, in our being "disappeared" in the manner in which
women and nonwhite people are "normally" disappeared. The entrenchment of
the normative construct in espace (which I tend to think of as The
Unbearable Whiteness of Being) makes me feel a lot like Ellison's Invisible
Man--I've *been* in flamewars in which I have textually kicked the shit out
of people who simply COULD NOT SEE ME.  (And if you haven't reread the
opening sequences of _Invisible Man_ it might be worth going back to, since
it sums up *exactly* the phenomenon I am describing.)

>Are there other venues (listserv discussion groups in particular) where
>you are more active?

I used to be very active on quite a few lists.  I'm the Typhoid Mary of
flame wars--where I post frequently, they usually become epidemic.  In my
Bad Old Days I could come out swinging against racist or sexist exclusion in
discussions and rile folks up so bad that hitherto peaceful (read:
"homogenous") espace communities would polarize and then shatter.  Grown men
would act like children and storm off lists or publicly swear that they were
never going to read another one of my posts.  Heck, I've pissed people off
so badly over email that at least one has, in all seriousness, threatened my
life.  (And yeah, those threats of violence--and implied rape--were
gendered, too...)  But I don't do much of that sort of posting anymore.
Mostly, I just needed to experiment with it for a while to figure out how it
worked.  And I concluded, after some very serious thought and long study,
that there was no way for me to *be* visible "here" in any of the ways which
mattered to me.  So I now confine my occasional public espace forays to
"raids across the border," with the intent of making the population nervous,
while at the same time escaping without serious wounds. And I have *always*
figured that the only way to create a "level playing field" is to build it
yourownself, so I got together with some like-minded people and started
SIXTIES-L, a moderated discussion list in my field of study.  I don't even
post *there* that often, but it is definitely a woman-friendly space, as is
demonstrated by the high percentage of women posting to it.  Which brings me
to the next question:

>If so, what do they do differently?

Well, it seems to me that moderated spaces, or restricted-access spaces
provide a more hospitable environment for women.  I've been on women's-only
lists, and in those places women have no trouble posting at all.  As I said,
on SIXTIES-L we moderate the discussion, and one of our rules is that we
don't allow ad hominem attacks:  you can harsh on people's *arguments* or
*texts* all you like, but you can't slam their characters.  This level of
protection (applied equally to men and women) might have something to do
with the higher percentage of women posting on our list.  The only
unmoderated list I know of which supports an overwhelming percentage of
female posters is WMST-L, the Women's Studies list for educators and
academics.  WMST-L is technically unmoderated, but Joan Korenman is one of
the most competent and active "nonmoderators" it's ever been my pleasure to
observe in action. WMST-L might work so well precisely because it *is*
mainly populated by feminists--and not only feminists, but women
specifically dedicated to the work of building Women's Studies as a field.

Hey, Ron, thanks for asking...

Best,
Kali Tal

Subject:      where the boys are

"Why don't more women post" is a rhetorical
question, right?  Everyone knows *why.*

(Or did you mean, "where are all the poster
girls?")

Camille P. might say it's because we are
neither skilled nor schooled in the art of
directional peeing -- although *her* urine
describes a pretty well-targeted arc.

Ron and Spencer, I extend my hand in gratitude
for your chivalrous patronage ;-] And Joe, you
sound like a sister. You all employed
one of the pedagogic strategies I suggested in
my first posting out of three in total, (which
was about the reluctance to speak):
teaching the verbally aggressive to
use gambits to draw out silent interlocuters.

My second posting was a short one I intended as
a respectful message about a poet whose works I
love.  I did not realize someone might find it
offensive, and just, uh, shot it off.  It's the
one Ira called "dumb" and reacted to so
vehemently.  He and I have since had a volley
of private e-mails first furious, then
apologetic, with invitations to continue the
dialogue.

Public nudity.  Like this posting.

For a day though I was traumatized by my first
experience of being flamed as I walked the
streets of Tokyo in a tormented stupor
wondering if I really was *dumb*.

I have already pointed out to Ira the irony of
that choice of adjective.

Anyway that's why I don't post or speak so much
in male-dom public forums, although my voice is
always wanting to vibrate.

Is it so imperative that we (girls, I mean)
seize the reins of (mainly male) academic
discourse? Maybe, but I'd rather be on a
different kind of horse, and take off the
stupid uncomfortable bridle -- and be free to
let Pegasus(sa) go where she wants, like I
just wanted to say that I wanted the horse to
be a pink one, not in spite of it being a dumb
thing to say but precisely because it is dumb,
and liking the fresh coy challenging dumb
hollow echo that bounces off it.


Dumbness has unexplored potential in poetic(s)
language, (especially in this age of acedemic
piranha-ism) at least as a backlash or contrast
or as a kid beholding a naked emperor.  The
dumbness of koans.

I read in a lot of poetics list postings
desires to "get things hammered out once and
for all" -- to be right.  Being right is not
always essential to me when I'm having a
conversation -- which act can be conceived of
as an opportunity to swap paradigms.  Is the
calendula more right than the hyacinth?  How
would *you* define "flesh-colored," or "eye-
level"?

I may be falling into the trap of analyzing
discourse from the perspective of biological
determinism -- intellectually suspect (I just
came back from a great performance of Henry VI,
in which Queen Margaret -- admittedly a
character developed by The Boy Bard -- verbally
kicked ass harder than anybody), but
empirically observable, too.

Like the frequency of qualifiers in "women's"
language.  Re-read this message for
conditionals, maybes, seems, etc.  Or that men
often (another qualifier) have two voices
(surely countless more), a public "war" voice
-- often heard on this list -- and a personal
voice, more modulated.  As Tom Mandel's former
secty. (Tom, you did call me "honey" now and
then) and B.Watten's former student, I should
know.


I like this list best when information ideas
observations parodies accrue, not when it
sounds like a dogfight that needs hosing down.
Even then I like this list a lot, even if it is
d***-wagging bigshot-laden and, as one woman
writer wrote to me "boys talking about boys'
books".  It's a techno-miracle for me to be
privy to its world while I'm marooned on this
archipelago.

Later, fellas.     Nada (Gordon)

Preface: haven't had time to fully digest all the prolific writing on the
relation between theory and poetry, but hazard an appearance I will....

Text: I wanted to respond to Spencer's comment that theory/art have not
impacted or have failed to impact people's lives.  Two points: 1) Isn't
this a very aestheticist postion?  I'm sure the answer is yes, and that's
fine, but this faith in art as having any ... responsibility or ability
to change people's live has fallen under serious scepticism.  I'm not
trying to  reduce Spencer's position to a humanism--and that in itself
would not be such a bad thing--but how can we not face the fact that art
itself has not saved us from ourselves? This point has been raised by
others....  2) Thoreau and/or Emerson make the point that reading their
texts should change the reader, that reading them should provoke the
reader into states of change,that the reader should undergo and be
willing to undergo change (a la Peter Carafiol).  I return to literature
and art of all sorts because I continually find things that challenge me
to think in different ways--Emerson of the divinity school
address--rather than in static and calcified institutions (no matter what
some may think).  However, for all this usefulness of art, for all its
ability to offer visions of difference and change . . . or simply beauty
doesn't it seem somewhat limiting to hold art responsible for humanizing
us?  I sort of feel (I'm not sure, in other words, but suspect) that what
is needed is a view of art that is able to avoid the humanizing and
colonizing functions of art/literature . . . a position that also does
not reduce its complexity and multiplicity to beautiful objects.

Refrain: I will now quickly peruse all the previous entries and see how
much I've repeated of others's statements . . . .

oh, and I forgot the most important thing:  I too feel Spencer's
disappointment (if I can characterize it as such) that art/theory has not
impacted people's lives more . . . .  But is that art/theory's failure or
our own?  I include myself in this collective Our here . . . .

The interpersonal too is political. You know you can trust me, and so
you are correct to tell me, in confident confidence, "with my gender
of partner preference defined, I can flirt passionately and we both
enjoy it". On the way home, I feel real recalling you say this. It'd
have been funny to make a joke of it then, or made a joke of something
else you've said months ago, turning the present moment always into
a lyric poem theory commercial with a punchline. It is real fun now
not to have made fun of you then, the trust has made real men of us.

Or we turn to other cultures. Peter says, from a source, but it is an
idea for my purposes, "with writing, in the first place, and the
distribution of writing, in the second place, comes growth of idealist
thinking." We have no memory of having been reincarnated. I wrote this
for myself several lifetimes back. I knew there would be no visual
flashback, that I would only have a sense of a familiar past of
writing, actually written be me aeons back, and use a (re)writing to
see myself there, writing myself to death for myself in the future.

Growth is also a fungus. I consider what Justine Frischmann says in
the March issue of Sky, "when you're in your twenties, being monogamous,
especially fronting a band, isn't a horror to transgress. Damon
read what I said about his flings, in Sky, and laughed". I'm walking.
I have the thought that marriage mustn't be broken, like the pentameter
was feared to be being broken, a superstition held to like a formal
practice, and so much blame dumped on marriage break-up and not how,
not the interpersonal time with the children, care where you put foot.

Or call it a political football. Carla Harryman answers a question,
"certain forms of thinking are simply kept quiet, kept away, kept hidden.
There are few locations in a public or social sense to value the creative"
- from _A Suite of Poetic Voices_. Underlining on the typewriter is like
a twelve string guitar, if the former is electronic and the latter is
acoustic. So that in a culture of good locations, the interpersonal
spaces made in community, the theatre of conversation in a platonic
space where our ideas play as we discuss things in words, lessen writing.

I am not telling you this. Derrida says in the Post Card "there is
the I of lover, the you of lover, the I that fears, the you that fears,
the four of us, the fear of us and us". Paraphrase/troop. I wrote
that too when I was nineteen, and about the thousand cuts of
stepping on upturned plugs. I stepped on a plug just now, it hurt
like memory. I love my readers non-sexually. I send letters and they go
over not under your head, my intended heart-to-heart became a history
of the city. By map we twist through streets, lists of locked doors.

        ALBANY (AHP) -- Officers of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Chapbooks (BATC) have surrounded the barricaded multi-media
lab in the basement of the Humanities building at the University
at Albany where a small band of writers, artists and miscellany,
reportedly led by poeticult figure Chris Funkhouser, have
sequestered themselves, stockpiling software, poetry, audio and
video equipment. Speculation is that this group may be a splinter
faction of the Branch Derridean cult which occupied that same
compound last winter.
        Funkhouser, who refuses to communicate with government
officials except through the internet, e-mailed the BATC officers
stationed outside the lab to announce that his group, ``... simply
wished to live an alternative publishing lifestyle.''

        ``We want to be left alone,'' Funkhouser pleaded, ``We
will come out when _The Little Magazine_ has been produced on
CD-Rom. We are exercising our constitutional right to digitize.''
        Sergeant Douglas Messerli of the BATC swat team says he
and his commandos are monitoring the situation for any changes,
``We hope it won't not be necessary to bring in the heavy mimeo
and stapleguns but we'll do whatever's necessary. We're not sure
how they're holding out in there. We are doing our best to stop
the flow of poetry in and out of their compound.''
        Albany Speaker of the Common Knowledge Donald J. Byrd has
sought to distance himself from the cult crisis, but sources close
to the situation believe that he may be directly involved with an
underground smuggling ring suspected of supplying the cult members
with poetry and other necessities.
        Chris Stroffolino, Secretary of the Department of Reality,
has called for a censure of Byrd whom he says withheld from his
department knowledge that Funkhouser was entertaining delusions of
an Imaginary University.
        Meanwhile, BATC officials remain puzzled about a suspected

flow of contraband materials in and out of the compound.
        ``We can't figure out how they're getting past us,'' said
a frustrated BATC spokesperson Lawrence Ferlinghetti, ``But we have
reason to believe that they are forcibly digitizing work by Charles
Bernstein, Anne Tardos, Jackson Mac Low, Madeline Gins, Will
Alexander and others even as we speak.''
        Self-appointed Prime Minister of Literary Video, Richard
Kostelanetz, has voiced characteristically outspoken support for
the cult's activities while being careful to note that he is
suspicious of their possible connection with Foreign Minister of
Antology, Pierre Joris, who failed to include Kostelanetz's work
in his forthcoming Anthology of the Avant-Garde.
        Joris issued an official statement from the Department
of Ontology and Anthologies today in response to Kostelanetz's
accusations. Joris said, speaking for himself and House Rep.
of the Whole Jerome Rothenberg, with regards to the top secret
Anthology Project, ``He can't know he's not in it. How does he
know he's not in it?''

I love the idea of "delurking" - like "decloaking" in Star Trek...

I echo Kali Tal's annoyance at the homogeneity, and applaud her post. It's actua
mark of difference one has to inscribe to signal non-assimilable content also
has costs, or at least this is how I feel having had to use it myself. What
Nada says about the "wartalk" of a lot of posters publically rings very true,
of myself too - since I went on the warpath, as Cris noted, over what I
perceived as a flippancy about mental illness in her very genuine concerned
posting for Bernadette Mayer, language "deficiency" as mental "defiency" in
so much writing about aphasia (eg Jakobson's) - Nada has since put me right
privately that she meant no such flippancy. I just wonder, as a campaigner
for children's rights, ablism, and AIDS awareness, what *gender* such issues
have, or are thought to have. Or perhaps: what gender does anger about such
issues, or what issues, have? I was really furious about what I say as an
attack on the vulnerable, so I used attention-seeking tactics, and angered
Nada, when I found out privately I had a lot to learn from her/you. Sometimes
accepting the right to anger of participants in a debate deemed gendered is,
for me anyway, a vital precondition to creating a space where I learn from
the person whose anger I accept (I'm very much talking about anger in this
disembodied, non-physically-threatening e-space). It isn't the exclusion or
the feeling invisible that bothers me, not in e-space, it's just boredom
with the batting around of fixed positions and no-one learning from each
other.

I say this in honesty, hope I don't seem to be discounting Kali or Nada's
postings, very mucch support more woman-talk. I don't know if this is any
other internetter's experience but I tend to delete certain regulars unread,
so that what I see is the list I get. I would definitely read anything
posted by Kali or Nada.

Very best,

Ira

P.S. Would anyone like to discuss Marjorie Perloff's review of Philip Larkin's
poetry in Parnassus, especially anyone who also sees problems in it?

        Actually I am not sure what Parmenides meant,
and I doubt that any one does.  He clearly did _not_
mean that change is not possible.  The clear theme of
his poem is spiritual transformation.

        The various attempts to formalize the logic
are takes on Zeno's paradoxes.

        It seems highly likely that Zeno did not
understand his teacher.  Students failing to understand
their teachers is fairly common.

        I quite agree that poetry is world-making,
which seems to me quite a task.  I can't imagine why
one would not want to use all of the tools that one
might have at hand.

        Some one noted that my statements seemed too
pat, and I think they probably are. However, I have
found that this medium, at least in its present state,
filters subtle discourse.

         Apparently I was not pat enough to make
my point clear.

        There is a poetry that sees theory as a
supplement (e.g. in order to get it you have to read
the poets theoretical essays or Derrida or someone),
and there is a poetry that takes responsibility for
the theory in the verse itself (it helps to have to read
Whitehead in order to understand the _Maximus_ but all
the necessary stuff is taken into the poem itself). Thus,
the poem is not an a mere example...

        Of course, it is perfectly possible to say "I
do not want to read dry awful theory. I am afraid it
will rot my mind with jargon and the dreariness of its prose."

        This is a real danger and a reasonable fear.

        However, a very large part of the world we
inhabit (if not the world we build) is theoretical.

        This machine by which I am commuting is only
incidentally a thing.  Above all it is a theory, about
which, I suspect, most of us are quite vague.

        And, of course, to the extent that language
as such is constructed, it too has a theory...

        The fact seems to be that at least in this culture,
the _power_ is with the theorists (e.g. engineers).  Perhaps
the problem with poetry is not theory but bad theory.

        When it comes time for us to demo, we often
seem nothing to show as complex and workable as, say,
the internet.

Why do I, as a male (non-female?) lurker, lurk as much as I do and, when I
post, only post briefly and relatively safely? I'd partly been rationalizing
it by telling myself I didn't have the time and/or that I didn't have much to
add to what was already being said. But Charlotte Pressler's recent post in
response to the "boy talk" issue really spoke exactly to my feelings too about
use of this forum. I'm much, much comfortable working ideas through in
conversation, with all the cues and body language and possibilities for
instant restatement, clarification, negotiation, etc. that that allows than I
am on the net, where I feel compelled (this may be my issue, I realize, but I
suspect I'm not alone) to look smart, informed, thoughtful, whatever, to an
audience many of whom I know but many of whom I don't. And if literal
face-to-face conversation isn't available, which it usually isn't, I'm more
comfortable working things "privately" in writing, drafting, redrafting,
rethinking, before going public. It may just be that I haven't yet learned to
use this medium or the list in a way that works for me and that also
contributes to others. The disjunctiveness of e-mail exchanges fazes
me--putting something forth one day, processing someone's response or
responses two days later when I've already forgotten what I said. And I also
share Spencer's feeling that whatever I say on here, I'm immediately
dissatisfied with, and I haven't yet adjusted to living with a dissatisfaction
that I sense may be intrinsic to the use of the list.

I've learned a good deal from all the recent posts on this, so thanks to
Charlotte, B. Cass Clarke, Nada, Kali (my apologies if I'm leaving anyone
out--trying to backtrack in my head over what I've read the last few days) for
your open and instructive responses, and Ron for bringing it up.

Am I the only one who finds tone hard to read on the net? I sense not, from
what Ira Lightman said in a recent post. I often can't tell, esp. when
someone's sounding snitty or high-handed or whatever, whether they're kidding
or not, and that makes me reluctant to respond--I find this particularly with
the more cryptic one- and two-line messages. Yeah, I guess I could ask them .
. .

As far as I can tell, no-one here has noted the recent passing of James
Merrill. A week or so ago, I believe, though I haven't seen an obit, just
heard about it. Merrill readers on this list are few and far between, I
imagine, but I always found him pretty interesting if one wanted to consider
matters of artificeand absorption and authenticity.

One final thread: I've got to back Cris on Hokey Cokey. Maybe it's becawse I'm
a Londoner (as another such pub song goes), but I only ever heard Cokey
growing up east of London, and only encountered Pokey when I came to the U.S.
For years I just assumed that it was one of those things that Americans
couldn't get right (just as when I first moved to Chicago, I complained to
people about their defective, non-Francophone pronunciation of Notre Dame [as
in University of]. )

I also never heard in the English version (or my English version) the verse
that asks you to put your whole self in. That seems a particularly
un-postmodern injunction.

OK, I'll shut up now.

Dear Mike Boughn,

Perhaps I'm a bit late in saying this, but I like your "engendering,
particle accelerator statement" also. I believe that the way all things
are both fragmenting and connecting is so great as to be incomprehensible,
literally beyond belief. This is one big reason why our beliefs and
explanations cannot be fully trusted.

When we go from a general sense of life's richness to explanations that
are more specific, that is when the trouble starts. We cannot formulate or
rationally comprehend this richness, its fluid order and connections, its
complexity and unceasing fragmentation. We all have our awareness of this,
dare I say, totality. But I believe art is better-suited to expressing or
dealing with it than theory.

We don't have to make an either/or choice between theory and art, but
there are very real dangers when those who seem to be the more
knowledgeable authorities of an art side with claims for the necessity of

may balk at my implication that they are adopting authoritative stances,
but I believe that is exactly what they are doing. In fact, that may be
the biggest problem with the statements they have been making on this
forum.

   Dear Alan GOlding--thank you for your comments on "tone"--Actually,
   that is an issue I am extremely interested in not only in this forum
   but in writing in general. I'm curious if there's any thoughts about
   TONE, as a form/content issue, as a question of moods, of ideological
   state apparati, whatever. If "tone" is "beyond good and evil" and
   "beyond right and wrong" then is it something that is automatically
   humanist (in a retro derogatory way) as a concern and should not be
   theorized and thus taken for granted and thus the emotional appeal of
   rhetoric becomes either lazily anarchic and "all over the place" or
   one may end up in that "toneless tone" that allegedly is a sign of
   "clear thinking" and "authenticity" (despite the self-conscious
   theatricality...)?             Chris

FREELY ESPOUSING UPDATE 2/15/95:

* INITIAL REPORT FROM PHILADELPHIA
* REPRESENTATIVE GOODLING OF PENNSYLVANIA
* ORGANIZATIONAL QUESTIONS (OR, THE ART OF PRACTICE)
* WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO IN PROVIDENCE
* (BONUS) TRIBUTE TO FREE ESPOUSERS PAST: WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

INITIAL REPORT FROM PHILADELPHIA

On Saturday, February 11, a "Forum to Maintain Support for the Arts &
Humanities" was held at The Great Hall on the University of Pennsylvania
campus.  Co-organized by Bob Perelman, Susan Stewart, and Gil Ott, the
event featured upwards of 20 speakers from the dance, music, theater,
visual arts, literary, and educational communities.

Perelman estimates the 70 people attended the two-hour event and reports
that media coverage was good. On Sunday, the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a
story on page 2 of its Metro section. On Monday, event-participant Julia
Blumenreich (poet, editor, and public school teacher) was the subject of an
Inquirer Op-Ed piece about art in the classroom.  The Daily Pennsylvania (U
Penn's newspaper) ran a front-page article on the forum and reporters for
several other magazines and papers are planning to run pieces as well.  All
of this is in addition to Perelman's own op-ed piece ("Government by
Irritation") in the Sunday Feb 5 Inquirer.

More details as they become available.

REPRESENTATIVE GOODLING OF PENNSYLVANIA

Staying in Pennsylvania for a moment, Republican Rep. Bill Goodling is
chair of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities.
Recently, Goodling has called for a 3-year "phase-out" of the NEA.  If you
know people in Goodling's district (which includes York and Gettsburg, but
what about Shippensburg?), it is crucial that they speak up for arts
funding.  For more information, contact Anne Burt of the Literary Network
(1-212-941-9110).

ORGANIZATIONAL QUESTIONS (OR, THE ART OF PRACTICE)

In his note to us about Saturday's events in Philly, Bob Perelman writes:
"The most intriguing possibility is the most difficult to implement. There
were many committed people from a range of different arts. We passed around
a mailing list--but what is the next step??"

The transition from discrete event to ongoing project is a fairly difficult
one.  But as Ray Rickman told the audience at Freely Espousing-Providence,
this fight will not be won unless people are willing to do something
*everyday.*  The task in the coming weeks is simple enough: we have to
outwrite the right.

But how can that task be accomplished? As the focus turns local how do we
gaurd against isolation?  What should the next wave of synchronized events
look like?  How can we be sure that the makers, and not only the managers,
of culture play a part in the national debate?

The key is to make the prospect of participation *interesting.*  If artists
and writers can't do that, who can?

We encourage everyone who is receiving these updates to think through at
both a local and a national level the question about how to continue and
expand these  efforts.  Open, imaginative debate is one resource we have
that the tightly organized, well-funded, religious right cannot afford.


WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO IN PROVIDENCE

In Providence, we shifted fairly quickly after the 1/28 event toward
planning our role in a broad forum on the Balanced Budget Amendment that
will take place on 2 March.  The work is of the always essential/sometimes
tedious kind: attending meetings, xeroxing fliers, working phone banks,
etc.  Still, it's the kind of action we're happy to be involved with since
the objective is coalition building.

Meanwhile, we keep trying to expand our means of communication: exploring
the possibility of establishing a list-serve (an as-yet unresolved
question), hooking up to Arts Wire, informing people about what *FE* is and
what has happened so far, educating ourselves about legislative processes,
and so forth.

We also spent some time assessing what relationship we wanted to adopt to
existing arts organizations.  At this point, we've decided to remain an
indepedent project and to seek alliances on that basis.  The drawback to
that decision is that we remain for the most part without resources.  The
advantage is that we don't waste time in intra-organizational squabbles and
we don't have to submit our thinking and action to an established "line" on
how and whom to organize.

All that which makes the pear ripen
            or the poet's line
                          come true!

Without the quirks
                and oddnesses of invention
                          the paralytic is confirmed
in his paralysis,
            it is from a northern
                        and half-savage country

          is hate.

Dear Nada,

I appreciated your post a lot. Specifically I liked the stuff you said
about "dumb." My feeling about it is, there are many kinds of dumb. Some
kinds may be easier to detect, but often those kinds are less significant
than kinds which are not so apparent.

I'm thinking of a forest and trees. And in this forest there are some
really big trees, some trees one could get lost in, maybe for years or
even a lifetime. Men are very good at this. I don't know if it's an innate
talent they--I'm sorry--we have, or something passed on and built up,
primarily through the course of Western Civilization.

What do you think?

Sigh.

Let's look at what's happened.

Some well meaning male person asked why women don't post more often on POETICS.
Several women "delurked" and answered the question, giving various and
substantial explanations.  A few men commented on the question itself, or on
the responses given by the women.  But only Spencer Selby has attempted to
directly draw any of the women into a conversation by responding to her
*ideas* or *assertions*.

Alan Golding wrote that Charlotte Pressler's post spoke to *his* feelings of
isolation and, thanking Charlotte and the rest of us for addressing
something of importance to him, changed the topic to a discussion of "tone"
in espace.  Still under the heading "Boy Talk" (which is always already the
proper subject line), Chris Stroffolino thanked *Alan Golding* for his
comments on "tone" and asked Alan a direct question, providing a jumping-off
place for a conversation between men, effectively appropriating the "Boy
Talk" header, and bringing us back to where we started.

Sheesh. Double sheesh.

IF YOU WANT MORE WOMEN TO POST ON THIS LIST YOU GOTTA *TALK* TO 'EM.  I know
that's a really hard idea to grasp--revolutionary even--but that's what you
gotta do.

Triple sheesh.

    *We now return you to our regularly scheduled programming.*

Subject:      parmenides, poet ***and*** theoretician

parmenides was a poet: what is extant of his work is a poem! [so perhaps he did
not mean it?]

He had what some people may call a naive theory of meaning: that if you name
something it exists someplace. Since you cannot name what is not, then what is
not is not--it does not exist anyplace. There is only stuff, all over the
place, filling the place, and there is no boundary between the place and
nothing because there is no nothing. For him, the universe is infinite (not
finite as some 20th century dudes think).

And, yes, since nothing cannot yield anything, change is impossible and
therefore illusory.

He perpetrated this monstrous blow to common sense in his poem.
But, remember, it was a poem.
So it's ok?

Well, no, because he was the father of metaphysics based on bad language
theory.

Your skill at email gives me hope that posting and reading are things worth

don't do that very often.

Anyway, I've been wondering what the value is here.

I like the informational posts (in fact I'd like to see more about
events/readings, and new books, mixed in with a poem or two, informal book
reviews maybe, why not review the AHP?)

Thanks for starting to clear things up.

Dear Jeffrey,

I can't agree that my concern for the failure of art to impact people's
lives is just aesthetic. Nor do I think it's a case of my humanism--at least
not a humanism which might be historically defined as an ism.

I think if you don't care about change then all you've got is art for
art's sake. I'm talking about anything that changes people outside of
their relationship to art. This would be a pretty broad definition of
change, which includes social and political change as well as changes that
are more exclusive to the individual, or changes that are psychological
and/or spiritual.

I believe art/poetry has failed to bring about much change, viewed from
any of these angles. What's mostly aesthetic is the success of this art,
I'm sorry to say.

Caring about change means facing this failure, and not being happy about
it, not giving up or settling for a success that will be bracketed in the
name of poetry or art. A lot of theory is addressed to this problem, or
aspects of it--I certainly will acknowledge that. What I share most with
the theorists may be this concern for change, this refusal to accept human
society as it has been or is. What I do not share is the theorists' faith
in the power of their theories, their belief that theories should be
effective if they sound right, or if they are based upon extensive
knowledge and good analysis.


Please remember, I am talking about the effectiveness of art theory in
bringing about changes outside of these bracketed aesthetic and
intellectual worlds. Remember also that my skepticism does not mean I
think theory is completely worthless or that it can play no role in a future
which I too have not given up on.

More on this later. For now I thank you for your thoughts, and your kind
words. I am glad some of my statements have engaged you. I also have been
engaged by some of yours.

"as yet unsubstantiated
Pokey flavour from Auckland".

"Questions follow:

1.The East London version always starts with 'you put you left (whatever)
leg in' and so on - I'm worried that the folk myth has got lost in its
translation to connect Pokey with a reorientation towards the right foot,
can you or anybody else here possibly clear this up? Otherwise the
ramifications of possible relations between Losely (high culture ice cream
manufacturers but arguably Cockney rhyming slang for Mosely - as in Oswald
and his blackshirts, resurgent in East London even as we post) and
Mussolini will lead to melted sleep."

Well, I'm glad the penny (cent or dime or whatever) has finally
dropped...  Yes, of course "Right" in this context does not have a
serious political implication.  What politician or poet has ever
stopped participating in the social dance, the Hokey-Cokey (or Pokey
or Tokey) when required to put the Right anything In?  None, I
suppose.

The relation of poetry to theory is the issue (or so I understand it
from the previous correspondence).  The song that propels the
social dance, in so far as it may be taken as a poem, commonly
disengages dancers from couple-dancing to participate in a species of
exhibitions of sometimes ludicrous and sometimes erotic wagglings
in which all share.  The politics of the song could be derived from
this, its apparent function, at "parties".  And its relation to
theory could well be seen in its intentional relation to the effect
produced.  So "that's what it's all about...... ----- .....".

[Note: "that's what it's all about" is usually followed by a shouted
word that like the name of the song varies from location to location
and sometimes from person to person.  It can be Hey, Hi, or sometimes
See.  I prefer " See" because Seeing what something is about is what
may be termed Theory.

Taking this as the beginnings of a sketch of a paradigmatic case of
the relation between poetry and theory may be of benefit to the
somewhat blurry discourse surrounding these two nouns when taken in
conjunction.

Agreeing with everybody on this, I would suggest that the bafflement
over the supposed relation between Poetry and Theory, may be somewhat
alleviated, when in all cases of poems, functioning and
engendered response patterns are carefully observed.

I suppose that at all times (and I am aware I may be alone in this)
that poems are items for recitation or recital, that they are either
to be recited by their readers, and if not aloud and before an
audience, then thought of that way.  Reading poems by oneself is a
fantasy situation of sorts, where one is searching for something that
will be effective as song or fable, narrative or moral exposition
(sometimes), or some sometimes absurd ridiculous and provocative
contradiction of these (to be modern about it), when an occasion for reading
 aloud should present itself.

Caution: this is not a recurrence to "speech" as the origin of
writing.  This is rather a belief that poetry is for speaking aloud
and that the reading of it in silence to oneself supposes at some
time a reading aloud.  The silent reading being about as complete as
the silent reading of a musical score.

I agree with James Sherry as to poetry and theory.  I also agree with
some of his rather noisy opponents that arriving at a fully
articulated theoretical standpoint (a whole book, a discourse) as a means of
generating poems at all is not quite what is wanted.  Nevertheless,
poems are written or otherwise composed by people who expect
something of the results and in that respect there is always a
theoretical intention.

I believe that it would not be difficult to substantiate the view
that Lang-Po was concerned with theory, because
of a seeming denial by many poets in the 70's that they needed to
reflect on their theoretical positions, and the belief that as a
result many 70's poets were becoming ineffectual as poets.

This comes from someone who in recent terminology must be counted
as of Generation Minus One, but with sympathies in the later 70's and
1980's for G1 AND ALSO for a lot of G Minus One and Minus Two poets.
(And Minus 3,4,5,6....)

I thought this all could be done with a lighter touch, around
questions of Hokey-Tokey, -Pokey and -Cokey.  But I guess
the above heaviness is a necessary resort.  Should I put this down to
the present employment of  poets teaching Graduates instead of
Liberal College Undergraduates?

My wife, like her father, is for Tokey.

I always catch my self saying poetry is a revolutionary force, within it
lies the potential and the means for . . . achieving a different world.
Then I catch my self again and say . . . but that faith, that belief is
that the faith of modernism, that art itself can be a temporary stay
against chaos?  And then I remember how Richard Rorty divorces the
personal visions from the aesthetic creations/ideas of particular
artists/intellectuals  because the types of change they desired would
abhor us.  And I am left in a dilemma, part of which is the question:
What sorts of change? And how or what in art provides for this course?

Hence, the postmodern.  And I think the unhappiness you mention, not only
about this situation but the inadequacy of theory to do more than
promulgate analysi, is a difficult position to be in.  It amounts to the
condition I've alluded to, of being in a position of needing to
distance oneself from the uses to which art (widely defined) been put and
which, also, doesn't simply reduce it to beauty and/or use.  I don't
know.  I guess my view is given some shape my hesitation to revert to a
position that reads/interprets art in some universalist-human-condition
variety of analysis/appreciation: we need better tools.  I share your
skepticism and hope for change (I'm alway interested in articulating the
specifics, especially with a term like this), it's just I worry about
harnessing art with such a responsibility as engendering change or being
coterminus (?) with it--especially after its failure to do so.

One last thought (for now): I believe it was you, Spencer, who made the
point of needing to stay on a general level rather than specific because
things (understanding? what was it?) tend to break down at that level.
Part of my reading of Emerson/Thoreau/Whitman (derived from Carafiol and
others) is that they are almost simultaneously able to move between such
levels--hence part of the power of their texts.  Which move me.  Which
encourage me toward change.  Perhaps we can compromise and articulate
some issues--especially change--at that intermediary level and how that
might be acheived through art.  Is this merging art and politics too
closely?  I wouldn't want to hold art to any relation to politics that
restricted it to performing such action . . . .  I've gone on long
enough for now . . . .

Thanks for chatting, Spencer.  Hope all is well on your end!

Yes, this is what I wanted to emphasize.  Emerson/Thoreau do this to an
extent I find stunning.  If we can't "rationally comprehend this
richness", though, Spencer, what sort of experience of art do we have.
Kind of an obvious question, I suppose, but....  And does this "richness"
have to do with change?  And is that change one of a "spiritual"
quality?  And if so does that experience of art exclude it from being
able to make the sorts of change you are interested in?

Alan--

Well I will delurk as a (prior?) Merrill reader--always used to do him in
my contemporary poetry course though front-end pressure and
special-topics orientation at grad level (G-1 at any rate) has meant I
haven't done so in a couple of years.  I never got as interested in all
the ouji board stuff as some said one should; The Fire Screen and Briving
the Elements where the books I liked best.  SOme of the ballad like poems
-- though more narratively unpacked--stuff like, is it, "Days of 1935,"
pick up on some of the demonic energies in Auden's terrific ballads in
very nice ways; Willoware Cup reminds me of Bishop's "Poem (about the
size of an old style dollar bill)"; and "Syrinx" is just plain terrific.
Auden too is prolly not a big favorite here, but  I learned mostly the
early Auden via Kenneth Koch at Columbia.  btw I've found myself looking
at Kenneth's stuff again lately, off and on, and wondering too about
what's interesting in NY School (or so-called so-called NY School) that
didn't get fully picked up on in LangPo: my divided loyalties and
surreptitious personal master plan in part.  more on this later; doan
wanna put my whole self in just now....

Subject:      What about the lurkers?

(... which provoked -- ?already-much-rehearsed -- musings about the
particular characteristics of these discussions, perhaps worthy of
consideration by those who take an active interest in the poetics of
discourse.)


The lurkers far outnumber a few decloaked, familiar voices which speak in a
brightly-lit space but remain invisible.

The voices of the speakers are emphatic, ringing with commitment; they
often are fractious.

The speakers appear to be speaking to each other. They do respond to one
another. There are always replies waiting for them from the other speakers.
The discussions become elaborate, self-refering, complex. The speakers have
time to consider what they will say -- time which does not seem to exist
for the lurkers, who simply hear by reading, now and then.

But the speakers are not speaking to one another. If they wanted to do
this, then they would simply correspond. They are speaking for the lurkers
and for themselves. They are publishing their voices. What they say is
uttered with the sense that they are overheard in the midst of their vital
discussions.

The speakers are not speaking. They are writing. Writing on the loosely
gathered leaves of their next book. One day their words will be edited into
shape. Before then they will be bound up and stored in an archive.

Occasionally the lurkers decloak and speak. Everything changes.


(... I'll resist the temptation to emerge from this mode of writing and
make any of the analytic comments that spring to mind. Leave it to the
lurkers?)

Q:  What's the difference between a good langpo
    and a tree?

A1: Nothing.
A2: Everything.
A3: The Answer, like the Question, is beside the point.
A4: The tree, unlike the langpo, isn't preoccupied with
    defining its position. It occupies it.

Take your pick. I like A4 (& not just cause it's longer).
Does theorize mean think about or write about what
you think about - or maybe do these things in specific
contexts or forums - as per this LIST.

If I ask, what makes me feel welcome here, what's my
qualification being here (apart from the gender
and de-lurker invitations, which are lovely and
help), I'd say it's cos I'm interested in intellectual
discussion, specifically langpo-type speculations.
This of course means I like the company, very much,
even if I don't know the quality of your social or other
lives.  Right now, don't care.

So, it's a kind of community - I mean, there are
commonnesses operating huh, of interests, of reading,
of a pleasure in theorizing. Of stimulation and the
pleasure - yeah maybe power too - of expression.

Poetry and its theorizing I think don't have social
or political or what have you functions.  Maybe the sense
of responsibility
comes from the feeling that we owe our patrons, now
that our patrons/the market are in good part the
state, hence society.

I mean, it's opportunity and proclivity that connects
us. What are the personal costs agains the pleasure of
being on the LIST - does it come down to being a
university-sponsored, mail- (oops, male-) dominated
thing.

The loop that leads back from such theory to its
sponsoring society must necessarily get mediated beyond
recognition,
it's dishonest to claim responsibility for ourselves.
At most, such responsibility is an indirect thng.

Now maybe it's the processes of mediation running too & from
langpo and its theorizers, job appointments, books
published, conferences, earnings, what have you.  But
theory has to do with what it theorizes, in this case
literary stuff (&itself).

It seems to me typically literature doesn't do well
patronizing the patron.


By the way, Tony, with the place you give sound/voice in
poems where do you leave someone who just happens not to
have heard poetry aloud, or a deaf someone.  I can't
see the disadvantage.
Surely one sensitivity being blocked serves well to
open others?

Dear Don Byrd,

I'm very surprised that you have no awareness of the downside of poetic
theory, that you "can't imagine why one would not want to use all the
tools that one might have at hand." Poetic theory, like all art theory,
is used more as a weapon than as a tool of creation. Even if you disagree
with the word "more" in that sentence, surely you're not so naive
as to think this theory is only used to help with creation.

Respectfully Yours,

Spencer Selby

P.S. Wanna trade publications (so we can see all that subtlety we've both
been missing)? I'll send you a copy of my antitheory nonbook if
you send me a copy of one of your most useful, optimistic tools.

Subject:      Thoughts on Theory

Just spinning off Spencer's latest post (hi, Spencer!), I sense that much
about theory (I fear I point to an abstraction rather than to any certain
individual viewpoint) risks treatment as commodity, rather than as the fluid
thing it is.  The dance of interplay between theory and practice means for me
that there is always something to enjoy, closer to infinite ways of looking
at a single entity.  It is as though one should not (consciously) stop, for
fear of giving the nod to gravity and then falling for who knows how long.

The pleasure of theory is certainly one of its big selling points, in
addition to its power to locate, frame, describe, attune to resonances not
previously picked up.

FACT CHECK: VOTES NEEDED TO KILL AGENCY
INITIAL REPORT FROM WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY
MARCH 14 / ADVOCACY DAY
FEBRUARY 28 / NY ARTISTS OPPOSE CONTRACT
THE ART OF PRACTICE: A RESPONSE FROM HENRY GOULD

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FACT CHECK: VOTES NEEDED TO KILL AGENCY?

Can anyone out there confirm a point of Congressional procedure for us?  We
have been told that it takes 218 votes in the House and 60 in the Senate to
abolish a federal agency.  Since it appears the opponents of the NEA/NEH do
not have those numbers, it would be cause for optimism if this is true
(though of course the specter of an agency with no budget continues to
loom).

INITIAL REPORT FROM WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY

We traveled out to Middletown, Connecticut last night to attend the event
organized by AJ Weissbard at Wesleyan.  Roger Mandle (President of RISD)
and George White (Eugene O'Neill Theater Center)--both members of the
National Council on the Arts--spoke for about 20 minutes each, after which
questions were solicited from the audience of approximately 150 people.

Mr. White, who started the O'Neill Theater in 1964-65, emphasized the role
of federal funds in supporting "young" institutions.  He noted that while
the loss of NEA funds would lead to 5 new plays and 2 musicals/operas being
cut from the O'Neill annual programme, the impact on less established
organizations would be more drastic.  Faced with a shrinking base of
corporate and foundational support, organizations that facilitate
innovation and experimentation would be driven under, leaving only the
"no-risk" institutions (Symphonies, Orchestras, Ballets) intact.

President Mandle used his speech to attack the "narrow corridor" of thought
being imposed by NEA opponents.  Switching with great facility between
aesthetics & economics, Mandle argued that the arts are a "strategic asset"
in the post-industrial world economy. Answering a frequently heard argument
that since the NEA is of recent origin it can be eliminated without unduly
affecting the nation's cultural life, Mandle noted that the automobile is
also a fairly recent development but no one suggests that we eliminate it
and go back to walking.

Both Mandle and White emphasized the role that "design" plays in the lived,
material environment of people who might not encounter art in other ways.
Both men also called for increasing the visibility of Endowment support as
a way of countering the conservative strategy of seizing on controversial
exhibits and presenting them to the public as typical of what the Endowment
does.  White suggested that plaques acknowledging NEA-support be
distributed along with grant-monies and displayed everywhere that NEA money
has been used.


FEBRUARY 28 / NY ARTISTS OPPOSE CONTRACT

(Anne Burt of LitNet forwarded the following press release yesterday.  As
it happens, the Senate vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment--a key
component of the GOP Contract--has just been set for the 28th as well.)


For Immediate Release, 2/10/95

A Gathering of Artists in Opposition to the Contract On America Featuring:

Homer Erotic, Tuli Kupferberg, Emily XYZ & Myers, Bartlett, Matthew
Courtney, John S. Hall, Todd Colby, Edwin Torres, Miguel Algarin, Eric
Drooker and Others.

Event will be hosted by Reno.

On February 28th at 9 pm, artists against the Contract With
America will assemble for an evening of readings, rants and riffs at The
Fez, below Time Cafe, located at 380 Lafayette Street in Manhattan.
Artists scheduled to perform include:  the all female rock band, Homer
Erotic; Tuli Kupferberg, the self-defined non-traditional anarchist, poet
and cartoonist; Miguel Algarin, co-founder of the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe;
spoken word artists Emily XYZ & Myers Bartlett; Sine regular Stephan Said
and many more.  Admission is $5, with proceeds to benefit the Literary
Network, an organization founded in 1992 to support a strong, uncensored
National Endowment for the Arts.

This event is designed as a visual and vocal protest against the
conservative agenda proposed in the Republicans' Contract with America.
The goal of the evening is to celebrate artistic freedom and diversity as
well as build community and unity in the face of an intended dismantling
of civil rights and social services.  As artists and members of arts
organizations, we want to draw attention to the critical issues of
censorship and disappearing funding.  Anne Burt of the Literary Network
will be on hand to distribute action materials, including postcards to
Congress and names of government contacts.

For more information contact:
Brenda Coultas (212) 674-0910
Stephan Said (212) 254-0571


MARCH 14 / ADVOCACY DAY

The American Council for the Arts (ACA) has targeted March 14 as a
"National Call-in Day for Art and Culture."  They are encouraging
organizations and individuals to make the case for continued federal arts
funding either by traveling to DC for in-person meetings with Congressional
representatives or by calling/faxing/wiring.

ACA is recommending that each interested person involve at least five
colleagues, friends, relatives (etc.) in the day's effort.  You can get
more information by calling ACA at 1-212-223-2787, ext. 227.  Their street
address is: One East 53rd St, New York, NY 10022.


THE ART OF PRACTICE: A RESPONSE

Henry Gould, a poet, participated in Freely Espousing-Providence.  What
follows is an excerpt from his response to some of the questions we posed
on 2/15:

Maybe one thing artists could do is "build coalitions" in SPECIFIC
COLLABORATIONS of agit-prop, Federal Theater 30's-style political work.
Some will claim that art has been over-politicized & ideologized now for
years - with a lot of pseudo-political art & pc one-upmanship.  But with
the attack on from the right, this could paradoxically reduce the
polarization -by drawing political art more toward the "center".  As I see
it the path to this is through a basic identification: the attack on the
arts is THE SAME THING, is PART OF, the general agenda of social & cultural
impoverishment underway - the downsizing of America, as gov't at all levels
(witness Giuliani's turn in NY) abdicates
vision & follows the dictates of the "world economy".  This is a very basic
position, but the agenda of a collaborate art strategy might be to "figure
it out", allegorize it, narrate it, re-discover it.  That is, in the spirit
of the living newspaper of the thirties, let's look at the demographics of
class disparity in this country - between super-rich, white middle class,
working
poor, minorities, very poor, & homeless - then look at how this relates to
the economics of private corporate & institutional & professional power IN
COMPARISON with public (government) institutions.  Out of this research
will come a perspective on how the malign indifference of the rich, the
mechanism of global markets, the resentment & ignorance of the middle, and
the venality
of commodity-art all TRANSLATE into feeble, tight-fisted, self-destructive
government.  And it will culminate in a recognition of personal
responsibility - including that of selfish artists -to make democracy part
of an over-all just & compassionate civilization, in a world currently
subject to tyranny & terror
on an even worse level.

To summarize: let's make solemn, collaborative political theater-works
presented very directly & openly as challenges to the Contract on America,
which provide evidence that the philosophy & activities of present &
planned government at every level DO NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF PUBLIC GOOD
for civilization, & challenging those who block these standards from coming
into play. I think artists could possibly build some authority by MAKING
ART ABOUT THE GENERAL
PROBLEM rather than by simply DOING POLITICS TO PROTECT ART FUNDING. (It's
not a matter of choosing one or the other, though.)

Hi Kali Tal, and thanks for the TNC address.

Last thing I bought by Gill Scott-Heron was 'Message To The Meesengers'. I
play it a lot at the moment. Why?  -  because of the texture of the voices,
because of what he's saying and who he's addressing and because (above all
for me) I think he has a fat and frank and direct talking 'tone' (exactly
not Alan Goulding's e-mail tone problem) that engages my listening. Brings
here somthing between Tony Green's re-statement of Bunting's advocacy'I
have set down words . . . to trace in the air a pattern of sound  -  Poetry
must be read aloud', Ira Lightman's call to pay attention to the 'musical
phrase' and your own bringing of poets such as Ice-T and Gill Scott-Heron
(among many many others) out of and into, from the root to the source of
the rap, dub and broad oral traditions, into the POETICS list discussions.

Having said all of which by way of introduction I then get a little nervous
-  because several slippages are at work here. Not least any definition of
'musical phrase' and thereby a discussion of a breadth of cutting music
practice in popular market and independent market spheres around which it
might be difficult to form a concensual definition of any use  -  even were
such a thing desirable.

I wonder how open listening is in the present? How far nuance has to become
blunted before readings can be shared? I was very struck by your comments
on the literature of trauma and -

>   the failure of language ("You *can't* understand!") and the desperate need
>   for language to succeed (You *must* understand!). Revolutionary poets yearn
>>   to write with such strength that their audience is traumatized as they
>have >   been traumatized (Jones/Baraka raging that "poems are bullshit unless
>they
>   are / teeth or trees or lemons piled / on a step," . . .)

You're right on ascribing documentary 'but never at the now' functions to
both "terrorist" and "revolutionary" poetry.

So, I'm curious. You oviously read this list, do you feel that the struggle
for the production of both constructive and critical meanings (maybe
simultaneously) whether for language or through language is irreporably
fractured into constructs of identity OR are you suggesting a need for more
pro-active polymorphous traffic? It's not intended as a 'trick' question by
the way.

There's been some allusion to trust in respect to various agendas over the
past few weeks here I'd say let's start from the position that -

we're all human beings and therefore not to be trusted (a sentiment
impressed onto me by Eric Mottram  -  and terrifying to some in its
honesty?)

Don't you just love this thing of posting privately and publicly. I do.

best

Dear Tony Green,

I expect something of the results of my poetry; anyone who is a committed
poet expects something of the results. But that does not mean I have a
need to formulate what those results will be, or necessarily mean. I may
anticipate those results, which is quite different from formulating them,
since my anticipation may involve a range of responses that need not be
explained or characterized in a theoretical way.

I am sorry if this post seems noisy to you. If so, look at it this way:
The theorists will probably take over this list again soon.

Kali--thanks for your remarks of late on "boy talk."  As someone who has
tried several times to engage the list in conversation, I wanted to
suggest that the question of "tone" is perhaps a gendered one.  I don't
want to over-simplify matters, but Deborah Tannen's model of male and
female conversations seems to work as well on this list as it does in my
freshman comp class.  I got on another poetry list, populated mainly by
new formalist fans, where women write in a lot--or at least two women
do.  But far less signifyin' is going on.

Several people, including one or two men, did contact me directly about
things I'd said; it would be interesting to talk about messages between
listees that aren't sent to everyone.  And now I'm doing it.  I was
disappointed, however, when I tried to bring "multiculturalism" into the
conversation, and discovered that these radical language poets, some of
them, are quite reactionary in their literary politics.

So I guess I'd suggest redirecting Golding's remark about tone; he
brought it up in the right context, but we were then swept right back
into boy talk.  More than needing to talk to women, they need to ask more
questions; Silliman's posting came rather late in the day.

Dear Sheila,

I'm all for the pleasure of theory. I read it and I get pleasure from it
and I'm sure it fuels my poetic practice. (Some of the best theory I've
read in past year is by one of the people on here that I've been "arguing
with.") What I don't like, what I have a big problem with is when claims
are made for the necessity of formulated theoretical positions on the
part of poets. When it is stated or implied that those who have not
formulated their poetics are "irresponsible" or in some way "misguided."

Thanks very much for your post, Sheila. I am interested in any
further thoughts you might have on this, or anything veering off from
this.

Spencer

On gender in postings, some here might be interested in Susan
Herring's paper, "Gender and Democracy in Computer-Mediated
Communication." The background to Herring's linguistic research:

-->        Since 1991 I've been lurking (or what I prefer to call
"carrying out ethnographic observation") on various computer-mediated
discussion lists, downloading electronic conversations and analyzing
the communicative behaviors of participants.  I became interested in
gender shortly after subscribing to my first discussion list,
LINGUIST-L.  Within the first month after I began receiving messages,
a conflict arose (what I would later learn to call a "flame war") in
which the two major theoretical camps within the field became
polarized around an issue of central interest.  My curiosity was
piqued by the fact that very few women were contributing to this
important professional event; they seemed to be sitting on the
sidelines while men were airing their opinions and getting all the
attention.

Some of Herring's remarks:

--> Recent research has been uncovering some eye-opening differences
in the ways men and women interact "online"...

--> My basic claim has two parts:  first, that women and
men have recognizably different styles in posting to the
Internet, contrary to the claim that CMC neutralizes
distinctions of gender; and second, that women and men have
different communicative ethics -- that is, they value
different kinds of online interactions as appropriate and
desirable.  I illustrate these differences -- and some of the
problems that arise because of them -- with specific reference
to the phenomenon of "flaming".

Anyway, interesting, I thought, given recent discussions.

Herring's full paper is available via the web version of the
Electronic Poetry Center under "documents" then "conversations." Use

agreed that the patriarchal system is in some way responsable
for underrepresentation in the discussion; but not (or not
only) because of technological access--last time i checked,
better than 20% of the subscribers to this list were female,
a percentage not reflected in the postings.  access to tech
is sure a factor, but the social (patriarchial) relations
seem to me more significant, and harder to address...

gross underrepresentation is a factor (20% is still gross underrepresentation)

another perhaps is the fact that women tend to do relevant things with their

Spencer,

I share your distrust of the current value of current cultural theory.  I
think a lot of people are sick of post-this and post-that. Why can't we talk
about theories that, on the surface, don't have anything to do with art?
 Like, does anyone know if the astrophysicists have figured out what a quaser
is?  What's up with string theory?  GUT?  T.C. Marshall, what's going on in
the world of flora?

Or I'd be interested to hear about prose composition theory.  We should get
Peter Mortensen on this list.  What methods are they teaching college
freshman to get essays down on *paper* (for lack of a better word).

I've enjoyed the p>q stuff, not that I pretend to understand it.  But it
makes me think about the Law of the Excluded Middle.  Joe, Jorge, could you
frame the parmenides verbally around the law of identity, excluded middle,
etc?  (I don't know what I mean.)

And I always like to listen to discussions about gender, but don't feel
*qualified* to expound.  What if all the boys just shut up for a month and
let the girls steer?

Given that at its extremities postmodernism turns its back on research as
an impossibility and as irrelevant -- Larry Grossberg is now claiming
that doing pure theory and only theory is now the most correct form of
political action -- it would seem to me the same fate would soon fall to
theory itself.

"Postmodernism" doesn't do any such thing, "postmodernism" doesn't do
anything; people do. And there is a good deal of postmodern research,
from Ann Kaplan's older work on MTV through Edward Soja and various
postmodern geographers.

I also don't think that postmodern has "extremities."

As far as the theory/poetry/poetics debate goes, it befuddles me. I don't
see where the _ought_ appears in any of this. People are invested in
different discourses, different modes of writing. So be it. It seems
dubious that any are primary; we're not after all dealing with an
axiomatics here, and the last seventy years have shown that even
axiomatics is full of holes.

What's been depressing about the debate is what might be seen an
academicization (pardon the word) of poetry itself. I would ask where the
solitary writer is focused on hir work, but that is always already
problematic in an email list fostering community.

I also read a piece in the Wash. Post that reproduced a couple of
quotes from the notebooks. W. wrote that the "Test of a poem" is
"How far it can elevate, enlarge, purify, deepen and make happy the
attributes of the body and soul of a man."

And in another passage that speaks to the concerns of this list he
wrote: "Every soul has its own individual language, Often unspoken
or feebly, lamely, haltingly spoken; but a true fit for that man,
and perfectly adapted for his use.--The truths I tell to you or any
other may not be plain to you, because I do not translate them fully from
my idiom to yours.--If I could do so, and do it well, they would be
as apparent to you as they are to me, for they are truths.--No two
have exactly the same language and the great translator and joiner of
the whole is the poet."

I'm taking it as read that all of that is intentional. And I ehol ehartedly
agree.

Slippage isn't the all of where it's at by any means.
It reveals the critical processual dance of the ungainly  -  (thinking on
its feet?, and falling through the potential of points to engagement).

Hi, Cris; Hi, Susan--

It is better, yes, to take the dance off the back-channel and perform in
public.  Posting is performance, a new kind of art; writing in motion, more
like improvisation in jazz than literary composition--skywriting,
lightwriting, sandpainting, here and gone, happening in time.

Cris asks:

>So, I'm curious. You obviously read this list, do you feel that the struggle
>for the production of both constructive and critical meanings (maybe
>simultaneously) whether for language or through language is irreporably
>fractured into constructs of identity OR are you suggesting a need for more

My answer is, Yes.  And this is not intended as a 'trick' answer. See,
nobody's got just *one* construct of identity:  I am this, but I am also
this, and this, and this, and this.  To be whole, we gotta keep moving,
shifting from perspective to perspective, so we don't leave any of
ourownself unaccounted for.  Each declaration of identity *is* a
"construct," and reflects only a part of the whole, so if we hold onto it
too hard, we lose the point, which is that constructs are useful, but that
they shouldn't, *can't* contain us. Language is the tool of our
fragmentation; at the very moment we describe "how we feel," we have already
left our whole selves behind, because the description accounted for the
feeling of the moment ago, but not of the now. Identity is a process, not a
thing.  So we need to counter the fractures with an attempt to create a
pro-active, polymorphous traffic inside ourownselves and between us and
others which takes into account both the necessity and limitations of
constructs of identity.

    i yam what i yam
    a world-changing fiction
    a trickster
    a chimera
    a heterogloss in my own time

And, Cris, I'd rather start from the position that we're all human beings
and therefore not to be trusted and to be trusted at the same time.

When Susan (hi, Susan) sent me her note backchannel, I urged her to post it
to the list because it seemed to me that she was saying exactly what needed
to be said out in the open. The question of "tone" *is* really important,
and those of us troubled by the "tone" of discussion on POETICS ought to
out-and-out *talk* about it.  (Thereby, perhaps, changing the tone.) It's no
accident that one woman (Susan) has brought up the issue of
multiculturalism, and another woman (me) has brought up the issue of the
(unintentional, but also unnoticed) exclusion of African-American, feminist,
and other identity-oriented poets from the discussion, and that there was
*no* response to either woman's post on the public channel.  Most white,
male enclaves are pretty happy to *stay* white, male enclaves.  And why
wouldn't they be?  But POETICS is *not* a white, male enclave, it just
operates like one.  So I figure that if the women here *quit* letting it
operate like one by entering into and changing the discussion, then we can
carve out some space for ourownselves, and begin to build a community where
some real exchange can start to take place.  Even in the worst case
scenario--the men ignore the women, and the women talk among themselves--we
can still *illustrate* that the problem exists by enacting it (and archiving
it) as a text.  Of course, that's a lot of work to expect already overworked
women to undertake, but perhaps, in this venue, such work can pay off.

What follows is a lengthy rumination about gender in espace, including some
excerpts from items I've previously posted on another list:

In January of 1993 I was part (perhaps even instigator) of a massive
flamewar on the TNC (technoculture) list.  The flamewar revolved around
issues of gender and women's voice in espace.  I learned a great deal from
this discussion, and I've gone back to the text files again and again,
coming away with something new each time. Juliana (pleased to meet you,
Juliana) writes that she "does not want the conversation on this list or any
other to have to be policed by some sort of affirmative action of response
or mention."  I agree.  Policing rarely works in *any* situation (doesn't
stop crime, does it?).  But I've noticed that what I fear more than policing
itself (since policing on the net is really quite rare) are *accusations* of
policing directed at those of us who dare to criticize the speech and/or
"tone" of others. (And, yes, this does resonate with the "political
correctness" argument the right uses to make the left appear more powerful
than it is...)  Like Juliana, "I do not want to be a woman all the time
either."  In fact, the ability to "pass" on the net is a real relief to me,
and I use it frequently.  But passing is just... passing.  What I'd really
like is for it not to be so exhausting to be a woman.  At any rate, let me
share with you a short piece which I wrote in the  middle of the TNC
flamewar, after suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous distortion
(accusations of being a wounded, vicious person, a manhater, blah, blah,
blah) and weathering what can only be called a storm of abuse, name-calling,
and red-faced fist-shaking.  (Not that I didn't dish it out as well as take
it, but then, that's the point I make below...)

Simultaneously amused and appalled by the narratives different male
listmembers were writing about "me" (the person behind the narratives, to
which none of them had any access), I explained:

"It is my pleasure in electronic communication to attempt to respond in the
style in which I am addressed, and, at times, to address the issue of style
itself.  Lacking physicality (obvious race/gender characteristics), I find
that it is simple to engage in stylistic shifts in espace, whereas it is
very difficult to engage in such shifts in person. One of the results of my
stylistic adventuring has been my realization that textual style is as
gendered and racialized as the physical body--though passing in espace is
easier than passing in person.  What I find, however, is that when I
publicly position my gender as female, and then insist upon "competing" in
"rational" (masculine) discourse in traditionally masculine terms while
simultaneously insisting we focus on issues of importance to women, all hell
breaks loose. The pattern is quite predictable: certain men will grow
completely infuriated and claim that I am attacking them because I hate
them. They will also impute all sorts of power to me--as if, in their eyes,
I "control" the discourse--"Kali's game"--and depict themselves as victims
of my rage..."

In fact, the upshot of the TNC flamewar, was that I was accused of being a
machine.  George Landow wrote:

"KALI TAL IS NOT A PERSON BUT A TEXT-GENERATING APPARATUS INTENDED TO PASS
THE TURING TEST AND AT THE SAME TIME TO EXPLORE THEORIES OF
SELF-REPRESENTATION AND PRESENTATION IN CYBERSPACE."

I don't think George really understood what a really nasty shot this was.
He took a long time to explain *why* I must be a machine, ranging from the
fact that I wrote too much too fast to be human, to reducing my posts to an
alleged "decision tree," to the outrageousness of my name (which, amusingly
enough, is actually the name on my birth certificate), to claiming that my
arguments were rational only if I was "part of an experiment to convince
other participants that this digital text assembler is a real person."  The
last part of Landow's post was a rumination on which particular TNC
listmember had "written" me.  The irony, of course, is that I truly *was*
trying to convince the TNC audience that I was a *real* person. As I am
trying to convince you.

To end the TNC flamewar, I admitted to being a construct, an Artificial
Intelligence produced by some grad students in the History of Consciousness
program at UC Santa Cruz.  I also pointed out:

    that if a machine speaks/writes to you
    and says it wants to be treated like a person
    it would be a good idea
    to take it seriously.

I think that there are people out there who are still confused about whether
I actually exist, either in human or machine form.  All the trouble was
caused (is always caused) by my attempt to inscribe my gender in my texts.
And as I've mentioned, these days I don't post much anymore.  I've posted
more to POETICS than any other list (including SIXTIES-L, where I am
listowner) in the last year.  I am curious about this space, and what
will/can happen in it.

Thanks to Steve Shoemaker for passing along the full Reuters text on Whitman

Tom Beckett's recent release of INTERRUPTIONS, issue #2 includes wonderful
work by Peter Ganick, "untitled (the text)" that I believe to be generative
as regards the recent talk on theory and practice. No paraphrase of the piece
could begin to do it justice (partial definition of work within a medium

Jorge's comments suggesting that women use their time (more) wisely helped
bring to mind a few responses I have to the entry of the  list into my
sphere.  I'd hesitate on conjecturing any firm relationship between what I am
about to say and my gender. Let's just call it one person's fraction of
response:

I tend to devote considerable time to reading and making texts, as do we all.
 My long-time career in business/organizations has necessitated my clevering
along and managing to eek out time during conferences and the like to do two
things at once, i.e., listen to a presentation and capture notes PLUS
scribble up a draft that seems just right for just then.  And airplanes and
hotels are gifts.  I love that quiet, which I always use.

Hometime during nights has been prime time for writing, too, despite packed
weeks whose days overflow into the softer hours.  The attention required to
absorb and then respond to what is on the list is potentially extensive.

Even before the gender contribution patterning discussion came up, I found
myself fiddling with how I wanted to approach all this.  I've always
corresponded extensively via trad post.  And therefore welcome opportunities
to be neighborly in new ways.  Funny how the physicality of trad
correspondence comprised just a few steps too many for most people to carry
out.  Now many more are willing to go into long discussions, which I value,
but for which I hadn't quite formulated a time/space segment in an already
busy schedule.

I think that someone mentioned earlier (much earlier) that we've not begun to
use this medium up to its potential in regard to sharing work. I was
delighted recently to receive a lengthy piece via the net.  And treasured the
late night read of that.  Perhaps such a pattern would spark whole new worlds
of interest on the list.

Kali Tal--Just getting this out, following delay.....  Just so you know, I
admired your first posting (into the teeth of the self-serious
"revolutionary" poetry mainstream) enough to have saved it on my hard drive,
a rare thing for me to do, even rarer when I don't recognize the name of the
poster. I'm sorry you interpreted the silence as not being heard.  I suspect
(at least it was so for me) that some of the silence was the nodding yes of
heads.

I also want to thank you because you gave me some discussion material for my
class this past week.  I'm in the very difficult middle of Invisible Man with
my class (its length combined with its denseness making it a uniquely arduous
literary experience for many of my students, who aren't used to being asked
to read 600 page novels), having been working through a number of different
issues with that wonderfully rich text.  We dealt with invisibility at some
length last week, but I hadn't considered a women's context.  You're right,
though, and I copied down some of your most recent posting to read to my
class.  They recalled how in chapter one, the naked woman and the black boys
fighting were both victimized, both objectified.

I too find it difficult to think of lang-po as revolutionary (back to your
first posting); though I think Bernstein's Content's Dream is one of the best
books of the last couple decades, and many others of the poets of this group
well enough; but how can you have revolution when hardly anyone knows you
exist?  Mark Wallace's recent posting reflects some of this not-mattering:
needing a theory to be heard.  But is a theory enough?  For Marx, yes, but he
was before television.  I saw a British documentary on rap the other day and
liked something Chuck D of Public Enemy said: that they were doing a sort of
media hijacking.  Now that gives the possibility of real change, turning over
of the known; people shout back, You're too violent, you're irresponsible,
but they are really threatened by the art, the newness, the
unintelligibility, the radical politics.

My comments in the freely espousing vein: I attached a column I'd written for
the Milwaukee Journal that basically argued that the arts were the only
politicized speech we have left in this country and that this was the reason
for the cuts, that democracy demanded dissent etc. etc.  But I think artists
suffer delusions of grandeur, myself included.  Yes, new works are
revolutionary in the sense of overturning the assumptions of mainstream
culture, of the political order, not partaking in what the dearly departed
Guy Debord called "the existing order's never ending discourse about itself."
 But if that order continues on unabated, without missing a step, without the
brutal warrior in the black leather boots tearing Godzilla (or Gingrich)-like
through sense and humaneness even coughing at the dust mote he's breathed in,
in what tiny circle has that revolution happened?  (It must be very late at
night, because that's a very badly mixed metaphor.)

Yes, of course, Alan, postmodernism doesn't do anything, people do; an
old simple and irrelevant mistake. Does postmodernism have extremities?
I live surrounded by them, try to teach the students who etc etc.  Does
it have a range of positions?  Yes -- I consider myself -- I consider us
all -- "postmodernists" in the sense that we are all living in that
condition and try to make sense out of it, I use the theories, etc.,
etc..  But perhaps it takes getting away from poetry to see what's
happening elsewhere on campuses and in our society -- in a number of
academic programs, in fact -- including under Larry Grossberg here at
Illinois when he was here -- students are being taught that research is
impossible and unimportant, and they live what they are being taught.
Not to deny the great research bein g done by others, including the work
you mention.  Postmodernity is simply the flip, effects, side of the
changes wrought by changes in information technologies that have let us
describe this also as the information society, a view which focuses on
causes rather than effects.  The fact that you don't see all of the
phenomena and processes I see doesn't mean that what I see doesn't exist,
Alan.  Sandra Braman

de-lurks.  I wasn't going to say this--it seems so sexist, but I for one,

of committees to "do."  I don't usually have much time to do much more

lately--especially the mentions of Wittgenstein and Michael Boughn's
wonderful fracturing) and save away stuff for when I have more time (ha!)
or for when I need to think specifically about theory and would like to
pull up these conversations for that.

In the meantime, I would like say _something_.  So here it is.

re: Schultz' forwarded comments and the issue as a whole.
--For me the issue is one of analyzing or talking about
feelings rather than having them or experiencing them:
from a therapeutic perspective "flames" are analogous
to shouting, screaming, histrionics (used to be hysterics),
striking out physically, etc. as ways to avoid experiencing
feelings.  Some people are comfortable with feelings and
some are not.  From this perspectivek, gender is an
accidental correlation.
     "...it is this lack of complexity in confronting
 the methodological complexities of modernist
 thought that gives legitimacy to the charge of
postmodernist depthlessness, what Jameson
accurately describes as the "waning of affect":

I guess that I'm included in Kali Tal's statement that males didn't respond
to messages by women. I must say I haven't noticed anyone pick up 2 per cent
of anything I've posted to the list, about children's rights, ablism, or
AIDS activism. But then, if I may make a clearly signalled snide remark,
if the alternative is to co-opted into the movement one may be "carving"
(interesting metaphor), in the way that Kali Tal seemed to "welcome"
Juliana Spahr as an ally when Juliana Spahr was raising some issues Kal
i Tal didn't respond to at all, then I shall happily go back to lurking
from *all* sides of this discussion.

having had to clarify my comments several times backchannel, i
ought to do so here:  i _do_ think the under-reperesentatnion of
women subscribed to the list is a problem ( i sed 20%,someone
updated that to 18.5--a worsening trend).  but even among those
subscribed, until last week, women posted far less than 20% of
the traffic--that seems to me to be the more intractable problem.
the original formulation seemed to me say that the paucity of women's
voices was due to the lack of acces to the wire; but even given
access, women choose/are discouraged from participation. that seems
to me the tougher problem, _and_ the problem we have a chance
of doing something about

appologies if i was unclear

NEW FROM SUN & MOON


_Finite Intuition: Selected Poetry and Prose_, by Milo de Angeles, tr. with an
intro. by Lawrence Venuti, has just been published by Sun & Moon Press.  This
is the last selection in the book:


POETRY AND THEORY

The Greek _theoria_ signifies "reflection," but also "solemn embassy,"
"spectacle."  And perhaps there can be no great poet who has not had
theoretical insights into other great poets, who does not represent them on
the stage of a conceptual power.  Yet there is that pathetic mythology of the
poet who--devoid of this power--nevertheless knows how to "tell a story" or to
"dream," as if dream were the land where the thorn of intellect grows dull.
It happens that some line open the veins of their own thought until it is
beyond recognition.  But this clenched thought _must have been there_: only
then can the lines enter the region which it doesn't know!  This is delirium,
in the most distinct accent on the calendar.  Yet if those lines remain in
doubt, if they are worried about not having thought enough...how much unworthy
poetry of ideas is born from this worry...how many genuflections to
philosophers...ho many lines get cornered in the poetry of sensations.  There
should be no submission of theory to poetry, if they are Greek sisters.  And
no comparison, because these two strangers _must_ have loved each other.

Also just out this month from Sun & Moon:

MADE TO SEEM by Rae Armantrout

Rae Armantrout read this past week at UB, at the Poetics Program's Wednesday
at 4 Plus series.  Here is my introduction:

Rae Armantrout poem "Extremities" ends with the line "the charmed verges of
presence": and indeed her poems are charms, virtual presents.
      Armantrout's poetry is notable for it's precision and elegance, it's
seismographic ability to chart the slightest shifts of social register on the
city streets, in the suburban malls, and in the university corridors.  In an
early poem she writes "The smallest / distance / inexhaustible"  -- a poetic
credo of commitment to the specific scale of an unadorning everyday life,
words lived in their pajamas as much as their toupees.  "The smallest /
distance / inexhaustible" -- providing a reservoir of wry, wacky, wicked,
torqued and torquing observations, skewering any bloated send of proportion,
skewing lines of logic to make poems of sentient, radiant sense: returning us
to the pleasures of reflection and consoling, indomitable wit.

Kali, this is the sort of thing that the current discussions are making me
do (but then I've only been on e-mail for a month yet) - namely, drop you a
line to say that I very much appreciate your posting(s) and that although
I'm not so fat with time to reply at present I'll mull what you've placed
and try to make a useful response in the next few days.

I've just read new posts to this agenda. In your e-xperience is this a
common occurence? There does seem to be a mountain of frustration at not
having each others' every point and nuance picked up on and nourished out
in a spirit of love and care in case there's something valuable to be
found. I'm not wanting to sound overbearingly cynical. Whilst I don't
really disagree (hang on I'll prevaricate a little further  -  I don't
really quite disagree) with that mad utopia it's surely not possible to be
fielding all points on all agendas all the time  -  even between *all* of
us. I'd like to hear from others on that subject. Which gets to the what of
it? I'd contend that the issues being raised are either anathema to or
'minefields' for many? This is intended to be deliberately provocative. As
such they are met with either by silence or by changing the subject.

Possibility for cheap jokes miserably missed -

I'm curious if anonymity would help?

I know now that you're an 'and and' rather than an 'either/or' kind of
person. The list appears to be arriving at a perception of itself as a
problematically constructed game of club whispers. The message and the
agenda are continually and discontinuously migrating. The feeling is of
trying to listen to and be an active contributant to several conversations
at once at the same time as being alert to the shape of the flock as it
travels and grows. There's a bird (I think it's found in Kenya - and this
is hopeless but I just can't remember it's name, something close to the Red
Quilya) which flies in vast flocks, rolling forwards on a continually
breaking wave to the effect that there is a new bird effectively 'leading'
almost from moment to moment. Espace does provide the potential for a
'writing in motion . . . skywriting, sandpainting, here and gone, happening
in time.' as you rightly assert.

I'm addressing this to you but its content also addresses the list. Much of
the posting that I've read since being here seems broadly addressed. I tend
to read everything that's posted and enjoy the most conversational material
-  however oblique.

You're so right in that the List is no more than is being posted. Post
something else   -  that of makes a difference. Change might appear
continually discontinuous but better might come.

Several issues are hovering unattended even now as we don't speak -

speed of dialogue

tone - voice - identity

awkward silences (yeah I saw Pulp Fiction)

and we who lurk in disbelief

best,
cris

what about Pauline Oliveros, Hidegard Westerkamp (check out her _World
Soundscape Newsletter_) Diamanda Galas, Meredith Monk, Gayle Young,
the _DICE_ Collective, Elaine Barkin, Jin Hi Kim, Alison Knowles...

--- let's read Pauline Oliveros' _Software for PEOPLE_ & then "talk"
        about it: no gauntlets.

--- let's read Susan McClary's _Feminine Endings: Music, Gender, and
        Sexuality_ (Minnesota, 1991) & then re-visit Tom Mandel's
        comments on sonata "theory" / "form"

2.) thanks to Kali for her brilliant posts (readings of posts)
        & reference to Susan's post (re. multiculturalism)
        --- which I missed originally
--- which all reminds me of a paper I heard at the Hoboken-Russian-Talisman
        conference where one critic spoke of Howe-Johnson-Cage's "use"
        of Thoreau's "Indians" yet all the theory was Western European:

        what about Greg Sarris' _Keeping Slug Woman Alive: A Holistic
          Approach to American Indian Texts_ (CA, 1993)

        what about Diane Glancy's _Claiming Breath_ (Nebraska, 1992)

        what about Gerald Vizenor's _Manifest Manners: Postindian

I guess you are, if you are a male person and did not respond to messages by
women.

>I must say I haven't noticed anyone pick up 2 per cent

I am interested in nonresponse that is part of a larger pattern.  It may be
that nonresponse to the particular issues you mention signals an attempt on
the part of the POETICS community to "disappear" those issues.  Nonresponse
to those issues, however, does not indicate that my observations of
nonresponse to women as a group are inaccurate or insignificant.

>But then, if I may make a clearly signalled snide remark,

And why would you do this?  Why is a snide tone required?  Not that I am
surprised--women who bring up gender inequity in, ahem, mixed company, are
often treated to snide comments, as if we were, by our mere presence,
threatening and offensive, needed taking down a notch...

And whose "alternative" is this?  Your response is a nonresponse, it is not
directed *to* me, nor to any of the women who posted to POETICS.  Rather, it
is a summary dismissal based upon no apparent consideration of *any* of the
issues raised by *any* of the women; a declaration of freedom from
obligation to respond, as if nonresponse were a virtue; a rhetorical device
used by a fellow who would rather not say so baldly, "Hey, let's talk about
*me* for a minute." Since it does not include a constructive suggestion for
a new topic, I read it simply as a sulk.  I welcomed Juliana Spahr's *voice*
(hello, Juliana); whether she is an ally or not is no consideration of mine,
since I am not currently fighting a war or planning a coup. I *am*
interested in hearing more women's voices *and* more men's voices, even if
they are raised to disagree with me.

The role of curmudgeon suits some men well, though when *women* attempt to
play it they are most often redefined as witches, bitches, or shrews.

And it is very good to see the lurkers come out to play.

Dear Carl:
As a reader, friend, & publisher of bp Nichol's, I'm glad to have you
here. I encourage you to bring nichol issues out here, as I believe his
is a poetics vastly undervalued in America, if not in Canada, and that
his various approaches to theory, poetics, and writing involve a joy
which is rare and needed.

Dear Kali, Susan, Juliana, & all poetics list --

sometimes I think there is little response from men to some of what you
post simply because what you post seems clear & right, and we don't
always know what we're doing that makes the situation you decry so
difficult. We hope we're not guilty but know we probably are. I should
drop the we and say that I want to hear you. I think that what I've
learned about poetry & poetics in the last two decades has come more from
women than men, yet that the women's work has been comparatively
undervalued in various quarters.

perhaps it would be a good idea for the men to simply be silent for a
time and let the women on this list have the forum, although I also hope
dialogues (multilogues) of various sorts open and continue.

Jeffrey & Mark - Yes, much more music to attend, by "women of both
sexes," as Cynthia Miller likes to call them. What occurs immediately is
Ladonna Smith, most often heard with Davey Williams, "trans museq," etc.
Also approaches the limits of noise, but what a beautiful noise . . .

I realize I wrote in a poet recently, concerning bp Nichol, "a poetics
vastly undervalued in America, if not in Canada," and feel like an idiot,
because of course I should have said "in USA, if not in Canada," as, last
time I checked, Canada was still in North America, a geographical fact for
which I am grateful.

Oi, great list, Cris, but I was wondering about your inclusion of more
popular sorts of music.  Not that I have a thing about  making hard and
fast distinctions between the popular and  . . . what have you, but was
wondering what the criteria were for your list.  I just listened today to
a Requiem for Bosnia by an amazing composer (can't remember her name
right now).  Very interesting.

        One clarification: I didn't mean to suggest that I hadn't gotten
responses to my postings.  But it did strike me as interesting that I
received a lot of backchannel postings from women (and some from men),
some of whom rarely, if ever, send frontchannel messages.

Hi Jeffrey, it wasn't intended to (or pretending to) be an exhaustive list.
The criteria were  -  who can I think of right now sitting here, who comes
right to mind  -  a stretched diversity of practice  -  enough that some
will know as to become more curious about the others not previously heard
of  -  and
I'd hoped to:

swing into more discussion of exactly the issue you've picked up on
i.e. distinctions between 'high' art and 'popular' art
and bridge to the issue of cultural diversity.
as well as hopefully get to hear about other composers who I don't know

Also, and more ironically the suggestion that the list seemed homogenous
was to provoke those discussions. On what bases homogenous  -  surely not
merely beause they are all women>

I'll grant that some of the inclusions (I can't remember 'em all and don't
have the list out) such as Moe Tucker were deliberately more edgy. But as
co-creator on Velvet Underground 'classics' she's been instrumental in one
of those rarer moments when the illusory screen between the high and the
popular gets rent. OK so now where's Tina Weymouth, Kirsten Hirsch and many
many more -  I know I know it's cats out of the bag time just come round
again. Certainly with the African musics these distinctions barely exist.
Which is where some of this discussion would begin to open towards other
issues that Kali Tal and Susan Schultz are raising. But there's another
interesting issue here. Women composers are involved (admittedly in smaller
numbers than men, I'd guesstimate about the same kind of proportions as
exist on this list) in all fields of music - making. They combine melody,
rhythm and noise with as many variations as male composers. It's therefore
hard to begin talking about gender in terms of 'preference' field of music
and the extension can be made throughout not just art-form practice but
human activity. The problems of course have been prolonged patriachal
structure, disenfranchisement and repression of opportunity. What do you
feel about it?

Thanks for the contact. If you've others I should hear I be very happy to
get a return. As Eric Mottram has just been quoted as saying 'there's
nothing more exciting than something you don't know about'. Here's to human
ingenuity and curiosity.

best
cris

de Angeles implies that it's impossible to be a "great" poet (what does
this mean? will we see a series from Sun & Moon, an offshoot of the
"classics" series: "Sun & Moon Great Poets #___"?) if you don't have
theoretical insights into other great poets & go public with 'em.
(Assuming "who does not represent them on the stage of a conceptual
power" means "publishing" or "lecturing" or otherwise airing, publicly.)
If this is true--extending to include prose & drama--G.K. Chesterton's a
"great" writer (his book on Shaw's brilliant & original) but Gertrude
Stein, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, Clark Coolidge are only fair to middling,
despite the obvious influences these writers have had on poets & writers
working today. This is not to say Stein & etc. didn't have theoretical
insights into Whoever, but that they didn't--so far as I know--take 'em
public. If anything's a "pathetic mythology" it's this notion that a poet
MUST air his/her ideas, *as* theory, must create (& promote) a body of
theoretical work, separate from the poetry, in order to be taken
seriously. Stein's _How to Write_ and her _Lectures_ don't seem to me
separate entities, don't seem terribly different in approach or effect
from (say) _A Novel of Thank You_ or any of the things collected in the
Yale volumes. de Angeles' notion that theory & poetry are, MUST be
separate seems awfully reductive, as though one's poetry (or other
creative work) can't possibly include one's theoretical insights, etc. I
think the reason why language poetry has been so (relatively) quickly
embraced by academe whereas Stein, Loy, Barnes & Coolidge (& others who
didn't develop separate bodies of "theoretical" writings) were ignored
for so long has a lot to do with the possibility that people in academic
institutions aren't particularly good readers, *need* demarcations like
"This is Poetry" "This is Theory"--can't (for whatever reason) read Stein
or whoever and see that, indeed, she addresses what she's doing (& why
she's doing what she does) in the "creative" work. I respect people like
Coolidge and Tom Raworth who don't develop bodies of (separate) critical
writings in part because they seem to respect *me*, the reader, my
intelligence. "It's all there in the work if you've taken the time &
trouble to suss it out," they seem to be saying. This is not to say that
I disrespect those who *do* supply bodies of (separate) theoretical
writings; I don't. But, I'm puzzled by this notion that a poet, to be
taken seriously, *must* provide a body of critical work as well.

Subject:      An Ad for Spirits

I was communing with my friend CB the other day, an active lurker on
this list. He was curious about recent references to "global alcohol,"
which sound most hopeful to him, promising as they do an anaesthetizing
of the persistent pain he associates with aesthetics, from which he says he
suffers acutely--which is to say not prettily. (Likewise he maintains an
active interest in all manner of dull opiates, legal or not, which explains
why, when he was over here yesterday morning for decaf and the papers,
he skipped right over the Times magazine article on who's who in the
poetry world and went straight to the lushly illustrated cover story on
cannabis.) I asked him about his views on the poetry/theory thread.
After denying any easy parallels with the gender-talk thread, he said it
reminded him of the rumpus raised about a composer he used to know.

"'A guy who reasons so much about his art cannot produce beautiful
works naturally'--so some people *said*," he murmured, "thereby
depriving genius of its rationality and reducing it to a purely instinctive
and, so to speak, vegetable function."

(CB tends to be a bit oldfashioned when it comes to genius, greateness, etc.)
What about alchemical cries of Foul re creating art out of theory, I asked.

"An utterly wacky view. Critic into poet--that would indeed be a
wholly new event in the history of the arts, a reversal of all psychical
laws, a monstrosity."

But not vice versa, I prompted.

"On the contrary, all great poets naturally, inevitably become critics. I feel
sorry for poets guided by their instincts alone; I regard them as incomplete.
In the spiritual life of great poets, a crisis is bound to occur that leads
them to regard their art critically, to seek the mysterious laws that guided
them . . ."

It won't surprise the reader to learn that CB regarded the poet as the best
of all critics.

Then, feeling relaxed, we took a recent post to the list on this topic and
discovered to our surprise that it was actually an instance of skillfully
worded negative advertising. Follows our collaboration intended to
make this clear--though, as CB remarked, clarity isn't everything,
even when it comes to critics/spirits.

AN AD FOR SPIRITS

Every poetic "mope" (every "fruct" in fract) is imbued with and attacked by a
theoretical alcohol which both informs it and from which it does not separate
except in the haze of those who would create a transparent vodka simulacrum
where the pure is alcohol-free. Fortunately these isolated teetotalers are
not themselves distillers although some use the wassailability to reform their
misguided drinking habits. We have bottles which are embossed with throat
cultures and some drinkers and even some distributers pretend not to see that.
Draughts are not purer than toddies and unthinking mopes are the products of
both and as such do not exist in desolation, nor can they be distilled into a
salable spirit, although some use the possibility to formalize their
mislabeled poetics.

Good, I was too lazy to further the issue, but now it's been raised.  I'm
also concerned, though, that we don't repeat the problem of owning this
particular discussion to ourselves . . . .  You know?  I've been finding
it rather difficult to engage with the Boy Talk posts and not for the
lack of interest . . . until this issue ... made itself known.  Anyway:
it's very interesting the gender politics of music.  At least with lit I
believe there has been either a more concerted effort on the part of
writers/critics to bring/integrate/etc women into view.  And
traditionally there have been a great deal of women who wrote--something
should be said about the habitating of this interiorized space of
writing: diaries, notebooks, etc. that are very much part of an ecriture
feminine that does not necessarily have to translate into public voice.
Hm.  Nonetheless, writing has had, I believe, more of a gender equity
than visual arts or music.  Particularly the latter.  This is not to say
it has been blind where gender is concerned, but that writing seems to
have offered women more of an opportunity to create.  This is a point my
partner makes (who works for the National Museum of Women in the Arts)
when she talks about the different creative opportunities available for
women.  Art, she says, requires more than pen and paper--and that is a
major reason that women do not always have the opportunity to express
themselves.  Even so, they are often the recipients of a sexism that is
either unable or unwilling to engage their work with any degree of
critical engagement--except to write it off.  When it comes to music I
think the gender differences are even more striking than visual art--it's
almost as if the more one enters the traditional realm of HIGH ART the
less women are present.  And music, traditionally, has presented great
obstacles in terms of resources to producing it.  And to get around to
your point about the relation between high/low and diversity, perhaps
what is of particular value in the postmodern effacement of the
differences between high/popular that women now have as much access to
the means of production.  This is particularly important if we are
talking about the production of symphonic, orchestral, chamber, or
serious music (I realize the limitations of these terms, but I want to
specify my own interest in the production of women in this area--no
matter how difficult it might be to distinguish it from  ...).  I am also
interested in how women have made use of the tradition of western music
and its 20th century developments, to what purposes they are putting
serialism, cacophony, mixed mediums, etc and why these are not as
well-recieved as their male counter parts who make use of the same
tradition.

Requiem for Bosnia: Victoria Jordanova.  I hope I got that right.
Wonderful piece.

Thanks, cris, for the list. A few additions:

Najat Aatabou
Elis Regina
Julie Kabat
Sona Diabate
Sorry Bamba
Carmen Linares
Sanougue Kouyate

It may warrant noting that "composer" as used
in reference to a Western classical tradition
need not necessarily apply to traditions in which
the distinctions made between improvosation/
composition/ interpretation/ performance are
minimal, if imposed at all.
     It may also be worth noting the relevance
to poetics of  the above consideration.

     Anyway, good sources for some of the above
mentioned artists (and many others):

Stern's Music
598 Broadway
7th Floor
New York, NY  10012
(212) 925-1689

Original Music
418 Lasher Road
Tivoli, NY  12583
(914) 756-2767


Stern's is run by Ken Braun, who is one of the most
knowledgable men in the country regarding
African music, and their catalog is the best source
I've come across for both classical and modern music
from around the world.

Original is run by John Storm Roberts, whose book
"Black Music of Two Worlds" is an excellent introduction
African music on both sides of the Atalntic.


Hope this is helpful/ interesting, etc...

Nina Iskrenko, who was only 43 or 44 when she died, had one of the
sharpest wits I've ever encountered. She would have known exactly what
to make of the fact that her obit on this list and the one additional
comment on it thus far both occurred under the header "Re: Boy Talk."

Sheeesh, as Tali would say.

Readers who don't know Iskrenko's poetry should check out _Third Wave:
The New Russian Poetry_ edited by Kent Johnson & Stephen Ashby (Ann
Arbor: U of Michigan Press, 1992), with an intro by Alexei Parshchikov
and Andrew Wachtel. There are several excellent poems there and the book
is generally a good introduction to the entire scene in Russia.

Milo de Angeles gives the lie to himself. No sisterly love that. Rather,
theory takes a bow as your typical chauvinistic, patriarchical man,
who's more in love with his view of the relationship (his reasonings and
desires) than he is in love with his partner and what _she_ might have to
offer or teach.

The piece is illuminating after all.

Dear Spencer:

Thanks for responding. One does feel invisible around here sometimes,
even when decloaked. It's reassuring to be addressed occasionally
(like the holographic emergency medical officer on ST Voyager, I
just want a name) Anyway, I had some further thoughts about this
theory thread, which occasionally, it seems to me, threatens to
collapse into an absurdity of miscommunication.

It would be interesting to track the history of the institution of
"theory", especially as it replaced "philosophy" and "literary
criticism" as the acceptable form of explanation. People throw this
word around like they know what it means, but I just get more
confused. My own (admittedly limited) sense is that the recent
popularization of theory as an institution is based on a kind of
bastard marriage of Marxism and Freudism as they tried to hitch their
marvelous 19th century systematic architectures of revelation onto the
science bandwagon. From thence via Frankfurt, we sudddenly find
ourselves in the midst of a world in which something called
"under-theorization" has replaced certain "sins".

Papa Charlie (the absent father?) sends in his hit men (be they
jazz musicians or imported Euro-brains) to try and get the kids to
cool it by overwhelming them with the "obvious", as if this discourse
of "theory" itself were, what did James Sherry call it, "transparent"?
As if it didn't have a history. As if it weren't the center of a very
specific world, one in which "practice" (another interesting
institution) is "based on" certain abstract "principles" (Yikes!
shades of Plato.) What does it mean in 1995 to affirm a world that
looks like this? Does asking this question mean that I am
anti-intellectual, that I don't want to "think" about poetry, that I
just want to wallow in words like some kind of Romantic pig?

Well, given the responses here so it would seem.

Hang in there.

any of you want to konw about Language Poetry, read the New York Times

Gary,

Nice post.  I do feel stupid for not having a coherent body of theoretical
work.  No, I feel more guilty than stupid.

I like your point about the academy needing a good dose of marketing to pay
attention to certain trends:

>  people in academic institutions aren't particularly good readers, *need*
demarcations . . .

You've got to hand it to the Lang Poets, they know marketing.

but, really, how entrenched is an L-P writing method in the university?
 Could we come up with a location matchup and some market data?  L-P
infiltration appears to have been sucessfully implemented in Buffalo, UC San
Diego, San Francisco State, Brown, Sonoma, Simon Frazer, Albany (no),
Toronto?, Montreal?, and say 20 more campuses for good measure versus the
rest of the colleges and universities who offer writing programs.  That's
about 30 LPs versus ____ .  Can anyone fill in the blank?

Some thoughts (we hope) about theory and boy and girl talk and other matters,
prefaced by the disclaimer that I had a system crash yesterday and lost four
days' worth of posts and mail--so if I repeat what someone's already said, am
not responding to someone, whatever, apologies.

Bill Luoma asks a statistical question about the "entrenchment" of LP writing
method (a category I'd question, Bill, because I'm not convinced that there is
a method in the same way that there seems to be a workshop method, and this
absence of a "method" may explain what remains LP's relative academic
marginality--its absence of a monolithic method doesn't endear it to creative
writing programs. Whew--did that long parenthesis make sense?). But I'd fill
in your blank, Bill, with "100s." One could find out from Associated Writing
Programs. More generally, rumors of LP's academic entrenchment are (as Bill
implies) greatly exagerrated. Two points: (1) there's a distinction to be made
between establishment in the academic side of English Depts. and in writing
programs. I teach LP in academic English courses, but no one here exploits the
possibilities of its method(s) in creative writing courses. (2) This so-called
"entrenchment" gets exaggerated by LP's already entrenched opponents (a
strategy that parallels the right's strategy in the NEH/NEA wars and in other
fora--though I emphatically do not want to associate divergence from LP with
the right, which would be silly). I'm just saying that despite an emergent
body of criticism on LP, the increased visibility of particular poets, and so
on, still a very small number of writers who might be associated with that
increasingly amorphous-looking tendency are engaged in full-time academic
work, nor do I think that their work exactly saturates syllabi nation-wide.

On the recent theory exchanges: interesting that the theory discussion and the
boy/girl talk have been going on simultaneously but in parallel lines, without
much crossover. What's the relation between theory (the tendency to theorize,
the kind of theorizing that gets done) and gender? I'd like to hear from some
of the female subscribers as to their take on the theory discussion. Does
theory mean something to you (in "theory" and in practice) different from what
it means to male participants (I'm not assuming that I know what it means to
them, by the way)? I just have the intuition that there's a connection between
these two current threads that's getting suppressed or not talked about or
overlooked. Is it just coincidence that they're going at the same time, but
separately?
  Given recent posts like Juliana Spahr's referring to boy's talk about boy's
books, I suspect not. Y'all, as we say here in Kentucky, can let me know if
I'm off base.

Also: "theory" means something different to academics and to poets. I think
that what Spencer, James, and Tom have been debating as theory, I'd be more
inclined to call poetics. Or at least I'd make this distinction, which is an
institutional one, not an essential one: that in most current intellectual
debate, "theory" means a certain body of poststructuralist texts and thought
that, yes, obviously, is deeply tied up with the writing practice of many
people on this list, but that is used in the academy to marginalize poetry. Or
to put it bluntly, many more people in universities are interested in theory
than they are in poetry. So: I just wanted to (re)call to people's minds this
definition and use of "theory." LP has the wonderful power (as do Emily
Dickinson and Wallace Stevens) to interest people who are also interested in
theory. Sorry if this risks academicizing the whole issue unduly--just
reporting from the site where I spend most of my time.

To Sandra (Braman): I was shocked by your report of Larry Grossberg's claim
that doing pure theory (whatever exactly that would mean--I'm not sure--what
would purify it, and how would one assess its purity?) was the only meaningful
contemporary politics. I'd be interested to hear more about this, either on or
off line. On the surface it sounds like a kind of quietist reiteration of the
old arguments about the political efficacy of deconstruction, but maybe I'm
missing something.

Has anyone here read Viswanathan's new book about the history of
"literary" studies in India? Basic assertion that literary studies
in English began not in England or America, still under the classical
mode of learning, but in India where it was used to "Anglicize" Indian
subjects, ie, the teaching of English values through English literature
meant to "replace" their own culture, which was obviously devalued
as "primitive."
     My point is to suggest that if we want to historicize theory,
a very good idea incidentally, we cannot forget to do the same
for art, and for philosophy, and particularly not for "literary
criticism.""Any document of civilization..." etc.
     Thanks, Eric.

Hi, good to see you de-lurk, John.  I'll have to think about it,
since I'm on duty enrolling students this a.m.  I guess it must be
a problem of limiting cases that you've raised, rarely possible to
include these definitely, or exclude.  This position has to be
carefully looked into: it's about the process of thinking the text
read as something someone is saying.  If you were deaf, the usual
pleasures and frustrations will no doubt intervene. How about
pictures for blind people?  Theory would be hard-pressed to cope.

David,

In the last paragraph of "Cultural Criticism and Society," Theodor W.
Adorno writes:

Cultural criticism finds itself faced with the final stage of the dialectic
of culture and barbarism.  To write poetry after the holocaust is barbaric.
And this corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to
write poetry today.  Absolute reification, which presupposed intellectual
progress as one of its elements, is now preparing to absorb the mind
entirely.  Critical intelligence cannot be equal to this challenge as long
as it confines itself to self-satisfied contemplation."  (_Prisms_.  Trans.
Samuel and Sherry Weber.  Cambridge: MIT P, 1981.)

In Part Three of _Negative Dialectics,_ Adorno revised the statement.

Perennial suffering has as much right to rexpression as a tortured man has
to scream; hence it may have been wrong to say that after Auschwitz you
could no longer write poems.  But it is not wrong to raise the less
cultural question whether after Auschwitz you can go on living--especially
whether one who escape by accident, one who bu rights should have been
killed, may go on living.  His mere survival calls for the coldness, the
basic principle of bourgeois subjectivity, without which there could have
been no Auschwitz; this is the drastic guilt of him who was spared.
(_Negative Dialectics_.  Trans. A.B. Ashton.  New York: Continuum, 1973.
363.)

A few pages on: "All post-Auschwitz culture, including its urgent critique,
is garbage" (367).

          DEEP CYBERSPACE (AHP) - A 26-foot long tapeworm was caught
 by weary computing engineers yesterday, who claimed the foul-smelling
 creature had been feeding off the Net.  Now on display, the worm has
 turned a tiny Cyberspace village into an unexpected tourist attraction,
 the Co-Poetry News Network reported yesterday.
          Engineers ``netted'' the basking tapeworm -- biggest of its
 kind ever seen in the area -- and used ropes to extract it from a gaping
 terminal in Charles Bernstein's office in Clemens Hall at SUNY Buffalo.
 Bernstein, away on a reading tour, had left the terminal unattended and
 during this time the tapeworm -- nicknamed ``Benji'' by engineers --
 apparently nestled into an intractable position.  The tapeworm drew
 carloads of summer vacation tourists, said CNN, which showed children
 climbing onto the giant carcass and posing for snapshots.

loss--

greetings again.  i'm starting in earnest the task of formating
TRee into WWW--having finally gotten a web-capable connection &
getting a grip on what i'm aiming at.  i've prototyped the home
page & index pages, which i
'll send you fr input.  are you/the EPC still up for hosting
the documents??  i'm checking again, 'cause i'm beginning to
realize what might be involved...  & if yr still up for it, a
technical question: are there lenght/format restrictions on
the names of documents on your system?  that'll impact the
names i assign for links, so let me know...

basically, my general plan is to link the homepage to 2 directory
pages (1@ for zines & chaps), each of which will have alphabetic
subcatagories ("zines A", "zines B"...  "chaps author A"... etc);
each of which will link to the actual index for "Zines/a" "Zines/B"
etc...--then those indices will link to the individual reviews.
what this would mean, for you, is everytime a new issue comes out,
there would be a group of documents to add (one for each publication
reviews), AND the various index files (26@ for both zines & chaps)
would have to be replaced with new versions...  if this is unclear,
i'll send (on disk) the initial prototype.  if it _is_ clear, and
looks to be more than you bargained for, lemme know.

i'm kind of psyched to actually have documents coded & linked,
and daunted by the prospect of converting all the back issues
into the new format.  but i think it'll be pretty impressive
when done, and ultimatly may GET SOME OF THIS STUFF READ, which
is ov course the goal not to loose site of....  i'm curious, too,
if the mention in _Online Access_ had a noticable impact on
logins to the system--any statistics yet?

To eric, et al:
        It's good you bring up the view that all culture should be
historicized.  I've been reading Said's _Culture and Imperialism_ and the
point is not simply to historicize, but to point out that the supposed
greatness and fact of existence of European culture is made possible,
implicated to the highest degree, with the system of imperial/colonial
exploitation.  Beyond this, Said suggests looking at discrepent
experiences of colonial relations--texts from different perspectives on
colonial experience whose commonality does not efface their important
differences.  This is a rejection of a "pure" aesthetic realm; a
rejection of "humanism"; a rejection of "unitariness; and an imperative
to unthink the ridgid separation of politics and aesthetics.  One should
include theory in the latter, I believe, and, even, indict it on  the
same terms....  Just some thoughts.

Spencer Selby says:"I expect something of the results of my poetry; anyone who i
poet expects something of the results. But that does not mean I have a
need to formulate what those results will be, or necessarily mean. I may
anticipate those results, which is quite different from formulating them,
since my anticipation may involve a range of responses that need not be
explained or characterized in a theoretical way."

Dear Spencer,
         I would like you to look closer at "anticipation of
results", because I think you could find just there, thought that may
never be more than muttered to yourself, or even quite silent, but in
which something other than the poem to be written or the poem in hand
or the poem just written is saying, for example "Some other
person(s), whether living or dead, would like/not like
this, because...."  how is that not theoretical, that is dependent on
a stance in regard to others who will read or hear the poem.  Will it
"move" someone else in any way?  I would have thought that the use of
theory to poets was that in between writing they could sort out what
went wrong with the  last poem or what went right.  Between posts
(?poems) several people on this list are theorizing the post and the
network.
       What you seem perturbed about is the thought that poems should
conform to a prior encapsulation of right method(s) for producing
what has already been determined as "good" poetry.  Theory as
prescription is a worry, yes.  But that doesn't mean that poetry can
be disentangled from the theory that goes into the making of it.

Adorno was obviously a pessimist.  A cynic.  But did that keep him from
exercising his own critique?  Perhaps it is garbage, but there seems to
be an equal if not more pressing imperative/responsibility to

I met Nina once here in Providence last year. As Ron said, she had a keen
wit and a great sense of humor. She also possessed the ability to be, to
simply engage in conversation with a conviction that never once waivered.
At our very brief encounter I told her of a project I'm working on and
three months later, battling breast cancer, she sent four "poems for deaf
people" - drawings of the slightest filigree composed entirely of words.
They remind me of some of Michaux's line-work and captivate with a similar
drift between language and line, between cultures - so to speak. This
gesture provides a lasting tether. Here's one of her poems from
"Third-Wave" (pg 91) translated by Anesa Miller-Pogacar:

of sharply developed absurdism and carefully preserved principles of highly
artistic stagnation. Being accustomed since childhood to the paradoxical
phenomena of everyday life with theri unforseeable consequences, knowing
how to get my in the majority of situations without common sense or
psychological ease, with a strict immunity to all that can be had without
struggle, that wich is passed out one apice-all of this sooner or later
creates a corresponding supply of firmness, or, if you wish, a natural
conservatism, pritecting its bearer from simple decisions and direct paths
to even the most obvious truths, This healthy conservatism lays a
noticeable imprint on the stylistics and character of the depicted, and it
also explains-metaphorically at least - a cluster of phenomena that defy
more reasoned means of interpretation. Specifically, these are certain
facts of the "biography from the opposed." Having obvious inclinatins
toward the humanities-toward literature, musci, drawing, etc.- the author
nonetheless spends six years studying at Moscow University in order to,
having obtained a diploma in physics, never again to return to the natural
sciences, those ex-personal froms of interacting with the surrounding
reality; having selected, as primary orientation, the word, and as shelter
of necessity - the trivial pusuit of work as a translator of scientific and
techinical literature from English to Russian. A family and two children
convincingly fill out the picture of a normal existence for a Russian woman
in the contemporary literary process, an existence that was secret for many
years and even shameful in the eyes of others, to reveal itself only in the
past year or two with a few publications. Thus, it is not surprising that
the author accepts any signs of attention paid to her humble persona with a
certain dubiousness and perplexity; for this she offers excuses in the form
of gratitude, and gratitude in the form of a text whose rehearsal coincides
with its final result.

Just a brief reply, but I think it is a majoy misunderstanding to think
of Adorno as a cynic. A pessimist, certainly. To some extent a paralyzed
thinker, I grant. But not a cynic. A cynic gives in to the barbarity.
A cynic gives up the ever more problematic possibility of Utopia.
     Adorno had a hell of a lot of problems as a person and sometimes
as a thinker, but he was never a cynic.

Dear Mike:

        War bird decloaking at starboard.  I wonder if anyone has read
Sidney or Shelley's Defense of Poetry in the last 20 years?  I think
"theory" has taken the place of philosophy in the equation.  I used to
think it was pseudo-psychology in its reading of poetry and its authors.

        All lean toward the destruction of poetry's power as soverign
in human imagination.  Without the poets there is no hope.  We will
not be educated, consoled, inspired, loved or moved to action in this
brazen world - only the poets can deliver a golden (to quote a buddy).

        We all know who they are.  They are written on our hearts. Whether
alive or elsewhere they get the job done, usually alone, on the screen
or in the streets, curled up around a terminal or allowing it to fade "like
a sand painting at the end of day" their labors keep all of creation
going - otherwise all is entropy.  All else is A River of Ka-Ka sold at
a very high price.

        When I think of theory and Blake, I know he came to his in the
work - and when he found it he abandoned the Four Zoas to write Jerusalem.

        I believe every poet discovers "theory" in this way.  It reveals
itself.

        All hail the Poets.  They keep us free and laughing in an other-
wise dismal prospect.  Call me Post-Romantic.

Subject:      Re: theory and being heard

    Dear Mark (Wallace), in response to your claim of having to be a theory
    to be heard, what then do you have to be to listen? Do only theories
     listen to theory?
     In any event, I do not claim to find any comfort in the hegemony of
     "theory" in the academy, and I do not intend my response to be "flip"
     and "merely rhetorical" but "THEORY IS POETRY IN DRAG" can, as a motto,
     approximate a perspective a legitimate (i.e. IT PAYS) tradition is
     (re)-forming around, regardless of ruptures that on an institutional
     level are reinscribed into what becomes read as a "debate."
     I am trying to avoid the cynical resignation in the face of a compartment-
     alized view of the world. For such "resignation" simply perpetuates it.
     And if I may lapse for a second an indulge myself in a freudian metaphor,
     isn't it possible, Mark, that sometimes what seems more like "theory"
     than "poetry" actually falls more on the "side" of the intrinsically
     motivated ID rather than the extrinsic SUPEREGO? And thus, ocassionally
     if you didn't DO POETRY you'd be out of a job? Or is this just a matter
     of interpretation on my part....
     As for Alan Golding's rewording of what many have called "theory" as
     really POETICS, which he claims is an institutional rather than
     essential distinction, that doesn't seem "accurate"--for "academic
     theory" only becomes poetics if put into dialogue with poets and
     or poems... Granted, we're on a POETIC list, so we can claim we're
     some kind of hermetically sealed interpretative community gathered
     around some transcendental signifier BUT isn't the question to some
     extent the idea that there exists this THEORY which in itself is
     HOSTILE to poetry, in a way quite different from "poetics" is...
     Now, this "hostility" of course brings in the whole question of
     whether thinking binary is a CAUSE of cultural disenchantment or
     merely a rhetorical exercise to show off one's "wit" with not externAl
     ramifications in the "real world"--And thus, that dreaded question
     of TONE becomes raised again in a piece of writing (this) that is
     marketable NEITHER as theory or poetry, and then one wonders if there
     is communication only with commodification, and I drank another dollar
     to quench my thirst for anti-naive-vulgar organic humanism (which
     of course is really really really what we all want "underneath it all")
     All of my love, Chris

Dear Alan and others--
Susan Schultz and I discussed the boy/girl issue in Hawaii two weeks ago
and I brought it up when Ron Silliman,  Lyn Hejinian, and Leslie Scalapino
were here for the Ginsberg censorship affair last week.  Interestingly,
Lyn and Leslie say they never see the poetics net; Joan Retallack tells
me the same thing and I guess in general we girls just don't do it as much.
Why? (1) as one correspondent wrote in, we DO have too much to do. I don't
see how the men have the TIME to write endlessly back and forth.  and (2)
this mode of communication is somehow unsatisfactory to women.  It really
IS a gender issue, I think.  I like to write to someone, not everyone/
anyone.  A mode of address.  A form of life.
Writing to those "out there" is somehow unappealing, as Kathleen Fraser was
saying the other day.
So: it's great for messages like, "What is the title of that book?" or
here are three conferences coming up--a bulletin board.  But beyond that?
well-I think we'll let the men go for it.

Another topic (here it's useful): who IS Dinitia Smith, who wrote that
article?  She never contacted me but I did get a call from the photo dept
asking for a picture.  The dept. here sent it and then they called back to
say sorry, they could only use "one in every category."  I was so glad the
cartoon wasn't of me.
Where did she learn of her "language poets"?? I wonder who was her source of
information?
Bye, men!

To eric, et al:
        It's good you bring up the view that all culture should be
historicized.  I've been reading Said's _Culture and Imperialism_ and the
point is not simply to historicize, but to point out that the supposed
greatness and fact of existence of European culture is made possible,
implicated to the highest degree, with the system of imperial/colonial
exploitation.  Beyond this, Said suggests looking at discrepent
experiences of colonial relations--texts from different perspectives on
colonial experience whose commonality does not efface their important
differences.  This is a rejection of a "pure" aesthetic realm; a
rejection of "humanism"; a rejection of "unitariness; and an imperative
to unthink the ridgid separation of politics and aesthetics.  One should
include theory in the latter, I believe, and, even, indict it on  the
same terms....  Just some thoughts.

         SAN FRANCISCO (AHP) -- A cyberzoo can take its toll on
 even the toughest old birds, and these birds were never very
 tough to begin with.
         Forty-four ``light-winged Dryads of the trees'' have
 fallen dead silent; a population that once reached 44 is down
 to four.
         ``It would appear ... that it's the wrong zoo for the
 species and, indeed, it's no doubt the wrong species for zoos,''
 said Kali Tal, president of the animal rights group Hungry
 Generation.
         But generalizations are difficult. For instance, these
 particular nightingales share neither habitat nor coloration.
 They come in all shapes and sizes. Some call Hawaii home, some

 hail from Buffalo. And their song is not necessarily the same
 one heard by ``emperor and clown.''
         In fact, the unusual braying sound has earned the birds
 a nickname from snide zookeeper Ira Lightman -- ``jackass
 nightingales'' -- though others describe the sound as more like
 the coo of an angry dove.
         But why are the birds so stressed?
         For one thing, there are well over five males competing
 for the attention of one female, a panel of experts noted.
         For another, unknown predators have gotten into the feed
 lines and parodied several of the nightingales.
         And instead of a big, blue sky to parade in when they get
 hot and bothered, they have a 1-foot-square screen.
         Still, said Kali Tal, relenting in her earlier pessimism,
 ``birds do just fine on other lists.''
         A panel of experts made their official recommendation this
 week in a memo to head superintendent Charles Bernstein. According
 to a secret source, the memo urged a shutdown of ``Poetics@ubvm,''
 and immediate dispersal of the birds.

         ``The nightingale issue has gone beyond what is in the best
 interest of the nightingales, and I want to refocus on their welfare,''
 said noted animal rights activist Liz Willis.
         List spokesperson Alan Golding acknowledged the ``bird
 talk'' program has had its ``ups and downs.''
         ``We're out of kilter right now, definitely out of kilter,''
 he said.
         Noted another expert, Juliana Spahr, ``The problem is the
 concept of aviaries itself, you know, birds perched on swings. We'll
 have to do away with the whole `polly wanna cracker' mentality if
 we want any actual change.''
         The last time activists got so upset at the zoo was in 1994,
 when Betina, a 5-ton bull elephant, died after being tranquilized
 so she could be caged for shipment to a more suitable list.
         Most of the nightingales died of diseases that were
 aggravated by stress due to boredom, competition and malnutrition,
 the panel said.
         Poetics has tried to give the birds more ventilation in
 their tiny pens by installing a new subject line and cutting

 back on brashness. It's also considering zookeeper Mark Nowak's
 recommendation that other species of birdsong be piped into the
 aviary.
         And it's looking at easing the gender pressure by boosting
 the population to include as many females as males, consultant Cris
 Cheek said.

Hi Tony, and it's a cheep cheep
from the chirpy
over, "here, here!".

                Of course your take on 'theory' and 'poetry' does presume
that everybody writes poems with a reader 'in mind'. Or, splitting it down
more to further -  a reader Other than Them Selves. But even a dialogue
within Them Selves' work will produce the intimate inter-relations you
articulate.

>this, because...."  how is that not theoretical, that is dependent on
>a stance in regard to others who will read or hear the poem.

                At heart (I'm recently reconciling myself to using what I
saw before as a centralising anatomical reference but now re-emphasise its
decentralising function, from the left) poetry is social (interpersonal and
yes political) in a most challenged sense.

                The issue which has been mentioned several times here is
that of voicing, reading out loud  -  which seems crucial to this
discussion. It makes a useful bridge (I'm always up for building 'em) to
issues of composition and to oral - improvisatory traditions and innovative
oral - improvisatory 'practice' (surely it's always practice, however
'accomplished it gets - that's its edge which admits process - is process
an institution?).

Having said which I would also be disturbed by what you describe as 'poems
being written in order to conform to a prior encapsulation of right
method(s) for production'. That way lies closure. But is anybody on this
list proposing that?
I've read no evidence of it.
Thanks for your post  -  it may have wafted the smokescreen a touch.

I.m worried that there is an idealism footloose with the fancy that's
chirping a hymn of variation  -  too whit:

'there is a theory far away, without a city wall'

love and love

This mode of communication is not unsatisfactory to me -- and
ain't I a woman?  It's not perfect, but it's not a bad substitute for
a real live community.  After just a few posts I've made several
valuable personal connections via this list.  Gone are the
strictures of geography and social placement.  My interlocutors
are not limited to people I know, hence "internet" --  a "form of
life" -- a cocktail party where everyone's invited, and it
doesn't matter what you wear,  just as long as you are there . . .

Not to attack ad feminem, but it's one thing if you are a
tenured person  of power at a major university with a brood of
influential books -- you don't need a forum.  I do.   I don't have
time for or invitations to all those conferences.   I am not in
close proximity to good English-language libraries or small
press  bookstores.   Usually when I hear my language spoken
it's work-related or expat gossip or badly -translated news.  Or
the beautiful flawed pidgin from my students.

And if writing to those "out there " is unappealing, why not
just write letters?  Why publish anything?  No desire at all to
ripple the pond?  Trace your subjectivity?  Make your voice
resound?  Of course you want to do these things -- Marjorie,
Kathleen, Leslie -- or you wouldn't be in the positions you're in
now.  You (especially Kathleen) would not have made it
possible for me a generation down to say what I'm saying right
now.  All the net's a stage!  And the men are all the players. . .

 Letting  "the men go for it" is  the waste of a medium, the
waste of minds, a passive knuckling-under, tantamount to
letting the men make wars, oppress people, and argue
themselves into nightmares of sophistry.  So I will agree that
"it really IS a gender issue," but not in the way you mean.

So I send out this call to my good and strong aunts  -- if you
speak here, you make space for me (and my sisters -- pardon
the 70's-ish rhetoric) to speak here too. You'll also make the
discussions decidedly more interesting.

Dear Alan Golding & everyone:

The discussions re: "boy talk" and "theory" *have* crossed over: In my
original post, to which Bill Luoma was responding, I'd noted that
Gertrude Stein, Mina Loy and Djuna Barnes didn't provide separate bodies
of criticial writings (I said Stein's "criticism" or "theory" or
"poetics" didn't feel "separate" to me--that _How to Write_ felt not much
different in style, approach & intention to (say) _A Novel of Thank
You_), and was hoping POETICS list readers might pick up on the fact that
these writers were women. Implication being (generally) that "poetics
talk" or "theory" *tends* to be a male preoccupation. Of course that's a
wild generalization to make--there are exceptions. Also, I didn't mean to
imply that language poetry was wildly successful in academe, but that
relative to Stein, Loy & Barnes (& let's add Bernadette Mayer--another
influence on language and other contemporary writers), well, relative to
writers like Bernstein, Andrews, Silliman, Scalapino, Perelman & so on,
the earlier 20th century women experimental or exploratory or whathaveyou
writers weren't acknowledged by people in universities as quickly as the
language poets have been. (Not by *all* people in universities, or *all*
universities, mind you.) I suppose you could say that Stein's Yale series
was a form of academic "acknowledgment"--but, I'd argue that she *paid*
for those books to be published (the money for them left via her will),
and that, of course, Yale never bothered to reprint any of them after
they went out of print. (Except for a _Selected_.)

Of course, the _Times_ article on "The Poetry Pantheon" was ridiculous,
but do note that the only "exploratory" group of poets mentioned there
was the language poets--as though all of us writing non-mainstream poetry
were "language poets." I was amazed, reading a fairly recent essay by
Jefferson Hansen that appeared in _Poetic Briefs_--& Jeff's a really
talented poet & not unbrilliant guy--I was amazed that he could imply
that younger poets (like myself & hundreds--thousands?--of others) were
all "influenced" or, in his words, "were greatly indebted to" the
language poets. This is absurd, of course, and suggests that what might
have happened or be in the process of happening is that people are
tending to lump all "exploratory" poets into a single camp: language
poetry. My own influences are mostly artists, writers & thinkers who did
their work prior to 1970.

At any rate, I'd love to hear what others, men or women on this list,
have to say about "theory" or "poetics"--especially what the women have
to say: *Is* theory, *is* this notion that "Great poets have & make
public their insights into other 'great' poets" a particularly *male*
preoccupation? (Alan, if you don't know what that quote refers to, if you
lost Bernstein's original post, e-mail me separately & I'll pass along
the original post, which was a selection from a new book Sun & Moon has
just published.)

Yours,

Gary.

Dear David:

I don't remember offhand who said that, but if memory serves me, it was
re-quoted by Eliot Weinberger in one of his two essay books (_Outsider
Stories_ or _Works on Paper_). I don't have either of those books anymore
so I can't look them up for you, but I'm pretty sure you'll find it--and
I think Weinberger did cite the original--in one of them.

Good luck. Yours--Gary.

without 'taking sides,' i'd like to express my enthusiasm for nada's assertion
that it would be a "waste of a medium" for women to let "the men go for it"...

there are all sorts of gender issues at stake in a space such as this... it's
not simply how many women post/lurk vs. how many men (though this is in fact
*does* constitute, for me, a sort of bottom-line litmus of gender), there's
also the question raised by alan golding as to the parallel boy talk/theory
threads (for example)... part of the way to see these threads as connected
IS simply not to treat them as separate (!)... i mean, why is the boy talk
thread by its very nature NOT theoretical?... i would have to argue that it
is in fact a theorized discussion---though it's theory in a different vein,
hence it's perceived (by some) as atheoretical... i had in mind two items
in reading alan's post:  rachel blau duplessis' essay "for the etruscans"
(a poetic inquiry into "feminist aesthetic") and what i've heard from certain
communities of women (virtual and otherwise) re "theory"---that it's all too
often practiced in ways that exclude alternative voices/soundings...

a few typos in that paragraph above, i hate line editors...

anyway... there's something about that suggestion (who made it?) about shutting
up and letting the women speak that appeals to me, albeit i understand this
as a provisional gesture... we have to learn to dance with one another...

and believe me, this medium filters out *my* more active (male, i guess)
presence (ftf, that is), so i'm not pretending in any way to have developed
an immunity to what i'm busy t/hereabouts criteeking...

so i'll shut up now...

Dear Marjorie:

Too busy doing other things? You mean, like _Radical Artifice_? Marjorie,
that's disingenuous of you to say you're above "boy talk," considering
you make your living writing about poetry & poetics & theory--what we're
equating (or what some of us are equating here) with "boy talk."

Maybe what you mean is that you're above writing about theory *here*,
where you're not getting paid to do it? Are your classes at wherever you
teach totally unlike the discussions here on the net?

I think you've more to offer this discussion than pooh-poohing it
wholesale, & hope you'll maybe consider posting more.

Yours,

Gary

intended my remark to do. I'd like to respond much more to this idea,
particularly on Said's figure of the intellectual which he models
in a very weird way on Auerbach and many of the German philologists,
but I just don't have time. I love this list, and as Nada indicated,
it provides a complete unknown like me, someone out of the blue,
unconnected to any of the power centers, a forum and a  voice.
Unfortunately, I never have the time to take full advantage of it.

Cass (I hope that's right and not "B.Cass?"): I'd like to respond to
your message personally and sort of "out" myself in the process. I want
to do this because I'd like very very very much to believe in what you
say; that poetry makes a difference; that it can save the world; that's
why, I think, most of us are here, huh? But I'm troubled by the resistence
to the various discources (let's not pin it down to post-structuralism,
poetics, philosophies, etc: theory is what is used) that come, today,
under the category of "theory."
     When I graduated from high school, barely I might add, I knew I was
interested in writing poetry. Knew that's how I wanted to spend my life.
Didn't know where to, though, because where I grew up the only book store
in town was a used paper back place that sold mostly horror and romances.
So, like many of my friends, I went to the local community college, where
a teacher became interested and encouraged me to keep writing, and indeed
to go into a "writing program."
     So I shuffled off to a CSU in the San Fernando Valley, the only
place I could get into with a 1.9 hi school average, and became very
interested in the scene down there, Beyond Baroque, the BEBOP, etc.
My profossers of writing encouraged me to read langpo, and ny school
etc, because of course this was a hip school after all, if it couldn't
quite be a prestigious one. The point is that they were very receptive.
     (If this is boring you can skip to the last paragraph; I'm
currently involved in the very Foucault-esque thrill of confessing and
realize this is more of a kick for me than you) Ultimately, I went to
a graduate writing program here at LSU. I studied with Codrescu, and
Rodger (hey Rodger) and Dave Smith. Odd grouping, I know and in fact, for
me, this was very disconcerting because I kept getting mixed ideas as
to what poetry was. I became very confused as each tried to shape my
work. I began writing a kind of workshop poetry (as Golding terms it and
it is a very good term), though I tried to reconfigure it, subvert it
as I discovered the fiction of Acker and to a certain extent Auster. But
I was never quite satisfied.
     I graduated and stayed for a Ph.D. I discovered theory, particularly
the to me thrilling and disparate writings in Western Marxism. Then I
discovered post/neo colonial stuff, and I began re-reading my poetry
and the poetry I was reading and I realized how naive I was;they were.
How much they left out because they weren't keeping up with the explosion
of extremely various writings out there all called theory. I re-read
Frank O'Hara, found him to be fabulous in ways I never saw before. The
l-school I saw as being the most sophisticated thinkers in poetry I knew.
I re-read Audre Lorde, Sonia Sanchez, found them tapped into culture
more intimately then any of the mainstream political poets. Ultimately,
I signed on to this list and I realized (suck up) that I could talk
about these things for the first time with other poets, which I
couldn't do before (except with Rodger, obviously). Realized that there
were differences there, but they were aware, into it, not still talking
about line breaks, point of view, etc.
     And that's where I am now. Stuck selling a book I wrote when I was
a little more naive, though the things I was writing about I still think
was very important to me but the way I was writing seems naive, dated.
And better working, still working, on a method that ties in everything
I've learned then, and now.
    The point is that if you are not aware that as you write to certain
extent you are theorzing, you end up theorizing badly, which is what I was
doing. You end up seeming naive, lost, confused. I know, Cass, that you
and all the others on this list perhaps cannot identify too much with my
story because you already knew the "avant-garde" was the most interesting
and legitimate tradition, the only international one, as I believe Tom
said. But I didn't. Didn't even understand it. Until I began to theorize.
     Hope this didn't just bore the hell out of you, but I believed your
post required the most fully "historicized" response I could muster.
     Thanks, Eric.

Dear Marjorie:

I'll see if I can tempt you into writing to everyone/anyone again.

On your first point: I'm not sure that the gendered differences in
participation on the list occur because the women have more to do than the
men.(I do wonder, like you, where some folks find the time, as I find even
skimming the list tremendously time-consuming). We can probably agree that
even in working-couple-with-family households like Gabrielle described, in
arrangements where there's a conscious, sustained effort to make things
equitable, women often end up being stuck with more of the load. But I'm not
sure that the quantitative difference between male and female work
loads/responsibilities is large enough to explain the participation
differences we've been talking about. At least, it's not among my peers and in
the community in which I live. In other words, I don't think this notion that
women simply have tons more to do than men will really wash, will it?

And is this mode of communication somehow unsatisfactory to women? I've been
wondering about that myself; we've had posts suggesting how it might be, and
Kali especially, though others have too, has talked about how it might be. But
I much prefer to write to someone, too. (I think this is probably the first
public e-mail letter you and I have written to each other.) On the whole this
preference may be gendered, but I do think there are other issues beyond that.

What are they? Wish I had time to figure that out.

Alan

Cass,

Yeah, friends have been pinging me the bandwidth in question for a
while now.  I find some of it funny and some stoopid, or both at once.

Condolences?  Soldarity?  Maybe those are appropriate, but don't
direct them to "me," it's my "name" and "identity" that have been
usurped, and I've already lost title to 'em.  There was a guy last
year on the Derrida list, for instance, who copied messages, including
mine, and posted them on other lists.  Or something--I never got it
straight, and found the whole business bemusing.

Not to say I don't care.  I do!  But I realize now I haven't any idea
what it means to be a writer--to share my words when all I have to
offer ARE words, with only a name to guarantee my propietary interest,
and only a social mechanism (often bewildering, if not oppressive) to
guarantee reception.  Until I get THAT straight, I think I'll stick
to being a grad student, which I find much easier.

E-mail is an extreme instance, for sure, but it HAS made explicit how
in public discourse, at the most extreme edges, where all we have are
words, dialogue in the ethical sense is impossible.  There is no
"face to face," only an economic relation, free and not-so-free exchange
of thoughts, feelings, bodily fluids (from the body without organs),
echoes, ventriloquism, plays within plays.

"Ben Friedlander" may be my "personal_name," but I could just as well
type "Benji," "worm," even "B. Cass Clarke."  And obviously, ANYONE
could type those names.  Identity, especially on the 'net, is just
another subject line, easily appropriated, misused, a cover for
something snuck in illegitimately, sometimes out of sloppiness or
ignorance, sometimes in bad faith.  The only limits set for this
appropriation are structural (a hacker's power far supercedes a
parodist's) and legal (cf. the alt.sex.stories pornographer who got
arrested for using a classmate's name).

And then again, while these issues all pertain in the so-called real
world, e-mail is different.  I have no idea what the "real" ramifications
of that difference are, but being (like you) a Dickhead (as in Philip K.)
I assume they're bad.

I would probably be more upset if my name or identity had been used more
maliciously--that has to be said too.

But thanks for passing the junk along,

Yours "in the analogy,"
Ben

Subj:   legislators

Dear Cris and Eric

        Thank you both for your backchannel and public response.

        You remember the line from Shelley - poets are the unacknowledged
legislators - on that level poets have been warring with commerce, as
well as philosophers, critics, historians etc., since an attempt at
a definition of poetry's value, use and purpose came up for defense.

        I said "post-romantic" because it is within that tradition that
this "defense" occurs, from medieval forward - i.e. a *belief* that the
poet performs a job that cannot be relegated to the other arts.  This
includes the long tradition of invisibilities, knowledges that are not
contained by philos., mathematics, etc.

        That post romanticism is not recognized as valid has to do with
the trend of treating any practise which includes some notion of power
not material, as disreputable and exposed by the advent of deconstruction.
For the act of poeisis depends upon a maker, an author.  These days to
be a singular identity is to be phallocentric, anti-multicultural, etc.

        Unfortunately the prime requirement of making is thrown out because
of its patriarchal associations.  We have not yet seen how poetry will
recover, but there are many workers out there who are bleeding tears
trying. Including so-called language poets.

        The "correct line" is not the one I'm drawing.  But here in
Buffalo, there are many strings being pulled.  Most of the posters to
this list are naturally caught up in the politics of the situation and
it is national.  They want jobs. Academic jobs.  Here, if you're not
with the lang-po project, it's not happening.  Witness major poet hirings
nationally and you get language critics, language poets.  They control
who gets brought in, who gets read, who gets studied - i.e. the remaking
of the  *canon*.  So the fight, if there is one has to do with who will
rewrite history?  Those poets who have academic jobs from the prior wave,
Creeley, Dorn, Blaser, - I'm speaking of the Black Mt. here, for example,
we can insert our favorites here, have understandably left the arena to the youn
and will be replaced by the next *hot* language poet.  I can think of
others who were never part of the academic, Kyger, DiPrima, Grenier, Thorpe,
Sanders, yes I have my favorites too, and many whose work I don't know,
as I'm sure you can, who continue to teach and labor without the same
 visibility afforded a tenured professor with good small press (or large)
commitments.

        It will always be this way, it ever has been.  I fall on the side
of Mental War is Combat for the Angel, conducted by individuals armed
with theory, philosophy, history, criticism, hell why not some architech-
tonic too?  This chick is old-fashioned that way, and no puritan mean
streak will put me on the sidelines with the wallflowers.

        As to the legislators, someone must take the initiative. As to
this list, it was Bernstein, I believe, who took the initiative and has,
as far as I can tell, been courageous in his efforts to keep the lines
open, and encourage all comers.  His kind of equanimity is becoming
rare in this time of fear.

        With regard,

        Cass

Well, OK, to respond to Alan and Gary:

I'm not satisfied with such a simplistic gender explanation either, so
let me just speak for myself.
Gary says it's disigenuous of me to say I don't have time when I do have
time to write books.  To which one could say: well, yes, but if I spent
much time on the e-net, I wouldn't.  But more seriously: writing articles/
books is one thing: you work, you revise, you research and you don't
let anything out of the house that you haven't thought through.  Conversation
with students is a second thing--and I adore it--and that's face to face and
really fun.
But for me too much of what comes through this poetics group is just
throw-away, personal little bits and it doesn't quite seem like a "conver-
sation."  I suppose it does when I know the person as I know Alan who
is a good friend but not when it's someone I don't know.
So:  this is just a gut reaction to (1) having been excited when this net
began and loving to read the messages, and (2) now feeling every day a
sense of oh-my-god here are 25 messages on the Poetics net to plow through
and 90% is just not interesting to me.  I'm not saying it's anyone's fault,
but perhaps there would be a better way to organize it so that private
conversations between A and B wouldn't just bounce back and forth and be
left unresolved.

Regarding Adorno, as Eric Pape says, as a pessimist not a cynic, not
giving up the "ever more problematic possibility of Utopia."

Can't one be a non-cynic, in fact can't one even be an optimist (but my
that is harder every day) without believing in Utopia. Even Thomas More
had his problems with Utopia, creating one which was patently unlivable,
and putting its articulation in the utterings of Raphael Hythloday, a

Dear Cass:

I was thinking about your recent post, and about Jack this a.m.
as I made the bed. About "the human", partly because I have to teach
Foucault and Derrida tonight to a group of undergraduates, partly
because I was trying to come up with a name for what Jack so
generously offered those lucky enough to work with him. And, for me
anyway, "human" is it. This, I guess, is one of those key sites where
I find myself at odds with those Euro-guys. I mean the notion that the
human is over. When, from an "Ohio" point of view (I guess you could
read "Emerson" here), the problem is we have yet to realize the human,
except in very rare cases.

Best,
Mike

UC San Diego, San Francisco State, Brown, Sonoma, Simon Frazer, Albany

programs.  That's about 30 LPs versus ____ .  Can anyone fill in the
blank?

Well, there are slightly over 260 programs in the US (plus whatever more
in Canada, which has a population somewhere between California and
Texas), and I might be inclined to add Penn, UC Santa Cruz, Wayne State,
University of Alabama and a few other schools, but really what
constitutes "infiltration"? I think that virtually ALL of the New
American Poetry branches, not just langpo, acquire a significant amount
of their weight and moral authority precisely by virtue of their being a
literature of the urban writing scenes rather than of the campus. And of
the 40 poets in In the American Tree, only 5 or 6 (depending on whether
Fanny Howe has tenure at UCSD, which I'm not clear on) have ever had
tenure. Of those, one is retired (Bromige) and another (Andrews) has
tenure in political science.

I wonder how Paul Hoover feels at (1) being asked to stand as the incon
for langpo in the NY Times and (2) being described there basically as an
unintelligible man w/ tenure, which his school (Columbia College in
Chicago) does not even offer?? or Leslie (a lurker here, I believe)
likewise, who has been so clear for so many years that her relationship
to the basic langpo traits has been that of friendly critic and whose
summer job at Bard similarly cannot count as that major tenured job
alluded to?

The value of the NY Times piece seems to me to come precisely from its
wrong-headedness. I.e., the NY Times is willing to put forward an index
of how out of it the journal really is.

One further thought: Larry Bensky on KPFA the other morning (talking up
the series on the first 100 days of the republican administration that
he's doing w/ Juliane Malveaux on the Pacifica Radio Network) virtually
mapped to the Apex of the M argument in saying that, to paraphrase,
"Newt Gingrich's band of republicans are like Language Poets. They talk
about government out of context and in that denatured light, everyone
can imagine it as Other, as alien, rather than as the collective
expression of the will of the people."

Sigh.

Shiva,

You make a good point about (not) generalizing about ALL women.  Another
implicit assumption seems to be that when one says man or woman on this list,
one means hetero man & woman.  I don't want to generalize, but I do want to
speak.

And we seem to be talking here; this list seems more speechlike than any
other discourse I'm familiar with, a cocktail party as nada said.  And speech
is the wonderful land of generalizations, big ideas expressed in a few words.


How should we speak about gender and biology?   Binary is right out.  How
many genders are there?

Rather than post multiple messages...

Cass, thank you for that last post. You know John Thorpe's work? I grew
up in California, lived in the Bay Area 10 years, not once did I hear
Thorpe's name mentioned, read anything anyone had to say about him. I
move out here to Minneapolis-St. Paul, no longer have a scene to rely on
to suggest "what to read"--voila! I discover Thorpe's books in used
bookstores. _Exogeny_, _The Cargo Cult_, _Five Aces & Independence_, then
Spencer Selby graciously gives me his copy of _Matter_. He's become one
of my favorite living poets (I assume he's still alive), have learned
much from his work. No one writes about him these days, maybe never wrote
about him. He didn't make it easy for the critics. No cliff note
manifestos, not even anything (so far as I know) about other poets, never
wrote a book review, even. The fact that he was (again, so far as I know)
unaffiliated didn't help, I'm sure.

Other interesting discoveries made only after I moved out of the bay
area: Well, the second most important for me was Philip Whalen. I
discover, lately, that Scalapino at least wrote about the guy, a short
treatment of his work that wound up in her Potes & Poets book of
criticism. Thanks, Leslie. I literally never heard his name mentioned,
nor did I see any of his work, until I moved out here.

"New Hope for the Disappeared" Ron? Nice that you'd write about Ceravolo
when you did, I thought your piece on his work in _The New Sentence_ was
swell. But, what's the common thread among these poets who's work we have
to *hunt* for? They didn't go public with their manifestos, theoretical
insights, etc. Thorpe is obviously a brilliant thinker: you couldn't
write _Five Aces_ "off the cuff"; obviously a *lot* of thought & planning
went into that book. Why haven't we any critics willing to write about
it? Is it simply easier to take a poet who *has* said a few public words
about his/her writing and write about him/her?

That, Marjorie, was the feeling I got, reading your _Radical Artifice_. I
thought the book was good, but was surprised that, in a book that had, as
subtitle, "Poetry Writing in the Age of Media" that you not once
mentioned Bern Porter, who I imagine was, if not the first, certainly one
of the first American poets to use & address--not exclusively, but
close--the media in his work. My suspicion was that you'd never heard of
Porter--quite likely as most of his books were self-published. (As
opposed to paying, say, Station Hill to publish 'em.) No distribution,
save Bookslinger (found a mountain of his books there). SPD doesn't carry
'em. What you say in your last post about wanting or enoying only
carrying on discussions with people you know suggests the possible reason
so much of _Radical Artifice_ seemed to be about Sun & Moon authors-you
are, after all, on their Advisory Board. It seems to me, if you're
talking to the same people all the time to the exclusion of people you
don't know, you'll perhaps bring a very limited body of work to your
critical writing. If I'd not've moved out of the bay area, would I ever
have discovered John Thorpe? I'm admittedly a very impressionable person
and moving out here was great for me as it forced me to do my own hunting
around for poetry, etc.

Charles, thanks for the footnote re: Raphael Hythloday. More's wonderful.
I'm sorry I missed Lazer's lecture & reading, and the lunch at your
house. I've been sick with the flu, only starting to recouperate. I hope
it all went well.

Maybe it's just because I'm new to this, but I really appreciate getting
loads of e-mail, especially when they include names of poets I've not
heard of before, or composers, & addresses as to where one might find
this stuff. Thanks to Mark Nowak for much of that. I also *enjoy* some of
the more "personal" posts--thank both Kali and Sheila E. for theirs,
especially, as well as Cass's. I think it's great that the language poets
have been receiving whatever recognition they've received, but I do think
that, undoubtedly unintentionally, a lot of other work's being lost or
forgotten in the process. As lineages are mapped out & recognized (you
all realize the Loft, here in MPLS-STPL, is a terribly conservative
writing institution, but that when it did make a single nod to
"exploratory" poetries decided to do a class on language writing, as
though that's "all she wrote") unaffiliateds & those who never made
public the ideas & concerns that went into the "creative" work *except*
in the creative work, are being forgotten, erased.  I'll leave you all
with something from Mina Loy. It's somewhat self-righteous, but
appropriate enough:

SHOW ME A SAINT WHO SUFFERED

Show me a saint who suffered in humility;
I will show you one and again another
who suffered more and in deeper humility
than he.

I who have lived among many of the unfortunate
claim that of the martyr to have been
a satisfactory career, his agony
being well-advertised.

Is not the sacrifice of security to renown
conventional for the heroic?
The common tragedy is to have suffered
without having "appeared."


PS: Ron, I guess it was a drag not to've been mentioned in Dinitia
Smith's _Times_ article under the grouping of language poets (none of
whom were, of course, language poets). Now you know how I felt when I
picked up a copy of your _N/O_ and saw that you'd forgotten to
acknowledge _Stifled Yawn_ as one of the magazines who'd published some
of that work (the first 4 pages of "NON" as you'll recall). Sigh, indeed.

I noticed that the House committee on appropriations voted to cut CPB and
NPR by 15 percent this year, 30 next, much smaller cuts than they
anticipated from this particularly hostile committee. I'd expect to see
the same for the Endowments. A hopeful sign.

On the less hopeful side, I quote from a discussion of "The English
Poetry Full-Text Database," a 4-CD set that includes, says the author,
the complete life works of roughly 1,250 poets. Of this, says the author,

"But who are they all? How many poets could you list off the cuff? I sat
down for half an hour, scratched my brain [nice mixed metaphor
there--RS], and got as far as a lousy fifty-five."

This from page 102 of the Feb 20/27 double issue of the New Yorker, by
Anthony Lane. Maybe he studied with Dinitia Smith.

Obviously, in NYC's "mainstream" media when it comes to the
knowledge-base for reporting on the topic of verse, less is more.

It does make for tidier narratives. Which may be how Mark Strand made 4
separate lists in the Times, including "best-looking males."

Subject:      More in re: Radical Artifice

Marjorie:

Other missing material from _Radical Artifice_:

Daniel Davidson's book _Product_, published by e.g. press in 1991. Anyone
who has read both your _RA_ and _Product_ can tell you why it should've
been included. A full-frontal assault on advertising/P.R., the most
successful I've ever read, which is why my wife & I published it.
Probably you never heard about the book because, when my wife (Marta
Deike) and I took over the press in 1989, it was something of the
laughingstock of the west coast language writing scene, though its
original editor, David Highsmith had published a book of David Bromige's
and Todd Baron's. He also published (the unmittegated gall!) a lot of
people who weren't in that particular scene.

e.g. was so thoroughly detested by language writers that Todd Baron took
the manuscript he'd had published through e.g. (_Partials_) and got O
Books to publish it--without acknowledging that e.g. had been the
original publisher. I assume the fact that the people in your general
circle think so poorly of the press is why none of them bothered to tell
you about Dan's book--even despite the fact that Dan is very much a
"language" writer (see his work in Ganick's anthology). I'll send a copy
of __Product_ if you like; just let me know.

Also missing, of course, is the work David Ossman's done: especially his
_How Time Flies_. As pointed as anything in _The Baffler_ re: the
entertainment industry, and recorded in 1973.  Why you chose to write
about Lyn Hejinian's _My Life_ in the context of "Writing Poetry in the
Age of Media" to the neglect of these other things is precisely what has
me questioning your motivation, as well as your sources for information.

Someone just mentioned that Charles Bernstein's to be thanked for setting
this list up, and for keeping it open to any & all, including
loudmouthed, opinionated malcontents like myself (& a few others). Yes.
Lovely thing this; one can question people, challenge them, and have it
somewhat public, "on record." Much better than a magazine, as, you write
something negative about language poetry for, say, Rod Smith's magazine,
it gets rejected. (I'm referring to Alan Davies' uneven, but certainly
provocative, "Peer Pleasure," which has been passed around among poets
since having been rejected by _Aerial_.)

Charles? When I first read the piece you wrote for Bernadette Mayer's
_Utopia_, I thought you disingenuous, given the sometimes exclusionary
tactics of (at least) the west coast language poets & affiliateds. You of
course know, and probably better than I do, how Johanna Drucker was
treated by 'em. At any rate, I no longer think that; am really glad
you've made this space available. This is truly "reader response."

Finally.

Marjorie and Kali and B. Cass and other women speaking up on this subject
may have more in common with Alan Golding, Tom Mandel, and other men than
they do with each other on any of a variety of subjects. Being a woman
does not insure agreement anymore than men agree. The women's movement
sought agreement or at least support along gender lines, but doesn't even
within this narrow group appear to hold when personal identity and
aesthitic issues are raised. Poets dont agree, men don't agree, women
don't agree and neither does anyone else. We are all tender in parts and
I hope will persevere even if we don't agree.

that of voicing, reading out loud  -  which seems crucial to this

issues of composition and to oral - improvisatory traditions and innovative
oral - improvisatory 'practice' (surely it's always practice, however

reception, -- but like John Geraets was saying, deaf people may well

old surrealist depths, and disallowing the constructed "language"

attached in the 70's and 80's (or so it seemed to me, and as I
thought usefully).

Marjorie and others in this loop:
I have had several conversations recently regarding control on the
listserv. On the one hand we don't want to tell anyone what to say;
clearly censorship is not a good idea. On the other hand there are a lot
of personal discussions made public and "exhibitionists" contrast with
"lurkers" vying for the same mental space.

Based on backchannel discussions with some other people I would make two
recommendations based on my own difficulties and others concurrence with
these difficulties, not the least of which is Marjorie's complaint.
Perhaps these will form the basis of discussion.

1. Perhaps Loss can subdivide the list into two parts. Part one can be
for listings of events, newsletters, and exchanges of bibliographical
information. Part two can be a discussion list where people can express
their individual views collectively.
2. Without making any rules, perhaps people could keep personal notes and
conspiritorial exchanges to the back channel. I don't want to point any
fingers here, but there are a lot of short notes thatdon't really add to
the discussion and are also directed at only one other person. That
constitutes back channel material to me. This would solve what many of us
feel are messages which "clog up" our bulletin board. Obviously personal
exchanges can be used to "inform" the group. This trope which is
developing nicely is an effective, but not particularly attractive
technique. That's the kind of thing we might consider doing without, but
it has to be applied by each individual and might be considered
acceptable under conditions which each individual anywhere on the
spectrum from "lurker" to "exhibitor" has to judge for themselves.

These two changes might make it easier to go through the list and to find
what we each want to look at without having to wade through 40 or more
messages over a weekend. I'd appreciate discussion on these matters.

Hi Marjorie, it's just yet another rejoinder to your post about post.
Suffice to say, and many would testify, I have down several years been the
most non-existent correspondent almost anybody could have wished for. My
letters barely ever crossed a mat. BUT

I like e-mail and am pretty active with it. I find when I sit down to write
letters I feel that I'm engaging in an old-school type 'proper' 'literary'
activity. The sort of thing that might one day be published by some trust.
I value the transitory aspect of this. Don't you find that conversation is
full of 'throw-away, personal little bits'? One minute you're humming with
excitement of discovery through detailed exchange - the next boiling a
kettle for a cup of tea (sorry that's very Anglo-centric of me I know)? But
the drift is clear.
E-mail feels more like post cards might have done to me, if I'd ever posted
the ones that I bought. Letters always felt like serious writing whereas I
find this space as Tom Mandel described it to be 'a pleasant whirlwind' in
which a variety of agendas appear to circle and sample each other with some
variety of speeds of address and attention. The cafe, the bar, the club,
the coffee break at the conference, the chance encounter between the
supermarket shelves, the heated discussion in the corner shop, the after
hours philosophising and more all seems to breand here. I'm curious - it's
seems full of new potential. It feels like a localised conversation of
distances. I'm trying to keep myself open to change through the process.
And I'm probably giving it as much time as I should have given to writing
letters in the past. But I get a lot more post and get to meet people I
might never otherwise have known. What's the problem?

feel it needs devaluing because  . . . ?

Hi Tony, yes I realise I'm treading a fine line when it comes to the dances
of tongues in a mouth.
I'm all for the 'oral emission' of extremely un-speech-like constructed
language and the speech-like things (Burroughs is one of the great
vaudeville vocal performers). I'd love to hear P. Inman read. Tom Raworth
is the most energising and compelling reader here on this port off the
pond. Many of the lang'shan-po are strong readers. I'd bring other aural
imaginative strategies such as Jackson MacLow and Hannah Weiner and very
very much enjoy what Carla Harryman and Steve Benson have done and are
doing in terms of memory and improvisation in performance. I'd bring
Michael Smith with his dub song-poem 'My cyaan believe it', Jean Binta
Breeze, Linton Kwesi Johnson  - many many more across into the music more
direct Tribe Called Quest 'When the Papes Come'. I'd bring Schwitters' 'Ur
Sonata' and Ernst Jandl and Chopin and Cobbing and the 4 Horsemen of the
Apocalypse and many others  - Jerry Rothenberg performing Frank Mitchell's
'Horse Songs'. All of these people (it's only a tip off a scratch) work
with aural / oral invention and imagination. All of this work is
constructed - 'language under pressure'.
As to 'the old surrealist depths' I remember jotting down a quote of
Margaret Thatcher's "I will delve deeply into the surface of things" -
seems to take care of that. She should have recorded 'Feelings' it would
have been sincere.

Any thoughts ?

Subject:      Re: Boy Talk

Delurking /Delousing/Coming Clean

Having only joined the poetics list a short time ago, I have followed the
gender trouble (let's get out of the old binaries of boys vs girls at
least) discussion with great interest.  It seems that the concurrent
discussion on the relationship between theory and practice would be more
interesting if it passed beyond rather than below the abstract limbo
stick to speak in terms of greater specificity-which aspects of practice
have been institutionalized, which aspects are still excluded from the
academies, can this be linked to trends in pedagogic practice such as the
teaching of certain theories over others or how they are taught in
relation to poetry.  I have appreciated the comments of Kali Tal (hello
Kali!) as well as all the other women who have contextualized gender problems on
poetics list from their own perspective.

At this point, I would like to "delurk" and try to articulate my own
politics of location.  I am a Melbournian doctoral student (with no
affiliation with A=R=I=T=M=E=T=R=I=C=K and who has eaten lanolin-free
Hokey Pokey icecream and lived to tell the tale) who is researching ways in
which contemporary poetry contributes to feminist cultural practice.  I
also teach a course on postmodernism which has such items as the Hoover
anthology and Laurie Anderson on its syllabus.  I am interested in the
challenge that the internet offers both in terms of poetic community
formation and discursive horizons.

It is not surprising that the net creates its own disciplinization and
exclusion effects; rather we should be asking how these can be changed.
Although statistics are the fool's creditcard, my information was that
women make up only 5% of the population who use the net.  So the poetics
list is obviously attracting women to enter its space.  The question then
arises as to which women and how they engage with the net both as a
medium and as a practice. Being Australian, I am speaking on the margins
as a not-so-dutiful daughter to the many on the list who are or have been
associated with Language poetry in one way or another. Yet, as part of
the university, access to the list was easier for me than it is for many
Australian women who are interested in contemporary poetry and poetics
but who feel isolated.  The net is one way in which such isolation can be
dissolved.

From my Asian-Pacific position, I cannot contribute to matters
of US funding and I feel that much of what is discussed on the poetics
list has a localized politics of which I am uninformed.  However, I feel
that such a connection is invaluable-whether taken up in more active ways
or not(my lurking is not necessarily passive and can be tactical).  I am
therefore content to "listen in on" than query much of what goes on in
the list. That's all I'll say for now if not just for another voice and
two cents in the debate.

Thanks,

Ann Vickery

P.S.  Given that most ocker slang derives from a cockney origin, perhaps
it is fitting that our convict past has furnished us with the world's

Subject:      community request

I'm grateful to Ron Silliman for propelling me to this list back in
December.  I've lurked, feeling peripheral, but have a request I'd like
your help with.

One story about the value of poetry says that its meaning is like the
meaning of money:  not an intrinsic value, only a value of exchange.  The
greater the community-building involved, the more valuable the poetry
which is the basis of that exchange.  I learned this idea in fact from
Ron, though my formulation is not his, I don't think.

I'd like to consider this idea, now, more seriously, and am hoping that
some of you will have suggestions for me of things to read, problems to
grapple with, other issues.

The context for my question is that I'm interested in doing a
nearly-sociological study of how poetry is actually used (in the specimen
case of the Washington DC area, though I'd hope with relevance to other
physical communities).  There's an anxiety I suppose everybody writing
poetry has grappled with, about the value to others of the enterprise,
and it seems to me that if there were some new ways of talking about the
varied applications and, I guess you could say, "community-significances"
of the poems themselves it might be useful.

So I'm pretty shamelessly asking for help, asking to pick your brains on
this.

Since so few of you know me at all either in person or by name, I should
say by way of intro that, having done a PhD dissertation (1975) on
Oppen's poetry, I am teaching, and have been since 1974, at George
Washington University in DC.

A postscript:  I've broken silence finally because the gender issues being
raised, as well as the issues of time and focus raised by Marjorie Perloff
and others, seem to focus on the status of this list too as a community,
and I thought perhaps you might all be already really thinking of this
subject.

Thanks -- David McAleavey

Sometimes you just go through deleting everything that isn't
by someone whom you feel you must read in each address, and
that's just the way it is. It is not necessary to digest
completely what's on a listserv to get something out of it
and to find it possible to give something to it. Other times,
less often to be sure, one reads each post carefully - that's
the way you want to spend your time that time.

I don't think there's anything to do, either, about people
getting excited and dashing off fuzzy paragraphs to each
other. My sense is that imposing an order of division or
of personal discipline will not change anything.

It is true that the number of posts is daunting, especially
if god forbid you take off 3-4 days. I do wish, but there's
nothing to do to make it so, that people would think thru
what they are about to say; if it really doesn't amount
to much, it's always possible to wait for another day.

I agree with James about dividing the list into two categories, and it would
appear that category #2 (discussions of issues) will simply require the sort
of judgment which several people are urging that people use in the present

Everyone who has commented on this list about the NY Times Magazine
article on poetry by Dinitia Smith has laughed at or otherwise critized
the treatment of language poetry, and the choices used to represent it. I
agree entirely, but I must admit that the article made me consider that
its treatment of other issues in poetry, such as cronyism, awards to
friends, control by Academy of American Poets, etc., a treatment with
which I might find myself in agreement, must have been equally
ridiculous. I don't know if I applaud Stephen for "turning off the lite"
and not reading it, or if I think there was a curious delight in reading
something so totally ludicrous.

As to James Sherry's suggestion about dividing into two lists, I'm not so
sure. I have responded and become involved in conversations where posts
seemed private. I also would wonder about decisions as to an "a" and a
"b" list. I greatly value the growing divergence of views, particularly
as represented in "boy talk" posts and in Gary Sullivan's energetic,
thoughtful, and informative posts, some of which are directed personally
at Marjorie or Charles or Mark or me or others (Thanks, Gary, for
information on John Thorpe, whose work I don't know, and for making my
picture of "e.g." more clear). I have found value in many of your posts,
James, which were ostensibly responses to specific individuals and
addressed to them as such. I liked the characterization of
this floating conversation nexus as Cris Cheek put it --
"I find this space as Tom Mandel described it to be 'a pleasant whirlwind' in
which a variety of agendas appear to circle and sample each other with some
variety of speeds of address and attention. The cafe, the bar, the club,
the coffee break at the conference, the chance encounter between the
supermarket shelves, the heated discussion in the corner shop, the after
hours philosophising and more all seems to breand here. I'm curious - it's
seems full of new potential. It feels like a localised conversation of
distances."

Let's keep the whilrwind moving. If there was a division into two areas,
I could see a value in one part being posts of conferences, lists of
available books, and no conversation whatsoever, and the other being the
conversations, no matter how widely or narrowly directed, no matter how
central or tangential they seem to the list as a whole.

        all best,

That's no news about the giant tapeworm fopund in Buffalo; Benji has
been, to literary people, known for years. Chas Bernstein raised
benji since he was a pup, and a truer pet was never known. Charles
even brought Benji to a conference in Calgary 2 years ago, and it is
no easy thing to being a half-grown tapeworm across the canadian
border. The poets converged in Calgary took to Benji, and fed him; in
fact they vied for the opportunity to feed him. Benji is particularly
fond of Lacanian case histories.

In-Reply-To:  <199502221528.AA22274@mailhub.cc.columbia.edu>

Hello "everyone"--

I'm tuning in kind of late here on the boy-talk/theory thread, but in
response to Gary Sullivan's observation that Mina Loy, Gertrude Stein, and
Djuna Barnes didn't "provide separate bodies of critical writings,"  I
feel that I must point out that (depending of course on how we are
defining bodies here!) Mina Loy did. In the mid twenties she felt so
compelled to draw out the theoretical implications of Stein's aesthetic
that she pressed the word 'deconstruction' into circulation-- this was in
Ford's transatlantic.  And I think the entire notion of 'deconstruction'
(in the parisian, sixties ense of the word) was intelligible to her
because of the way her sense of sex politics shaped her aesthetic from
the beginning.

Gary Sullivan's observation interests me though because it leads me to
wonder-- what "counts" as theory?  If I can use Barnes' article about how
it feels to be forcibly fed (as she allowed herself to be, in sympathy
for the British suffragists) as a way of reading her work, then doesn't
it stand as theory? Maybe these writers theorized in ways that are still
invisible to too many of us. (That comment really is a general one, and
not directed against Gary Sullivan, who raised the question well)

I think it was Naomi Schor who figured out that Freud didn't believe
women could theorize.... that what we supposedly do instead is construct
paranoid observations based on the repressed or projected (but in any case,
apparently intellectually stifling) experience of our own bodies...Loy
was forced to write an epic in response to this sort of thing.

...Hello again,

It was unimaginative of me, I know, but I couldn't figure out how to
connect the Girl-talk/theory thread with Kenneth Koch... which leads to
the question I would like, in all seriousness, to ask: does he have
female readers?  I am very interested in the relative lack of discussion
about New York School poets (a few exceptions aside) at conferences, and
here too.  Tenney Nathanson brought up the lineage question (what did
they do that hasn't been picked up by language poets) and the *question
itself* wasn't even picked up.  I'm wondering if it's in part because of
the apparent sexual politics of, for instance, Koch's stories (and his
ART OF LOVE).  Or is it a generational blind spot?

KK is about to turn 70 (!), and a celebration reading/performance is
being planned for March 23, 7:00PM, in New York City.... yours truly is
curating the food.  Anyone interested in participating in some way, or
anyone wishing more information, can contact me at <jma5@columbia.edu>.

Meanwhile I continue to admire his recent two collections with a lot of
unanswered questions surfing the brain.

Has anyone else picked up Anne Porter's work, by the way?  I'm not sure
she would have wide appeal among members of the list, but I was surprised
and moved by her stuff, the way I was when I first found Schuyler.

that's all she wrote

categories. What's the proposal? How will it work? Who is going to decide
what is and what isn't an issue? It looks a very slippery slope to me!
Not having been able to read what must have been a serious discussion I'm
curious as to what the benefits can be. And isn't it true that sometimes
hot issues emerge from the pan-handling of what appears to be nothing more
than playful chit-chat? Jokes and deliberate (nay wilful) misunderstandings
can provide unexpected impetus for flight / engagement. But is this more an
instance of net flight -, establishing a compound safe from the rabble at
the gates?

I'm with Chris Cheek, and think "dividing" the list wd only "multiply"
the problem.

One firm suggestion: puh-lease send private notes privately. This alone
wd make the list easier to handle. Moreover, if a discussion turns out
to be between you and one or two other folks, send messages among
yourselves if you can bear not to place your message before this
public.

That was more than one suggestion. Here's a final one: consider
carefully whether the funny remark you are about entropize electrons
with is really likely to be so received among the several dozen other
puns on hokeypokey, etc. (I am sure I am as guilty as anyone, btw).

Restraint in these areas would lighten the load, clarify the focus
of the list, and make my life at least a little easier to manage
in this particular.

But, lets not divide a thing all the same.

The exraordinary intellectual stimulation of Talmudic study comes from
the need to try to develop logical or linear coherence out of the record
of an oral conversation -- topics in the Talmud move easily from
questions of Shabbat practice to the issue of whether or not giving the
infant oatmeal will make it stop crying....  (Of course, study of Talmud
is an oral practice of the study of an oral text, despite all that
emphasis about being "of the book"....).
Let's keep our richness on the poetics list and not divide it.

another list)... though your suggestion SOUNDS tidier, i doubt that it
will prevent public service announcements (if you will) from being posted

Subject:      Re: More in re: Radical Artifice

I do just want to respond a little to Gary Sullivan's remarks about
Marjorie Perloff's _Radical Artifice_, perhaps also in the context of
the girl/boy/tone discussion which, as an anti-rape activist, a consistent
grader of girls higher than boys in my classes, and a co-editor of a
British anthology of contemporary experimental women's poetry, I continue
to find Kali Tal wrongly putting me on the wrong "side" of.
        Let me say first off that I agree with Gary Sullivan that Daniel
Davidson's _Product_ is a wonderful, brilliant work, so as to assure him
that I am not hiding a partisan agenda underneath my comments. More on
_Product_ in a minute. I happen to also think that _Radical Artifice_ is
a wonderful, brilliant work too - please let me add that I do usually
use such terms of real esteem sparingly. I always read Marjorie Perloff's
writing wherever I can find it. Many of her books mark and back up a
critical moment, usually in sea-changes in literary academic trends, and
they do so in such a language that they succeed (in my experience) in
appealing to the kind of mindset and rhetoric of correctness that most
academics do have, and, having got their ear, pour a little of the present
into it. Put more simply, Marjorie Perloff has always seemed to me to be
the kind of rare and invaluable university teacher who actually keeps
*updating the syllabus*, putting new books on; and what I'm trying to say
about her critical prose style is that I think it is very effective in
appealing to very static unchanging teachers to also update their syllabus.
It's hard to say how, but I think it's because she awakens the sense
of seriousness that academics should have, and usually only have in their
inflated sense of themselves. She writes, in my opinion, given this audience,
with brilliant cajoling rhetoric.
        This is important work, and much more likely to succeed in getting
teachers to update their syllabus, than different kinds of rhetoric; for
example, huge sweeping generalisations against academia in general. I hope
that it might be appreciated as a subtlety that I applaud this in Marjorie
Perloff, even though I myself prefer vainglorious sweeping generalisations
against academia in general. I cannot but, after all, acknowledge the
reality; that her method works, and is professional, mine doesn't, and is
done out of selfish pleasure and despair. I hope Kalil might appreciate
that if I draw attention to myself by saying this, it is also to welcome
criticism.
        The book is called _Radical Artifice_. Might not this be seen as
also describing itself, without quite so much rancor? Like all books, it has
authors it wishes to discuss, one, and wants to inaugurate a whole new
area of study, two: in this case, poetry and media, poetry as media. Of
course there won't be a tidy fit, that's what Perloff argues for all the#
authors she discusses. Instead, it has an elegant surface, and, to quote a
phrase, throws down the gauntlet: go ahead and top this, with different
authors, different critical footholds, and rival me for prose style, why
don't you? I myself find this kind of confident stylishness really
exhilarating.
        If anything, _Radical Artifice_, taken as a part of a body of work,
moving from discussing Lowell and O'Hara, opening territory with Cage and
with futurism, shows a questing writer moving through and against the
dominat avant-garde of the sixties and seventies, and finally producing
her most assured and "this is my moment" work; or, as Cage found, switching
from being a strongly opinionated and ambitious student of the art seeking
out and talking to those she esteems, to becoming someone others will
esteem. In this, Perloff's journey, as I'm putting it, resembles and indeed
illuminates the Language Writers, who are after all critics as well as
poets, more as one of them than anything else. For me anyway, reading all
of Perloff's much more readily available books helped me to find a way
into Language Writing, both its "forms" and, more importantly, the culture,
the history of opposition, its writers come from.
        So that it seems to me to be too harsh and mudthrowing to attack
her work in this way. Yes, there is a Sun & Moon connection, but as I am
suggesting that would be more understandable if Perloff was seen as a kinf
kind of poet-critic. Donald Davie, in England, does just the same, and
is attacked just the same, in writing his books mainly about poets from
a press on which he is an editor. But, for Heaven's sake, isn't this a
way of a critic putting money where the mouth is: not just writing about
groundbreaking writing of the past, but trying to get current groundbreakers
into print, and read? Pound would have thought so. And just as Pound and
Davie, Perloff has her favourites: Thank God, a criticism motivated by
pleasure and excitement and a feel of radical energy, instead of politcal
correctness!
        This is why, as a gender-conscious writer, I am reluctant to enter
the discussion about gender we've been having; if I criticise any writer,
it is on non-sexist grounds, and yet in such an atmosphere, it won't be
seen that way. If I do have reservations about Perloff's writing, it is
that writers she dislikes (eg Larkin) get attacked in a way that seems to
use very big weapons (MacKinnon-like psychoanalytic equating of pathetic
male bravado as evidence of ... well, actually, self-hatred in a man who
didn't actually do much real harm to all the people he privately and
rhetorically fumed at; being part of New Criticism, when he hated academic
dissection of work; being "fascist" - sic - for fantasising the destruction
of all high culture, in favour of low culture; how can "fascist" mean
anything then, when Pound wanted the reverse of Larkin and is also fascist?

And reservation two would be, but this is not uncommon on this list, that
Perloff gives so little time to anarchist thinking - and Davidson's Product
seems to me to a very anarchistic book, in the sense of Prince Kropotkin
and Colin Ward. As with a lot of the writers she discusses, the politics
are often statist socialism, and the rhetoric harsh enough to storm the
bastille with. Davidson's is angry, but also not wanting to be President.
Again, I don't think either approach is wrong, and again, looked at
realistically, statist radicalism energises more people, and energised
people in a state of change is not to be sniffed at. But I would, certainly,
like to see Perloff continue to be a fascinating and impassioned critic
writing very publically, and find some room - as Davie does sometimes -
to appraise a writer with a very different strategy almost as if it was
worth believing in. Even if she doesn't, she's still a writer I will
always read, annoyed or not. I missed this sense of acknowledgement in
the attack on her. She's not the enemy, she's the energising rival.
Emotionally one may be provoked by her critical skill and wish it were
directed at one's own favourites - precisely because it's good prose. Product
is a good favourite to have, a good thing to have an emotion about, but
I suggest that, only by humbly honouring what is good about each other,
will we see that good prose written about our own favourites - by writing
in emulation of a powerful (female) contemporary, ourselves.

I'm very worried that Chris is correct here; that what we might be talking

but could be the result. I've seen stuff happen like this on lists before,
ie, someone complains about "the overload of irrelevancies," asks for more
"discipline," and what makes lists fun and important, the spontaneity,
the misunderstandings that lead to more productive posts, vanish.
     But hey, this comes from perhaps one of those "exhibitionists,"
maybe? Maybe in some way that obviates my remarks?

David McAleavey is way too modest. He's been a fine poet for at least 25
years that I know of and can take credit for having published, via Ithaca
House Press, the first books of yours truly, Bob Perelman, and David
Melnick, as well as Ray DiPalma's second (Soli). In fact, I met Ray first
through that connection back when Ray still taught at Bowling Green in
Ohio. McAleavey is also the man who taught me to play chess, but that's
another story.

When I ran a writers workshop in the Tenderloin in SF (1979-81),
something on the order of 250 different people would attend one or more
sessions, usually with work in hand, over the course of a year. (There
was a core group of maybe 40 people, 25 of whom could be counted on to
show up every week.) They ranged in age from 14 to upper 70s (one had
been a student of Zukofsky's at SF State in '58), all races, sexual
orientations (there were at least 6 represented), lifestyles, as they
say. Some, like Bob Harrison (Hi, Bob), Marsha Campbell and Mary
Tallmountain have done considerable publishing. One fellow (I'm blanking
on the name) worked on an article that was eventually published in Mother
Jones exposing the presence of PCBs in telephone transformers and
outlining their toxic implications. Bob Holman once attended a session
while visiting SF during which two of the writers had a serious
disagreement over the details of Santeria and put hexes on one another.
As a result of another incident, the workshop adopted a no guns in class
rule. It was that kind of scene. Kit Robinson ran the same workshop after
I left, as did John Mason. (And Erica Hunt was on the board of directors
for awhile before she moved to NYC.)  It's still happening I believe,
every Wednesday night at Hospitality House, 146 Leavenworth, SF.

What impressed me most was how writing (poetry and fiction mostly, but
not exclusively) was being used by the people in the workshop. It was
very close to Paulo Friere (I probably just butchered that, sorry) and
his use of photography as outlined in Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Writing
provided a form and focus for thinking through their lives in a critical
(in the best sense of that word) fashion. Furthermore, 250 represented
over one percent of the entire community.

It's important to remember that the Tenderloin is one of the poorest
neighborhoods on the west coast (and has been transformed considerably
since I worked there), so these folks in general didn't have a lot of
toys and other distractions (very few were involved in family or even
significantly bonded relationships). But any time you have one percent of
a community writing, it's worth thinking through. The work ranged all
over the map in style and general sophistication and I ran into a couple
of real lumpen writers who were doing amazing things that, to this day,
I've never seen anywhere else (I'm thinking of Harley Kohler and Spider
James Taylor, whom Kit and Erica at least know) and whom to this day have
barely ever been published.

I wonder if I would have gotten one percent in a more rural (or even
suburban) setting. Out where I work in Southeastern Alameda County,
there's only one visible literary movement: romance novelists. There are
between 20 and 24 publishing romance novelists out here, who will all be
happy to tell you that 40 percent of all paperback books bought and sold
are in their genre.  They range between Christian Fundamentalist
"housewives" (that's a self-designation) to a biker couple out in
Livermore. Since I don't read that genre, I can't tell you a lot more,
but I get a sense that for them a magazine like Writers Digest is a
living tool in a way that no poet has ever found it.

But whenever/wherever I travel, I come across local writing communities
that suggest that something much like this use of the written word is
very widespread just beneath the surface. Certainly a look at the poetry
items on the Usenet groups suggests that a dimension is going on there as
well. One percent of the US population is over 2,000,000 people. So it
wouldn't shock me at all to discover that one million really do write,
maybe half of them writing poems. If Jimmy Carter's writing poems, who
isn't? (And yes, Marjorie, I want you to read ALL of it.)

This is where the "clubbiness" of so much of the "world" of the poetry as
outlined in the NYT seems completely nuts.(Charles Alexander is
completely right about that.)  And why even worrying about a failed
institution like the Times seems ultimately a waste of breath. There is a
hell of a lot of poetry out there. And, under the right conditions,
there's an audience for almost all of it. Amen!

Subject:      Re: Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, separate bodies

I'm dropping into this conversation very late, but something caught my eye:


The question of a distinct body of critical, theoretical, or prescriptive
writings in a poet's work makes me proceed with caution...but as long as we
are on the subject of Loy, Barnes, Stein, I wondered what Gary Sullivan
(excuse me if I'm misdirecting this response) thought about Loy's
"International Psycho-Democracy," "The Artist and the Public,"  "Phenomenon
in American Art," or her many Aphorisms or "Feminist Manifesto," as well as
the essay on Stein mentioned by Marisa Januzzi?  Although I am infinitely
more interested in the theoretical implications of work such as "Brancusi's
Golden Bird" or "Love Songs,"  the examples above are clearly
self-consciously didactic statements.  I would agree with Marisa Januzzi that
the social dimensions of Loy's work feed her aesthetic sensibilities.  "What
counts as theory?" --certainly "Love Songs to Joannes" or "Anglo-Mongrels and
the Rose"!  But...how could one say that Loy has no separate theoretical
body???  In Roger Conover's edition of The Last Lunar Baedeker, he even
portions out several works under such a title in the table of contents...

Dear David McAleavey,

Your post on community and poetry interests me a great deal: the issue
you foreground is similar, in fact, to a dissertation topic i'm working
on: poetry/storytelling/moral law/community. It'll be a few more months
before i actually start to approach the thing concretely; however, i do
know that i want to focus on bpNichol's long poem THE MARTYROLOGY. i
think it's an excellent text which raises new questions re the relation
between theory & practice, theory/praxis, and interdisciplinarity
, as well as questions of community, communal, sacred & visionary.

i'm very interested in hearing more about your work-

-and looking forward to meeting you in the machine, so to speak

Take care,

Carl Peters

PS: hope this message gets to you without any distortions. i'm new to the
system and its one i haven't really felt comfortable with nonetheless

Dividing the list won't improve what ends up in my to-be-read box on my
receiving system at all, just increase the number of sources I get mail
from. I also wouldn't be especially happy w/ a list moderator system
(like the Sixties List has, for example). The Sixties List for example
has kept off messages about the NEH battle, partly because it's not "on
topic" but really I suspect more because a professional rightwinger like
David Horowitz is on the list, ready to pounce on any "misuse" of an
"edu" domain. I appreciate the contentious nature of some of the messages
on the Poetics List and wish only that a broader community of poets were
here and active.

Someone mentioned a New Formalist listserv awhile back. Does anybody have
subscription info to that? Inquiring minds want to know.

Subject:      NY School

A compleat map/geneology (can't decide whether I prefer a spatial or
temporal metaphor here) of the NY School would probably take about 10
dissertations to get half accurate.

I'm always amazed at how individual poets (including individual "NY
School" poets) seem to draw the lines. I've never seen two the same. Not
even remotely.

I've heard arguments, like the one Darrell Gray used to make, that you
couldn't "get" O'Hara until you saw how he extended the work of David
Schubert, whose work came back into print awhile ago thanks to Ted Weiss.
And at Naropa last summer I met students who had taken classes on the NY
School who'd NEVER even read Koch. And had not heard him mentioned in the
course (at least so they said, and they were not what Ginsberg refers to
as the "chemical derangement of the senses" students either).

One thing does seem clear: it is the only one of the so-called New
American Poetries that has maintained a sense of unbroken
intergenerational continuity over close to half a century. That's pretty
amazing. But I'm not sure what it means.

My theory is this: it means that the "first generation" didn't actively
halt or stomp on the second one (FOH was dead, Ashbery still in Europe,
Schuyler a recluse and Koch seems to have been actively supportive of
younger poets) and once a more diverse scene was established, nobody was
in control and something like a laisez farie democracy ensued. Permission
and support is actually a pretty good model on how to behave toward
younger poets. It doesn't hurt when the younger people are as forceful as
Anne Waldman or Ted Berrigan either.

At my 3,000+ mile distance, I got my sense of the scene most constantly
through Tom Clark's Paris Review editing (which to this day still seems
to me to be the most significant contribution he's made), not realizing
that he was not in NYC and that some of his pals (Clark Coolidge for one)
weren't either. More than any of the anthologies or more local mags, it's
the image I still carry in my head.

I know people who love Koch and people who can't stand him but who
consider themselves "NYS" influenced. Personally, I think  _When the Sun
Tries to Go On_ is one of the great longpoems of the 20th century, but
I'm more ambivalent about the broader satirical pieces. I think we have a
different sense of baseball.

W/ my own lumpen background, I just don't "get" some of the influences on
NY School poets (esp. in the first generation) from, for example, British
and/or American academic poets (Auden, Bishop) etc and from musical
theater. Ashbery, for one, never seems to have worried about his
relationship to the Pound/WCW tradition and that distance from what I
(especially as an anxious youngster, ready to "take sides") saw as the
more rigorous post-Olsonian attempts at articulating a social theory of
the line. They just didn't seem to worry about theory. (In fact, worry
isn't a major theme in their work as I think it is for several of us, tho
I'm not sure what to make of this either, tho I'm a little envious.)

One thing I see today when I think of "NY School" is that there are a lot
of women empowered within its tradition, such as Lee Ann Brown and Eileen
Myles, and that it still seems to be evolving, interesting and sometimes
quite powerful.

Dear Tony Green:

If you want to define theory that broadly, then we have less
argument--none in terms as you've extended my statement about
"anticipation." I personally think this is where poetics and theory don't
overlap. Where poetics is but theory isn't would be the most necessary
area to me--and the least dangerous.

         BUFFALO (AHP) - Heir to the throne Prince Charles took
his young son Gary and daughter Cass hunting yesterday, defying
popular disapproval to initiate them into a traditional poetic
pastime.
          ``I think anyone who knows anything about the history of
poetry can tell you, the skills necessary for tracking and killing
an animal are similar to those required for ruling the Imagination,''
said Yunte Huang, a spokesman for the Prince.
         ``It was ... like shooting fish in a barrel,'' gushed the
excited princess.  ``I wanna go out again.''
         The royal trio were lashed by rain for several hours as they
rode with the down-jacketed Poetics Hunt across rolling hills near
Charles' country estate, The Fountainview Apartments, in Amherst.

          Gary, 10, and Cass, 12, have ridden at earlier meets but
devotees of the sport said this was their first full-fledged
critic hunt.
          Charles, often accused of being out of touch with
contemporary developments in poetry, has insisted his heirs should
learn to hunt despite the anger of opponents who say the sport is
bloodthirsty and cruel.

dear ron---thank you for taking up on marissa's NYS post. There's many
questions I'm interested. The assumptiomn that NYS poets don't worry???
There is the sense of the "laissez faire" Ashbery, the failure to write
"critical (non-poetic) prose", the question of the relation to the Pound-
Williams tradition (which is a whole other question---though I hear much
talk of it, and Marjorie Perloff's perception that hardly anyone is both
deeply engaged with both POUND AND STEVENS is interesting---One thing here
is that instead of Pound and Williams as the "forward looking" and Stevens
and Eliot as the "backward looking" of those "big 4" male modernists, there
is an equally valid contention that Stevens and Williams are the more
"forward looking" and Pound and Eliot "backward"--to say nothing of Loy,
Moore, Stein, Riding...but I DIGRESS)...
Anyway, reading Auden lately it's clearer and clearer to me his debt to
Riding (stylistically if not sensibility wise)...and Riding (who Ashbery
claimed among the three biggest Am.
nfluences) is as rigorously THEORETICAL
(though that's not quite the MOT JUSTE) as Pound. In fact, contrasting
THREE POEMS with THE TELLING (published less than a year apart) could be
a very illuminating academic paper (hint, hint). I'm only "scratching the
surface" but i'll shut up now. But, there IS a nother question that has
been on my mind, RON, since you posted your NEW YEAR'S NOTE invoking Leanne.
I'm curious why you consider her a NEW YORK SCHOOL poet? It can't be quite
the "historical" reason Tom gave for calling himself a LANG PO? Is it because
she was IN NYC? Is Waldman a NYS poet? She's not (historically) a beat? But
what does one call those who address the same issues the beats did but are
not males with gottees and bongoes (as Jerome Sala would point out)? Not
that this name game really matters (i feel silly quibbling about it) but
I am curious about how "affiliations" are constructed from the outside in.

Subject:      Re: Stein, Loy, H.D, et al

I'm afraid that at the time I entered my message I had not read Gary
Sullivan's posting fully because its subject title was regarding Sun and Moon.
 As I'm a subscriber to four fairly busy lists, I tend to skim through a lot
of messages then sit down and go through the ones that might be of
interest when I have more time.  I realize now that I should have read
your posting more fully as you were converging the issues in a way that I
hoped somebody would.  This is probably a bit out of date now but I
thought I should apologize.

As far as earlier experimental writers (not necessarily women) who bring
up feminist issues in their writing, Gary covered many of the women
that are already fairly institutionalized on academic courses (and H.D.
was also mentioned-thanks).

Perhaps it are those who are not so well known that also need to be mentioned
if not just for revising the poetic map.  Although Lorine Niedecker never
wrote any essays as far as I know on theory in the same way that Stein or
Loy did, her letters are full of her debating the feminist implications
that certain directions in poetry may hold (Daphne Marlatt's vs Jean
Daive minimalism for instance). Perhaps it is because she was on the edge of
what has since been seen as a "movement" that she has been recently recovered,
whereas there are many other writers who still remain forgotten-women who
did not have the support network that people like Stein and Niedecker
did.  How many indigenous North American women writers have been
mentioned on this list, let alone from other non-European and
non-American countries?  In the 1920s in Australia, Lesbia Harford was
exploring the relationship between class and gender through her poetry in
ways that overlap with Niedecker and others.  Yet, she remains largely
unknown not only here but elsewhere.  She's just one that I
thought I'd mention.

I also apologize for my icecream 'melt'-we have the NZ icecream co over
here & I might have discovered hokey pokey icecream through it.  What
came first-tutti frutti or hokey pokey might be more a question of which
came first-the chicken or the banana peel.  I would also like to put a
vote towards keeping the list together-at least for now.  I don't know
quite how you could toughen up on moderating the list-how have other
lists handled the problem?  Does anyone know?

Genuinely fascinated by the nature of this medium, cf. Cris Cheek's
succinct summary of its virtues and possibilities, (already quoted). The
cocktail, book-launch, preview party is an apt metaphor, as much for the
implied power/gender structures as for the indication of a likely tone.

And the gallery is in the background, behind the chit-chat and idle banter
with some fine works to be viewed over a quiet drink once you are cut loose
from some particular conversation (although here the situation and the talk
are the works). The latter image pertinent because one of the valued and
to-be-defended aspects of visiting, say, a gallery is the ability to move
past art works at high velocity dismissing whatever at the time seems
irrelevant, distasteful or plain bad -- in the not-so-secret knowledge that
what you are dismissing may be (is) important, interesting even great work.
No one is forced to attend to anything in a gallery space and DOS forbid
that they ever should be.

Just so, our mailboxes are clogged but we have the power to empty them as
necessary or desirable. Decisions like that should be left as close to the
grassroots as possible, as a matter of principle.

Finally, in this discussion surely the ludic, the occasional piece/fragment
of poetics, parody, whatever is not only to be expected but encouraged,
allowed to become a integrated part of the more usual discursive
contributions? No, personal letters (unless they are open) shouldn't be
posted (it can be embarrassing) but if you didn't overhear something like
their contents from time to time it would spoil atmosphere of the party.


You want to be someone else or to become part of the process.

Dear Michael:

Touche'. Personally speaking, I didn't bring her up because: (a) I haven't
read enough of her work to feel comfortable doing that; (b) others
(notably Barbara Guest) have written extensively about her; and (c)
because I haven't yet started to read her work, I didn't know if she was
appropriate to bring up in the context in which I brought up Loy, Stein &
Barnes.

While I've got you here, Michael: loved your "Well, sometimes you get
there and sometimes/ the there gets you, a simple fact of how/ turns it,
a space of shifting constellations// at war with the mill"--from your
series of poems in the new _First Intensity_. Very nice, that; liked the
whole series, actually.

My disk has been full and has prevented me from responding for some time.
Anyway, I have to note that Larry Grossberg speaking of doing
pure theory must provoke peels of laughter.  My goodness.
There is also something laughable about this talk of boy vs girl//
theory vs practice.  I suppose there might be no escaping certain
essential desires to repeat the same old shit, but really!!!
It was not any particular woman who exposed Freud's misogyny, he wrote it
there for all to see.  Furthermore, Hegel's bold statement that neither
women nor Blacks could DO philosophy was hardly unprecedented.  What can
one say to such statements?  It seems to me that they speak their own
hysteria.  I became aware recently of how sad this state of affairs remains
when, in a theory group I was leading, I said, "well, one is tired of
white boys business as usual."  One of my male colleagues, feeling
interpellated, it seems, said that he didn't like being referred to as
a boy.  Shit, the things that remain unquestioned!!!!  I would hope, in
any case, that ideas about policing the list that appear in such words as
those I read in a post my Michael Boughn (pronounced Bone, I would say)
that one should "get some police" in order to keep the list "hard,
precise, penetrating" would be read as both high parody and hysteria.
Moments like that, even just the sound of, "police," "precise," "penetrating"
over the supposedly eviscerated electronic net, would be argument enough to
open the list--even if, as one bro. suggested, one decides to read
only the postings from the "names" one knows to be guantors of interesting
stuff.A cop with a big cock, who could resist?  Who among us would cast. . .

In any case, theory aside, I have noticed that certain sorts of behaviors are
expected by women, others suspect.  I wonder, though, how the name or
category WOMEN seems again so clear.  This list, if I may say so, seems
to have fallen for several rather worn labels and strategies.  I was
especially struck, after so many interesting (??) postings about poetry
and the "public" to see a suggestion that certain things should be
kept off or in another list; that some things should not be put
before "the public."  Is this list now the long lamented absent public.
Funny, too, that public should also devolve to PUBIK, as Ted Joans might
pun.

Oh, sorry.  Puns, let alone irony, insinuation, and insolence aren't,
any more than invidious profanity (?), particularly woman-ish.
How about getting away from the program, boys and girls?

Subject:      Re: Gender and theory

Having just subscribed 2 weeks ago I am new to this kind of list email thing.
Wanted to put my woman's voice into the mix. We are all survivors of
patriarchy, that fact is genderless. How you choose to respond to that fact
is up to your response - ability. The kind of continuous one-upsmanship, king
of the heap games that are seem apparent on this list are characteristic of a
patriarchal system in my opinion.

 About what Alan Golding wrote:
"On the recent theory exchanges: interesting that the theory discussion and
the boy/girl talk have been going on simultaneously but in parallel lines,
without much crossover. What's the relation between theory (the tendency to
theorize, the kind of theorizing that gets done) and gender?"

I found the gender discussion to be the more interesting of the two threads.
To me the theory discussion seems kind of weird - do I really read that some
people are saying that to be a good poet you have to be a theorist as well?
Sorry, but this makes no sense to me. Unless the idea is that by writing and
thinking about what you write and how effectively your creativity is working
you are doing theory. Theory that interests me the most is more experiential
- based on this is what has happened to me or what I have observed in the
stream of life and this is what I think about that, less academic in nature
than what is being posted, I'd say. I'm willing to read the more technical
and academic stuff, but probably less likely to participate in those
discussions. Don't know if this is gender based, but it might be, does seem
to fit in a little with what other women are saying about responding more to
the personal.

P.S. - Don't divide the list - sounds like a control issue to me!

 Subject: Main poetics channel to reject messages
 Copyright: 1999 by The Anti-Hegemony Project

          CYBERSPACE (AHP) - New York State's main state-run poetics
 channel said yesterday it would stop posting responses to messages
 because they were causing too much social disruption.
          BoweryBoysVision (BBV) made the surprise announcement just a
 week after President James Sherry imposed a ban on discussion of ``ice
 cream'' and ``personal well being,'' a move industry executives
 said would hit the major poetics channels.
          An announcer on the main evening news read out a statement
 from BBV directors saying the outpouring of chat had recently
 ``been the source of great irritation and disappointment.''
          ``Therefore we have taken the decision to stop broadcasting
 personal messages until strict rules are set up to regulate discussion
 in interests of the economic development of society and ethnical norms.''

          The statement did not say when the ban would come into
 effect or how BBV would make up the huge loss of programming
 such a step would entail.
          BBV and its main rival, the Co-poetry News Network (CNN),
 came under heavy fire last year for showing continuous advertisements
 by the ``Freely Espousing'' investment fund, which lured millions
 of poets into parting with their work just before share prices were
 slashed.
          Although the government declined to ban ``Freely Espousing,''
 this and other poetics projects were relegated to subsidiary channels.
          ``Our task is to create mutual understanding and agreement
 in society,'' the BBV statement said at the time.
         ``In the best of all possible worlds,'' said Sherry, ``the
 one man one vote principle would be extended to poetivision -- one
 poet one channel.''
          The new ban, which comes into effect from the moment it is
 published in tomorrow's official government digest, said poets defying
 the ban would be sued and their words appropriated for use in Lang-Po
 Labs infomercials.

Subject:      Where to find Thorpe's books

Everyone:

Many responses backchannel re: Thorpe, asking where to find his books. I
believe (last time I checked) Small Press Distribution has the four I
mentioned. Most of you have that address, but maybe not everyone (it's a
great one to have, if you don't):

Small Press Distribution
1814 San Pablo Avenue
Berkeley, CA  94702   USA
(510) 549-3336

Write or call them for a catalog--I *think* the catalog's free. Anyone in
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area can borrow my copies of Thorpe's books;
just ask.

I was told by someone not on this list that Thorpe does have a book of
"theory" out (I stand corrected). It's not in SPD's catalog; it was a
mimeo or Xeroxed & stapled book that (maybe) Duncan McNaughton published.
Whether or not copies are still available's uncertain. Stephen Ratcliffe,
do you know?

Li and Lang Po are definite not related although they do have something in

Dear Kathryne:

I thought, when I read Michael's post, it was tongue-in-cheek, and that
he was *against* the idea of "policing." Maybe I need to switch to a
breakfast cereal without the added irony?

Anyway, I agree with you that the list shouldn't be regulated, policed,
and certainly not divided up. The whole point seems to be to bring poets
& critics & afficionados together, & see what happens. We're not here to
perform Shakespeare. (Unless we want to do that, too, I guess.)

As to the whole "boy/girl" discussion, I don't think anyone
here is saying that men & women have different capacities for and/or
interests in theory. I've liked reading what people have to say about
this, actually; it seems to be one of the more generative topics
currently under discussion. I know Colleen Lookingbill, and her post in re
this subject was one of the few times I've read what she has to say about
"how" she writes, what drives it. It was nice to get that. I'd like her
poetry regardless of whether or not she ever wanted to talk privately or
publicly about it, but this was a nice bonus, reading her confirm what
I'd suspected--that hers is a poetry of personal experience (despite how
it might otherwise appear at first glance).

But, we sometimes have to ask questions to get at this stuff, to get
people talking about X, Y, or Z, and sometimes, granted, the questions
might seem simplistic, or backwards, or whathaveyou. A week or so before
I got on this list, someone told me that someone (& my memory's not the
best, so forgive me if I don't get this completely right) had said that
they were afraid that people might think them "dumb" if they asked
questions or responded, and someone else had responded: "What's wrong
with that?" I totally agree. Someone once said that there are no correct
answers, only correct questions. (Or something to that effect.) Well, how
do you know which questions are the "right" ones until you've started
asking?

Anyway. I did appreciate your post. Thanks.

--Gary

Dear Ira:

Thank you much for such a well-considered response. I'd backchannel this
to you, but you probably weren't the only one who felt I was attacking
Marjorie, so I'd like to address that. I was, certainly, put off by what
I felt to be Marjorie's pooh-poohing of the great unwashed on this list,
the people she doesn't know. My post was not meant as an attack. I was
questioning her, questioning specifically her raising the issue of
cleansing the list of undesireables. (The fact that I've read _Radical
Artifice_ [and other of her books] seems to suggest I've granted her a
certain amount of respect, moreso than she seems to want to grant to
her non-chums on this list.) I'd meant to suggest that, if she was more
open to listening to & being available to others outside of her circle of
friends (which we all have, of course), it would make her
criticism--which I think is fine--even more valuable. Someone suggested
to me, "backchannel," that Marjorie is a "friendly" critic, not an
"enemy" critic. I don't think of critics (or reporters, like Dinitia
Smith) as either. I do think she has a certain amount of responsibility,
especially as such a visible critic (one of few mentioned in that _Times_
article). And the questions I posted to her were originally questions that
came up as I was reading _Radical Artifice_ a year or so ago. I liked the
book, was definitely "on her side" reading it, but if *I* could have
these questions about the appropriateness of certain work in that
context, maybe I'm not the only one out here who does.
        Cape's (or Cope's?) "article" on foxhunting was too kind to me;
I'm not 10, I'm more like 5 or 6--meaning I've only been reading &
writing & thinking about poetry for 5 or 6 years--and if someone as new
to this as I am sees or considers significant (Bern Porter) "missings" in
a book on Media & Poetry ... well, it made me really begin to question
the book, what it really was (beyond its stated intentions). I had always
wanted to write to Marjorie about that book, and once I got onto this
list, I saw an opportunity. Unfortunately, it arrived with what I felt
was a very disappointing post of hers. If it hadn't been for that post,
I'd still have asked, though perhaps not as indignantly. Despite all the
things you say about her work, what it gives you (& I agree), I still
have those questions. Assuming this "a" and "b" list (which I don't
understand, being new) refers to groups of people ("a=stars"
"b=unwashed") ... well, if it's ever implemented as such, I'm sure I'll
never get any answers. Mostly my loss.
        Anyway, thanks very much for the response. It's much appreciated.

Subject:      NYT article

   By way of brief introduction since this is my first post
(I am a "boy" of fifty+ in truth and not posting under a
male pseudonym):  I am a psychologist in private
practice in Nashville who has recently revived an interest
in poetry and poetics with some minor success.
   I think I a much more coherent and relevant article than
Dinita, and one that raises some issues that are worthy of
discussion.  I do have to apologize for my anti-academic
bias: this stems from earlier experiences of mine when I
was an academic, and I have since moderated these views to
some extent.
   This article appeared in the November/December 1994
issue of _Educom Review_ the hard-copy journal of EDUCOM
and is also on their gopher.

                     LIVING LANGUAGE

        Today a child was shot in my daughter's school.  Last
week a local dealer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting.
This is life today.  In the _American Poetry Review_, Eavan
Boland tells of distress at her inability to include
"awkward and jagged pieces of reality" in the decorums of poetry
she admires.  Can can we afford a literature that doesn't deal
with jagged andawkward reality?

        Dana Gioia calls for poetry to become an important part
of American culture when he asks, "Can Poetry Matter?"  Poetry
is read aloud today in coffeehouses and bars, even if it has not
yet gotten all the way to the street.  These are signals of the
emerging reintegration of poetry and life.


        In an even more significant development, vital and
authentic poetry is appearing on the Internet and its byways.
People who do not have a post-graduate degree in English are
actually writing and reading poetry in discussion groups on
bulletin boards, commercial services, and elsewhere on
the "information superhighway," working to incorporate today's
realities into today's e-literature.  They do this in a way
that traditional writing has never been able to do, at least
in a way that reaches significant numbers of American readers
and listeners.

        The Internet is more than just another venue for writers.
It has opened up the field for a new audience and new material
whose vitality and authenticity give hope to those yearning to lead
literature out of the academy and onto the computer screens of
America, if not actually out onto the streets.

        The essence of capturing a slice of life in poetry or prose
lies in the struggle to express it well or authentically.  These
writers on the Internet are (with help from more experienced
fellow writers) struggling to express life as they experience it.
In more traditional and academic writing this vision is often
missing.  I think these "awful" or "bad" (see "Bards on the
Internet", _Time_, July 4, 1994) writers are the wave of the
future.

        This e-poetry is seen by some as "awful" and, indeed,
it does have its awful moments (and hours and days).  But it
is wrestling with a reality that doesn't require a post-graduate
degree in writing to appreciate.  Even though it has not yet
found its appropriate form, that will come with time, as it
did for the Russian revolutionary Futurists and others. The
search for a new content and form in literature and other
arts often accompanies social revolutions, and particularly
those associated with technological change.

        Since this poetry is seeking to express the essence of
what the writers are experiencing, the appropriate form will
likely reflect the vital (and even frenetic) rhythms of life
today along with a fascination with e-life.  Rap and beat and
hip-hop song and poetry and poetry bands in bars are precursors
of what will come, but the final flowering will happen on the

To all those worried about cluttered mailboxes: have you tried the
"digest" option?  The discussion does feel a little less "live" &
somewhat more "archived," but it certainly helps to receive only one
"message" per day rather than 30.  It also makes it possible for me
to print the whole thing out as one file if I get tired of perusing
pixels.

On the other hand, it's a lot easier for a day or days to slip by w/out
me getting around to poetics stuff at all.  I guess my personal jury is
still out, but i'd recommend that people give it a shot to see if it
alleviates their particular difficulties with navigating the infopoglut.

>is it true that lang po means "inscrutable solace" in mandarin?

A number of posible replies:

1) Is it true that "lang po" means "tongue skin" in French?

2) Whose transciption system are we using? Hopeful assumption is that the
LangPo-friendly will have gone over to the sinocentric system (pinyin)
where 'P' approximates more to the 'P' of 'Po', but perhaps old liberal
traditions die hard and Free-China-familiars are looking up a 'Po' that's
more like 'Bo'. (... and what about the vowels?)

3) The only (commonish) surname with Lang as transcription is Lang2 (Xinhua
Zidian 248.4). Perhaps a good choice in view of the boytalk thread because
it was used as a pronoun-like word for young males and a word translatable
as 'darling' which females addressed to males. The 'Po' surely has to be
Po3 (Xinhua Zidian 337.2) 'impossible' (now only in literary registers).
It's good graph too.

4) No. But you can be sure there is a dictionary out there somewhere that
will answer yes.

5) Run this:

on theMeaning_ofLangPo
  put "darling,wolf,corridor,veranda,hammer,chain,mantis,light,bright,
    loud,clear,wave,billow,breaker,unrestrained,dissolute" into Lang
  put "lake,slope,sprinkle,spill,rude,unreasonable,shrewish,oblique,
    biased,partial,quite,rather,considerably,matchmaker,midwife,white,
    impossible,hackberry,compel,force,press,urgent,pressing,approach,
    broken,damaged,torn,break,split,destroy,defeat,capture,expose,
    reveal,paltry,lousy,soul,vigour,spirit" into Po
  put word (the random of the number of items in Lang) of Lang into Lang
  put word (the random of the number of items in Po) of Po into Po
  answer "the meaning of LangPo is " & Lang & space & Po
end theMeaning_ofLangPo

(only slightly selective from _A Chinese-English Dictionary_, 1978)

Answer number 3 above would be "darling impossible" for example.

I do apologize to Gary S for sounding what he took to be dismissive of
those "I don't know."  I really didn't mean to sound that way.  I was
writing (so far as reading all the messages go) out of sincere perplexity
as to time frames.  Maybe it's just me but it seems that I'm totally
overloaded with endless daily tasks that include writing on an average of
a letter or two of recommendation a day, being graduate adviser and
figuring out whether X can get rid of his or her language requirement by
taking whatever "unusual" language or whether I can get around the Old
English requirement by allowing someone to do Dante and so on.  So I guess
my complaint has less to do with the poetics discussion group than with a
general perplexity as to how to get through the day in the current academy.
Therefore, when I turned on the Mac at night and found all those endless
messages, it seemed overwhelming.  But now that I have it as a "digest" it's
really much better.  And it did bring in that piece from Ira, which is
certainly one of the nicest reviews I've ever had.  So who can complain?

Enough on that front for a while, I hope....

In-Reply-To:  <199502270806.AAA23606@slip-1.slip.net>

I appreciate this forum, and I think it's great that more people are
contributing, both women and men.

The following is an attempt to respond to all those who wrote me over the
past week, plus others who didn't. It is also an attempt to clarify or do
a better job of indicating certain feelings and concerns that I have
about the literary world today.

1) My argument is not with theory per se. My argument involves claims that
are made for theory, uses to which it is put and effects it often has.

2) I am for the freedom of the individual to think things through for
hirself. To do that, s/he must fend off or overcome pressures to conform to
correct ideas, which today are formidable.

3) I believe the discourse and social reality surrounding poetry has
become more important than the poetry itself. When I said poetry was on
its own level, that was nothing more than an attempt to counter this sense
of skewed priority that I feel pervades the scene.

4) I am concerned about the degree to which all communication surrounding
the poetry is framed as "literary politics." I am concerned about the
dominance of this frame, the way it all becomes a game we play at to the
detriment of our art and its greatest goals.

5) What's matters to people in this literary world is not community. What
matters is spheres of influence. Each person's spheres are a little
different and some have more or broader spheres than others. But these
spheres are not communities because they are motivated and defined
entirely by the dynamics of personal and literary influence.

6) Much energy is directed toward appreciating and understanding those
within one's approximated spheres of influence. (The stronger the sphere
or link, the more the energy.) Far too often, alienation is the keynote
with respect to everyone else. Alienation and a tendency to project the
blame and responsibility for problems onto an elsewhere as variously
perceived or defined.

7) Denial is an important part of the game. There are many different ways
of denial, too many to list here. It may be that denial, more than
anything else, is what keeps people playing, what allows them to stay
focused and do what is necessary to be a good competitor.

8) What about the person who can't or won't play this game? My feeling is,
s/he doesn't have much chance. My feeling is, you're forced to play if you
want to survive as a creatively engaged poet in this world today.

      The list called "Prosody" has mostly been taken over by linguists,
phonologists, phoneticists, etc and is very strong on things like
glottal clicks.

Dear H.T. Kirby-Smith:

Although it's not specifically dedicated to poetry, the
Philosophy-Literature list seems to contain many of the people you're
looking for. I checked out a while ago, after the list boss proposed
Timothy Steele as the height of American achievement in poetry.

Good hunting.

In response to Ron's, Spencer's, and Colleen's posts:

Ron, I DID frequent the Hospitality House, but as a painter, not a writer.
The place is proof that there are lots of poets/artists out there that are
interested in more than politics, and in being a part of a community that may
not have much to give back in return in terms of professional advancement (or
whatever the hell you call it).  Without the Hospitality House, my stay in
San Fran would have been worse, to say the least.  And, man, I know a lot of
the people that worked there worked for just a few pennies, for a living!

Spencer, I agree with you that theory is used as a power tool too often, and
that at the same time it can be useful, and that the poem is what counts (if
anything counts at all), whatever is brought to it.  But isn't this politics
bullshit something we're going to find ANYWHERE there is more than one
person?  I hate it as much as you do, but I've never managed to get away from
it.  Wether its working with a road crew, living in a half-way house, buying
hash in Morocco, or programming for a corporation.  The trick seems to me to
be that if it happens, to see that it doesn't happen destructively.  Or, if
it does happen in a "bad" way, to BURN it.

I just want to re-iterate one of Colleen's comments:

We are all survivors of patriarchy, that fact is genderless. How you choose
to respond to that fact is up to your response - ability. The kind of
continuous one-upsmanship, king of the heap games that seem apparent on this
list are characteristic of a patriarchal system in my opinion.

I agree whole-heartedly.  One up-manship?, shit, I thought that didn't exist
in the poetry world (call me naive).  As much as I want to read lots of
theory (as general and almost meaningless as that term is), in response to
anyone that wants to force it down my throat, well, I have lots and lots of
crude responses to make.  Plus a few things to throw.  Is that
unprofessional?

Subject:      Thoughts About Engagement

Spencer's most recent post quite clearly crystallizes some of the concerns
that have been discussed around theory/participation/community and the like.
 His post brings to mind for me the extent to which it perhaps always has
been true that there's little room, certainly in art, and probably in most
things, for the pure entity of THE PROCESS AND WHAT'S MADE to exist without
that entity's being propped up by loads of self promotion.  An unspoken kind
of currency exists in many realms of endeavor.  Specifically, having
"something to trade," some commodity to hold/exchange/seek that puts one on
the board at all.  This offering can take the form of publishing, producing
programs, critical perspective published or spoken, and undoubtedly several
more.  Spoken opinion or assessment concerning someone's work, where and how
it fits, what new ground it breaks, etc., has particularly high value
associated with it.  To me, it has always been true that this kind of
exchange pattern has been present.  But with the abundance of material and of
distribution channels (be they small/large, unofficial/official), including
the machines we can access to share them, there's been an escalation of need
to create focus on any given work. (Sort out something that seems to deserve
light)  However people fare within this system, combined with their own needs
for recognition, (and these are not the sole variables!)  seems to connect to
levels of frustration or levels of felt reward.  I suspect that the struggle
to be counted forces many people to have to expend far more effort than they
would choose just getting into the middle of things and being perceived as
complete..  This, of course, can rob time from producing work one cares about
producing..  I feel this among people in the earnings world, too.  So much
energy goes into getting one's name out about one's business services, etc.,
that there's too little time (sometimes) left for doing what one does. This
whole issue seems pertinent to the theory question within the world of
practice.  I hate to put theory into the category of "must do," as though it
were something no one would do if they didn't have to, because it's at least
potentially worthy and elegant and illuminating an a thing unto itself.
(Transcending the level of inventing a frame within which to illuminate what
one is doing!)    But for some people, at least the writing about writing
aspect is a price to pay to get closer to what is wanted.

I have no particular answer for this except to say that the sooner one can
pursue something at the center of her or his passionate concerns, without the
requirement of having to "pay dues," the more satisfying and possibly
meaningful the work can become.  I suppose that dues paying will always be
with us (But try not to think of it as often as I think about my work!)

Hi James, thanks for posting that rationale again. I must have missed it
the first time, since I'm suddenly getting so much e-mail and ironically,
find it hard to get the time to read it all. Also I tend to read shorter
messages first with the express intention of going back to look more
thoroughly over what look like longer, maybe more complex posts. Sometimes,
I forget which ones I mean to go back to. Sometimes I'm printing certain
posts out because I want to respond to them but also want to unclog the
space. I'm thinking about this issue of community as raised recently. The
size of this 'community' must be getting up towards that 250 which Ron
identified for Tenderloin. I'm a (now relative) newcomer  -  it seems
positively active, with a rapid convergence and hexvergence across agendas.
Obviously more and more people are subscribing at present (any figures
Loss) - there you see I just jumped from what was intended as a so-called
backchannel message to what can now be addressed in part to the whole  -
is there an exponential volume at which point a list such as POETICS might
take on either a debilitating or invigorating entropic quality ? Might not
simply particularised 'loop', as you term them, agendas achieve a measure
of what might help ? I don't appear to be alone in being excited by the way
this list is developing ?
What percentage of people's posts are sent to all subscribers ? My
experience is of posting two-thirds 'privately' and one third 'publicly'
but of getting public to private in a ratio of 2:1.

This list seems yet to be poised to address the issues raised by how to go
beyond being merely a community of interests to becoming a community of
evolving friendships and alliances that both is and also furthers the
development of the work.

Yes, cris, I think that the list at its best can be both interesting in
and of itself in terms of the discussions we can have on it ANd
generative of independent relationships on both one-to-one and sub-group
levels. The effective limits of community are not yet clear, but from
several people's perspective they relate to the number of messages one
can get through considering the available time. This obviously differs
for different people, so the quantifying of community is not possible at
a single value for all participants. What I am looking for is a
suggestion how to "customize" each person's community according to their
capacity and interest. It's a hard question, but I think one worth
working on. It has a lot of assumptions that need to be exposed before we
can get too far. Clearly the group has about 3-1 rejected a simple
division by message type. But as you point out the question does not go
away. I'd still appreciate hearing further responses at this new level. James

From my point of view the question arose about 20 years ago in response
to the New Criticism's perspective, which you and Spencer have affinity
for although not congruence with, that only the poem in itself is a valid
carrier of meaning. Several dozen people have been workingfor 20 years to
expand the view. James

WORK OF NEA IN SAN DIEGO DEFENDED BY REP. BOB FILNER

On 24 February 1995, Democrat Bob Filner made the following remarks in the
context of defending federal funding for the arts:

        "In San Diego County, the San Diego Opera Company and the San Diego
Symphony provide opportunities for kids to attend the opera and symphony
concerts.  The opera regularly goes out to schools with ensemble
performances.
        San Diego's recipients of arts funding range from elementary
schools and universities to KPBS public radio and TV to the Samahan
Philippine Dance Company and the Centro Cultural de la Raza to the Balboa
Park Museums and the Old Globe Theater, groups representing the entire
population of San Diego County.
        TheatreForum, an international theater magazine published at UCSD;
the renowned La Jolla Playhouse whose productions go on to thrill audiences
on Broadway and in the rest of the country; an international festival at
locations on both sides of the border between San Diego and Tijuana,
Mexico; graduate internships at the Museum of Photographic Arts; touring
exhibitions from the Museum of Contemporary Arts in San Diego.  I could go
on and on.  These and hundreds of other art forms are advanced by arts
funding in San Diego County."
(from the Congressional Record, p. H2218)


PROPOSED RESCISSIONS

The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee (Ralph Regular, R-OH, chair)
approved a recision package that included a significant cut to FY 95
funding for the NEA and NEH.

The figures we've seen indicate that if the proposed recisions are
approved, the NEA cut will be $1m (administrative) and $4m (program), with
the bulk of program-budget reductions targeted toward individual artist
grants.

On 16 February, some members of this Subcommittee (only 7 of the 14
actually) had heard testimony from Rep. Amo Houghton (R-NY), a supporter of
the NEA/NEH; Richard J. Franke, chairman of the John Nuveen Company and a
past chairman of the Illinois State Humanities Council; David McCullough;
Ken Burns; and Clay S. Jenkinson, "noted for his scholarly impersonations
of Thomas Jefferson at NEH sponsored Chautauquas" [!].

SENATE EDUCATION, ARTS AND HUMANITIES SUBCOM

[note: what follows is redacted from a National Campaign for Freedom
Expression summary of 23 February activity]

Among those who testified were:

*Christover Reeves, actor and President of the Creative Coalition, who
reportedly called for creating a "real endowment"  by setting aside a
portion of the NEA's budget over the next 7 years with the intention of
creating an endowment base that could be supplemented by private 2-to-1
matching funds.  Reeves argued that this timed phase-out of taxpayer
support would decrease the hostile "politicization" of cultural subsidies.
Harold Williams (president of the J. Paul Getty Trust) and others
testified that reaching the  $3-3.5 billion base necessary to generate
$167m annually was an unrealistic 7-year goal.

*Leonard Garment (lawyer, former advisor to Nixon, co-chair of the 1990
Independent Commission mandated by Congress to review the NEA) proposed
consolidation of the Endowments: one chair, a deputy for arts and one for
humanities, and a council appointed by various elected officials that would
include the President and Speaker of the House.  The restructured Endowment
would not grant individual artist grants,  Only institutions of "national
stature" would be directly supported, with block grants going to smaller
institutions.

*George White (NEA National Council Member and founder/president of the
Eugene O'Neill Theater Center) and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT and
subcom member) proposed to change copyright laws to supplement the
Endowments' budgets.  The proposal would permit the government to auction
literary and artistic works after their copyrights expire, with proceeds
routed to the NEA.

Note: We have heard White speak about this copyright idea but still don't
quite understand what he has in mind.  This NCFE account doesn't clarify
matters much.  An Associated Press report on the Subcomittee hearing
summarized White's position as follows:  "He proposed extending copyrights
on such things as plays and music, with revenue from the added royalties
going at least partially to support the NEA and its sister agency, the
National Endowment for the Humanities" (23 Feb).

Others who testified on 23 February included: Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr. of
Charleston, South Carolina; John D. Ong, BF Goodrich Company; Richard S.
Gurin, Binney and Smith Inc.; Dean Amhaus, Wisconsin Arts Board; Leonard
German, Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander and Ferdon, on behalf of the
Independent Commission on the Arts; Laurence Jarvik, Ctr for the Study of
Popular Culture; and Charles T. Clotfelter, Duke University.

DAY OF CAMPUS ACTION AGAINST CONTRACT ON AMERICA

Organized by the Center for Campus Organizing.  The stated objectives of
this day of action are: 1) to save student aid and increase funding for
education; 2) preserve pro-environmental regulations; 3) protect and extend
women's rights; 4) defend the rights of poor people and end poverty; 5)
prevent the scapegoating of immigrants; 6) resist the attacks on gays,
lesbians, and bisexuals.

And expand they should. But with the usual pendulum effect, things swish far
in one direction.  I find theory and discussion enriching at least, yet feel
concern about any climate that would seem to dictate that a writer who is
real, concerned, or whatever must become a full service provider of the range
of thought services.

Sometimes, when in the midst of discussion, I begin to want to find a poem.
 Perhaps simply a bout of longing that could be dismissed as discourageable
emotion or hunger for a different thing.

Subject:      Bob Filner & NEA $$
X-cc:         jrothenb@ucsd.edu

Bob Filner, the lone Democrat from the San Diego region, made a speech
on behalf of the NEA in Congress on Friday. Herewith, as reported in the
Congressional Record, is what he said:

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bateman). Under a previous order of the
House, the gentleman from California [Mr. Filner] is recognized for 5
minutes.

Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I rise today in support of
continued Federal funding for the National Endowment  for the Arts , the
National Endowment  for the Humanities, the Institute for Museum
Services and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. To be or not to be
civilized; that is the question, Mr. Speaker.

A civilized society must include art  and cultural enrichment, and it is
one of the responsibilities of government to support that aspect of our
civilization. We get what we pay for. We cannot rely solely on the good
will of a relatively few private individuals to fund the arts --it is
the duty of us all.

This Nation's investment in the arts  is one of the best we make. For
example, the approximately $2 million in Federal funding for the NEA,
NEH, and IMS that goes to my county in California, San Diego County, is
matched by nearly four times that amount in local contributions. This is
a perfect example of public-private partnership. The Government's
funding stimulates local giving to the arts  which in turn stimulates
local economies.

According to a recent study commissioned by the California Arts
Council, nonprofit art  organizations contribute some $2.1 billion
annually to California's economy, generate $77 million in tax revenue,
and create some 100,000 jobs. Yes, the arts  are important to the State
economy of California, and to other States as well. Business Week says
that Americans spent $340 billion on entertainment in 1993.

Critics tell us that the arts  are only for the elite. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Audiences and participants alike are people from
all walks of life. Nearly 40 million tickets were sold last year to
theater, music, and dance performances. Nielsen-rating figures show that
56.5 percent of households watching PBS programs earn less than $40,000
a year. And a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll showed that 76 percent of
respondents thought the Government should continue to fund public
broadcasting. Exposure to the arts  is especially important for our
children. If our young people can be motivated, thrilled, enriched, and
`turned on' by exciting experiences in theater, painting, pottery, or
dance, they will be less likely to `turn on' to drugs or gangs to fill
their empty hours and empty souls.

Barbra Streisand, in a speech at Harvard University earlier this month,
told how participation in the choral club at her Brooklyn high school
was the beginning of her career--and she urges more support for the arts
, not less. She asks how we can accept a country which has no
orchestras, choruses, libraries, or art  classes to nourish our
children. How many more talents like Barbra Streisand's are out there,
whom we will lose when there are no programs to challenge them?

In San Diego County, the San Diego Opera Company and the San Diego
Symphony provide opportunities for kids to attend the opera and symphony
concerts. The opera regularly goes out to schools with ensemble
performances.

San Diego's recipients of arts  funding range from elementary schools
and universities to KPBS public radio and TV to the Samahan Philippine
Dance Company and the Centro Cultural de la Raza to the Balboa Park
Museums and the Old Globe Theater, groups representing the entire
population of San Diego County. TheatreForum, and international theater
magazine published at UCSD; the renowned La Jolla Playhouse whose
productions go on to thrill audiences on Broadway and in the rest of the
country; an international festival at locations on both sides of the
border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico; graduate internships at
the Museum of Photographic Arts ; touring exhibitions from the Museum of
Contemporary Arts  in San Diego. I could go on and on. These and
hundreds of other art  forms are advanced by arts  funding in San Diego
County.

Even so, among all First World nations, the United States now spends the
least on Federal arts  support per citizen--and we are thinking of
reneging on that support. If we say no to culture, we will prove, in the
words of Los Angeles Philharmonic managing director Ernest Fleishmann,
that `we are the dumbest Nation on the planet.'

According to the General Accounting Office, the Department of Defense
plans to spend $9 billion over the next 7 years building nuclear attack
submarines that the Pentagon admits it does not need. That $9 billion
could sustain the Arts  and Humanities endowments  at current levels for
26 years. 26 years of National Public Radio, Big Bird, music and art
for kids--or superfluous subs for the Pentagon. Is this a difficult
choice?

If we defund the NEA, the NEH, the IMS and PBS, we will be telling the
world that we no longer take pride in our theaters, our educational
children's programs, our museums, our dance companies, our poets,
ourselves.

Ultimately, we are judged by the heritage we leave our children. I hope
we leave them more than soap operas and talk shows, attack submarines
and assault rifles, gangs and drugs!

Yes, Mr. Speaker, to be or not to be civilized; that is the question.

---------------------------------

Randy "Duke" Cunningham (as he's listed in all the House directories),
the GOP member who will chair the authorization subcommittee that will
consider the fate of the NEA, has the district next to Filner's. So
Filner can be a key allie. He & Cunningham may be mortal enemies, but he
ought to know how best to turn up the heat on him on this issue. Steve &
Jennifer, Jerry & Michael & Rae, take note & take action!

Dear James,

Please don't misread Sheila & Spencer's posts. Neither said *only* the
poem is a valid carrier of meaning. Closer would be: The poem is the
*primary* carrier of meaning. They're saying much more than that; you
might take another look. Reducing their concerns, which are fairly
complex, to anything equivalent to New Criticism is like dismissing the
concerns of the language movement (especially those who write in length
about the political value of the work) as those of WPA muralists. Your
conclusion above has a nice epigrammatical ring to it, but little more.

More on this later.

Yours,

Gary

Getting back to what was a topic at the begining of the po/theor
discussion, which was about whether every poem had a theory within or
behind it, whether poems embodied theory in some way . . .

I think that we are using the term theory loosely, that poetics or
philosophy may be what we sometimes mean, even though these are also used
more loosely than Aristotle might like. Simply "a body of thinking" might
suffice.

I certainly believe that Sheila Murphy & Spencer Selby's work, both of
which are supple in movement, fluid in their construction of patterns of
sound, and moving in their humanity (there's a loaded term, too), also
have, within and behind them, important bodies of thinking. If they value
the poems more than such theory or philosophy, that's fine -- I would
agree with them, while still in some ways wanting to unlock the thinking
to more fully inform, for me, the poems and the world. But I don't think
their greater interest in the poems devalues the theory in any way, so I'm not
certain if we really have an argument here. Either that, or my response to the
issue is relaxing as the time & messages pass by.

Regarding Spencer's frustration at the concentration on power games and
spheres of influence in the literary world, I would say that I recognize
such things and sometimes also decry them. I've been in situations where
I brought to a community I moved to an approach to poetry/poetics which
was not present, and helped to build a community of interest. I guess we
created a sphere of influence, and while I thought it was open to anyone,
I know and heard there was some resentment from people who felt they
weren't invited in. My thinking was that it was the nature of specific
concerns which provided the grounding for that sphere or community, and
anyone who wanted to think about those concerns, even if they had
disagreements, was invited in. But that wasn't always the perception.
I've also had the experience of bringing myself to a community, more
recently, because of a new job, in which I find almost no outlet for my
own concerns about poetry, and I don't feel welcomed by others. We all
have stories like this, I am sure. Still, within this sometimes
deplorable situation, be it local or international or something in
between, I've also managed to find true friends, cooperation, a sense of
commonality with many, so that I don't feel as negative about it all as
it seems that Spencer does. I don't think the manipulation of spheres of
influence is by any means the only story. There is some sustenance as well.

    Gary's (Sullivan's) defence of Spencer and Sheila's positions as
    something that need not (should not) be reduced to a simplistic caricature
    understanding of "New Criticism" is well-taken. How easy is it for
    so many to mouth an "anti-New Criticism" stance without really knowing
    what N.C. was---for if the L poets are not a monolith, neither is
    New Criticism, and so much of the conversation once again becomes a
    navigating of the alleged "minefield" of the connotations of various
    movements---be it "New Criticism," the "Pound-Williams line" or the
    "Apex G2ers"--and this all has the effect of "translating" consciousness
    (or culture, if you must) into something very "pinball" like...
    And yes we may well wonder whether the stars are conscious of the
    constellations we "put them in" and whether that consciousness can be
    seen as the REASON why they burn out (though of course we don't know
    they're burnt out yet), and there's probably some reason, some driving
    urge that should not be ignored, to PLACE OURSELVES, to orient ourselves,
    through the use of stickfigures. But to claim there's a definite
    anchor of certainty in such poetic schemas of culture is to not take
    seriously enough the potential power of reification and idolatry that
    can habituate identity to a point of barren solipsism. Otherwise,
    you can surely guess. Chris S.

there are currently 190 people subscribed to poetics; 2 of whom
are "consealed".  you can get the list by sending the message
"review poetics" to the listserv address <listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu>.

Subject:      Improving community relations in espace....

Auntie Netiquette says:

One of the easiest things posters can do to make things easier on their readers
is to send out posts with very clear subject lines.  Most systems allow
users to change or revise subject headers; it's worth learning how to do.
Outside policing or moderating isn't necessary if folks simply take the time
to label their contributions accurately.  For example, the following subject
headers are both specific and informative:

    CONFERENCE: First Annual Such-and-such meeting.

    CALL FOR PAPERS: New anthology of Lang Po

    NEA INFO: Latest Gingrich horror

    ANTI-HEGEMONY PROJECT: Poetics list takes toll...

Discussion thread headers like

    Boytalk

    E - speration and Communit - E

    Theory

are also really useful *if* people stick to the thread while using thread
headers.  It's a good idea to *change* the thread if you change the subject,
for example:

    "Tone" in Espace (was: Boytalk)

Clearly identifying subject lines allow those with limited time to delete
stuff they aren't interested in without taking the time to open the message
and without fear of missing something they *are* interested in.

My two cents,
Kali

I picked up the term on the VWAR-L, a list populated by many military
veterans as well as a certain percentage of wannabe veterans, fake vets, and
interested others.  It was the first place I ever heard it, though
everywhere I've used it, it's been picked up immediately because people like
it (I like it; that's why I use it).  My in-house military consultant
(business partner Steve Gomes, a Desert Storm-era vet) says it's a
faux-military term based on the notion of switching to an alternate
frequency, off the "command channel" or public frequency.  What makes it
useful, I think, is that it emphasizes that there are "lines" or "channels"
of communication in espace, different "frequencies" which are accessible to
different audiences.

 I just thought I'd put just my opinion of silliman
 He totally excites me and I am always looking forward to what
 he'll do next....no matter what he does I like.  Does
 anyone know if the Bay Area book awards will be broadcast on Pacifica and when?
 I predict he will give readings in the early fall of 2000.  I saw the
 Ear Inn show in New York City..It was increadible and unreal...
 I paid 85 bucks for my share of the dinner after...but it was worth it!
 WHAT came as a shock to me...I saw Toner in Sulfur and flipped out...I LOVE
 paradise ...and lit...and ABC
 and
 hell  the whole damn alphabet....It really bugs me when people put him
 down...they are just jealous and ignorant.....I'm looking forward
 to what he does next!

Subject:      Language Poetry

I would be interested to know if the following in any way serves to
describe Language Poetry, and, if not, what sort of poetry it might
seem to describe--

Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed
round for each one of us by that
thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever
pierced on its way to us, or from us
to that which we can only conjecture to be without. Every one of
those impressions is the
impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a
solitary prisoner its own dream
of a world . . . To such a tremulous wisp constantly reforming itself
on the stream, to a single
sharp impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting,
of such moments gone by, what is
real in our life fines itself down. It is with this movement, with
the passage and dissolution of
impressions, images, sensation, that analysis leaves off--that
continual vanishing away, that strange,
perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves.

        LOS ANGELES (AHP) -- In a story yesterday about a study examining
how shortages of inspired language and increasing population will affect
U.S. poetics production and Americans' diet of subsidized corn porn lyrics,
The Anti-Hegemony project erroneously reported the corporate affiliation
of a researcher.
        Marjorie Perloff is employed by Lang-Po Labs, not Arithmetrick
Frozen Yogurt Co. Down Under.

There's many a slip 'twixt the theory and the hip.

        I'm all in favor of keeping relevant discussions on the one list,
but speaking as someone who lives in the middle of the Pacific (though it
wouldn't matter where I lived), I'd love to see extended in-jokes put on
another list entirely.  I promise not to subscribe.

Where did all this excitement about flaming Silliman come from? It's
as if he were famous like Prince Charles instead of a poet doing his
job and beginning to get known outside the tight citcle. Give him and
us a break. He writes and he edits. He aint Prince Charles.
