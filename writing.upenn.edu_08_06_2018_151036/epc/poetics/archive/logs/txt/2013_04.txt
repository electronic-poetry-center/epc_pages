A historic Bengali poetry publication in Jacket2
by Aryanil Mukherjee <https://www.facebook.com/aryanil.mukherjee>
(Notes<https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1742271370&sk=notes>)
on Monday, May 21, 2012 at
6:47pm**<https://www.facebook.com/notes/aryanil-mukherjee/a-historic-bengali-poetry-publication-in-jacket2/10150843238708457#>

Almost, 50 years back, in 1964, Allen Ginsberg brought back some
avant-garde writings of contemporary Bengali poets of the Krittibaas and
Hungry Generation groups from Calcutta. Allen helped Lawrence Ferlinghetti
do a special issue on Bengali poetry in the City Lights magazine.



(as it turned out during our correspondance re The Hungry Poets, Ginsberg's
time in India and Aryanil's long truly fascinating, labyrinthine &
mesmerizing recounting the inside history of these people, places,events,
cross influences & noninfluences, complications etc through the years-- i
had this special issue and xeroxed and sent copiesof the poetry & AG's
notes to Aryanil--a kind of magical synchronicity of the moment--d-bc)

http://jacket2.org/feature/adaptations-bengali-poetry/

A similar but more extensive portfolio of Bengali poetry was released today
in Jacket2 (linked above). The work published is largely an English
translation of poetry and essays coming from a young group of experimental
Bengali writers. Since the dawn of the new millennium, they began writing,
quite unconsciously, I think, a newer kind of avant-garde Bengali poetry
that is perhaps more multi-epistemological than ever before. As its traits
began to gel by the end of the first decade, this group, where I proudly
belong, felt a pressing need to identify and formalize their collective
poetics. They called it "Paribishhayee Kabitaa" or Circumcontentive Poetry.
A Circumcontentive Poetry Movement issue came out in the Kaurab magazine in
Jan, 2011. We also run a low-profile blog -
http://circumcontentivepoetry.blogspot.com where we print our new work for
group discussion.

While we welcome this historic publication with great delight, I, on
behalf, of this small group of writers, express our deepest gratitude to a
few. First to the feature editor Sarah Dowling, for firstly soliciting the
work and spending painstaking hours editing the bizarre quasi-scientific
poetics of our crazy English tongue, trying to normalize it for her "6-pack
Jacket Joes". Sarah, it was a joy to work with you! Secondly, I/we remain
profoundly indebted to Jacket2 editor Michael Hennessey for so many reasons
that cannot be listed here. The comfort of working with Mike has been
unprecedented.

This section could not have been done without the direct support of Pat
Clifford and the constant encouragement we receive from Charles Bernstein
and Al Fileris. Bengalis are generally worse than New Yorkers when it comes
to thanking and I am trying so hard to disprove that.

Urging you all to read it and share. & yes, slowly please.

Dear Friends=0A=0ARattapallax just released the magazine as an app. We thin=
k its ground-breaking and radically different than any other literary magaz=
ine. What makes this unique is that it is a self-contained app, and not a r=
eproduction of the "print" journal on a tablet. Most publications send a PD=
F file of their print journal to a third party app that "displays" it in th=
eir interface. Rather, our magazine was designed from the ground-up for the=
 iPad by Stoycode. There is no version of it in print or online.=0A=0AIt wa=
s conceived and designed for the iPad. Sorry, only the iPad. Maybe in the f=

Universities.
=20
It will consider the scope and applicability of the ideas of Pierre =
Joris and Allen Fisher and related poetics, including issues of =
translation and place-specific writing, in the light of the archipelagic =
World-and-UK context of the many =E2=80=98devolved voices=E2=80=99 of =
contemporary poetry.



A nomadic poetics is =E2=80=A6 always changing, morphing, moving through =
languages, cultures, terrains, times without stopping. Refuelling halts =
are called poases, they last a night or a day, the time of a poem, & =
then move on. A nomadic poetics needs mindfulness in & of the drift =
(d=C3=A9rive) =E2=80=93 there is no at-homeness here, but only an ever =
more displaced drifting. For the language to be accurate to the =
condition of nomadicity, it too has to be drifting, to be always =E2=80=98=
on the way=E2=80=99, as Celan puts it.=E2=80=A8

Pierre Joris, Notes Towards a Nomadic Poetics.



The new works . . . include objects and processes, process-showings and =
methodologies in a world of multiple possibilities that is . . . =
complementing the political arena, without being its voice. . . . It is =
a requirement of this art that . . . the poetry is always =E2=80=98yet =
to be found=E2=80=99 in the process of its making, and that making =
continues to take place through the physiology of the reader.=E2=80=A8

Allen Fisher, The Topological Shovel, Four Essays.



Confirmed contributors include Pierre Joris, Allen Fisher, Jean =
Portante, Mandy Bloomfield, Ian Davidson, Steven Hitchins, Peter Barry =
and Zo=C3=AB Skoulding.



Suggestions for further fifteen-minute talks/papers (followed by =
discussion) are invited on any aspect of the work and/or cultural =
contexts of Pierre Joris and/or Allen Fisher. Please send a 200-word =
outline of your proposed topic by April 15th 2013. Those who wish to =
contribute to discussion without presenting a paper are also welcome, =
but please confirm attendance by the same date if you plan to come. Fee: =
=C2=A330 waged or =C2=A320 student/unwaged.



A reading featuring Allen Fisher, Pierre Joris, Nicole Peyrafitte and =
Jean Portante will take place before the symposium at 6.30pm on the =
Friday evening, May 17th.=E2=80=A8 All events will be held in Bangor =
University.

After readings in Vancouver, Montreal, Detroit, Columbus, Cobourg, and
Lafayette to celebrate the publication of LOOMS, I'm bringin' it home to
Toronto at the ART BAR on Thursday, April 9.

My co-readers:
Adam Seelig <https://www.facebook.com/adam.seelig.3?group_id=0> (EVERY DAY
IN THE MORNING (SLOW))
Jim Johnstone <https://www.facebook.com/jim.johnstone.39?group_id=0>(PATTERNICITY)!

If you're in Toronto on that date, Jim, Adam, and I would love to see you!

CAMILLE MARTIN is the author of Looms (2012), Sonnets (2010), Codes of
Public Sleep (2007), and Sesame Kiosk ( 2001). She has performed her poetry
in more than thirty cities in Canada, the United States, Ireland, the
United Kingdom, and France. Rob McLennan praises Looms for the
"fearlessness that permeates the entire work." Steve Spence for Stride
Magazine writes of its "painterly, noir feel, alienated and penumbral, taut
yet expansive. Impressive and addictive." And Cort Bledsoe for Bookslut
states that "Martin has woven a rich tapestry of poems that are well worth
perusing." Martin's Art Bar reading marks the debut of Looms in Toronto.

JIM JOHNSTONE is the author of 3 books of poetry, including Patternicity
(Nightwood Editions, 2010). His latest chapbook, Epoch, is forthcoming from
Frog Hollow Press in 2013. He's a former winner of the CBC Poetry Prize,
Matrix Magazine's Lit-Pop Award and The Fiddlehead's Ralph Gustafson Poetry
Prize.

ADAM SEELIG is a poet, playwright, and stage director living in Toronto,
where he is the Artistic Director of One Little Goat Theatre Company. His
plays include All Is Almost Still (78th Street Theatre Lab, New York 2004),
Antigone: Insurgency (Walmer Centre Theatre, Toronto 2007), and Talking
Masks (BookThug, 2009).

A NEW KIND OF WORKSHOP -- =93ON THE
ROAD=94




Sacred Sites and the Creative Word is offering a new kind of workshop.  It
invites writers to enroll in its new and building workshop series, one that
takes small groups of poets & writers =93on the road=94 to investigate
archeologically significant and/or spiritually historical sites while
experimenting with the writing process.  =93Global hotspots=94 (metaphorica=
lly
speaking) will provide a base for a collaborative creative experiment.
Intellectually based but also inspired by the spiritual history, energies,
and aesthetic beauty of each site, the traveling workshop will also allow
time for the actual writing  (you will work on paper, in journals, on
laptops or Ipads).   These traveling workshops will also build time in for
discussions with the other writers.  Visual and new-media artists may also
apply for the workshops we are now scheduling.  Hybrid artistic
collaborations are most encouraged.



Writing =93on the road=94 will encourage momentum for writers towards their
work -- and insist upon movement within the writing itself.  The trips we
will do to such sites (France, Egypt, Peru are being scheduled) will
inspire those with interests in ancient spirituality and shamanism, the
feminine divine and alternative spiritual practices, and the intellectual
history of religion and art.  Accommodations will be comfortable but not
pricey, and are fully included along with ground transport.



Laura Hinton, Ph.D., Professor of English at the City College of New York
(CUNY), author most recently of the poetry book *Sisyphus My Love* in
addition to critical books and essays on feminist theory in literature and
art, will lead the first workshop scheduled for *July 11-23, 2013, =93The
Sacred Feminine in the South of France:  Virgin, Magdalene, and Black
Madonnas.=94  *She has 15 years experience traveling and studying this
terrain.  Workshop space is limited.  See the website for full
trip-workshop information details and registration, now open for this
journey.  And keep watching for more schedules to come:

Subject:      prairie fire review of books

    is apparently suspending publication, citing financial reasons;

    http://ojs.lib.umanitoba.ca/prairie_fire

    i find this enormously troubling, considering how few reviews there
    already are in canadian literature for small press poetry and fiction;

    i wonder, if everyone wrote as many worthy reviews for as many books
    and/or chapbooks they produced, would we even be in this situation?

    if we aren't willing to talk about what we've already produced, if we
    aren't willing to understand the work that has already been done, is there
    any point in producing any more?

    etc;

Dear Friends,

After memorable launch last year, North America's first Jewish Poetry
retreat is back again! I'm honored to be co-hosting it with poet Adeena
Karasick. The retreat is part of the (very hip) KlezKanada festival, held
in Laurentian Mountains Aug 19-25.

The week-long fest is big and very much cross-genre and so in addition to
the actual daily writing sessions there will be great opportunities for
collaborations with musicians, dancers, theater and visual art folks -
who'll all be there alongside us. Canadian Laurentians are gorgeous -
mountains, forest, lake are all right there- and there's going to be A LOT
of great music all the time.

Please spread the word among fellow poets/friends/students etc.!

Some scholarships available for folks under 35! Applications are due by *Ma=
y
1st* here's the link to application: http://klezkanada.org/scholarships/.

Information about the KlezKan retreat is here:
http://klezkanada.org/poetry-retreat/ and below's the blurb:

Poetry=92s greatest moments have often been measured by its proximity to
music. And so, Klezkanada  =96 legendary festival of Jewish music and cultu=
re
=96 is inviting poets world-wide to join the festivities at a week-long
writing retreat. Two daily workshop sessions will explore the poetic
tradition and anti-tradition across the three millennia of Jewish
discourse, with a special focus on the avant-garde and otherwise
contemporary work. We=92ll look at ritualistic poetry, mighty Jewish
vernaculars, ecstatic tradition of poetry-prophecy; Talmud and its
dialectic-all-yelling-at-once heritage; practice of Found Poetry and
Uncreative Writing; Kabbalistic language experiments; Jazz/Klezmer inspired
poetry =96 and so much more.  There will be one-on-one time with the facult=
y
and encounters with internationally celebrated poets, musicians, artists,
and academics. Poets will be encouraged to draw inspiration from the
numerous concerts, and to collaborate with musicians, dancers, painters and
other participating artists, to attend lectures, Yiddish classes, sing,
dance, celebrate. Held in the beautiful mountain settings in the heart of
the Canadian Laurentians.

Spread the word!!

-Jake Marmer

About Remote Encounters from Garrett Lynch:

Remote Encounters: Connecting bodies, collapsing spaces and temporal
ubiquity in networked performance

keywords: performance, networked, body, space, place, time, real,
virtual

:: Description ::

Since the internet entered the public domain in the early 90's
there has been an explosion in artistic interest in its use as a
means, site and context for creative practice.  Much of this
practice is performative in nature; ether originating from a
performance background and using the internet as a new site and/or
augmenting aspect of that practice or is a form of practice
developed as direct response to the internet and becomes
performative to some degree in its spectatorship.

It has been well established that the internet is not the first or
only example of the use of a networked technology repurposed for
creative practice.  There is a clear time line that can be traced
back through the practice of Roy Ascott and his coining of the
term Telematic Art in the 1980's to artist's use of satellite
networks, telephone and other telecommunication devices as each
were invented.  Seen in this respect the internet can be
considered as one of many networked technologies that has enabled
networked performance.

The internet is unique however in that it is not a singular
network type that favours a particular form of media, broadcast or
spectatorship.  Most famously known as the network of networks it
enables multiple protocols of which the world wide web's http is
just one, is multimedia in nature and encourages intertextual
folding and layering of media, is multi-directional not simply a
broadcast communication form, de-centralised in ownership and the
majority of its technologies are openly accessible.

Remote Encounters, a two-day international conference with
performance evening, aims to explore the use of networks as a
means to enhance or create a wide variety of performance arts.
How do networks as a site for performance provide opportunities
for us as artists and performers?  In particular how can we
remotely collaborate, merge geographically separate places and
times, reconfigure the space of performance and the relationship
between artist and audience?

_______________________________________________


Our proposal in brief:

Pain dance / performance in OpenSim with Sandy Baldwin: textual
materials would be presented in the form of chat and sound-over/
voice-over. We would be working with distorted avatars and
modeling from tissues, etc. [We'll perform in Second Life.] The
text would deal with issues of death, sex, and pain in virtual
worlds.

the luminosity of objects, art, and one another. That every shadow of

Hi all,

Boog City would like to invite you to exhibit at our 10th annual =20
small, small press fair (with indie records and crafts, too).

The fair will once again span two days, Sat. Aug. 3-Sun. Aug. 4, and =20
be held at Brooklyn=92s Unnameable Books (600 Vanderbilt Ave.) in their =20=

spacious backyard. The fair will take place during the 7th annual =20
Welcome to Boog City poetry, music, and theater festival.

The fair will open on Saturday with performances by authors from each =20=

of the tabling presses.

Tables are $30 for the fair, $20 dollars if you bring your own bridge =20=

table (up to 3=92 x 3=92). All tabling presses will also receive a =20
complimentary online business card size ad (H-2" x W-3.5") in the =20
festival program issue of Boog City.

When you email me to reserve your table and schedule your reader =20
here's what I'll need:

=97a bio, logo, and url for the press

=97a bio, color foto, and url for your press' reader. (Each press will =20=

have 10 minutes total for a reader and, perhaps, to talk about their =20
press.) Though most poets (myself included) don't have their own =20
websites, I'm guessing your poet might have work, or perhaps even an =20
interview with them, online. If so, if you can please send one of =20
those urls.

Please email all of the information and images to me on or by Fri. May =20=

31, and make payment via paypal to editor@boogcity.com.

This year=92s fair will feature readings, musical performances, short =20=

political talks, our new BoogWork poetry workshop and reading series, =20=

and our annual panel.

We look forward to the fair once again being a warm gathering with =20
wonderful books, poetry, music, and other items from around our =20
creative community.

as ever,
David

P.S. Apologies if you received more than one copy of this email.

Hello beautiful people,

It is with enthusiasm, excitement, and something akin to pleasure that I
announce the new Unlikely Stories: Episode IV Political Editor -- Willis
Gordon. Willis is a columnist at Drunken Absurdity, the author of three
books, and a veteran of the current war in Afghanistan. Check out his
opening comments at http://www.unlikelystories.org/13/gordon0413.shtml .

It is with substantially more ambivalence that I announce a permanent
change in the publishing schedule of Unlikely Stories: Episode IV. Learn
about how we do things at
http://www.unlikelystories.org/13/penton0413.shtml , and maybe send us
some creative or sociopolitical work -- learn about our standards and
approach at http://www.unlikelystories.org/mission.shtml .

It's not your fault,
--

The Second Revised  Edition 2013 by Mirela Roznoveanu (translations) and
Alexandra Conte (illustrations) came up. You can have a preview here:
http://www.scribd.com/doc/130045555/OLD-ROMANIAN-FAIRY-TALES

Published by Xlibris
http://bookstore.xlibris.com/Products/SKU-0111911017/OLD-ROMANIAN-FAIRY-TALES.aspx

The present book of English translations captures and conveys great
narratives of the Romanian folklore.  Old Romanian Fairy Tales captures the
imagination, conveys important lessons about morality and responsibility,
and strikes a chord of deep patterns on which our civilization was built.
Readers will encounter fabulous fairies, Prince Charming, witness battles
with dragons, betrayal, competition, and love. The book has beautiful
imaginative color illustrations. To add more to the uniqueness of this
book: these fairy tales were never translated before into the English
language.

*2 WEEKS - ONLY 2 SEATS REMAINING!*

*WEEK #1, WE START WITH DEATH - *

Making Matter Move: Philosophy and Physics in Poetry

As we consider major philosophical subjects in our work, we will also look
to the seemingly separate realm of physics for challenge and material.
Though philosophers traditionally tend to work in ideas, poets go the next
step, integrating intellectual considerations with tangible aspects of the
ephemeral and the carnal - with matter itself. Poetry allows us to broaden
knowledge, bridge schools of thought and access new inroads for processing
the world, rooted in our potential to imagine and conceive.

Each week we will focus on one major philosophical topic such as Life,
Love, War, and Death by crafting poems that approach related issues and by
employing the poet's intuitive senses as well as the intellect. We'll
employ poetry as permission and a means to not only be moved, but to move
the matter of world and words. A medley of poems will stimulate us by Anne
Carson, Paul Celan, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens, Wis=C5=82awa Szymbors=
ka &
many more.

by Amy King

Try again. Embroider the earth=E2=80=99s arc of belly rising
to fold into mountain. If you lay your head table-side,
a stream trickles out, over rocks, into lunar heights.
Right here beside you. The sheen of a screen replays
distant ringing from a lime green phone, 1950.
It is your mother before she became.
Then a school girl in college clothing.
The floor tiles buckle with sprouting weeds we seeded
with sleep. We stood in the room=E2=80=99s disintegration,
matter apart=E2=80=94shapeless scenes apiece, looking for form.
Mockingbird nests in the paisley fabric
our scientists embroider with wormholes, ideas
melting with the walls into hair. We are all
separate flesh, sleeker atoms to become parallel people.
We blend with the desks before us, our writing utensils
tuning to forks with fingers, words turning out pupils
of stars on the hunt for dark matter.
Keyboards and dust sponge like doorknobs.
Wood grains in floors become paintings of carpet fibers,
dust mites and personal. We part like walls with zippers
over eyelids to pass through portals called doors.
They smile when we reach with our minds
to turn handles, yielding keyboards from the piano next door.
No navel in the previous mountain sheds
its boney clothes before us. We are as equal
as the ghost birds holy forever scarred songs, aloud ahead.

Subject:      Cosima Bruno on translation as a mode of reading poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"

I'd like to draw your attention to a book published by Cosima Bruno and des=
cribed below, entitled Between the Lines: Yang Lian=92s Poetry through Tran=
slation. Bruno's book makes a case for studying translations as a method of=
 reading poetry. I'm mentioning the book here because I think it may be of =
interest to list members but may not otherwise enter into conversations wit=
hin English-language poetry=96=96since it focuses on the work of Chinese po=
et Yang Lian (about whom, incidentally, I've also written in A Common Stran=
geness and elsewhere).


Between the Lines: Yang Lian's Poetry through Translation

Between the Lines: Yang Lian=92s Poetry through Translation is a book conce=
rned with variants of the epistemological act: reading, translating, writin=
g. It investigates two broad theoretical and methodological questions that =
are crucial in cultural, translation and literary studies alike: the issue =
of interpretation and representation, and the need for a non-dichotomous ap=
proach to the study of literature and literary translation. The author, Cos=
ima Bruno, engages with these questions by synthesizing and revising hermen=
eutical approaches and by providing new methodological tools for a textual =
exegesis of Yang Lian=92s poetry =96 one of the most critically acclaimed c=
ontemporary work. The publication of this book thus marks a shift in the st=
udy of poetry translation, too often based on evaluative and contrastive an=
alysis between two (typically western) language pairs.

You can also listen to Bruno talking about her book here: http://newbooksin=
eastasianstudies.com/2012/11/26/cosima-bruno-between-the-lines-yang-lians-p=
oetry-through-translation-brill-2012.

About VERTIGO DIARY:
Larry=92s poetry gives me the best kind of vertigo: the kind where =
you=92re afraid of falling, but when you do you fall into a soft, meaty, =
sensual, smart ravine that shakes you pretty good, but instead of =
killing you it turns you into a Thinking Cocktail. What a scary and fine =
artist Mr. Sawyer is!

=97Andrei Codrescu


Larry Sawyer=92s Vertigo Diary speaks from a three-fold poetics of =
self-consciousness, critique and humor so that we chuckle at and choke =
on our collective shortcomings. This book contains so many thrilling =
moments of high altitude lyricism that are skillfully balanced by an =
urbane desire to =93progress beyond the / Need to fill our silences with =
such idiot carcasses.=94 In the end, Sawyer=92s woozy and exquisite =
poems are shadow messages from the other side of ourselves, messages =
that unshackle language and let it loose in a dynamic field of play. =
When I hear these messages, I feel a rare sense of freedom; that is, =93To=
 their telegrams I respond / with a ponderous liberty.=94

=97Nathan Hoks


The secret love-child of Frank O'Hara and Paul =C9luard, Vertigo Diary =
is a swirling romp into the city=97through the mundane to the Pentagon =
to the not-so-probable. Sawyer's latest maps a world filled with beauty =
and longing, where the political, pop culture, and literary history meet =
in =93our own private Pompeii.=94

=97Megan Kaminski


Larry Sawyer=92s Vertigo Diary is a fine 21st century example of the =
poetry of the American Urban Sublime. More Ben Katchor=92s Julius Knipl =
than Nelson Algren=92s Frankie Machine, the author serves up a =93moment =
salad=94 of incidentals in our day world and his sharp ear gets the real =
news down sans air quotes. Humane and wry, the book reads like the =
serial composition playing in my head=97you just can=92t tell what is =
awaiting you past the next period, comma or enjambment. Dialectic bebop.

=97Joel Lewis


In Vertigo Diary, Larry Sawyer gives us poems that are rich in =
idiosyncratic imagery and elusive, quotable metaphor (=93Why was each =
moment such a miniature Troy?=94). Sawyer=92s exuberant sensibility has =
led him to confident lyric expression whose finest moments are beyond =
context.

Larry Sawyer has curated the Myopic Books Poetry Reading Series since =
2005. With Lina ramona Vitkauskas he also edits milk magazine. Sawyer is =
also the co-director of The Chicago School of Poetics. His poetry and =

RISE IN THE FALL. By Ana Bo=BEi=E8evi=E6, images by Bianca Stone.

Ana Bo=BEi=E8evi=E6 is both a poet's poet and the people's poet. Rise in th=
e
Fall, her second full-length collection, is a revolutionary book and an *ar=
s
poetica* for the polis in which she excludes nothing - even nothing.
Navigating literary history, gender, sexuality, economics, family, friends
and lovers, she is at ease deploying and subverting the universal political
statement and the lyric "I".


A Croatian =E9migr=E9, Bo=BEi=E8evi=E6 approaches the English language with=
 a playful
objectivity, bouncing back and forth from the conversational to the grand:
"This is the whitest shit / I've ever written" she notes in her half-myth
"About Nietzsche." Her critique of our time and place is at once empathetic
and crude, tender and grotesque. Lucky for us, "beauty [wins] in all its
casual terror and pain."

*Begging for It**by Alex Dimitrov**

Alex Dimitrov leads us through the streets, bridges, and bedrooms of New
York City, sometimes as far away as Buenos Aires and Iceland, and as close
as our own darkest corners. A Bulgarian immigrant, Dimitrov writes as both
observer of and fervent participant in an "American youth," as his speakers
navigate both the physical and emotional landscapes of desire, intimacy,
and longing--whether for a friend, a lover, or a self, "Saint or stranger, =
I
still recklessly seek you."



"Alex Dimitrov's passionate, headlong poems seem to want to carve beneath
the surface of gestures, beneath the skin, to the warm and dangerous blood
beneath--until sex, and the poem itself, are 'a nerve brightly turning in a
closed room of the mind--.'...Begging for It is a fierce and memorable debu=
t."
--Mark Doty

LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs*

**

*TWERK unveils an identity shaped by popular media and history, code
switching and cultural inclusivity. The poems, songs, and myths in this
long-awaited first book are as rooted in lyric as in innovation, in Black
music as in macaronic satire. TWERK evokes paradox, humor, and
vulnerability, and it offers myriad avenues fueled by language, idiom, and
vernacular. This book asks only that we imagine America as it has always
existed, an Americana beyond the English language.
*

*Tweaking parallel languages, rebooting and putting them to (hard, hard)
work, TwERK's non-stop shimmy-shimmy embarks on an anim=E9-iigjag
idio-lingual-lectical booty-roll and doesn't come down until the break of
dawn. La Reina de Harlem responds to Lorca's Big-Apple-opolis heteroglossia
with her own inimitable animations, incantations and ululations, twisting
tongues so mellifluously that you don't even realize you've been dancing on
Saturn with Sun Ra for hours and still could have begged for more. Welcome
LaTasha Diggs: this is her many-splendored night out!*

PROXY is an unrequited love story in prose poems, where the landscape of
the beloved body becomes the windows of New York City, the deserts of North
Africa, and the mangroves of the Caribbean. PROXY is a conversation with
the calculus, plotting and space against the infinite  capacities of desire=
.

Gina Myers, Hold It Down

"Gina Myers' aptly-named Hold It Down chronicles the endless effort to keep
a lid on hope, that feathered thing that must be denied so the rent can be
paid. Everything else Pandora's box let loose has hung around--boredom,
sickness, loneliness--but if hope gets out, it gets away. Moving among
Brooklyn, Saginaw, and Atlanta, with a soundtrack looping Otis Redding and
Johnny Cash, these poems forgo hipster irony for genuine dismay with
consumerism, war, and others of the world's ills. Myers' lines break like
hearts. Let her speak plainly to you: "This is my life, / this is my
life."--Evie
Shockley
