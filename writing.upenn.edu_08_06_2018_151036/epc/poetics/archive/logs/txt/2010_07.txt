Subject:      Todd Swift on Poetry and Politics: new essay from AngelHousePress
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

In his essay, "A Broadcast from Cairo: Poetry, Politics and the
Extraordinary Pressure of News" Todd Swift muses on the compatibility
of poetry and politics. The essay is particularly timely given the
recent oil spill in the Gulf and the ensuing poetic engagement, and
also the recent G20 riots in Toronto and the participation of writers
as activists and protestors. How does art or how can art respond to
war, unrest and disaster or should art respond at all?

*A Marzipan Factory *is the most original and enticing book of poems I have
read in years. It is Kafkaesque and yet tender, cynical and yet warm,
elliptical and yet wholly immediate. Grzegorz Wr=F3blewski can take the mos=
t
ordinary of phenomena and then give them the twist of a knife: to "spare"
the life of a living organism=97a "dry" tangerine for instance=97is, from
another angle, to forget it.   The pleasures and terrors of sex, of age, of
the fear of death, of the deceptions of our social life, have rarely been s=
o
brutally=97yet wittily and charmingly=97documented as they are in these sho=
rt,
often gnomic poems, surprisingly well rendered in Adam Zdrodowski=92s
translation. Grzegorz Wr=F3blewski restores one=92s faith in the power of l=
yric
poetry to renew itself. =97 Marjorie Perloff



Grzegorz Wr=F3blewski's poems are ironic and serious, quick and probing,
nailed to place and character but soaring in imagination.  If you haven't
read his poems, it's not too late to start and this new volume is the
perfect place to do that. =97 John Z. Guzlowski



*A Marzipan Factory* will also be available through Amazon shortly.

Ginserg's Fall of America and kerouc's posthumous Scattered Poems came out
(i think also Poems all Sizes might have been in 1971)

I remember quite vividly reading both of those that summer--(Scattered Poems
& Fall of America)--


Ted Berrigan published  in 1971 A Train Ride and Memorial Day (with Anne
Waldman)--i read those in '71 as a friend in NYC who worked in a bookstore
gave them to me as "part of my new york experience"

i also read Frank O'Hara for the first time--Lunch Poems and Meditations in
an Emergency--i had found both at a yard sale--

other poets i remember reading that year though the spefic works not
published in 1971
(in a way a book when one reads it is "new, of that year" when one first
reads it--)

     [image: Because Freedom Can't Protect

Dear ACLU Supporter,

   <http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3DHTpVXEF3sxhrgqG9swNqIw..>

The books, music and movies you browse or buy online can reveal private and
profoundly intimate information about your life. It's time to upgrade the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act to keep our personal information safe=
.

 <http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3Dujt2wkSoR6eU1TGFTUPEcg..>
  Can government agencies conduct sweeping collections of your most persona=
l
and private information, including the books you buy online?

That fundamental question is at stake in an ACLU lawsuit we just filed. The
ACLU intervened in an existing Amazon.com lawsuit to resist the North
Carolina Department of Revenue's demand that Amazon turn over thousands of
customers' records.

The laws governing electronic privacy haven't been updated since 1986=97bef=
ore
the Internet as we know it even existed. The books, music and movies you
browse or buy online can reveal private and profoundly intimate information
about your life. It's time to upgrade the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act (ECPA) to keep our personal information safe.

*Tell Congress to update our privacy laws and keep your information
personal, private and
protected.*<http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3Dh72slccOMiF6Rnqf38ItjQ..>

Our anonymous clients in the Amazon.com lawsuit include:

   - Jane Doe 1, who purchased books on self-help and how to get a divorce
   and a restraining order after her former spouse threatened to kill her.
   - Jane Doe 2, the general counsel of a global corporation, who purchased
   books and movies with overt political leanings as well as books that may
   reveal her religious beliefs.
   - Jane Doe 3, who purchased books on mental health in order to better
   understand the conditions afflicting her former spouse, including "Stop
   Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About =
Has
   Borderline Personality Disorder."

If the North Carolina government gets its way, this information=97and the
personal records of thousands of others=97will be in government hands. We'v=
e
gone to court to stop this massive invasion of privacy and free speech
rights. But we must stop it from happening in the future.

*Tell Congress to strengthen personal privacy laws to prevent unreasonable
government demands for our most personal electronic
information.*<http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3DrRsrSTTtXzLg26GjG9-hTA..>

Amazon has refused to yield to the unreasonable demands for detailed
information about what specific individuals are buying online. As part of a
tax audit, it has already handed over lists of the exact items purchased an=
d
their cost. But North Carolina has refused to relent in its belief that it
is also entitled to know the identities of purchasers.

It shouldn't take either Amazon standing tall or the ACLU intervening to
prevent this kind of abuse. We should have clear laws that safeguard our
private records, especially when they involve expressive materials like
books.

*Tell your members of Congress it's time to update and strengthen privacy
laws.* <http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3DUdXJrERIwchST1Ky2UnkrA..>

Thank you for taking action on this vitally important effort to defend
personal privacy.

Subject: BP is burning endangered sea turtles alive

Click here to sign the petition:
"BP: Stop blocking the rescue of endangered sea turtles before you burn them
                      alive in your 'controlled burns.'"

               [button_red_signpetition.gif] Sign the petition

Dear MoveOn member,

News recently emerged from the Gulf Coast that BP is burning endangered sea
turtles alive.1

That's right. BP is using "controlled burns" to contain the oil spill, and
any turtles that are not removed from the area before the fire is lit are
literally burned alive.

A boat captain who has been leading efforts to rescue the endangered turtles
says BP has blocked his crews from entering the areas where the animals are
trapped, effectively shutting down the rescue operation.

With BP already facing so much public outrage, we can stop this. Our friends
at Credo Mobile launched a petition demanding that BP stop burning turtles
alive, and you can add your name by clicking the link below:Â 

http://pol.moveon.org/seaturtles/?id=21503-1083850-pJvqBmx&t=5

The petition says: "BP: Stop blocking the rescue of endangered sea turtles
before you burn them alive in your 'controlled burns.'"

Then, after you've signed, be sure to share it with your friends on
Facebook, Twitter, or by forwarding this email.

The way controlled burns work is that shrimp boats create a corral of oil by
dragging together fire-resistant booms and then lighting the enclosed "burn
box" on fire. Any animals not removed from the burn area are trapped.Â 

The sea turtle most affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is the Kemp's
Ridley, which is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.2

"They ran us out of there and then they shut us down. They would not let us
get back in there," said turtle rescuer Mike Ellis in an interview with
conservation biologist Catherine Craig that was posted on YouTube.3

Environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and
Turtle Island Restoration Network have called on BP to end the practice, but
BP has refused, denying that there's really any problem. Yesterday, these
groups filed a lawsuit demanding that BP take action to protect the
endangered turtles.4 But the legal system can work very slowly, and the
turtles need help now.

Tell BP to allow the rescue boats back in and stop burning endangered sea
turtles alive. Click the link below to sign the petition:

Bill Knott, in his comment on Sharon Messmer's poem, PIMP MY TOP KILL
LIVE FEED MOTHERSHIP at POETS FOR LIVING WATERS, writes the following:

Karl Marx said to Heinrich Heine: =93Give up these everlasting
complaints about love; show these poets how to use a whip.=94 What makes
the Mesmer poem stand out from the others here is the whip of it.

Apparently, the poet John Logan also used it in his opening to A
CENTURY PIECE FOR POOR HEINE.

Does anyone know if Marx actually wrote this to Heinrich Heine?

Nearly sixty years ago, Charles Olson warned, =93The poet cannot afford to
traffick in any other sign than his =91one=92,=94 preparing the way whether=
 he
knew it or not for M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny to take leave of his native Hungarian=
 and
to move into English, where for more than two decades he has been creating
traffic signs with the gleeful abandon of a deranged city planner with an
advanced degree in Dada. Or maybe not so deranged. I read the poems in *
modulations* as perfectly sensible, whether fish are emitting thought
bubbles in the sky, or a table=92s legs are deconstructed to show their
essentially asemic nature. Language is our great connecting principle and
Kopp=E1ny=92s language artfully breaks, reduces, and repairs poetry with a
metaphysician=92s discomfort matched with a physician=92s healing touch. =
=97*Peter
O'Leary*



There was a time when *pictures* and *writing* were not as separate as they
are today, a time when *the picture* was given not just *to show* but *to
tell;* a sort of =93picture-writing.=94  And each =93pictograph=94 was as a=
n aper=E7u,
at once an insight into and a brief digest of the thought to be
communicated.  The poet M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny has found for himself a form mos=
t
becoming of his intuition; each panel here is an aper=E7u into that space
where *picture* and *writing* are one, *that space where the mind knows the
word in the figure of its substance,* that space that is *language-in-eidos=
.
*  And so I see Kopp=E1ny=92s panels as =93eidographs,=94 as urtexts of =93=
eidetic
poetry.=94  =97*Gregory Vincent St. Thomasino, author of The Logoclasody
Manifesto  *



What can you say about . . . except that  . . . with clouds just

where they . . . which is, to say, in short, a master of the . . .,

as well as . . . the.  For instance, the refle . . .  one poem

of the invis. . .  stillness (             ), not to exclude (



                                                                   In
fullest slowest color. =97*Bob Gru . . . n*

* *

The minimalist visual poetry of M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny has many qualities lifti=
ng it
high and above most visual poetry composed over the last 100 years in any
language. We are fortunate he has chosen to compose in his second language,
American English, wedded to discipline. His manifestations always lean
forward into the new, not a mere recycling of the old and worn out. It
brings smiles, smirks and the belly laugh. It is consistently permeated wit=
h
the rare characteristic of awe so many others lack and never reach for. And=
,
for me, on too many occasions, his visions give me a jealous wish that it
had come my way rather than his. =97*Karl Kempton*

About Albert Ayler
(July 13, 1936 – November 25, 1970)
"Music is the Healing Force of the Universe," the title of prolific
free-jazz musician Ayler's fierce work for the Verve label in 1969, sums
up his musical vision and prowess behind the tenor-saxophone. Born July
13th, 1936, Ayler didn’t make his mark playing his way up the ranks in
be-bop bands, yet he was exposed to the world of Little Walter inspired
R&B and the gritty sounds of the New Orleans tradition. Ayler began
making sparse, free arrangements of marching band tunes, brass band
explorations, and alto-experimentation that led him to be a driving
factor in the careers of everyone from

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

...to be fucked by Billy Collins!

SOMEONE PLEASE TELL HIM THIS!

A dear friend of mine who knows how much I LOVE the poetry of Emily
Dickinson called me today to tell me that Terry Gross was interviewing
someone about Dickinson's poems.  So I tuned into NPR and instantly
cringed at the voice of Billy Collins (the Phil Collins of poetry!)!

What ANGERED me most was when they were discussing her possible sexual
preference(s).  And he said, HE ACTUALLY SAID, that whether she was a
lesbian or not, HE was going to put to rest this argument with HIS
poem.  Which he then read.  It's called UNDRESSING EMILY DICKINSON,
and it's about wanting to FUCK HER, and how she sighs and makes little
sounds in between his removing various items of clothing from her
body.

Whether she was a lesbian or not, it's pretty clear to me that THAT
very issue turned him on enough to write his sexual fantasy of putting
his poet laureate prick inside her!

I VOMIT
I VOMIT FOR YOU EMILY

Not only that, if you listen to this show PLEASE NOTE how he makes
such a big deal about how irrelevant her biography is.  BUT THEN GOES
AHEAD AND SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT HER BIOGRAPHY ACTUALLY IS TO HIM THAT HE
WANTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT (SO TO SPEAK!)!

Has this dude NEVER heard of Susan Howe's MY EMILY DICKINSON by the
way?  Because his excessively reductive view of her poems makes me
think he needs to read Howe.

When I win the lottery I'm buying Susan Howe's MY EMILY DICKINSON for
every single library in the world!  And if they REFUSE TO TAKE IT,
I'll just put in on the shelf MYSELF!

May Emily Dickinson's ghost exact REVENGE on Billy Collins!  Dear
Emily, I'm writing a poem called UNDRESSING BILLY COLLINS, to see how
he likes gay sex!  I'll let you know how it goes!

Amiri Baraka interview at The Argotist Online:

Excerpt:
"The official Ivy League University line is that Europe is the place and th=
e culture we Uncle Sam hicks must emulate and imitate. That is why it is st=
ill the 'English' department because they are still teaching from the point=
 of view of The US as an English Colony [...] Today the cultural and arts '=
police', i.e. the formalist and academic establishment have tried to cover =
most of the art from the turbulent 60=E2=80=99s and 70=E2=80=9Ds and reintr=
oduce the passive unmusical self focused academic and formalist models. Mos=
t of the poets from the Beat, Black Mountain, San Francisco, New York Movem=
ents and Black Arts Movement  are rarely published, except occasional menti=
ons of Allen Ginsberg or another prize to John Ashbery. Great poets like La=
rry Neal or Frank O=E2=80=99Hara are rarely mentioned."

*Bowery Poetry Club Hosts Summer Finale of PRJCTNS: A Motion Picture Readin=
g
Series July 11th at 6PM Featuring Adam Pendleton and Nada Gordon*

Bowery Poetry Club is pleased to announce the summer finale of PRJCTNS: A
Motion Picture Reading Series (formerly P||R||O||J||E||C||T||I||O||N||
S) the only event showcase in New York City spotlighting practices
specifically at the intersection of poetics, performance, and the moving
image, PRJCTNS repositions the reading series as multi-genre platform,
retracing its lineage to encompass the historical phenomenon of
movie-telling as well as broader histories of performative practice. The
upcoming summer finale features multimedia artist *Adam Pendleton* and *Nad=
a
Gordon*. The performances will be followed by a Q&A with the artists.

Nodding in part to early 20th-century traditions of live film narration lik=
e
those of Benshi in Japan and Gavrilov Translation in the USSR - often
strategies for the ideological control of cinematic content - PRJCTNS
emerges alongside recent nationwide recuperations of related practices in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and beyond. The series expands movie-telling's
mechanisms of destabilizing visual meaning in considering game-based genres
like cartridge hacking and in-game intervention; post-production video
editing tactics such as gag dubbing and re-subtitling; as well as electroni=
c
techniques of appropriation and misuse including data sculpting, browser
poetry, and computational aesthetics.

A multidisciplinary ensemble of poets, filmmakers, musicians, performance
artists, scholars, critics, and editors will investigate the implementation
of these strategies across the wide spectrum of their respective fields.
PRJCTNS presents a series of scenarios whose fundamental components are liv=
e
narrators textually mediating between spectator and screen, marking the
virally trending collective urge to intervene in regulated flows of data in
media and information systems.

Go CA!
There's all kinds of new conjectural/fantasy bio material out there,
including the bio that posits epilepsy and the wacked novel, The Secret
Life of Emily Dickinson, replete with an image of a see-through skirt.
None of this has any bearing on the poems.  The industry with which
these writers produce might be better applied to close reading.

Could someone explain whether or not Emily Dickinson's sexual preference
should matter in an understanding and appreciation of her work? Should I
care, does it inform me somehow, to know if a writer is gay or not?

I am not being snarky, I am legitimately wondering.

CA, I am marooned in missouri without civilization or internet
connection, yet I feel prone to respond. While I was utterly bowled
over by 'Nine Horses' -- much to my surprise -- I am utterly disgusted
by the recurring trope of "all she needs is a night with me."

Also, Terri Gross is simply horrid.

Thanks for sharing.

He wrote this poem a loong time ago.  I've got a parody of it in my
unpublished chap of poems I hate turned into love poems.  I've got one in
there for Marvin Bell's Emily Dickinson poem, too.

There's an ENTIRE anthology of questionable Emily Dickinson poems.

Janet Holmes MS OF MY KIN is pretty nice, tho.

"To shut the eyes is travel," Emily Dickinson wrote--
"I have but to cross the room to reach the Spice Islands."

(Who knows, some psycho-babble--fantasy bio of today might say to "reach the
Spice Girls"--??--)

One might do a kind of geological survey of the succeeding strati of the
investigations into ED's life, decade by decade, and "decode" this as a
seismograph of the changing popular fads decade by decade for
"psycho-biographical interpretations . . . "--
running one's eyes along the shelves of Dickinson lore, editions of
Dickinson--
one faces a mirror not of the poet, but of the biographers--
a cracked mirror--
whose crevices, schisms, chasms, abysses, receding & advancing glaciers--
present the rhizomatic activities of a full blown "cottage" industry-

My favorite Dickinson-related tome, though, takes a slightly different tack,
though the changes in its name from one edition to another indicate some
slight geological shifting going on here, as well.

This is:
*The Poet and the Murderer*: A True Story of Literary Crime and the Art of
Forgery--

changed in its new edition to:
*The Poet and the Murderer*: A True Story of Verse, Violence and the Art of
Forgery.

Note how "A True Story of Literary Crime" must be seen as "too 'literary'"
and so is changed to "A True Story of Verse, Violence"--
someone thinking that "verse, violence" by its use of alliteration is both
"more catchy" and "more poetic"--

I highly recommend this book, which concerns not only a forged document of
ED's handwriting, but one of a forged--invented--"new" ED poem--so well
forged it was purchased by Amherst as a crowning display for its ED
collection--until . . . the honest person in charge's doubts intiates a trip
straight into the bizarre, bomb filled world of anti-Mormon ex-Mormon Mark
Hofmann, one of the great forgers of all time--

Maria, Gloria, Angela, Catherine, YES, thank you!  SOLIDARITY WITH
EMILY!  (Catherine I'd love to see your poem!)  And I actually had no
idea that his poem was old.  He's such a drag.

John, the thing I try to make clear in my post is that it's VERY
IMPORTANT information to Collins.

Hearing him talk with Terry Gross completely grossed me out.  First,
sticking with the issue at hand, in his preface to reading his poem he
is literally saying that THAT poem puts to rest the argument of her
sexuality.  As though all she needed was ONE NIGHT with Billy
Zoom-Zoom Collins and she would be off women!  His language suggests
he is an antidote to an illness, or something.  But he's clearly
masturbated thinking about bringing Emily Dickinson to her senses.  I
VOMIT AGAIN FOR HER!  And WHY didn't Terry Gross confront him????  I
don't get it.  What a lousy form for an interview!  TELL HIM HE'S A
JOKE!  For crying out loud someone has to!

The OTHER crime is how he discusses her poems.  Simple this, and
simple that.  She's so simple.  He talks as if she GOT LUCKY a lot
when writing, or something.  He didn't even allow her the surrealism
in her poems, linking that to a regional view of the world.  WHO
INVITED HIM TO WRITE THIS INTRODUCTION TO HER NEW COLLECTION?  It's
horrible that it's him!  They should have invited Susan Howe to write
an introduction and edit the collection.

Abhorrent man that Billy Phil Collins!  And his poems stink!

This specific interview sounds horrible, but why do you say that Terry Gros=
s is simply horrible? I don't listen to her very much, so I am not terribly=
 familiar with her interviewing style. I am just curious.=20

CA, I am marooned in missouri without civilization or internet
connection, yet I feel prone to respond. While I was utterly bowled
over by 'Nine Horses' -- much to my surprise -- I am utterly disgusted
by the recurring trope of "all she needs is a night with me."

Also, Terri Gross is simply horrid.

Thanks for sharing.

CA et co.,

Billy Collins is more on the periphery of my world, a name whose bad
poems often appear in poetry textbooks I peruse to decide what to use
when I teach. I used to listen to NPR as white noise, but then I
couldn't stand it even as that, so I stopped listening quite a while
ago, and I didn't hear that interview. But based on what I know, I
wanna put it out there that non-lesbians also don't want to be fucked
by Billi Collins. Yuuuuck.

CA, I think the best revenge is for you to write that poem "Undressing
Billy Collins" if you can, but I understand if you're too repulsed.

John:

I think this is a very good question. For myself, I am more interested
in gender/sexual politics only as it exists in someone's WORK as one
lens of examination of poetry (or literature) rather than as mere
fascination/autobiography. But, I would further say that when it comes
to programs that are meant for wide distribution, those questions are
asked because the answers themselves are talked about widely and the
mainstream public loves scandal and intrigue, not because it's a
worthy question for discussion.

Wow, as a fellow lesbian, I agree with Conrad. I think CA should do
the following:

1. Write Billy Collins a letter and include this email.
2. Send Billy Collins Susan Howe's book with an explanation as to why.
3. Write an article for a very prominent review that deals with the
explicit exploitation and objectification involved both in the poem
itself and in the act of using it as an argument regarding her sexual
orientation.

http://www.kathyzimmermusic.com/

If sophistication and open-hearted goodwill could combine into a =20
sound, what would it be? Enter Kathy Zimmer, a New York City singer/=20
songwriter sporting a richly wistful set of pipes and speaking the =20
language of shell-shocked wildflowers. If you=92re looking in earnest =20=

for something new, this is it.

Here=92s a theory:  Joni Mitchell is less jazz and more art song=85 as =
is =20
Kathy Zimmer.  The girl in the upstairs choir is originally from the =20
rural Great Plains, and she sings to the world with a clear voice and =20=

a clear gaze.

"A poem has so many things to which it must do equal justice if it is =20=

(and my intent here is to say it all): atomism (that sounds, at no =20

=20
(that old flow still flows, even though statement can no longer be an =20=

the particle and, because it is a thing, its =91environment=92 =96 what, =
its =20
passing through, it is different by as well as what it catches up, =20
what adheres to it); causation (but not that moralistic one =96 the =20
Coleridgian =96 of fact & reason; cause in physical sensation, the =20
obverse of which =96 what lies under it =96 giving it its allowance at =20=

all, that the systematic geometries occur superficially as the face =20
of, cause); memory (than whom there is still no muse more, the more =20
that things, in their retention, put more demand on the poet than =20
merely his =91own=92 material, shall we say); perception (of which the =20=

same extension as of memory needs to be emphasized =96 that the =20
conceptual, no matter how =91mental,=92 and as such the dipolar to =20
perception, still a powerful discrimination is basic, it is this, the =20=

actualities have to be felt, while the pure potentials can be =20
dismissed. This is the great distinction between an actual entity =20
(nothing is there except for feeling) and an eternal object (Idea).  A =20=

poem is made up of both."

through very one of his senses. Instead of missing a beat or a part, =20

the form of the question is a bit odd - "should" it make a difference? - =
there must be an entire series of presuppositions in place about the =
reading of poetry before anyone can answer that one. =20

"does" it make a difference?  it already has if we ask the question.

I'm drawing together a list of poetry in English, especially
book-length collections that might be described as documentary or
social texts. Poems that respond in a self-conscious way to a temporal
moment, be it contemporary or historical .... poems that absorb and
refashion documents and found texts.  The definition and scope are
somewhat flexible; I'll list some of the titles I've already come up
with. I suspect there are some egregious holes and oversights.  I'd
welcome suggestions of further additions that bear some family
resemblance to these:

Charles Reznikoff, _Testimony_
Muriel Rukeyser, _US 1_
Kamau Brathwaite, _Middle Passages_
Rosemarie Waldrop, _A Key Into the Language of America_
Mark Nowak, _Coal Mountain Elementary_
Allen Ginsberg, _Kaddish_
David Antin, _Code of Flag Behavior_
WC Williams, _Paterson_
Charles Olson, _Maximus_
Melvin Tolson, _Libretto for the Republic of Liberia_
Susan Howe, _Singularities_
Lorine Niedecker, "North Central"
Jerome Rothenberg, "14 Stations"

Thanks for any help.

Susan Howe's MED is my favorite book of lit crit/biography, I would even
favorite it categorized as poetry, and now that it's recently reprinted
obviously every library should have it! I will join that crusade. And can't
WAIT to read Undressing Billy Collins! HAVE FUN!

Your fan,

I feel inclined to stick up for him a little. I admit "Taking Off
Emily Dickinson's Clothes" seems straightforwardly abhorrent. Like,
the line "it was like riding a swan into the night": that line for me
fell out of the offensive tree and hit every branch on the way down.
So: was it pushed? Looked at with critical detachment, can this poem
possibly not be DESIGNED to excruciate?

For me, it's a combination of the questions (asking Catherine Deneauve
- sp?) If she still wore perfume (wtf???) and her insipid laughter.
It's as tho she has no real background on her topics -- if she did,
she wdnt have allowed collins to write dickinson off as simple.

Dear Kenneth--

In the tradition of his great grandfather Herman Melville=2C Paul Metcalf c=
ombined documentary materials with  fiction (as Melville does in Moby Dick)=
--in his great collage book Genoa: A Telling of Wonders=2C which is a novel=
 interspersed with writings of Melville's and the Dairies of Columbus.  Met=
calf then went further=2C creating works which are completely made of other=
s' writing=2C arranged as both historical/geological/floarl/fauna documenta=
ry materials arranged with a brilliant ear=2C creating music out of documen=
tary (non-literary often) texts--his masterpiece in this vein is APALACHE--=
not a word of it being Paul's=2C yet at the same time=2C by way of his eye=
=2C ears=2C hands=2C tongue making the materials both intensely personal an=
d and opening them outwards as though they have arisen from the ground itse=
lf.  (Paul lived for some time on Quarry Road=2C very appropriately=2C as S=
usan Howe once pointed out--Paul had a great influence/effect on Howe's wri=
tings=2C as he himself had made use of Olson's works--minus the misogyny.) =
Other works by Paul treat the landscape=2C the shifting of the earth's tect=
onic plates in relation with migraines and a trip on route I-57=2C through =
Illinois=2C investigating the history and landscape of the region a he cele=
brates being"I-57" (he literally had just become "I-57" as in--Paul Metcalf=
=2C 57 years old.) Several others of Paul's works combine documentary  mate=
rials with a kind of theatrical performance=2C a staging of historical even=
ts and personages in an imagined and associate theater --as in BOTH=2C a bo=
ok which combines the lives & personages of John Wilkes Booth & Edgar Allan=
 Poe (Booth/Poe yielding the "both" of the tile.)  The performance and thea=
tre aspect of the book=2C (Paul also wrote plays and performed in a few)-- =
of course=2C has as cathartic event the famous night in Ford's theater=2C i=
n which Booth plays the role of his life & assassinates President Lincoln.=
=20
Place also plays a great role=2C is a great theme in Metcalf's works--as in=
 Apalache & I-57--and in others works such as Huscaran=2C regarding he Indi=
ans of Peru=2C and The Wonderful White Whale of Kansas=2C which combines th=
e life and works of Franck Baum author of the Oz Books=2C with Moby Dick in=
to a study of the meaning of home.  Waters of Potomac=2C like Apache is the=
 "telling of --historical/geological/botanical etc--of wonders of that regi=
on=2C told=2C like Apalache via the poetic arrangement of documentary mater=
ials.  In Zip Odes=2C small poems are composed for each state in the Union =
by using places names in the different Zip Code areas of rhe country. Many =
other works combines geographical an historical materials linking race trac=
ks in North Carolinia with sites and histories in South America--

Though Metcal's works are in prose=2C it is a prose which traverses many mo=
dulations of the prose poem=2C making use of the lyrical impulse=2C the "vo=
ices" of history as in Pound's and WCW's works=2C documentary drawing on  p=
opular culture and contemporary historical events as John Dos Passos did in=
 the USA trilogy=2C and the grandeur a form of epic in APALACHE.  Though th=
e form is in physical appearance prose or prose poem=2C the underlying stru=
cturing of the works is via the ear=2C via the poetic impulses and rhythms =
which run through the flow of time=2C history=2C ge0ology=2C the lives of p=
eople=2C places=2C things=2C animals=2C insects=2C plants--

Often the poetry of Metcalf's most astonishing passages attains the conditi=
on of music-Paul was a great admirer of another user of documentary materia=
ls=2C composer Charles Ives.=20

Coffee House=2C fortunately while Paul was stil alive--published a magnific=
ent three volume Collected Works by Paul=2C which includes also his theatri=
cal pieces and essays.=20

Asked at one point about his "collage" style of poetic/documentary construc=
tion=2C Paul jokingly called it "Totem Paul"--a vertical construction of th=
e materials in space and time.=20

In another joking vein=2C as though seeing a cockeyed reflection of his own=
 mixture of the documentary and other genres/media=2C Paul once wrote to me=
 that a collage in Missouri was offering a course in the "South Sea Island =
Works of Herman Melville and the Hwiian films of Elvis Presley."

Paul was greatly admired by poets=2C more so than by prose writers. Besides=
 Susan Howe=2C Robert Creeley was a great admirer of his works=2C s was Cla=
rk Coolidge=2C among many others. For roughly a decade Paul and his wife Na=
ncy lived in close proximity to Black Mountain College and often attended e=
vents there as well as developing friendships with many of the poets and ar=
tists.=20

Paul first met Charles Olson when the latter was traveling about New Englan=
d & New York=2C in search of the scattered volumes of Melville's library--w=
ith an eye towards assebling as many of the volumes as possible for the lit=
erary treasures they contained by way of Melville's Marginalia. 12-14 years=
 old at the time=2C the much older Olson appeared to Paul as yet another on=
e of the stream of Melville fans and obssssed fanatics=2C though far larger=
=2C and far more intensely essaying not only to collect information=2C but =
to become=2C as much as possible=2C a member of the Melville/Metcalf family=
 line.  For example=2C a vivid memory of Paul's was watching the gigaticall=
y framed Olson trying to hide behind bushes as he followed Melville's daugh=
ter down the street=2C trying to imitate her wlk=2C as though  a "magical" =
way of "walking the walk" or "faking it until you make it" would transform =
him into an actual "embodiment" of the Melville "line."

I can't recommend Paul's work to you highly enough=2C with the understandin=
g=2C however=2C that he may not be techncally/formally speaking=2C conventi=
onally "poet enough" to "qualify." As Prose poetry=2C perhaps Paul's work m=
ight qualify--

Another work which is similar in some ways to Paul's is the brilliant Smith=
sonian Decompositions by Clark Coolidge.   I would highly recommend this wo=
rk=2C also--as Coolidge weaves a poetic "narrative" od a sort by combining =
quotes from interviews with Jean-Luc Godard=2C historical=2C geological tex=
ts=2C quotations from various fictional/poetical works linked by both assoc=
iative trains of thought and the poetry of pure sound (as does Paul). Smith=
sonian Decompositions=2C like many of Paul's works=2C is a work of the imag=
ination constructed out of  streams of factual "things"--quotations=2C allu=
sions=2C puns=2C "sound poetry" aspects=2C and the conveyance of visions of=
 the imagination via the sturdy=20
poem's "machine made out of words" (WCW).=20

I hope perhaps to have interested you into at least taking a look at Paul's=
 works=2C as well as Coolidge's extraordinary Smithsonian Decompositions--

Dear Kenneth--

In the tradition of his great grandfather Herman Melville, Paul Metcalf com=
bined documentary materials with=A0 fiction (as Melville does in Moby Dick)=
--in his great collage book Genoa: A Telling of Wonders, which is a novel i=
nterspersed with writings of Melville's and the Dairies of Columbus.=A0 Met=
calf then went further, creating works which are completely made of others'=
 writing, arranged as both historical/geological/floarl/fauna documentary m=
aterials arranged with a brilliant ear, creating music out of documentary (=
non-literary often) texts--his masterpiece in this vein is APALACHE--not a =
word of it being Paul's, yet at the same time, by way of his eye, ears, han=
ds, tongue making the materials both intensely personal and and opening the=
m outwards as though they have arisen from the ground itself.=A0 (Paul live=
d for some time on Quarry Road, very appropriately, as Susan Howe once poin=
ted out--Paul had a great influence/effect on Howe's writings, as he
 himself had made use of Olson's works--minus the misogyny.) Other works by=
 Paul treat the landscape, the shifting of the earth's tectonic plates in r=
elation with migraines and a trip on route I-57, through Illinois, investig=
ating the history and landscape of the region a he celebrates being"I-57" (=
he literally had just become "I-57" as in--Paul Metcalf, 57 years old.) Sev=
eral others of Paul's works combine documentary=A0 materials with a kind of=
 theatrical performance, a staging of historical events and personages in a=
n imagined and associate theater --as in BOTH, a book which combines the li=
ves & personages of John Wilkes Booth & Edgar Allan Poe (Booth/Poe yielding=
 the "both" of the tile.)=A0 The performance and theatre aspect of the book=
, (Paul also wrote plays and performed in a few)-- of course, has as cathar=
tic event the famous night in Ford's theater, in which Booth plays the role=
 of his life & assassinates President Lincoln.=20
Place also plays a great role, is a great theme in Metcalf's works--as in A=
palache & I-57--and in others works such as Huscaran, regarding he Indians =
of Peru, and The Wonderful White Whale of Kansas, which combines the life a=
nd works of Franck Baum author of the Oz Books, with Moby Dick into a study=
 of the meaning of home.=A0 Waters of Potomac, like Apache is the "telling =
of --historical/geological/botanical etc--of wonders of that region, told, =
like Apalache via the poetic arrangement of documentary materials.=A0 In Zi=
p Odes, small poems are composed for each state in the Union by using place=
s names in the different Zip Code areas of rhe country. Many other works co=
mbines geographical an historical materials linking race tracks in North Ca=
rolinia with sites and histories in South America--

Though Metcal's works are in prose, it is a prose which traverses many modu=
lations of the prose poem, making use of the lyrical impulse, the "voices" =
of history as in Pound's and WCW's works, documentary drawing on=A0 popular=
 culture and contemporary historical events as John Dos Passos did in the U=
SA trilogy, and the grandeur a form of epic in APALACHE.=A0 Though the form=
 is in physical appearance prose or prose poem, the underlying structuring =
of the works is via the ear, via the poetic impulses and rhythms which run =
through the flow of time, history, ge0ology, the lives of people, places, t=
hings, animals, insects, plants--

Often the poetry of Metcalf's most astonishing passages attains the conditi=
on of music-Paul was a great admirer of another user of documentary materia=
ls, composer Charles Ives.=20

Coffee House, fortunately while Paul was stil alive--published a magnificen=
t three volume Collected Works by Paul, which includes also his theatrical =
pieces and essays.=20

Asked at one point about his "collage" style of poetic/documentary construc=
tion, Paul jokingly called it "Totem Paul"--a vertical construction of the =
materials in space and time.=20

In another joking vein, as though seeing a cockeyed reflection of his own m=
ixture of the documentary and other genres/media, Paul once wrote to me tha=
t a collage in Missouri was offering a course in the "South Sea Island Work=
s of Herman Melville and the Hwiian films of Elvis Presley."

Paul was greatly admired by poets, more so than by prose writers. Besides S=
usan Howe, Robert Creeley was a great admirer of his works, s was Clark Coo=
lidge, among many others. For roughly a decade Paul and his wife Nancy live=
d in close proximity to Black Mountain College and often attended events th=
ere as well as developing friendships with many of the poets and artists.=
=20

Paul first met Charles Olson when the latter was traveling about New Englan=
d & New York, in search of the scattered volumes of Melville's library--wit=
h an eye towards assebling as many of the volumes as possible for the liter=
ary treasures they contained by way of Melville's Marginalia. 12-14 years o=
ld at the time, the much older Olson appeared to Paul as yet another one of=
 the stream of Melville fans and obssssed fanatics, though far larger, and =
far more intensely essaying not only to collect information, but to become,=
 as much as possible, a member of the Melville/Metcalf family line.=A0 For =
example, a vivid memory of Paul's was watching the gigatically framed Olson=
 trying to hide behind bushes as he followed Melville's daughter down the s=
treet, trying to imitate her wlk, as though=A0 a "magical" way of "walking =
the walk" or "faking it until you make it" would transform him into an actu=
al "embodiment" of the Melville "line."

I can't recommend Paul's work to you highly enough, with the understanding,=
 however, that he may not be techncally/formally speaking, conventionally "=
poet enough" to "qualify." As Prose poetry, perhaps Paul's work might quali=
fy--

Another work which is similar in some ways to Paul's is the brilliant Smith=
sonian Decompositions by Clark Coolidge.=A0=A0=A0I would highly recommend t=
his work, also--as Coolidge weaves a poetic "narrative" od a sort by combin=
ing quotes from interviews with Jean-Luc Godard, historical, geological tex=
ts, quotations from various fictional/poetical works linked by both associa=
tive trains of thought and the poetry of pure sound (as does Paul). Smithso=
nian Decompositions, like many of Paul's works, is a work of the imaginatio=
n constructed out of=A0 streams of factual "things"--quotations, allusions,=
 puns, "sound poetry" aspects, and the conveyance of visions of the imagina=
tion via the sturdy=20
poem's "machine made out of words" (WCW).=20

I hope perhaps to have interested you into at least taking a look at Paul's=
 works, as well as Coolidge's extraordinary Smithsonian Decompositions--

To be fair, you could read the poem as saying that once you've stripped away
the frills and laces generations of biographers have forced on her, what's
left are Dickinson's words. They ARE the details of her life, as Howe
writes, because it was a life lived in language. The problem is, Collins
isn't committed or crafty enough to pull it off; he settles for elaborating
a metaphor in that ernest English Professor fashion, because that's what he
thinks poetry is.
A comparison with Jimenez's "First she came to me naked" might be
interesting.

Avaaz.org - The World in Action




Dear Friends=2C



Yesterday an Iranian woman=2C Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani=2C was saved by gl=
obal protests from being stoned to death.



But she may still be hanged -- and=2C meanwhile=2C execution by stoning con=
tinues. Right now fifteen more people are on death row awaiting stoning in =
which victims are buried up to their necks in the ground and then large roc=
ks are thrown at their heads.



The partial reprieve of Sakineh=2C triggered by the call from her children =
for international pressure to save her life=2C has shown that if enough of =
us come together and voice our horror=2C we may be able to save her life=2C=
 and stop stoning once and for all. Sign the urgent petition now and send i=
t onto everyone you know -- let's end this cruel slaughter NOW!



http://www.avaaz.org/en/stop_stoning/?vl



Sakineh was convicted of adultery=2C like all the other 12 women and one of=
 the men awaiting stoning. But her children and lawyer say she is innocent =
and that she did not get a fair trial -- they state her confession was forc=
ed from her and=2C speaking only Azerbaijani=2C she did not understand what=
 was being asked of her in court.



Despite Iran's signing of a UN convention that requires the death penalty o=
nly be used for the "most serious crimes" and despite the Iranian Parliamen=
t passing a law banning stoning last year=2C  stoning for adultery continue=
s.



Sakineh's lawyer says the Iranian government "is afraid of Iranian public r=
eaction and international attention" to the stoning cases.  And after Turke=
y and Britain's Foreign Ministers spoke out against Sakineh's sentence=2C i=
t was suspended.



Sakineh's brave children are leading the international campaign to save the=
ir mother and stop stoning. Massive international condemnation now could fi=
nally stop this sickening punishment. Let's join together today across the =
world to end this brutality. Sign the petition to save Sakineh and end ston=
ing here:

Totally there agreeing - but I would avoid adding more glamor to
Collins's economic clout by forming anything with his name in it.

differently is my preference. with loves, Lisa

Subject: Seeking Titles: Documentary / Social Poetry

I'm drawing together a list of poetry in English, especially
book-length collections that might be described as documentary or
social texts. Poems that respond in a self-conscious way to a temporal
moment, be it contemporary or historical .... poems that absorb and
refashion documents and found texts.  The definition and scope are
somewhat flexible; I'll list some of the titles I've already come up
with. I suspect there are some egregious holes and oversights.  I'd
welcome suggestions of further additions that bear some family
resemblance to these:

Charles Reznikoff, _Testimony_
Muriel Rukeyser, _US 1_
Kamau Brathwaite, _Middle Passages_
Rosemarie Waldrop, _A Key Into the Language of America_
Mark Nowak, _Coal Mountain Elementary_
Allen Ginsberg, _Kaddish_
David Antin, _Code of Flag Behavior_
WC Williams, _Paterson_
Charles Olson, _Maximus_
Melvin Tolson, _Libretto for the Republic of Liberia_
Susan Howe, _Singularities_
Lorine Niedecker, "North Central"
Jerome Rothenberg, "14 Stations"

Thanks for any help.

English poet Josh Stanley's fourth book, *Contranight Escha Black*, is now
out from Critical Documents. The title sequence was lobbed off in one goeti=

egregiously Black, with our 'cute Israeli / complicity' dripping from the

Hello,
I think this is it exactly. I haven't listened to the interview, but it
seems as if Gross wanted some spicy gossip about Dickinson, not information
that would expand understanding of her work. At some point, I hope, we will
evolve past the point of thinking of someone's sexuality as a juicy tidbit
to snicker about.
John

Cult comic writer Harvey Pekar dead at 70 in Ohio
July 12, 2010, 10:44 AM EST
http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38206191/ns/today-today_books/?GT1=43001

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Comic-book writer Harvey Pekar, whose autobiographical
comic book series "American
Splendor<http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/american-splendor.1/>"
portrayed his life with bone-dry honesty and wit, was found dead at home
early Monday, authorities said. He was 70.

Officers were called to Pekar's suburban home by his wife about 1 a.m.,
Cleveland Heights police Capt. Michael Cannon said. His body was found
between a bed and dresser.

Pekar had been suffering from prostate cancer, asthma, high blood pressure
and depression, according to Cannon. Pekar had gone to bed about 4:30 p.m.
Sunday in good spirits, his wife told police.

An autopsy was planned, said Powell Caesar, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga
County coroner's office in Cleveland. He had no information on the cause of
death.

Pekar took a radically different track from the superhero-laden comics that
had dominated the industry. He instead specialized in the lives of ordinary
people, chronicling his life as a file clerk in Cleveland and his
relationship with his third wife, Joyce Brabner. His 1994 graphic novel,
"Our Cancer Year," detailed his battle with lymphoma.

The dreary cover scene shows him sprawled beside his wife on a snowy
curbside with shopping bags on the ground. "Harvey, forget about the
groceries, honey. Let's get you inside first," she says.

Pekar never drew himself but depended on collaborations with artists, most
notably his friend R. Crumb, who helped illustrate the first issue of the
ironically titled "American Splendor," published in 1976. It was made into
an acclaimed 2003
film<http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/american-splendor.1/>starring
Paul
Giamatti <http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/paul-giamatti/>. The
most recent "American Splendor" was released in 2008.

Pekar's quirky commentary developed a following and his insights and humor
were often a bit on the dark side.

Lucy Shelton Caswell, curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum
at Ohio State University, said it was inaccurate to describe Pekar's work as
"cult."

"His work was accepted by the mainstream," Caswell said. "It was bought by
public libraries and read widely." The cartoon library has all of Pekar's
works in its collection, she said.

"He will be remembered as an innovator who wrote stories about ordinary
things that were then illustrated by some of the most notable cartoonists of
the late 20th century," Caswell said. "People identified with what was
writing about and the stories that these people were drawing because it was
so ordinary."

In 2003, the New York Film Critics Circle honored "American Splendor" as
best first film for the directing-writing team of Shari Springer
Berman and Robert
Pulcini <http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/robert-pulcini/>. Part
feature and part documentary, with animated elements added, the film starred
Giamatti as the disgruntled Pekar.

Pekar, who was a repeat TV guest of David
Letterman<http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/david-letterman/>,
told The Associated Press in a 1997 interview that he was determined to keep
writing his "American Splendor" series.

"There's no end in sight for me. I want to continue to do it," Pekar said.
"It's a continuing autobiography, a life's work."

Subject:      August Postry Postcard Project
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

From Lana Ayers:

Welcome to the  August 2010 Postcard Poetry List!
http://poetrypostcards.blogspot.com/
http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=17361938720&ref=ts
http://www.concretewolf.com/august2010 to sign up for this year's project.

Here's what's involved:

Get  yourself at least 31 postcards. These can be found at book stores,  thrift
shops, online, drug stores, antique shops, museums, gift shops.  (You'll be
amazed at how quickly you become a postcard addict.)

On  or about July 27th, write an original poem right on a postcard and mail  it
to the person on the list below your name. (If you are at the very  bottom, send
a card to the name at the top.) And please WRITE LEGIBLY!

Starting  on August 1st, ideally in response to a card YOU receive, keep writing
a  poem a day on a postcard and mailing it to successive folks on the list
until you've sent out 31 postcards. Of course you can keep going and  send as
many as you like but we ask you to commit to at least 31 (a  month's worth).

What to write? Something that relates to your  sense of "place" however you
interpret that, something about how you  relate to the postcard image, what you
see out the window, what you're  reading, using a phrase/topic/or image from a
card that you got, a dream  you had that morning, or an image from it, etc. Like
"real" postcards,  get to something of the "here and now" when you write.

Do write original poems for the project. Taking  old poems and using them is not
what we have in mind. These cards are  going to an eager audience of one, so
there's no need to agonize. That's  what's unique about this experience. Rather
than submitting poems for  possible rejection, you are sending your words to a
ready-made and  excited audience awaiting your poems in their mailboxes.
Everyone loves  getting postcards. And postcards with poems, all the better.

Once  you start receiving postcard poems in the mail, you'll be able to  respond
to the poems and imagery with postcard poems or your own. That  will keep your
poems fresh and flowing. Be sure to check postage for  cards going abroad. The
Postcard Graveyard is a very sad place.

That's  all there it to it. It's that fun and that easy.

To check out  what we've done before, visit the blog [where you'll also see we
also  have Perennial Poetry Postcard List of folks who try to write a postcard
poem at least once a week regardless of receiving in order to keep  connections
flowing.], Paul Nelson's website or our Facebook group.

To  get started, click to register. Once you've registered, you just need  to
login to see the list of participants.

Email postcardpoetry@yahoo.com if you have  any questions.

THE NEXT OBJECTIVISTS is a free, open-to-the-public poetry workshop dedicat=
ed to the study & reproduction of the outsidereal. We take this term from t=
he =E2=80=9CBlack Mountain=E2=80=9D poet Edward Dorn & our name from the se=
cond generation modernist poets associated with The Objectivist Press. Alth=
ough writers associated with the Objectivists and Black Mountain =E2=80=9Cs=
chools=E2=80=9D (Bunting, Creeley, H.D., Niedecker, Pound, Reznikoff, Willi=
ams, Zukofsky to name only those we've already studied) are prominent stars=
 in our constellation, our objective is not to reproduce any particular sty=
le, mode or tradition, but instead to draw on many different ways of doing =
and making in order to isolate those practices of writing & publishing & ab=
ove all those poetic effects which lead us out of the neoliberal present & =
the future it imagines.

The Next Objectivists Poetry Workshop was founded in January 2009. From the=
n until now it meets every other Thursday evening (7:00 - 10:00) at Mess Ha=
ll (http://www.messhall.org/) in Rogers Park, Chicago.  Members make the cu=
rriculum as we go along. Our meetings are potlucks and beginners are always=
 welcome.  We read, discuss & write poetry together. As time allows we publ=
ish our findings through our website: http://nextobjectivists.blogspot.com=

Red Rover Series is curated by Laura Goldstein and Jennifer Karmin. Each ev=
ent is designed as a reading experiment with participation by local, nation=
al, and international writers, artists, and performers. The series was foun=
ded in 2005 by Amina Cain and Jennifer Karmin.

it had dawned on some of them that they were already living in a
post-capitalist world, but still it wasn't quite clear what that would
eventually mean. what was clear, however, was that "marketplaces" and
"poetry" just didn't have much in common anymore. paying the meagre
connection even lip service had become tiresome and insulting.

of course not.

Cleveland jazzbeaus. He would call us up on saturday (our only real sales

Ammons.

Harvey did a fantastic strip called "Local Poet" which is sadly not in
the "best of" volume that came out when the movie was released. It
perfectly captured a local scene (with even a nod to da levy!) & to the
reality of being a working poet. This was characteristic of the best of his
work -- being able to get inside the nuances of everyday lived life --
another example was "Standing Behind Old Jewish Ladies in the Supermarket
Line". he was also an acute observer of racial and ethnic differnces in a
working class community. The best of this stuff is found in the early
issues, before Harvey starts appearing on the old Letterman Late, late show
& becomes a bit of a cult object.

Hopefully, someone will collect pekar's jazz writings, mostly reviews and,
in later years, liner notes. They were honest and informed. Unlike a lot of
older fans, he keep up with jazz currents. I interviewed him for an article
at the time of his "Our Cancer Year". He was telling me about his interest
in John Zorn & the then-rising "downtown scene" & added "I'm always
interested in what's going on NOW."

Dear Kenneth,

If you are interested in exploring historically grounded writing that
is just beyond the standard canon you might take a look at Brian
Turner's _Here Bullet_, Barrett Watten's _Bad History_, Eliot
Weinberger's _What Happened Here_, Rodrigo Toscano's dramatic-poetic
engagements in _Collapsible Poetics Theater_, and Ali Zarrin's _I Made
You Mine, America_ and _The Book of I_.

Best wishes for your project.

Dear Mark--

Many thanks!!  (How cd i forget a title i love so much!--)

I had just been writing abt "Decompositions" and so "they" found their way
into the "Smithsonian Depostions"--!!

Perhaps one might call it the  "Decomposition of Old  Depositions Muddied
the Inks of Composition: Seismic Shifts in Title Recall Affect Textual
Topographies"

Thanks again Mark and all very best for your summer--
et--- Joyeux Fetes!! pour le Quartrorze Juillet!

 Nice piece, thanks. You raise this as the most presssing question for our time:
"Why is the world failing in its promise of justice for all?" Well what about
Badiou to name just one obvious example? He has a radical egalitarian philosophy
& is also active politically, involved with the sans papiers in France. Agreed,
though, that there are too few philosophers around, in your sense of the word,
but were there ever enough?
Best,
Jeroen

"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?"

Tuli Kupferberg, Poet, Songwriter, Anarchist, Jew - Dies at 86

  Born Norman or in Hebrew, Naphtali on Sept 28, 1923 (one day and 22
years before me), poet, singer-songwriter, revolutionary, publisher,
street vender, historian, mentor sage, wise man and wise guy,
forward-thinking artist, activist, intellectual,pacifist, teacher,
dreamer with a desire to contribute his ideas for the construction of a
better world, boho and dear friend Tuli Kupferberg,who, though never
really considering himself  Beat was anthologized as early as 1959 in
Fred Mcdarrah's The Beat Scene, died on Monday at N.Y. Downtown Hospital
in Manhattan at the age of 86 after a prolonged battle with Life and all
its joys and griefs and after suffering two dibilitating strokes. In the
1964  at age 40 he went on to become, in own his words, “the world’s
oldest rock star” after co-founding the Fugs with poet Ed  Sanders, and
then-member Ken Weaver. They were in my opinion the first
poetry/folk-rock band and a definite precursor of punk, bawdy and
politically outspoken. Their first lp was produced by the equally
legendary Harry Smith on Broadside and later re-issued on ESP along with
their other lps. His first solo record, No Deposit, No Return was also
issued by ESP. At the height of their career during the psychedelic era
the group was signed by the then co-owned Frank Sinatra label Reprise who
also signed Hendrix among others. When very he young worked as a medical
librarian.


 Tuli lived 2 blocks from my apt. We first officially met while both of
us were hawking our wares on the street though I had known him through
the music having first seen the Fugs play way back in the '60s in various
venues such as a loft space on Great Jones street, the Provincetown
Theatre, The Astor Place Theater, and once even at a free concert in
Thompkins Square Park, where, standing behind me to my amazement was none
other than Charles Mingus. When Tuli and I first conversed some time in
the mid-70's he was hawking these pamphlets which were I think, like
$1.29 for one and 99 cents for two, the catch being the more you bought
the cheaper the became. Though I could be wrong , memory being what it is
> Hey Tuli help me out here. He was fluent in yiddish. Had a passion for
Yiddish theater which he shared with fellow poet and street vendor Harry
Nudel and though he loved being a Yid was an avid supporter of Palestine.
Tuli always told me he hated poetry and the scene in general.  He was
never hierarchical and didn't choose his friends on their status in the
art world but on his ability to share with them his knowledge, sharp wit
and love. There were the many times we sat together in the park sharing a
pint of Haagen Daz or a Good Humor bar. He loved ice cream. Particularly
chocolate.


Tuli's great songs included Morning, Morning, Kill For Peace and Nothing.
On their last cd he wrote the poignantly beautiful " Where is My
Wandering Jew Tonight" never forgetting his roots. Another song in that
vein and of mocking protest was "Backward Jewish Soldiers"  a para-song
based on "Onward Christrian Soldiers."  Tuli became something of
celebrity when he was mentioned in  Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” as being the
one who “jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge" then walking away "unknown and
forgotten.” It was actually the Manhattan Bidge but the Brooklyn Bridge
seemed more romantic. Actually he didn't walk away but was to Gouveneur
Hospital with a minor spinal fracture.

He was published in and published such zines as Birth and Yeah and was
the first to publish the African - American Beat poet Ted Joans as well
as over 50 of his own books.
He loved to take standard tunes which were called para-songs and write
his own lyrics to them doing this more and more in his later years and
while bedridden wrote a series of short pieces he called "perverbs"
punning on well-known aphorisms and posting them on YouTube. He had a
long running cable show called Revolting News which in its latter stages
was filmed and edited by his long time partner Thelma Blitz.

Tuli has spent the past 20 or so years selling his cartoons on the street
( me spending many of them with him or directly across the street selling
lps and books) and inspiring many of us to not give up despite the
adversities of government, war and $$$$. He embraced his Beatnik
lifestyle as a friend once told me I should. He never shrank from his
commitment to protest injustice. Never gave into the "MAN". Never took
the straight and narrow path.  Always fought corporate interests and a
greedy, demonic capitalistic value system.



Long time drummer for the Fugs Coby Batty told me this story on the phone
the day Tuli passed that one day while walking in Brooklyn Tuli turned
and said that he wanted his epitaph to read "What the hell was that?" -
and as he mentioned in one of his perverbs  - "Life is funny, you can
die." How Jewish can ya get??

His is survived by his wife, Sylvia Topp, three children, grand kids.

I didn't know Pekar, but this spring he came out to Berkeley to do a
performance along with Dan Plonsey (a local composer & a colleague) at the
Center for Jewish Studies. Plonsey and Pekar they had collaborated on an
opera. The evening was very loosely structured; but I agree that Pekar's
discussion of jazz was very much focused on contemporary music. The parts of
the opera Plonsey's band and Pekar performed were compelling -- I hope the
performance as a whole is revived.

Very sorry to hear this.  I spent some time with Ed Sanders many years ago.=
  I met Tuli on the streets of Soho.  He was sitting behind a little sidewa=
lk table (Spring Street), selling his poetry.  Of course I own the Fugs' re=
cordings.  When they were appearing at the Cafe Wha, I was a regular perfor=
mer a block away at the Cafe Bizarre.  Those were great days.

So long, Tuli.  Write for the sky.

We have arranged to hold a service for Tuli at St. Marks church from 12-3
on Saturday, with a reception following shortly thereafter. We will have
a viewing in a separate room at the beginning of the service for anyone
who wishes to see him.
We are still working on the details for the reception and will let you
know shortly. There will be no religious element to the service, and
Coby, Steve and Ed will be the main speakers, after which anyone who
wants to can talk, sing, recite poetry, or whatever they like.
He will be buried at Greenwood cemetery in Brooklyn on Monday morning at
9 am.
We will send out another email with more details once we have figured
them out, but you are welcome to tell anyone who asks, the funeral is
open to whoever wishes to attend.

Thanks - I've a few of Badiou's books - his writing is fairly interesting. I
agree - if you're implying that there have never been enough philosophers. And
that's one point, I suppose. And we've reached the point of diminishing returns
for institutionalized philosophy, and poetics, I imagine.

Nice piece, thanks. You raise this as the most presssing question for our time:
"Why is the world failing in its promise of justice for all?" Well what about
Badiou to name just one obvious example? He has a radical egalitarian philosophy

& is also active politically, involved with the sans papiers in France. Agreed,
though, that there are too few philosophers around, in your sense of the word,
but were there ever enough?
Best,
Jeroen

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "King Amour" by Jack Foley.

Description:=20

Jack Foley=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CKing Amour=E2=80=9D are amour-plated adventur=
es that take the rider on a fifty-year journey in a soi-disant con-sciousne=
ss that takes itself serially and postulates both pos and impostures in a g=
rand, grad granulation of mic and picturation. The Kong is dead, but the Ko=
nig kicks. Who but Amour would dorothy these ravings? As the great, inspiri=
ng, and possibly loony Samuel Greenberg wrote, =E2=80=9CThe blue, faded pur=
ple, horizon mount / Seemed to bellow the valleys in mists / Of enriching, =
ensuing, divine shadowings... / Where may this be?

Available as a free ebook here:

Interview with Norman Fischer at The Argotist Online:
Excerpt:
"First, no one needs me to write, there are enough great writers already. S=
econd, I must do this, and will always fail, yet this doesn=E2=80=99t matte=
r. I will continue to believe that I will get it right the next time and th=
is belief will keep me going. It strikes me that writing (at least writing =
as I view it, experimental--if that is the word, though I am sure it is not=
--writing) is a faith. An irrational faith. Really, it is a religion for wr=
iters, writing. Writing, you feel whole. Not writing, you feel sinful, unho=
ly, incomplete, guilty, not right. Even if no one is paying money or attent=
ion, and you are not getting anywhere at all, you have to do it. I was thin=
king this the other day, talking to the many good friends, poets, who were =
at Leslie Scalapino=E2=80=99s funeral, a full on Zen Buddhist funeral at wh=
ich I was officiating: that religion is essentially an imaginative practice=
.  As writing is. It=E2=80=99s not =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D in the sense we c=
ommonly use that word. Writing is also not real. And yet it is essential."

Description:
In =E2=80=9CBrainiography=E2=80=9D Evelyn Posamentier creates a dreamscape =
in which objects become animate and humans objectified, both inhabiting a m=

neither pre-modern nor postmodern, a compelling narrative brings language t=
o a turning point. Here is poetry responsive to encounters with world and t=
echnology=E2=80=94brutal and immediate. A new form of witness.

Jake Berry and Chris Mansel in Conversation

=E2=80=9CThere is still great poetry sneaking out as pop music because that=
's the medium in which it is performed. It's a long list and everyone that =
really loves popular music and devotes time to listening to it will know im=
mediately what I'm talking about. When I use the term popular music, I mean=
 all the music that has been popular in terms of a large audience (compared=
 to other forms like classical, avant-garde, art song and so forth) over th=
e last century as recording technology has made music available to everyone=
.
=20
There's no small amount of modernism in pop music either. But you rarely he=
ar people complain about the difficulty of a Radiohead lyric for instance, =
or the obscurity of Beck's references. People talk about the words. They re=
cognize them as being more abstract, but that isn't a problem. There are mi=
llions of people walking around singing lyrics that are open to as many int=
erpretations as there are listeners and few have a problem with this.
=20
Does the fact that you can sing an obscure bit of poetry make it better som=
ehow than reading it in a book? Maybe it does. Maybe someone should set The=
 Maximus Poems to a nice backbeat, mix in a heavy bass line and some nice g=
uitar licks. I bet if a successful artist did that and didn't call any atte=
ntion to the fact, beyond the essential permission notice buried in the cre=
dits, we'd have people all over the world singing Olson.=E2=80=9D

GLOUCESTER WRITERS CENTER
Contact: henry.ferrini@verizon.net or 978-281-2355
(Peter Anastas, Charles Olson and Vincent Ferrini, left to right,
at 126 East Main Street c.1965. Mark Power photograph)

Gloucester may soon be home to a new cultural and literary center.

When Gloucester=E2=80=99s Poet Laureate Vincent Ferrini died on Christmas=
 Eve 2007, many of
his friends in Gloucester and around the world hoped his house could be pu=
rchased and
turned into a center where artistic activities could be shared with the co=
mmunity. Today
this idea is very close to becoming a reality.

Plans are progressing to establish The Gloucester Writers Center at the Fe=
rrini house in
Gloucester, Massachusetts. This former home of Vincent Ferrini (1913-2007)=
 lies across
the harbor from Charles Olson=E2=80=99s (1910-1970) 28 Fort Square home.=
 These two poets,
known as the consciences of our city for over half a century, wrote about=
 Gloucester with
enlightened passion and energy. Organizers of this project believe it is=
 only fitting that a
place that honors their work and keeps their vision alive be established.

Since Ferrini=E2=80=99s death Paul Sawyer, an old friend of Vincent=E2=80=
=99s who lives in California, has
been advocating for the purchase of the house. This spring, Sawyer, a Unit=
arian-
Universalist Minister, called Vincent=E2=80=99s nephew filmmaker Henry Fer=
rini to report that he
has Pancreatic Cancer and has been given a year to live. With that time he=
 wanted to put
his energy toward helping to create a Vincent Ferrini/ Charles Olson Write=
rs Center at
Vincent=E2=80=99s East Main Street studio. The poet=E2=80=99s nephew was=
 moved by Reverend Sawyer=E2=80=99s
decision.

=E2=80=9CHis decision has motivated many people close to Vincent, Charles=
 and Paul to
work toward creating an innovative educational and cultural organization=
 that will be a
lasting asset to Gloucester.=E2=80=9D Ferrini said.

To date the group has raised $84,900 toward the purchase price of $100,000=
.
According to Ferrini, the timing and situation for this project couldn=E2=
=80=99t be better.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9C Raising the $100,000 means we=E2=80=99ll be mortgage free and ta=
x-exempt, an enviable
position for any organization. The Center can live on in perpetuity with=
 out much
overhead. Plus 2010 is Charles Olson=E2=80=99s Centenary,=E2=80=9D he says=
, =E2=80=9Cand attention is focused on
Olson and Gloucester.=E2=80=9D

The group hopes that by the time Gloucester celebrates Olson=E2=80=99s cen=
tenary in
October the house will be open to tour. Tax-deductible contributions for=
 the
establishing of the Ferrini Olson Writers Center can be made to the Charle=
s Olson
Society and sent to Henry Ferrini, 5 Wall Street, Gloucester, MA 01930

including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MOMA, the Whitney Museum of
American Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., museums in Holland,
Australia, Japan and Germany and public art commissions all over the
world. He also holds several U.S. patents. Snelson was a student at
Black Mountain College in the summers of 1948 and 1949, where he
worked closely with Buckminster Fuller, and where he discovered the
principle known as "tensegrity". Known primarily for his gravity
defying sculptures, Snelson is also an accomplished photographer with
a particular interest in panoramic photographs. The recent publication
Kenneth Snelson: Forces Made Visible traces this important artist's
five-decade career.

Papers, performances, multi-media and panel proposals in all relevant
disciplines are welcome.  Abstracts of 400-600 words should be
submitted to Brian Butler (bbutler@unca.edu) by July 31, 2010.
Notification will be made by August 28, 2010.


(I'm hoping for some good panels on Olson, myself)

Early on in *Expanding The Radius*, Mary Ellen Derwis gives us an untitled
narrative sequence of digital art, hinting at the human form, which picks u=
p
again towards the end of the book in a more figurative sequence=97
=93Rendezvous=94. Intimate portraits, wider anthropological insights, and o=
ther
strongly titled art also prevail.  Among other tightly woven directives, Jo=
e
Balaz includes multi-paged narrations =93High in Blue=94, =93Fairly Textual=
=94, and
=93The Industrial Poet=94. Then there are the collaborations which find a
distinct third voice, as often happens when two people are so creatively in
synch. The book ends with two of Mary Ellen=92s urban shots that include
typographical symbols and a similar photo, a final pun by Joe=97 =93C and
Leave=94. Many of these images have appeared separately in the quarterly
=93Otoliths=94; now it=92s a pleasure to see/read this combined three heade=
d body
of always direct, sometimes humorous, often profound digital art, visual
poetry, and collaborations. =97*C. Mehrl Bennett*

Station Hill announces the fall publication of:

Squeezed Light: Collected Poems 1994-2005
by Lissa Wolsak

Lissa Wolsak, a poet who seemingly emerged fully-formed in the mid-1990s,
now offers access to the realized body of her work in this collection.
Neither easily classified nor directly traceable to a particular school or
lineage, she stands instead within her own continuously evolving context=97=
one
as free of convention and fashion as it is independent of thought outside
the work itself. =93The mirror would do well to reflect further,=94 demands=
 Jean
Cocteau=92s Orphic radio voice, and Wolsak=92s poetry answers to this stran=
ge
admonition: For the self-reflective moment in her work takes us far beyond
familiar literary practices of self-attention and recursive discourse. Agai=
n
and again this work reaches a genuinely mysterious interpenetration of vivi=
d
awareness, renewed language, and human care.

SQUEEZED LIGHT includes all of Wolsak=92s previously published poetry to da=
te,
her essay in poetics =93An Heuristic Prolusion,=94 an interview with the au=
thor,
and an introductory essay by George Quasha with Charles Stein.

For a PDF of SQUEEZED LIGHT for review consideration, please email
publishers@stationhill.org

All past poets, in particular, Pound and Zukofsky, were not porous enough.
Lissa Wolsak subtends as egregiously porous. She pours tenacious
slipperiness every which way=97how very yes.
=97Madeline Gins

It=92s not that Lissa Wolsak=92s words are made up, but that the words have=
 made
up a relation between themselves that is of the author. In order for isolat=
e
words to be continuous =93acts of symmetry,=94 they are =93to move through =
that
silence which linear language admits, its lack of fullness, its utter
necessity.=94 Her words are this non-random arising in necessity.
=97Leslie Scalapino

I am still learning to read Lissa Wolsak=97an immensely entertaining and
demanding project. I am being reeducated in the pleasures of using the
dictionary to discover how awareness of the roots and branches of words
tightens their hold on the world.

for years now i've watched poets (many of whom identify themselves with rad=
ical politics, "progressive" thinking, non-normative practices) do nothing =
more than reproduce the logic of market systems and commodity culture by pa=
rticipating in (or, worse, organizing) poetry competitions engineered expre=
ssly for the purpose of roping in cash and fostering a competitive rather t=
han cooperative cultural environment (&, yes, competition and cooperation a=
re in _no_ uncertain way mutually exclusive).=20

but fair competition is a good thing, right? like, if only we could weed ou=
t a few greedy apples then market-based economies (cultural and otherwise) =
would be beneficial to all, no? and who doesn't want to win?=A0=A0=20

Rexroth was spot on when he wrote: "If offered a crown | refuse." Charles I=
ves was spot on when he sd: "Awards are badges of mediocrity."=20

&&& while we're at it, cld poets given to a responsible sense of cultural p=
olitics PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop appealing to the language of submission. =
it's incredibly demoralizing to see so many poets so willingly "submit" to =
editors that, more often than not, are about as capable of recognizing prod=
uctive work as Paula Abdula or Simon Cowell. & it's even more reprehensible=
 when editors create a situation that expects others to "submit." man, for =
people so attuned to the complexities and the ideological underpinnings of =
language i find it utterly astounding that so many gleefully accept that la=
nguage of submission and the practice of competition.=A0 =A0=20

but, then again, it's all abt building a respectable career, right? & so lo=
ng as you grapple w/ gender difference, race, subjectivity or class politic=
s in yr poetry or critical work, well there's no need to worry abt how the =
practices that feed the poetry industry might also reproduce the logic that=
 guarantees inequality and injustice.=20

Thank you Richard for expressing your clear principles concerning
prize culture and languages of 'submission'. With warmth and respect I
note that the latter part of your message might get a little away from
that message - I see no need to suggest editorial incompetence in
order to make points about competition and the politics of speech
acts. And I can't make an easy equation between competition and
acceptable topics for poetry & critical work.

But I do concur with your points about competitiveness and the
'submit' button. About prize culture especially I agree - universites
love to have their workers win prizes, and it is a challenge to find
ways of opting out of submitting to prizes. Part of that resistance
involves, at least for me, reminding my employers, locally, of the
kind of work I do, aspire to do, and value from others. And creating
and participating in contexts for cooperation, which are sometimes
local - like the current trans-Tasman Home & Away events we're doing
here this year - and sometimes as wide as this list is long.
Warm regards,
Lisa

Wonderful essay, Adam. Romantic Deconstructionist poetry is a possibility.
I've come to believe the words 'soul' and 'spirit' aren't offensive as much
as inadequate for describing our encounter with the infinite.

What I still wonder, though, is:

What else are younger poets supposed to do? Which door does one stick one's
foot into in the hopes of keeping it open?

I feel like I hear a lot of anti-reading period/submission stuff from people
who are further ahead in their careers.

Are the rest of us just supposed to work quietly in our bedrooms and hope
somebody takes notice?

I've self published a chapbook. But it can be so expensive, especially if y=
r
trying to go beyond typical chapbook formatting (for instance with my DIY
chapbook, the vellum cover with card stock backing, the paper I bought, the
printer's fee...all of this cost me nearly $200 for 30 COPIES. And then, I
think I've sold 5. I gave away some, but for the most part people ask how
they can get one and then when I tell them the 25 (roughly) page hand
stitched, designed from scratch, all materials bought and paid for and all
the production work done by me and a couple friends is say $10 or even $8
it's an oh never mind. That's pricey for a book. Self-publishing has its
merits (obviously, since I've done it a few times), but it IS difficult to
up the ante sometimes on an aesthetic level.

I'd also like to echo the comment about people who already have established
themselves opposing these competitions and reading fees. Where is this door=
?
Call me shallow but I actually CRAVE the opportunity to be associated with =
a
press, to engage in a community of fellow authors, to interact with a nexus
of people who are involved in the book and in poetry in mediums and artways
drastically different than my own. It's valuable. Typesetting my own work,
designing the cover and layout, choosing the paper and materials for the
cover, scrounging up public domain visuals, hand stitching...it's an
invaluable experience, but it's also completely monological. And you become
limited, very often in a technological sense if yr working with other peopl=
e
who are self-publishing. You simply don't have the means to produce work th=
e
way a boutique press, or academic press, or even some small presses can. Yr
aesthetic choices are STILL LIMITED (although the interaction I've had with
other self-publishing writers has been invaluable as well). So while I agre=
e
with Richard's sentiment and am immeasurably appreciative of Pierre
supporting the sentiment it's worth pointing out that besides the
exploitative nature of the competition and reading fee system, it's worth
pointing out the other drawbacks behind another fundamental feature of
capitalist production and culture: (1) the "workers" don't own the means of
production (2) in many cases the "workers" are producing above "value" and
beyond what they are paid in return for that production=97i.e, we produce m=
ore
than enough value to provide for our own subsistence and yet only receive
"wages" enough to subsist=97which is really just an unnecessarily wordy
definition of the labor theory of value. Anyway, I think both of those
points should be considered as well.

HELP ! ! !



I need some help. I'm annotating Robert Duncan's poems (translating foreign
words and phrases, identifying their source) for the Collected Later Poetry
and Plays, and I'm getting into difficulties in GROUND WORK II: IN THE DARK.
I'm stuck in more than one place, and may be calling for help from time to
time. Here's the first:

The poem is "IN WONDER" (pages 227-229 in the single-volume Ground Work)

1. "NORGOL" - the word occurs twice: "norgol" and "Nor-gol."

The poem hints it might come from science fiction - Duncan read Andre Norton
(among others) and it might be from something by her - or from Tolkien's The
Lord of the Rings (but there I'm grasping at straws). Googling "Norgol" I
find that it's a name in a wargame, but so far as I can tell the game
post-dates the poem.

Does anyone out there know?



2. The mixed German and French at the top of page 228 ends with "kasts", but
my sources (native-speakers of German) tell me this is not a word in German,
though it appears in the title of an autobiographical novel (The
Unrestrained Life of Kast) by Volker Braun, published in 1972. I don't know
German; Braun's book has not been translated into English.

Can anyone help me here?



Thanks.



Peter

"Stay in Cagnes. The view is charming."

"Holland's not bad." I said. "Canals everywhere ..."

"What are you going to do there?" H=E9l=E8ne asked.

"A scandal," said Gilles.

"That goes without saying. But what else?"

"A real scandal," I said. "In a museum."

Bertrand intervened, very interested:

"Is that really why you're going?"

"Not exactly," I explained. "Some friends will do it. But in cases like
these, Gilles usually shows up ahead of time to organize the thing."

"We all end up specializing in something," said Gilles.

"And do you always organize them?" insisted Bertrand.

"One well-planned scandal is worth two," I said.

"Will they talk about it in the papers?"

"In books, rather."

"Let's go have a drink," proposed H=E9l=E8ne.

"Or eat, if it's not too late."

what if submission were a holy action?

what if it allowed humility?

Send work to journals you admire. And don't think=20
of it as a career. What matters is the=20
conversation with one's peers, and with the history of the craft.

Hi Peter,

"kast" seems to be a Dutch word, for a sort of armoire that was taken up in
parts of America: see this link
http://www.artnet.com/magazine/features/garrett/garrett2-14-00.asp

I'm not sure whether "kasts" would be plural--don't know Dutch.

Hope you're well.

Hilary Clark

As Richard's email was in response to the announcement I'd posted here=2C I=
 can't help but take his comment about the lack of editorial acumen as pers=
onal=2C even if it included the "more often that not" caveat. Subito Press =
was founded at the University of Colorado-Boulder by my colleague Elisabeth=
 Sheffield. It's not "my" press. I was simply passing on an announcement ab=
out it. Like Richard=2C I've been frustrated in the past by what I perceive=
d of as a dearth of uninteresting work being brought into the world. But ra=
ther than grip about it=2C I decided=2C along with a friend to found a pres=
s (http://www.lettermachine.org/catalog.html) that would function as a sort=
 of polemic=2C where our books would collectively make an argument for what=
 we see as representative of the work being done that is wholly valuable fo=
r the state of (& future of) the art.=20
=20
Letter Machine Editions does not have a contest. We did=2C however=2C have =
an open reading period recently=2C one where we asked for $10. For this $10=
=2C we offered to mail any title from our backlist to whomever submitted. T=
he cost of a mailing envelop is around one dollar. The cost to mail the boo=
k is about two dollars. The actual cost per book=2C the amount we pay to pu=
blish each book=2C including all fees=2C shipping=2C charges to list the bo=
ok with SPD=2C designer fees=2C etc. ranges from about $4 to $8 per book (o=
ur full-length titles are offset pressed=2C not digit)=2C for a total cost =
of from $7 to $11 dollars. This is to say we are not making money off of ou=
r reading fees=2C rather we're getting our books out into the world and get=
ting a chance to see work by folks we might not otherwise see. I've persona=
lly already gone over $5=2C000 into debt=2C and had to open up new credit c=
ards=2C just to fund this press. Not for some sort of careerist gain=2C but=
 because I believe in the books we=92re publishing & want to see them move =
into the world.=20
=20
That said=2C I realize that the initial response to my email was more of an=
 attack on the contest system. Yes=2C I also think it has its faults. But n=
o=2C I don't think those poet who've won contests really care all that much=
 about the contest itself. It's more of a means to simply get the work into=
 the world. I mean=2C even John Latta=2C who commented here is a book conte=
st winner. Here are a few more off the top of my head:=20
=20
Nathaniel Mackey
Juliana Spahr
Cole Swensen
Elizabeth Willis
John Ashbery
Rodrigo Toscano
Ange Mlinko
Joshua Clover
Ed Roberson
John Yau
Laura Mullen
Graham Foust
Jena Osman
Laynie Browne
Eleni Sikelianos
Elizabeth Robinson
=20
Maybe these people would shun contest now=2C but that's because they've had=
 the opportunity to establish themselves in some (& not always so) small wa=
y through having won one. This is why I think Pierre Joris's comment about =
them being scam affairs comes from a place of privilege. Although I respect=
 all of the many years he=92s put into poetry=2C teaching=2C translation=2C=
 etc.=2C it's just not that easy=2C as Amish Trivedi notes=2C for a young p=
oet to break into the scene. Yes=2C I'm an advocate for starting your own p=
ress and journal=2C both of which I did. But for folks not lucky enough to =
live in a city with a large=2C active poetry community=2C or to study at a =
school like the University of Buffalo (as Richard did)=2C with its instant =
community and funding for student-editing projects=2C it can be a daunting =
thing. Yes=2C creating alterative market systems is one answer. I think we =
all think Sub Press is pretty amazing. But the problem is much deeper than =
the tiny market systems of poetry. One can't up & move to NYC to be a poet =
these days without being somehow independently wealthy. That wasn't always =
the case=2C tho.=20
=20
I just think the energy expended in arguing about this would be better dire=
cted into actual action. I mean if you're going to end your email=2C as Ric=
hard did=2C by bringing up inequality and injustice=2C aren't there other m=
eans to more efficaciously address these issues?=20

Same story--submission fees--in "anonymous" visual art competitions.  The
only difference is that I've never heard of an exhibition opportunity that
didn't include a hefty per item fee.

New from Chax Press: Mark Weiss, As Landscape.
$16.  Order from http://www.chax.org/poets/weiss.htm


"What a beautiful set of circumstances! What a
lovely concatenation of particulars. Here is the
poet alive in every sense of the word, and
through every one of his senses. Instead of
missing a beat or a part, Weiss' fragments are
like Chekhov's short stories­the more that gets
left out, the more they seem to contain. One can
hear echoes from all the various
ancestors...[but] the voice, at its center, its
core, is pure Mark Weiss. His use of the fragment
is both elegant and bafflingly clear, a pure
musical threnody.[it] opens a window, not only
into a mind, but a person, a personality, this
human figure at the emotional center of the poem."

This has been a very interesting discussion, in my opinion. Noah, I really =
appreciate your comments and defense of the poetry contests in response. I =
have very little to do with other poets in my daily life, other than the po=
ets who I "meet" online and whose work I read. I find it reassuring that ev=
en though our motives are not ALWAYS the purest if we were to be honest wit=
h ourselves, we are/ you are/I am working towards an openness and a non-com=
petitiveness in creating and getting poems out there, considering that most=
 everything else is so very competitive; we live in a cut throat dog eat do=
g...and other cliches, world. Without a doubt, we, poets, cannot always get=
 away from what we deplore, but we can look at it, respond to it, and think=
 of other ways to do what we believe in, which is to write, read, and respo=
nd to poetry, since poetry is really about the world, the universe, each ot=
her, etc. etc.=20

Thanks.

As Richard's email was in response to the announcement I'd posted here, I c=
an't help but take his comment about the lack of editorial acumen as person=
al, even if it included the "more often that not" caveat. Subito Press was =
founded at the University of Colorado-Boulder by my colleague Elisabeth She=
ffield. It's not "my" press. I was simply passing on an announcement about =
it. Like Richard, I've been frustrated in the past by what I perceived of a=
s a dearth of uninteresting work being brought into the world. But rather t=
han grip about it, I decided, along with a friend to found a press (http://=
www.lettermachine.org/catalog.html) that would function as a sort of polemi=
c, where our books would collectively make an argument for what we see as r=
epresentative of the work being done that is wholly valuable for the state =
of (& future of) the art.=20
=20
Letter Machine Editions does not have a contest. We did, however, have an o=
pen reading period recently, one where we asked for $10. For this $10, we o=
ffered to mail any title from our backlist to whomever submitted. The cost =
of a mailing envelop is around one dollar. The cost to mail the book is abo=
ut two dollars. The actual cost per book, the amount we pay to publish each=
 book, including all fees, shipping, charges to list the book with SPD, des=
igner fees, etc. ranges from about $4 to $8 per book (our full-length title=
s are offset pressed, not digit), for a total cost of from $7 to $11 dollar=
s. This is to say we are not making money off of our reading fees, rather w=
e're getting our books out into the world and getting a chance to see work =
by folks we might not otherwise see. I've personally already gone over $5,0=
00 into debt, and had to open up new credit cards, just to fund this press.=
 Not for some sort of careerist gain, but because I believe in the
 books we=E2=80=99re publishing & want to see them move into the world.=20
=20
That said, I realize that the initial response to my email was more of an a=
ttack on the contest system. Yes, I also think it has its faults. But no, I=
 don't think those poet who've won contests really care all that much about=
 the contest itself. It's more of a means to simply get the work into the w=
orld. I mean, even John Latta, who commented here is a book contest winner.=
 Here are a few more off the top of my head:=20
=20
Nathaniel Mackey
Juliana Spahr
Cole Swensen
Elizabeth Willis
John Ashbery
Rodrigo Toscano
Ange Mlinko
Joshua Clover
Ed Roberson
John Yau
Laura Mullen
Graham Foust
Jena Osman
Laynie Browne
Eleni Sikelianos
Elizabeth Robinson
=20
Maybe these people would shun contest now, but that's because they've had t=
he opportunity to establish themselves in some (& not always so) small way =
through having won one. This is why I think Pierre Joris's comment about th=
em being scam affairs comes from a place of privilege. Although I respect a=
ll of the many years he=E2=80=99s put into poetry, teaching, translation, e=
tc., it's just not that easy, as Amish Trivedi notes, for a young poet to b=
reak into the scene. Yes, I'm an advocate for starting your own press and j=
ournal, both of which I did. But for folks not lucky enough to live in a ci=
ty with a large, active poetry community, or to study at a school like the =
University of Buffalo (as Richard did), with its instant community and fund=
ing for student-editing projects, it can be a daunting thing. Yes, creating=
 alterative market systems is one answer. I think we all think Sub Press is=
 pretty amazing. But the problem is much deeper than the tiny market
 systems of poetry. One can't up & move to NYC to be a poet these days with=
out being somehow independently wealthy. That wasn't always the case, tho.=
=20
=20
I just think the energy expended in arguing about this would be better dire=
cted into actual action. I mean if you're going to end your email, as Richa=
rd did, by bringing up inequality and injustice, aren't there other means t=
o more efficaciously address these issues?=20

Not one of us burns every one of our poems before letting anyone else read
them. We all have a little mud on us if we want to talk about careerism. And
purity is repulsive anyway.

Collectives and conversations with your peers start to look a lot like
cliques and cronyism if you have lousy social skills, particularly if those
social skills are affected by neurological differences. Oh, I know that's a
marginal concern but aren't the margins where distinctive writing happens
more often than not?

Hilary:

Wow. I wonder. The plural is kasten, but Duncan might not have known that. I
didn't know the dutch in its singular either (did Duncan?), which says
something about my ignorance speculating upon his putative same. How to deal
with a writer's ignorance is a subject worthy of several books, I'd think,
but what ignorant editor or professor who says s/he knows something can
protect the poet the poem and other readers from that knowing. So THANKS --
and the conundrum is still conundering.

Which means Duncan's work is, no doubt, endless in its demands -- but I can
live with walking away from itall once the deadline arrives. And that tells
you I'm getting a bit tiured of this project, look forward to other stuff so
do, and seem to be thriving.

Just finished the first of two longish-weekend visits from my son and his
children (aged 4 and 2) -- fun, but oh my, exhausting. And that tells you
we're both well, happy, busy -- and (oh dear) looking forward to the
grandchildren's return visit this weekend, before they fly home to Ottawa.
Good job the summer is, so far, generally cool enough to be pleasant rather
than too hot to be tolerable. BC is not Saskatchewan.

Best, yes indeed,

Hi Peter,

"kast" seems to be a Dutch word, for a sort of armoire that was taken up in
parts of America: see this link
http://www.artnet.com/magazine/features/garrett/garrett2-14-00.asp

I'm not sure whether "kasts" would be plural--don't know Dutch.

Hope you're well.

TO respond to Hugh's point:

That's a great point and, in fact, I do work with a group of poets here in
Philadelphia who have set up their own small presses, or put out small
limited editions of other poets just for fun, and set up readings for other
poets, and readings which celebrate presses that we admire or are fond of.
All of that certainly helps, so yr point is well taken. That still doesn't
address the point I made regarding how engaging in such communities can
still, very often, limit the aesthetic choices available to you (printing i=
n
color, paper quality) not to mention the fact that most of us are recent
college graduates or grad students who don't have the time to raise the
money to do more ambitious publishing projects because we have to work in
order to payoff ridiculous student loans and are already sacrificing sleep,
social lives, and sanity in order to do what little we can...we're not
"professional" poets who have institutional support; we're 20 somethings wh=
o
are already publishing our friends work, setting up readings, attending
readings, meeting to share and discuss work. The group that I work with, th=
e
New Philadelphia Poets, some of our members work 2 or 3 jobs, than have to
hussle to meetings where we set up a reading, or meet with a friend who's
putting out a chapbook by one of us, or go to a reading we've set up or tha=
t
we're performing in. Or for the reading series I help run, the 3 of us who
work on it work all week and then sacrifice most if not all of our Sunday t=
o
set up the bookstore where we hold it, run the reading and the open reading
which follows, and then clean up. And I swear I'm not complaining about it.
None of us. We all love poetry and art and music too much to bother
complaining. It's a source of joy in the midst of an otherwise workaday
existence. My point is, I suppose, we're already at the mercy of and subjec=
t
to capitalist exploitation in order to simply have the money to afford the
leisure time necessary to sustain our artistic lives. There's a real poetic
community in Philadelphia=97one of the most open and engaging in the countr=
y
I'd venture to say; but it's still difficult simply because most, though
admittedly not all, of the people I know in this community are not in a
position of economic privilege (due to student loans, or health concerns
combined with a lack of health insurance, or any of the other myriad social
problems) wherein they have the leisure time required to do what yr talking
about=97& even if they did the resources would still be limited.

I think you are correct in giving the word "submission" another connotation=
 (i.e. humility).=C2=A0 An apprentice by nature of being an apprentice is i=
n a process of learning her craft. Why not learn by submitting work (howeve=
r tentative).=C2=A0 Art requires great humility and great arrogance (in my =
humble opinion). Of course, I think there are many artists whose gifts put =
them in the category of linguistic savants; however, for most of us who beg=
an with "just" :) :) a passion for literature, writing, language, etc. it i=
s a craft that grows with experience and sometimes acknowledgment (dependin=
g on the person). I write because I love to write. Its always nice to get t=
hings published occasionally. Many of my young students express their ultim=
ate desire is to be published, but most students, (and I include myself in =
this), feel driven to say something, driven to tell their outside world som=
ething. I love that there are so many small presses now providing that
 service in whatever form they choose.=20

Get together with other young poets with similar ideas about poetry & poetics, and start your own magazine and small presses.

you don't use the door, you use the window, the skylight, the back door. What is this door anyway? leading to what? The House of Succesful Poets? Ain't no such abode. Of course if you mean the University's Creative Writing departments and your career move is to land a job there in order to pay the rent, that's different from being a poet who wants to write the best poetry she can.
>

Maybe the late sixties/seventies, when I came off age as a poet, were more politically radical, but it never entered my or my contemporaries' mind to get involved with any outfit, magazine or publisher, that smacked of reading period / paid submission / contest, what have you. In fact, thinking back, those kind of gimmicks didn't exist much, as they are to a great extent the invention of the MFA industry.
>

No (see first answer), work quietly or loudly wherever & however you work best, and then go make a loud noise in the streets. There probably is no quieter burial than to win the 20whatever $50whatever XXXPress Prize. You think you've achieved something (which will lure you into trying to repeat, thus imitating yourself) and everyone else knows what such prizes means & it will just be another hurdle for someone to read you straight.

Where do you want me to write from? Can't quit my job in a provincial =
upstate English department to answer you, really. Wouldn't know how to =
pay the rent. Been there for 18 years now, after 20+ freelancing, doing =
mimeo-mags, translating for peanuts or less, editing, teaching EFL, =
bartending, whatever. It is exactly because of that experience that I =
feel that I can speak to yours & Amish's posts, & that that's coming =
from a place of experience, not privilege.=20

> Although I respect all of the many years he=92s put into poetry, =
teaching, translation, etc., it's just not that easy, as Amish Trivedi =

It was never easy. It was actually even less easy back when as there was =
no poetry "scene" that offered careers =97 that came about in the =
eighties & nineties with the expansion of the MFA programs, with AWP, =
etc. One never thought one could make a living at poetry, one paid the =
rent with whatever job =97 & it would certainly not be poetry related =97 =
that came to hand. So the place of privilege would actually be today =
when there seem to be so much available possibilities =97 cf. the ads =
throughout every issue of AWP mag.=20

How much money does it take to get an MFA? Enough to live in NYC for the =
same amount of years & write poetry & find out if that is what one is =
good at and wants to spend one's life doing. That involves a risk of =
course =97but  the kind of risk any artist worth her salt needs to take. =
Of course if you find out that you are not very good or even any good at =
all at writing poetry while doing an MFA, you haven't really lost any of =
your investment, as you will get the degree anyhow and then can still go =
on & get a job teaching the writing of poetry for the next 40 years.

I think it is indeed worth arguing about, Noah, because it is exactly =
these questions that keep coming up while teaching or talking with young =
poets. They define in a certain way the political economy of the current =
situation in the US. (Poets anywhere else, from Paris to Timbuktu, =
Beijing to Sofia, would laugh out loud at the puny problems encountered =
by  well-fed, well-clothed young Norte Americanos bitching about not =
getting into some poetry "scene." The real place of privilege is this =
country.

btw, I admire Letter Machine Editions & your description of the economy =
of it in this post =97 important in fact to do that, explain it =
publicly. (In the seventies, in London, Allen Fisher would always have =
an page in the back of the books he published that would itemize the =
exact cost of the book & its relation to the number of copies printed =
and the price asked per copy.)

Dear all - I'm passing this on for a colleague but please do consider
submitting or please pass it on to anyone you think might be
interested in contributing!

best, Lori
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Breakthrough Nostalgia: Reading Steve McCaffery Then and Now

As Steve McCaffery approaches his mid-60s, his poetic and critical
output shows no signs of abating. Within the last decade, in fact,
McCaffery has produced five new collections of poetry, a new
collection of critical essays, and three volumes of selected material:
Seven Pages Missing Vols. 1 & 2, and Verse and Worse.
       Yet it has also been nearly 25 years since Open Letter=92s first
festschrift on McCaffery appeared, and both the critical community
surrounding McCaffery=92s work specifically, and of innovative writing
in general, has changed dramatically. Thus, this new issue of Open
Letter seeks to examine the changes in the reception of McCaffery=92s
work, as well has his own poetic development, over the last quarter
century.
       Intended as a continuum from the first collection of Open Letter
essays on McCaffery, this new gathering seeks critical essays (both
scholarly and experimental) on any aspect of McCaffery=92s criticism or
poetry (including sound, visual, and performance poetry), with a
particular interest in writing produced since 1990.
       Some points of departure, or lines of inquiry may include:

-       Reassessments of McCaffery early writing or analysis of recent writ=
ing
-       Is there a McCaffery canon? The significance of Teachable Texts,
Carnival, or The Black Debt?
-       McCaffery and digital poetics: his inclusion in Poems for the
Millennium Vol. 2 as a cyberpoet? Carnival: Panel 3 as his first
self-identified digital work?
-       McCaffery collaborations (TRG, Nichol, The Four Horsemen, Mac Corma=
ck)
-       McCaffery=92s contributions to theories of translation, sound poetr=
y,
or pataphysics
-       McCaffery=92s influence on writers, both younger and contemporary
-       The concept of nationality in McCaffery=92s career: his internation=
al
reputation or his interrogation of nationality in assessing
literature?
-       McCaffery and trans-historicism: making the new old, or making
the old new?
-       The critical and theoretical contributions of McCaffery to
literary debate

Priority will be given to critical writing on McCaffery=92s work, but
submissions of poetry or visuals inspired by, or related to the work
of, McCaffery will also be considered.

Please send proposals/ intentions/ ideas to Stephen Cain
<sjcain@yorku.ca> by October 1st, 2010. Complete work will be
requested by January 2011.

When *Eda*: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry edited by me was
published, among acknowledgments, I thanked my business at the time Murat
Oriental Rugs, Inc. for the financial sacrifices it had to make for the
writing of the book. I spent endless hours at my office working on the book=
,
neglecting my business. That is what it takes to be a poet. I wanted the
book to contain a record of that.

Ciao,

Murat

The one thing I'd add Pierre, when you address the relative costs of an MFA
compared to living in NYC for a similar number of years: The difference is
it's far easier to get a loan for an MFA from a bank, or some other
institution when yr a 20 something with no collateral and little to no
credit history (and if the statistics bear out, if you are a 20 something,
chances are yr credit history is awful) than it is to walk into a bank and
ask for a comparable loan in order to move to NYC and write poetry for two
years. Which isn't to say yr wrong, I agree with many of yr points in fact.
After all, fortune favors the brave and all that...still, as it was in the
60's and 70's I'm sure, there's a tremendous amount of volatility that come=
s
into play in the economic lives of younger poets now. We're extremely
vulnerable, especially if we've bought in to the MFA racket. They prey on
the sort of competition/prize fed homunculus which is bred inside of you
from Kindergarten on and on yr economic vulnerability. I feel like a lot of
kids of my generation (I'm 28) get sold into believing that the MFA route i=
s
the only economically viable route to becoming a writer. There's such an
emphasis on "professional" or "career" being the suffix to "writer". Hell, =
I
bought into it. I didn't attend an MFA, I got my Masters in Liberal Arts at
Penn (i certainly didn't get an interdisciplinary degree to advance my
career though...I did it because well...I like being a student, I like
learning...) but if there's one thing I've learned in my brief time trying
to participate in and grow WITH the scene here in Philadelphia it's that I
hope I stay an amateur forever. After all, the Latin route "amo" implies
love. If I ever stop loving poetry and it becomes PRIMARILY a career for me
(I still think it's a valid and admirable thing to spend yr life doing as a
vocation or even a professional vocation), I hope someone has the good sens=
e
and compassion to put me out of my misery.

While I appreciate the reservations many poets have about contest culture (=
especially after the whole Foetry thing a few years ago), and while there i=
s no doubt that there are outfits out there taking improper advantage of th=
at culture, I don't think ALL small presses out there running contests have=
 dubious motives--in fact, I run two awards myself at Firewheel (the Senten=
ce Book Award and the Firewheel Chapbook Award) in addition to publishing S=
entence and unsolicited book manuscripts. I'm sure many other folks on this=
 list who aren't speaking up run contests and awards as well.

First, many (most?) small presses are run as nonprofits on an entirely volu=
nteer basis. Many of them, like Noah's press and like Firewheel was when I =
first started, are run mostly out of the editor's pocket, without support f=
rom a university and without NEA or state grant moneys. So to imply that th=
ese presses somehow are pouring contest money into their editors' own pocke=
ts simply isn't the case in most instances. The funds from contest fees, if=
 there is any left after publication of the winning title, is poured back i=
nto other titles, which the press would be unable to publish without those =
funds. So there actually is an element of the co-op in many of these small =
presses; I would hope that entrants in such contests actually KNOW the pres=
ses to which they are sending their work and can take some satisfaction in =
knowing that if they themselves are not offered publication, they are suppo=
rting a press they admire and helping that press to publish other worthy wo=
rk. Isn't that what a co-op is?

The Firewheel Chapbook Award, for example, is dedicated to publishing work =
that is difficult to place for publication due to format, typography, whate=
ver reason. Our last publication was a box with cover art and loose leaf pr=
inted pages, Marjorie Tesser's poem/game _The important thing is..._. I wou=
ld hope that the folks who entered and whom we did not publish feel that th=
ey contributed to the publication of Marjorie's title, because they did. It=
 wouldn't have happened without them. The Sentence Book Award, which is dev=
oted to prose poetry, appeals to a specific audience who form a kind of co-=
op in expressing their support for their fellow prose poets, for Sentence a=
nd for Firewheel with their entries. Is there really a difference between s=
ending an entry fee to a publisher you admire and sending a small donation?

Maybe one would argue that no publisher should be publishing who can't affo=
rd to do so without the contest structure. One might argue that there are t=
oo many books anyway and these contests are publishing work that aren't wor=
thy of publication. And my response would be to challenge you to read Marjo=
rie's _The important thing is..._ or Catherine Sasanov's _Had Slaves_ and s=
ee if you still feel that way--I'm sure the same applies to many award-winn=
ing books that I didn't publish as well...

If Firewheel ever is successful enough (that is, has enough ongoing sales o=
f existing titles) to support these awards without fees, then we will run t=
hem for free or cease the awards and just publish more books that come over=
 the transom, that would be great! Just as we'd love to be able to pay all =
of our contributors gobs of money every time we print their work in Sentenc=
e. But until that time, we feel like we're providing a service to a certain=
 audience by doing things the way we do them. And it sure as hell hasn't gi=
ven me any kind of career boost, I can tell you that! What it has done for =
me personally, though, is give me an opportunity to get to know many excell=
ent people who are interested in building respectful relationships through =
books, journals, and poems.

Just an idea:  as list after list descends into exchanges of marketing info.
or announcements of products and events that are part of our culture of
mini-celebrity, and now that facebook and blogs are also going that way,
perhaps it might be time to return to critical/aesthetic debates?

For example, I haven't replied to Adam's post because I think it might be
more appropriate for me to write (as I mention on my blog, which I don't
"market" -- I made it as a sort of blog in 2002? when? that isn't in the
direction blogging went -- ) a more positively-positioned summary of my
ideas about how the ideas of soul and spirit might be entirely inappropriate
for poetry -- but because this list was so contentious in the past, also,
there's no way I could really post what I think here.

Maybe there's a new way?  Something more descriptive and anecdotal, less
like the poetry we write?

To write poetry is to be on the margins, but to write experimental poetry,
more so, and to spend most of the days and nights locked outside of both the
academic/critical realm and the mainstream poetry realm is painful, and to
have a different aesthetic -- or even be in a different place in life, or to
be tired of "building a following" -- from the local poetry coteries -- is
painful as well.  And within experimental poetry. I know for me, the lists
were a balm at one time.  I was so isolated, working as a manager for
institutions squandering billions of dollars and creating the recessions.
Including schools:  isn't it great that art resists professionalism?  The
familiar? Isn't it nice to be able to see when a work is really vacuous and
another is really interesting?  That unlike composition, creative writing
remains relevant to the way people have to communicate after their last
paper is due?  That arts, criticism, and theory is the last revenge of the
amateur?

As Richard's email was in response to the announcement I'd posted here, =
I can't help but take his comment about the lack of editorial acumen as =
personal, even if it included the "more often that not" caveat. Subito =
Press was founded at the University of Colorado-Boulder by my colleague =
Elisabeth Sheffield. It's not "my" press. I was simply passing on an =
announcement about it. Like Richard, I've been frustrated in the past by =
what I perceived of as a dearth of uninteresting work being brought into =
the world. But rather than grip about it, I decided, along with a friend =
to found a press (http://www.lettermachine.org/catalog.html) that would =
function as a sort of polemic, where our books would collectively make =
an argument for what we see as representative of the work being done =
that is wholly valuable for the state of (& future of) the art.=20

Letter Machine Editions does not have a contest. We did, however, have =
an open reading period recently, one where we asked for $10. For this =
$10, we offered to mail any title from our backlist to whomever =
submitted. The cost of a mailing envelop is around one dollar. The cost =
to mail the book is about two dollars. The actual cost per book, the =
amount we pay to publish each book, including all fees, shipping, =
charges to list the book with SPD, designer fees, etc. ranges from about =
$4 to $8 per book (our full-length titles are offset pressed, not =
digit), for a total cost of from $7 to $11 dollars. This is to say we =
are not making money off of our reading fees, rather we're getting our =
books out into the world and getting a chance to see work by folks we =
might not otherwise see. I've personally already gone over $5,000 into =
debt, and had to open up new credit cards, just to fund this press. Not =
for some sort of careerist gain, but because I believe in the books =
we=92re publishing & want to see them move into the world.=20
=20
That said, I realize that the initial response to my email was more of =
an attack on the contest system. Yes, I also think it has its faults. =
But no, I don't think those poet who've won contests really care all =
that much about the contest itself. It's more of a means to simply get =
the work into the world. I mean, even John Latta, who commented here is =
a book contest winner. Here are a few more off the top of my head:=20
=20
Nathaniel Mackey
Juliana Spahr
Cole Swensen
Elizabeth Willis
John Ashbery
Rodrigo Toscano
Ange Mlinko
Joshua Clover
Ed Roberson
John Yau
Laura Mullen
Graham Foust
Jena Osman
Laynie Browne
Eleni Sikelianos
Elizabeth Robinson
=20
Maybe these people would shun contest now, but that's because they've =
had the opportunity to establish themselves in some (& not always so) =
small way through having won one. This is why I think Pierre Joris's =
comment about them being scam affairs comes from a place of privilege. =
Although I respect all of the many years he=92s put into poetry, =
teaching, translation, etc., it's just not that easy, as Amish Trivedi =
notes, for a young poet to break into the scene. Yes, I'm an advocate =
for starting your own press and journal, both of which I did. But for =
folks not lucky enough to live in a city with a large, active poetry =
community, or to study at a school like the University of Buffalo (as =
Richard did), with its instant community and funding for student-editing =
projects, it can be a daunting thing. Yes, creating alterative market =
systems is one answer. I think we all think Sub Press is pretty amazing. =
But the problem is much deeper than the tiny market systems of poetry. =
One can't up & move to NYC to be a poet these days without being somehow =
independently wealthy. That wasn't always the case, tho.=20
=20
I just think the energy expended in arguing about this would be better =
directed into actual action. I mean if you're going to end your email, =
as Richard did, by bringing up inequality and injustice, aren't there =
other means to more efficaciously address these issues?=20

 On Thursday=2C July 22=2C WE-ARE-FAMILIA Gallery will host a
gathering of flarf poets. Flarf is an international avant-garde poetry move=
ment
of the late 20th century / early 21st century whose 30+ practitioners explo=
re
=93the inappropriate=94 in all of its guises. Their method is to mine the I=
nternet
with odd search terms then distill the results into often hilarious and
sometimes disturbing poems=2C plays=2C and other texts. Recently profiled o=
n the
front page of The Wall Street Journal=2C the flarf collective create hilari=
ous=2C
shocking=2C and sometimes downright offensive works. Heated discussions abo=
ut
flarf have been broadcast by the BBC and National Public Radio=2C and publi=

in The Village Voice=2C The Nation=2C Poetry=2C Poets & Writers=2C and The =
Wall

=96whatever
you think flarf is=96=96it is most definitely the 21st century=91s first po=

 Gordon (Folly)=2C Gary Sullivan
(PPL In A Depot)=2C Brandon Downing (Lake

Gardner (Petroleum Hat).


WE-ARE-FAMILIA is an extensive global network of creative
individuals from all disciplines who have come together to explore the
powerful=2C complex ties which consciously and unconsciously touch all that=
 we
experience as humans. Spearheaded by Creative Director Jennifer Garcia=2C t=

primary ongoing project is a series of 25 one-of-a-kind Keepsake Boxes
showcasing original =93mementos=94 engaging the con...cept of family.

WE-ARE-FAMILIA=2C with help from sponsors Art Assets=2C Atlantic
Assets=2C and GFI Realty=2C have recently transformed a raw=2C formerly vac=

storefront on Atlantic Avenue into an open studio where they will continue
assembling new Keepsake Boxes including a special commission for the Museum=
 of
Art and Design. The space additionally functions as a gallery to exhibit ne=
w
works by Keepsake Box contributors as well as a free event space which aims=
 to
extend their family dialogue. The space opened its doors on June 11th=2C 20=

I think there is no need for pitting established poets vs.
unestablished poets, MFA/AWP generation vs. pre-MFA/AWP generation.
First of all, the latter learn everything they know from the former,
and the former may learn new things from the latter. Second, in a
slightly larger picture, we are all pretty insignificant and
powerless. That fact might be the underlying reason why there is so
much frustration, and why it seems we're fighting over crumbs on the
table.

But when you look at who celebrities and powerful people are nowadays,
being so deep in the shadow must mean we're doing something right.
Think about it. On the one hand, we are left alone by the powers that
be. On the other hand, there are resources available to keep writing,
reading, publishing, and sharing work. These resources may be mere
crumbs on the table, but they do. (James Franco, stay away from our
crumbs! Actually, no, throw us a loaf of bread! ;-))

Nana Zabic

P.S. I can write about how we (grad students who founded and run the
journal) raise money for Packingtown Review, and how we spend it, and
how our university affiliation works, if anyone is interested. Long
story short, it takes a lot of time and effort to raise the money; no
silver spoons in sight. As far as other policies, we do use the word
"submission," we read year-round, we have a system to prevent nepotism
(I can provide details about that too), we ran one contest in the
past, which didn't charge fees, but offered no cash prize either, we
might have fee+prize contest in the future...

P.P.S. Sometimes it costs almost nothing to get an MFA and a Ph.D. You
get a tuition waiver, a TA-ship, live very modestly, and scramble for
a summer job. There are all kinds of scenarios, though, it's hard to
generalize.

New from Chax Press: Mark Weiss, As Landscape.
$16.  Order from http://www.chax.org/poets/weiss.htm


"What a beautiful set of circumstances! What a=20
lovely concatenation of particulars. Here is the=20
poet alive in every sense of the word, and=20
through every one of his senses. Instead of=20
missing a beat or a part, Weiss' fragments are=20
like Chekhov's short stories-the more that gets=20
left out, the more they seem to contain... One can=20
hear echoes from all the various=20
ancestors...[but] the voice, at its center, its=20
core, is pure Mark Weiss. His use of the fragment=20
is both elegant and bafflingly clear, a pure=20
musical threnody...[it] opens a window, not only=20
into a mind, but a person, a personality, this=20
human figure at the emotional center of the poem."

Adam-many thanks for your sharing the essay--

a thought:  historically=2C the USA is a nation based on spirtiuality & mat=
erialism being intimately interrelated ("In God We Trust" on the money--)

also my sense of Marxist readings by poets in the US has been it is not ver=
y well thought through=2C not well enough read in the original writings of =
both the "Early/Romantic" Marx and the later "Scientific" Marx--
as well as the "Traditions of Modern Leftism" including Situationism--
Marx is an excellent writer--i wish i read German much better!!--many passa=
ges of poetry in his works even in the French and English editions i have r=
ead--
i have been corresponding with a fellow Russian Sound/Visual/Asemic poet wh=
o is a fanatic abt the  place of philosphy in the face of the hells of the =
current world--
like many he has taken the route laid out--there are many--by Gilles Deleuz=
e--

a problem facing language used in the USA today is that of "Torture:  Cance=
r of Democracy" as a great book on France-Algeria 1944-62 by Pierre Vidal-N=
aquet calls it--
and the Orwellian demands of language used in order to accommodate support =
for Apartheid --

with the Taoist Chung Tzu  ("Look under your feet!")-- and my ancestors her=
e tens of thousands of years in the Americas i wd say we have lost the sens=
e of the ground beneath our feet--of the Earth--
when we begin to lose the Mother--we see it every day what is happening--fr=
om the oil spill to everywhere any town usa--

often the thing in front of one is the lesson to be learned from

thank you again--
onwo/ards!!

I hope someone is recording this exchange and will make it into a book. Th=
is has been a fascinating and anguished discussion of the vocation, just l=
ike the plight of visual artists.=0A=0AMy trajectory is a bit like Pierre'=
s, but with less publication: a journal here, an odd anthology there, occa=
sional readings, a growing pile of poems to be put into some retrospective=
 volume (after 50 years of writing poetry). And income from a separate car=
eer (teaching French). =EF=BB=BF=0A=0AIn some ways, my participation in th=
e Lettriste artist group in France has been the most rewarding: group show=
s, monthly meetings in Paris (when I could make it) and occasional publica=
tion of my works (their imprint, my expense).=0A=0AThe only thing I can of=
fer is the familiar exhortation: just do it. Today I saw a video of downhi=
ll skateboarders, who put up their hay bales and let it fly. Poets, do the=
 same. Just let it fly. Some of us will be discovered 50 years after our d=
eath; meanwhile, leave some traces.=0A=0ADavid=0A=0ADavid W. Seaman, Ph.D.=

The 'Rencontres Internationales' offers more than a simple presentation of the works. It introduces an intercultural forum gathering various guests from all over the world - artists and filmmakers, institutions and emerging organizations - to testify of their reflections and their experiences, but also of artistic and cultural contexts that are often undergoing deep changes.
The 'Rencontres Internationales' reflects specificities and convergences of artistic practices between new cinema and contemporary art, explores emerging media art practices and their critical purposes, and makes possible a necessary time when points of view meet and are exchanged.
The event aims at presenting works to a broad audience, at creating circulations between different art practices and between different audiences, as well as creating new exchanges between artists, filmmakers and professionals.
It seeks to contribute to a reflection on our contemporary culture of image via a compelling program opened to everyone..

PARIS/BERLIN/MADRID
In 2007, the Rencontres Internationales, which initially took place in Paris and Berlin, opened up to a third city: Madrid. The event constitutes a unique artistic and cultural platform in Europe for artists, professional networks and various audiences. The venues in the three cities are in particular the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, the Reina Sofia National Museum and the Spanish Cinematheque in
Madrid.

Hi everyone,

My new book, Architectonic Conjectures, just came out from Silenced
Press (http://silencedpress.com/).

The organizing principle behind =93Architectonic Conjectures=94 is that
we begin our lives unconsciously in fully formed homes, abstract the
architectural structure from the built environment, and finally move
out into the ethical world of the city.  Therefore, there are three
main sections, one about homes ("From the Bedroom to the Living Room
and Back Again") one investigating architecture proper
("Architexture"), and a third investing the city ("Urbanities").

You can order it here:
http://silencedpress.com/

thanks so much
peace out
Francis

especially grateful to Pierre, Lisa & Gloria & others for sharing their com=
ments & insights. when Pierre points back to his London years, with Allen F=
isher & others, i think it wld serve _all_ of us well to consider what was =
happening then, how poets were working and, perhaps *most* importantly, wha=
t issues concerned them. Allen Fisher's long running mag Spanner provides u=
s w/ an _invaluable_ model for cultural production -- as do any other numbe=
r of mags that circulated from the mimeo era thru the xerox era in the US &=
 Britain.=A0=20

like Osama sz: ask not what a press can do for you; ask what presses are do=
ing. viz. there ain't no omniscient poetry cardinal or congressman behind a=
 curtain of power, at least not one qualified enough to name "good" or "gre=
at" work. & it's not like _anyone_ at this stage has a clear meta-sense of =
what productive work is or shld be. meaningful work is situation & communit=
y specific.=20

ANY press that shakes young poets down for a reading fee FORECLOSES on its =
own relevance. they are to be ignored. NO exceptions. NO compromise.=A0 =A0=

NOTA: tho i have *deep* reservations re flarf as effective practice (i've a=
ddressed this elsewhere), i have the *deepest* admiration for flarf as a wi=
ldly frustrated, cavalier & incredibly productive riposte to usurous po ind=
ustry practices. flarf first announces itself _thru_ the figure of poetry c=
ontests.=C2=A0=20

Cf. Sullivan on the emergence of flarf:

"A couple of years ago, if you'll remember, on the Women's Poetry list, =0A=
        a number of people began posting in horror at finding their =0Aname=
s, with =0A        poems they hadn't written, on poetry.com. I remember goi=
ng to =0Athe site =0A        and realizing immediately it was one of those =
"poetry contest" =0A        scams. A year or so before that I had spoken on=
 the phone with =0Amy grandfather, =0A        not many days before he died,=
 and he had told me then how proud =0Ahe was =0A        that he had won som=
e sort of poetry contest, and that he had =0Aordered the =0A        book, e=
tc. I had always felt bad about that, and once I was on =0Athe poetry.com =
=0A        site, I wrote what I thought would be the most offensive poem I =
=0Acould =0A        manage, and submitted it to the "contest":
=0A       =20
=0A        Mm-hmm
=0A        Yeah, mm-hmm, it's true
=0A        big birds make
=0A        big doo! I got fire inside
=0A        my "huppa"-chimp(TM)
=0A        gonna be agreessive, greasy aw yeah god
=0A        wanna DOOT! DOOT!
=0A        Pffffffffffffffffffffffffft! hey!
=0A        oooh yeah baby gonna shake & bake then take
=0A        AWWWWWL your monee, honee (tee hee)
=0A        uggah duggah buggah biggah buggah muggah
=0A        hey! hey! you stoopid Mick! get
=0A        off the paddy field and git
=0A        me some chocolate Quik
=0A        put a Q-tip in it and stir it up sick
=0A        pocka-mocka-chocka-locka-DING DONG
=0A        fuck! shit! piss! oh it's so sad that
=0A        syndrome what's it called tourette's
=0A        make me HAI-EE! shout out loud
=0A        Cuz I love thee. Thank you God, for listening!
=0A       =20
=0A        To my amazement, I received, about three weeks later, a letter =
=0Afrom poetry.com, =0A        with my poem fully visible through the cello=
phane window of the =0Aenvelope. =0A        The letter, in part, read:
=0A       =20
=0A        "Gary, over the past year, we have conducted an exhaustive =0Aex=
amination =0A        of over 1.2 million poems that have been submitted to =
us. Only a=0A small =0A        percentage of individuals whose poems we hav=
e reviewed were =0Aselected to =0A        be part of this distinguished pro=
ject. "'Mm-hmm' was selected =0Afor =0A        publication because it spark=
s the imagination and provides the =0Areader =0A        with a fresh, uniqu=
e perspective on life. We believe it will add=0A to the =0A        importan=
ce and appeal of this special edition. _Of course, Gary,=0A as always, =0A =
       you are under no obligation whatsoever to submit any entry fee =0Aor=
 subsidy =0A        payment, or to make a purchase of any kind_. Your poem =
will be =0Apresented =0A        in the most elegant way possible. This coff=
ee-table quality book=0A will =0A        feature an 'Arristock leather' cov=
er stamped in gold and a satin=0A bookmarker =0A        =E2=80=A6"
=0A       =20
=0A        And it went on like that. I can't remember if I said anything =
=0Aabout this =0A        on the Women's Poetry list (I might have unsubscri=
bed by then), =0Abut I =0A        was on the subpoetics list at the time, a=
nd posted something =0Aabout it, =0A        and encouraged others to submit=
 poems to poetry.com. There were a=0A few =0A        takers, including Kase=
y Mohammad and maybe Drew Gardner. =0AMeanwhile, Nada, =0A        Mitch Hig=
hfill and I began writing more of these awful poems, =0Aand submitting =0A =
       them to the site under a variety of different names.=20
=0A       =20
=0A        Somewhere in all of this, the word "flarf" materialized-it may =
=0A        have been Mitch's word, or Drew's, or Nada's, I'm not sure. But =
=0Asomehow, =0A        "flarf" began to take on a meaning: "having the qual=
ity =0A        of flarfiness." We now began to look at other things and to =
see =0Athem =0A        as "flarfy." I was never 100% sure what it meant-som=
ething akin =0A        to "campy," but with somewhat different resonances. =
More =0Aawkward, =0A        stumbling, "wrong" than camp. The flarf "voice"=
 in =0A        my head was that of my father, a transplanted southerner, wh=
o =0Alikes to =0A        pontificate, and who has a lot of opinions that ki=
nd of horrify =0Ame."=20

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CA Year of Ordinary Moments=
=E2=80=9D by Rich Curtis
Description:
As a performance art piece, Rich Curtis became a licensed notary public in =
2009. Since that time he has notarized many things, none of which have been=
 legal documents. Curtis is fascinated by the idea of being legally bound t=
o TRUTH. His personal view that truth is inherently subjective runs counter=
 to the notion of a legal and absolute truth. As part of this project he de=
vised an exercise of witnessing one true thing each day. For the most part =
Curtis tried to pick the most obscure, least significant event of a given d=
ay. He distilled each of these moments into one sentence. The result of thi=
s is =E2=80=9CA Year of Ordinary Moments=E2=80=9D, where the body of the te=
xt is the result of his daily observations.
Available as a free ebook here:

Hi, Adam,

My new book of poetry *The Spiritual Life of Replicants*, to be published by
Talisman Books this fall, deals exactly with the themes you mention.

Ciao,

Just passing this along regarding my friend Lily's beautiful book:

My publisher is promoting my book with a great discount of 15%.
If you or anyone you know is interested in purchasing a new book of poetry,
the promotion code is attached below.
Please note, this book is downloadable for e-readers as well.

ons should not only be judged by how many books one has read
but also by one what has seen -
and to me if you are indeed a POET or come close to being THAT THING
you should be dealing with your SELF your WORK through that axiom

this is a subject that has irked plagued etc me  my life my work for many
years
no mfa's no addressses  to look up  a native new yorker surrpounded by
the scene and never realizing til the 80's there
was a SCENE - and in that scene many little splintered scenses- and it's
all about schmoozing and who you know
manners or lack of... games  etc...
contests  mfa's prizes  i won a contest once so???  nada
3 years ago a small pen award???   so  ??? no publisher  ( and a good one
to back me up) nada
in 80's not haing academia behind me - not kissing ass (which i sometines
at nearly 65 do a bit better now- tho am still a clumsy oaf _spelling?)
i realized i had to do it myself and i did what i initilly hated and did
poorly i read in public tho avoided open mics and horrid venues

this list is still basically full of amcademes and folks who followed a
paper trial to get where they are and folks who know what they know
thru books  classes CLASS  etc .. pierre had a plan it worked he followed
all the trails - to his place of PRIVELEGE
i would take  moxley's remark a step further  "Publication, popularity,
and prizes. All three are unreliable

STOP WITH THIS STUFF "IF WE ARE DEEP IN THE SHADOWS WE MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT"
THAT IS MERE CHRIST COMPLEX POESIE CRAP - IF WE ARE AT ALL WORTHY SOME
WILL RISE THO MOSTLY ONLY
THE SH**T FLOATS  - AND IF WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO STEP OUT OF THE SHADOWS
OUR WORK CAN BE SEEN BY A LARGER AUDIENCE (THO STILL QUITE SMALL) PERHAPS
APPRECIATED AND MAYBE WE CAN HELP EVEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY (THO I AM A
SKEPTIC IN SUCH MATTERS) TO MOVE PEOPLE AND MAKE MINOR POSITIVE
ALTERATIONS IN THE CRACKS---  i'm sure everyone on this list knows of or
knows personally someone of wot=rth who has risen ever so slightly out of
the shadows  even if only to receive the acknowledgement they deserve by
our small rather fragmented community

i also agree with mark on some points and pierre tho not on all points
we can't get notoriety etc just on the services we perform  tho i can
name many wo's work (which is medicre)
have climbed up the proverbial ladder on that and then the work gets
focusded on after
same with teacher/student relationships  -  wow hot gonna take a dip
and cash a check for a poet's job well done

Dear Jennifer,

I noted, with great interest, your Unnatural Acts in Los Angeles posting.
The 8-hour writing experiments of 1972-73, as documented in Unnatural Acts
magazine, were terrific, exhausting, wondrous, and horrifying. I love that
you=B9re going to do a new version of them.

Please feel free to mention me when you credit Unnatural Acts as your
inspiration. You credit =B3Bernadette Mayer and others.=B2 I don=B9t begrudge
Bernadette getting star billing; she is one of the great poets and teachers
of our time. What could (and perhaps should) be said is that Bernadette and
I were coeditors of Unnatural Acts, and that we were _both_ fundamentally
involved in the formulation, execution, and publication of those 1972-73
experiments.=20

Thanks,

Ed Friedman

P.S. I look forward to reading what you and your collaborators come up with=
.

Rich--I love you and I tend to trust your assessment here, but seriously:

"ANY press that shakes young poets down for a reading fee FORECLOSES on its
own relevance. they are to be ignored. NO exceptions. NO compromise."

Walk it back, man. No Salt? No Kelsey St. (I think they had a fee recently,
though this might be wrong)? No Ahsahta? No Omnidawn? No Nightboat? This is
a major erasure. I don't think I need to list individual titles here to mak=
e
that point. Probably missing a few in my list, but my sense is that there
are presses out there doing seriously fucking viable work on that model (or
in spite of it).

No way for a more complicated take on this? I wonder if we might hear from
any of the folks associated w/any of the presses above on their choice to
run contests and/or charge reading fees.

Mark,

Ouch. :-) But still, I'm proud of you. I dunno, I think it's also
great that there is some funding for artists or wannabe artists, even
if it's in a grad school format, whether it's for (wannabe) poets,
film makers, visual artists, etc.

not sure if you've followed recent conversations re Salt, but, man -- well,=
 take another look. i know at last half a dozen younger poets that publishe=

Rich--I love you and I tend to trust your assessment here, but seriously:

"ANY press that shakes young poets down for a reading fee FORECLOSES on its
own relevance. they are to be ignored. NO exceptions. NO compromise."

Walk it back, man. No Salt? No Kelsey St. (I think they had a fee recently,
though this might be wrong)? No Ahsahta? No Omnidawn? No Nightboat? This is
a major erasure. I don't think I need to list individual titles here to mak=
e
that point. Probably missing a few in my list, but my sense is that there
are presses out there doing seriously fucking viable work on that model (or
in spite of it).

No way for a more complicated take on this? I wonder if we might hear from
any of the folks associated w/any of the presses above on their choice to
run contests and/or charge reading fees.

Steve,

I hear you. Major OUCH. But I can't stop, that's what I feel, though I
think you totally misunderstood me. I'm gladly as far away from Christ

of god and a virgin, and around whom a major religion was created etc.

I think that reading and reading poetry is very important in learning how t=
o write poetry. I also think that learning how to write poetry by simply wr=
iting it is the way to becoming a poet.=20

I did not have the chance to get an MFA for several different reasons. Now =
I am glad that I didn't have that chance. I do have an MA in English, and I=
 teach freshman composition. I would not want to teach creative writing; th=
at I know.=20

I feel very ambivalent about the poetry community, maybe because I am physi=
cally removed from it.I don't hang out with other poets. I do think that I =
will continue writing, even though I often have moments when I wonder why I=
 put so much of my energy into my writing. I also have these moments of cla=
rity when I wonder why I write. I suppose that I continue to write poetry b=
ecause find it an interesting way to understand myself.I also understand th=
at sometimes I need affirmation--I need to get published so that I feel tha=
t my poetry has some merit--but maybe it really doesn't. I don't know.

The bottom line is that poetry can be a profound way of expression, and we =
do play lots of silly games that have nothing to do with the real importanc=
e of poetry.

the last missive i launched went to the list but was intended as a private =
msg.=20

but to consider yr comment in a more public -- & more measured -- way, Chri=
s, i'd say if we are to insist on the relevance of presses that participate=
 in questionable practices, if we are not to ignore them, then we need to p=
ut pressure on them to develop different models for generating dough, locat=
ing new (younger) poets, etc -- viz. call these presses out on requests for=
 reading fees, critique the deep logic that makes contests appear inviting =
& desirable. man, contests really are a filthy way to generate cash. both y=
ou & i, along with any number of others on this list, well recognize how fa=
r a nice chunk of change can go re making bks, but there are ways of genera=
ting that kind of cash without creating an environment that motivates young=
 poets to produce work _toward_ an idea of winning (which always presuppose=
s losers), or _toward_ an idea of success, or _toward_ an idea of "breaking=
 onto" a Free-Mason-like poetry scene as tho it were Hollywood.=C2=A0 =C2=
=A0
 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=20

man, i have the deepest respect for yr work -- LRL, Dos Press, etc -- & thi=
s is work that, i think like my own, doesn't participate in the practices i=
'm taking issue with here. & i see yr point re bracketing out important wri=
ting by good presses that happen also to organize contests, etc. but i rema=
in convinced that the contest model (and, with it, the language of submissi=
on) cannot be modified, reformulated or recuperated -- it has to be tossed.=

Rich--I love you and I tend to trust your assessment here, but seriously:

"ANY press that shakes young poets down for a reading fee FORECLOSES on its
own relevance. they are to be ignored. NO exceptions. NO compromise."

Walk it back, man. No Salt? No Kelsey St. (I think they had a fee recently,
though this might be wrong)? No Ahsahta? No Omnidawn? No Nightboat? This is
a major erasure. I don't think I need to list individual titles here to mak=
e
that point. Probably missing a few in my list, but my sense is that there
are presses out there doing seriously fucking viable work on that model (or
in spite of it).

No way for a more complicated take on this? I wonder if we might hear from
any of the folks associated w/any of the presses above on their choice to
run contests and/or charge reading fees.

To try another tactic:  why write if not to do everything possible to
increase one's knowledge, to make shiny poems, and to communicate?  Isn't
education a catalyst as much as experience?

How else to seek a wider audience through publication than to find
publishers with similar opinions about poetry?  How better to engage with
the community of writers than to curate reading series, publish others,
teach, review, be an example in some way to younger writers?  [I just saw
the Telephone Press chap by Patti Smith at the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame!]

What are these opinions about poetry?  How are they changing 1) because it
is easier and cheaper to reach an audience, 2) because we all, to a certain
extent, survived the poetry wars more recently than we received our
inheritance from the Beats, the art-poets, the langpos?

Is it so stupid to want to teach?  To be a good teacher AND critic AND
writer?  To not spend an extended period in "post-college living at its
finest"? I like what Lisa said about working from within the academic
community, where somehow peer review has morphed into winning prizes, but
only in the arts, because spirituality knows, there's no peer review in the
arts : 0  Aren't the more experimental poets who teach pretty rockin'?
 Teaching's pretty easy and fun compared to making widgets for boneheads.
 Plus, the job involves mentoring other writers, which is hard to do in a
peer-to-peer community model of poetry.

Oh, and we were all teaching about poetry.com, including entering bad poems
and discussing what's "bad" to show about it, looong before flarf.  Out here
in the boonies.

ha  cute flarf an extract in a way of cutup methods

should be noted however most flarfers were / are fairly established
already as poets
so silly experimenting isn't too risky for them at this point in history

The current issue of Rain Taxi has a long two full page review of a book to
which two Poetics/spidertanglers contributed

--especially Maria Damon, co-editor of what is in many ways the first
anthology of its kind (in the usa--at least--if not anywhere--))--
Poetry and Cultural Studies--A Reader
edited by Maria and Ira Livingston
Urbana &Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2009
(appeared end of that year--)
Maria contributed a wonderful essay--"Tell Them about Us:  Some Poems from
Southie
(South Boston, of course!!--)
Maria invited me to contribute a Visual Poetry piece she had chosen for the
cover--
"Be Poem/Poem Being"--
for which i deeply thank her and also the great work on the overall cover
design by Cope Copenhaver-
a great pleasure and honor to work with Maria and Cope both and my deepest
thanks

Rich, Chris,

Like others I have found this conversation rather interesting but like a fe=
w here, Chris especially, I'd like YOU to offer what you might see as a pol=
itically responsible publishing model. To be blunt--what is the source of f=
unding for damn the caesars? I know lots of people who use their own funds =
and state grants to support their presses but those models--siphoning capit=
al--presuppose participation in a labor market and government subsidy model=
 that has its own, shall we say, political problems...I concur completely w=
ith the winners/losers model re contests though I can't imagine many partic=
ipants think of it that way (I won! I lost!). Don't they, as I do, see it s=
imply as a way to support small presses and, as one commentator suggested, =
don't come way with a "loser" noose hung around their necks (or minds)? And=
, here's my real point, if they Do participate in the psychological game of=
 winners and losers, not participating in contests will in no way affect th=
at mindset. I understand your critique of the business model that facilitat=
es such thinking but you seem to be critiquing the end result of such think=
ing--what about such thinking per se?

Tyrone

In regard to Fieled's posting, below: In Joyce's letters to Grant Richards,
when he's trying to get Dubliners published and fighting against the
censorship of certain common though blasphemous words, he says something

so, typically for this list, we've moved from questioning the culture of
prizes -- which in most cases are a sort of poetry raffle, but have become a
trophy to brandish at hiring and tenure committees -- to saying that 1)
people shouldn't work for money to subsidize their practice, 2) teachers
shouldn't get paid, 3) creative writing shouldn't be taught

and this is communicated in the actual work?

Dear Rich, (& Tyrone, Noah et al)--I think the reason I chimed in here was
that I don't see the absence of contests or reading fees as inherently more
responsible than otherwise. I think Noah spoke to this (& much else) pretty
candidly above, as did Tyrone, as have others.

Specifically, I think it'd be worth addressing how presses that build their
lists primarily through solicitation & publish out of pocket (or through
grant money or some other institutional funding source) *can easily
replicate* the basic economy of the version of the contest model that
deserves critique, where resumes and connections are eventually a bottom
line. Can replicate that economy even when they want to push against it.
Publishing might generally move towards establishing a standard of
legitimacy, even if only as a result of the thinking Tyrone's pointing out
that precedes the contest model or has a life outside of that model.

For my own part (and I imagine for many other folks in this conversation),
the publishing I value takes upon itself the effort to resist that
movement--to open up alternatives, to add possibilities for prosody rather
than foreclosing on them, to *politicize* publication in that way--but we
might admit that it never fully escapes a relation to that economy.
Especially if it has a strong aesthetic affiliation, even just a clear idea
of where things need to be opened up. That is, a press encourages this
"writing toward" by virtue of its own activity, it seems to me--contest or
no. I know there's a difference between a well received intervention in a
discourse & a well received entry in a contest, but it just seems like
stopping short of really examining this thing to say that it's all the faul=
t
of how the funds are gathered or that the former doesn't involve endorsing =
a
measure for success.

I think Tyrone's totally right to point out that funding sources can be an
ugly game even in the public/institutional sphere. For that matter, even in
the pass-the-plate sphere, even in the publishing collective sphere. My
sense, Rich, is that your call is (in part) for a rigidly activist
publishing--which I admire greatly. I guess I just don't see how or why tha=
t
activism should adopt a "no compromise" stance in relation to other presses=
'
efforts, especially if it's meant as a gesture towards collectivist work.
"No compromise" in the interest of what, exactly? I mean, if the question
here is how to do ethical publishing (and in the end I'm not entirely
certain that's the question you seem to be posing--or at least there's a
demand for "legit" publishing or some as-yet-unnamed x-factor that's
seriously competing w/the ethical demand), then "no compromise" is a pretty
dangerous misstep.

Hugs (more hugs after all!--it always cracks me up that you close this way =
&
I wanted to return the sentiment, sincerely),
Chris

I'm not sure about this idea of America and spirituality -- we certainly are
far more religious (i.e. participating in traditional religion) than people
in other developed countries; though perhaps our religiosity interferes with
the development of other spiritual perspectives.

Dear Richard Owens=2C

I started writing poetry when I was in grammar school=2C I don't remember w=
hat age exactly.

I had read Lewis Carroll's Hunting of the Snark=2C which had scared the hol=
y living crap out of me.

I was so terrified=2C I didn't know what to do with myself. So I sat down a=
nd wrote a poem=2C trying to write something even more terrifying than Hunt=
ing of the Snark.

I am not sure what my motivations were. I'm sure a good child psychologist =
would have a theory or two.

This has been=2C more or less=2C my relationship to writing for the last 40=
 years or so.

I'm not entirely unsympathetic to what you're saying. A piece I wrote in th=
e 90s and published in How To Proceed in the Arts=2C "First Draft Imaginary=
 Writer Survey=2C" ends with the questions:

"Why do we call it 'submission'? What are we collectively 'accepting'? What=
 do we write about when we write about writing?"

That said=2C I didn't post a bad poem to poetry.com to prove that such cont=
ests are bad=2C as it appears Catherine=2C who beat me to the punch=2C did.

Nor to prove that people who know nothing about poetry can't judge it=2C as=
 it appears Jennifer might believe. (I couldn't agree less with that sentim=
ent.)

I certainly did not do it to show up anyone's "usurious" practices. I do no=
t like that word nor how it has been used to target a certain population.

I did it because I was pissed off about what had happened to my grandfather=
. Less so his having been duped by poetry.com--I had mixed feelings about t=
hat=2C as it had actually given him some mild pleasure while he was on his =
deathbed. He was in great pain and dying=2C after all. As consolation=2C po=
etry.com made him feel as though he was a "real" poet. (Whatever that is.) =
He recited his winning poem to me over the phone from memory while he was i=
n the hospital.=20

I was really pissed off because he had died=2C coughing up blood in a hospi=
tal with my grandmother at his side.

I don't care whether or not poetry magazines or presses or universities or =
individuals hold contests and charge entry fees. I have never entered one=
=2C not one with a fee. But not because I am morally opposed to them. The s=
imple truth is that I am a cheapskate. If I felt more than 75% sure that my=
 manuscript stood a chance=2C I might pay the money and send it.

I like Noah Eli Gordon. I met him once in Denver. He was sweet and funny an=
d talked a lot about poetry. Which he clearly loves. More than I do=2C cert=
ainly. I have no interest in poetry beyond that which directly feeds=2C ins=
pires=2C terrifies=2C surprises me. That which engages me. That's probably =
true for him=2C too=2C though I would imagine that he's engaged in far more=
 being written today than I am.=20

I have no opinion one way or the other about any contest that he might be p=
romoting or managing or dreaming up or whathaveyou. That's his business.=20

I do know that=2C when you are spotted doing anything beyond appearing to b=
e a humble poet dutifully hunched over a desk in the corner crafting your s=
ome-day important earth-shattering poems=2C that some poets sometimes like =
to trash talk you=2C call you a capitalist=2C usurer=2C careerist=2C fraud=
=2C whatever. Poetry is a religion for the people who do this. They are wel=
come to it. I am a third or fourth generation atheist=2C and I have no inte=
rest in magical or ritualized thinking about anything=2C least of all poetr=
y.=20

I admire many of the people who have chimed in against poetry contests. But=
 no more or less so than I admire Noah. Or anyone=2C for that matter=2C who=
 might submit their work to the contest he announced.

After all=2C my grandfather=2C who I loved very dearly=2C was a contest-sub=
mitter. Indeed: a contest winner! And his poem actually made me cry when he=
 recited it to me=2C which is more than I can say for almost everything cur=
rently in print=2C however it might have wound up there.

This is not all to say that you are wrong to feel how you do about contests=
. That's your business and you are of course as qualified as anyone else to=
 think about such things. Just that=2C though I appreciate the call-out=2C =
I thought I should be open about the situation of having written that poetr=
y.com poem and what my own honest feelings about contests are. To me=2C the=
y are=2C like those words "submission" and "acceptance=2C" part of the land=
scape=2C and do define us to some extent. Just like everything else.

Gary

Dear Adam:

Thank you for your kind and thoughtful responses to all the posts--
in the last year i read a great deal of Mallarme's work--
and opening a book of his last night it struck me very much if you haven't
already read his "poemes critiques"--poetic essays--there are several which
might interest you--
 just a few years ago an excellent english language edition of the poet's
DIVIGATIONS appeared from Harvard Press's Belknap Prss, translated by
Barbara Johnson--and it has among its quite wide range of peieces chosen by
thepoet himself the famous essays "Crisis in Verse," "The Book as Spiritual
Instrument," "Restricted Action,"  as well as Mallarme's piece on Wagner,
among the music essays included.

Mallarme thought of and wrote poetry and prose as the spiritual experience
itself, following a long "dark night of the soul, " periodically undergone
again to a greater or lesser degree, which  series of spiritual crises
brought him to poetry itself as being the site of the spiritual, as well as
poetry alone having any use or meaning, a quite radical development

The interest in Wagner led to Mallarme's expansion of the idea of the poem
itself to include al the elements and more of Wagner's "Total Work of Art."
Out of this conception of poetry as including music and dance, gesture and
setting--Mallarme created what is often considered the first "Modern" work
of Visual Poetry, "Un Coup de des n'abolira jamais le hasard"--(A Throw of
the Dice will Never Abolish Chance') --the layout, spacing and uses of vast
"silences," "blank areas"--functioning as the Visual Score for the
sound/silence interplay in the composition, heard and felt as a poetry-musi=
c
spiritual experience.

Here is a quote which may be of interest/use in taking a
look/listening/performing of Poetry, Mallarme's and others':

"Poetry is the expression, by means of human language brought back to its
essential rhythm, of the mysterious sense of existence: thus it endows our
stay on earth with authenticity and constitutes the spiritual task."

An excellent source for the biographical frame/background of the developmen=
t
of Mallarm=E9's ideas is Gordon Millar's  A THROW OF THE DICE  The Life of
Stephane Mallarme (New York: Farrar, Strauss & Giroux, 1994).

(I shd note also that as far as politics is concerned, Mallarme numbered as
friends many of the then famous, fashionable Anarchists of the 1890's,
including among them especially his close friend and attendee of Mallarm=E9=
's
famous Salon--Felix Feneon--at whose trial for being among the
(non-existent) "Conpiracy of Thirty," Mallarme testified as character
witness for the embattled Anarchist, Editor, Translator--

TYRONE:

i fully recognize how easy it is to critique current practices _without_ of=
fering any sort of alternate model -- which is what i think you're point ou=
t. i also think there are multiple forms of complicity and there are no han=
ds grounded in cultural production that ain't been sullied or compromised -=
- which, if i'm not misreading yr comment, also seems to be what yr saying.=
 aiming to respond here, so plz bear w/ the hasty, disjunctive notes.

this thread has split (or can be split) into a number of directions, two in=
 particular: 1. politically responsible publishing models; 2. pedagogical a=
pproaches to teaching writing and the relation of the MFA industry to publi=
shing.=20

i'm not sure i can offer approaches to publishing that might be satisfying =
to others, in large part because this is contingent on how others understan=
d poetries, what they expect from the production of poems, etc. if the purs=
uit is formal recognition or landing a book deal with a known, "respectable=
," career-friendly publisher, then i'm not sure anything i might have to su=
ggest here works toward these goals. but if the aim is to enter into a conv=
ersation or to support (or generate) a community of people with articulated=
 interests, then maybe some of the approaches i've taken in the past might =
be of use -- but anything i've done myself has been modeled for me by other=
s -- and so i think the question of pedagogy, of modeling, is incredibly im=
portant here.

damn the caesars has always been a journal of contemporary poetry and poeti=
cs, but it emerges, like any number of other poetry mags, out of 90s zine c=
ulture -- Tim Yohanan's Maximum Rock-n-Roll, Chris Boarts' Slug and Lettuce=
 (ABC-No-Rio), the Minneapolis mag Profane Existence (at once mag, record l=
abel, community). these semi-autonomous communities were, thru the late 80s=
 & early 90s, articulated with one another, in conversation with one anothe=
r. most were by and large anarcho-squatter operations -- newsprint pubs dis=
tributed for free or sold only to cover the cost of production. i adopted t=
his model in 2005 for the first 2 #s of DTC -- both of which i brought out =
in NJ. covers were printed offset and guts run thru a laser jet printer in =
my wife's living room. those first 2 #s included work by people i had been =
in correspondence with for several years (Dale Smith, Roger Snell, Kent Joh=
nson) and people i admired and tracked down (Amiri Baraka, Attila
 the Stockbroker, Clayton Eshleman). but both #s (in runs of 150) were paid=
 for completely out of pocket, on the $10 an hour i earned working as an ad=
vocate for migrant farm workers (i recall here James Purdy's insistence tha=
t he consistently spent far more on postage than he ever did on food).=20

in the spring of 2005 i moved to Buffalo to do graduate work in the Poetics=
 Program (a critical rather than creative program -- and the only program i=
 applied to). after soliciting the program for funding, Susan Howe, Steve M=
cCaffery and Dennis Tedlock each generously supported the journal -- which =
then allowed me to distribute it for far _less_ than the cost of production=
. postage continued to come completely out of pocket (and, as an MA student=
 then, i drew these moneys from student loans i find myself still paying of=
f). the last volume of DTC, which i just announced earlier this month, will=
 be the last funded by the Poetics Program and now i find myself struggling=
 again for a way to sustain the journal.=C2=A0=20

but something worth pointing out here is that, while funding from the depar=
tment _can_ be viewed as a compromised source that inadvertently extends or=
 sustains the university _industry_, it's also crucial to recognize a few t=
hings: 1) as editor/curator, i wasn't seeking to publish my own work (viz. =
the journal wasn't a solipsistic venture wherein i place my own private int=
erests or my own writing before others); 2) the Poetics Program has, since =
its inception, generously supported an impressively catholic range of publi=
shing ventures proposed within the program; 3) university funding comes fro=
m a range of sources (however questionable), but filtered as these moneys a=
re through an incredibly complex bureaucratic system, editors and artists t=
hat apply for these funds (or, i think, arts funding in general) are not ex=
actly performing in the same way as those publishers that introduce contest=
 schemes at the ground level. naturally i recognize there's far more
 that needs considering here, but this last difference between institutiona=
l funding and ground-level contest schemes cannot, i think, be overstated.=
=20

in terms of less-compromised publishing models, there are a few that come t=
o mind. the most immediate simply involves purchasing a laser jet printer; =
the web is an invaluable resource -- purchase a domain and construct an onl=
ine journal (Shampoo, May Day, Jacket, a few others come to mind). altho _m=
any_ wld disagree with me, i take blogs (Word Press, Blogspot, etc) as a st=
unningly viable source of publication (both Thom Donovan and Sean Bonney, t=
wo poets i deeply admire, publish _most_ of their work first on their blogs=
, without shame and without apology & both are poets that many of us take v=
ery seriously).=20

Boog City editor David A Kirschenbaum once told me a print run of 1500 news=
print copies costs him less than $400 -- and most of this is, i believe, pa=
id for thru advertising (perhaps a compromised practice, but these ads are =
largely for small presses and magazines). this is a model i'm seriously con=
sidering for future #s of DTC.=20

Print on demand (POD) offers a range of wonderful possibilities. BlazeVOX e=
ditor Geoff Gatza, who, comes out of a string of virtually uncharted state =
colleges and from a modest working class background, has in 10 years time s=
ituated himself as a poor folk's James Laughlin -- and his view of publishi=
ng is particularly exciting in its rigidly democratic, iconoclastic and lat=
eralizing approach: Geoff believes EVERYONE shld have a bk, no exceptions -=
- and this view, in its sheer beauty and within the frame of the MFA or AWP=
 industry, utterly devalues the single-author book as species of cultural c=
urrency that can be thrown up on the market in service of careers, etc. Geo=
ff's view, that is, angles toward the total collapse of privilege, genius, =
etc.=20

other publishers that have gone the POD route: Shearsman, Salt, a range of =
university presses bring out POD publications, the magazine ON: Contemporar=
y Practice (edited by Michael Cross, Thom Donovan, Kyle Schlesinger) is run=
 thru Lulu.=20

so: Newsprint (with or without ads costs are still modest); POD (which does=
n't require a publisher to hold, say, 400 copies of a title and minimizes w=
aste -- no remaindered copies); the web (overhead for an online journal is =
low) --- a few others i'd like to note, but ...=20

on the terrain of pedagogy, these models are, again, iconoclastic -- they o=
ffer possibilities for lateralizing, for challenging the authority certain =
journals, presses and publishers have, for whatever reasons, been invested =
with. rather than "submit" (kow-tow) or tailor your work to match the sensi=
bilities of magazines and publishers with cultural power (i.e. New Directio=
ns, City Lights, Coffee House, any number of university presses, any number=
 of established small presses, etc), students can be encouraged to carve ou=
t site and community specific spaces that meet their needs -- and they can =
be encouraged to articulate their communities with others through conversat=
ion and correspondence. there's a lot more to say here and i'd be grateful =
to hear from others with publishing (and outreach) models we haven't yet co=
nsidered.=20

the last publishing model i'm working with in an effort to simply cover the=
 cost of production is advanced subscription -- the approach Five Seasons P=
ress used when bringing out Alan Halsey's Lives of the Poets, and one used =
by Bill Griffiths' Pirate Press when he brought out a mimeo edition of Beow=
ulf in the mid 1970s. Jed Birmingham uploaded some images from the mimeo ed=
 to his blog:

http://mimeomimeo.blogspot.com/2009/11/pirated-beowulf.html

(click on the image of the subscription page) here _advanced_ subscribers w=
ho provide a press with the funding needed to bring out a publication are a=
cknowledged _by name_ in that pub -- a practice which is, among other thing=
s, very useful to scholars for considering community formation or tracking =
down multiple copies of a particular publication. rather than asking young =
poets for reading fees and rather than throwing them into competition with =
one another (NB: here i'm not so sure poets entering contests regard the re=
ading fee they pay as support for a press; i think most probably -- and sad=
ly -- regard it as a monetary contribution that guarantees their work will =
be read with some measure of care), advanced subscription acknowledges _eve=
ryone_ that subscribed and it doesn't do so not by pitting people against o=
ne another or fostering a competitive situation. if a potential subscriber =
has no interest in a work, then they don't subscribe. it's that
 simple. with this model a sliding scale can be introduced to accommodate t=
hose with little means that nonetheless seek to participate. my first stab =
at the model:=20

http://damnthecaesars.org/kentjohnson.html

anyhow -- with those first few issues of DTC (which i am, as ever, not sure=
 can be recognized as "successful"), i mailed dozens, if not hundreds, of c=
opies out to poets i admired -- poets whose mailing addresses i painstaking=
ly track down (tho many were generously provided to me by a friend, but he =
was a friend i'd already been in correspondence with for over _5_ years). &=
 there's a difference to be noted here between poets one admires and those =
that might be appealed to for name recognition (like, my mag published Ashb=
ery or something). when poets i took interest in had kind things to say abo=
ut the journal or useful insights, i didn't pimp out their comments -- i di=
dn't reduce their generosity to the figure of a blurb.=20

but the view of publishing offered here is a _very_ particular view and it'=
s one immediately articulated with a _very_ particular view of what poetry =
and, more broadly, cultural production is and can be. i recognize this. but=
 the core question here is the question of "success" -- what it is, what it=
 means and, if we can establish this (and this is something i persistently =
fail to do, no matter how much consideration i lend the question), then per=
haps addressing how to move _toward_ achieving it an equitable, efficacious=
 and non-destructive way is the question that shld follow. in any case, the=
se are questions i take as central to any consideration of writing, within =
or without the classroom. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =

&, Tyrone -- & Chris &c -- i don't take this as an "answer" to any of the q=
uestions you posed so much as an invitation to consider these issues furthe=
r. i mean, tho others might disagree, i got a clear & unswerving sense of h=
ow i feel abt prize culture, poetry contests and reading fees -- but in ter=
ms of efficacious publishing models, pedagogical approaches to writing in (=
or outside) the classroom, etc -- i really wld like to hear more.=20

Rich, Chris,

Like others I have found this conversation rather interesting but like a fe=
w here, Chris especially, I'd like YOU to offer what you might see as a pol=
itically responsible publishing model. To be blunt--what is the source of f=
unding for damn the caesars? I know lots of people who use their own funds =
and state grants to support their presses but those models--siphoning capit=
al--presuppose participation in a labor market and government subsidy model=
 that has its own, shall we say, political problems...I concur completely w=
ith the winners/losers model re contests though I can't imagine many partic=
ipants think of it that way (I won! I lost!). Don't they, as I do, see it s=
imply as a way to support small presses and, as one commentator suggested, =
don't come way with a "loser" noose hung around their necks (or minds)? And=
, here's my real point, if they Do participate in the psychological game of=
 winners and losers, not participating in contests will in no way
 affect that mindset. I understand your critique of the business model that=
 facilitates such thinking but you seem to be critiquing the end result of =
such thinking--what about such thinking per se?

Dear Rich, (& Tyrone, Noah et al)--I think the reason I chimed in here was
that I don't see the absence of contests or reading fees as inherently more
responsible than otherwise. I think Noah spoke to this (& much else) pretty
candidly above, as did Tyrone, as have others.

Specifically, I think it'd be worth addressing how presses that build their
lists primarily through solicitation & publish out of pocket (or through
grant money or some other institutional funding source) *can easily
replicate* the basic economy of the version of the contest model that
deserves critique, where resumes and connections are eventually a bottom
line. Can replicate that economy even when they want to push against it.
Publishing might generally move towards establishing a standard of
legitimacy, even if only as a result of the thinking Tyrone's pointing out
that precedes the contest model or has a life outside of that model.

For my own part (and I imagine for many other folks in this conversation),
the publishing I value takes upon itself the effort to resist that
movement--to open up alternatives, to add possibilities for prosody rather
than foreclosing on them, to *politicize* publication in that way--but we
might admit that it never fully escapes a relation to that economy.
Especially if it has a strong aesthetic affiliation, even just a clear idea
of where things need to be opened up. That is, a press encourages this
"writing toward" by virtue of its own activity, it seems to me--contest or
no. I know there's a difference between a well received intervention in a
discourse & a well received entry in a contest, but it just seems like
stopping short of really examining this thing to say that it's all the faul=
t
of how the funds are gathered or that the former doesn't involve endorsing =
a
measure for success.

I think Tyrone's totally right to point out that funding sources can be an
ugly game even in the public/institutional sphere. For that matter, even in
the pass-the-plate sphere, even in the publishing collective sphere. My
sense, Rich, is that your call is (in part) for a rigidly activist
publishing--which I admire greatly. I guess I just don't see how or why tha=
t
activism should adopt a "no compromise" stance in relation to other presses=
'
efforts, especially if it's meant as a gesture towards collectivist work.
"No compromise" in the interest of what, exactly? I mean, if the question
here is how to do ethical publishing (and in the end I'm not entirely
certain that's the question you seem to be posing--or at least there's a
demand for "legit" publishing or some as-yet-unnamed x-factor that's
seriously competing w/the ethical demand), then "no compromise" is a pretty
dangerous misstep.

Hugs (more hugs after all!--it always cracks me up that you close this way =
&
I wanted to return the sentiment, sincerely),
Chris

Dear Richard Owens,

I started writing poetry when I was in grammar school, I don't remember wha=
t age exactly.

I had read Lewis Carroll's Hunting of the Snark, which had scared the holy =
living crap out of me.

I was so terrified, I didn't know what to do with myself. So I sat down and=
 wrote a poem, trying to write something even more terrifying than Hunting =
of the Snark.

I am not sure what my motivations were. I'm sure a good child psychologist =
would have a theory or two.

This has been, more or less, my relationship to writing for the last 40 yea=
rs or so.

I'm not entirely unsympathetic to what you're saying. A piece I wrote in th=
e 90s and published in How To Proceed in the Arts, "First Draft Imaginary W=
riter Survey," ends with the questions:

"Why do we call it 'submission'? What are we collectively 'accepting'? What=
 do we write about when we write about writing?"

That said, I didn't post a bad poem to poetry.com to prove that such contes=
ts are bad, as it appears Catherine, who beat me to the punch, did.

Nor to prove that people who know nothing about poetry can't judge it, as i=
t appears Jennifer might believe. (I couldn't agree less with that sentimen=
t.)

I certainly did not do it to show up anyone's "usurious" practices. I do no=
t like that word nor how it has been used to target a certain population.

I did it because I was pissed off about what had happened to my grandfather=
. Less so his having been duped by poetry.com--I had mixed feelings about t=
hat, as it had actually given him some mild pleasure while he was on his de=
athbed. He was in great pain and dying, after all. As consolation, poetry.c=
om made him feel as though he was a "real" poet. (Whatever that is.) He rec=
ited his winning poem to me over the phone from memory while he was in the =
hospital.=20

I was really pissed off because he had died, coughing up blood in a hospita=
l with my grandmother at his side.

I don't care whether or not poetry magazines or presses or universities or =
individuals hold contests and charge entry fees. I have never entered one, =
not one with a fee. But not because I am morally opposed to them. The simpl=
e truth is that I am a cheapskate. If I felt more than 75% sure that my man=
uscript stood a chance, I might pay the money and send it.

I like Noah Eli Gordon. I met him once in Denver. He was sweet and funny an=
d talked a lot about poetry. Which he clearly loves. More than I do, certai=
nly. I have no interest in poetry beyond that which directly feeds, inspire=
s, terrifies, surprises me. That which engages me. That's probably true for=
 him, too, though I would imagine that he's engaged in far more being writt=
en today than I am.=20

I have no opinion one way or the other about any contest that he might be p=
romoting or managing or dreaming up or whathaveyou. That's his business.=20

I do know that, when you are spotted doing anything beyond appearing to be =
a humble poet dutifully hunched over a desk in the corner crafting your som=
e-day important earth-shattering poems, that some poets sometimes like to t=
rash talk you, call you a capitalist, usurer, careerist, fraud, whatever. P=
oetry is a religion for the people who do this. They are welcome to it. I a=
m a third or fourth generation atheist, and I have no interest in magical o=
r ritualized thinking about anything, least of all poetry.=20

I admire many of the people who have chimed in against poetry contests. But=
 no more or less so than I admire Noah. Or anyone, for that matter, who mig=
ht submit their work to the contest he announced.

After all, my grandfather, who I loved very dearly, was a contest-submitter=
. Indeed: a contest winner! And his poem actually made me cry when he recit=
ed it to me, which is more than I can say for almost everything currently i=
n print, however it might have wound up there.

This is not all to say that you are wrong to feel how you do about contests=
. That's your business and you are of course as qualified as anyone else to=
 think about such things. Just that, though I appreciate the call-out, I th=
ought I should be open about the situation of having written that poetry.co=
m poem and what my own honest feelings about contests are. To me, they are,=
 like those words "submission" and "acceptance," part of the landscape, and=
 do define us to some extent. Just like everything else.

Gary

I've often said that the USofA is more religious and less spiritual than any
other country.  In the part of the country I live (i.e., Bible Beltish)
there seems to be a church on every corner. Truly, it's not that bad, but
it's a lot less far off the mark than you might imagine. The town I'm from
now has a population of around 900 souls.  There are AT LEAST 10 churches.
In the city where I now live there are literally hundreds of churches for a
population barely above 50,000. I've noticed that in small cities where
there are a lot of churches, the religious life tends to be cliquish.
Additionally, other aspects of life are equally fragmented and closed to
outsiders, often aligned along the lines of where people go to church.
Since I belong to no church and profess Taoism, or on occasion, Zen
Buddhism, I don't fall into any of the "Christian" or "Jewish" or "Muslum"
cliques.  I most closely resemble the Unitarian or Unity groups, but even
still since I don't "belong" I'm always not quite on the inside.  I'm
outside looking in through stained glass windows.

Someone should do a study.  I don't have the discipline.

Hi Adam,
This essay really got me thinking, but as I wrote a response I
realized I had too much to say to want to spill the whole thing onto
the list, so I wrote it up as a blog post here:
http://www.wetasphalt.com/content/mind-body-spirit-whatever-new-poetics-metaphysical

I'd very much like to here what you (or anybody else for that matter)
think.

Jason,

Thank you for your very interesting blog entry. I have a few questions
relating to it.

a) You mention "Wittgenstein's thoroughgoing linguistic mysticism that
remained present in all of his works from the Tractatus Logic-Philosophicus
onward." Could you elaborate on this more? While I agree with you that the
inner logic of Wittgenstein's own thought led him to a wall against which
beat (fly in a box), I am not sure how he transcended it. In fact, he
himself would have objected to any idea of transcendence? His followers
definitely rejected any hint or use of the concept of mysticism while
applying his thought on language games to poetics. Isn't "mysticism" a dirty
word among poets or poetry thinkers who refer to Wittgenstein most?

b) I am glad you point to the importance of Emerson and transcendentalism in
American poetry (and 19th century prose; but in your list of poets
sustaining the "spiritual" tradition you ignore a crucial figure, Jack
Spicer.

c) One generally assumes the "irrelevance" of Romanticism, at least English
Romanticism (German Romanticism is very different) to our present pursuit.
What about the most recent, extremely interesting Millennium Anthology which
attempts to re-cast Romanticism in a new light, as a precursor to modernism.
Do you buy that? I think the 19th century German Romanticism (a figure like
Novalis as much as Blake) has a lot to say to us in a pursuit of the
metaphysical /spiritual in poetry.

d) "It's there in Robert Grenier's famous written proclamation "I hate
speech" as well as in the opposite and too often unanalyzed
Deconstructionist skepticism towards writing. As such both in the Language
poets and the late post-structuralism, there is already present a fair
amount of suspicion of the materiality of language..."

This would be true if you really consider Robert Grenier a language poet; to
me, the very opposite is true. Grenier's statement is much nearer to the
Turkish poet Orhan Veli's statement: "We wish it were possible to dump even
language itself." (*Eda Anthology*). As you say, believing in the
immateriality of language, he uses visual and constructive/serial means to
show it. I do not think most language school poets would admit to any
"suspicion of the materiality of language..." though you are trying to get
them to your side.

e) "To my way of thinking, poetry at its best serves as a sort of javelin to
be launched at the veil of language beyond which lies the mystical which can
only be indicated or pointed to but not directly talked about. Poetry should
always be pushing at the limits of language..."

Wait until *The Spiritual Life of Replicants* comes out by Talisman Books
this fall. *SL* is part VI of a longer poem *The Structure of Escape:* .A
Comic Essay On Poetry.

Dear Rich,

First, the Allen Fisher piece in the new DTC is *amazing*... Is there more
out there from this project? & I like your history a few notes back--much
appreciated.

Just a rejoinder or two--the folks in this thread are not the voice of
capital, or not trying to be, many in fact trying *not* to be. I'd also say
at this point that universities have fleeced more unsuspecting citizens than
poetry contests, hands down--I really don't think there's a case there. & I
work for one. I definitely think there's more work to do on *that* front &
that contests might just be a symptom. But is it really so simple? Somehow
giving your money to lulu.com is more ethical than running a contest? Or
paying a web hosting service? (I do these, too.) I like your call to
unflinching action (or am seduced by it, when it's action) but if it's just
unflinching rhetoric we need, then fuck it. It's a sermon. (I've been
seduced by those, too. Am still, in all honesty.)

I like your thing about how capital advances by denying absolute statements.
Yep, agreed (see the contemporary university). Plenty of models, too, (old &
new, including sermons) where capital advances by way of the absolute. But I
don't think you're a capitalist--didn't & wouldn't call your absolute
statement fascist--we can leave this behavior to the pundits (who get rich
off it). I just think we could do some work to pry apart the demand for
legitimacy from these other demands, since legitimacy works too well as a
kind of coin, even in the absence of cashflow.

...Institutions as pot dealers & contests as rock slingers? Sheesh,
analogies might be something to avoid here. I honestly thought it was a bad
cut-and-paste! It's funny, but it's just wrong. We're not doing god's work
in the university & the funds aren't *just* not clean, much of the product
isn't the healthy alternative (it's debt, in part, & it's massive). Or we're
doing the bank's work as much as anyone else's. & yet many of us still feel
compelled to live/work here--to talk here (here)--would it not be better to
address this without indulging in a dressing down of each other (or dressing
up of ourselves) according to whose wire rims are the least Palin-esque,
whose window the least *Overton*?

Again, the thing that prompted me to chime in here was the thought that we
could/should be involved in measuring the *relevance* of our colleagues'
press work--that the use of contests/reading fees for funding could
*possibly* serve as a litmus test in that regard--that we should walk away
from those colleagues' press work who participate in these things as
*irrelevant*. Too much debris in that path. It's not a conservative position
to want to avoid lending a hand in piling it up.

More shortly--C

isn't that inevitable though given the fact that we are both a nation
of immigrants as well as a nation where non-conformists played a
significant role in how religion and public life intermingled. I
genuinely dislike the religious/spiritual dichotomy because it smacks
of new age theological nonsense that I have very little patience for,
but if the discussion is going to be had in those terms, I think the
opposite is true. People are very much involved in their religious
lives and religious questions in a very loose and impermanent way in
the united states. to my way of thinking, that's more about being
spiritual than it is about being religious.

but then, it's also strange that for a christian nation like we are,
most americans are completely unfamiliar with christian theology of
any kind, and as a result much of the theology that gets bandied about
is the most ignorant and stupid available. I have no problem with this
except that I think it contributes to a strange orientalism that in
fact looks a lot more like christian mysticism than it does the vedic
or chinese ideas that it is purporting to be. which is not to say that
I don't think there's a lot of value in eastern wisdom. i just don't
understand the preference for one set of faith traditions over another
when fundamentally there doesn't seem to be that much of a difference
in the epistemological criteria that are being applied.

Michael, I suggest you read 'Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of
Philosophical Concepts' by Toshihiko Izutsu, University of California Press,
Berkeley, 1984, or 'Sufi Literature and the Journey to Immortality' by A.E.
I. Falconar, Motilal Banarsidass, Patna, India, 1991.  Sufism, the mystical
stream of Islam, has much in common with Zen and Taoism and proves, likewise
that spirituality is far more important than 'religion', and goes to prove
that much contemporary poetry would be instantly melted down beyond its
constituent parts by the white hot heat at the heart of spirituality - read
Ibn Al'Arabi or Jalaluddin Rumi to begin to get a sense of that heat. There
are Christian mystics as well, of course, such as Julian of Norwich, Thomas
Traherne, Hildegard of Bingen or the Flemish mystic Jan van Ruysbroek, many
riches outside the confines of the 'established' churches. Once you start,
you won't stop, discipline or not. Enjoy the research, take care.

=93d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=94 series here in nyc =
=20
to fill our final open slot this fall for season eight (2010-2011). =20
The event will be held on Tues. Oct. 26, 2010 at 6:00 p.m.

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out.

Please backchannel any inquiries or suggestions, be they for your own =20=

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I=92m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a =20=

New York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its =20
19th year. I=92d like to invite you to take part in season eight of our =20=

=93d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=94 series.

The series is held at Chelsea=92s ACA Galleries (http://=20
acagalleries.com/), which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of =20
the poet Simon Perchik. It=92s a nice space, and we fit 100 people, =20
including a nine-piece jazz flash orchestra, in it for Chax Press=92s =20=

event, with plenty of room to spare. The gallery provides wine and =20
other beverages, and cheese and crackers and hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three =20
or more of their authors to read (we=92ve had as many as 10 for one =20
press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20
musical act perform two 15-20 minute sets. If the visiting press is =20
able to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their =20=

night, if not I can book one that I think will work well with the =20
night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC brethren.)

As of this writing, Season 8, our 2010-2011 season will feature:

Coconut Books
1913 Press
No Press
No Tell Books
Satellite Telephone
Saturnalia Books

The series is held on the last Tuesday of each month (except December) =20=

at 6:00 p.m. The following date is available:


2010

Tues. Oct. 26


We started the series in August 2003. In our first seven seasons we=92ve =
=20
hosted (or are about to host):

CHRIS:

man, in a lot ways i think our sense of the landscape is in alignment, but =
2 things: 1. the DTC narrative a couple msgs back was aimed at a question r=
asied by Tyrone, who asked how DTC is funded and whether or not i (we) cld =
provide alternate models for subsidizing print (and digital) projects; 2. i=
 do think that soliciting reading fees from poets is worse than _Paypalling=
_ cash to _Lulu_ (both of which are _wildly_ problematic), but i think this=
 for a range of reasons i'm not sure can be adequately addressed here.=20

you're right to point out the distance between unflinching action & unflinc=
hing rhetoric -- and i think this extends to another difference: the distin=
ction between tactical strategy (i.e. the call to refuse contests; and the =
gesture of publicly refusing them in real time) and analysis (i.e. the sugg=
estion that contests are themselves symptomatic of deeper tendencies that a=
re no less corrupt and more firmly entrenched and thus less visible, more p=
ermissible, etc). i agree with you (and with Tyrone) the whole way here -- =
and i don't think i've suggested anyone involved in this conversation funct=
ions as the handmaiden of capital (tho i think we all, in odd ways, are, my=
self included).=20

here i need to return to that longer msg i sent out re DTC, because there w=
as an essential point i fear was missed: the question of pedagogy. many of =
us teach _in_ university systems &, as you say, far more of us have been st=
retched across the rack by universities than taken in by poetry contests. b=
ut here there's an incredible difference: again, universities, however corr=
upt (i'm thinking here of Cary Nelson's and Marc Bousquet's amazing investi=
gations into the university industry; and of course the student loan scanda=
l that was splayed open by mainstream media a couple years back), are deepl=
y entrenched institutions that produce and reproduce forms of exploitation =
that are often difficult to name and difficult to resist -- & here the dist=
ance between praxis and analysis narrows, but at the same time the extent t=
o which we can intervene is also limited (i mean, you can fight city hall, =
but can you fight city hall?). this to say, when we talk abt funding
 sources derived from institutions, we're talking abt, as i sd before, an i=
ncredibly complex matrix of relations that reside far beyond the immediate,=
 the local, the ground. BUT (and this is the clearest point i want to make)=
, when a _small_ press (a press _at_ the ground level; a press which _is no=
t_ New Directions or City Lights or a major university press) introduces a =
contest which solicits reading fees from poets, the gesture is clearly not =
a good faith gesture but one that exploits the desire so many poets have si=
mply to be read with care -- and it's precisely this which i find so incred=
ibly saddening. and since we see these practices _at the ground level_ i do=
 believe we are responsible for calling them into question (analysis) and, =
in this case, refusing them completely (tactic).=20

it's far more difficult to challenge power at an institutional level -- and=
 to identify how power exerts itself through our own behaviors (viz. i mean=
t it when i asked folks to point out my own blindspots) -- but when we iden=
tify destructive practices at the ground level we have a responsibility to =
name them, refuse them and (again, thanks Tyrone) offer other possibilities=
. in this particular case --- the case of contest culture -- we might just =
be treating a symptom that discloses a far broader, systemic crisis, but i =
think, at the very least, the gesture is essential. as ever, that distance =
between institutional power and local community (and i take _this_ list as =
an instantiation of the "local") is crucial here.=20

&, Chris, when you say contests are symptomatic of deeper tendencies, as i =
say, i agree & it's precisely here that the question of pedagogy is indispe=
nsable b/c i think the appeal to contests with reading fees as a funding mo=
del emerges out of a very particular view of what poetry is, what a "good" =
poem is and what a successful poet is -- and it's precisely this view of po=
etry, and cultural production in general, that has to be troubled, splayed =
open and radically reimagined. as Pierre pointed out a couple days back, wh=
en a poet asks "how do we get a foot in the door?", this question rests on =
a range of very troubling assumptions about what culture is, how it comes t=
o us, how we respond to it and how we participate in its production.=A0 =A0=

Dear Rich,

First, the Allen Fisher piece in the new DTC is *amazing*... Is there more
out there from this project? & I like your history a few notes back--much
appreciated.

Just a rejoinder or two--the folks in this thread are not the voice of
capital, or not trying to be, many in fact trying *not* to be. I'd also say
at this point that universities have fleeced more unsuspecting citizens tha=
n
poetry contests, hands down--I really don't think there's a case there. & I
work for one. I definitely think there's more work to do on *that* front &
that contests might just be a symptom. But is it really so simple? Somehow
giving your money to lulu.com is more ethical than running a contest? Or
paying a web hosting service? (I do these, too.) I like your call to
unflinching action (or am seduced by it, when it's action) but if it's just
unflinching rhetoric we need, then fuck it. It's a sermon. (I've been
seduced by those, too. Am still, in all honesty.)

I like your thing about how capital advances by denying absolute statements=
.
Yep, agreed (see the contemporary university). Plenty of models, too, (old =
&
new, including sermons) where capital advances by way of the absolute. But =
I
don't think you're a capitalist--didn't & wouldn't call your absolute
statement fascist--we can leave this behavior to the pundits (who get rich
off it). I just think we could do some work to pry apart the demand for
legitimacy from these other demands, since legitimacy works too well as a
kind of coin, even in the absence of cashflow.

...Institutions as pot dealers & contests as rock slingers? Sheesh,
analogies might be something to avoid here. I honestly thought it was a bad
cut-and-paste! It's funny, but it's just wrong. We're not doing god's work
in the university & the funds aren't *just* not clean, much of the product
isn't the healthy alternative (it's debt, in part, & it's massive). Or we'r=
e
doing the bank's work as much as anyone else's. & yet many of us still feel
compelled to live/work here--to talk here (here)--would it not be better to
address this without indulging in a dressing down of each other (or dressin=
g
up of ourselves) according to whose wire rims are the least Palin-esque,
whose window the least *Overton*?

Again, the thing that prompted me to chime in here was the thought that we
could/should be involved in measuring the *relevance* of our colleagues'
press work--that the use of contests/reading fees for funding could
*possibly* serve as a litmus test in that regard--that we should walk away
from those colleagues' press work who participate in these things as
*irrelevant*. Too much debris in that path. It's not a conservative positio=
n
to want to avoid lending a hand in piling it up.

More shortly--C

Poets & Poetry Lovers,

We have just posted an interview with W.S. Merwin on www.poetrypoetry.com.
The interview took place at the Dodge Festival some years ago. His
laureate appointment prompted me to rummage through my poetic archives and
find the tape.

In the interview, Merwin talks about poetry coming from the "right place,"
comments on his teacher Richard Blackburn, tells a bit about his early
influence by Milton, and offers advice for those who would better
appreciate poetry. He is such a good interviewee I barely needed to talk
at all, asking 5-6 questions in entire the 9-minute interview.

Please pass this on to interested others and if you are so inclined,
browse the other features on poetrypoetry. We've been posting audio poetry
since 2000 (don't believe the counter on the homepage, a technical glitch
recently reset it.)

Yours in Peace & Poetry,

Charlie Rossiter

Hi Murat,
Excellent feedback, thanks!

  On the first point, it's notable I think that wittgenstein never
denied that there might be a beetle in the box, but just that there
was a meaningful way to talk about it. And yet he's clearly
sympathetic to impulses in that regard. In his lecture on ethics,
while denying that there can be "the ultimate good" as a meaningful
object of discourse, he also says that he understands the impulse to
try to talk about it nevertheless and he would never suggest that
anyone should not try to talk about it because the attempt is in
itself valuable. There are further two remarks that I think are
telling. First there's the comment that there are two books in the
Tractatus, first everything he wrote, and second everything he didn't
write (because he couldn't), and of the two the latter is far more
important. Second the section from the tractatus which I've never
found him repudiating that I think speaks to this is 6.4 (all
propositions are of equal value) and the comments to it. I'll quote
here at length:

"6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world
everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is
no value -- and if there were, it would be of no value.

If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all
happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.
What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise
this would again be accidental.

It must lie outside the world.

6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions.

Propositions cannot express anything higher.

6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the
limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be
expressed in language.

In brief, the world must thereby become quite another, it must so to
speak wax or wane as a whole.

The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy.

6.44 Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

6.45 The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its
contemplation as a limited whole.

The feeling that the world is a limited whole is the mystical feeling."

Those are the sort of remarks, which he continually made whenever he
returned to notions of value and judgement, that I mean when I refer
to Wittgenstein's mysticism. One of the things that I think a large
number of casual wittgenstein readers misunderstand is the idea that
"the limits of the language form the limits of my world" is not a
expression of a sort of nominalism, that is, it's not a statement
about the world, it's a statement about language. the huge aspect of
reality about which we are incapable of having meaningful discourse
because we can't say anything meaningful about it, that for
Wittgenstein is the most important part, and in that part of human
life lies all of the traditional notions of occultism, spirituality,
faith, and religion.

B RE: Spicer. He does, I think, form a touchstone. as does

C. I'm going to plead ignorance on this point because I haven't read
the anthology yet, but if I understand the idea then I think I might
agree. I tend to think of modernism as having more tension present in
it tho at least in its attitudes, and I also think it starts much
earlier, given my opinion that not a lot of people agree with me about
that Moby Dick is the first postmodern novel and therefore the
modernist postmodernist tension dates to the nineteenth century at
least. As for the german romantics, i'm less well versded. I have been
reading Goethe lately and it's very much resonating with me in a way
that I haven't fully integrated in my thinking yet, but I think i can
see what you're getting at there.

D. You're right that Grenier is a special case, and I'll admit i was
maybe being a little propagandistic in my cooption of Language poetry.
I have a hard time seeing them all as a unified group in any case, but
they're a little too important to me personally to allow for the
outright materialism that I felt Adam painted them with in his piece,
although I think he's largely right. The appeal to Grenier, I will
confess, could be just some sleight of hand to try to rescue a larger
movement from a specific criticism, and I think it's fair to call me
on that. That said, I don't much care if any of the big Language folks
agree that their work is suspicious of the materiality of language, i
think i see it there anyway as a sort of irony that has to
counterbalance the extreme focus on the textuality of writing. To me,
reading something like the Chinese Notebook, for example, I feel like
there's a certain amount of whistling at the dark that's going on, at
least as it strikes me.

E. I am very much looking forward to it!



Regards,
Jason

Hi, Jason,

" On the first point, it's notable I think that wittgenstein never denied
that there might be a beetle in the box, but just that there was a
meaningful way to talk about it. And yet he's clearly sympathetic to
impulses in that regard. In his lecture on ethics, while denying that there
can be "the ultimate good" as a meaningful object of discourse, he also says
that he understands the impulse to try to talk about it nevertheless and he
would never suggest that anyone should not try to talk about it because the
attempt is in itself valuable. There are further two remarks that I think
are telling. First there's the comment that there are two books in the
Tractatus, first everything he wrote, and second everything he didn't write
(because he couldn't), and of the two the latter is far more important.
Second the section from the tractatus which I've never found him repudiating
that I think speaks to this is 6.4 (all propositions are of equal value) and
the comments to it. I'll quote here at length:

"6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world
everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no
value -- and if there were, it would be of no value."

Do you not see the circularity of Wittgenstein's argument? While he pays lip
service to by being "sympathetic" to ethical impulses, he condescends to it
and relegates it to subservient category. If he can not talk "meaningfully"
about something, then he does not talk about it. Therefore, that thing
becomes invisible: "he didn't write about it because he couldn't." On a
grand scale, is this argument any different from the drunkard who looks for
the key under the light because that's where the light is, not necessarily
where the key is?

Wittgenstein never explores or goes after that "outside" world ("the sense
of the world"). His thinking concerns itself only with what "as it is and
happens as it does happen."

Here I think an analysis of syntax is important -specifically the English
syntax, composed of subject and predicate- is important. That is the syntax
for an empirical view of the world -where things either happen (are true) or
don't happen (are not true). Wittgeinstein accepts this implicitly as the
paradigm, as far as I can tell, with defending why.

Now, instead, consider a syntactical structure replete with conjunctive
forms (a syntax of possibilities, of potential thought) -as the
agglutinative Turkish syntax is, which records thought in the process of
emerging (once again, see *Eda Anthology*), not as true or false but as
process, then a philosophical view of such a world would be totally
different -pre-analytic, much more inclusive, in which a "subject-predicate"
construction is only a part.

"If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening
and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.
What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this
would again be accidental.

It must lie outside the world."

Here Wittgenstein is practicing, is following Hume's radical skepticism
about the "innate logic" of reality to which the continental philosophy
(from Spinoza to Kant, etc.) is a counterpoint.

"6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions."

Here one can see W's circular thinking in practice.

"Propositions cannot express anything higher."

Yes, this is true if the only possible or valid linguistic structure having
any hold to reality consisted of the propositions, that is to say,
subject-predicate structure. This is a priori assumption on W's part having
to do, as far as I can see, very little connection to reality, the state
state in which language function. Subject=predicate is a mere abstraction
from it.


"6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, it can only change the
limits of the world, not the facts; not the things that can be expressed in
language."

It seems to me wrong. If you change the limits of language (more
specifically of *a* language, that's why the importance of translation), you
are changing what can be said in it. As I said, here lies the crucial
importance of translation and Benjamin's thought about it -on
disintegration, fragmentation, etc.

"In brief, the world must thereby become quite another, it must so to speak
wax or wane as a whole.

The world of the happy is quite another than that of the unhappy."

W. ignores the consequences of what he is saying here.

"6.44 Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

This sentence remind me of Einstein's "God does not play dice with the
universe." Cute, what it does not enter Einstein's thoughts in physics
(unless I misunderstand him).


"6.45 The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation
as a limited whole.

The feeling that the world is a limited whole is the mystical feeling."

That's where the great divide between W. and Benjamin comes. Benjamin is all
for breaking down these "wholes" in the realm of "ideal language. He points
us to an outline of "a structure of escape."

"Those are the sort of remarks, which he continually made whenever he
returned to notions of value and judgement, that I mean when I refer to
Wittgenstein's mysticism. One of the things that I think a large number of
casual wittgenstein readers misunderstand is the idea that "the limits of
the language form the limits of my world" is not a expression of a sort of
nominalism, that is, it's not a statement about the world, it's a statement
about language. the huge aspect of reality about which we are incapable of
having meaningful discourse because we can't say anything meaningful about
it, that for Wittgenstein is the most important part, and in that part of
human life lies all of the traditional notions of occultism, spirituality,
faith, and religion."

That's where Benjamin goes beyond Wittgeinstein, essentially in my opinion
rebuts him.

"B RE: Spicer. He does, I think, form a touchstone. as does"

Yes.

"C. I'm going to plead ignorance on this point because I haven't read the
anthology yet, but if I understand the idea then I think I might agree. I
tend to think of modernism as having more tension present in it tho at least
in its attitudes, and I also think it starts much earlier, given my opinion
that not a lot of people agree with me about that Moby Dick is the first
postmodern novel and therefore the modernist postmodernist tension dates to
the nineteenth century at least. As for the german romantics, i'm less well
versded. I have been reading Goethe lately and it's very much resonating
with me in a way that I haven't fully integrated in my thinking yet, but I
think i can see what you're getting at there."

I think you will find the Eda anthology very interesting. A hundred twenty
page selection from it (with a few additional essays) has appeared in a
special section in *Jacket* (http://jacketmagazine.com/34/eda-essays.sh)

I agree with you completely about *Moby Dick*.

"D. You're right that Grenier is a special case, and I'll admit i was maybe
being a little propagandistic in my cooption of Language poetry. I have a
hard time seeing them all as a unified group in any case, but they're a
little too important to me personally to allow for the outright materialism
that I felt Adam painted them with in his piece, although I think he's
largely right. The appeal to Grenier, I will confess, could be just some
sleight of hand to try to rescue a larger movement from a specific
criticism, and I think it's fair to call me on that. That said, I don't much
care if any of the big Language folks agree that their work is suspicious of
the materiality of language, i think i see it there anyway as a sort of
irony that has to counterbalance the extreme focus on the textuality of
writing. To me, reading something like the Chinese Notebook, for example, I
feel like there's a certain amount of whistling at the dark that's going on,
at least as it strikes me."

I sympathize with your divided loyalty about Language School poets, but I
think one should call a spade a spade.

E. I am very much looking forward to it!

I'll announce it the moment it is out.

Thank you again for your very thoughtful remarks.

Ciao,

Murat

Catherine, CJ, RICH, et al.:

I agree -- some of the discussion has veered dangerously close to the
sentiment Pound identified 100 yrs ago, sealing poetry off in its own
pleasure dome beyond any whiff of money, which becomes nothing more than an
excuse not to pay anyone anything in the realm of the arts. The question
isn't whether capital itself is a compromise -- it definitely is. BUT paper,
ink, postage, binding, all these things cost money, and they have to be paid
for somehow. To get back to Rich's original point, we can't control THAT,
but we can decide how and where the money comes from. We can and should
offer alternatives to the current system, which the contest set-up, Rich
asserts and I agree, merely replicates on a small scale. I've written more
and exhaustively about this on my blog

http://habenichtpress.com/

and i'd gladly invite folks to read and comment...

David

Ron, I've read a little of Sufi literature. Rumi is a favorite. I have
"Tales of the Reed Pipe" too, and love it. I've read some of the Christian
Mystics but can't say I really care for many of them beyond St. John of the
Cross.  I do occasionally read something new in those areas, but I feel more
of an affinity to the Taoists and Zen Buddhists. Funny you should mention
Motilal Barnasidass.  I've ordered several books from them.  One,in
particular on Jnana Yoga that I've read several times. I also have their
Buddhist Sanskrit Grammar & Dictionary, which proved invaluable in my study
of Stcherbatsky.

Thanks for the note.

Sad news, Beyond Baroque is currently throwing its first contest.

http://www.beyondbaroque.org/news.html

<http://www.beyondbaroque.org/news.html>So here we have an independent
cultural institution of long standing that has $1 rent, a mostly volunteer
staff, and trustees/board members who are not donors,  not effectively
fundraising and grant writing except from government -- although it is
possible that they are refusing to apply for funds from Readers Digest or
the Irvine Foundation, etc. etc. -- that also refuses to make money from
workshops (they are famous for offering free showers and workshops both! --
but they could charge for some classes like the Poetry Project does), the
bookstore (by doing things like not asking local presses for donations of
remaindered books or local poets for donations of used books; by not selling
books online; by not looking up the value of some of the rare first editions
that linger on the shelves), the archive, the art gallery, the
readings/performances themselves, relationships with other arts
institutions, or the press (by not listing all of the books in print on
Amazon; by having broken paypal links on the site -- they are at SPD).

Nope, they're having a contest.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Wittgenstein believed that most (but by no means all) talk about the
mystical or the transcendental or the spiritual amounted to a load of
crap/delusion/self-delusion. And who can disagree? Step into a bookstore and
peruse the relevant sections. This is why he particularly loved Samuel
Johnson's prayers (a small volume of which he often carried with him)
-because they eschew claptrap, that is, are ethical writings rather than
mystical in nature.

It's an egregious mistake to caricature Wittgenstein as some sort of
cold-hearted atheist materialist logician. Read anything about his life -the
many memoirs left by his students (I like Norman Malcolm's best, a very
moving small book), the biography by Ray Monk- and you find a man absolutely
tortured by ethical considerations.

Dear Rich--At this distance, here's what I know of your public presence in
the past week: a massive launch from DTC/Punch Press (a piece of mail for
which I'm *incredibly* grateful--holy shit the Marianne Morris poem!) & your
intervention here. The first of these (the launch) is a tactic that *very*
successfully addresses the concerns you want to address & offers one of the
alternative models that Tyrone asked you to speak to. The second, as tactic,
is thus far just a random belligerence, as far as I can tell, even though I
understand that you & some others here don't think so. At least in its basic
spirit anyhow.

I actually need to duck out of this thread for awhile & get some work done
before the semester starts back up. Desperately trying to get back to
writing a longer thing on Myung Mi Kim & Rachel Blau Duplessis--two poets
(among many) whose work would be virtually stranded by the action you call
for, unless I've somehow misunderstood your call. If I have misunderstood
it, then *please* clarify--are you asking us to walk away from any press who
runs a contest or charges a reading fee (taking w/us our money, our work,
our reviews, our venues, etc)? I mean, in addition to listserv drive-by's,
what's to be done that isn't already being done? (I'm really asking, here.
If I'm missing what the *action* is, I'd like someone to clarify.)

I also want to ask you (& David--hi David) to seriously revisit the question
of whether this type of absolutism can really be practiced from within the
funded halls of a PhD program, *while collecting a paycheck for teaching
undergraduate students who are largely going into hock to pay for their
ticket for that ride*. (I know it isn't making you rich, but come on.) I
fully understand your "top-down" theory about contests (that institutional
funding--in the form of a grant for a press (or even a fellowship,
right?)--is less questionable than the contest model because it supposedly
doesn't prey on vulnerable writers), but honestly: it's UB's listserv & UB's
dime you're posting on. I'm being blunt (and maybe even a bit reductive)
here NOT because I think you should be ashamed of yourselves for accepting
that funding & using it in your small press activities--I think the
oppositein fact--but your call to action (or the way you've chosen to
articulate it?
here & in David's blog post) starts to seem not a little evangelical & even
insincere. Professionalization in the arts is *exactly* what you're wanting
to confront, right (using a refusal of contest-model funding particularly
for *small* presses as the staging ground)? Shit guys: analyze, then. &
proceed w/caution before moving into your tactical phase.

As someone you & David have both published & as someone who's published both
of you, I need you (both) to know I'm saying this out of affection, respect
& concern. (I hope it's not necessary to say it, but in case it is--I
wouldn't have joined in here if that weren't true.) There are a number of
other things to resist or struggle to complicate, in addition to capital,
that mingle with our thing: a model for community building that's based in
haphazard antagonism (largely towards, I begin to fear, affiliation) comes
to mind, for a start. That's not to say you don't have my support in doing
the work of problematizing capital, but maybe we can multi-task?

Yours,
CJ Martin

 I recently published a book with Blue Lion Press, which uses Lulu as its p=
rinter. The press is edited by Jukka-Pekka Kervinen and Peter Ganick. It is=
 entitled "Jazz Forms" and is essentially my selected poems from 1988-2008.=
 You can purchase a copy at Lulu for $9 or simply download the entire book =
for free. The link is

"Poets have long been mesmerized by jazz. And when they get together in the=
 same room they tend to resemble each other. But Jefferson Hansen has done =
something different in Jazz Forms. The impulse might still be mimetic but h=
e translates what he is listening to into a work that is full of ecosystems=
 and associations, full of things like birds and fires and air and bears an=
d babies. The jazz in "Jazz Forms" leads to trance, is transformative."

CHRIS:

at this juncture, yeah, we're sadly at a dead end. but i do find myself wei=
rdly shocked that you see opposition to poetry contests that call for readi=
ng fees as a species of belligerence. viz. there's really no _meaningful_ c=
omparison between, on one hand, a _small_ press that solicits poets for "re=
ading fees" and, on the other hand, a poet getting paid to teach within an =
always already institutionally compromised environment (& here i _fully_ re=
cognize what you're saying).=20

& when you say, Chris, you ain't so immaculate yrself so don't call out any=
one else for being dirty (i.e. "while collecting a payecheck ... "), that l=
ogic just don't fly. i mean, the aim for a few folks here has at times been=
 geared toward defending contests as ethical practice by way of a logic tha=
t suggests any source of funding is bad so, in turn, all sources of funding=
 are good. & this just simply is not the case. & it's precisely here that t=
he "bad cut and paste" you pointed out in one of my previous msgs is perfec=
tly applicable, precisely in spite of the logic that denied it.=A0=20

in the end my intervention here is an expression of concern, not belligeren=
ce. it's worth marking the difference. if yr comments below, a few of which=
 i take as clearly belligerent, are intended to suggest i intervened in thi=
s issue at this moment to draw attention to DTC -- well, that's not it by a=
 long shot. DTC & the pubs always sell reasonably well, w/ or w/out the cir=

Dear Rich--At this distance, here's what I know of your public presence in
the past week: a massive launch from DTC/Punch Press (a piece of mail for
which I'm *incredibly* grateful--holy shit the Marianne Morris poem!) & you=
r
intervention here. The first of these (the launch) is a tactic that *very*
successfully addresses the concerns you want to address & offers one of the
alternative models that Tyrone asked you to speak to. The second, as tactic=
,
is thus far just a random belligerence, as far as I can tell, even though I
understand that you & some others here don't think so. At least in its basi=
c
spirit anyhow.

I actually need to duck out of this thread for awhile & get some work done
before the semester starts back up. Desperately trying to get back to
writing a longer thing on Myung Mi Kim & Rachel Blau Duplessis--two poets
(among many) whose work would be virtually stranded by the action you call
for, unless I've somehow misunderstood your call. If I have misunderstood
it, then *please* clarify--are you asking us to walk away from any press wh=
o
runs a contest or charges a reading fee (taking w/us our money, our work,
our reviews, our venues, etc)? I mean, in addition to listserv drive-by's,
what's to be done that isn't already being done? (I'm really asking, here.
If I'm missing what the *action* is, I'd like someone to clarify.)

I also want to ask you (& David--hi David) to seriously revisit the questio=
n
of whether this type of absolutism can really be practiced from within the
funded halls of a PhD program, *while collecting a paycheck for teaching
undergraduate students who are largely going into hock to pay for their
ticket for that ride*. (I know it isn't making you rich, but come on.) I
fully understand your "top-down" theory about contests (that institutional
funding--in the form of a grant for a press (or even a fellowship,
right?)--is less questionable than the contest model because it supposedly
doesn't prey on vulnerable writers), but honestly: it's UB's listserv & UB'=
s
dime you're posting on. I'm being blunt (and maybe even a bit reductive)
here NOT because I think you should be ashamed of yourselves for accepting
that funding & using it in your small press activities--I think the
oppositein fact--but your call to action (or the way you've chosen to
articulate it?
here & in David's blog post) starts to seem not a little evangelical & even
insincere. Professionalization in the arts is *exactly* what you're wanting
to confront, right (using a refusal of contest-model funding particularly
for *small* presses as the staging ground)? Shit guys: analyze, then. &
proceed w/caution before moving into your tactical phase.

As someone you & David have both published & as someone who's published bot=
h
of you, I need you (both) to know I'm saying this out of affection, respect
& concern. (I hope it's not necessary to say it, but in case it is--I
wouldn't have joined in here if that weren't true.) There are a number of
other things to resist or struggle to complicate, in addition to capital,
that mingle with our thing: a model for community building that's based in
haphazard antagonism (largely towards, I begin to fear, affiliation) comes
to mind, for a start. That's not to say you don't have my support in doing
the work of problematizing capital, but maybe we can multi-task?

Yours,
CJ Martin

Rich,

Like Chris I too have to beg off (the semester starts a month from today an=
d I have a number of pressing projects to finish) but I will simply point o=
ut a couple of things. Since readings and contests (not necessarily the sam=
e thing) usually serve to defray the costs of publishing books, the questio=
n of journals is not as pertinent here (yes, I know there are some journal =
publication contests too). You speak of political responsibility at the "gr=
ound" level but, vis-a-vis the university system, this is a misleading and =
potentially politically irresponsible metaphor. The "complex matrix" of uni=
versity financing and funding serves, here, as a form of mystification to t=
he extent all public university financial records are public documents that=
 can be accessed and analyzed (the same is largely true for many private un=
iversities). One can, if one wishes to, "follow the money" back to its sour=
ces, savory or not. This is how many universities were forced to divest--or=
 at least acknowledge--their stocks in South African (and affiliated) compa=
nies, businesses, etc. during apartheid. Your argument thus sounds like a v=
ersion of Laurence Fishburne's character in the neo-noirish "Deep Cover": "=
the money don't know where it comes from." Finally, you continue to portray=
 poets as naive saps suckered by the po' biz--that may be true for many but=
 certainly not all. It goes without saying that none of this is a defense o=
f reading fees and contests per se (though I think it very much depends on =
the particular contest and fee--do you get the winner's book? a book from t=
he press of ones choosing? is it clear that the funds are being used to def=
ray the costs of expenses? etc.), but it is a reminder that we, those who t=
rade our labor for salaries or wages from universities (however layered the=
 degrees of labor, exploitation, and privilege), too reap the benefits of o=
thers' "ground" work...

>man, in a lot ways i think our sense of the landscape is in alignment, but=
 2 things: 1. the DTC narrative a couple msgs back was aimed at a question =
rasied by Tyrone, who asked how DTC is funded and whether or not i (we) cld=
 provide alternate models for subsidizing print (and digital) projects; 2. =
i do think that soliciting reading fees from poets is worse than _Paypallin=
g_ cash to _Lulu_ (both of which are _wildly_ problematic), but i think thi=
s for a range of reasons i'm not sure can be adequately addressed here.=20
>
>you're right to point out the distance between unflinching action & unflin=
ching rhetoric -- and i think this extends to another difference: the disti=
nction between tactical strategy (i.e. the call to refuse contests; and the=
 gesture of publicly refusing them in real time) and analysis (i.e. the sug=
gestion that contests are themselves symptomatic of deeper tendencies that =
are no less corrupt and more firmly entrenched and thus less visible, more =
permissible, etc). i agree with you (and with Tyrone) the whole way here --=
 and i don't think i've suggested anyone involved in this conversation func=
tions as the handmaiden of capital (tho i think we all, in odd ways, are, m=
yself included).=20
>
>here i need to return to that longer msg i sent out re DTC, because there =
was an essential point i fear was missed: the question of pedagogy. many of=
 us teach _in_ university systems &, as you say, far more of us have been s=
tretched across the rack by universities than taken in by poetry contests. =
but here there's an incredible difference: again, universities, however cor=
rupt (i'm thinking here of Cary Nelson's and Marc Bousquet's amazing invest=
igations into the university industry; and of course the student loan scand=
al that was splayed open by mainstream media a couple years back), are deep=
ly entrenched institutions that produce and reproduce forms of exploitation=
 that are often difficult to name and difficult to resist -- & here the dis=
tance between praxis and analysis narrows, but at the same time the extent =
to which we can intervene is also limited (i mean, you can fight city hall,=
 but can you fight city hall?). this to say, when we talk abt funding
> sources derived from institutions, we're talking abt, as i sd before, an =
incredibly complex matrix of relations that reside far beyond the immediate=
, the local, the ground. BUT (and this is the clearest point i want to make=
), when a _small_ press (a press _at_ the ground level; a press which _is n=
ot_ New Directions or City Lights or a major university press) introduces a=
 contest which solicits reading fees from poets, the gesture is clearly not=
 a good faith gesture but one that exploits the desire so many poets have s=
imply to be read with care -- and it's precisely this which i find so incre=
dibly saddening. and since we see these practices _at the ground level_ i d=
o believe we are responsible for calling them into question (analysis) and,=
 in this case, refusing them completely (tactic).=20
>
>it's far more difficult to challenge power at an institutional level -- an=
d to identify how power exerts itself through our own behaviors (viz. i mea=
nt it when i asked folks to point out my own blindspots) -- but when we ide=
ntify destructive practices at the ground level we have a responsibility to=
 name them, refuse them and (again, thanks Tyrone) offer other possibilitie=
s. in this particular case --- the case of contest culture -- we might just=
 be treating a symptom that discloses a far broader, systemic crisis, but i=
 think, at the very least, the gesture is essential. as ever, that distance=
 between institutional power and local community (and i take _this_ list as=
 an instantiation of the "local") is crucial here.=20
>
>&, Chris, when you say contests are symptomatic of deeper tendencies, as i=
 say, i agree & it's precisely here that the question of pedagogy is indisp=
ensable b/c i think the appeal to contests with reading fees as a funding m=
odel emerges out of a very particular view of what poetry is, what a "good"=
 poem is and what a successful poet is -- and it's precisely this view of p=
oetry, and cultural production in general, that has to be troubled, splayed=
 open and radically reimagined. as Pierre pointed out a couple days back, w=
hen a poet asks "how do we get a foot in the door?", this question rests on=
 a range of very troubling assumptions about what culture is, how it comes =
to us, how we respond to it and how we participate in its production.=C2=A0=

Mark,

What we are (at least I am) discussing here has nothing to do with the New
Wave religiosity you are referring here. It's completely different, related
but different from ethical values. We all know about W's "tortured" spirit,
but what does that have to do with his philosophical writings?

As for Norman Malcolm -his book *Dreaming* is one of the silliest books ever
written applying W's ideas.

Ciao,

Murat

hello, cj!

extreme, yes. evangelical? god, i hope not. insincere? i see how it could
seem so, but again, no.

i feel like something IS being misunderstood here, to a certain extent.
perhaps on both sides, i dunno. my feeling is not that getting top-down
funding of any sort -- be that institutional or sliding-scale subscription,
or outright calls for donations from rich friends or relatives -- is pure as
the driven snow. far from it. but if i am able to channel funds from a
certain source and put that to the service of printing poems and b-sides and
chaps, meanwhile throwing business to local printers and places like boxcar
press, i do feel like that's categorically different than the contest model,
which is based on growth (always got to build up and get more entries), and
as has already been said, soliciting funds from hundreds of poets who do not
have a chance at winning and are not going to get a full or fair read. i
just do.

but as i state in my blog post, i started habenicht in 2000. at that time i
worked various part-time jobs and everything came from my own dime. i
created a budget and determined this is how much i can spend on that book,
and i hustled to sell enough books to break even, more or less. now that
i've cut my teeth doing that, the funding i receive to help with kadar koli
allows me to do a SLIGHTLY larger journal, with a SLIGHTLY larger print run.
i am about to take two boxes to the post office and this will go out
entirely from my pocket. but here, i feel like, we're getting into
gradations of purity, which was not the point at all.

to me, the point is simply to LOOK AROUND at the landscape and determine
what is acceptable to you or not, as a poet, as a publisher, as a person
involved with poetry at whatever level. the reason the intervention took
place here (and on my blog) is that these are (virtual) spaces that such
people frequent. it's not a drive-by just meant to stir things up. in the
sense of spurring this discussion, which has already been both passionate
and nuanced without devolving into mindless flaming, it's already been
successful in my book. it has certainly made me rethink some of my heated
rhetoric and extreme views -- though i doubt that for me personally those
views will change, i understand better where folks are coming from -- and
hopefully for others it's done the same. but again, look around and decide
this is that i want from the poetry publishing world, this is what i don't
want. and how can i change that? what could be done differently? the
remarkable success of dos press in concert with LRL would certainly seem to
be a model that i find admirable.

in that sense i feel like we are trying to multitask, though perhaps in a
different sense than you mean -- as alongside these discussions are other
discussions and i am constantly thinking about the next phase of what all
this means in terms of action...

sincerely,

david

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CSolzhenitsyn Jukebox=E2=80=
=9D by Ann Bogle
=20
Description:=20
=20
Ann Bogle's =E2=80=9CSolzhenitsyn Jukebox=E2=80=9D is a collection of stori=
es where texts create themselves out of shreds of recollections, leaps of l=
ogic, and the constant self-adjustment of narrative imperatives; spinning t=
hemselves out in the process of going along under their own momentum. This =
is akin to what the critic and culturologist Mikhail Iampolsky referred to =
as the poetry of =E2=80=9Ccaresse=E2=80=9D.

Trevor Winkfield was born in Leeds, England and moved to New York in 1969.
He is an acclaimed visual artist who has had twelve solo exhibitions and won
numerous awards for his work.  As a review of his work in The New Yorker
said, "Winkfield's patented blend of Pop Art, Surrealism and Victoriana
remains a dependable source of formal and poetic gratification."

Miles Champion is a poet. His books include Compositional Bonbons Placate,
Sore Models, Three Bell Zero and How to Laugh (forthcoming from Adventures
in Poetry). Providence, an artist's book in collaboration with Jane South,
was published by Sienese Shredder Editions in 2008. His recent writing
appears in American Book Review, Critical Quarterly, Mimeo Mimeo, PN Review
and The Poetry Project Newsletter.

Steve Clay is an author and the publisher of Granary Books. For over twenty
years, Granary Books has brought together writers, artists, and bookmakers
to investigate verbal/visual relations in the time-honored spirit of
independent publishing. Granary's mission-to produce, promote, document, and
theorize new works exploring the intersection of word, image, and page-has
earned the Press a reputation as one of the most unique and significant
small publishers operating today.  Steve Clay has authored or co-authored A
Book of the Book with Jerome Rothenberg, A Secret Location on the Lower East
Side with Rodney Phillips, and When Will The Book be Done?

Michael Basinski is the Assistant Curator of the Poetry/Rare Books
Collection of the University Libraries, SUNY at Buffalo. His poems, articles
and reviews have appeared in numerous publications including: Proliferation,
Terrible Work, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Boxkite, The Mill Hunk Herald, Yellow

For more than twenty years he has performed his choral voice collages and
sound texts with his intermedia performance ensemble: The Ebma, which has
released two Lps: SEA and Enjambment. His books include: Idyll (Juxta Press,
1996), Heebee-jeebies (Meow Press, 1996), SleVep (Tailspin Press, 1995),
Vessels (Texture Press, 1993), Cnyttan (Meow Press, 1993), Mooon Bok(Leave

p.s. -- with regards to the question of higher education

i came to the decision to apply to an MFA program while auditing tom clark's
grad class at new college, frustrated by my inability to keep up with the
work due to my two part-time gigs. i considered going to new college --
bullet dodged there! -- and wound up at texas state because they offered me
the best deal. purely mercenary. no apologies. there were certain specific
things i wanted to study and work on in my poetry, and the stubborn
midwestern boy in me did not see the point of going into debt to do that.
while there, there were things i was unhappy with and i spoke up about them,
often to the chagrin of tom and other higher-ups.

the phd is a different beast, as you know. nevertheless, ub offered me a
good deal, again, and i felt that the blue state public university system
would be more congenial to my own sensibilities and beliefs and ability to
impact things through action. so  i am the union rep for the department and
i'm pretty active in the various ways open to grad students. we are
struggling with not only budget cuts and a devastated state revenue, but the
administration's proposed response to that, which is to essentially REMOVE
u.b. from the SUNY system -- privatize it, and with that a free hand in
raising tuition for already strapped students.

and, as with others who come to the poetics program, i felt that here would
be a vital place for my press and poetry to grow. what i'm saying is that
this is an exchange. i have no illusions about that. i'm here to get certain
things, i'm offering my energy and labor, i'm trying to make it a worthwhile
encounter for my students. i look at rich owens and his BALLADS project,
e.g., [not to mention punch press which has already been covered previously]
and i see a valuable roadmap for how i want to do this. that is, already
having certain poetic concerns, he's grounded those in careful study of
theory and primary texts which has helped that project flower into something
which, i'm not embarrassed nor hesitant to say, will prove to be some of the
more interesting work being done at this time.

that's why I'M here and i wouldn't be here if i didn't believe that, flawed
though it may be, the higher ed. system didn't have something of value to
offer and i, through it, something of value to offer in return.

sincerely,

d

Wittgenstein is of much more interest to artists and possibly philosophers
than he is to logicians and mathematicians. He didn't even understand
Godel's work, thought that the subject matter of Godel's work was not
amenable to logic, thought that because it involved the self-referential
that it was as inevitably flawed as much of the rest of the logic involving
self-reference. He read the most significant work in mathematical logic of
his day and dismissed it as nonsense.

It seems he didn't think we could say much of real value about most
interersting things. So he didn't really go for it the way Godel did.

Yu gotta at least go for it.

Wittgenstein went for it as a writer, as a kind of philosophical poet. Not
as a logician.

He was a rich guy who gave it all away. That's pretty cool. But he was
insignificant and even regressive as a logician. He missed the big boat of
his time, the boat that Godel 'started'. That grew into Turing's boat and
has sailed into now as the entirety of computing and all that has meant in
so many fields.

There's oiling spilling in the effin' Gulf,
But no worries
POETRY is where I should devote my time.
I'll raise the issue of predatory lending practices
in the Po-Biz arena.
Ruth Lilly is holding hands with a sea monkey covered in oil
But $15 reading fees are craptacular! My protest scope
shall top kill the injustice
of paying someone to read your crappy sludge
when what you really want is my now-lonely drill baby drill.

Rich,

Like Chris I too have to beg off (the semester starts a month from today an=
d I have a number of pressing projects to finish) but I will simply point o=
ut a couple of things. Since readings and contests (not necessarily the sam=
e thing) usually serve to defray the costs of publishing books, the questio=
n of journals is not as pertinent here (yes, I know there are some journal =
publication contests too). You speak of political responsibility at the "gr=
ound" level but, vis-a-vis the university system, this is a misleading and =
potentially politically irresponsible metaphor. The "complex matrix" of uni=
versity financing and funding serves, here, as a form of mystification to t=
he extent all public university financial records are public documents that=
 can be accessed and analyzed (the same is largely true for many private un=
iversities). One can, if one wishes to, "follow the money" back to its sour=
ces, savory or not. This is how many universities were forced to
 divest--or at least acknowledge--their stocks in South African (and affili=
ated) companies, businesses, etc. during apartheid. Your argument thus soun=
ds like a version of Laurence Fishburne's character in the neo-noirish "Dee=
p Cover": "the money don't know where it comes from." Finally, you continue=
 to portray poets as naive saps suckered by the po' biz--that may be true f=
or many but certainly not all. It goes without saying that none of this is =
a defense of reading fees and contests per se (though I think it very much =
depends on the particular contest and fee--do you get the winner's book? a =
book from the press of ones choosing? is it clear that the funds are being =
used to defray the costs of expenses? etc.), but it is a reminder that we, =
those who trade our labor for salaries or wages from universities (however =
layered the degrees of labor, exploitation, and privilege), too reap the be=
nefits of others' "ground" work...

>
>man, in a lot ways i think our sense of the landscape is in alignment, but=
 2 things: 1. the DTC narrative a couple msgs back was aimed at a question =
rasied by Tyrone, who asked how DTC is funded and whether or not i (we) cld=
 provide alternate models for subsidizing print (and digital) projects; 2. =
i do think that soliciting reading fees from poets is worse than _Paypallin=
g_ cash to _Lulu_ (both of which are _wildly_ problematic), but i think thi=
s for a range of reasons i'm not sure can be adequately addressed here.=20
>
>you're right to point out the distance between unflinching action & unflin=
ching rhetoric -- and i think this extends to another difference: the disti=
nction between tactical strategy (i.e. the call to refuse contests; and the=
 gesture of publicly refusing them in real time) and analysis (i.e. the sug=
gestion that contests are themselves symptomatic of deeper tendencies that =
are no less corrupt and more firmly entrenched and thus less visible, more =
permissible, etc). i agree with you (and with Tyrone) the whole way here --=
 and i don't think i've suggested anyone involved in this conversation func=
tions as the handmaiden of capital (tho i think we all, in odd ways, are, m=
yself included).=20
>
>here i need to return to that longer msg i sent out re DTC, because there =
was an essential point i fear was missed: the question of pedagogy. many of=
 us teach _in_ university systems &, as you say, far more of us have been s=
tretched across the rack by universities than taken in by poetry contests. =
but here there's an incredible difference: again, universities, however cor=
rupt (i'm thinking here of Cary Nelson's and Marc Bousquet's amazing invest=
igations into the university industry; and of course the student loan scand=
al that was splayed open by mainstream media a couple years back), are deep=
ly entrenched institutions that produce and reproduce forms of exploitation=
 that are often difficult to name and difficult to resist -- & here the dis=
tance between praxis and analysis narrows, but at the same time the extent =
to which we can intervene is also limited (i mean, you can fight city hall,=
 but can you fight city hall?). this to say, when we talk abt
 funding
> sources derived from institutions, we're talking abt, as i sd before, an =
incredibly complex matrix of relations that reside far beyond the immediate=
, the local, the ground. BUT (and this is the clearest point i want to make=
), when a _small_ press (a press _at_ the ground level; a press which _is n=
ot_ New Directions or City Lights or a major university press) introduces a=
 contest which solicits reading fees from poets, the gesture is clearly not=
 a good faith gesture but one that exploits the desire so many poets have s=
imply to be read with care -- and it's precisely this which i find so incre=
dibly saddening. and since we see these practices _at the ground level_ i d=
o believe we are responsible for calling them into question (analysis) and,=
 in this case, refusing them completely (tactic).=20
>
>it's far more difficult to challenge power at an institutional level -- an=
d to identify how power exerts itself through our own behaviors (viz. i mea=
nt it when i asked folks to point out my own blindspots) -- but when we ide=
ntify destructive practices at the ground level we have a responsibility to=
 name them, refuse them and (again, thanks Tyrone) offer other possibilitie=
s. in this particular case --- the case of contest culture -- we might just=
 be treating a symptom that discloses a far broader, systemic crisis, but i=
 think, at the very least, the gesture is essential. as ever, that distance=
 between institutional power and local community (and i take _this_ list as=
 an instantiation of the "local") is crucial here.=20
>
>&, Chris, when you say contests are symptomatic of deeper tendencies, as i=
 say, i agree & it's precisely here that the question of pedagogy is indisp=
ensable b/c i think the appeal to contests with reading fees as a funding m=
odel emerges out of a very particular view of what poetry is, what a "good"=
 poem is and what a successful poet is -- and it's precisely this view of p=
oetry, and cultural production in general, that has to be troubled, splayed=
 open and radically reimagined. as Pierre pointed out a couple days back, w=
hen a poet asks "how do we get a foot in the door?", this question rests on=
 a range of very troubling assumptions about what culture is, how it comes =
to us, how we respond to it and how we participate in its production.=A0 =

He donated $$$ to Rilke & Trakl. Pretty cool.
& impressed B. Russell.

& ended with language games ... becoming less the positivist. No, giving both
thumbs down on his early work.

His rep is still significant in the humanities (whether that means anything ???
who's to say...).

Wittgenstein is of much more interest to artists and possibly philosophers than
he is to logicians and mathematicians. He didn't even understand Godel's work,
thought that the subject matter of Godel's work was not amenable to logic,
thought that because it involved the self-referential that it was as inevitably
flawed as much of the rest of the logic involving self-reference. He read the
most significant work in mathematical logic of his day and dismissed it as
nonsense.

It seems he didn't think we could say much of real value about most interersting
things. So he didn't really go for it the way Godel did.

Yu gotta at least go for it.

Wittgenstein went for it as a writer, as a kind of philosophical poet. Not as a
logician.

He was a rich guy who gave it all away. That's pretty cool. But he was
insignificant and even regressive as a logician. He missed the big boat of his
time, the boat that Godel 'started'. That grew into Turing's boat and has sailed
into now as the entirety of computing and all that has meant in so many fields.

CHRIS &C:

tho i find myself packing boxes, parenting, copying bks before bouncing 600=
 miles from Bflo, etc -- i'm not ready to duck out of this conversation b/c=
 i see it as one worth putting pressure on.=20

that sd, Chris, i need to take issue with how astoundingly abusive, aggress=
ive and utterly patronizing the rhetorical construction of your last few me=
ssages were (i.e. "shit boys", "evangelical", "insincere", "that cracks me =
up", the tacit suggestion that i started this conversation to draw attentio=
n to DTC, etc). if we roll _back_ thru the conversation, my initial objecti=
on was to two things: 1) contests (and the _very_ particular view of poetry=
 and, by extension, cultural production that the logic of contests presuppo=
ses and promotes); and 2) the centrality the language of submission enjoys =
within the poetry industry. nor was i using Noah's Subito msg to the list a=
s a "staging ground" for some absurdly quixotic campaign to reconstruct the=
 poetry industry by way of meatheaded brute force (which is what, again a s=
ubtle but nonetheless hyper-aggressive way, seem to suggest). rather, seein=
g a mid-career poet with recognition and some measure of influence,
 however great or small, announce a contest that called for reading fees si=
mply struck me as wrong as something worth responding to -- and my initial =
response was never intended to foreclose on considering problems contest an=
d prize culture might be articulated with. =A0 =A0=20

Chris, i find myself sorely disappointed and saddened here by yr interventi=
on in this conversation because, looking back across the full range of your=
 messages, it's still unclear precisely why you intervened in the first pla=
ce --- to extend the analysis, to defend contest culture, to discourage act=
ion, to warn against absolute statements, to publicly deliver a smack down =
by way of a certain critical politesse? i mean, aside from critiquing the l=
ogic of my (tactical hence provisional) position, what are you offering her=
e?=20

when i sd no compromise i meant, quite simply, a total disavowal of contest=
 culture, something which, if i was unclear, entails dissuading students fr=
om entering contests and questioning the logic of competition in the classr=
oom, refusing to participate in contests yourself, questioning the logic of=
 prize culture when solicitations for reading fees circulate. & i don't see=
 any of this as so distracting or time consuming that it draws us away from=
 deeper or more pressing concerns (i.e. the move toward the privatization o=
f universities David points out or the linkages between university moneys a=
nd destructive corporate practices, interests, etc). opposing contest cultu=
re would also involve, as i sd in a previous msg, putting pressure on the p=
ublishers and institutions we admire to find alternate funding models and p=
articipate in practices that promote cooperation rather than competition. s=
o, if we're considering Beyond Baroque, as Catherine has, or
 Omnidawn, which publishes Tyrone and which you pointed to earlier, i see n=
othing wrong with appealing to these publishers and institutions to put an =
end to contests that call for reading fees. here, engagement by way of appe=
al seems a far more meaningful way of _supporting_ these institutions than =
simply buying books from or donating money to them. and i suspect with a ca=
refully constructed, well-measured letter of appeal signed by a wide range =
of poets, important cultural institutions like Beyond Baroque and publisher=
s like Omnidawn might rethink these practices -- and, as i say, in turn, i =
shld hope that my own compromised or complicit practices are called into qu=
estion, brought to my attention, etc.=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=20

Dear Rich--At this distance, here's what I know of your public presence in
the past week: a massive launch from DTC/Punch Press (a piece of mail for
which I'm *incredibly* grateful--holy shit the Marianne Morris poem!) & you=
r
intervention here. The first of these (the launch) is a tactic that *very*
successfully addresses the concerns you want to address & offers one of the
alternative models that Tyrone asked you to speak to. The second, as tactic=
,
is thus far just a random belligerence, as far as I can tell, even though I
understand that you & some others here don't think so. At least in its basi=
c
spirit anyhow.

I actually need to duck out of this thread for awhile & get some work done
before the semester starts back up. Desperately trying to get back to
writing a longer thing on Myung Mi Kim & Rachel Blau Duplessis--two poets
(among many) whose work would be virtually stranded by the action you call
for, unless I've somehow misunderstood your call. If I have misunderstood
it, then *please* clarify--are you asking us to walk away from any press wh=
o
runs a contest or charges a reading fee (taking w/us our money, our work,
our reviews, our venues, etc)? I mean, in addition to listserv drive-by's,
what's to be done that isn't already being done? (I'm really asking, here.
If I'm missing what the *action* is, I'd like someone to clarify.)

I also want to ask you (& David--hi David) to seriously revisit the questio=
n
of whether this type of absolutism can really be practiced from within the
funded halls of a PhD program, *while collecting a paycheck for teaching
undergraduate students who are largely going into hock to pay for their
ticket for that ride*. (I know it isn't making you rich, but come on.) I
fully understand your "top-down" theory about contests (that institutional
funding--in the form of a grant for a press (or even a fellowship,
right?)--is less questionable than the contest model because it supposedly
doesn't prey on vulnerable writers), but honestly: it's UB's listserv & UB'=
s
dime you're posting on. I'm being blunt (and maybe even a bit reductive)
here NOT because I think you should be ashamed of yourselves for accepting
that funding & using it in your small press activities--I think the
oppositein fact--but your call to action (or the way you've chosen to
articulate it?
here & in David's blog post) starts to seem not a little evangelical & even
insincere. Professionalization in the arts is *exactly* what you're wanting
to confront, right (using a refusal of contest-model funding particularly
for *small* presses as the staging ground)? Shit guys: analyze, then. &
proceed w/caution before moving into your tactical phase.

As someone you & David have both published & as someone who's published bot=
h
of you, I need you (both) to know I'm saying this out of affection, respect
& concern. (I hope it's not necessary to say it, but in case it is--I
wouldn't have joined in here if that weren't true.) There are a number of
other things to resist or struggle to complicate, in addition to capital,
that mingle with our thing: a model for community building that's based in
haphazard antagonism (largely towards, I begin to fear, affiliation) comes
to mind, for a start. That's not to say you don't have my support in doing
the work of problematizing capital, but maybe we can multi-task?

Yours,
CJ Martin

a little side note: (re Grenier/Trakl/Wittgenstein)

Robert Grenier early in his writing life translated a few (four or more)
poems of Trakl's for an anthology--

Grenier has by some been considered as a mystic; by far his greatest
philosophical interest/influence is Heidegger--

In "I HATE  SPEECH"--One might consider the context, the time period--

on the one hand, the speech driven poetics of Projective Verse and many
aspectsof Black Mountain, of the new York School--
as well as it being a time period swamped in SPEECHES--
coming from al directions and all media--

living and teaching in Franconia, NH, Grenier, while doing his daily running
as well as sitting and listeing intently for hours to the sound of water
dripping in a cistern--and to recordings of Pygmy music & sounds--

one finds Grenier developing his ear ever more acutely attuned to the
smallest particles of both speech as SOUND and as sign--
the variety of ways in which for years his works have been
published/presented, with an emphasis on the physical/visual/sonic structure
literally and literarily of the Book--
taking it apart, putting it back togther in another from--whether as huge
poster as la  M'ASS AVE or box as in SENTENCES and also the three parts
black box encased series of visual/verbl poems put out by by O Books
("Minnestoa" etc--)--
and the varying sizes and shapes of other tests--
culminating in the huge serial works done in "lawyer's office "color
markers--

in a Talk given at the Robert frost Room at Franconia--published in the late
90's--(forgive  mne for a moment here the editor/publisher escapes me--wil
come back:  Stephen Dignazio--)--

Grenier notes that an interesting question to investigate is the conjunction
between among, "only the imagination is real" of WCW's Spring and All and
the "no ideas but in things/Mr" of Paterson--

to think on /with these as a both/and rather than the usual "either/or"--

to find ways in which there is an identification of the word and thing, then
the letter and thing--so that the forming of a letter itself handwritten in
time--is an emergence/appearance of sound & image simulateneously--at the
same time as they are both physical things in action--

Olson wanted the citizen to go faster, faster--so that one thing follows on
another--the action of the poem essaying to "pull even, " equal, that is, to
the real itself"--with the action--

no more of the Aristotelian "after the fact" of writing following the
action, behind it--

but--drawing even, so that action/writing take place as nearly as possible
simultaenously--

Rimbaud already in the "Lettres du voyant" to Demeny and izambard in
1870--had written of the poetry of the Future "preceding the action"

which i have written on as being carried out literally/literarily by Rimbaud
in that his writings precede in their descriptions, images, words--the
actions which he began to live out after he stopped writing--

how many of his letters when no longer a poet carry the very images he has
written of years earlier as Poetry & Prose Poetry----and now writes simply
as bald description factual documents--

Rimbaud also wrote of the poet of the Future (also greatly effected by the
total ful emancipation of Women)--as being "not unlike the Greek"--
one notes in Grenier's studies of Heidegger the many essays re Greek thought
and poetry --

the trajectory of Grenier , his works, for some long time black listed by
his former colleagues in the 'Language-centered" writing "community"--

has been one of far more radically "outside" work & life than those of his
peers, in formal and philosophical, sonic/visual/visceral work--

Grenier's long involvements with the texts of the early Stein (which he was
teaching at Franconia--as the "Yale Stein" became available)--as well as his
studies singly, as teacher and in a reading group including Leslie
Scalapino--in Whitman--the versionsof Leaves of Grass culminating esp in The
Deathbed Edition--link him with the early modernism of WCW and the early
Stein--as wel as the 19th century Whitman--whose work was not a "once and
for all " "set in stone" text but an ongoing series of versions,
alterations, rearrangements, additions, subtractions, changes in names,
spellings, grammar, syntax--

(SERIES after al is the title of a Grenier book)--

i wd agree with many that MOBY DICK is a postmodernist so to speak text
--and i wd include the work of E A Poe as well--

D H Lawrence in his STUDIES IN CLASSIC AMERICAN LITERATURE  (which pre-dates
WCW's In the American Grain)--notes a number of times that the Americans
have relegated their classic works, in the "old American art speech"--to the
nursery--"adventure stories, : :detective tales," science-fictions stories,"
etc etc--the Classic American texts dealt with issues, ideas, images, which
the 20th century American, according to Lawrence, has to banish--to the
nursery!--

"the pure products of America go crazy" as WCW noted--

"out there"--("the figure of Outward")--though, one might say, is the as yet
hidden in plain site/sight/cite "classic american" outsider/avant-garde
postmodern etc--

("where the 'outyard" is the 'backyard' to paraphrase from Grenier's little
work on Narrative for the old Olson series--)

"The blank and ruin we see in Nature may be within our own eye"--(R W
Emerson)
"The most beautiful world is a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion/at
random"--Heraclitus

"To shut the eyes is travel"--Emily Dickinson
"My voice goes after/what my eyes can't reach"--Walter Whitman

"Writing is time travel"--W S Burroughs
"It is a science-fiction film set in the past"--Federico Fellini, on his

We have a contest as one of many measures to distribute books, these are first books by people who become somewhat famous in terms of poetry. But, its poetry, and of course, this fame is limited. As the authors become more famous we sell more books. I feel no guilt about the authors we have given accolades to, some of the better known names we published first collections and given large audience to have included---

I don't see circularity, but rather the elucidation of a tautology.
But I'm not terribly inclined to defend the argument of the tractatus,
as I don't think it's particularly useful except as an example of
where he was coming from in his later more compelling world. There are
huge flaws in the tractatus, my favorite being the summation of Prop.
7  (the famous "whereof we cannot speak, therof we must remain
silent") given by Frank Ramsey's translation "You can't say what you
can't say and you can't whistle it either."

To the drunk looking for his keys analogy, I think there's a bit of
that, and I think some of it is even intentional. That sort of
uselessness of the actual arguments is I think part of what he had in
mind in saying that the tractatus was meant to be a ladder that you
could kick away once you climbed to the top.

On the contrary, I think he doesn't think that stuff matters at all.
In fact in his journals and in the brown books, he's almost dismissive
of that part of experience as stuff that can be through empirical
science. It just isn't the proper object of philosophy to deal with
that stuff. It's empirical and there are other ways of thinking about
it that are more fruitful.

well, he's talking about propositions, which by definition are
sentences that can be true or false. Much of what precedes the quoted
section deals with what propositions are, how they work, how they
relate to facts, what facts are etc. And again, i think this is a fair
criticism because this notion of the proposition as a thing at all
arises from from Russell and Whiteheads elucidation of the predicate
calculus in The Principals of Mathematics. That said, I'm not entirely
sure I understand what the distinction you're drawing is, but I do
think that we have lots of sentences in English which aren't
propositions at all, and I think that's part of what the tractatus and
in particular the first part of Philosophical investigations is trying
to get at: that is, there are these parts of the world we can talk
about where the notions of truth and falsity apply, and there's this
other part which is more loose but that allows for a wider range of
meaning than mere propositions do, and there is a wider part of that
that carries neither truth value nor meaning and in that there are a
wide variety of kinds of meaninglessness, nonsense, and senselessness.
I don't think wittgenstein would necessarily disagree with you that
it's a mistake to consider the subject predicate syntax as somehow
decisive about the world, in fact I think the first 100 or so remarks
of Philosophical Investigations are precisely an attack on that kind
of view.

Here I think you're misreading. part of this, tho, is that he's
defined "the world" early on as a particularly limited sort of thing.
"The world is everything that is the case." again, this is part of
what he rejects later in his earlier thinking, and I don't think even
he would defend it. But it isn't precisely a recitation of the is/
ought problem per se, but rather I think a more nuanced assertion
about the nature of "oughts" themselves. It's not a skeptical idea
about moral facts, or at least its not just that, but rather a
statement about whether we're able to say meaningful things about
moral facts. Again, even the phrase "moral facts" he'd probably
disavow as not meaninful in someway, but I think the basic form of
what he'd say is "well, if you want to be a radical skeptic, go ahead,
but the statement that there are not moral facts is just as
meaningless as the statement that there are moral facts. You're still
stuck in the flybottle if you're even trying to have that
conversation. You'll get nowhere, best to come at it from a different
angle."

Also, there's an important aspect to all this that the section I
quoted doesn't mention, and that's the notion (most recently argued
for by Cora Diamond I believe) that while wittgenstein thought that
there were all sorts of things that couldn't be said, you could still
use language to show the things that you can't talk about. Sadly,
Wittgenstein never addresses CS Peirce directly in the surviving
nachlass, although I'm fairly certain he must have grappled with him
at some point because Frank Ramsey thought that there was in
pragmatism a way out of the box the tractatus seems to draw, and
there's certainly something like James and Peirce style pragmatism in
his thinking that shows up by the time he dictated the brown book, and
it's hard for me to see his later conception of "meaning as use" as
anything other than a kind of pragmatism, albeit not the kind that
Richard Rorty thought it was.

My point here again though is that what he was grappling with was a
theory of language that seemed to constantly shut down any attempts to
say things about a certain widely experienced and hugely important
aspect of human life, and I think he saw it in a nearly tragic light,
which is why I think he was so happy to describe the attribution of
meaning to certain kinds of nonsense as "bewitchment by language."
because it seems like you should be able to talk about these things,
and we feel like when we're talking about them that we're saying
meaningful things, but it's only when we reflect on what that might
really mean that we have to realize that we have know way of knowing
whether what we've said communicates what we hoped or not. As such,
this becomes a much more epistemological than metaphysical position,
and indeed I think that's how he ended up approaching the issue.

> "6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions."
>

Again, it's important to note that he's talking about propositions and
not sentences, or even more importantly signs. I think he would be ok
with the idea of ethical signifiers.

I don't see how it you can have sentence that is true or false without
it referring to an object and then predicating some quality to the
object. You don't need subject-predicate word order to get that, but
if you could give me an example of a statement that is capable of
being true or false without having some kind of predicate, I might be
able to grasp what you're getting at. To me, the fact that
propositions contain predicates seems tautological.

but when he's talking about the limits of language he means the limits
of language, not the limits of a language. he's talking about what can
and can't be talked about, full stop, not some concept that might be
expressable in one language but difficult to express in another. He's
talking about what it means for a sentence to have meaning at all, not
whether it is understood as intended. And I think part of the big
reason that Benjamin is unsatisfying to me on that score is that he
relies so heavily on intention toward signified objects, and where
that goes I follow wittgenstein into a severe skepticism about that
sort of semiotic notion. it's not at all clear what such an object is,
and if I recall correctly Benjamin uses various words for "bread" in
different languages as an example. Well ok, bread is pain is brot is
pan is lechem is naan is pita is tortilla is chapati is ... ? which do
you intend? some ideal form of bread in the mind of god? a privately
held abstraction that we take on faith is in someway similar to the
private object in the mind of another party to the conversation?
really? but what if I sit down at the table and choke a bit and say
"bread!" do i really intend that same thing even tho my meaning is
similar? no, not really, i mean, I'm choking, give me bread so i can
try to swallow. same word. same object in the real world i'd signify
by saying "this bread is excellent." completely different meaning. And
meaning is what Wittgenstein is concerned with.

On the contrary, I think he's very conscious of them. I'm not sure
what you mean he ignores them?

I'd argue with that. I think it's a succint & pithy expression of
Einstein's strong commitment to instrumentalism in scientific
reasoning, without which it has been argued he'd never have come up
with special relativity, on which his rejection of quantum mechanics
was founded (which is where that quote comes from, if I recall
correctly).

I feel like you're misunderstanding the argument though. Wittgenstein
doesn't deny that language can be extended and that new ways of
speaking and new grammars can be created. he's quite eloquent on that
point in the remarks on the foundations of mathematics. What he does
reject though is the notion that there's some completeness or
idealness of language that is possible or even desirable. rather that
language in its vagueness and uncertainty and particularity is where
it's most useful and that's how language actually gets used most of
the time unless you start getting caught up in philosophical nonsense.
Where he draws a limit, he's drawing a limit not at any existing
language, but at the possibility of meaning. Now, I'm not comitted to
the notion that he's precisely correct about where he draws the line
about what can and can't be meant (and again, this is more an
epistemological and psychological claim than it is a metaphysical
one). but i really only want to defend the notion that whereever that
line was drawn, in wittgenstein's view, and in mine for somewhat
different reasons, there is an area of human experience that is
impossible to reach at and describe with meaningful meaningful
language that is no less important for that reason, that that area of
experience is what Wittgenstein referred to as the mystical, and
probably most importantly, my own view that poetry is both capable and
may even be necessary to guide others to encounter that experience for
themselves so that we can be in some sort of communion with each other
even though we can't describe or validate it in the same way that we
could a sentence like "the earth revolves around the sun."

Fair enough. Although I'm tempted to appeal to the Death of the Author
and/or Umberto Eco's notion of machina pigra and just say that I don't
care what Ron Silliman thinks about this particular topic, on my
reading The Chinese Notebook is clearly written in a manner that is
self-consciously suspicious of the materiality of the language as
employed. (Although on that point, my own response to that poem, The
Liar Paradox, was in blazevox a few years ago and can be read here for
the curious: http://www.blazevox.org/061-jfq.pdf)

Thanks again for the fascinating conversation.

just going to chime in with my usual response to this statement that i
think he understood godel fine, i think he got the better of turing in
their debates, and that his view of what mathematics are is much
closer to what's probably right than Godel's weird platonism.

but Jim, you and I can probably go around and around about this for
the rest of a transfinite number of years and never resolve it. not
that that wouldn't be fun...

Dear Rich & David H--Sorry not to have checked in on this yesterday, as I'd
have wanted immediately to apologize for not clarifying that I meant no
personal attack by that last msg. In particular, I'm deeply sorry that I
made it seem like I was suggesting some kind of dubious connection between
the DTC launch and this thread---honestly, it never crossed my mind, but
looking back I see how it could be taken this way. In another context maybe
you'd have given me the benefit of the doubt on this, but this virtuality
tends to lift the bile---I should have accounted for that and drafted
accordingly, cautiously.

Otherwise, yeah: deadlock.

Onwards,
C

Jason, David, Jim,

This thread has become so vast, in a very good way, so that I do not know
how to respond to each (particularly to Jason's meticulous arguments),
unless I spend a trans-finite portion of my day doing it, not that that
would be a bad thing.

Jason, first let me respond to what you are saying. I think there is more we
agree with on Wittgenstein than we disagree with. My objection to him is in
the use and consequences of his rhetoric and his effect on poetry and
poetics in the United States. It narrows the possibilities of poetry,
particularly the way Language School applied his ideas. Let me explain what
I mean:

a) It is true that Wittgenstein will not deny that the subject-predicate
structure is not the only way a sentence can be constructed; but he
delegates every other structure to second class by calling it "meaningless,"
unable to be expressed as "true or false," etc. (I need to go back to the
text and choose a few more words with the same rhetorical effect).

But who has decided that the nature of *reality* consists (must express
itself) as true or false and everything else is peripheral, secondary. That
is a profound, unquestioned assumption on Wittgenstein's part the validity
of which to me is much less clear -in fact, to be honest about it, is
clearly "false."

I am more on the side of what Heraclitus says and David quotes:
""The most beautiful world is a heap of rubble tossed down in confusion/at
random."

We see truth, if at all, through a glass darkly, which also constantly
changes, is fluid. "Factual," "ethical," "pilosophical," even "scientific"
values blur are very rarely distinct (a clear demarcation between objective
and subjective basically impossible), and to build a reality structure on a
fundementalist distinction between true and false (which W. does by
privileging a prepositional view of what is real, as opposed to unsayable)
is foolhardy. A poet's job, it seems to me, is exactly to deal with that
unsayable -shall we consider ourselves to be dealing with nonsense or, as
Language School or it follower Flarf does, indulging in language games or
google games.

I do not disagree that we are may be doomed (The Spiritual Life of
Replicants deals with that issue) to grasp reality only through language
-but that *does not mean* that we have to do it by entering only through one
straight straight straight gate -the prepositional sentence.

David,
I think we agree in our view of Grenier. I was not aware Grenier's later
work was blacklisted by Language School poets. At least they realized what
he was getting at and his pursuit went awry from their approach to poetry.

Ciao,

Murat

marvelous david, thanks so much. there's a lot to chew on here, but I
wanted to remark that for me at least, I think both the connection
with Stein's early poetry so heavily laden with parataxis as it was
and with Whitmans continual revision as a connection to refiguring the
notion of the book, resonate with the sort of mysticism that I think i
see in Grenier, something akin to text as process rather than product.

this, in my thinking at least, connects up with a rather fruitless
obsessive period i spent shortly after the publication of the complete
Ted Berrigan trying to find correspondences to Alfred North
Whitehead's process philosophy in his various mundane occasional poems
(by which i mean the often repeated trope in his poetry of picking a
day or a set of activities and memorializing them in a poem eg today
in ann arbor, 10 things i do every day, memorial day, etc.). At the
end of my researches which didn't bear much out, after I got over my
disappointment in discovering the great organizing principle I thought
i'd discovered in fact was my own misreading of Whitehead, i realized
i'd been looking very much at the wrong thing and that the real
process philosophy stuff had to do more with the way he was compasing
things than with any underlying metaphysics.

anyway, Berrigan also is a favorite spiritual master of mine, and what
you're talking about in Grenier I think I see a bit in some of
Berrigan as well.

There we absolutely can agree. I think a misreading of wittgenstein
has done all sorts of harm in both the realms of philosophy and
poetry. however, i think most pertinent, and here I'll abandon a
defense of wittgenstein and just move into my own thinking, is getting
rid of the negative connotations of meaninglessness, nonsense, and
senselessness when we're talking about poetry.

I have in mind a radical sort of idea that in poetry meaninglessness
is impossible. that the way poetry works precludes an absence of
sense. and that meaninglessness in the linguistic sense that gets
outlined in Philosophical Investigations is actually a signifier of
transcendental operation of language as it bridges between the realm
of the immediately real (wherein i can stub my toe if i'm not paying
attention) and the realm of the semiotically mediated (wherein I can
write a long and angry letter to the manufacturer of my kitchen table
for putting the leg of it in such an incredibly stupid place). I think
that there is a place where those two genera overlap, and most of
human experience lies there in the overlap, but there is an outer
limit of the immediately real and the semiotically mediated that
becomes a sort of free form grammatical playground  stripped of
conventional semiotic processes on the one hand, and a transcendent
but deafening, or maybe muting, reality on the other. What I hope for,
look for, wonder about the possibility of in my own work is how to
possibly use that unattached signification of the one as a sort of
roadmap to the inexpressable other. That, to me, is the mysticism of
poetry that I wrote about in the original essay, and I think it's
related in some ways to what Adam was talking about as a new
spirituality.\

Jason,

a) A few other condescending attributions by Wittgenstein: "Nonsensical,"
"bewitchment of language." All he had to add was "young and foolish," "wet
behind the ears humanity. "Nonsensical" is a logical positivist term;
"bewitchment of language" is just a more "poetic" expression of the same
thought. Personally, I have grave doubts how far W.' moved away from his
logical positivist origins at Cambridge.

b) As transfinite sets imply, any set can finally be broken to become the
subset of another set, ad infinitum -building, breaking down and
rebuilding... That way the distinction between "language" and "a language,"
as you put it, does not really exist.  If so, there is not much difference
between Witgenstein's "Language." and Benjamin's "ideal language." In this
specific sense, in his use of the concept of "language," one might argue
that W. -the quintessential liberal Christian Jew- was a cabbalist.

The difference, it seems to me, between W. and B. is that for W. "language"
is a final absolute, therefore, unsayable. Surprisingly,
counter-intuitively, for B. "ideal language" is not. B's "ideal language
constantly breaks down, reforms, expands itself. It is a process, a
continuous one.

Here one come, I think, to Benjamin's rebuttal of Wittgenstein within the
framework, body of language itself, how language constantly, continuously
breaks out of its limits towards the unsayable -which in its turn may create
new fields of the unsayable: in the central importance of quotations and
fragments (deterioration, fragmentation) in his writing, in his rhetorical
ideal. Quotations are meta-factual. They are conjectural gestures, a
rhetoric of possibilities, potentialities. They are on the level of language
also always true (they are quoting someone) regardless of what they are
saying. By definition quotations also are always fragments, taken from a
larger whole. They need complementation (one of the constant features,
themes in this thread has been to bring in what W. said before or after the
specific discussed passage).  When quotations are placed together, the need
for complementation occurs across their jagged edges empowering the empty
space among them. This is the unsayable, spiritual space.

*The Arcades Project* resolves the dilemma, blind alley W's thought leads
us. It creates a detailed analysis of the physical, ethical, emotional,
spiritual, intellectual analysis of the past continuing into the present (he
called it "dialectical history). Here W's distinction between factual and
ethical (nonsensical, etc.) has disappeared, has been resolved (that's why
Adorno hated The Arcades Project writings so much and wanted to edit them
out -they were too "redeptive," not  positivist enough).

c) Jason, you say:
"I don't see how it you can have sentence that is true or false without it
referring to an object and then predicating some quality to the object. You
don't need subject-predicate word order to get that, but if you could give
me an example of a statement that is capable of being true or false without
having some kind of predicate, I might be able to grasp what you're getting
at. To me, the fact that propositions contain predicates seems
tautological."

As I said, The Arcades Project is such an example. Through quotations (in
which Benjamin's own ideas also function as quotations), Benjamin makes
statements (in the shape of gestures), not about "the world/ realty,"; but
about language where the distinction W. makes through abstraction does not
exist. All the dimensions of thought and experience -ethics, history, facts,
etc. etc,- blur, blend into each other. Since humanity experiences "reality"
through language and its manners of regeneration, Benjamin's method seems to
me much less nonsensical or "bewitchment" of reality than Wittgenstein'.

d) I am glad that you see words like "nonsensical, etc. should lose their
negative connotations. But, of we do so, doesn't Wittgenstein tragic sense
of life, which poets are so drawn to, basically vanish?

GREAT THREAD. THANK YOU.

marvelous david, thanks so much. there's a lot to chew on here, but I wante=
d to remark that for me at least, I think both the connection with Stein's =
early poetry so heavily laden with parataxis as it was and with Whitmans co=
ntinual revision as a connection to refiguring the notion of the book, reso=
nate with the sort of mysticism that I think i see in Grenier, something ak=
in to text as process rather than product.

this, in my thinking at least, connects up with a rather fruitless obsessiv=
e period i spent shortly after the publication of the complete Ted Berrigan=
 trying to find correspondences to Alfred North Whitehead's process philoso=
phy in his various mundane occasional poems (by which i mean the often repe=
ated trope in his poetry of picking a day or a set of activities and memori=
alizing them in a poem eg today in ann arbor, 10 things i do every day, mem=
orial day, etc.). At the end of my researches which didn't bear much out, a=
fter I got over my disappointment in discovering the great organizing princ=
iple I thought i'd discovered in fact was my own misreading of Whitehead, i=
 realized i'd been looking very much at the wrong thing and that the real p=
rocess philosophy stuff had to do more with the way he was compasing things=
 than with any underlying metaphysics.

anyway, Berrigan also is a favorite spiritual master of mine, and what you'=
re talking about in Grenier I think I see a bit in some of Berrigan as well=
.

> just going to chime in with my usual response to this statement that i
> think he understood godel fine,

o i think you're mistaken, jason, fer a change. the best thing i've read
about godel/wittgenstein is by Rebecca Goldstein at
http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goldstein05/goldstein05_index.html . if you
search it for wittgenstein, you'll come across this, for instance:

"Wittgenstein never accepted Gödel's result; he said in The Foundations of
Mathematics, posthumously published, that his task is not to discuss Gödel,
but rather to bypass Gödel. He also called Gödel's results the tricks of a
logical conjurer, logical artifices."

but the whole above url is quite fascinating. strongly recommended!

here is what godel said:

"As far as my theorem about undecidable propositions is
concerned, it is indeed clear ... that Wittgenstein did not
understand it (or pretended not to understand it). He
interprets it as a kind of logical paradox, while in fact it is
just the opposite, namely a mathematical theorem within
an absolutely uncontroversial part of mathematics
(finitary number theory or combinatorics)".


> i think he got the better of turing in  their debates,

i'm not familiar with any debates between them. sounds interesting. what
documentation exists of these debates?

> and that his view of what mathematics are is much  closer to what's
> probably right than Godel's weird platonism.

the veracity of godel's results in mathematical logic do not depend on his
"weird platonism" at all, of course, as i expect you fully understand.

godel's platonism got weird toward the end of his life.

godel starved himself to death out of paranoia about his food being
poisoned. he suffered from mental issues toward the end of his life. his
extreme platonism is associated with his period of decline, not his earlier,
more robust period, when he published his famous results. the poor guy went
off his rocker, finally.

wittgenstein was a terrific poet mistaken for a logician by some. i am
partial to such poets.

I was basically saying what David was saying. I was surprise myself; but, as
I said, found it realistic on the part of language school poets, if true.

David can answer your question better.
