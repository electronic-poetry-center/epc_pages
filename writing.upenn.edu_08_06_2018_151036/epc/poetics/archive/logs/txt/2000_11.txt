A TALE OF TWO LIT AWARDS: "The shortlists for Canada's most prominent
literary awards are often described like rival high school cliques. Giller
Prize nominees are the cheerleaders, football captains and student council
presidents with perfect teeth who wave out from the convertible at the head
of every homecoming parade. Poor Governor General's Awards nominees, on the
other hand, enjoy far less prestige, like the nerdish greasers and
trenchcoat types who hang out behind the portables, the jocks coming round
every once in a while to bloody their noses and smash their Gothic punk
CDs." - National Post (Canada) 10/25/00

It seems that Bowering's been holding out on us. A link at Poetry Daily
led me to the _Edmonton Journal_ and the news that "George Bowering of
Vancouver is up for his third Governor General's Award for his poetic
memoir _His Life: A Poem_."

I first tried to find this book when Ron Silliman raved about it here,
calling it "a real find! Poems written based on diary notes from the
solstices and equinoxes (thus four per year) from '58 to '88. In
addition to the absolute loveliness of the writing itself, you can get a
real feel for a world that is just ever so slightly distanced from your
own . . . . It feels like a great gift to read."

SPD doesn't carry it but I ordered a copy last week at Chapters (a
Canadian booksite: http://www.chapters.ca/Books/) and evil Amazon seems
to have it as well.

Now all I want to know is, what in the name of Gilbert & Sullivan is a
Governor General?

Dodie,
     You might want to look at _The body in language_ by Horst Ruthrof an
_The wounded body_ by Dennis Slattery - i'm still digesting, chewing on, or
swallowing both.  Also, Jacqueline Rose has some interesting thoughts in
_The haunting of Sylvia Plath and i'm hoping that contributor's to
Metaphor/Metonym for Health
(http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/metapho.htm) will be getting

Writers...
We Want Your Essays!

=46or P.S.1's
Special Projects Program

Year-round, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center presents a series of works by
emerging artists from around the world.  The Special Projects Program
showcases artists distinguished by the site-specific, process-oriented or
audience-interactive nature of their work.  Every 3 months, 4 new artists
are given a studio on the 2nd floor at P.S.1 . This winter, the artists are
Sharon Hayes and Andrea Geyer, John Pilson, Michael Rakowitz, Marc Lester
Yu, and Haluk Acak=E7e.

As a component to this Program, P.S.1 would like to invite writers to
contribute essays.  This writing project will be on-going, growing as more
writers submit essays and changing as new artists are featured.  The essays
will be posted on P.S.1's web site at www.ps1.org and displayed in the
galleries.  Select writers will be invited to a Public Dialogue with the
artists.  Selected essays will hopefully be featured in a possible
publication documenting the Special Projects Program.

Writing possibilities include:

o a critical essay on a (or several) Special Project artist(s) (specific to
the piece(s) on view)

o a creative essay as a reaction to a particular work of art on view in the
Special Projects
(short story, poem=8A)


Submissions should consist of no more than 1 essay of no more than 750
words and a r=E9sum=E9, and will only be accepted via e-mail.  Essays will b=
e
screened (negative reviews are not appropriate for this forum).  The Winter
Deadline is January 14th, 2001.

All interested writers should contact and send submissions to Anthony
Huberman at anthony@ps1.org

Hello, List--

I know a little something about

I will say they also have nothing
to do with SUNY Buffalo or the Poetics

if I will have a star
 i will not know where they are
i will look at them through my glass
 and analyze the gas
i will understand the clouds and vapors
 and atmospheric whirling capers
but i will miss the this
 of what will exist
 very much across the chasm in the small
 where lives are that hold us all
i will put my star chart on the shelf
 and it will be a thing in itself
so are number and thought and star
 inert and there like the star
man did not make the integers
 but uses them in heady weathers

Anyone who wants a copy of The Poetry Project Newsletter had better respond
to The Poetry Project, which was what I meant to do.

If you contact them instead of me, your newsletter is certain to arrive much
sooner. But hello to those of you who exchanged addresses with me!

Dear moderators at the Listserv:

As you know, I'm having trouble resetting my subscription, but I was
hoping that in the meantime I might offer this up as a posting to the
list.  If I can't until subscribed again, that's fine;  I just thought I'd
try this way, given our hurry to get this very late call out, at last.

Many thanks for your help in any case.

CALL FOR PAPERS

3RD RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM, TO BE HELD ON APRIL 2-3,
2001

THE POLITICS OF PRESENCE: RE-READING THE WRITING
SUBJECT IN "LIVE" AND ELECTRONIC PERFORMANCE,
THEATRE AND FILM POETRY

Following on from conferences that have considered related issues such as
poetry and
performance and poetry and the visual arts, this colloquium is designed to
bring
critics, theorists and practitioners working in a variety of media into a
conversation
focused on a specific question indirectly posed by new practices. Its purpose
is to
discuss the challenges that recent emphases on the performance of poetry have
posed
for both mainstream and avant-garde conceptions of the writing subject. Can
performance be seen to foreground the "unique" subject again, despite
postmodernism's suspicions about the "personal voice", by revealing the
disembodied
text's body - its peculiarly-located material and discursive "site" not
fully
theorised by
abstract notions of the author-function in writing? Or does performance enhance
an
increasing awareness of the "performativity" of seemingly personal
expression,
particularly when dramatised or televised, given its helpless adherence to the
symbols
and extralinguistic codes (and costs) of culture? What exactly is the presence
of the
author-function in poetry? Can one perform and politicize a "unique"
post-postmodern
subject, which by new definitions might avoid abstractions in either the
traditional or
the avant-garde sense? How do differences of race and gender complicate the
question? How does one (or should one) begin asking such a question of
electronic
poetry in performance? Is it possible to go through recent philosophy on the
subject,
to a working understanding of it in performances, as a palpable and
unreproducible
intersection between localised discourses, loyalties and limitations?
        We hope to go beyond simple expression of what it means to work in
these
various live and electronic performance modes to consider, collectively, such
questions pertaining to lyric subjectivity and intercultural politics as they
become
redefined or redeployed in old forms through new media. We also hope to
generate
unprecedented discussion by inviting and welcoming papers from people working
in
very different critical and creative registers.
        Papers delivered will be collected in planned published proceedings.
        The colloquium is run under the auspices of the Research Centre for
Modern
and Contemporary Poetry within the Humanities Research Centre at Oxford
Brookes.
Staff working in the Centre include Vicki Bertram, Romana Huk, and Steven
Matthews.
        Abstracts of proposed papers (of c.200 words) should reach Romana Huk,
School of Humanities, Oxford Brookes University, Gypsy Lane, Oxford, OX3 0BP
(email rchuk@brookes.ac.uk) by not later than 15th January 2001.

Natasza Goerke (b. 1960) has published three books of short prose
characterized by narrative experiment, absurdist humor, and her
engagement with Tibetan Buddhism. Her most recent book is <Pozegnanie
Plazmy> (Czarne, 1999). A selection of her work in English is
forthcoming as <Farewells to Plasma> from Twisted Spoon Press
(Prague, 2001).

Ryszard Krynicki (b. 1943) was a key figure of the "Generation of
'68," and was blacklisted from official publications from 1975 until
the fall of communism. In addition to his work as a poet and, more
recently, as a publisher of poetry, he is an acclaimed translator of
Paul Celan, with whom his own poetry shares an intensity of attention
to language. His work will be read in English by his translator,
Clare Cavanagh.

Piotr Sommer (b. 1948) is a poet, Editor-in-Chief of the magazine
<Literatura na swiecie> (World Literature), and a key translator of
American and British poets, including Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,
Seamus Heaney, and Charles Reznikoff. His most recent book, <Piosenka
pasterska>, was published last year. A selection of his work in
English translation is available as <Things to Translate and Other
Poems> (Bloodaxe, 1991).

CHICAGO REVIEW 46:3&4, "New Polish Writing,"  provides the first
panoramic portrait in English translation of contemporary Polish
writing, which is considered by many to be the most exciting and
diverse literature in the new Europe. This 400-page anthology, which
is the first and most comprehensive survey in English of Polish
writing since the end of Communist rule, includes material from
several generations of authors in a range of genres. Poems, stories,
novel excerpts, feuilletons, reportage, criticism, and polemicism by
more than seventy-five writers are translated in this issue. This
issue provides American readers with an indispensable introduction to
a lively literary culture, and promises to influence the reception of
Polish writing in English translation for some years to come.

* * *

CHICAGO REVIEW was founded in 1946 at the University of Chicago, and
in its 54-year history has produced several special issues of foreign
literature in translation, including <The International Anthology of
Concretism> (1967), <Contemporary German Literature> (1978),
<Contemporary Indian Literatures> (1992), <A Pacific Rim Reader>
(1993). It has become an important venue for contemporary American
writing as well, publishing issues on <Contemporary Poetry & Poetics>
(1997), and several general issues that demonstrate a "commitment to
diversity, along with an editorial insistence on provocative,
engaging writing, [that] distinguishes it from many other literary
publications in circulation today" (<Literary Magazine Review>).If
you don't find CHICAGO REVIEW at your local bookshop, you may wish to

Dear Friends, Colleagues, Friendly Strangers, and Other Recipients of This=20
Mailing,

It is with mixed emotions of joy and sadness that I make the announcement=20
that this is the final reading I will host at Blue Bar. Additionally, this=20
marks the closure of the a+bend press small books series.

The reading season for Synapse: Second Sundays at BlueBar traditionally ends=
=20
with the November reading. January 2001 will begin the next reading season;=20
and the series will continue under the new co-curatorship of Mary Burger and=
=20
Beth Murray, two local poets with a variety of interests and talents, and=20
lots of good ideas. Here is a little information about them, to serve as a=20
brief introduction:

Mary Burger is the editor of Second Story Books, featuring cross-genre works=
=20
involving innovative narrative, and Narrativity (http:=20
//www.sfsu.edu/~newlit/narrativity/), a critical forum for writers of=20
experimental narrative. Her books include Bleeding Optimist (Xurban Press),=20
Nature=E2=80=99s Maw Gives and Gives (Duration Press), and Thin Straw That I=
 Suck=20
Life Through (Melodeon). She lives in Oakland.

Beth Murray lives in Oakland where she co-edits Lucinda and The San Jose=20
Manual of Style, both with David Larsen. Her books are Hope Eternity Seen on=
=20
the Hip of a Rabbit (a+bend press), 12 Horrors (Belladonna Books/Boog=20
Literature), Spell (Lucinda), and Into the Salt (Lucinda). She has an MFA in=
=20
photography and performance from the University of Illinois-Chicago.

I hope you will continue to attend their new series with the same regularity=
=20
and enthusiasm you have attended mine, and I also hope to see you at the=20
final Synapse: Second Sundays at BlueBar reading on November 12.

This series has been a wonderful experience, a wonderful array of=20
experiences, and I will miss this happy event that has punctuated so many=20
months. It has been fun, enriching, and inspiring to work with the authors=20
and their manuscripts, meet people at readings, correspond with those=20
interested in the series, promote small press poetry and publishing, and so=20
much more. I will miss my involvement with the series and the writing=20
community--I hope to hear from you while I am on hiatus.

My hiatus, and my joy amidst the sadness of leaving the series, is due to th=
e=20
expected arrival of my first child in early 2001. I plan to begin publishing=
=20
a new (currently undetermined) a+bend press project later in 2001--if you=
=E2=80=99re=20
interested, you can watch for details at the a+bend press website, located a=
t=20
http://www.durationpress.com/abend/index.html.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in poetry and small press=20
publishing, and thank you for all the wonderful times at BlueBar.

Sincerely,

CDROM version 2.5


During the past few days, I have brought the cdrom up to version 2.5.
There are a number of new soundworks and videos on it, as well as updated
text files and probably two dozen new images. Some of the material is
reorganized as well. The soundworks include several shamisen pieces,
including one one with voice. The Talan Memmott flashwork (mobile phone
piece) is also on it, among several other collaborations. The sound files
are mp3 and wav; the video files are mostly avi. All of the material runs
on a variety of media. I've been told that the html files work as well if
the folder is moved to the Mac hard drive; everything runs on pcs.

If you're interested in obtaining this version, and you have a much older
(say 2.4 or earlier), send $10 and I'll send you one; otherwise, it's the
usual $14. I apologize (constantly) for asking money for the disks, but
they cost me, and are really the only way I can get my work around. The
cdrom has collected work from 1994-2000, as well as articles from the 80s
and even some earlier pieces.

The file below is the original advertisement, now updated - Alan



ARCHIVE (previously SUB/CON/TEXT version 2.06) CDROM 2.5 Available:

COLLECTED WORK, 1994-2000

Alan Sondheim


I've been working non-stop on putting as much of my work (dealing with
literature, psychology, cyberspace, language, sexuality, body, etc.) on
one cdrom. The result is Archive (which also includes collaborations with
Foofwa d'Imobilite, Barry Smylie, Reiner Strasser, Annie Abrahams, Talan
Memmott, and Azure Carter), available now. Archive is an enormous mass of
material - some of which is available on my website, but most of which
will be new to you.

The advantage of the cdrom, in any case, is that you can explore it at
your leisure, copy out texts and graphics, etc. It's relatively easy to
use - you can access the various directories through a browser or any
file browser such as Explorer. The cdrom was made on a PC, but because it
is only files and directories, I imagine it will open on most Macs as
well.

Includes:

30 articles, outlines of 8 talks, 450 images (approx.), a number of music
/ sound tracks, the full Internet Text (approximately 3800 pages) and
additional materials (revised The Case of the Real; Ma, a Novel), 7-8
webpage suites (including Water, Frac, Narcissistic Disturbance, etc.);
approximately 19 video segments in .avi format and one also in .rm and
.asf formats; and 61 tiny programs on basic, perl, or dialog.

The sound should be playable on most machines; the video will open in
various players as well. The texts are accessible through most browsers at
cdrom\network\index.html . The websuites will open in almost any browser;
some of them deliberately use proprietary or false tags html tags. The
texts and articles are all in text-based ascii format, which means they're
readable literally with anything; they're the core of the cdrom. There is
a readme_1st.txt which acts as a guide.

There is 'adult' material on the cdrom; please keep away from children.

I'm asking $10 + $4 shipping and handling; this helps cover the costs of
the burner, label, case, disk, and most important, the labor. Please send
$14.00 in check, cash, or money order, with a return address, to

   A quarter of the world's population, 1.3 billion people, live in
   severe poverty...
   [acorbul1.gif] Nearly 800 million people do not get enough food, and
   about 500 million people are chronically malnourished. More than a
   third of children are malnourished.
   [acorbul1.gif] In industrial countries more than 100 million people
   live below the poverty line, more than 5 million people are homeless
   and 37 million are jobless.
   [acorbul1.gif] Of the world's 23 million people living with HIV/AIDS
   more than 93% live in developing countries.
   [acorbul1.gif] More than 840 million adults are illiterate - 538
   million of them are women.
   [acorbul1.gif] Around 2 million children died as a result of armed
   conflict in the last decade.
   [acorbul1.gif] In developing countries 160 million pre-school children
   are underweight.
   [acorbul1.gif] 1.2 billion people live without access to safe drinking
   water.
   [acorbul1.gif] 110 million landmines lie undetonated in 68 countries.
  =20
   Today's society has the resources to eradicate poverty...
   [acorbul1.gif] The net wealth of the 10 richest billionaires is $ 133
   billion , more than 1.5 times the total national income of the least
   developed countries.
   [acorbul1.gif] The cost of eradicating poverty is 1% of global income.
   [acorbul1.gif] Effective debt relief to the 20 poorest countries would
   cost $ 5.5 billion - equivalent to the cost of building EuroDisney.
   [acorbul1.gif] Providing universal access to basic social services and
   transfers to alleviate income poverty would cost $ 80 billion, less
   than the net worth of the seven richest men in the world.
   [acorbul1.gif] Six countries can spend $ 700 million in nine days on
   dog and cat food.
   [acorbul1.gif] Today's world spend $ 92 billion on junkfood, $ 66
   billion on cosmetics and nearly $ 800 billion in 1995 for defence
   expenditure.
  =20
   Extreme poverty can be banished from the globe by early next
   century...
   [acorbul1.gif] The proportion of human kind living in poverty has
   fallen faster in the past 50 years than in the previous 500 years.
   [acorbul1.gif] Since 1960 child death rates in developing countries
   have more than halved, malnutrition rates have declined by almost a
   third, the proportion of children out of primary school has fallen
   from more than half to less than a quarter.
   [acorbul1.gif] Over the past three decades the population in
   developing countries with access to safe water almost doubled - from
   36% to nearly 70%.
   [acorbul1.gif] The extension of basic immunisation over the past two
   decades has saved the lives of three million children.
   [acorbul1.gif] In 1960-93 average life expectancy increased by more
   than a third in developing countries.

   Poverty is no longer inevitable and should thus no longer be
   tolerated.

In place of our own commentary, enjoy  our friend and colleague Mark
Weisbrot's wise thoughts on the presidential election and the recent
attack against Ralph Nader and the Green Party.

A Vote for Nader is a Vote for. . .  Democracy

As the election nears, Ralph Nader has drawn attention from a media
that had shown little prior interest in his candidacy. The reason:
there is a slight possibility that Nader could take enough votes from
Vice President Al Gore to throw the race to George W. Bush.

For those who are concerned about this outcome, it helps to know that
in most states-- 38 at last count-the presidential race is pretty
much decided.  So if you live in any of those states, you can vote
for Nader without fear that it could contribute to a Bush presidency.
That is the nature of our winner-take-all, electoral college system.

What about the 12 states that could go either way? Gore campaigners
have mounted a sizeable effort to convince Nader's supporters that "a
vote for Nader is a vote for Bush."
Some have gone further-- the New York Times has written two
editorials denouncing Nader for running and telling him to get out of
the race.

"You gotta love these people," said Nader in an interview with
Harper's magazine. "They think the American electoral process is a
gated community."

Ralph Nader is there to bust open the gates, as he has done
throughout his career as the nation's most famous consumer advocate.
His decades of dedicated work helped
bring us the Freedom of Information Act, auto safety improvements,
environmental regulation and other reforms that have saved millions
of lives. Now he is trying to help
bring us real democracy.

And why not? If democracy is good enough for Yugoslavia or Peru, why
not for America? While nobody steals elections here, our corporate
elite does manage to buy most of the politicians that participate.
This leaves the electorate to choose, all too often, between "two
buttocks of the same fat gentleman," as Christopher Hitchens so
eloquently described our ruling political parties.

Ironically, Ralph Nader is the candidate of the Center, if we define
that to be what most Americans support. Polls show that most
Americans want universal health insurance,
believe (correctly) that agreements like NAFTA have hurt American
workers, do not want to increase military spending, and think that
corporations have too much power. At least
of these views would prevail if we had more democratic elections.

Of course there are significant differences in rhetoric and even some
substance between the major Presidential candidates. This will remain
true so long as their parties have some different constituencies: the
Democrats after all, still have unions, African-Americans, and
women's organizations as part of their base of support.

But politics is rife with unintended consequences. Where party
allegiance is minimal and principles are as disposable as diapers,
choosing the lesser among evils is not so simple as it appears. For
example, a strong case can be made that President Clinton did more
harm in his first term than George Bush senior would have done. His
"welfare reform" worsened the plight of millions of poor women and
children. Mr. Clinton also lobbied furiously to get the Democratic
Congress of 1993 to pass NAFTA, breaking his campaign promise to
labor and environmental groups that he would not support an agreement
of this kind.

His botched attempt at health care reform that would satisfy the big
insurance companies set us back many years on this issue. And
Clinton's record on civil liberties was also worse than that of his
Republican predecessor.

All this is not to argue that worse is better. But you do have to
take into account that there are instances in which a Democratic
president can get away with socially destructive policies that a
Republican, facing opposition from traditional Democratic
constituencies, would not.

And there are a lot of issues on which Bush and Gore have the same
awful agenda. For example, both will continue the "race to the
bottom" in wages and environmental
through global trade and commercial agreements. Both will persist in
the failed "war on drugs" that has sent hundreds of thousands of
people unnecessarily to prison.
Both support increased military spending, including at least $60
billion on a Star Wars missile defense system. (Gore is somewhat more
interventionist, and if we include the IMF
and World Bank as part of US foreign policy, Gore could very well do
more damage than Bush to the rest of the world).

Given these uncertainties, a vote for Nader is more pragmatic than it
may appear. His showing in this election may prove to be more
important than the contest between the
candidates of Big Money.

Jesse Jackson is supporting the Democratic ticket, but when Ralph
Nader appeared on his television show, he closed the interview with
this advice to his audience: "Vote your interests and your dreams,
not your fears."

LYN HEJINIAN & PATTIE MCCARTHY

This event is coproduced with Poets & Writers in honor of their 30th
Anniversary Season.
We thank them for their continuing support of our programs!

LYN HEJINIAN was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and lives in Berkeley.
Published collections of her writing include Writing is An Aid to Memory, My
Life, The Cell, and The Cold of Poetry. She is currently the co-director
(with Travis Ortiz) of Atelos, a literary project commissioning and
publishing cross-genre work by poets. Hejinian and Arkadii Dragomoshchenko
wrote the script for Jacki Ochs' film "Letters Not About Love". Through her
poetry, her editing and publishing work, her translations and criticism, her
teaching and her example, Lyn Hejinian has done an extraordinary thing:
through multiple re-shiftings and stepping back, back, back, she has created
a whole new world, one in which we move now like almost-charged human
beings. The new edition of her book might well be called, Your Life, because
it and she have happened to us.

We are pleased to present Pattie McCarthy, all the way from Brooklyn, to
read with Lyn Hejinian. McCarthy is the author of two chapbooks (both 1998):
Octaves, from ixnay press, and Choragus, from Potes & Poets. Sections of her
long work, bk of (h)rs, have appeared in/on The East Village Web, Facture,
Kenning, Outlet, Poets & Poems (on the St Marks Poetry Project website), The
Washington Review, The Transcendental Friend, and elsewhere. With Kevin
Varrone she edits BeautifulSwimmer Press. Hers is a thrilling new voice; and
bk of (h)rs is a majestic, charming and incisive reconcoction of illuminated
European religious documentary, albeit with a way-beyond-modern urban glare
that stamps it American.

intended primarily to be read/seen on the internet, exploring at least in
part innovations available by the medium--can be found.  Any suggestions on
where I might look?

Nikuko tells the truth


"I haven't written anything in a long time, or, rather, I write daily. But
it's not enough. I'm jealous of all of you pushing the boundaries of new
media, university-connected, with the latest equipment available, help
just around the corner. I'm jealous of beautiful moving things on the
screen; my own Archive cdrom is clumsy, brute directory organization, as
if the back-and-forth jump-start were sufficient. Minimalism and the work-
load died out a long time ago, yet both of these are rampant in the piece.
I'm jealous of collaborations; my miniscule perl or qbasic programs permit
nothing. Looking at still images, reading lengthy broken - but not anima-
ted or activated - texts, seems almost a waste of time, the dissection of
a corpse (whose demise I announced decades ago). The tiny quicktime flics
are still-born as well, almost invisible clumsy actions, as if the low
bandwidth format were somehow still in vogue - instead of an indication
of the poverty of the author. I can extrude neurosis, body, sexuality, out
into the world through the most minimal of images - but without followup
and the wonder of movement, everything is lost in poverty. I retreat in an
attempt to argue that such poverty indeed carries the force of truth - but
in fact, all it carries is emptiness, poor thinking, organization, and art
in the face of capital and new media. I'm jealous of everyone who is able
to go to new media conferences, meet up again and again with old friends,
display their work. I want to be part of the community; I want people to
see the life in my works, rise above the barrenness. Clearly this is ask-
ing too much; my work courts death more than anything it seems, with de-
pression coming in a close second. No one wants to read about depression
or depressively, no matter how good the literary sense or theoretical work
- it understandably goes for naught. I look at new media work and see
brilliance and light and laughter and late-night meetings and discussions;
I look at my own work and see programming ignorance, poverty, and the
morgue. No wonder it's cast-off, cauterized, ignored; it's caught between
literatures which clearly need not pay it attention, and multi-media -
from which it is permanently and humorlessly estranged. This work no long-
er stands on its own; it no longer has a place in the cultural world. It
continues to be produced, only because of the addiction I bring to it, and
it cannot last all that much longer, already lifeless and buried," said
Nikuko, alone in that bar in that city.

               ****New from Thorp Springs Press****

                 A M E R I C A N  R A M B L E R

                              by
                              Dale Smith

Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca traversed unknown lands in nine years. He was
thirty-seven at the outset.  In 1527 he left Cuba as treasurer of the
ill-fated Narvaez expedition to Florida. Stranded on a makeshift raft, he
was washed onto a Texas beach and saved by indigenous tribes there.  That
same year, Ferdinand was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague. Rome was sacked,
leaving 4000 dead. Pope Clement VII was imprisoned in the Castel Sant’
Angelo. It was called by some the end of the renaissance.

In AMERICAN RAMBLER, Smith weaves a narrative of encounter, submission and
ultimately transformation on a continent as unknown to the Spanish castaways
as they were alien to it.

                                  *

Praise for AMERICAN RAMBLER

"Heraclitean...the way back and the way down are the only still open." --
Diane di Prima

"Beautiful! Phrasing, shape, cover, clarity, form, observation, information,
words, generosity, a ‘Total Work’" -- Joanne Kyger

"I loved everything about this book. The cover and illustrations by Philip
Trussell are perfect. The opening..., (3-IV-99) and American Rambler so
powerful...‘because there is a wilderness to change us’ takes us by the hand
into the rest of this fine work. Terra Incognita superb." -- Lucia Berlin

                               *

AMERICAN RAMBLER is available through Small Press Distribution

Dale Smith lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife, the poet Hoa Nguyen.
Together they edit Skanky Possum, a magazine of poetry and criticism. His

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  I went to this great reading the=20
other night here in San Francisco and want to recommend everyone buy=20
this one book, "Uncle Chen's Oriental Slapstick" by Chris Chen.  It=20
is published by INCIDENTAL PRESS, PO Box 423058, San Francisco, CA=20
94142-3058 and it costs $6.  The title makes it sound a bit silly but=20
it is not, I'm finding the book very provocative and stirring, one of=20
the best books of poetry I've read in quite a while.  In person Chris=20
Chen is a tall well built fellow who might have been a bit nervous=20
reading through most of his book, I'm glad I sat in the front so I=20
could hear it all pretty well.  In one dramatic section of the poem=20
he was assisted by Pamela Lu, who played the Narrator, while he=20
(Chris) played Buddha and Chris Daniels played Socrates.   But mostly=20
it was just him.

In other news I hope all of you bought the October issue of MS.=20
magazine.  On the cover was my cousin Sarah Jones, a wonderful poet=20
slash performance artist slash Ruth Draper type who also stars in the=20
new Spike Lee movie "Bamboozled."  She is amazing!!!

New Yorkers who are free on Saturday afternoon November 18 should=20

friends and lovers in the wholesome glossy imagery? Our relentless=20
drive towards visibility seems to have given us more than we wanted,=20

films and tapes, who eschew the plastic in favor of the pariah, and=20
who insist on a vision that=92s both wild and reality-based.

Bypassing queer theory and inventing new dialogues, this work goes=20
back to the source -- to pre-liberation homosexual identity and all=20
the problems and imaginative solutions entertained therein. New=20
trajectories from the olden days to the present are provided: high=20
school quandaries, genuine Internet sex, identity vampires,=20
unfocussed glamour, and nostalgia without irony. The 5 films and=20

that acknowledge the theories of academia, but also maintain that=20
each new generation remains completely at odds with the world=20

Screening order and tape descriptions

Chisholm (Robby Abate, 1999, US, 10:00, 16mm, color, sound, 10 min.,=20
world premiere)
High School graduation is a milestone of adolescence, and often the=20
point of no return for many who are rendered so completely clueless=20
about the next stage of their lives that they experience a cultural=20
and sexual free fall. The scene is a rented room in a motel. The film=20
takes place within the consciousness of adolescent homosexual=20
awareness, and represents the first stage in knowing who is the=20
sexual self, and what desire looks like.

Oblivion (Tom Chomont, 1969, US, 16mm, color, silent, 4-1/2 min., vintage)
An expertly edited blend of elements from both poetic and diary=20
modes, this is an erotic, passionate film that creates a shimmering=20
fantasy of love. The film induces a sense of "oblivion" or=20
forgetfulness as the exquisitely beautiful love object draws the=20
viewer into his own deeply personal and sexy world. Don=92t forget to=20
wear your 3-D glasses!

Ritual (Tracey MacCullion, 2000, US, 16mm, b&w, sound, 8 min., world premier=
e)
Imagine the terror of discovering on one=92s own college campus a=20
kinship of bloodsucking students enraged by contagious enigmas of=20
sexual identity. The student body invades itself. It is made mad by=20
lust for death and longing to become the other. An experiment in=20
horror, it combines Dario Argento=92s brilliantly questionable=20
narrative logic and George Romero=92s exercises in psychologically=20
inspired camera work - and is an oblique homage to both.

Come Softly (Robby Abate, 1999, US, video, color, sound, 11 min.,=20
world premiere)
Constructed of footage from the Internet including Internet porn=20
newsgroups, live video conferencing, CNN and government sites, this=20
tape exploits the Internet with a voyeur=92s passion. It also analyzes=20
porn sites as a cultural site where a new kind of sexual alienation=20
is invented, and where one can experience total loss of intimacy.=20
This becomes a personal disaster, which is compared in scale to one=20
of the most destructive airplane crashes in history, TWA=92s Flight 800.

Taking Back the Dolls (Leslie Singer, 1994, US, video, b&w, sound, 43=20
min., millennium premiere)
A lesbian tale of high glamour, low camp, sex, drugs and supermodels.=20
Sound familiar? The story is inspired by the 1966 Jacqueline Susann=20
novel, Valley of the Dolls, and scripted from scenes in the novel,=20
from Vanity Fair magazine articles and other pop Americana. Finally=20
infused with heavy doses of lesbian and gay male sex, love and=20
psychodrama, Singer takes back the story - from Vanity Fair, drag=20
entrepreneurs and pop culture vultures, and re-places it in a=20
feminist homosexual context, where it belongs!

Bios of film/video makers

Robby Abate is a media artist from New Haven, Connecticut. He=20
graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art with a BFA in=20
Sculpture and New Media. Robby works in film, video and the Internet.=20
His work has been screened at independent and experimental venues in=20
Boston, Chicago and New York.

Tom Chomont lives in New York, and has been making films since the=20
early 1960s. His films and tapes are both diaristic and trance=20
inducing. His work is deeply personal, crafted with amazing=20
tenderness, and filled with dense poetic imagery. Chomont is nothing=20
less than an icon.

Tracey MacCullion is a filmmaker from Boston, Massachusetts who=20
studied film at the Massachusetts College of Art. Tracey has worked=20
extensively in Super 8 and is currently producing her third 16mm=20
film. Her 1998 film Gash was presented at the most recent Whitney=20
Biennial.

Leslie Singer began her film career in the underground performance=20
and Super 8 art scene in San Francisco in the early 1980s. Films from=20
this period were screened recently in the Museum of Modern Art=92s "Big=20
as Life" series. Her video works have been screened internationally=20
at artist=92s spaces and in film and video festivals. She is co-founder=20
of Creative Capital, a non-profit organization for artists.

There's a new little bit of mine on www.ubu.com that I'm rather keen =
on.
It's part of a collection of essays concerned with internet poetry to =
be
published in the Canadian journal Open Letter, edited by Darren
Wershler-Henry.  Other very interesting essays there by the likes of
Wershler-Henry, Neil Hennessy, Loss Peque=F1o Glazier, damian lopes and =
the
mysterious "UbuEditor," among many others.  Check it out.

from "Reflections on Cyberpoetry"

A big fish, renowned in his small pond for the accuracy of his =
stop-press
information of literature, complains to me of a growing pococurantism.
"Since the Language Poets came in, I can read nothing else. I have =
finished
Hejinian, and I do not know what to do." I suggested that the great =
Russian
was an admirer of Pushkin, and that he also might find that author =
readable.
"But Pushkin is a romantic; Hejinian is indeterminate." I reflected on =
the
aphorisms of My Life, but forbore to press the point, and I proposed It =
Is
Never Too Late to Mend. "But one cannot read the Europeans at all!" =
While I
was extracting the virtues of the proposition that Pushkin was not =
European,
while McCaffery is nearly a French post-structuralist, he added that he
could no longer read any verse but cyberpoetry.

It is assumed that cyberpoetry exists, though whether as a subset of =
poetry
or the larger sphere in which literature exists, we are not sure.

It is assumed that cyberpoetry is nearly a school; that it almost =
consists
of certain theories; that its group or meta-groups of groups or groups =
of
meta-grouped groups of meta-practitioners will either revolutionize or
demoralize or democratize poetry if their attack upon the book meets =
with
any success, even a smidgen. It is assumed that cyberpoetry is created =
by
people with hands, feet, and incomes, hence our paranoia.

Cyberpoetry does not exist, and it is time that this preposterous =
fiction
followed the trace, the spectacle, the rhizome, the libidinal economy, =
the
paradigm, the sememe, phoneme, grapheme, little Miss Prision and the
eighty-thousand North American progressive dadaists into oblivion. Why =
not?

New York, New York

(Information/Reservations: please call the Kosciuszko Foundation
office at 212.734.2130)

* * *

NATASZA GOERKE (b. 1960) has published three books of short prose
characterized by narrative experiment, absurdist humor, and her
engagement with Tibetan Buddhism. Her most recent book is <Pozegnanie
Plazmy> (Czarne, 1999). A selection of her work in English is
forthcoming as <Farewells to Plasma> from Twisted Spoon Press
(Prague, 2001).

RYSZARD KRYNICKI (b. 1943) was a key figure of the "Generation of
'68," and was blacklisted from official publications from 1975 until
the fall of communism. In addition to his work as a poet and, more
recently, as a publisher of poetry, he is an acclaimed translator of
Paul Celan, with whom his own poetry shares an intensity of attention
to language.

PIOTR SOMMER (b. 1948) is a poet, Editor-in-Chief of the magazine
<Literatura na swiecie> (World Literature), and a key translator of
American and British poets, including Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,
Seamus Heaney, and Charles Reznikoff. His most recent book, <Piosenka
pasterska>, was published last year. A selection of his work in
English translation is available as <Things to Translate and Other
Poems> (Bloodaxe, 1991).

* * *

CHICAGO REVIEW 46:3&4, "New Polish Writing,"  provides the first
panoramic portrait in English translation of contemporary Polish
writing, which is considered by many to be the most exciting and
diverse literature in the new Europe. This 400-page anthology, which
is the first and most comprehensive survey in English of Polish
writing since the end of Communist rule, includes material from
several generations of authors in a range of genres. Poems, stories,
novel excerpts, feuilletons, reportage, criticism, and polemicism by
more than seventy-five writers are translated in this issue. This
issue provides English-language readers with an indispensable introduction
to a lively literary culture.
[Supported in part by a generous grant from The Kosciuszko
Foundation: An American Center for Polish Culture]

* * *

CHICAGO REVIEW was founded in 1946 at the University of Chicago, and
in its 54-year history has produced several special issues of foreign
literature in translation, including <The International Anthology of
Concretism> (1967), <Contemporary German Literature> (1978),
<Contemporary Indian Literatures> (1992), <A Pacific Rim Reader>
(1993). It has become an important venue for contemporary American
writing as well, publishing issues on <Contemporary Poetry & Poetics>
(1997), and several general issues that demonstrate a "commitment to
diversity, along with an editorial insistence on provocative,
engaging writing, [that] distinguishes it from many other literary
publications in circulation today" (<Literary Magazine Review>).If
you don't find CHICAGO REVIEW at your local bookshop, you may wish to
consider ordering copies directly for $8.00 each plus shipping.

More material on America's best known rumor.  Nice poem, too.

hundreds of publications with work forthcoming in: Rattle; Clay Palm
Review; Yefief, Buckle&, and New York Quarterly.  He is Editor-In-Chief

  Election Night Flashback


She sits behinds you in the back seat
and plays with a flap of loose upholstery
as you tell her you're sorry, but it's for the best.

You're a drunk and a discontented rich-boy
who's only known how to spend daddy's money
on fast highs.  You explain as she sobs

and stares out the window through another Texas
night speeding by, how she's not to talk to anyone
about it or your father will cut you off.

Crossing fingers you hold the steering wheel and
pray she appreciates the extra padding in the envelope.
You don't love her, but you go with her to make sure

she doesn't chicken-out-- that the job gets done.
The doctor's an old friend of the family; he knows
the value of discretion.  You may be a drunk,

but you believe _political_ suicide is a bigger sin.
You can't marry a girl who out-snorts you,
out-drinks you, yet doesn't take the pill.

She's doesn't know from pillbox hats, couldn't
carry YSL, looks terrible in pink, and gray.
She's not First Lady material.

  With a sore derriere.

He put some in his pipe,
And smoked it in the hall,
        And that’s all.




AMERICAN BEAUTY


Somewhere along the line, they get squashed down. Then something
happens that promotes change. What is important is that I project an
image of success at all times. I like to watch movies. Watching this
movie about the unbearable beauty of a white plastic bag turning in
the wind that arrives before a storm, I have an ideal in mind. Like
a Greek ideal. There is an entire life behind things to see.
Somehow. This afternoon I saw "American Beauty." I've seen Kevin
Spacey several times before, but, well...I loved "American Beauty."
It's good I'm sure. Though I'd never seen it before. Perhaps what I
really need to do is quit my job or pump iron. It's something to
think about. And I've already read "The Nature of Things." I'm
really terribly tired, you know. Daily every day I must go through the
discipline of overcoming unprofitable thinking, for I don't know
why. But I do. "I do." Maybe from a metaphysical viewpoint I could.
Frolicking has never been so depressing. Conspicuous consumption
makes our love stronger. Gardening always takes a back seat to
science. I know what I need: to understand the harmonious mind of
God. So I can see where he went unharmoniously. See? There is so
much seeing to do. And already today I'm so terribly tired. Note to
self: Always get a contract when working with a dark, omnipotent
power. What else could I do? I'm going to buy a CD which voices a
healing, life-giving message! Or else a Barry Manilow CD. If only I
had a CD player, I'd buy both. If only I had the money. You see, I'm
not asking for anything to change, really. I just want to "see" as
is. The movies will lead us out of despair by making us see. David
Denby said something to that effect once. I read it in quotes. I
think. Not certain. Couldn't be absolutely sure. This I know:

I remember all my life. Raining down as cold I am. Shadows on the
   hills.
Faces through windows. Crying in the night. It was just another.
It was a foll, it was a fool, it could be alright now perhaps.
I can't be making myself of your bat.
Oh Mandy you gave me and you gave that keeps shaking I need it.
I remember all my life. Raining down as cold I am. Shadows on the

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

vote tuesday....gore has GOTTA win, get out the vote!

tomorrow!

bring your friends, call a friend ....pennsylvania is a crucial swing state
with a lot  of electoral votes, and the philadelphia gore votes have to turn
out to offset the rest of the state

i saw gore speak yesterday in fairmount park at memorial hall, and i saw
nader speak last week at the church at 21st and chestnut, and i really like
what nader says, but it is so crucial for gore to win. the next president
will appoint 3,4, or 5 supreme court justices, and this could shape the
direction of our country for the next 40 years.

gore is pro-choice, and bush is against abortion. roe v. wade would probably
be overturned if bush wins, making abortion illegal. this would give rise to
backstreet abortions where many innocent women will get hurt

bush is totally representing the richest 1 percent of the population, and
gore represents the middle class....bush would essentially eliminate
progressive taxation, a windfall for the wealthiest of the wealthy, at the
expense of the rest of us.

bush is the embodiment of money/corporate greed buying political power,
diverting the democratic process, away from the will of the people

a lot of people have been talking about nadertrader.com, a website, dedicated
to the idea that people in stated where the race is very close can vote for
gore, while people in states where it is already decided  can vote for nader,
to try tpo get nader the 5 per cent he needs to get funded for the green
party for next time (and to help build a third party for after the election).
this website lists the current swing states. current swing states on their
list are, wash., ore., minn., mich., iowa, ohio, pennsylvania, florida,
tenn., west virginia, missouri, arkansas, new mexico, new hampshire, and
maine....some other lists i've seen include illinois and indiana. washington,
oregon and wisconsin have nader getting 11 or 12 percent.....these three
states are also where the GOP is running an ad with nader in it...

when i saw nader speak, he definitely looked like he will not be dropping out
of the election at the last minute

what will gore do for us?
well, he seemed very sincere, that he is going to fight the big drug
companies, to fight for the people. gore talked about the diversity of our
country, respecting the various backgrounds of people, but then seeing the
common humanity that binds us, and he emphasized the dignity of the
individual.....this is code for a whole slew of things, like taking care of
the needy.

gore has a conscience, his dad, was one of the first to speak up against the
vietnam war, and even though he was a senior senator, lost his senate seat
because of taking this controversial position.....he comes from a background
of standing up for what is right, even if it's risky politically.

there are so many issues that effect millions of people, and the kind of a
society we will have - campaign finace reform, a "bill of rights" for HMO
subscribers, housing, the environment.

but this is just a quick note to remind people to vote, and this time it's
close, and important.

remind your friends, bring friends with you to go vote, but actually go and
vote!
ask a neighbor where to go to vote!

-josh

A small number of posts to the list from

those fateful missives have just arrived

A vote for Gore is a vote for the DLC, and a vote for the DLC is a vote for
corporate America.  Period.  Lieberman is currently head of the DLC; both he
and Gore - and Clinton, for that matter - were there at its inception in the
mid-80s.  The DLC is how corporate America makes Gore a lesser evil (yes,
"they" think that way too, except rather than having to vote for a lesser
evil, they are able to ameliorate a candidacy revolving around social
justice via monies that are then used for ads that commend social justice as
a priviledge rather than a right) - but anyway, corporate funding shoves
centrist/right ideals down the throats of more traditional (laborite)
Democrats whose moral fibre nevertheless doesn't restrict their desire for
endless November victories.  A vote for Gore is thus a vote that is
extremely compromised; he isn't the lesser of two evils, he represents (and
IS) the same evil.  But folks will vote for Gore despite him and it (the
vote) being compromised, because it's a compromise they feel they may have
more control over than a vote for Bush, which is a vote for national
collapse, covered by a lot of flag-waving.  Bush, after all, is just the
leering tatoo on the prophylactic covering the Big Machine of Cheney & Co.
(& Daddy Dear ... )  Some DLC specifics -

a 1991 DLC hob-knob with the likes of Philip Morris, Nabisco and AT&T board
members in Cleveland was supported in part by a $50,000 "donation" by a top
Ohio Republican (much to the chagrin of Howard Metzenbaum); at the time,
Bill Grey, a Demmie from Pennie noted that the DLC's "stand" on affirmative
action "sound[ed] a lot like David Duke."  Through the 90s, traditional
Demmies rejected DLC "New Democrat" policies as moving too far to the right,
and, tho the constituency of the DLC narrowed, it didn't exhaust the power
surge of that organization, wch, secure in its corporate funding, continued
as a kind of elite secret society within the party; joining w/ republicans
to shove NAFTA down the throats of the working class resulted in the
electoral debacle of '94; the evident "failure" of "traditional Democratic
values" (wch were media driven and absent) put the DLC in the party driver's
seat, and they've been heading in an increasingly corporate-friendly
direction ever since.  So,

where do these guys get their money?  Ha ha.  Bank One, Citigroup, Dow
Chemical DuPont, GE, the Health Insurance Corporation of America, Merrill
Lynch, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley,the National Ass'n of Mortgage Brokers,
Occidental Petroleum, Raytheon, etc.  Al & Joe's working class rhetoric is

completely hollow.  This needs to be said several times.  Completely hollow.
  Completely.  They are both go-boys from the Office at the Top, the
Principles Office, out to wreck the constitution and calling it "moving
forward."  No one's saying what's on the horizon (a "better America"); it's
all gesture and grand distraction, Xtian hope, piety and The Chair for
anyone who says or does otherwise.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it's
more-than-obvious

that this campaign is scripted from the top down.  It isn't even close.  Or
it's too close to call.  Fuck 'em; who cares?  What to do.  Keep pushing
Nader, I guess, and hope for increasingly confrontational demonstrations
against the WTO and all that.  Scare tactics, like military roads, can work
both ways.

Dodie,

One book you ought to look at, for an overview, that is, is Elaine Scarry's
_The Body In Pain_. And you might want to wander into the wilds of medieval
representations of the body, which are truly weird. Check out Julian of
Norwich's _The Showings_ (aka Revelations of Divine Love), as well as the
substantial recent literature on her, esp. by medieval scholar Nicholas
Watson. Also, Sarah Beckwith's _Christ's Body_ is a brilliant examination of
Margery Kempe and the way she used her "extreme" behavior to contest male
authority. (Of course, there's Bob Gluck's book on MK, too).  Gretel
Ehrlich's _A Match to the Heart_ is an intriguing (though at times precious)
account of surviving a lightning strike: a kind of resurrection narrative
about learning to re-inhabit the body.

Sounds like a great class!

The Biennual Conference for Contemporary Literary Translation will
be held at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey,
(one subway stop on the PATH from Manhattan) on 17-19 November 2000. Most
of the conference involves sessions on translation theory and contemporary
poetry, including special sessions on Portugese, Spanish, French,
Romanian, Turkish, and Russian poetry in our time.=20

A great number of important contemporary poets (including, to select at
random, Murat Nemet-Nejat, John High, Kristin Prevallet, Simon Pettet,
Arkadii Dragomoschenko, Carmen Firan, Leonard Schwartz, Susan Nash Smith,
Timothy Liu, Mustaf Ziyalan, David Curzon, Julia Kunina, Susan Clark,
Burt Kimmelman, Zhang Er, Charles Cantalupo, Marcella Durand, Vadim
Mesyats, and many others) will be participating together with some of the
most celebrated translators working today.=20

Among participants are two of Russia's best younger poets, Alexandr
Skidan (who is also the Russian translator of Paul Bowles) and Dmitry
Golynko-Wolfson (who is widely known as a theorist of poetics as well as a
poet). Keynote addresses will be delivered by Earl Jeffrey Richards of
Wpperal University and Serge Gavronsky of Barnard College.

There will be special readings Saturday evening by distingished senior
poets Nina Cassian and Samuel Menashe.

Registration for the conference is $15, but it will be WAIVED in cases of
"hardship" (a category into almost any of us, in this case, might fit).
We'd much rather that anyone attending save their $$$ to attend the
Saturday evening dinner, which at $7.50 would be a bargain by any
standard.

Please plam to be there to meet and hear some terrific poems and
translations and meet some wonderful people.

If you need directions to the campus, please contact me
at talismaned@aol.com and let me know if you want directions for driving
or for taking the bus, the subway, or the ferry.

is pleased to present a poetry reading featuring

Kristin Prevallet

and

Hank Lazer


7:30 pm, Tuesday, November 14
Ellis Marsalis Jazz Studio
New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA)

New Orleans, LA

*******************************

New York poet KRISTIN PREVALLET also writes essays and translates from the
French.  She is the author of _Perturbation, My Sister_ (First Intensity
Press, 1997), in which she uses collages by Max Ernst as inspiration, and
_Selections from the Parasite Poems_ (Barque Press, 1999).  She works as a
teacher in Brooklyn.  Of _Perturbation, My Sister_, Anne Waldman says,
"Transfigurations of the divine & perfunctory, a radical vision of Ernst's
dramatic & exquisite corpse.  Brava!"

*******************************

For over twenty-five years, Alabama poet and literary critic HANK LAZER has
published poetry in many of America's leading literary magazines and
journals.  Among his many books are _Doublespace_ (Segue, 1992), a
collection of poems written in several deliberately conflicting styles, and
_INTER(IR)RUPTIONS_ (Generator Press, 1992), a series of ten collage-poems
which incorporates a wide range of layouts and materials, from baseball
batting averages to critical theory, from fashion and interior design
columns to research in neurophysiology.  David Ignatow calls _Doublespace_
"a noble attempt to bridge the chasm between Language poetry and the
traditional anecdotal and meditative poetry of the 'free form' mode."
Susan Howe claims that the book "returns to unsettle American cultural
inheritance."

*******************************

This event is free and open to the public.  A reception and booksigning
will follow the reading.

Hello Everybody!

I know I've dropped off a bit on the poetics list in the last few months,
but I've been busy making books and putting more issues of INTERLOPE
magazine out into the world.

For those of you who aren't familiar with INTERLOPE and for those of you
whose memories might need a bit of a jog, INTERLOPE is a twice-a-year
magazine dedicated to publishing innovative work by Asian American writers.

__________________
Why is there no poetry cookbook *anthology*? One is needed, and the
need is urgent.

Consequently, poets Nada Gordon, Kent Johnson, Hoa Nguyen, and Joe
Safdie have set forth to edit a cookbook of recipes, culinary stories, and
food poems.

Our selections will be made on the basis of the overall quality and
originality of the submissions, with special attention being given to
the gastronomical charm of the recipes. About 50 poets, along with their
recipes, anecdotes and poems, will be included. All proceeds (beyond
printing and publishing costs) will be donated to Food and Water, a
national political action organization/publisher that campaigns against
toxic food technologies such as food irradiation, pesticides, and
genetically modified organisms (GMO's).

We think this could be quite a successful book -- and a dinner party, so to
speak, gathered around a big table of poetic affection and filiation
(well, sort of). It will certainly be an unusual and tasty project!

The people we solicit will make up a majority of the contributors, but
if you're interested in this project, please tell us so by replying to
this e-mail address and we will send you the contributor guidelines as soon
as they're formulated. (This will be a leisurely project, and we'll
probably be collecting submissions through Thanksgiving of 2001).

Yours in nourishment and delectation,

Nada, Kent, Hoa and Joe

Dodie, all:

I'm thinking a lot about Jamaica Kincaid, her relationship to her body, her
love of her own smell, from book to book.  I think Lucy and At the Bottom of
the River deal with this most, the awakening body, about to emigrate, to
become post-.

There is also a book called Smell, by Radhika Jha, which is all about the
post-colonial body of a young Indian woman coming of age in Paris, having
issues with her smell.  She thinks she stinks; men think she's exotic.  It's
not a very well-written book, in my opinion, but raises some interesting
questions that sharper minds with pens can take further.

The French feminists, of course, Wittig, Cixous, etc.

Aime Cesaire's Le Corps Perdu.

Then the cyborg workers:  Theresa DeLaurentis, Donna Haraway, and Bhanu
Kapil Rider (published by Leroy just a few months ago!)

Jeanette Winterson.

Ginu Kamani's Junglee Girl collection of stories.

When Fox Turns A Thousand, a novel by Larissa Lau.  Shape and gender
shifting.

Fat? So! (collection of creative nonfiction).

The Body in Pain, I believe is the title of the book.  I can't remember the
author, but I sent a copy to Rachel Levitsky last year.  Rachel?  Oh, wait,
Scarry.  Elaine Scarry?  Somebody Scarry.

Down Below, by Leonora Carrington.  Amazing chronicle of body-brain
disassociation and partial reunion.

HOGG and Madman, by Samuel R. Delany.

Tipping the Velvet, I think?

Books on cutting?
Some of Marci Blackman's work, or excerpts from her novel, Po Man's Child,
could be instructive in this regard.

Subject:      phenomenology
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

-


phenomenology


intranet net internet: the middle term as an intersecting node, mobile
within the latter, and the phenomenological horizon within the former.

model the internet on a sphere; there are no end-points, no dead-ends,
no terminals. or rather, the terminals, dead-ends, end-points are thick
like the irrationals on the continuum - everywhere across the globe.

who, why, when, where, what, how: interrogatives which traditionally
appear in relation to events within classical space time: where / when
for example presuppose a discrete occurrence located within a cartesian
grid.

now _where_ is moot: everywhere and nowhere, tied to the ontology of
data. _when_ is a stuttering legacy of routers which may or may not
possess a discrete origin on the emission spread, dissemination.

_who_ likewise, referencing one or many or a spread across individuals,
often remains indeterminate; think of _doxa_ or the _they._ but think
as well of _which,_ choosing among an already predetermined collectiv-
ity, and the problematic of _which_ online.

_what_ likewise presupposes a discrete _phenomenon,_ which may be class-
ically described; _what_ on the net references, instead, a _weather_
with immersed observers, participants, or unknowns.

_how_ stutters, like when, through microworlds, microprotocols and pro-
grams. _how_ is a also a collectivity, based on heuristics, prompt-line
and other commands, pathways through wires and atmospheres.

_why_ is dependent in the first place, on first places, causes and ef-
fects, interrogatives and answers fulfilling the gap left by the uplift
of the question. _why_ works autonomically in the small, loses its
reason in the large.

how, what, why, when, where, who, lose their _face_ among the implicate
order of the networked worldings. with the loss of the _face,_ language
adjusts poorly to the real, physical, virtual, problematic, alter.

think of the autonomic world or anorectic world, the symbolic cast as
centrifugal residue against intermachinations of kernels, world into
worlds, ontological identities transformed into epistemological equival-
ences.

think of intranet [ net [ internet, the series without beginning or end-
ing at either end of these spectral disturbances. think of organization
or articulation traveling the wires, mutually-adjusting protocols or
agents. think of multiply-connected riemannian spheres.


(as a concrete example - look at the _emission_ in relation to what has
been traditionally a classical _election_ or _voting procedure_ in the
united states - as if there were a clean and proper resolution at the
end of what is, increasingly, a _mess._)

This week and next week at the Poetry Project:


TONIGHT, Wednesday, November 8th at 8 pm
GRACE PALEY AND BRENDA COULTAS
One of America's best-loved writers, Grace Paley was the first-ever officia=
l
New York State Writer, named by Mario Cuomo in 1989. She is the author of
three collections of short fiction and three collections of poetry. Ms.
Paley has also been active for various social causes, from protests against
the Vietnam War to demonstrations against the production of nuclear weapons=
.
At the Poetry Project, Ms. Paley will read from Begin Again (Farrar, Straus
& Giroux), a collection of new and previously published poems, which are
described by poet Adrienne Rich as "exuberant, heartbreaking, committed."
Brenda Coultas, a former student of Anne Waldman and Allen Ginsberg, is the
author of Boy Eye (Art Institute of Maryland, 2000), A Summer Newsreel
(Second Story Press, 1999), and Early Films (Rodent Press, 1996). Her work
has appeared in American Poetry Review, Fence, Epoch, The Hat, and other
journals. Originally from Southern Indiana, she has lived in New York City
since 1995.=20


Friday, November 10th at 10:30 pm
THE HOUSE OF PERNOD
In the collage tradition of the '90's, The House of Pernod is a hybrid of
funk, chaos, poetry, theater, and rock & roll. The band delivers "a unique
and intoxicating energy," says Larry McDonald of Gil Scott Heron's Amnesia
Express. Joining them tonight is Detroit poet M.L. Liebler, D. Nurkse, Sean
Thomas Dougherty, the editor of the Red Brick Review, and Noel Jones.


Monday, November 13th at 8 pm
ELIZABETH YOUNG AND LAUREN GUDATH
Talented, up-and-coming poet Elizabeth Young is the Assistant Editor for Th=
e
Poetry Project Newsletter and co-host for the Belladonna reading series.
Moving with grace from prose to verse, her work is an exploration of a new
landscape, one not confined to previous notions of surrealism and realism.
Her poems have appeared in Tool a Magazine, Skanky Possum, and on the Poetr=
y
Project=B9s web site. Lauren Gudath works for a dot-com company in San
Francisco. Full of humor and fantasy, her poetry resides in the world of po=
p
culture, present and future. Ms. Gudath is currently working on a series of
poems about places in California she has never visited. Her most recent
chapbook, The Television Documentary, was published in 1999 by Second Story
Press. This Kind of Interpretation Brings Luck, a collaboration with visual
artist David Larsen, is forthcoming from Lucinda Press.


Wednesday, November 15th at 8 pm
THE SONNETS READING
Poet, rock musician, and The Basketball Diaries author Jim Carroll will be
among the poets celebrating the republication of the late Ted Berrigan's
essential early work, The Sonnets, which will be read in its entirety. Also
among the readers will be John Ashbery, America=B9s foremost contemporary
poet; Ed Sanders, poet, founding member of the musical group The Fugs, and
author of The Family, the best-selling account of the Manson family murders=
;
poet Alice Notley, who was married to Berrigan at the time of his death and
who wrote the introduction to the new edition; and poet Ron Padgett, a
friend with whom Berrigan wrote many collaborative works.
"The Sonnets are an enduring benchmark in mid-20th century American
poetics," says poet Robert Creeley. Originally published in 1964, The
Sonnets is considered by many to be Ted Berrigan=B9s most important and
influential book. Reflecting the new American sensibilities of the 1960s as
well as timeless poetic themes, The Sonnets are both eclectic and classical=
.
Ted Berrigan was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1934 to working-class
parents. He established his reputation in the 1960s as a poet, art critic,
teacher, and publisher. He published more than 20 books during his lifetime=
.
He died on July 4, 1983.


Friday, November 17th at 10:30 pm
WORD OF MOUTH: AN ANTHOLOGY OF GAY AMERICAN POETRY
Contributors Edward Field, Wayne Koestenbaum, Jaime Manrique, Taylor Mead,
David Trinidad, Mark Wunderlich, and editor Timothy Liu will read from this
ground-breaking anthology, which offers a sweeping introduction to Gay
American poetry of the past half-century. "Of course there are poems who
overtly flaunt their sexuality ... but there are so many quieter poems (and
poets) who  might elude the most finely tuned gaydar." =ADfrom the preface by
Timothy Liu.

Amen, enough of narrowminded voters who are deluded and fairly uninformed.
Can Al Gore tell me what exactly "Clean Coal" is and exactly why we should
tear down mountains in West Virginia (where people live) and not touch
Alaska (where people also live)?  Did you know that coal burning plants put
five times the amount of radioactivity into the air as compared with nuclear
plants?  Clean coal.  Good one, Al.

New from Pavement Saw Press:

Richard Blevins
Fogbow Bridge: Selected Poems (1972-1999)
Forward by Stephen Ellis
ISBN: ISBN 1-886350-92-2    Softcover Trade $12
ISBN: ISBN 1-886350-93-0    Hardcover Library Edition on Acid Free paper

128 pages

This collection of poetry by Richard Blevins is his second book of
poems. He is the current editor of Charles Olson and Robert Creeley:
The Complete Correspondence (Black Sparrow)

Most of the poems in this book were selected from
Court of the Half-King (Tansy, 1980)
Remembering The Future (Zelot, 1981)
Taz Alago (Zelot/Tansy, 1984)
Letters from Kansas (Zelot, 1986)
Clarel’s Motel (Am Here, 1987)
Three Sleeps: A Historomance (Igneus, 1992)
Longplaying (1994)
High Season (Oasii, 1995)
and The Collected Later Poems of Philip Marlowe (Talisman House, 1998).


"I like the way Blevin’s wiggles his lines for eye and ear."
         —James Laughlin


“Blevins is the true inheritor of Olson's Bibliography for Ed Dorn.”
—George F. Butterick


“Travelling hard in the dark of poems, hard music a traveller needs to
keep the aggressions of place at bay — Blevins keeps readers musing,
making us guess where the road runs over the bleak prairie and where it
turns into a line of some poem his mind is stored with, line of highway
and line of verse stretching out, superimposed, into the distance that
draws him.  Draws us.  “Using the Cantos,” using Olson, the way you
borrow from a friend a good car to test the desert with, to go with out
into the interesting danger.  Blevins has indeed made, as he says, a
career of the travel poem — but not a poem about travelling (no one is
on the road except the road), but a poem we have to travel.  This
collection is rich with instances of venture we share with him, poems
that know how to read the world as well as to talk/sing about it.  And
there’s one grand long text here,  “Clarel’s Motel” — an exemplum of
method and music at once, and how they serve to keep intelligence on
track, flourish a clean wit we can do with these days.”

—Robert Kelly



“What has happened to America
has happened to all of us,
Richard Blevins reminds us,
singing his uncanny and intricate music.
From inside the vast loneliness and plaintive landscapes
of our native country, Blevins’ beset reports, testimonies,
curses, and meditations send word home.  This poet—
meticulous scout and bereft wanderer—
elegizes and celebrates our nation’s hero-ghosts
and hallucinatory sages, and,
above all, our thirst for a vivid
and human, yet elusive communal design.
This Selected marks both an earned arrival and a tantalizing passage.”

—Judith Vollmer



“Whether at Kent State with Duncan,
Paris with Cendrars,
Italy with Pound’s grave lizard, or
on the Plains with Chief Joseph, Blevins
is constantly keeping both, the footnotes
of Romance and the Midwestern Crane-like roots
of the American voice and lament, ongoing.”

—Peter Kidd


“Enviable style. And lots of things —
a wonderful sense of the material that makes poems...
Gives me hope that somebody's out there doing something well—
very little evidence of it, otherwise.”

—Guy Davenport


“Although this art doesn’t resemble Robert Duncan’s, the quick
psychological discrimination and scatter, and the means of laying out
such extensive phenomena derive from the late master’s technology.  The
work becomes a luminated graph of sentience across space, a body of
prior observations, pulled to focus in the present case. ‘Our poets make
much out of what seems worse than nothing.’ That’s a really legitimate
estimation, whichever way you take it.  And out of it comes a
historomantic resolution so complex only poetry would even attempt it.”

—Edward Dorn


 “...what a richness (pardon) of the more than a quarter century's work,
so diverse and so reaching, winding and reassembling and finding,
reascending and returning, plumbing...in such encompassing share!” —Ken
Irby


This is one of two Blevins’ books still in print out of his thirteen
titles, and the only book published in a substantial press run. This
Selected will undoubtedly open up some new bearings for the field of
historiographic poetry, its vital contribution to American poetry.


Fogbow Bridge is Richard Blevins' second book of poems; Three Sleeps:  A
Historomance was published in 1991 by Igneus Press.  He is the author of
13 chapbooks of poems, most recently The Collected Later Poems of Philip
Marlowe (Jensen/Daniels, 1999).  He holds degrees from Kent State
University (BGS, 1973), where he studied with Robert Duncan and Ed Dorn,
the University of Oregon (MA, 1976), and the University of Pittsburgh
(PhD, 1985), where he wrote a dissertation on the literature of the
American West.  He has taught at the Greensburg Campus of the University
of Pittsburgh since 1978, and also at the University of Akron and Kent
State.  In 1999, he was awarded a Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching
Award by the University of Pittsburgh.

He is the editor of two volumes of Charles Olson and Robert Creeley:
The Complete Correspondence (Black Sparrow) and of George F. Butterick's
Collected Later Poems (SUNY-Buffalo, 1989).  He has published over a
dozen encyclopedia articles, including entries in the Dictionary of
Literary Biography, the Encyclopedia of World Literature, and the Pound
Encyclopedia.  During the 1980s, he was editor and co-publisher of Zelot
Press, which printed some 70 titles.  His literary archive is housed at
Kent State University Special Collections Library.

I thought this was appropriate post-election poesy:


  CODA

  A strong song tows
  us, long earsick.
  Blind, we follow
  rain slant, spray flick
  to fields we do not know.

  Night, float us.
  Offshore wind, shout,
  ask the sea
  what's lost, what's left,
  what horn sunk,
  what crown adrift.

  Where we are who knows
  of kings who sup
  while day fails? Who,
  swinging his axe
  to fell kings, guesses
  where we go?



  [Basil Bunting, 1965]

Hi,
I'm very interested in this project.  I'm a published poet (and writer)
working on a novel now (set in New Orleans); I find that when I'm stuck, I
go in the kitchen and cook; if I'm feeling very good about my work on a
particular day, I bake.
Please send me the guidelines.
Thanks,

Al. (Is it?) I think you mean that coal plants put more carbon dioxide into
the air, which some scientists maintain is harmful.(Because of global
warming which is a pretty nebulous theory and open to debate as to whether
its actually a problem or is occurring). But for engineers its probably
easier to design a safe coal plant than a nuclear plant.(Which when they
melt down, as one or two will on average about every 150 years for sure, has
terrible effects in case anyone forgets Chernobyl or 3 Mile Island). The
best bet ultimately is more research into the efficiency of electric
generators (which are motors in reverse). An enormous amount of potential
energy is wasted or lost in electric motors/generators which could
(theoretically) push large trucks along. Diesel-electric trains still use a
significant amount of oil (via diesel (and oil)  - which is fundamentally
the same as coal. But electric cars etc say and utilising solar energy (with
very advanced generator systems) would mean less polution etc (and noise).
 But it looks as tho its all rather acco now. If I was American I'd probably
vote for Gore. When I think of Bush I think: CIA! Anyway, its all very
controversial now. People go on hoping that one pathetic vote every
(3years?) is going to change things, and I include myself. But then the
Politicos turn out to be bullshit artists. So very little changes.
  All that aside, I hope things are going well for everyone, Richard. P.S.
Where's me mate Bill Austin these days? Being an acco he's probably off on a
sabbatical.

Hi, Can someone please tell me the origin of the expression, "I can beat any
man from any land, at any game that he can name, for any amount that he can
count." It was used in the film Walk Softly, Stranger.  Thanks.

ATTENTION!!  We have finally discovered the reason for the national decline
in college enrollment.  It seems that all recent applications contain the
following choices:  1)matriculated, 2) non-matriculated, 3) Buchanan.  The
arrows, of course, are all pointing at one another.  An investigation is in
progress.  Best, Bill

No. Not coal. I meant radioactivity.  Uranium, in other words.  They extract
it from coal, you know.  But this isn't about poetics, so this is the last
post on this subject for me.

Al. (Is it?) I think you mean that coal plants put more carbon dioxide into
the air, which some scientists maintain is harmful.(Because of global
warming which is a pretty nebulous theory and open to debate as to whether
its actually a problem or is occurring). But for engineers its probably
easier to design a safe coal plant than a nuclear plant.(Which when they
melt down, as one or two will on average about every 150 years for sure, has
terrible effects in case anyone forgets Chernobyl or 3 Mile Island). The
best bet ultimately is more research into the efficiency of electric
generators (which are motors in reverse). An enormous amount of potential
energy is wasted or lost in electric motors/generators which could
(theoretically) push large trucks along. Diesel-electric trains still use a
significant amount of oil (via diesel (and oil)  - which is fundamentally
the same as coal. But electric cars etc say and utilising solar energy (with
very advanced generator systems) would mean less polution etc (and noise).
 But it looks as tho its all rather acco now. If I was American I'd probably
vote for Gore. When I think of Bush I think: CIA! Anyway, its all very
controversial now. People go on hoping that one pathetic vote every
(3years?) is going to change things, and I include myself. But then the
Politicos turn out to be bullshit artists. So very little changes.
  All that aside, I hope things are going well for everyone, Richard. P.S.
Where's me mate Bill Austin these days? Being an acco he's probably off on a
sabbatical.

email communication has pitfalls that i sometimes forget in my eagerness to
press keys - my response was not directed to 'proximate' and it's playful
potential for interaction, but intended to bring up the general issue of
quality of poetry, language, design, etc., as opposed to innovation which is
too often seen as desirable today, as in the wired mtv cyber beat rebel art

Just got issue #6 of _Quid_; I'd briefly reported on issue #5 in this forum
before & thought I'd do the same again.  As always: an unpretentious stapled
sheaf of paper emanating from the UK, which grabs the attention more than
many more polished (& pricy) productions (the magazine costs, true to its
name, one pound).  The prose here includes JH Prynne's dissection of
Handke's dictum that "the first victim of war is language" ("We live, as
always we have, in an historic glasshouse of language; we can see out but
only through the glass and it is not easy to cast a well-aimed stone that
will not smash up more than was intended."; "Human language...is not some
innocent civilian victim too defenceless not to fall at the first waves of
warlike assault somewhere within the system, when the handy concordat of
moral reason starts to shatter; it sits at the tables where war is planned
and social consciousness manipulated and it services the justification of
war aims and the rescheduled debt provisions of just, patriotic, necessary
and humanitarian terms of engagement.  Not one word of any langauge ever
known to man has ever been innocent of these things; just as no human body
has ever submitted to be expressively at the complete disposal of the mind
that inhabits it or the meanings which that mind claims to deploy.").
There's also two letters concerning "totality" & contemporary poetry by
Peter Riley (these had their origins in an exchange on the British-Poets
listserv from several months ago) & Drew Milne's review of the early
writings of Althusser.  Sprouting from the crevices between these offerings
are poems by Tom Jones, Jennifer Moxley, Tim Morris, Ben Friedlander &
Keston Sutherland--the latter, "Thursday and Forever", is a poem written in
response to the fall of Milosevic.

I thought I'd also enclose a review by Pete Smith I published in _The Gig_
#6, of Keston Sutherland's most recent volume, _[Bar Zero]_.  Both _[Bar
Zero]_ & _Quid_ are obtainable from Keston (email: kms20@hermes.cam.ac.uk --
web: www.barquepress.com).  It's an enterprise worth supporting, I think, as
one of the few active little magazines in the UK worth following, & one of
the more enterprising of the small presses.

On! On! Incomprehensibility

Keston Sutherland, Bar Zero.  Cambridge: Barque Press (c/o Keston Sutherland
& Andrea Brady, Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge CB2 1TA, UK; web:
<http://www.barquepress.com>), 2000.  30pp.  £3.  1-903488-09-5.

In the early '60s Dr Who, in his William Hartnell incarnation, confided to
me in a pre-mail that even the old Tardis had more zip "when young Keston
will be on board."  Destination: mid-C18th England & Germany; mission: to
trace Romanticism through a late-modernist/post-punk sensibility by means of
the cipher zero.  That is not all _Bar Zero_ is, but it's a way
in--signposted by the epigraph from Schlegel, the nod to P. Bysshe in
"Remark to The West Wind," and other Odes otherwise encoded.

My Langenscheidt & instincts render the Schlegel as: "Many tender spirits
are needed / around the fire to feed its blaze."  If "spirit" contains
"ghost," this sentence gains poignancy with knowledge that the poem "Zeroes
Galore" was written for and, in _Quid_ 4, dedicated to Douglas Oliver
(before his untimely death, to honour his intelligent tenderness and his
fearlessness in the face of all levels of tyrannic behaviour).  I see that
poem framed in the opening & closing stanzas by echoes of Prynne & Ted
Berrigan respectively--

The zeroes count, much more than you think
you don't think and say fuck it.
        (cf. close of _Down where changed_)

one death for everyone, finally you
might end, and our requiems then starts reversible and
lovely and the hope won't also end, I never shall.
        (cf. "Red Shift")

--which is nicely appropriate since Oliver held these two writers in high
regard (Oliver in "Trink" calls Berrigan "my stout heart").

While _Bar Zero_ is not as stylistically cohesive as earlier works like
_Mincemeat Seesaw_ or _At the Motel Partial Opportunity_ the themes
announced in title & epigraph thread the poems.  Zero as hero (surely
another fire-tending spirit in MacSweeney?  "Bar" he was in _Pearl_ & "Zero
Hero" in a _Demons_ extract: the intensity of language in political
critique, too, is at a similar pitch); as a nobody, then; as that concept
without which mathematics would have been paddling in the doldrums--no
multiplication, no algebra, no calculus; as the rear sights on a gun and the
verb fired from that barrel, "to zero in," lately familiar from the TV war
of the Gulf (cultural event sponsored by Shell etc); the nadir.   Bar--to
exclude, forbid; as noun, impediment to progress; a plea that destroys a
case in law; a system of courts.  "Bar-code," to bring these themes into the
world of commerce.  Fires abound and their effects & opposites: blazes &
ice; revolutionary fires whose shadows flatten, contort & distort your
personal stand; and the verb--to lay off workers, to take deadly aim.  Hope,
justice and tenderness in several guises also appear.  This, then, is
ethically driving and driven work; but also work at great play, hence worth
rereading.

The verse is mostly taut, some contained in quatrains, some shaped like
Horatian odes: pattern seems to interest Sutherland, as a means, one
suspects, of unleashing power, improving aim.  Sentences trawl across pages,
especially in "A Pow Ode" and "The Code for Ice," and, as "disordered /
asyndeton blowing over" ("Remark to The West Wind") hints, conjunctions are
mostly skipped.  As well as the key words found throughout the book,
Sutherland threads certain words through individual poems: e.g., "riot"
occurs in each stanza of "Refuted Eros," and similarly "beneficent" in "To
the Last Ansaphone," "zero/es" in "Zeroes Galore."  There is a fit between
Schlegel's remarks on Romantic poetry in his 116th Atheneum Fragment and
some effects achieved by Sutherland's verse.  "Romantic poetry is a
progressive, universal poetry....  It alone can become...a mirror of the
whole circumambient world, an image of the age....  [I]ts real essence: that
it should forever be becoming and never be perfected"--these phrases seem
apt for Sutherland's ambitions.  Schlegel's essay "On Incomprehensibility"
also seems pertinent for some of the pamphlet's preoccupations.  It gives us
the epigraph, but also some maxims and mischiefs the poet plays with in
behind-the-scenes ideas or, in specific glances, in the poems: "Why should I
provide misunderstandings when no one wants to take them up?"; "A classical
text must never be entirely comprehensible"; "Irony is the form of paradox";
"We haven't gotten far enough in giving offense"; "What gods will rescue us
from all these ironies?  The only solution is to find an irony that might be
able to swallow up all these big and little ironies and leave no trace of
them at all....  But even this would only be a short-term solution.  I fear
that...soon there will arise a new generation of little ironies: for truly
the stars augur the fantastic."  Space as run down now as time: suffice to
note a little of how paradox works in "The Code for Ice": "free is itself a
code"; "reek of freedom outcodes / basic ice"; "freedom is not the code."

There is care at the level of prosody which may be missed in the general
speed of much of this work.   Desire to go beyond the joining-the-dots
technique of much verse is stated blatantly: following two similes, the
first fitting to a theme, the second arresting in its ludicrousness--"things
are hotting / up like the fuse in a fridge plug; / the heart gripped like
spam by batter"--we read:

likeness was a trick we clapped for
                   eye snare, spoon
fed freestyle  (21)

Having & eating the cake: more then than pablum.  Commas also do more work
than usual in some poems (e.g. "get the / hell out I once, more say, say
what / ever you feel can..."); by these feints of punctuation in the
pamphlet's last sentence--

                    across the celestial equator,
    Venus breaks, the resolve and
you are bound, to recast down a faultless star  (30)

--you, reader/listener, are bound up in your resolve while chance and the
world (evening star) go merrily on around you.  Earlier in this poem,
"Atonement," fire asks "can you go on?" in the face of collective memory of
trauma:

                            Shines in the mind
crispy, a shiver of faces throws
            upon you shadow, bright urban lattice
adrift among glances like drapery, can you go
                        on fire says.  There is no adequate
remorse or adequate reason why
            there is none.

For this reader that last sentence fills the awful gap in "Remark to The
West Wind" between the last word of the second stanza and first of the
third--

          camp

concentration touching your
invisible acumen

_Bar Zero_, where everything but nothing is allowed.  The poet has threaded
silk through his three-piece suit, but the fly is still undone.

<< is innovation still desirable?  what about quality?

tom bell

I, for one, have always appreciated innovation in any and all disciplines.
But I would appreciate some feedback on the following.  Is what is generally
considered innovative poetry by most list members still innovative?  The last
four decades have given us a truckload of formalist experiments, all of which
have sources in poetry ancient, or at least not so modern.  That's fine and
no doubt unavoidable.  After all, only nothing is made out of nothing.  But
does this emphasis on formal/visual elements "blind" us to other ways of
being innovative?  I've encountered list members who have all but dismissed
Frank O'Hara, for example, as less than innovative, merely because his
experimental impulse was more focused on tone (attitude?) and subject matter.
 On the other hand, it's probably true that we all labor under certain
prejudices.  Maybe list members might speculate on what is coming next.
Where do we go from here?  Are most younger artists genuinely innovative, or
just joiners?  How long do we continue on the same road, wherever it's
located--whatever it's "movement," before we risk looking geriatric?  As for
quality, how equipped is anyone to judge it beyond obvious grammatical errors
and internal contradictions?  Most, if not all, qualifying judgments of art
have always been colored by subjective tastes and assumptions.  Aristotle, as
one example, would probably have dismissed much contemporary art for failing
to follow the rules--his rules.  Anyway, the most interesting discussions can
issue from interrogations that can never be responded to in absolute terms.
Best, Bill

                            The Dilemma of A Street

   She watched. In her dilemma of a street, she watched.  "That man", =
she conclued, "shall never wear a suit. Such a free man, so swish, =
so...so..."I am me" "  She thought.
  But (and or) the blue edges of eternity's sky unrolled. "Who cares?" =
it seemed to say, as in a dream there are beings that always in  blazing =
gold and vermilion snaking skeins do seem to seem. Away. (Pieces are =
being moved as Great Preparations proceed.)
  And dust gathers expectant as movements outward in expansive guesture =
prove quite otherwise the hopeful and logical lights.
  Cars and men do endless pass.
 "If I could lean forth and smile and nod and slightly lean and touch my =
hand on or above his knee would he be mine or he be me?" That is, if, =
say, we sat beside each other one hour in a pub?
 But a chuckle comes from a far quark of bitter men from a cynic dark: =
for all are words and whirling webs where something sucks in geney joy.
 And yet - I believe (at least) this hedge before me, its light.
 Cars and things to endless pass in this espace.
 And we traverse various rivers of forgetting us until so many =
assembled, died in old dreams, or did disappear.  And (quite forcefully =
now), torrents of red are aquirted from mortal living tubes; as cars do =
pass, and strange and Goyic figures do contorted dance and dance.
  They dance and laugh and pass, as indifferent magic music plays.=20

Synopticon | Louis Armand and John Kinsella


Authors' Note

This sequence was composed during the course of an e-mail correspondence
and remains an on-going project. Each piece is the outcome of numerous
promptings and erasures, sorties, advances, feints, overwritings and
defacements, pastiches and parodies, rendering a "synoptical" text whose
authorship is ultimately anonymous (--in this sense "John Kinsella" and
"Louis Armand" function merely as ciphers).


About the Authors

Louis Armand is an Australian writer and artist currently living in
Prague, where he lectures at Charles University. His work has appeared in
various journals, including Poetry Revue, Sulfur, Meanjin and Heat. His
most recent publication is Erosions (Sydney: Vagabond Press, 1999). A
collection of Poetry, Inexorable Weather, and volume of experimental
prose, The Garden, are forthcoming in 2000 from Arc and Salt respectively
(both in the UK). He is poetry editor of The Prague Revue, and editor of
the literary broadsheet Plastic (Semtext).

John Kinsella was born in Western Australia in 1963 and is the author of
twenty books, most recently: Poems 1980-1994 (Bloodaxe, 1998); The Hunt
(Bloodaxe, 1998), a Poetry Book Society Recommendation; Visitants
(Bloodaxe, 1999); a novel, Genre (FACP, 1997); a volume of short fiction,
Grappling Eros (FACP, 1998); and an anthology of contemporary Australian
poetry, Landbridge (Arc, 2000). He is the editor of the international
literary journal Salt, co-editor of the British literary journal Stand,
and International Editor of the American journal The Kenyon Review. He is
currently a member of the Nobel Museum Literary Committee in Stokholm.


Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Here it is -- the November update for New York State's Literary
Organizations, Events, Curators, and Writers, brought to you by
Bright Hill Press, in partnership with the New York State Council
on the Arts.  Each month the site adds new organizations,
curators, and writers -- if your literary organization is not included; if
you're a writer with a book and you're not listed; if you're a literary
curator, and your events are not included; if you're an independent
literary publisher of books or periodic journals and you're not part of
the Poulin Project pages on the site, email us at
wordthur@catskill.net, and we'll tell you how to be listed.   (It's
easiest for us to include your information if you cut and paste your
information into the email.)

Questions?  Comments?  We'd love to hear from you.

I wanted to thank you all for your very helpful suggestions re: body
memoirs.  They will greatly help me expand my range of reading
options.  I don't need all that many selections, no more than a
dozen, as this is mostly a writing workshop.  Rather focus closer on
a few things, as opposed to the craft classes where we read like
crazy.

Anyway, thinking about all of this and looking through works that
have meant a lot to me that deal with the body, and having this
limitation of the class focusing on "nonfiction," I'm struck by how
much of the most interesting writing on the body is labeled as
fiction, even in many current books, such as Michelle Tea's Valencia
or Rebecca Brown's The Gift of the Body, in which I suspect the only
thing fictional is the punctuation.  So, I'm wondering why so much
current writing that deals with the body that is clearly
personal-experienced based is labeled as fiction--particularly since,
given the publishing climate, nonfiction is rumored to be easier to
get published--and look at the amount of novelization that clearly
goes on in popular memoirs, such as The Liar's Club.  In Eileen
Myles' new book, not only is Eileen a character, but her entire
family is, and it's still labeled fiction.  This can also often be
said it be true of my own work.  Or taking it to poetry, works like
Harryette Mullen's Trimmings--is this representing the poeticized
body rather than the nonfiction body?  I am planning to ask these
people about this issue, but I was wondering if anybody here has any
thoughts on this.

And then, there's the broader issue--how can one have a nonfiction
body as opposed to a fictionalized body when the body itself is so
resistant to language.  This seems to be one place where those
foolish genre divisions immediately collapse.  And, of course, if we
look at people like Judith Butler, we could, perhaps, extend gender
deconstruction and say that The Body is a fiction.

Thanks again.

=only if you believe you have to be published to be a poet,
in that case, does only the written printed word have value?
what about all the other poetries, spoken, viewed and on the
web(cyberpoetries)?

but, i agree, published poets are becoming redundant, so is published poetry.
i believe it is because published poetry has become predictable in form and
content and quite frankly, boring. haiku, limerick, sonnet, bush ballad,
freestyle, all forms almost tell you what they are by the way they look on
a page, even before you read. the of-the-moment poetic experience is
diminished when the text is fixed and printed in a book. try it, pick up
any poetry anthology and try and predict the kind of poem by its shape on
the page. poetry is not being read as a recreational activity any longer,
but read for scholastic purposes.
but people are still experiencing poetry, people still attend
readings/soundings, there is a huge amount of activity on the web with
various forms of animated text, interactive texts and random text
generators, not to mention all the collaborative projects happening across
networks. performance poetry or spoken word poetry may bring the
unpredictability to the poetry experience, not seeing the words written
until they are spoken, which has kept this area of poetry interesting. it
may also bring authorial presence to the experience, to enliven the
experience, and certainly fulfills a role as entertainment. at the live
reading often a combination of things come together to make unique of-
the-moment poetic experiences, a poets words, the way they said them at the
time, how the listener was feeling, the sound of the coffee machine, the
environment of the room, the occassion for the sounding, the context of the
sounding.

this of the-moment experience of words is no more evident than in
cyberspace, and it is the performative qualities or devices that we now
attach to words by way of software that makes poetry in this medium
interesting to me today. poetry is performing itself, even creating itself,
without the presence of the poet to perform it. and i don't just mean
digitised recordings of poets performing, i mean poems in which the device
of motion can be added to a word to combine with and make new meaning. i
mean poems which receive text input from the reader/user and from the
author, and from a random text generation software, and combine the texts
to create a new text. i mean poetry that responds to user input, allows
alternate navigations of the text, image, sound and animation.

but maybe you meant "i am" is the redundancy

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless... >> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

transcultural projects and sources.

occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet

copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Friends:

Pleased to notice that Brenda Hillman's essay "Crossing The Garden: Rae
Armantrout's Metaphysics" appears in the current issue of How2.  This essay
originally appeared in "A Wild Salience: The Writing of Rae Armantrout",
published by Burning Press earlier this year.

There's another complete essay from the book available from the book's
webpage, http://www.burningpress.org/armantrout: Hank Lazer's "Lyricism of
the Swerve" (in PDF format).

We still have a few copies of the book available for sale; it includes
additional essays by Lyn Hejinian, Laura Moriarty, Aldon L. Nielsen, Rachel
Blau DuPlessis, Fanny, Ann, Susan Wheeler, Lydia Davis, Jessica Grim, Kit
Robinson, Robert Creeley, Bobbie West, Tom Beckett, David Bromige, Charles
Alexander, Bob Perelman, and Ron Silliman.  Plus poems by Rae and her
friends.

This is a rare opportunity to support independent publishers producing
book-length studies of writers who are still alive.  Books make great
gifts...

Complete ordering information is available on the website, but the short
version is: $15 to Burning Press, PO Box 585, Cleveland OH 44107.


Thanks for your support,

There is a LOT of innovative work out there - look at the material on the
Webartery list or 7-11 - Integer (NN), Mez, I'd put my own work there,
some of what jodi has done etc. There's a discussion on Webartery about
this at the moment. Look at Talan Memmott's work - or that of Jim Andrews
or Steve Duffy or Brian Lennon, Mez, Jim Andrews, Tom Bell, Reiner
Strasser, etc. etc.

As long as one keeps within the boundaries of traditional avant-garde
poetics and poetry, formalist or not formalist, one will have these dis-
cussions and disagreements, etc. As soon as one steps out and looks around
(for example the poems written in Perl language in, I think, Programming
Perl as another example), there are all sorts of amazing things going
on. And I might add not necessarily by "younger" writers - this again can
easily descend into ageism.

Look at work which is dynamic or with active open hyperlinks or Java or
Javscript work or work which floods through the wires or takes over your
computer or adds sound and movement or uses characters under continuous
transformation or uses Flash or simply uses coding and programming as
catalysis or is written through all sorts of new means of collaboration or
uses MOOs or MUDs or various chatforms as a way of generating or perform-
ing text or even uses routers and routings, writings tranversing the
planet in split second or writings which portend expanded bandwidth and
body to come - the pinging of Stelarc's body etc. etc. a few years ago.

Even if one is only talking about lower ascii on the page, there is still
the work of Mez and NN - incredibly innovative!

Why is all of this not CENTRAL to a discussion of Poetics? Ah well!

Innovation is everywhere online; it can be very very close to a
renaissance!

Now HERE'S a real opportunity. I hope Mr. Louis' e-mail is flooded with
eager applicants for this job. Just out of curiosity, how much is the IT
Manager for Silicon Capital Limited willing to PAY for the privilege of
having a real Poetics List member write him a real poem about "the spring
season"? And will his daughter use said poem as her own, "sampling," as it
were, the contents? Would the poet be offered round-trip air fare to counsel
the daughter for the contest?

I'd been pretty discouraged about the level of discourse on the List lately,
but this opens all sorts of new panoramas.

John. I see now. I was talking to someone in a technical field  and realised
that the by products could in fact include more concentrated isotopes. It
looks as tho neither coal-fired or nuclear are very healthy. So I see your
point. But, to switch a bit, I think its a good thing if "poetics" slides
off into politics and thus into scientific or technical areas. I enjoy
studying literature and poetry as on there own so to speak, but at a certain
point a certain amount of technical or scientific knowledge helps, even if
one is only an "intelligent amateur". Similarly technical or business
college people might benefit from some lit. etc Sometimes I wished I'd had
the the old British style education as I'd like to have been "versed" in the
major classics,have read Greek and other languages, etc But one notices the
distortions that arise with writers like Pound who have little scientific
knowledge, or Eliot - however that (knowledge) (conversly) doesnt stop
scientists from coming to ridiculous conclusions. But Its a pity somehow the
way we separate everything into "that's poetics" or "that's philosophy"  or
"science" or "that's politics". Maybe for time and convenience sake that's
the way it has to be, most times. How clear are the divisions? Regards,
Richard.

SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC PRESENTS

ROB FITTERMAN & SIANNE NGAI
Friday, November 17, 2000, at 8 p.m.

An exciting return. People think of ROB FITTERMAN as some kind of new
generation "Language" poet, but he might just be the ultimate heir to the
great Objectivists instead, for his epic "Metropolis" project marries the
music, scope, and power of Louis Zukofsky to the
historico-narrative-documentary sweep of Charles Reznikoff. And he's a lot
funnier than anything on TV on Friday nights, so come on down!
Metropolis Book 1 (1-15) is forthcoming from Sun & Moon Press. Metropolis
16-20 was published by Edge Books, and Metropolis 1-3 by Meow Press. He is
also the author of five other books including several collaborations with
visual and music artists. He is the editor-publisher of OBJECT journal and P
O E T S C O O P, and he lives in New York.

SIANNE NGAI's writing piles on layers and layers of contingency and irony,
then scrapes them away with a nailfile or cuticle stick till only raw matter
remains, a harsh puddle of the real thing. She's what they used to call
"painterly." A recent transplant from New York to San Francisco, Ngai is the
author of
Criteria (O Books), and, with Brian Kim Stefans, The Cosmopolitans
(Interlope). Ngai's recent projects include an exchange with poet/filmmaker
Abigail Child published in the Philly Talks Newsletter; as co-author with
Nancy Shaw, a catalogue essay on Stan Douglas (for the exhibition "Double
Vision: Stan Douglas and Douglas Gordon") published by the Dia Center for
the Arts; and a
new critical essay titled, "Jealous Schoolgirls, Single White Females, and
Other Bad Examples: Rethinking Gender and 'Envy'" forthcoming in a future
issue of Camera Obscura.


Timken Lecture Hall
CCAC
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco
(just off the intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

More info:
415-551-9278
http://www.sptraffic.org

SPT is now located at the San Francisco campus of the California College of
Arts & Crafts. Take the 22 or 19 bus lines, or drive -- from within the city
-- down 16th toward the bay, turn left on Wisconsin, and you'll see the big
CCAC structure! From the Bay Bridge, take the 9th St/Civic Center offramp,
go Left from the offramp onto 8th, Left on Brannan, Right on 7th, Left on
Irwin, take Irwin up to 8th and you're there. If athletic, you can also take
BART to Civic Center and ride the bike lane down 8th to Irwin. CCAC is at
the corner of 8th & Irwin; evening parking is GOOD by San Francisco
standards or lack thereof.

There are bars and restaurants in that area for debriefing before or
afterwards. Ask Elizabeth at the event.

DIRECTIONS TO SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC'S NEW LOCALE

OOPS,

IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE *EAST* BAY, PLEASE NOTE:

from the bridge, take the 9th St/Civic Center offramp, go LEFT from the
offramp onto 8th, LEFT on Brannan, RIGHT on 7th, then RIGHT (not left as I
miswrote a minute ago!) on Irwin. Take Irwin 2 blocks up to 8th and you are
there.

HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!

This Friday, Nov. 17 for a reading by Sianne Ngai and Rob Fitterman!

If we are talking about the past that would be "have lived," and who

Yeah, I should renege on that notion. I mean, I'm an unpublished

Outlet (7) Survey

>> 1. Who is your favorite obscure(d) female author

Clarice Lispector.  Her I/eye amazes, her writing the feminine into Joyce's
Portrait of an Artist, the humor and drama of her fragmented Cronicas, the
cinema of her Family Portrait.  I love her in hopes of better translations
or of Portuguese-by-Osmosis (PBO), to love her better, more closely.

Ursa Corregidora (Corregidora)
Gail (Heroine, My Paris)
Karintha (Cane)
Pilate (Song of Solomon)

2a.  Name your 3 favorite female literary friendships.
Sula & Nell (Sula)
Tituba & Hester Prynne (I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem)
Shug & Celie (The Color Purple)
all the Judy Blume girls

I am trying to find out who wrote this poem.   My father sent it to my
mother during WWII.

Thank you for any help.
________

It seems to me that God above created you for me to love, he picked you
out
of all the rest because he knew I loved you best.
   I once had a heart  so brave and true, but now it's gone from me to
you.
take care of it as I would have done for you have two and I have none.
   If I get to Heaven , and you're not there,  I'll paint your name on a

golden stair, so all the world will know and see, just how much you mean
to
me.

i don't know how old yr daughter is, but one of my all-time favorite
spring poems is the one by edna st. vincent millay that begins, "To what
purpose, April, do you return again?" and ends, "not only underground are
the brains of men eaten by maggots"--no, that's not the last line, but
it's in there.  anyway, is the poem titled "Spring"?  i think it might
be...

translations of the horned moon in limnary scripts and liminal screens:

the limnature twined around the golden branch, the laurel sighing her
blood-buds into bloom
enscrypted in cribbed and crabbled writ-wrinkles.  no end to dys-scryption
in the tangled
metallix of fluid writing, a mass of charged glowing wire.  penned and
panting, a limnature
of richesse, embarrassment of enceinture, overflooded by deliverance.  The
horned moon
whispers solace to the pent laurel --limning light on fluid light, silver
on hematite metamorph
being light and dark at once, in the forests of the night, which sounds
like day.  Inspiraled day
twisting around a sustenance bough, redundancy of images discovering their
sentences --plunging
upward toward any source of light, all makes a brave flaming by any means
necessary.

China bans poets conference

November 14, 2000

Web posted at: 10:55 AM EST (1555 GMT)


BEIJING, China (AP) -- Authorities in south China banned an officially
sponsored gathering of poets and arrested three organizers after discovering
that dissident writers were among those invited, a human rights group said
Tuesday.

Government officials feared the forum would demand an easing of heavy-handed
Communist Party controls over literature, the Information Center for Human
Rights and Democracy said.

The Hong Kong-based group said about 200 poets had been expected at the
conference originally planned for November 6-11 at a hotel in Beihai city in
Guangxi province.

Discussion had been expected to focus on developments in modern Chinese
poetry and the formation of a "poet's village" in Beihai, the group said.

The gathering was co-sponsored by the Beihai branch of the Communist Youth
League, the ruling Communist Party's youth wing, and a Beihai poetry review,
the center said.

But authorities banned the meeting and ordered organizers to stop planning
for it after seeing that dissident writers and publishers were on the list
of participants, the group said.

On November 4, police also arrested Beihai poets Wei Manzeng and Jiang Nan,
and Wang Changhuai from nearby Hunan province, for planning the "illegal
gathering," the Information Center said. They are being held in Beihai's
jail, it added.

Dissident writers invited to the meeting included a poet arrested during a
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989, sponsors of underground
poetry reviews and a writer who posted poems on the Internet expressing
dissatisfaction with modern Chinese society, the center said.

A woman at the Beihai Youth League office who gave her surname as Wang
confirmed the conference had been canceled, but said she did not know why. A
police official in Beihai, who gave her surname, Xie, said she had no
knowledge of the three arrests.

The Chinese media is entirely government-controlled and censors keep a
careful eye out for books deemed politically adventurous or risque.

This year, the government temporarily closed at least 13 publishers and shut
down another.

CONTRA LA PENA DE MUERTE

El 30 de noviembre 2000, desde las 18:00 a las 19:00 horas, tender=E0
lugar
una manifestaci=F2n  CONTRA LA PENA DE MUERTE, patrocinada por la Regi=F2n
Toscana (Florencia, Fortezza da Basso). Con motivo de celebrar el
aniversario de la renuncia a la pena de muerte de parte del Granducado
de
Toscana en 1.786 (primeros en el mundo).  En una serie de instalaciones
artisticas, los artistas Tommaso Tozzi y Giacomo Verde, con la
colaboraci=F2n
de muchisimos grupos y asociaciones nacionales e internacionales,
invitan a
ud. (s) a participar a un desfile virtual de protesta contra los sitios
del
Texas Department of Criminal Justice y del Estado de Texas, proponiendo
seguir el netstrike  contra los sitios  de todos  los otros paises donde

a=F9n rige la ley de la pena de muerte (ver mas adelante LA LISTA DE LOS
PAISES DONDE AUN RIGE LA LEY DE PENA DE MUERTE)

"Me parece absurdo que las leyes, que expresan la volumtad p=F9blica, que
detestan y castigan el homicidio, que cometen ellos mismos, para alejar
a
los ciudadanos
del asesinato ordenan un asesino p=F9blico".
Con estas palabras  Cesare Beccaria en 1764 denunciaba la b=E0rbara e
in=F9til
pena de muerte: algunos a=F1os despu=E8s, en 1786, el Granducado de Toscana
abol=ECa la pena de muerte en su estado..

Docientos a=F1os mas tarde, 11.000 hombres y mujeres est=E0n en espera de
ser
ejecutados en uno de los 118 paises que a=F9n mantienen la pena capital.
Solo
en 1998 han sido seguidos almenos 1625 homicidios de Estado y casi 4.000

personas han sido condenadas a muerte.

Ya es hora de decir basta a una pena ineficaz y que pone al mismo nivel
del
criminal la sociedad y el Estado, transformandose en asesinos.
Ya es hora que la sociedad civil mundial haga sentir su voz.
Es hora que t=F9 tambi=E8n hagas algo: basta  un click desde tu casa-junto =
a

otros cientos en todo el mundo - para obstaculizar o hacerlo colapsar el

sitio. La finalidad de la manifestacion es presionar a las Instituciones
de
los paises en los cuales a=F9n  rige la pena de muerte, con el fin de que
suspendan inmediatamente todas las ejecuciones ya previstas y adopten
medidas para abolir definitivamente la pena de muerte, por su propia
disposici=F2n.

El netstrike y sus motivaciones han sido comunicadas ya sea a los
representantes de los sitios del Texas Department of Criminal Justice y
del
Estado de Texas como tambi=E8n  a los principales medios de comunicaci=F2n
y
organizaciones internacionales en grado de difundir antes y despu=E8s la

 NETSTRIKE 214.T - AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY
Texas Department of Criminal Justice
 http://tdcj.state.tx.us/

 or

 State of Texas
 http://www.state.tx.us/

 from 18:00 to 19:00 hrs.



 Tommaso Tozzi and Giacomo Verde, with the co-operation of many groups
and
 national and international associations, would like to invite you all
to participate
 to a VIRTUAL RALLY AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY to protest against the
sites
 of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and of the State of Texas,
which will
 be held within an art event on November 30th 2000, from 18:00 to 19:00
hrs.
 The virtual rally will happen on occasion of a real one sponsored by
the Tuscany
 Region (Florence, Fortezza da Basso) to celebrate the anniversary of
the
 renunciation to the death penalty by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1786
(the
 first country in the world). The artists also suggest repeating the
netstrike
 against the sites of all those countries where the death penalty is
still provided
 for by the law (see the enclosed LIST OF COUNTRIES WHERE THE DEATH
 PENALTY IS STILL PROVIDED FOR BY THE LAW).

 =ABIt seems to me absurd that the law, which is the expression of public
will, and
 despises and punishes homicide, commit one themselves, and, to
discourage
 citizens from committing assassinations, order public assassination=BB.
Cesare
 Beccaria used these words in 1764 to denounce the barbaric and useless
 character of the death penalty: a few years later, in 1786, the Grand
Duke of
 Tuscany abolished the death penalty in his state.

 More than two hundred years later, 11,000 men and women are awaiting
 execution in one of the 118 Countries which still have the death
penalty.
 Only in 1998 at least 1625 State homicides were committed and nearly
4000
 people were condemned to death.

 It is time to say stop to an ineffective punishment which transforms
society and
 the State into assassins, putting them on the same plane as the
criminal.

 It is time for the world's civil society to make its voice heard.
 It is time for you to do your bit too: just click from home - together
with
 hundred of other people in the whole world - to jam the site and break
it down.
 The purpose of the rally is to pressurise the Public bodies of those
countries
 which still provide for the death penalty, so they immediately put off
pending
 executions and adopt provisions to definitively abolish the death
penalty from
 their legal systems.

 The netstrike and its motivations have been communicated both to the
 representatives of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the State
of Texas
 sites and the main international media and organisations able of
spreading the
 news both pre-emptively and successively.

 So connecting repeatedly (at the same time as thousands of other people
in the
 whole world) to these websites:

 Texas Department of Criminal Justice
 http://tdcj.state.tx.us/

 or

 State of Texas
 http://www.state.tx.us/

 from 18:00 to 19:00 hrs.

JEANNIE WEISSGLASS: PAINTINGS

MARC LESTER YU=92S  PAT THE BUNNY

@ Ethan Cohen Fine Arts     37 Walker Street (between Church&Broadway)


Ethan Cohen Fine Arts welcomes you to Jeannie Weissglass=92 Paintings and


Marc Lester Yu=92s Pat The Bunny both opening November 16, 2000 from 6-8 PM.


In this pairing, we see the work of two New York artists. Weissglass, a


provocative colorist creates lavish and dense landscapes of the figure,


animal and sea. Marc Lester Yu=92s  installations absolve color for a


neutrality and careful uniformity of minimalist sculpture in vinyl and mixed


media. Both embark on different treatments but share common themes of the


figure as animal.=20



Weissglass=92 work is fluid, attending to a formal landscape skewed by the


gesture of the brush. Her lush colors layer the canvas The range and the


integrity of her formal visual discernment through her medium of oil on


canvas is astounding. While the subject becomes both distant and elevated, i=
t


maintains a crepuscular yet vibrant resolution. Yu=92s work "confront[s] thr=
ee


life-changing realms of violence, sexuality, and aesthetics."  Yu=92s work i=
s



adventurous, pushing the line towards other materials which draws the viewer


into the spectacle which is also the space of installation.=20



Both Weissglass and Yu create storyboards. Whether it is a story inhabiting


a childhood-to-adolescence inquiry or an evocative figure flung into the


natural world, both delve into a dramatic closing of the impending and


looming subjectivity of form. Whereas Weissglass=92 animals, birds and


crocodiles blend within its surroundings to jar a blissful composition, Yu=
=92s


animals are witty (along with the titles). We see two dramatic statements


careful in exposing or enhancing a literal narration.=20



Marc Lester Yu=92s work is currently on display at PS1 Jeannie Weissglass ha=
s


previously exhibited at Art in General, Artists Space and CityArt Projects o=
f


New York.=20

Reading Report
Last reading was a terrific blow-out. We celebrated the release of
Ixnay 5 and Kevin Varrone's g-point almanac. While I was introducing
the evening's players and urging people to vote on Tuesday November
7, 00 a teamster walked in holding over his head a Gore/Lieberman
poster. I told him I was voting for Nader but that he was welcome to
hang out, hear the poetry, and organize the potential voters.

Jenn and Chris were wonderful co-hosts. I hope they sold lots of
magazines. And o, I never got my copy.

Kevin gave a beautiful reading of g-point almanac. He's such a quiet
guy it was amazing to hear him say so many words in one night. Jena
raised the bar for Highwire-in-a-bar by reading some heady new work.
And Frank Sherlock went "Ghost Dog", he was Zen-rapper.

The night was wrapped up by surprise-guest Kim Soli. Her
dominatrix-like attire and Betty Boop demeanor threw the avant garde
for a loop. Myself included.

And a big shout out to Aaron Levy and Alec for getting me home
safely. See you next time.

Hello, list.

I've been asked to leak some news about
the secret poetry magazine that is at
www.canwehaveourballback.com.  Their
3rd issue is now up.  Check it out
if you like.

Their primary e-mail account was

Go.com, owned by Disney, has closed
their e-mail account because:

"The first name, last name or member name
you entered during the registration process
contains combinations of letters\numbers

Repeated messages to go.com have
gotten no response.

If you are trying to get in touch
with can we have our ball back?, please
send e-mail to canwehaveourballback@hotmail.com.

can we have our ball back? has lost many
files and addresses.  They'd love to hear
from you, even if it's just a quick hello.
Issue 4.0 should appear 12/15, and they'd
love submissions.  Holiday poems are very
welcome.

Thanks.
Jim

I'm enjoying UQP's recently released
New and Selected Poems by Dimitris
Tsaloumas. He's a terrific poet and his
wit is often very pleasing in its capacity
to highlight such things as cultural vanity.

A poem I've long liked from his Portrait
of a Dog collection, is called "The Festival",
to quote it in part,

    Trouble is our city,
rash and precocious, thinking
itself of age, shopped round
for what was hard to find
and out of air and drums
wrought heroes, gods and bards
who in that sonorous shape
now fart nonstop and louder
than the imported kind.
On days of fast they bang
and boom (some by remote
control) and drive us round
the bend by force of sturm-
und-drang. Next week's their fear-
ful fest. But let them have
their ball: I'll come and share
the comfort of your nest.

                (p.219)


It's great to have Dimitris in Melbourne
and perfect that this most distinguished
of Australian poets, always spends the
Melbourne Writers' Festival in Greece.
Great book, and good to see University
of Queensland Press still publishes good
skilled poetry which isn't necessarily
fashionable.

cheers

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Special SFSU alumni reading
EUGENE GLORIA & CATALINA CARIAGA
Thursday afternoon, November 16, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

EUGENE GLORIA's first book, Drivers at the Short-Time Motel (Penguin, 2000)
was selected by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa for
publication in the National Poetry Series.  Komunyakaa writes of Gloria's
work that it's "propelled by an imagistic sincerity and paced lyricism. . .
=2E  Though many of the poems address the lingering hurt of cultural and
economic imperialism, worlds coexist in the same skin through magical
imagery.  These wonderful poems are trustworthy."  Mr. Gloria, an alumnus
of SFSU, was born in Manila, Philippines, and raised in San Francisco.  He
teaches at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana.

CATALINA CARIAGA's first book, Cultural Evidence, from the Subpress
Collective, based in Honolulu, was just selected as one of eight books
honored by the PEN America Open Book Program 2000.  "Cultural Evidence  is
evidence that waves of the Asian Pacific can arrive upon the sandy shores
of American English" -Victor Hernandez Cruz.  Ms. Cariaga was born in Los
Angeles, studied music as an undergraduate, and is also an SFSU alumnus
(MFA in creative writing).  She lives in Oakland.

are poets speaking?
"We are living from and speaking from the self, person, body, or actor, =
all of which I refer to as the (...)." Gendlin, p. 81

just rediscovered a vital trend of thought and living that has been =
ignored in the narrow confines of endlessly repeated philosophical and =
cultural references in internet circles and apparently in academic =
circles in the midst of trying to be in.=20

Gendlin and Schneider are the tip of the iceberg, but there is not much =
on the internet - i guess they're busy living.

"Speaking from your (...) carries it forward and opens and develops it =
further." p. 82

Eugene Gendlin, "Implicit Entry and Focusing," The Humanistic =
Psychologist, Spring,
1999, XXVII, No. 1, Special issue on understanding existence.



"Failure to create carnival [or the fluid center] means revolution, pure =
and simple....I am
advocating for a self and culture that can go hand in hand, that are =
fluid, but that can
respect the integrity of the whole.  To do otherwise, is to keep turning =
out selves who
evolve wonderully in our offices or theoretical treatises (or, on the =
other hand, explode)
once they are turned back out into the status quo.=20

        Thank you for the news Ron Silliman--

        though actually --doesn't one wonder sometimes what disappointment
in their senses  of their own dangers, powers, places in the
poltical structures of life

        many poets might not feel if they didn't know some poets, some
where, were being arrested for something?

        since some one recently had raised for  the ooooooooth time
on this list that hoary spectre of that moonstrous shiboleth &
monumentnal nostrum--

        is a poet a poet only when published?

        (diagnsed by curious antiquarian physicians as dementia
of the ego/identity function characterized by an obseesion with seeing
one's name in print in some form presented by knowledgable authorities as
a publication which also bears their justifying names, certifying that
one is ideed a poet and one indeed has produced a published piece of
poesy,complete with a page number, one's name and a title--moe
or less poetic--)

        shd one begin extending the criteria

        to say --is a poet only a poet if imprisoned at some point
in their career--not only within the rules and lines and pages of a
text--but
also behind the bars and regulations and discourses of the
Correctional System

        (overseen by such beings as editors/wardens, white out/armed
guards and so on--)

        (or the elite delete key--)

        (which "leaves not a trace" . . . )


        perhaps in some obscure way this is why Borges, going blind in an
Argentinian library creates Pierre Menard, who sets out to rewrite DON
QUIXOTE--and in doing so word for word--makes a better version, a copy
which
surpases the original--of Cervanntes' work, which was written in large
part in prison . . .

        by the way--

        has anybody heard from Francois Villon lately?

        last time he was here, he said he'd be back before winter . . .

Hi noble Poetics pundits,

In the act of forwarding Alan Sondheim's breathtaking
poem about not having enough bandwidth or megaherz, I
notice that I'm wondering about where the linebreaks
were originally supposed to be.

Am I the only cyberreader who cares about linebreaks
and their fragility in cyberpublication?

This posting is a reminder of the deadline for registering/submitting
proposals to participate in "E-POETRY, 2001: An International Digital
Poetry Festival", to be held be held in Buffalo, New York, April 19-21,
2001. The Festival promises to be a historic gathering of poets and writers
engaged in new media work. The deadline for registering/proposing was Nov.
15th but with this reminder I would like to allow any interested parties
through the end of November to respond. Details about the conference can be
found at the Festival web page (http://epc.buffalo.edu/e-poetry/2001/).
Though it may be possible to attend the conference without registering now,
presenting/performing will be nearly impossible if proposals are not sent
at this time. Apologies for any cross-posting.

sociopoetic rank and dropping the level here some more.</sarcasm>

Seriously, I work in IT.  I enjoy it.  It expands the way I think and adds
to my life.  It pays my rent and even affords me some time to write.
Considering the relatively shitty level of poetry and poetics writing from
full-timers both fair and (usually) smug, I take personal offense at your
remarks.  I pay nothing for "real" poetry ("real" poetry is free, just look
around yourself if you can see it, and I think you can see it).  I don't
feel I open some new "panorama" in the color to which you point just because
I work in IT, certainly not in the tone you imply.

I humbly ask you to keep your mind open.  Generally an open mind allows
people to learn and grow.  Yes, this person could indeed be a bloodsucker,
capital steeped in crimson and all that.  As in *any* arena, there's always
that possibility.  Just look at poetics.  But he also might be a fairly
decent human being misguidedly looking for a poem for his daughter, perhaps
because he might love her in a misguided way.

Bottom line is, poetry IS for sale.  I don't sell it, but most people here
are constantly selling it.  Some people here are even poetry professionals.
Professional poets, teachers, critics, poseurs, etc.   Getting salaries and
comfy tenure couches, etc., etc.  This is no moral crisis; everything is for
sale.  everything always HAS come down to resources.  someone who thinks he
or she is more pure of heart simply because of a difference of resources
needs his or her gaskets replaced.

the rich think they're better than the poor, because of standing and volume
of possessions, the poor think they're better than the rich because they
have been ennobled by suffering, and the academician, neither rich nor poor
(usually more rich than poor) but landed by education and writing the Great
Unread, thinks he is better than everyone else simply because he has more
footnotes and a more "informed" taste.

People are pretty damned funny.  It's more enjoyable to laugh than to cry.

Of course some of you will take this as a defense of avarice or an attack on
academics or resentment.  But then, this is an imaginative group, isn't it?

Now HERE'S a real opportunity. I hope Mr. Louis' e-mail is flooded with
eager applicants for this job. Just out of curiosity, how much is the IT
Manager for Silicon Capital Limited willing to PAY for the privilege of
having a real Poetics List member write him a real poem about "the spring
season"? And will his daughter use said poem as her own, "sampling," as it
were, the contents? Would the poet be offered round-trip air fare to counsel
the daughter for the contest?

I'd been pretty discouraged about the level of discourse on the List lately,
but this opens all sorts of new panoramas.

FIFTH SUB VOICIVE COLLOQUIUM - CALL FOR PROPOSALS

central London location
29th September 2001
exact times to be announced

Theme: How do we perform that?

Proposals are invited.

Please send an outline of your proposal, in not more than 250 words.

Send your proposals by email to sv.poetry@virginnet.co.uk with the subject
line SVC5 PROPOSAL

OR send by post with stamped addressed envelope or international reply
coupon to:

SVC5, 32 Downside Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5HP UK

Deadline for receipt of proposals: It doesn't work like that. If you are
interested in contributing as a leading / initiating speaker, please express
interest quickly even if you want a little longer to send your proposal.

Expansion of theme: What is the relationship between what is on the page and
what is performed, visually, aurally and gesturally?

This question is clearly central to the performance of visual poetry, but
the Fifth Sub Voicive Colloquium will aim to look at any or all aspects of
innovative and investigative poetry

Background information:- Because the event is a colloquium, the day will be
structured to encourage informed talk between all present across a range of
related topics.

Contributors are asked to lead and stimulate discussion on these topics, as
they help to initiate them, by speaking for perhaps 15 minutes in such a way
as to encourage response, for which another 15 minutes is scheduled; they
are asked to try not to prepare a full text (and not to prepare an academic
paper even if their work will lead later to an academic paper) and to speak
extempore as much as possible.

In this way, all present will be able to participate fairly fully

The Sub Voicive Colloquia grew out of the concerns of Sub Voicive Poetry
readings and remain intimately concerned with the implicit evolving agenda
of that reading series. It is strongly suggested that familiarity and
sympathy with that agenda is a prerequisite for leading contributors to the
SV Colloquia. On the other hand, it is intended that the colloquium itself
will be open to all who wish to attend, attend to and join the discussions.

Those who are unfamiliar with Sub Voicive Poetry are referred to the
extensive documentation at
http://matrix.crosswinds.net/members/~subvoicivepoetry/

I'm hopeful that people on this list might have top tips for me on
articles discussing the fate, uses, reception etc. of funny poetry -- that
is, how has poetry that's often funny (one thinks of Kenneth Koch, Ron
Padgett, Edward Lear, etc.) been treated by "academic" or
"mainstream" critics?  I'm having trouble locating articles/essays that
deal with such questions.  Please backchannel suggestions to
dkane@panix.com.  thanks in advance.

I've done a kind of sound poem at http://vispo.com/vismu/OppenDoDown.htm.
It's an interactive shockwave 8 piece that also needs a pair of speakers.
It's an exploration of layers of sound.

There's a related piece at http://vispo.com/vismu/prototype101.htm. This one
also involves sequences.

The downloads are 300-500k. They're not streaming yet.

just a gentle reminder:

some ways you can support POG (which seriously needs support, to the tune of
a few thousand dollars to balance our 2000-2001 budget):

--POG t-shirts are $15 (m,l,xl,xxl)

--POG ONE anthology is $10

--season subscription is $30; or become a sponsor ($50) or patron ($100) and
(if you like) get listed as such on our publicity--AND get one free gift
(sponsors) or two (patrons): from among t-shirt, POG ONE, POG TWO (due out
in early spring).

t-shirt, anthology, and subscription/sponsor/patron forms are available at
all POG events.

or: reply to this email, make a pledge, and (if you like) we can figure out
how to get your goods and gifts to you before the next POG event (!).

eternal gratitude, artistic benisons, etc etc bestowed on all donors!

happy Thanksgiving to all,

Tenney (Nathanson, for POG)

Happy Turnkey Day from the lockdown snow-in lovefest that is Buffalo, NY!

Handwritten Press is pleased to announce the first publication of Alicia
Cohen, entitled _b EAR_.

This is a book of incredible insight.  The blanks in the poems are full of
what creates them; words, syllables and phrases connect precisely as if
across synapses of intellect and intuition.  Words and histories flash and
fall, opening mind, affect, fields of clashing possibility.  Some of these
poems "take place" in and respond to specific locations, including Buffalo,
NY, where Alicia recently lived for about 5 years.  The stark white cover
and green leaves of paper in the form of the book are one small way we
tried to embody that.  (8.5 "x 8.5", white hand-torn watercolor paper
cover, japanese box stitch binding, 71 pp, $7)

There is also a second edition of the book _Project Experience:  Museums,
Archives, Monuments, Bureaus_ by Joshua Schuster.  This delicate passport
into the agency within the institution excited a number of readers in 1999
and SPD keeps telling me they need more.  This edition is not hand-sewn,
but side-stapled - only because the printer accidentally stapled them and
being a busy grad student I took it as a sign.  (3"x 5", modeled on the US
passport, 49 pp, $3)

Please send orders to Small Press Distribution.  http://www.spdbooks.org

You can preview these books on our website.  Keep in mind that images
within acutal books often do not make it into the website edition.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An evening with poets
JENNIFER MOXLEY & FANNY HOWE
Thursday, November 30, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Two of the most discerning lyric voices in contemporary poetry share the
stage tonight.  JENNIFER MOXLEY, born and raised in southern California,
now lives at a perfect diagonal across the country in Orono, Maine.  Her
books of poetry include the remarkable debut volume _Imagination Verses_
(Tender Buttons, 1996) and, recently, _Wrong Life_ (Equipage, UK, 1999).
She edited the magazine _The Impercipient_, and, with Steve Evans, The
Impercipient Lecture Series.  Ms. Moxley's poetry--"with a nose for small /
powers and their logics"--balances rhetorical elegance, philosophic doubt,
and a spirited communitarian conviction.

=46ANNY HOWE's _Selected Poems_ was just published in UC Press's New
California Poetry series.  ". . . one of our most vital, unclassifiable
writers. . . .  The transparency of her music is deceptive, encompassing
the complexities of philosophic and ethical speculation, always testing. .
=2E .  In that chasm between the ways of the world and our ways of
understanding, we remain, as Howe puts it, 'bewildered.'  This bewilderment
comprises both a 'poetics and an ethics,' a vocation that acknowledges
suffering while refusing to succumb to despair.  The poem then becomes a
bridge to survival."  (Ammiel Alcalay, VLS).  A Boston native, Ms. Howe
lives in Los Angeles and teaches at UC San Diego.

This event is supported by Poets & Writers, Inc. through a grant is has
received from The James Irvine Foundation.

Reading Report
Last reading came-off wonderfully despite some last minute
pre-reading hijinx. Wendy Kramer was a no-show. She called Frank
Sherlock at 5 P.M. the night of the reading and told him, "I'm at
Penn Station. I lost my ticket. I guess I'm not coming." Frank was so
totally shocked that he couldn't come up with a response quick enough
to persuade her to come anyway.

Frank and I sat in his living room trying to devise a solution while
Matt McGoldrick looked at an art book and busted our chops. Frank
thought we should get a replacement. I thought we could all use an
hour of Don Riggs. We decided we could only ask a substitute that
possessed a level of professionalism so high that they could just
walk on stage. They should also be good natured enough to not get
bent out of shape for the last minute request. We couldn't think of
anyone. We thought of asking Kyle Conner, but we assumed he was
working late.

We left for La Tazza hoping that Kim Soli would be there with her
notebook and be willing to read. We also thought of asking Matt's
friend Sean. He's not a poet, but he's from Fishtown and tells
hilarious and bawdy stories. We thought he'd really loosen up the
crowd.

When Frank and I arrived at La Tazza I saw David Kirschenbaum in the
corner sitting with C.A. Conrad. I looked at Frank and said, "There's
our man. David Kirschenbaum. He'll do it, he'll have the work."

So David filled in for Wendy and did a marvelous job. He saved the
game. He read lots of baseball poems. He read a piece about making
love with a woman in Anselm B's bed back in San Francisco. Which made
me throw my head back in shock.

A table of French people sat in the back. They talked throughout the
reading. Jenn McCreary said this is going to get ugly. Frank
considered throwing a book at them. I thought it was funny. Poets can
learn from working a tough room. And I did hear more than one of them
say more than one time, "Appollinaire! Appollinaire!"

Don Riggs was the bard of all bards. He read all sonnets. He downed a
glass of wine in one gulp just before reading. He told great
anecdotes about leaving teaching as a professor to get an MFA at
Temple, about the Washington Senators, and wrestling with cyclops.

Report of a talk


I gave a talk to a few of McKenzie Wark's students and others and stumbled
through the entire thing, the result of no sleep and even for the first
time an inability to focus; I felt sick. But I did manage to talk about -
taking off from Anthony Wilden's work of a few decades ago - the radical
moment we live in, a moment in which the digital regime begins to replace
the analogical. I talked about, apologizing all the while for exhaustion,
the relation of the analogical to deep identity, identity all the way
down, and the digital in relation to skittered surface equivalences - and
the differences between the two. Equivalence has no original; entities are
defined by attributes and solely by attributes, as if what it does in any
particular case, any other within the regime does in any particular case.
But from identity, nothing can be determined... I spoke about tolerances
as well as facticity - a tree represented by a single pixel in relation to
another pixel representing a second tree, the pixels equivalent - and what
that says about the identity of the referent, if anything. Half falling
over, I briefly described Tarski's work on truth (it was Tarski who cri-
tiqued Spencer Brown's Laws of Form, which I discussed briefly afterwards)
- as well as truth both in terms of deep identity (bringing in Saul Krip-
ke's theory of rigid designators, natural kinds, and possible worlds), and
equivalences - skittered and situational truths requiring almost a Tertul-
lian to look for grounding in absurdity - the alternative being proto-fas-
cism. I spoke about mediaspace as well, a combination of analog and dig-
ital regimes of projections and introjections. I talked about language as
performativity, and the different phenomenologies of linux prompts on one
hand and microsoft windows systems on the other - areas of the screens de-
fined as potentials, closed source vs. open source software (appliance and
structural/configurable models), and using programs as catalysts for writ-
ing. Utterly exhausted and swimming in seminar space, I spoke about the
Book/Ends conference in Albany I had recently attended, and how the mourn-
ful attitude of the Derrideans towards the book was based on notions of
deep truth and identity; it was this identity regime that was becoming in-
creasingly problematized, as evident from intellectual property issues,
privacy issues, censorship issues, and so forth, online. I also talked
about the media people at the conference, and their feeling of exclusions
- as well as excitement over working and skittering across borders and
protocols, working towards planetary distribution systems. I talked about
how the media people talked a lot about protocols and techniques and shar-
ing these things, all of which are, like intensely situated truths, skit-
tered equivalences, interoperabilities in computer terms. So that it was
in a sense an entire older vision of the humanities, of human-ism, that
was at stake here. Almost entirely asleep, the outline from the pda so
blurred I couldn't read it, I spoke about translations of analog into dig-
ital and digital into analog, and the notions of generations in videotape
- analog lasting with 3/4" for example maybe five generations at the most,
while digital can last thousands, with intensely slow accumulations of
errors, since the potential well - the plateau of writing - was much high-
er than the level of random noise (very high signal to noise ratio). I
spoke as well about fluidity, and the influence Brossard, Irigaray, and
Kristeva have had on my work, and how on one hand one might consider flu-
idity as a fundamental characteristic of the internet, and, on the other,
there are also hackers and others who find the net a domain of potential
and totalized power, not fluid at all but penetrable, able to be violated,
controlled. Stumbling near the equipment table, I mumbled about gender on
internet relay chat, and some of Nikuko's activities there. Nearly sound
asleep and shaking with exhaustion by this point, I concluded by reading
two texts from the mediaspace series. After dinner with a few people, I
returned with Azure to the media center. Foofwa has already left on a bus
and we continue here, living in mediaspace 67, for a few more days. I
write, still shaking, into the night. Azure is asleep. I think about fun-
damental ontologies and their relationship to the analogical and identity
- which I also talked about, deep ontologies - and problematized epistem-
ologies of digital partial-domains always already undergoing reconnection
- always already surface and skittered. Tonight I'll read in bed again,
trying once more to make everything whole, or at least livable for anoth-
er day. Tomorrow, I'll send this out.

I will be reading at the 11th Street Bar on Monday, November 27th, along
with Jason Schneiderman, Kathleen Ossip, and--oops--I forget the name of the
fourth person, but she's a fabulous poet by all accounts.

The reading begins at 8 pm.
The 11th Street Bar is at 510 East 11th Street, between Avenues A & B.

This is Jason's and my first Duelling Boyfriend Poets reading.

Hope to see you there.

(People on my distribution list who live beyond a 50-mile radius of New York
City are automatically excused.)

Yours,
Michael

Of course some of you will take this as a defense of avarice or an attack on

academics or resentment.  But then, this is an imaginative group, isn't it?

Ah yes, more "common" sense from the privileged.  After all, there are many
talented souls out there who still cannot afford computers, and are therefore
excluded from our digital game.  Amen, Patrick.  The myth of the moral high
ground has always concealed an appetite for power.  I, as one poet/acco, do
not take offense.  In fact, I've spent years suggesting to students this very
lesson.  Historically, the victim is usually the potential, albeit less
powerful, exploiter, which doesn't excuse the victimization, of course.
Actually, I took your remarks as an offense to the Amish, though I was on my
fourth vodka at the time.  Here are two bits that jumped out at me the other
day:

"The Superior Man resolves to walk alone, and is caught in the rain.  He
becomes bespattered and people murmur against him.  Where is the blame in
this?"

                                                       --The I Ching

"They sent for an ambulance, and one was sent.  Somebody got lucky, but it
was an accident."

                                                        --Bob Dylan

Ted Byrne & Summi Kaipa

Ted Byrne gives his first reading in San Francisco, continuing a long time
practice of poetic exchange between our city and Vancouver, BC. He is
currently a Director of the Trade Union Research Bureau in Vancouver, and is
a member of the Kootenay School of Writing Collective. He is the author of
Aporia (1989). Byrne is currently working on a novel entitled Beautiful
Lies, portions of which have
been published in the journals Raddle Moon, and W, and as chapbooks by
Sprang Texts and Friends of Runcible Mountain. Beautiful Lies is truly a
marvel of what can be done with prose, a joy and terror to read. He also
often works in translation. With the late Charles Watts, he organized the

Without ever seeming "trendy," Summi Kaipa infuses her poetry and prose with
the daring energy and fun of pop music. She is a wry observer of the
cultures that surround her, and a participant too, jumping off the bleachers
to grab the ball and sink it into the basket. Summi Kaipa lives in San
Francisco, where she edits Interlope, a journal of innovative Asian American
poetics. Kaipa's critical and creative work has appeared in In These Times,
San Francisco Bay Guardian, Rain Taxi, St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter,
Chain, Rhizome, Kenning, and Fourteen Hills Review. Her first chapbook, The
Epics, was published by Leroy in December 1999. Her most recent literary
endeavors have appeared in self-published chapbooks entitled Forecast or
Some Obscene Dare; Westward Ho; and In the Event
of the Tropics, Your Cushion is Also a Rose.

Those who took note of LINGUA FRANCA's unseemly joy at their role in the Sokal affair and the comeuppance of SOCIAL TEXT may take interest in the brief "APOLOGY" that appears on pg. 9 of the current issue -- where we learn that LINGUA FRANCA seems to have published an article in which "several passages . . . were reproduced nearly verbatim" from the CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION, a publication we had some reason to suppose the editors at LF perused with some frequency.  LF apologizes to the CHRONICLE and its writers,,,,, but no mention of any apology to those of us in the broad class of readers ----

a stiff dose of peer reviewing might well be advised on all sides?

  Dear Colleagues,

 I am asking you to forward this position announcement to anyone you know
who might be interested. It is a tenure track position in the School of
Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis. As many of you know, I have a new position in the School after
teaching at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design for fourteen years,
in the design division. My profile is at:
http://www.sjmc.umn.edu/faculty/gaiter.html

 I was hired by the University last spring as part of the New Media
Initiative in the College of Liberal Arts. For more information, go to this
web site: http://www.sjmc.umn.edu/publ/fact3.html

 Taking this position was a leap of faith for me and the School of
Journalism. My concern was that the school, in spite of good intentions,
might not truly be ready to include someone from a completely different
disciplinary background. So far, my experience has been fabulous. I am
impressed with their dedication to truly thinking outside the box. I have
opportunities to collaborate and work with people in other departments. The
students are interested in new media, are motivated, and have been accepted
to the school through an application process. I have received a grant from
the University with someone in graphic design to conduct a digital
narrative experimental workshop. I have also received a grant for an
interactive web site about "Unofficial Communication," public unsanctioned
writings and messages, including graffiti and signs of all kinds.

 The School is genuinely interested in hiring more visual artists as part
of this initiative, and encouraging exhibitions and art activity instead of
journal articles. The criteria for tenure is not limited to traditional
journalism activities.

 We are especially interested in people with interest and experience in
digital video. The department has a newly renovated building with state of
the art equipment. We are partners in a broadcast quality digital video
studio on campus that rivals any local commercial television station in its
capability.

 The School has recently received a gift of $10 million from the Hubbard
Broadcasting Company. This web site contains the press release and details.
http://www.sjmc.umn.edu/event/gift.html

 For information about the New Media Institute, go to this site:
http://www.sjmc.umn.edu/publ/fact4.html

 This is the Journalism School's web site: http://www.sjmc.umn.edu/


 *******Even though the announcement has a preferred deadline of October 6,
2000, there are six positions to fill and we will look at applications
until they are filled.

 Please contact me if you have questions and I will direct you elsewhere if
necessary.

 I am particularly looking forward to having colleagues from the creative
world. However, as the announcement indicates, the range of disciplines and
backgrounds is broad. The School is interested in innovators--from whatever
discipline. The New Media Initiative is truly interdisciplinary--trying to
get at the root of this mysterious thing, "New Media," that we are all
trying to understand.

Well, I read the item below Baudelaire on that site's product line list as
being "Barthology." Must be those French scents...

But it does remind me that one of my strangest publications was an excerpt
from Sunset Debris in Wet: the Journal of Gourmet Bathing (edited by Howard
Rheingold before he became a web guru).

Two beekeepers discover a bath.
They last longer and smell better.

They explore the air in the bubbling clear
& will the wildflowers to fill our fields
with a bumblebee paradise, honey rub-a-dub.

With biblical glow of a skin awash in a tub
gardeners of honeycombs count their hives,

buzzing formulae for bungling landed funds and head-cases
like gift soaps more dense than the fat of dead poets
they pressed into fragrant deodorizers for the barely buzzing.

I'm translating some Hans Arp poems for fun and would like to know if  =
"parapluie" in the line "auf dem meer verwirrte er die schiffe mit dem =
woertchen/ parapluie..." is a non-lexical word, as I understand it to =
be.  I understand it to be something like 'all over the place', or 'with =
no real discretion'.  In the same poem (no title. first line: weh unser =
kaspar ist tot) he uses another word 'heufische' in the line "die =
heufische klappern in den glocken..." which I take to be the conjunction =
of hay and fish.. so literally  something like "the patter of fish in =
the grass/hay.." Is this right or am I missing some associations??  If =
anone could offer some advice I'd be grateful.

An evening with poets
JENNIFER MOXLEY & FANNY HOWE
Thursday, November 30, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

Two of the most discerning lyric voices in contemporary poetry share the
stage this Thursday.  JENNIFER MOXLEY, born and raised in southern
California,now lives at a perfect diagonal across the country in Orono, Main=
e.
Her books of poetry include the remarkable debut volume _Imagination Verses_
(Tender Buttons, 1996) and, recently, _Wrong Life_ (Equipage, UK, 1999).
She edited the magazine _The Impercipient_, and, with Steve Evans, The
Impercipient Lecture Series.  Ms. Moxley's poetry--"with a nose for small /
powers and their logics"--balances rhetorical elegance, philosophic doubt,

=46ANNY HOWE's _Selected Poems_ was recently published in UC Press's
NewCalifornia Poetry series.  Her latest book of new poetry, _Forged_, is
also out, from Post-Apollo Press.  ". . . one of our most vital, unclassifia=
ble
writers. . . .  The transparency of her music is deceptive, encompassing
the complexities of philosophic and ethical speculation, always testing. .
=2E .  In that chasm between the ways of the world and our ways of
understanding, we remain, as Howe puts it, 'bewildered.'  This bewilderment
comprises both a 'poetics and an ethics,' a vocation that acknowledges
suffering while refusing to succumb to despair.  The poem then becomes a
bridge to survival."  (Ammiel Alcalay, VLS).  A Boston native, Ms. Howe
lives in Los Angeles and teaches at UC San Diego.

Unless I've really forgotten all my high school French, I believe Arp has

THE FUTURE OF FORM: READING ON AND OFF THE PAGE

The University of Virginia's
English Graduate Conference 2001
Charlottesville, Virginia

Featuring keynote speakers John Hollander (Yale) and
Marjorie Perloff (Stanford)

As we enter a new century of literary study, we may find
ourselves asking what Gauguin asked 100 years ago:  "Where
do we come from?  What are we?  Where are we going?"
Shifts in literary methodology over the last thirty years
have been edifying and provocative, even as the pace of
these changes has been dizzying.  New historicism, cultural
studies, feminist studies, postcolonial theories, queer
studies, identity studies -- these and other movements have
vastly improved our understanding of literature in context.
While these movements sought to distinguish themselves from
New Critical assumptions and values, many of their
achievements came not through a denial of formalist
techniques, but through new and innovative ways of
"reading," both on and off the page -- ways of reading
which focused upon the critical relationship between the
literary object and its context.

The theme of the 2001 English Graduate Conference at the
University of Virginia is designed to provoke discussion of
these issues.  We are soliciting papers that will further a
productive dialogue on the future of form (and its complex
history) through discussions of literary, cultural, and
theoretical texts.

The conference will be held March 2 and 3, 2001.  We are
happy to announce two keynote speakers: John Hollander of
Yale, the well-known critic and poet who has written
authoritatively on the history of poetic form and its
20th-century transformations; and Marjorie Perloff of
Stanford, arguably our most important critic of modern and
postmodern poetry.  (The subtitle of our conference pays
homage to her _Poetry On and Off the Page_ [1998].)  Two
related events will be of interest: Mr. Hollander will read
his own poetry on the evening of Friday, March 2; and on
Saturday, March 3, Ms. Perloff and Mr. Hollander will join
in a panel discussion with UVA professors Stephen Cushman
and Michael Levenson.

Please send one-page abstracts by January 1 to both
djr4r@virginia.edu and jfp3r@virginia.edu.  We also welcome
panel proposals; these should include a cover sheet that
discusses the theme of the panel and abstracts for each of
the papers.  Possible topics include:

The Future of Form:  New Directions in Formal Practice
Poetics in a New Century
Emergent Genres and Form: Film, Video, Music, Performance
Subversive Forms: Race, Gender, Writing
Bodily Formations
Queer Forms
Close Reading in the Classroom
Reading Audience: Stage, Print, Beyond
Novel Forms
The Formation(s) of Modernity
Formal Self-Fashioning
Humanities Computing: Reforming the Text
The End(s) of Prosody

And Ron Silliman writes:

"hey dudes and guyzies --
there's a soap and scent line named after our charles b, that is
baudelaire (not bernstein, not yet, but i can see the day...).
click on sephora.com, and select "baudelaire" from their
"product lines"

So the obvious connection is this:

What Arp was really meaning by "parapluie" would have to be
a ref to the Baudelaire body spray, and his loss of his favorite
umbrella . . . as well as his discomfort with being but a
sidebar to "that stinky Frenchie".  Mit dem woertchen, indeed.

As always, glad to clear things up.

        "parapluie" in french means "umbrella"

        you must remember, hans arp was fluent in both french and german

Not non-lexical but French, in which language it means "umbrella."  But my
German is far too weak for me to know whether that makes any sense or even
interesting nonsense.

Thanks to those who replied to my post on Hans Arp.  Since I don't speak =
French and am translating between locations and studying Japanese I =
would have left it as is without knowing what it was! 'Heufische'  might =
be like 'sea monkeys in English, by the way.  Unfortunately the book I'm =
using doesn't come with notes (a Reclam I picked up in Cologne), so I =
might be back with some more questions.=20

No "parapluie" is French for "umbrella," and "heufisch" is a pun for
"haifisch"-- shark.

I'm translating some Hans Arp poems for fun and would like to know if
"parapluie" in the line "auf dem meer verwirrte er die schiffe mit dem
woertchen/ parapluie..." is a non-lexical word, as I understand it to be.  I
understand it to be something like 'all over the place', or 'with no real
discretion'.  In the same poem (no title. first line: weh unser kaspar ist
tot) he uses another word 'heufische' in the line "die heufische klappern in
den glocken..." which I take to be the conjunction of hay and fish.. so
literally  something like "the patter of fish in the grass/hay.." Is this
right or am I missing some associations??  If anone could offer some advice
I'd be grateful.

Thanks Mr. Hollo for the translation of these lines.  The refernces to =
fish falling from the sky in yesterdays posts left me in the ocean with =
kaspar.  I'm interested in the 'hay-fish'  in the translation you sent =
(from J. Rothenberg?) and one of the suggestions yesterday that they are =
like seamonkeys. =20
Anyway, I'd like to check out Rothenberg's translations but I simply =
can't afford or get hold of them so my own translations will have to do. =
 Not only that I'm having a hell of a good time doing this.

yes, seems to me it's a pun on the homophonic word "häufig” which means
frequent

My understanding is that "parapluie" means UMBRELLA.  Hope this is helpful!

a day to open channels of communication, strengthen the exchange of
information and experience, and forge a spirit of social tolerance.  The Ear
Inn reading series takes place on Saturdays, so we are observing World AIDS
Day on December 2.

This is our first World AIDS Day reading.  We expect this to be the start of
an annual tradition at the Ear Inn.

Chris Stroffolino will be partaking in a tribute
to Anne Sexton at

The Knitting Factory on December 7th

in the form of the rock band that she put together in the late 70s

we won't play very long, but they're be other stuff involved....

vocalist will be Bestsy Andrews (who will be over her cold by then)
guitar will be Shawn Aron Vandor, of rockband "Man & Wife," (also a poet;
editor of Poetry New York)
and his drummer Ezra whose last name I forget it's not Pound
and on flute will be Sasha Bell of Lady Bug Transistor and Essex Green
I will be on keyboards

the event is 7-9Pm I don't knw if it costs, ask the PSA people like Matt
Rohrer

--------

Also I WILL be reading at the Ear Inn, but on December 16th rather than
on December 9th......(ignore listing below

And, finally (in terms of the "when it rains it pours" dept.) will be

Parapluie is the French word for umbrella (as I'm sure more people than me will mention); I am not offering any advice on the German. Rachel Blau DuPlessis

Actually this is quite appropriate since Baudelaire wrote an "Eloge du
maquillage"--a praise of artificiality and self-disclosing artifice
against the aesthetic ideal of the "natural"


La femme est bien dans son droit, et meme elle accomplit une espece de
devoir en s'appliquant a paraitre magique et surnaturelle; il faut qu'elle
etonne et qu'elle charme; idole, elle doit se dorer pour etre adoree. Elle
doit donc emprunter a tous les arts les moyens de s'elever au-dessus de la
nature pour mieux subjuguer les coeurs et frapper les esprits.

Hi Maria,

Here's my first try:


The United States and Canada began when Baudelaire discovered a smell.
Countries look a little more, are more, last a bit, and smell a lot. So if
you've been exploring the world, looking for a truly natural and authentic
smell, you're Baudelaire.


Best,

Pete

Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Center for Latin
American and Caribbean Studies, the Program in Creative Writing present a
colloquium:

        "Between Caliban and Sycorax:

JAIME MANRIQUE AND EILEEN MYLES
The Washington Post Book World calls Jaime Manrique "a p=EDcaro prone to shoc=
k
his readers by testing the moral standards of his time." And Kennedy Fraser
says, "Manrique=B9s voice is wise, brave, and wholly original." An
accomplished poet and prose writer, Mr. Manrique is the author of the novel=
s
Eminent Maricones: Arenas, Lorca, Puig, and Me; Twilight at the Equator;
Latin Moon in Manhattan; and Colombian Gold, as well as a wide range of
poetry and short story collections. He=B9s currently leading a workshop at th=
e
Poetry Project entitled "The Romantic Tradition."

Eileen Myles=8Bpoet, prose writer, and ex=ADpresidential candidate=8Bis the autho=
r
of the forthcoming novel Cool for You (Soft Skull Press) as well as Not Me
and Chelsea Girls. Of Ms. Myles=B9 writing in Cool for You Jonathan Lethem
says, "She cruises her own life from this platform of language=8Bvernacular,
glinting, gesturing=8Bmaking art of everything she brings aboard." And J.T.
Leroy says, "The way roughness and humor are wrapped in a dangerous excitin=
g
tale=8Ba tale that pulls at my heart and enthralls my psyche=8Bis a stunning
feat that makes Cool For You worthy of much study and massive enjoyment."
Ms. Myles boldly brought poetry and politics together in 1992 when she ran
for President of the United States as an "openly female" write-in candidate
in 28 states. She is a regular contributor to Art in America, Paper, The
Nation, Nest, The Village Voice and The Stranger, and has appeared on MTV.
She curates an innovative series of readings and performances called "Scout=
"
at Threadwaxing Space in New York City.

A Writing Workshop taught by Ed Sanders
A special workshop on the researching and creating of poetry that seeks to
describe aspects of historical reality. How to =8Ctranspose=B9 the throbbing

Foundation. Admission to the workshop is $7, $4 for students and seniors,

Friday, December 8th at 10:30 pm
E-BOOK NIGHT WITH EDWIN TORRES AND RICHARD PEARSE
A reading to celebrate the online publication of Edwin Torres=B9 and Richard
Pearse=B9s latest e-books. Edwin Torres is a "bilingual" poet, rooted in the
languages of both sight and sound. Mingling the textures of poetry with
vocal and physical improvisation, sound-elements, and visual theater, his
live performances create organic landscapes that exist beyond language. His
new collection of poetry, Onamalingua: Noise, Songs & Poetry, will be
released as an e-book with MP3 files and Real Video. Richard Pearse has had
many books of poems published, including Come Back Vanishing (Linear Arts
Books), and a chapbook, Landscape of Skin (Audit Press). Some two dozen
magazines have published his poems and stories, including The Paris Review,
New York Quarterly, Prairie Schooner and Fiction. In 1996 he won fifth priz=
e
in the Chester H. Jones National Competition. His e-book is called Private
Drives.


Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.
The Poetry Project is located in St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2nd
Avenue and 10th Street in Manhattan. The Poetry Project is wheelchair
accessible with assistance and advance notice. Please call (212) 674-0910
for more information or visit our Web site at http://www.poetryproject.com.

What better way to celebrate New Year's Day than to volunteer at the Poetry
Project's 27th Annual New Year's Marathon Reading?! Imagine yourself sellin=
g
books... selling food... checking in readers... setting up chairs...
stacking chairs... all the while doing great service to your local poetry
community! If you are interested, reply to this email with your name and
phone number or email address, and we'll get in touch to schedule you in.

parapluie!

arp bless you.

I've heard a rumor about umbrella translations.  Wooden sticks that blossom
into black silk flowers, or men in long coats exclaiming, "Damnit it's too
small, I'm getting wet!" or have a banana.  Or maybe that's just a fraudian
slip.


You know someone will email and suggest that I really meant freudian, so let
me say this right now
