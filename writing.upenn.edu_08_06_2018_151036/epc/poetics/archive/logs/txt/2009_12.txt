not sure where the written word can go without some assistance. visual poetry/the whole computer generated thing. I'm not so sure that the word is 53 years behind, but it is inherently conservative in some respects.

the word is always character driven, even poetry: character in poetry is the voice or the persona, the mask of any given speaker.
the eye & the ear are promiscious. the word chains one to the page.

Subject: Re: unorthodox vs.innovative poetry

> corrected a friend recently. Why call poetry that breaks from conventions innovative when it's actually unorthodox. & i nominate EE Cummings as the one poet who was innovative/unorthodox/ and popular as... as a singular poet, perhaps the ONE enlish speaking poet of the 20th century who managed t inovation and was also unorthodox & popular.

whether it's innovative depends on the nature of the breaks from convention. or is there orthodox innovation? if there is, does it matter? innovation necessarily involves breaks with convention or there is merely invention.

perhaps in any school of thought, any particular mannerism, there's orthodox innovation. People are still toying around with pop art. Maybe alien abduction folk have discovered something truely new.

GUESS THE HALLUCINATION
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/angkorwat

I've been developing the text nib in dbCinema, the graphic
synthesizer/langu(im)age processor I'm writing. And produced the above
series of 256 images (1100x900) with it.

For five revelations per second, can you tell me the search term used to
fetch the pictures from the Internet used in this series?

I also wrote an essay on related matters that appears at the above URL. A
sample from it:

"William S. Burroughs observed that cutting up cutups didn't seem to work as
well as doing cutups of more intelligible material. The reason why is not
far to seek. Cutups normally operate around the level of the phrase. The
level/length of the phrase can be associated with a higher level of semantic
intelligibility than a level/length/string half the size. Consequently, the
semantic intelligibility of cutups of cutups should  normally be about half
that of cutups of more intelligible material.

This logic suggests that collage/montage/cutup techniques can be analyzed,
in this case, somewhat quantitatively in terms of intelligibility vs
unintelligibility or, in the case of dbCinema, representation vs
abstraction, as well as intelligibility vs unintelligibility. Only here we
are dealing with the semantics of images rather than of natural language..."

McLean Hospital ( Belmont, Mass.) is known as a top shelf psychiatric
hospital with Harvard faculty psychiatrists, groundbreaking research, etc=
...
But it also has been a residency of sorts for poets such as Sylvia Plath,=

Robert Lowell, and Anne Sexton. Poet Doug Holder worked at McLean Hospita=
l
for 27 years and ran poetry groups for patients for over a decade. He has=

interviewed the social worker for Plath and Sexton as well as the manager=
 of
Anne Sexton's rock band, he wrote an introduction to Lowell's classic poe=
m
about the hospital "Waking In the Blue" for Robert Pinsky's anthology
"America's Favorite Poems", he was interviewed by Boston Globe columnist
Alex Beam for material for his controversial book "Gracefully Insane" and=

has talked to many others who provided a trove of anecdotes about these
renowned and tragic poets. In this course we will cover McLean Hospital a=
s a
muse for their poetry, and the experience of these poets in the "Asylum."=

I teach a war literature class, and now I am thinking that a peace literatu=
re class would be good. (My war lit. is actually an anti-war lit. class.) I=
 am trying to think of literature and films that somehow look at peace. Mar=
tin Luther King and Thoreau come to mind.=A0I am not thinking about peace a=
s only an absence of war, but I also want to think about civil disobedience=
 and conflict resolution, or any other way that peace can be considered. A =
woman's perspective would be wonderful.
=A0
Does anyone have any ideas--poetry would be grand, too, although my student=
s struggle with poetry.=20
=A0
Thank you for any ideas that you may have.

Dear Jim,

I have watched Guess the Hallucination series. I had spent a number of days
at Angkor Wat region two years ago, the place from parts of which all the
images in GTH series seem to be taken. Perhaps more than anything else this
series crystalised for me the reasons for my deep dissatisfaction with works
which essentially collages images or words lifted/gleaned from the internet.
There is such an abyss between GTH and the physical experience of the place
-the heat, the arduous walk in multiple days it takes to see the temples,
the clash between Hindu and Buddhist ideologies embodied in the carvings and
statues in them, the political and historical rootedness of these images,
the stunning realization that the Buddha "smile" one is familiar with is
arrived at by a slight "tweaking" through a period of about two hundred
years of the "frown" in Vishna's face, both its ideological rival and
ancestor, the spectacle of the continuous juxtaposition of art of great
beauty with ruins, crumbling walls, protruding tree trunks through windows,
occasionally truncated, gigantic Buddha statues, all making me think of
Walter Benjamin's "Naples" and *The Arcades Project*, lovely, green stagnant
water covered with leaves. The continuous disbelief, as one is walking in
the area, that such a space -a space of dreams as a thread of time- could
have a physical existence, as if being told Santa Claus really existed and
finding it is true. The hallucinatory power of Angkor Wat is multiple times
greater than the one achieved through the maniplulation of internet images
in Gues the Hallucination. The former requires a walk through often
unbearable heat, over irregular bouldered paths, one to become a "flaneur"
going through concrete time in the absorption of things. What one has in
GTH, it seems to me, is the reverse, a shuffling of flat replicas, at high
speed, drawing attention to its own "artistry," the "art" or the
"literature" it is creating.

I can understand very well the power of the act/gesture which puts a
moustache on Leonardo's Mona Lisa or defaces it by slashing it -temples in
Angkor Wat are replete with defaced images of Vishna which occurred when a
Buddhist king took over the temple.- But to put a moustache on a
reproduction of Leonardo's Mona Lisa is something else. It has to me a touch
of the ridiculous or perhaps, if the awareness of this ridiculousness is
present, it may become a piece of conceptual art...

Ciao,

Murat

a text of possible interest for the course: Surviving Literay Suicide by Jeffrey Berman.
& the book begins with a quote from Frank Zappa:
                                                                                    I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, whaat are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to.But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we love more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.

McLean Hospital ( Belmont, Mass.) is known as a top shelf psychiatric
hospital with Harvard faculty psychiatrists, groundbreaking research, etc...
But it also has been a residency of sorts for poets such as Sylvia Plath,
Robert Lowell, and Anne Sexton. Poet Doug Holder worked at McLean Hospital
for 27 years and ran poetry groups for patients for over a decade. He has
interviewed the social worker for Plath and Sexton as well as the manager of
Anne Sexton's rock band, he wrote an introduction to Lowell's classic poem
about the hospital "Waking In the Blue" for Robert Pinsky's anthology
"America's Favorite Poems", he was interviewed by Boston Globe columnist
Alex Beam for material for his controversial book "Gracefully Insane" and
has talked to many others who provided a trove of anecdotes about these
renowned and tragic poets. In this course we will cover McLean Hospital as a
muse for their poetry, and the experience of these poets in the "Asylum."

=0A=0AWhat constitutes an unpublishable work? It could be many things: too =
long, too experimental, too dull; too exciting; it could be a work of juven=
ilia or a style you've long since discarded; it could be a work that falls =
far outside the range of what you're best known for; it could be a guilty p=
leasure or it could simply be that the world judges it to be awful, but you=
 think is quite good. We've all got a folder full of things that would othe=
rwise never see the light of day.=0A=0AInvited authors were invited to pond=
er to that question. The works found here are their responses, ranging from=
 an 1018-page manuscript (unpublishable due to its length) to a volume of r=
omantic high school poems written by a now-respected innovative poet. You g=
et the idea.=0A=0AThe web is a perfect place to test the limits of unpublis=
hability. With no printing, design or distribution costs, we are free to ex=
plore that which would never have been feasible, economically and aesthetic=
ally. While this exercise began as an exploration and provocation, the resu=
ltant texts are unusually rich; what we once considered to be our trash may=
, after all, turn out to be our greatest treasure.=0A=0AThe series will con=

Kass Fleisher's Talking Out of School (Dalkey Archive) might (in its =
second
section, "Tiers") give you some ideas. It's a good book, great =
narrative.

As for the idea of "Peace Literature", I dunno. Robert Duncan's "Man's
Fulfilment In Order and Strife"? In Caterpillar 8-9 (1969) and in his
Fictive Certainties (1985)

Dear Murat,

It's indisputable that Angkor Wat is one of the genuine spendors of the
world. One look at pictures of Angkor Wat tell us that. Unique. Sprawling.
That 12th century sandstone architecture is just stunning as ruin. I haven't
been there and admire your having gone. I have merely read about it and
looked at pictures.

The piece was done out of regard for and interest in Angkor Wat, however,
not as a moustache-on-Mona-Lisa sort of gesture.

One of the key things in visual poetry is the relation of written/spoken
language to the visual. The net's image search engines have done something
fairly remarkable in linking written/spoken language and images, as they
have. We just type the term we're interested in, and we get back a thousand
somehow related images. Sometimes the connection is obvious, sometimes not.
It's like the one as the collection of all things that are one: nominal. You
get back not something essential but something scattered that perhaps
coheres around one or a few centers. Looking at the pictures becomes an
exploration of the possible meanings and associations of the term.

Part of the idea of dbCinema is to try to do interesting things with these
langu(im)age processors. Like a word processor only a
language-to-image-to-cinema processor.

Another is to offer an alternative notion of cinema for those who, like me,
feel somewhat uncomfortable with the empire of representation and
video/film/etc. It feels relatively healthy, to me, Murat, to be working
toward something that breaks it up toward personal synthesis.

By the way, dbCinema doesn't have to get its images from the Net. The
concept for a brush can be a local folder of images. In either case, the
concept ends up being a collection of images.

i've about played out my 24 hr posting, but here go: from an angel perspective, consider Wings of Desire. A beautiful, lyrical movie inspired by the poetry of Rilke. A European movie that could be shown on American TV. About ... death ... transcending ... memory ... WW11 flashbacks ... Peter Faulk plays Peter Faulk, a star of a popular American detective show. It may still be my favorite all time picture. Great for discussion because it means many things, but nothing is easily resolved.

Directed and co-written with Peter Hanke (a brilliant noveliest, playwright, and sometimes poet), by Wim Wenders.

I teach a war literature class, and now I am thinking that a peace literature class would be good. (My war lit. is actually an anti-war lit. class.) I am trying to think of literature and films that somehow look at peace. Martin Luther King and Thoreau come to mind. I am not thinking about peace as only an absence of war, but I also want to think about civil disobedience and conflict resolution, or any other way that peace can be considered. A woman's perspective would be wonderful.

Dear Mary,=20

I think Martin Luther King got many of his ideas from reading what Gandhi s=
aid about=A0 peaceful protests or non-resistance. Also, I cannot think off =
top of my head which film titles would best fit your subject, but the idea =
of teaching against something or of being anti-something, already assumes t=
he presence of conflict.=A0 I always think that if I come from a place of p=
eace, then the other doesn't exist---the focus on peace or standing for pea=
ce paradoxically makes anything else disappear.=A0 Yes I know that is philo=
sophical or multi-layered in its complexities but so is war and why human b=
eings go to war. I think/believe the commitments we make (as in I am commit=
ted to "World Peace" --which the satirized beauty queens often say) require=
s great discipline in that the person saying it cannot allow themselves to =
go to that other possibility -- which might be seen in war mentality thinki=
ng. As far as literature to teach peace---perhaps Utopian society
 literature--although, even those, end up telling us how those kinds of soc=
ieties didn't or couldn't work (think Road to Omelas?) Sorry read that one =
a long time ago and I cannot remember the correct /full title. I am sure so=
meone on this list will come up with it though.=A0=A0=A0=20

I saw an incredibly peaceful film last year called, "Sweet land" about two =
people who couldn't communicate with each other because they spoke differen=
t languages, so they had to find a way to do that. It was that process that=
 was especially sweet. I thought while watching it what if everyone did tha=
t when they were unable to communicate with each other--not necessarily fal=
l in love (which is what they did) but find ways to overcome their lack in =
communication and that this might result in a long term and enduring relati=
onships with each other where everyone pulls together during hard times etc=
.=A0 Call me a "cock-eyed optimist" or a Pollyanna, I don't care. I just fi=
nd teaching that causes more growth than telling those young sweet faces in=
 our classrooms our world is getting tougher to live in, etc.=20

If I think of anything else --film wise or literature wise, I will write yo=
u again.=20

Dear Jim and Murat:

Are cutups analyzable in the sense Jim writes of?
I think you've not really understood what the cut-ups are for Burroughs,
Jim.  By using "moreintellgible" materials, what he actually writesof is
using writing at ahigher level--that of authors such as someof his
favorites--Rimbaud, conrad, graham Green, T.S. Eliot etc etc--as far as the
"literary aspect" of cut-ups gpoes.

A great deal of Burroughs work with the cut-ups was the daily keeping of
sevral concurrent daily journals--a dream journal, a diary type enrty
journal, a daily collection of headlines and images from the St louis or
other newspapers--and by noting through time the interralationships among
these, their intersections, their sychornicties--creating a way of treavel
in time as well as in space in writing.

At times Burroughs sees the cut-ups made out of these materials as being not
unlike the Mayan Calendar in the sense of "predicting" a future via the
intersections and occurences/recurrences of certain numbers, names and
images.  The number of persons killed in airplane crashes ,  he notes, seem
to be running in a pattern which has often the same numbers rearranged in
different orders--these in turn might link to an image from that day having
to do with the same set of numbers, or with "crash" or "airplanes"--these
leading in turn to his archives of dream images and words--the linking of
the unconscious with concrete conscious events in a way which proliferates
the levels of ti e and consciousness--dream times, dates, numbers--memories
that arise from the configurations of numbers--reminding one of a street
number or number of a lock combination etc--the cutups pen the door to
associative "trains of thought" which combine the intuitive, the unconscious
with the conscious mind.  I think if you read the Burroughs interview from
the Sixties in the Paris review you'll find a good exposition by Burroughs
himself of what a day's work is like for him at that particular time, and
how many hours a day are spent on the cut ups, making a single journal out
of the interlinking entries from the several concurrent ones--

Many  of the questions Burroughs is asking revolve around the idea of life
in a sense being programmed by CONTROL, and deprogramming, s scrambling,
interfering with this CONTROL--CONTROL of the Mayan Calendar variety in
which, for Burroughs,s what happens on a certain date is "fixed" well ahead
of time and so "has to happen" to such a degree that it becomes "natural"
that it happens--a way of CONTROL he also discusses in terms of the word and
image control machines of Time-Life--

The cutups for Burroughs are not random in the sense that so many who
perfrom them after him seem to think that they are--this is part of their
point--how many things even when attempted to being done "randomly' keep
producing images and words and time lines of CONTROL--and the writer's
efforts continually are to "break through in grey room" "where the Reality
Films are made."

This breakthrough into the Control Rooms where the films are made, is helped
to a good extent by personal dreams, memories, personal associations with
numbers and names and also by using writers who posses already a great deal
of imagination so that the imagination of several is also folded into the
cut ups--

In a sense what the cut-ups are an effort at is the resistance to the
machine--ironically enough now there are several machines on line that wil
produce out  of any text fed into it "cutups" which are basically generic,
and so defeat the purpose of Burroughs'
 conception --as they are conformist by their very generic being-

Murat's text with its cutting in and out of literary allusion, its dream
states and sense of floating, open to the concrete structures as the writer
moves among them--the physical sensations of heat and difficult walking (NOT
the flaneur--)--these slow down and make the attention at once far more
direct, slowed, attentive--and speeded up in the sense that that as with
film, the slowing down of the movement of frames creates the speeding up of
an image--so the images become unmoored from their seeming stasis, and,
indeed, one may then see in this intersection of slowness with speed, the
frown of Vishnu transmute into the smile of the Buddha over a two hundred
year period--

The text of Murat's then, participating already in the liminalareas between
dream and concrete diffiuclt to wlk n reality--the liimnal states observed
in historical time as Vishnu becomes slowly buddha--the references to
outside events via such evidences as this transmuattion to the passing of
hhsirtocal, political and econmic times--al these create th enmkind of
"trvel" text which Burroughs' preferred to use in his cut ups when using
literary or non-newspaer writings--Graham Greene for example, he is reading
The Quiet American aboard a ship, and looks up--and there by God IS A Quiet
American ascending the stairs towards him--the novel creating a peron who in
real time is enoucntred by the reader, linked by the title of the book and
the description with in it which matches the real fiugure apporaching--

It is such events that break down the systems of control, while in a sense
the Guess the Hallucination is a reinforcement of Control because it takes
what one might think of as "stock footage" of a myriad images from Malraux's
"Museum without Walls" and runs them together ins such a way as to reiterate
that this is not a hallucination but simply a way of ordering these images
as a "set" among myriad different ways of arranging the images.  Since many
images are ones which are recurring ones in the vast halls of the Museum
without Walls, they acquire a kind of generic "already fixed" quality, in
which what had been the energy at one time of the image is bleached out,
leaving the "virtual copy" as a kind of after image ghost of a once
occurring image that not only time has caused to fade but the fading of eyes
looking at as they are drawn in ever vaster numbers to book and magazine
reproductions fixed in space to virtual images fixed in time--the sort of
"Transcendental" aspect of the virtual i
ve written about, which creates akind of stasis so that time is always "real
time" no matter how old or new the materials are--

This stasis and fixing of what seem an
"eternal" event fixed in "a space of (Real) Time"--begins to acquire the
quality of the inevitability of the Mayan Calendar for Burroughs--or of Time
Life----

This is a fixing of an entropy,  a steady state of an energy level run down
--to the state in which energy is dispersed in such a flat-surfaced way as
to no longer produce any thing other than an immutable stasis--a sense of
being  worn down and crushed by Control, perhaps--

Andre Gide wrote of the works of Louis-Ferdinand Celine--"It is not reality
which Celine presents, but the hallucinations which reality produces."

This is the kind of hallucinatory territory Murat is walking in--not a
static steady state, a fixed immuntable Virtual Real Time--but a liminal
time--moving through time--at once the conjunction of the Eternal and the
ephemeral that Baudelaire stated as the elements creating Modernism--and an
hallucinatory quality provoked by the concrete--which exists in a
taphonomy--that is, in its present state as a real ity underoging the
disintegrations and transmutations of time, and in these energies of decay
and collapse, releasing those energies which provoke indeed, the
hallucinatory aspects arising from reality--as part of a natural process--

"The basis of art is change in the universe" states  the great Japanese
Haiku poet and prose writer Basho--
(in "Learn from the Pine:")--

HI Mary,
=A0
Maxine Hong Kingston led a writing workshop for veterans for many years. Tt=
his book grew out of that work:
=A0
The Fifth Book of Peace=A0 and Veterans of War, Veterans of Peace=A0=20

An earlier book titled The Fifth Book of Peace is also relevant. Here is th=
e Publisher's Weekly blurb copied from Amazon:
From Publishers Weekly
In September 1991, Kingston (The Woman Warrior; China Men; etc.) drove towa=
rd her Oakland, Calif., home after attending her father's funeral. The hill=
s were burning; she unwittingly risked her life attempting to rescue her no=
vel-in-progress, The Fourth Book of Peace. Nothing remained of the novel ex=
cept a block of ash; all that remained of her possessions were intricate tw=
inings of molten glass, blackened jade jewelry and the chimney of what was =
once home to her and her husband. This work retells the novel-in-progress (=
an autobiographical tale of Wittman Ah Sing, a poet who flees to Hawaii to =
evade the Vietnam draft with his white wife and young son); details Kingsto=
n's harrowing trek to find her house amid the ruins; accompanies the author=
 on her quest to discern myths regarding the Chinese Three Lost Books of Pe=
ace and, finally, submits Kingston's remarkable call to veterans of all war=
s (though Vietnam plays the largest role) to help her convey a
 literature of peace through their and her writings. Kingston writes in a p=
anoply of languages: American, Chinese, poetry, dreams, mythos, song, histo=
ry, hallucination, meditation, tragedy-all are invoked in this complex stre=
am-of-consciousness memoir, which questions repeatedly and intrinsically: W=
hy war? Why not peace? The last war on Iraq and the current one meld here, =
as do wars thousands of years old. Complicated, convoluted, fascinating and=
, in the final section, poignant almost beyond bearability, this work illum=
ines one writer's experience of war and remembrance while elevating a perso=
nal search to a cosmic quest for truth. This is vintage Kingston: agent pro=
vocateur, she once again follows her mother's dictate to "educate the world=
."

David,

I know you've read a great deal of Burroughs and, moreover, are spiritually
and perhaps chemically attuned to his junkie shamanism. I have read less
(but still considerable) Burroughs; what you say about what the cut-ups are
for him rings true, to my reading of him.

Being from the west coast, I have had my share of acquaintance with the poet
and/or artist shaman. It can be quite fascinating, of course, but there is
usually more than a little hokum and queening after the authentic shamanism.

What I proposed in the essay at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/angkorwat about a
kind of quantitative analysis of the semantics of
collage/cut-up/montage/aleatory/algorithmic/verbal/visual/sonic methods does
not evince an ignorance about Burroughs or his methods or even the
motivations for his methods but, instead, takes up a different direction
altogether.

One of the things I expect the shamanistic tradition has advanced is the
idea that we shouldn't be afraid of what we don't understand.

I'm not trying to be a shaman. I'm just trying to explore the possibilities
of writing and art amid the digital. Just trying out a few new things and
seeing where they go.

It wouldn't have been in Burroughs's range to articulate a quantitative
theory as to why cutups of cutups didn't work as well as cutups of his
regular (yes, more intelligable) writing. But, already, simply in doing the
experiment and making the observation, he noted a phenomenon that actually
can be explained in terms of the length between cuts.

Is mathematical knowledge, by its nature, not poetic? I don't think so. Tell
that to Pythagoras.

Dear Mary Kasimor,

You might want to search the archives of June and July when I
solicited ideas for poetry on Iraq. The subject heading was: "Seeking
poetry treating American occupation of Iraq"

For an overview of mostly postwar poetry in this field I recommend
Philip Metres' book _Behind the Lines_ and related website,
http://www.behindthelinespoetry.blogspot.com/ .

Allen Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra" is interesting (in Collected
Poems, 1947-1980).

While reading antiwar poetry I felt a lack of committed activist
poetry against the invasion of Iraq and wrote poems such as "To You
Who Have Been Invaded by America"
(http://interpoetics.blogspot.com/2009/06/to-you-who-have-been-invaded-by-a=
merica.html),
and realized the ideas here were from writings by Gandhi I read when I
was 18 (a hundred years ago). I spotted a similar book recently and
reread it - _Gandhi on Non-Violence: A Selection from the Writings of
Mahatma Gandhi, ed. and with an intro. by Thomas Merton._ I believe
this would be an excellent (and short) book to include in such a
course (by New Directions). The Merton writing in it is also
beautiful, although a bit heavy-handed in reminding himself he is a
Christian.

Depending on your students, you might also see what literature -
including pamphlets - the Friends or the Fellowship of Reconciliation
have on their shelves.

Feel free to back channel me.

Best wishes,

Dean Brink

Mary,

Please check out my website (see below) for some information about my course, "Literature of War and Peace."  I'm very happy you're moving beyond literature of war.  It's so played out as a focus, and can be irresponsible.  After all, literature of war is part of the war culture.

I know you're a little skittish about the poetry.  But let me suggest BEHIND THE LINES: WAR RESISTANCE POETRY ON THE AMERICAN HOMEFRONT SINCE 1941 (2007), an examination of poets and the peace movement.  The introduction and conclusion could be of particular use to you.  Also an anthology which I co-edited, for which I wrote a useful introduction, COME TOGETHER: IMAGINE PEACE (2008).  The intro, which you can read online (it's on Big Bridge), lays out the sort of wider lens of what peace poetry is about.

There are great resources online--and you'll be able to find whole syllabi on the subject, but among the texts typically taught by me and others for an American lit course (though ideally, you'd go global!):

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE by Thoreau
something by Lev Tolstoy ("The Kingdom of God is Within You"?)
DAY BY DAY selected writings of Dorothy Day
DOWN IN MY HEART by William Stafford (about CO's in WWII)
THE TRIAL OF THE CATONSVILLE NINE by Daniel Berrigan
AN ATLAS OF THE DIFFICULT WORLD by Adrienne Rich
other poets, June Jordan, Allen Ginsberg, Muriel Rukeyser, Grace Paley, etc.

Threads, a series of talks curated by Steve Clay and Kyle Schlesinger, is
devoted to the art of the book featuring poets, scholars, artists, and
publishers. The objective for the series is to build on the discourse withi=
n
book arts to explore and enrich relationships between various strands of
book culture that are often approached in isolation, for example poetry and
writing, visual and performing arts, collaboration, design, printing,
independent publishing, literary history, critical theory, and material
culture to name a few. The talks were recorded before a small studio
audience and are available for public consumption on PennSound. Eventually
the series will be collected and published in book form.
=20
Threads began in the spring of 2009 in New York City with talks by Alan
Loney, Charles Alexander, Simon Cutts and Buzz Spector.* Additional
recordings will be added periodically. Special thanks to Danny Snelson and
PennSound for their ongoing support.
=20
The recordings are now available for listening at PennSound:

Thank you for all your great ideas. I have been researching the books, and =

I have been also looking for visual artists who have created art with peace=

materials annotated & edited by CUNY grad students and faculty. Come
tomorrow for wine & free books! The chapbooks will also be available
shortly via http://centerforthehumanitiesgc.org.

The Center for the Humanities
invites you to celebrate the publication of

*The Amiri Baraka/Edward Dorn Correspondence*
*The Kenneth Koch/Frank O=92Hara Letters: Selections*
*Muriel Rukeyser: Darwin & the Writers*
*Philip Whalen=92s Journals: Selections*

Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative

Tuesday December 8th, 2009
6:30 pm
The Skylight Room (9100)
The Graduate Center, CUNY
365 Fifth Avenue at 34th Street
New York City

Introduction
Ammiel Alcalay

Readings and Presentations
Stefania Heim, Claudia Moreno Pisano, Josh Schneiderman, Brian Unger,
special guests David Henderson, Bill Berkson, and others

Books and drinks for all!

Lost & Found is a publication project emerging from archival and
textual scholarship done by students at The Graduate Center, with the
primary focus on writers falling under the rubric of the New American
Poetry. Since accessibility to archival material proposes alternative,
divergent and enriched versions of literary and cultural history, the
Lost & Found initiative takes the New American rubric writ large,
including the affiliated and unaffiliated, precursors and followers.

As a reader and sometimes contributer=2C i'd highly recommend Phillip Metre=
s' blog=2C as well as his fascinating collection of anti-war verse=20
BEHIND THE LINES: WAR RESISTANCE POETRY ON THE AMERICAN HOMEFRONT SINCE 194=
1.

The blog and book both raise many intersting and challenging questions=2C a=
 good deal of which have been for the most part have exiled to a more or le=
ss extent from American poetry today. What does this say about the current =
"atmosphere" of poetry=2C academically supported and otherwise? Is"quietude=
" limited to only one form of "quiet" or ""silence"? Might not the term be =
seen=2C heard and written of in a different comtext from that originally as=
signed to it?

There are some earlier collections from the 1960's which are quite good=3B =
especially i'd recommend Walter Lowenfels' 101 AMERICAN POEMS OF PROTEST--w=
hich has an amazing range among the 101 poems from al periods and "groups" =
of persons in the US--including the famous statements of Vanzetti before hi=
s and Saco's 1927 execution.  The peaceful contributions of American Anarch=
ists are often overlooked=2C except for Patchen perhaps.=20

Another book i'd highly recommend is:

American Protest Literature  With a Foreword by John Stauffer and an Afterw=
ord by Howard Zinn  Edited by Zoe Trodd from Harvard U Press--


From the Declaration of Independence and previous pamphlets to the War in I=
raq this anthology has a really wide breadth of perspectives and writers--a=
 lotof terrific writing in the book=2C which contravenes the usual assumpti=
on that "protest writing is bad writing."

In re some of these questions of "protest/Peace writing is bad writing"  I'=
ve written two review/essays on line re what i consider one of the most sig=
nificant books to emerge from the current wars:=20

Poems from Guant=E1namo: The Detainees Speak  a collection of 22
poems by 17 detainees at the US detention center at Guant=E1namo Bay.
Edited by Marc Falkoff



David-Baptiste Chirot: "Waterboarding & Poetry"
Wordforword #13 Spring 2008
(also has Visual Poetry by chirot)Kaurab Translation Site
Poems from Guant=E1namo
The Detainees Speak
David Baptite Chirot

In these two pieces I write not only of the poems=2C the book and its manne=
r of translation=2C but also of the American reception of the poems in prin=
t=2C radio and email (including this list=2C though without mentioning name=
s) reviews and remarks. As with the generic opinions of protest poems--and/=
or "poems of witness"-- being "bad poems" in formal terms=2C the Guantanamo=
 poems are considered as "failures" as poetry=2C which helps in evading any=
 of the issues associated with the book and its authors and translators. In=
 many ways=2C the poems reveal more about their American readers than about=
 the detainees themselves.=20

An interesting question for our times is why this convention of (and conven=
tional) response is so widespread and expressed in the types of elitist=2C =
formal=2C distanced=2C "complex and ambiguous" terms  which protest protest=
 writing to begin with. It is interesting to me that it is not the War nor =
the government nor practices of torture and illegal detention that are prot=
ested against=2C as it were=2C but that the poems of protest which the war =
has produced are. =20

In this vein i wrote a critique of Chalres Bernstein's "Enough=2C" addresse=
d to the "community" as a call to evade the direct protest poem in favor of=
 a "complex ambiguous" language for dealing with the situation. The piece o=
riginally appeard in galatearesurrection #3 and has been reprinted here and=
 in the UK a few times. The "Poets Against the War are considered inferior =
because they are written in the same language Bush uses--(one might contest=
 this=3B did Bush speak poetically? etc)--that is=2C the poems openly expre=
ss opposition rather than presenting a formally contructed poetic object ma=
king use of a form of New New Criticism:  the "complex=2C" "the ambiguous" =
(seven types of ambiguity perhaps--??)--as response. As Amiri Baraka has re=
marked=2C this perhaps a way of "playing it safe=3B" after all=2C if statem=
ents are ambiguous=2C they might be difficult to "charge with dissent" by e=
ither a prospective employer or this or that group supportive of the wars =
=2C or agency of the government on campus etc.

Unlike the avant-gardes of the past=2C which took the dual militaary meanin=
g of the term seriously=2C today the avant does not openly express either p=
ro-War attitudes (Italian futurism) or anti-War dissent (Dada.) Perhaps=2C =
then=2C what "avant" has come to mean is a removal not only from War itself=
=2C but from the aspects of War which signal an engagment with Peace or act=
ually societies=2C human lives. That is=2C due to the emphasis on the Forma=
l=2C there is a certain evacuation of resistence which might cause one "any=
 trouble." The sense of cautiousness and a form of fear and anxiety=2C echo=
es in many ways the Eisenhower- McCarthy years and hence a connection with =
aspects of the New Criticism of that era=2C which also stressed the Formal =
over direct engagements with the times.=20

This area and conception of poetry in itself might be investigated along si=
de the poems of protest and Peace=2C as another response which the society =
has given to the wars being fought in its name.=20

erature=0A=0AAs a reader and sometimes contributer, i'd highly recommend Ph=
illip Metres' blog, as well as his fascinating collection of anti-war verse=
 =0ABEHIND THE LINES: WAR RESISTANCE POETRY ON THE AMERICAN HOMEFRONT SINCE=
 1941.=0A=0AThe blog and book both raise many intersting and challenging qu=
estions, a good deal of which have been for the most part have exiled to a =
more or less extent from American poetry today. What does this say about th=
e current "atmosphere" of poetry, academically supported and otherwise? Is"=
quietude" limited to only one form of "quiet" or ""silence"? Might not the =
term be seen, heard and written of in a different comtext from that origina=
lly assigned to it?=0A=0AThere are some earlier collections from the 1960's=
 which are quite good; especially i'd recommend Walter Lowenfels' 101 AMERI=
CAN POEMS OF PROTEST--which has an amazing range among the 101 poems from a=
l periods and "groups" of persons in the US--including the famous statement=
s of Vanzetti before his and Saco's 1927 execution.  The peaceful contribut=
ions of American Anarchists are often overlooked, except for Patchen perhap=
s. =0A=0AAnother book i'd highly recommend is:=0A=0AAmerican Protest Litera=
ture  With a Foreword by John Stauffer and an Afterword by Howard Zinn  Edi=
ted by Zoe Trodd from Harvard U Press--=0A=0A=0AFrom the Declaration of Ind=
ependence and previous pamphlets to the War in Iraq this anthology has a re=
ally wide breadth of perspectives and writers--a lotof terrific writing in =
the book, which contravenes the usual assumption that "protest writing is b=
ad writing."=0A=0AIn re some of these questions of "protest/Peace writing i=
s bad writing"  I've written two review/essays on line re what i consider o=
ne of the most significant books to emerge from the current wars: =0A=0APoe=

 17 detainees at the US detention center at Guant=C3=A1namo Bay.=0AEdited b=

ranslation Site=0APoems from Guant=C3=A1namo=0AThe Detainees Speak=0ADavid =
Baptite Chirot=0A=0AIn these two pieces I write not only of the poems, the =
book and its manner of translation, but also of the American reception of t=
he poems in print, radio and email (including this list, though without men=
tioning names) reviews and remarks. As with the generic opinions of protest=
 poems--and/or "poems of witness"-- being "bad poems" in formal terms, the =
Guantanamo poems are considered as "failures" as poetry, which helps in eva=
ding any of the issues associated with the book and its authors and transla=
tors. In many ways, the poems reveal more about their American readers than=
 about the detainees themselves. =0A=0AAn interesting question for our time=
s is why this convention of (and conventional) response is so widespread an=
d expressed in the types of elitist, formal, distanced, "complex and ambigu=
ous" terms  which protest protest writing to begin with. It is interesting =
to me that it is not the War nor the government nor practices of torture an=
d illegal detention that are protested against, as it were, but that the po=
ems of protest which the war has produced are.  =0A=0AIn this vein i wrote =
a critique of Chalres Bernstein's "Enough," addressed to the "community" as=
 a call to evade the direct protest poem in favor of a "complex ambiguous" =
language for dealing with the situation. The piece originally appeard in ga=
latearesurrection #3 and has been reprinted here and in the UK a few times.=
 The "Poets Against the War are considered inferior because they are writte=
n in the same language Bush uses--(one might contest this; did Bush speak p=
oetically? etc)--that is, the poems openly express opposition rather than p=
resenting a formally contructed poetic object making use of a form of New N=
ew Criticism:  the "complex," "the ambiguous" (seven types of ambiguity per=
haps--??)--as response. As Amiri Baraka has remarked, this perhaps a way of=
 "playing it safe;" after all, if statements are ambiguous, they might be d=
ifficult to "charge with dissent" by either a prospective employer or this =
or that group supportive of the wars , or
 agency of the government on campus etc.=0A=0AUnlike the avant-gardes of th=
e past, which took the dual militaary meaning of the term seriously, today =
the avant does not openly express either pro-War attitudes (Italian futuris=
m) or anti-War dissent (Dada.) Perhaps, then, what "avant" has come to mean=
 is a removal not only from War itself, but from the aspects of War which s=
ignal an engagment with Peace or actually societies, human lives. That is, =
due to the emphasis on the Formal, there is a certain evacuation of resiste=
nce which might cause one "any trouble." The sense of cautiousness and a fo=
rm of fear and anxiety, echoes in many ways the Eisenhower- McCarthy years =
and hence a connection with aspects of the New Criticism of that era, which=
 also stressed the Formal over direct engagements with the times. =0A=0AThi=
s area and conception of poetry in itself might be investigated along side =
the poems of protest and Peace, as another response which the society has g=
iven to the wars being fought in its name. =0A=0AFor a great deal more of i=

Hi Mary,
=C2=A0
There is an old hymn "Joy Joy Joy Joy down in my heart," and one of the ver=
ses is about peace:
=C2=A0
I=E2=80=99ve got the peace that passes understanding,
Down in my heart,
Where? Down in my heart!
Where? Down in my heart!
I=E2=80=99ve got the peace that passes understanding,
down in my heart
down in my heart to stay.

enjoy peacefully,
Wallis Leslie

Thank you for all your great ideas. I have been researching the books, and =
many of them sound wonderful for this class.=20

I have been also looking for visual artists who have created art with peace=

Dear Mary,

My book, *We Called the River Red: Poetry from a Violent Homeland* has just
been published by Authors Press, Delhi.

The book is set in Assam in Northeast India, a region of rich indigenous
cultures but also of insurgency, ethnic conflicts and consequent
militarization. It tries to portray how in times of political turbulence and
social upheavals, the individual must understand that love and the agony of
personal loss are not independent of the larger social, historical and
political milieu. The poet's sense of responsibility -- towards her
identity, community and nation -- is reflected in this collection. Leading
up to the point where the personal entity is increasingly fused with the
political identity, it ends with a prayer for peace in times of political
conflicts and social turmoil plaguing the violent homeland.

I am a poet, researcher and media consultant, as well as Assamese literature
editor of *Muse India*, a literary e-journal. I have been addressing issues
of ethnicity, nationalism, migration, displacement, conflicts and
reconciliation in Northeast India through my writings. I blog at
www.jajabori-mon.blogspot.com.

Best
Uddipana

CUE Books | Fall 2009

Capilano University Editions announces two new titles for Fall 2009:

OTHER
Soma Feldmar
6 x 8, 72pp
ISBN 978-0-9810122-7-8
15.00

"Soma Feldmar's Other is a wonderful extended meditation on questions bot=
h
ancient and timely: questions that arise from naming, play, politics, in
the virtual and actual games of life and language, treated with a quick w=
it
that does not exclude feelings for "the other." Some lines dance down the=

page, others embed themselves in great paratactic blocks of language. Thi=
s
is poetry philosophical but never pompous, stylish but never just
fashionable--which is to say, rare!"

- Anselm Hollo


"Through the deft use of sampling and sequencing, imagistic clarity and
stutterstep displacement, Soma Feldmar builds a series of condensed,
refracted parallels to everyday life. Her serial meditations construct a
knowing subject out of the welter of diverse thoughts with sure-footed
assurance. A voice emerges between language and image that is capable of
interrogating both. This is serious play, delightful inquiry, insightful
meditation, intelligent work."

- Barrett Watten

"The intent of this collection is not to announce that something has
arrived or that something has passed, or worse, to put on display a numbe=
r
of "finely wrought" or "best of" curiosities; rather the aim is only to
pause the hyper-accelerated production of Canadian literary culture just
for a second, so we might get a better look at it, and then to move on."

Subject: Peace Literature

As a reader and sometimes contributer, i'd highly recommend Phillip Metres'=
 blog, as well as his fascinating collection of anti-war verse=20
BEHIND THE LINES: WAR RESISTANCE POETRY ON THE AMERICAN HOMEFRONT SINCE 194=
1.

The blog and book both raise many intersting and challenging questions, a g=
ood deal of which have been for the most part have exiled to a more or less=
 extent from American poetry today. What does this say about the current "a=
tmosphere" of poetry, academically supported and otherwise? Is"quietude" li=
mited to only one form of "quiet" or ""silence"? Might not the term be seen=
, heard and written of in a different comtext from that originally assigned=
 to it?

There are some earlier collections from the 1960's which are quite good; es=
pecially i'd recommend Walter Lowenfels' 101 AMERICAN POEMS OF PROTEST--whi=
ch has an amazing range among the 101 poems from al periods and "groups" of=
 persons in the US--including the famous statements of Vanzetti before his =
and Saco's 1927 execution.=C2=A0 The peaceful contributions of American Ana=
rchists are often overlooked, except for Patchen perhaps.=20

Another book i'd highly recommend is:

American Protest Literature=C2=A0 With a Foreword by John Stauffer and an A=
fterword by Howard Zinn=C2=A0 Edited by Zoe Trodd from Harvard U Press--


From the Declaration of Independence and previous pamphlets to the War in I=
raq this anthology has a really wide breadth of perspectives and writers--a=
 lotof terrific writing in the book, which contravenes the usual assumption=
 that "protest writing is bad writing."

In re some of these questions of "protest/Peace writing is bad writing"=C2=
=A0 I've written two review/essays on line re what i consider one of the mo=
st significant books to emerge from the current wars:=20

Poems from Guant=C3=A1namo: The Detainees Speak=C2=A0 a collection of 22
poems by 17 detainees at the US detention center at Guant=C3=A1namo Bay.
Edited by Marc Falkoff



David-Baptiste Chirot: "Waterboarding & Poetry"
Wordforword #13 Spring 2008
(also has Visual Poetry by chirot)Kaurab Translation Site
Poems from Guant=C3=A1namo
The Detainees Speak
David Baptite Chirot

In these two pieces I write not only of the poems, the book and its manner =
of translation, but also of the American reception of the poems in print, r=
adio and email (including this list, though without mentioning names) revie=
ws and remarks. As with the generic opinions of protest poems--and/or "poem=
s of witness"-- being "bad poems" in formal terms, the Guantanamo poems are=
 considered as "failures" as poetry, which helps in evading any of the issu=
es associated with the book and its authors and translators. In many ways, =
the poems reveal more about their American readers than about the detainees=
 themselves.=20

An interesting question for our times is why this convention of (and conven=
tional) response is so widespread and expressed in the types of elitist, fo=
rmal, distanced, "complex and ambiguous" terms=C2=A0 which protest protest =
writing to begin with. It is interesting to me that it is not the War nor t=
he government nor practices of torture and illegal detention that are prote=
sted against, as it were, but that the poems of protest which the war has p=
roduced are.=C2=A0=20

In this vein i wrote a critique of Chalres Bernstein's "Enough," addressed =
to the "community" as a call to evade the direct protest poem in favor of a=
 "complex ambiguous" language for dealing with the situation. The piece ori=
ginally appeard in galatearesurrection #3 and has been reprinted here and i=
n the UK a few times. The "Poets Against the War are considered inferior be=
cause they are written in the same language Bush uses--(one might contest t=
his; did Bush speak poetically? etc)--that is, the poems openly express opp=
osition rather than presenting a formally contructed poetic object making u=
se of a form of New New Criticism:=C2=A0 the "complex," "the ambiguous" (se=
ven types of ambiguity perhaps--??)--as response. As Amiri Baraka has remar=
ked, this perhaps a way of "playing it safe;" after all, if statements are =
ambiguous, they might be difficult to "charge with dissent" by either a pro=
spective employer or this or that group supportive of the wars , or
agency of the government on campus etc.

Unlike the avant-gardes of the past, which took the dual militaary meaning =
of the term seriously, today the avant does not openly express either pro-W=
ar attitudes (Italian futurism) or anti-War dissent (Dada.) Perhaps, then, =
what "avant" has come to mean is a removal not only from War itself, but fr=
om the aspects of War which signal an engagment with Peace or actually soci=
eties, human lives. That is, due to the emphasis on the Formal, there is a =
certain evacuation of resistence which might cause one "any trouble." The s=
ense of cautiousness and a form of fear and anxiety, echoes in many ways th=
e Eisenhower- McCarthy years and hence a connection with aspects of the New=
 Criticism of that era, which also stressed the Formal over direct engageme=
nts with the times.=20

This area and conception of poetry in itself might be investigated along si=
de the poems of protest and Peace, as another response which the society ha=
s given to the wars being fought in its name.=20

Hi,

In just three weeks we'll be putting out our fourth Portable Boog =20
Reader, our annual anthology of New York City poetry, this year =20
featuring a special section of D.C. metro area poetry. The New York =20
City section is a collaborative effort of four editors?Sommer =20
Browning, Joanna Fuhrman, Urayo=E1n Noel, and me, David =20
Kirschenbaum?while Cathy Eisenhower and Maureen Thorson have selected =20
the work for the D.C. metro area section. In all, 72 different poets =20
will be included in our largest issue of the year.

Advertising in the Portable Boog Reader issue of Boog City means you =20
will reach more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press =20
aficionados throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower =20
Manhattan; Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus =20
distribution at Boog City's monthly events, and the annual New Year's =20
Day poetry marathons at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church and =20
The Bowery Poetry Club. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular =20
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is an anthology =20
of poetry, that means it will be held onto much longer by our readers =20
as they read through the poems, many holding onto the issue for future =20
readings.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That =20
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular =20
display ad rates, making the adjusted Small Press Ad Rates:

      * Full Page        $220
      * Half-Page       $130

"Peace" is the last word of Shakespeare's Cymbeline.  That play is really
badass.  Peace is a central theme in it, tho it is difficultly achieved -
the final scene, where all the confusions are resolved and order is brought
out of chaos, is epic.  Tho if your students have trouble with poetry, they
may have trouble with the writing in Cymbeline, which seems intentionally
dense and confusing.  But I think that's the peace play, Shakespeare-wise.

Last lines (which James Joyce really liked):

* *Laud we the gods;
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.  [Exeunt]

...: there must be plenty of native American lore worth a look. I think
the book Black Elk Speaks acts as a vision journal with illustrations
(read it when i was a teen). Vine Deloria Jr. has written extensively
on the contemporary ways that this conflict still endures.

Dear Friends,
=20
The Poetry Project community has sustained and developed this organization
for over forty years and we need your strength and support more than ever.
As some of you know, The Poetry Project=B9s situation with St. Mark=B9s Church
is in the process of changing due to on-going lease negotiations. We
anticipate a substantial rent increase and possible changes in our
programming. We will keep you posted as the facts become clear.
=20
We are very excited to let you know that renowned photographer Kate Simon
has donated twelve different prints featuring William S. Burroughs to assis=
t
us in our fundraising efforts. Simon photographed Burroughs from 1975 until
his death in 1997. You=B9ll recognize some of the photographs as they grace
many of his publications while others have only been printed for this
occasion. Each print is signed by Simon with a description of the scene and
the year taken in her script.
=20
We are offering one Simon print of your choice for the purchase of a Patron
Membership ($1,000 or above) or any donation above $1,000. Believe us when
we say this is a rare opportunity for you to own an original work of art.
For more information email us at info@poetryproject.org or view the images
at our online store at http://poetryproject.bigcartel.com/category/artwork.
=20
Of course, you can also support us by becoming a Member at any level, and
you can do so online here:
http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/become-a-member or send a check to Th=
e
Poetry Project, 131 E. 10th St. New York, NY 10003.
=20
In closing, we hope you=B9ll begin 2010 with us at the 36th Annual New Year=B9s
Day Marathon Reading on Friday, January 1st at 2pm. As you know, this event
is our largest fundraiser and a manifestation of your devotion to the work
we do!=20
=20
Warm Regards.

dear folks, keala is one of my dearest friends, a real radical, native
hawaiian filmmaker.  i don't know why i didn't let you all know that she's
in new york with screenings of her film and q&a afterwards.  this is the
last showing, tonight.  i hope those of you there get a chance to go see
it and meet her.  she showed it last night at the brecht center.  last
chance this time around to see the most honest rendition of the truth
about hawai'i you'll ever see and to get to talk to my brilliant friend!

in addition if any of you hear of a fairly longterm housesit (3-4 months)
in the city, she's wanting to switch gears and get down to writing.  you
can let me know if there is something.  she's been basically homeless all
the time she's been making this movie, living totally from hand to mouth.
she's a treat.  go see it if you can.

if you can't go see the movie (which won best documentary in the Hawaii
International Film Festival last year), go to her website and buy a copy
of the dvd to watch: www.nohohewa.com.  if you're going to use it to show
in your classes, get the school to buy a copy at the school rate.  she's
living on this at the moment.

all best and hope you get to see it, gabe

...Dickinson's slant rhymes, her idiosyncratic grammar and punctuation, her irregular meter, all were regarded more as eccentricities or the failings of an interesting novice than as the innovative experimentations of a literary genius.

Thomas Wentworth HIgginson, preface.

& so it goes, as Vonnegut might add if he were still around.

Subject: Li, a language game

Li, English, a language game invented by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE
(the 2nd greatest undiscovered OuLiPoian writer) on Wednesday, December
9, 2009EV, in wch 2 words' having many meanings in many different
languages
is exploited in order to construct narrative texts using only 2 words
- the meaning being derived by then translating those words' multiple
meanings.

In the case of Li, the only 2 words to be used are Li & Po.  All texts
shd originate w/ a text of the T'ang Dynasty Chinese poet Li Po
(699-762).  In other words, a poem by Li Po (either in the original
language or in translation) is converted as closely as possible to its
original meaning only using the words Li & Po.

Variations on the game are Po, &Ou - wch are explained elsewhere.

THEREFORE, starting w/ a Li Po poem as translated into English by C. H.
Kwock & Vincent McHugh in Anthology of Chinese Literature from early
times to the fourteenth century:

On the Mountain Question and Answer

You ask me:
 =09=09Why do I live
on this green mountain?
 =09I smile

Doesn't Lee Edelmann in Homographesis, essays in gay literary and
cultural theory, also covered this problem (pp42-75 The part for the
(w)hole.)

It does seem that the tripartite racism, sexism, homophobia; serves as a
critical time image of late capitalism. An image in which the dominant
ideas of our ruling class times are the desire for the end of
capitalism. And with the ever lengthening working day in which the
workers are chained to an e-commerce work station or laptop. In Vol 2 of
Capital Marx discusses time as that which is needed for wine to ferment,
which goes sour with the growing length of the working day which is
always finite as the finite limits of a transcendental a-priori
christian god haters.

best, Chris Jones.

Yes, it would be nice if those people were to read James Hogg's
_Confessions of a Justified Sinner_ and find out what's in store for
them. But

(a) This story got extensive coverage this past summer during the John
Ensign sex scandal. It even got into _Doonesbury_. And

(b) How about keeping the focus on poetics?

Which do you consider a more effective simple pause: word spacing or

Are these different from the concept of breath?

Speaking of Poets, which has become one of the top ten shows on CKUW 95.9
FM, is  pleased to announce the line up for January. All are female poets
who have  been associated with the Kootenay School of Writing (KSW). We lead
off on January 3 with Meredith Quartermain followed on January 10 with
Sachiko Murakami, January 17 with Lisa Robertson and ending on January 24
with Catriona Strang. This, of course, leaves January 31 which will be a
surprise. Please join me in a casual conversation with some excellent poets
and some great poetry. If you have any comments regarding the show or a
request for a particular poet to be on, please contact me at
speakingofpoets@gmail.com. Don't forget, CKUW is available on the internet.
The show can be streamed or downloaded should you miss us.

Mimeo Mimeo is a forum for critical and cultural perspectives on artists'
books, typography and the mimeograph revolution. This periodical features
essays, interviews, artifacts, and reflections on the graphic, material and
textual conditions of contemporary poetry and language arts.

Taking our cue from Steve Clay and Rodney Phillips' ground-breaking
sourcebook, A Secret Location on the Lower East Side, we see the mimeograph
as one among many print technologies (letterpress, offset, silk-screen,
photocopies, computers, etc.) that enabled poets, artists and editors to
become independent publishers. As editors, we have no allegiance to any
particular medium or media (tho Mimeo Mimeo is only available in print at
this time). We understand the mimeo revolution as an attitude - a material
and immaterial perspective on the politics of print.

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

Here are pages 43-44 of "The Gateless Gate":

Paragraph headings:

Goddesses, rather than Gods, were shaped into stone...
"Then to his pupil's surprise, he drew a small circle...
Some nights I sense I'm on a ship plying the Arctic...
Last night I dreamed I was trimming a large painting...
What news is the wind whispering to the trees...

Today the forest blends with air metabolized...
From one's first point of view it's a pile of stones...
In his striking essay, Lawrence Barham suggests...

Cover (to begin, or begin again):

Yes, it would be nice if those people were to read James Hogg's _Confessions of a Justified Sinner_ and find out what's in store for them. But

(a) This story got extensive coverage this past summer during the John Ensign sex scandal. It even got into _Doonesbury_. And

(b) How about keeping the focus on poetics?

No reviews for poetry, best, 2009.
The Washington Post no longer remembers...
...it once had a poetry column in Book World.

If poetry were dead, the post would have covered the non-event.
No, poetry  isn't dead, it's offffff the map.

I don't think of either word spacing or a line break as more effective for
the creation of a simple pause per se. I tend to think of a line break more
as the sort of pause with a catch breath and a faint change in tone, spacing
as held breath.

came across this curious artifact in a d.c. used bookstore, a 2009 uncorrected proof of The Sri Lankan Loxodrome by Will Alexander.

i still maintain that W Merwin closed out the 20th century with the most ambitious poem of that centuries late half( at least one written by a U.S. citizen), but Alexander gets things rolling into the new... whatever... rather nicely, adding pen & ink &other visual
blunders.

Ron Padgett once suggested to me that the end of the line is half a pause ... wonder what ellipsis represents beyond omission?

I think a comma where there is not meant to be one.

Pound =E0 la Olson:  " 'the musical phrase,' go by it, boys, rather than by=
,
the metronome. "

I think especially that last comma really creates a simple pause.

Whereas, I think spacing creates a jagged effect - if you use five spaces
instead of one, it has the effect of 'breaking the poem up' on the page -
and if you use enjambment, this is something normal to us.  We read right
through it, it's standard.  Both enjambment and spacing, to me, create a
jaggedness in the poem which my instinct is to try to read over smoothly
(tho with 'awareness' of their 'effects').  But grammar/punctuation is more
entrenched/standardized?  So a comma holds me, back, makes me actually
physically pause in the rhythm of my reading.

KA MATE KA ORA #9 March 2010

After 1956 American poetry, like rock 'n roll, seized centre stage,
not just in the English-speaking world, but right round the globe. The
impact on New Zealand poetry was profound, as it also was in
Australia. That transformation and disjuncture has been noted before.
For some 30 years, from the Beats to the Language poets, the American
poetic moment held sway. Perhaps it was a last manifestation of an
Empire Central on a global scale as the provinces turned up their
faces in wonder.

Now it is time to look back and ask more than, "What was added to
poetry in the Antipodes?" - to ask what was added to American poetry
by these local elaborations. How much was the American poetic moment a
matter of external energies feeding back to U.S cultural scenes? After
the American poetic moment evanesced at about the same time as other
geo-political entrenchments were upheaved in 1989, what remained for
the 'nationalism' of poetries in the Antipodes and North America? What
was the interaction between imagined U.S. poetic liberation and the
actual rise of global and specifically New Zealand and Australian
poetic reinfusions during those 35 years?

For Issue #9, Ka Mate Ka Ora is calling for articles, essays, and
creative considerations which address these questions of Antipodean
interactions with American poetry and the state of national poetic
imaginaries in New Zealand, Australia, and the USA.

i've been exchanging poems with a friend who, apparenlty, is hearing impaired. i wouln't have known if she didn't inform me. at Gall ...sp? U Det, her hearing is considered unreliable. she visualizes words and sounds them ... in a sense, i suppose a line break is one of the ways we internalize words -- if that makes sense. I wonder if Chomsky or any major language theorist has studied the hearing impaired and poetry as a learning tool???

I don't think of either word spacing or a line break as more effective for
the creation of a simple pause per se. I tend to think of a line break more
as the sort of pause with a catch breath and a faint change in tone, spacing
as held breath.

As 'an American' poet, I like the idea, at least, the sound of it, of being=
 called a "pode"!=20
At=A0 least it sounds "seasoned", if not totally "over the hill." The old p=
ode just ain't what (s)he used to be. etc. Anything to give birth to someth=
ing else! Bring it on! But, really, is it helpful to the description of eve=
ry or anything to frame it entirely in 'polar' terms. Unless I am misinterp=
reting the impulse here, I think the cross-fertilizations, arguments and ev=
olutions of any country's poetries with those of others are much more compl=
icated. It's what excites my eye/ear as globally as I can be attentive,=A0 =
This Empire down the tubes - or not entirely - Hopefully this issue address=
es that.=20

Hi all,

I'm trying to write about a really remarkable play, called The Animals
of Omaha. It involves not just multiple voices speaking (as is wont to
happen in Poet's Theatre these days) but also an emphasis on multiple
listeners. Ex. One voice speaking to two people--ones who happen to be
in different times and places.

But what is the term for this multiplication of listening? And that
reception's speaking back?

It has something to do with a writing of the simulacrum...but not
quite, not exactly that...and what terms does one use for the
mobius-like quality. Mobian?

If anyone has any interesting ideas on this please let me know. Maybe
the terms will come from translation theory? Maybe they will be the
same terms as Bakhtin's...I want to recognize his work but also, to
make a slight shift...

Thanks for your help!

Dear friends:
Back in 2006 or 2007, there was a discussion about outsider art on the
list, and someone wrote the following:

"Funny, how it ... makes me think of 14th century German ... iconic
Christian paintings in devotion to and in celebration of various
Biblical allegories. I remember a CAA annual conference in Boston in
which the lecturer showed infra-red (?) slides of the under-painting
(preliminary sketches) for various works. Instead of stiff depictions of
iconic allegorical figures, we were given a very naturalistic view of
the models - men, women and children - drawn from the village around the
school where the works were painted, definitely made to conform to and
please the strictures of the Church. Following the argument here, the
'outsider' art was actually secreted into the interior life of the
'inside' of the Church. I guess we might call these 'under paintings' a
case of ‘insider’ art. Ironically it's taken 6 centuries to bring the
work into view. ... it's definitely of the material world, and not of
allegory made. Somehow brings up the recollection of the story of
prisoners in Quantanamo [sic] making poems on thin strips of the paper
pealed back from paper cups - and passing those strips among each other.
Definitely 'insider' art by 'outsiders.'"

I thought it was Stephen Vincent, in response to a post by
David-Baptiste Chirot, but I can't find it in the archives. Any ideas?
bests, md

A comma to me is, again, a catch breath though one slightly longer than that
allowed by a line break. A dash is a little longer again. Then come your
semicolons and colons (each with a slight tonal difference), and periods are
almost painfully strong. Parentheses change the voice entirely and carry
whatever length of pause that requires. A backtick is a hitch, rather than a
proper pause, since no one really knows what to do with it. I use less
punctuation in my poetry than in my academic prose not because I have
anything against punctuation but because I respect the power of its impact.

Spacing can have a jagged effect if used moderately. If used once or twice
and for fairly short spaces it doesn't quite register that way. If used
excessively then the inverse comes to seem the case: that the poem is
breaking up the white (or other background color) space. The poem becomes an
interruption rather than being interrupted but because we expect, when
looking at a poem, for speech to break silence, this doesn't immediately
strike one as jagged.

In my own poetry/writing, I treated the end of the line as an arbitrary
shape-keeping or slimming focus. I try to stay close to poetry-as-music and
believe, ultimately, that pause or stop or inflection or whatever has to
come from the words, the syllables, the sounds themselves. I don't know. I
think the shape of poetry, this exploded or anorexic thing on the page is a
thing from the past. Some of us rely to heavily on shape, or form, and I
hope, even for myself, to transcend the "look" of poetry.

Think about it, when someone flips through a book and they see a "poem"
(it's not that hard, you know, like "where's wally?") I really don't think
they take it too seriously. Am I just pessimistic? Well, yeah. But that
keeps me conscious of the problems in and of and about poetry. That's my
poetics, dig?

But a poetry that fills a page or redefines this 8.5 by 11 or 6 by 9 gig,
well, this is what we should be striving for. In this case, a reader can
"hear" the difference between prose and poetry. I take Joyce as the example.
I read Ulysses as a long poem. I can hear it composed beyond poetry and
prose, even.

I don't know. I'm not visually oriented. The visual arts freak me out. I'm a
sound geek. I like listening to the difference between wind through oak
leaves and wind through pine needles. Poets write about this. I like to
think about it and write what I hear, not "about" what I hear.

So, please think
about this and
hell, listen.

the end of a line places emphasis on that line as a unit

it isolates that unit, even though temporarily, to emphasis the going
away and coming back of the eye

into and across space to the next unit of words


in doing so a line-break often emphasizes interplay between supposed
intent regarding continuity and discontinuity

it is a major irruption of space

however that space is interpreted is navigable and significant


but whatever else it is it is space

and that space must be recognized as significant


as a maker of music

and the marker of a decision

that in and of itself has and propels meaning making

I ask the question partially because a poet once said my style didn't
breathe enough, although I use line breaks extensively. Another poet
said the number of spaces and empty lines indicates the length of the
pause. I think the best approach to reading others' poems is to pause
wherever there is a comma, line break, word spacing, etc. rather than
employ our own reading habits. I've also listened to poets read their
own work, and their delivery in no way matched the abundance of
spacing on their page. Should the canvas of the page dictate or
interfere with the breath of the poem?

In addition to the ellipsis, I particularly admire the way HD used the em dash.

Subject: polyphonic & heteroglossia: does anyone know the obverse of these terms in listening?

Hi all,

I'm trying to write about a really remarkable play, called The Animals
of Omaha. It involves not just multiple voices speaking (as is wont to
happen in Poet's Theatre these days) but also an emphasis on multiple
listeners. Ex. One voice speaking to two people--ones who happen to be
in different times and places.

But what is the term for this multiplication of listening? And that
reception's speaking back?

It has something to do with a writing of the simulacrum...but not
quite, not exactly that...and what terms does one use for the
mobius-like quality. Mobian?

If anyone has any interesting ideas on this please let me know. Maybe
the terms will come from translation theory? Maybe they will be the
same terms as Bakhtin's...I want to recognize his work but also, to
make a slight shift...

Thanks for your help!

Eireene

Back when? Rothenburg said something about compiling an anthology, an Outsider/poems anthology. I have some connections with the hearing impaired, and know of one (special) poet. Had little luck with the archives, and my computer is schizzy/slow ... any contact info would be appreciated.

Best to email poet_in_hell_files@yahoo.com.

Yes, agree with Murat, David, a wonderful, insightful post.

Funny, how it also makes me think of 14th century German (I believe) iconic
Christian paintings in devotion to and in celebration of various Biblical
allegories. I remember a CAA annual conference in Boston in which the
lecturer showed infra-red (?) slides of the under-painting (preliminary
sketches) for various works. Instead of stiff depictions of iconic
allegorical figures, we =A0were given a very naturalistic view of the model=
s -
men, women and children - drawn from the village around the school where th=
e
works were painted, definitely =A0made to conform to and please the strictu=
res
of the Church.
Following the argument here, the 'outsider' art was actually secreted into
the interior life of the 'inside' of the Church. =A0I guess we might call
these 'under paintings' a case of "insider" art. Ironically it's taken 6
centuries to bring the work into view. =A0I don't know if the work will eve=
r
achieve the attention of Courbet - but it's definitely of the material
world, and not of allegory made.

Somehow brings up the recollection of the story of prisoners in=A0Quantanam=

making poems on thin strips of the paper pealed back from paper cups - and
passing those strips among each other. Definitely 'insider' art by

*The work of heaven or hell: to somehow
become aware of a howling in the motors.*
          -- (Clark Coolidge, *The Crystal Text*, 54)

As the solstice approaches, come in out of the wind and join us to listen to
Clark Coolidge's compelling booklength poem *The Crystal Text*, read aloud
by a dozen local writers.

Readers will include James Yeary, Jesse Morse, Sam Lohmann, Maryrose Larkin,
Rodney Koeneke, Patrick Hartigan, Jen Coleman, Allison Cobb, Joseph
Bradshaw, Meredith Blankinship, & David Abel.

"A colorless quartz crystal sits upon the writer's desk, still and
irreducible as a death's head in St. Jerome's study or Cezanne's studio. But
what would the crystal reveal, if it could speak? How might the issue of its
presence be brought into language? The poet of *The Crystal Text*, by means
of a rare stamina of attention and listening vulnerability, seeks to become
the medium of the crystal's transmissions."


 *I began to rise but I could not leave.*
*Beginning to see, one leaves the world. Taking it*
*up again and again until the sheets are dark.*
*An inlet of the sea sharded with sails. The sun*
*coming up over a blinking multitude, specialty humans*
*provided for this purpose alone. I am the one who*
*stays up to see that they do not leave.*
*Cardboard hinterlands of the drained liquid trace.*
*Grey distances of chimney and low neighborhood.*
*Wet snap.*  (85)


 *As luck would have it the sun was charring*
*the fiberglass tufts in the yard even from such a great distance.*
*A granite shithouse exploded in a cloud of bee odor.*
*The very earth was tacked to my wall, a ball of*
*limpid snails. Glass, blown firm, and then the*
*waterfall in the photograph it reminds me of.*
*Prose does not care about sharps and flats. It*
*continues to accumulate in the straightest of language*
*keys. I put back on my cap, it says. I lost my things
in the race for the car, it says. I am*
*not interested in the language of my past (my trail),*
*it says. It says these things and then loses*
*my interest. Two blanks, curling in the same sun.*  (87)


 *Awakened by a bang*
*or sudden rent of room*
*a collision of the thinking with*
*where the thought is not*
*or negative moon spot*
*or release of the chimney from*
*behind the pie tin, night*
*and left partial, face erased*
*prepositions for furniture*  (115)

I don't think you have to use any punctuation to let a poem breathe -- it's
all in the rhythm of it, its cadence, the flow.  Line breaks and spacing
aren't even essential.

Subject: Re: technique questions

I ask the question partially because a poet once said my style didn't
breathe enough, although I use line breaks extensively. Another poet said
the number of spaces and empty lines indicates the length of the pause. I
think the best approach to reading others' poems is to pause wherever there
is a comma, line break, word spacing, etc. rather than employ our own
reading habits. I've also listened to poets read their own work, and their
delivery in no way matched the abundance of spacing on their page. Should
the canvas of the page dictate or interfere with the breath of the poem?

In addition to the ellipsis, I particularly admire the way HD used the em
dash.

Is this the only way I can now speak, arms
on a board to a dumb stone? The silence
of written words is perhaps correct for this
connection. An off-note to think of oneself
shouting against wall of crystal. Better to breathe
on it, dampening and misting its striations. Best
to be writing (whatever?) here in this book
in its presence. The window glass is but a
gross imitation of the crystal, as speech is of poetry.
As a closed book is the strength of a hand
brought to a perfection. Poetry is the closed voice?

Am surprised no one mentioned the two salient Levertov essays on this subject: "On the Function of the Line" and "Linebreaks, Stanza-Spaces, and the Inner Voice." Both are in New & Selected Essays, published by New Directions.

Also, Olson's Projective Verse is quite relevant here.

John Olson has a thing or two to say about linbreaks in this intelligent review of a book close to my heart: http://seattle.readinglocal.com/archives/2848#more-2848

A comma to me is, again, a catch breath though one slightly longer than that
allowed by a line break. A dash is a little longer again. Then come your
semicolons and colons (each with a slight tonal difference), and periods are
almost painfully strong. Parentheses change the voice entirely and carry
whatever length of pause that requires. A backtick is a hitch, rather than a
proper pause, since no one really knows what to do with it. I use less
punctuation in my poetry than in my academic prose not because I have
anything against punctuation but because I respect the power of its impact.

Spacing can have a jagged effect if used moderately. If used once or twice
and for fairly short spaces it doesn't quite register that way. If used
excessively then the inverse comes to seem the case: that the poem is
breaking up the white (or other background color) space. The poem becomes an
interruption rather than being interrupted but because we expect, when
looking at a poem, for speech to break silence, this doesn't immediately
strike one as jagged.

My point about, the out-of-place comma was simply that it's something, for
me at least, that seems not-normal, therefore it holds me up - literally
gives me pause.

(Had a great 10th-grade English teacher (nicknamed "D minus Decker") who
would take off eleven points out of 100 for a comma splice - it was possible
to get negative scores on vocab homework - so I guess it got drilled into me
that there is a Proper and an Improper way to use commas.  Teaching writing,
it's also something one is especially sensitive to.

Colons, semicolons, 'spatial' spacing, all these seem to me like Normal
things in poetry.  They don't make me hesitate, wait, go backwards.  I
believe the original question was about how to create a "simple pause" -
perhaps I took it literally.

Consider this recent poem by Gabriel Gudding:

http://chax.org/eoagh/issuefive/gudding.html

Good example of a poem that uses Commas to change the ripple of our reading.

Mary Jo,

Many years ago, someone told me that the only reason my poems weren't
unreadably dense was the extent to which I used space. I suspect that what
you've been told isn't about breath per se but, rather, white space, the
visual equivalent of breath whether we choose to let it control how we speak
it or not. We have pretty much been trained to ignore any space to the right
of a poem; that's just expected to be there. If you're poems were indented
or centered or anything but flush left, I think said poet would have read
your work differently.

	IF there were an expat American poetry scene in Cambridge (ENGLAND),

In Association with Subjective Theatre Company=92s Play Reading Series

One Armed Man Presents

FUNDAMENTALISM

By Joel Chace

December 15, 2009 (New York, NY) =96 In association with the producing
Subjective Theatre Company, One Armed Man will be an assisting
co-producer of Joel Chace=92s new play Fundamentalism, which will have a
developmental reading on January 13, 2010 at 7pm at Under St. Marks
(94 St. Marks Place).

In Fundamentalism, a woman picks up a man in a bar for a one night
stand, and she finds an ex-boyfriend =96 and his new lover =96 in her
house. Sexual couplings and triplings ensue, until the man who
stumbled into the free-for-all discovers that the three strangers have
been sent on a highly lucrative mission to derail his life and alter
his perceptions. Artistic director Adam Klasfeld directs the show,
which is a part of Subjective Theatre Company=92s Reading Series.

Featuring: Dan Cozzens, Sarah Koestner, Chris Keogh and Yesim Ak.

The author of more than a dozen print and electronic poetry
collections, Joel Chace=92s play Triptych was presented as a staged
reading produced by Amphibian Productions at Manhattan=92s ArcLight
Theatre in April 2004. Fundamentalism will be his second play to
receive a staged reading. His other plays include To the Thieves and
Decorative Hermits.  As a poet, Chace has been published in 6ix,
Tomorrow, Lost and Found Times, Coracle, xStream, and Jacket. From
BlazeVox Books is Cleaning the Mirror: New and Selected Poems, and
from Paper Kite Press is Matter No Matter, another full-length
collection.  Recently out from Country Valley Press is Scaffold, the
first part of an ongoing poetic sequence, "(b)its," from Meritage
Press, and A Script, from Otoliths Books.  For many years, Chace has
been Poetry Editor for the experimental electronic magazine 5_Trope.

Director Adam Klasfeld wrote and helmed the Mark Twain docudrama The
Report of My Death, which recently premiered aboard the Steamship
Lilac after developmental previews in New Jersey, New Mexico and
Alaska. His drama The Prostitute of Reverie Valley went through
developments at the Flea in Manhattan and the Last Frontier Theatre
Conference in Alaska before premiering at the 2006 New York
International Fringe Festival. His tragicomedy Good Fences Make Good
Neighbors received a chashama AREA Award, and opened to critical
acclaim at the 2005 FringeNYC. He is the artistic director of the
production company One Armed Man, and is also a journalist and
director.

The Subjective Theatre Company is dedicated to producing a wide range
of politically and socially relevant theatre and presenting it at no
cost to the public.  It aspires to create work that consistently
challenges and entertains our audience while inspiring creativity and
social responsibility within our community.

Here's an essay I wrote recently called Art, Games and Play:
http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/perspective.htm

The essay was commissioned by the Centre for International Contemporary Art
in Montréal (CIAC). They do various things which include publishing an
online magazine concerned with "cyberculture, art and literature". The issue
this essay is in is about art games.

It also includes a review I wrote (
http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/compterendu.htm ) on A Philosophy of Computer
Art by Dominic McIver Lopes, and a video interview with him (
http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/entrevue.htm ) I did a few months ago. Lopes's
book is the first one I know of by a philosopher who develops a philosophy
of art in which the computer is crucial as medium. It's kind of a crucial
book to thinking about such art, I think. It makes some basic distinctions
and definitions that need to be made. It certainly isn't the last word on
the matter, but it's a good start.

The reason the CIAC published the review and interview with Lopes is because
Lopes's philosophy of computer art, which stresses the importance of
interactivity, looks at computer games as part of computer art.

This issue of the CIAC's online magazine is at http://www.ciac.ca/magazine

The best in town, the best, the best
The best in town
Not a quack, not a quack, not a waddle or a quack
But a glide and a whistle and a snowy white back
And a head so noble and high . . .
—Frank Loesser

I was honored to join the board of Ugly Duckling Presse near to its
start. It struck me at the time as one of the best small presses I had
ever encountered. Over the years I think that has become apparent to
just about anyone who pays attention to such things – and I know that’s
true of you our there in virtual reality.

Here’s the thing (you’ve heard it before): for Ugly Duckling to survive
and thrive, it needs the financial support of those who share my
commitment to its remarkable and necessary work.

Subscriptions: http://uglyducklingpresse.org/subscriptions.html

UDP has recently announced its 2010 “Full Presse Subscription.” The
editors note that “this is going to be one of the Presse's most
ambitious years yet, with more than 25 titles planned, including new
poetry by emerging and established authors, artist books, works in
translation, new titles in the Lost Literature series, and more.”

UDP’s Full Presse “basic” subscription is a great deal at $150, which
covers the cost of production and postage. Subscriptions are limited to
200 per year, to guarantee that all subscribers receive the hand-made
chapbooks and ephemera in addition to the "regular" books. While the
basic subscription gets the books out, which is the whole point of UDP,
this basic subscription is not a donation. I hope you will consider
becoming a “Supporting Subscriber” ($250) or joining the “Collector’s
Circle” ($1,000). By contributing at one of these levels, you receive
the full subscription package while making a tax-deductible contribution
to the Presse. The editors note that supporting contributors “will be
acknowledged on our donor list and invited to a UDP cocktail reception,
to be held in Spring 2010, a unique opportunity to meet writers,
editors, designers, and board members. Collector's Circle subscribers
will also receive a one-of-a-kind book, written and designed by the UDP
collective, and will be credited in our print catalog.”

UDP also welcomes cash donations
<http://uglyducklingpresse.org/donate.html>, which can be sent via the
link or to the press by mail. All contributors will be added to UDP's
list of supporters.

And hey!: it’s not really an ugly ducking. It’s a swan.

Yours, truly,

Charles Bernstein

Thank you, Elizabeth, and all who've responded.

Mary Jo,

Many years ago, someone told me that the only reason my poems weren't
unreadably dense was the extent to which I used space. I suspect that what
you've been told isn't about breath per se but, rather, white space, the
visual equivalent of breath whether we choose to let it control how we speak
it or not. We have pretty much been trained to ignore any space to the right
of a poem; that's just expected to be there. If you're poems were indented
or centered or anything but flush left, I think said poet would have read
your work differently.

Adam,

If something makes you stop, hesitate, and go backwards, that would seem to
be a bit more than a simple pause, wouldn't it? (If anyone's being too
literal here, it's me.)

Then again, if you use the same symbol in the same idiosyncratic way
repeatedly throughout a long poem or collection, the reader will get used to
it, and the pause will come to be simple or disappear entirely. (I'm basing
this on my own experience reading The Descent of Alette with all its
quotation marks.) I think the key, then, is not to select one way of
injecting a pause as the best but rather to be aware of range of options
that function differently. Anything, not just commas; placed where; you
don't: expect; them can
create
the more complex sort of pause.

Subject: Ou, a language game

Ou, English, a language game invented by tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE
(the 142nd so-so deservedly obscure OuLiPoian writer - who's,
nonetheless, been writing this way since 1968 or 1969) on Friday,
December 11, 2009EV, in wch 3 words' having many meanings in many
different languages is exploited in order to construct texts using ONLY
these 3 words - the meaning being derived by then translating those
words' multiple meanings.

In the case of Ou, the only 3 words to be used are Ou, Li & Po.  There
are various ways of playing this game: As a writer, one can rewrite, in
part or in whole, an OuLiPo (Ouvroir de litt=E9rature potentielle -
Workshop of Potential Literature) work not only using the restriction
of just the 3 words but also using the restriction of the original
work.  EG:

Po-po-po ou, Po' Ou po po po-li-li-po.  Po ou PO li po po po po.  Po po
Ou po po po ou-po po ou po, po po po po-po, po po ou ou-po-po-li? ou po
po Li Po po ou LI; po, OU li PO ou li ou li, li ou po-po ou LI-ou
po-li, po li li po po.

This text is a rewrite of the 1st paragraph of the Gilbert Adair
translation, A Void, of Georges Perec's La Disparition:

"Incurably insomniac, Anton Vowl turns on a light.  According to his
watch it's only 12.20.  With a loud and languorous sigh Vowl sits up,
stuffs a pillow at his back, draws his quilt up around his chin, picks
up his whodunit and idly scans a paragraph or two; but, judging its
plot impossibly difficult to follow in his condition, its vocabulary
too whimsically multisyllabic for comfort, throws it away in disgust."

Note that it contains a mystery regarding the semi-hidden nature of
some of its formal properties & that it also doesn't contain the letter
"e" - either in the use of Ou, Li & Po as its sole vocabulary OR in the
words in its translation.  As such, it uses the restriction of the
original Perec work.

2ndly, a writer can rewrite any work only using these 3 words but w/o
adhering to any other restriction.  3rdly, a writer can write a new
work using only those 3 words.  Following are 2 texts & their 1st
generation translations.  See the description of a possible reader role
following them.

OU

Po PO, OU po li li po li li po po, ou ou po Ou/ou PO po, po ou ou po po
ou po-po ou/ou li po po ou (Li Po po OU "OU" po Li Po po "po-po-po"),
ou li po po ou ou li-po li (po po: po OU po ou-ou li ou po OU po po po
li li).

Translation:

Organizational Unit

In Operational Program, Operational Unit to gush to you what of what it
in where whom in I/you Operational Program indicator of respect, the
whole he comes either according to whether or opposite-yes either/or it
by close whom (Li Po in Operational Unit in-exhange-for-"expenditure
necessarily resulting from the treaty or from acts adopted in
accordance therewith, compulsory expenditure" against Li Po in
Operational Unit "in-exchange-for-according-to-at-the-rate-of"), or to
you an indicator of respect to gush egg and whether-whether it (for in
exchange for: to gush compulsory expenditure for girl-egg to you whom
in exchange for compulsory expenditure according to all along to gush
from a spout them at that place).

Ou Ou

Ou li li li, li li, po po.  PO po po ou ou ou ou po li po ou po!  Po
ou, Ou Ou, ou, po ou, ou!

Translation:

Rotten Egg

He comes to you at that place over there, that hillside, after sunset.
Jump over pole and cloud or at the price of pox on your arse!  For he
comes, Rotten Egg, and, after he comes, WO!

The reader can also play this game by trying to figure out wch of the
specific formal possibilities has determined the result.  EG: in the 2
examples above: Is either derived from a pre-existing text?  Is either
a 'new' work?  The reader can become the writer by creating a rationale
for their interpretation - such as the one presented after the example
derived from Perec above.  This can then be known as "Cure for Po, Li,
Ou" or "Po Po Po, Li, Ou".  Any readers making analytical guesses about
the origins/translations of the above are welcome to submit them to
tENTATIVELY, a cONVENIENCE @: anon@fyi.net in probable exchange for
solutions &/or further problems as well as possible publication.

Variations on the game are Po, &Li - wch are explained elsewhere.

& Orwell is famous for 1 comment, many comments, but ! in particular: "All =
Art is Propaganda." The problem, THE PROBLEM with most poetry, and the reas=
on it's become of little relevance in today's world is simply because most =
poetry is THE PROPAGANDA of the self. We already have 8.7 hundred thousand =
dopey self-help books on thousands of shelves in homes, libraries, and book=
stores across America. & most poetry is exalted language of the SELF. Sure,=
 Whitman sang his famous Song of Myself, but his poems reached out into the=
 naked wilderness of American life in the late 19th century. Not everyone c=
an be a Whitman, Ginsberg, Yeats, Neruda, but it seems that few poets consi=
der the larger world. This has been my main complaint concerning the work o=
f Ashberry. He goes about his business in the Great OUtside, but everything=
 is seen through this cyrptic prism, the Self, & it's as though his main th=
eme is often failed ephiphany (sp?). The world seems to offer him
 some vague revelation, then withholds it. & some readers are forever charm=
ed by this. I often find it annoying, although much of Ashbery is extremely=
 inventive, and fun to read. MEMEMEMEME. The great American theme. & so for=
th/& so ON. At least Ashbery is inventive enough to give us the self as see=
n from circus fun house mirrors. =0A=0A=0A=0A=0A___________________________=

Thanks to James Morris who creates brilliant works on his laptop screen,
and to the people on Cybermind, who, years ago, sent out images of their
desktop screens as a kind of home-sharing. I'm hoping other people might
show their screens as well at this point.

Thanks, Alan

the post Neruda speaks:

from the forward by C.D. Wright:

From the beginning to the end of the Pinochet regime, Zurita's actions,
private and public, have ranged from the horrible to the sublime. He has
performed terrible acts of self-mutilation, branding his face and burning
his eyes with ammonia, but he has also inscribed the sky and the desert
with his poetry. On June 2, 1982, his poem "La vida nueva," which opens

Elizabeth, yes, I was thinking after my last post that the thing about
misplaced commas that pauses me is their variance with my (rather
intransigent) expectations; that if this were to become a standard
convention, the way to achieve pause would be to break, in turn, this
codified way of breaking conventions.  So perhaps the answer to the questio=
n
is that pause, ultimately, is achieved by a constant variance with ways of
pausing that have been established both within and outside one's own work;
then, a variance with the pattern by which one varies, etc.

Tho I think this all smacks of "make it new," which at least some critics
I've read have complained is no longer itself a new imperative and leads to
a superficially novel text.  I think the original sense of "For in that
sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal
coil Must give us pause"

(=85"Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of
resolution Is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought And enterprises o=
f
great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry")

is that we are given-pause by a major idea - not by a shape or a 'device'
(steve), but by a concept so powerful that we can no longer proceed with ou=
r
designs, we must reevaluate everything, maybe even the very notion of
cavaliering forward.
no stops but in ideas!

Dear Jim,

I have listened to your Lopes interview and read your review of his book. I
want to unpack -or react to- one short passage from your review:

"What separates computers from other machines is programmability.
Programmability is what gives computers their radical flexibility, as
machines. Flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably
never will be, that there exist thought processes of which humans are
capable and computers are not. Which is to say that programmability provide=
s
flexibility, very likely, to the point of the dynamic fluidity of thought. =
"

""What separates computers from other machines is programmability.
Programmability is what gives computers their radical flexibility, as
machines."

What happens to this assertion if you replace the word "programmability"
with "virtuality?" After all, the latter is the direct corollary of the
former. One has a conceptual edifice which may disappear like smoke at a
moment's notice; what one has then is -not fragments, nor relics- but a
"program" which may be constant or have its own mysterious cycle of
half-lives. Is this erosion in "substance" peculiar only to computers -the
defining quality of a computer- or is it a reflection of a broader shift in
one's perception of reality. The atom theory of substance is progressively
split into smaller particles -quarks (as in quacks), leptons (as in Lipton)=
,
bosons (as in bisons), neutrinos, muons, tauans, and their antis, etc., etc=
.
- so that we have a conceptual reality can only be grasped by computers, by
the grasp of its algorithms.- The string theory has the feel and image
structure of a fairy tale, with its secret passages, trap doors, strange
animals, mazes, or of the addictive games in a computer? And, finally, the
grand daddy of this kind of language universe, Alice's descent into the
Wonderland (after all, Alice cries "it's all "virtual"). Despite all its
interconnectedness and "universality," the computer, it seems to me, is a
profoundly subjective, even solipsistic medium, continuously built on,
reinforced by one's wishes -fulfillments- ("choices) -a quality touted as
one of its main virtues but in actuality is one of its most subversive
qualities, a Trojan horse against human freedom. Despite its ocean of
"interconnectivity," isn't this why our world consists of archipelagos of
isolation (heard by no one) and narcissism (wanting to hear no one) fightin=
g
each other?

If Mr. Lopes wants to develop a theory of computer art, instead of creating
dainty little defintions fitting together like a Chinese puzzle, he should
tackle these broader issues.

"Flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably never will
be, that there exist thought processes of which humans are capable and
computers are not. Which is to say that programmability provides
flexibility, very likely, to the point of the dynamic fluidity of thought."

If one assumes, as I think you indirectly are doing, that there is no break
between "human" thought and "computer/machine" thought, that they represent
a continuum -that machines also have their "spiritual lives"- then one must
analyze the "otherness," nature of human thought as it "passes"/ travels
into the algorthmic/computer universe/space. It is this absence of a
confrontation with this "otherness" which I find most frustrating in the
nearly Utopian protestations of the computer/digital art enthusiasts. I fin=
d
in them a touch of sentimentality.

Mr. Lopes finds in computer games the essence of computer art. My guess is
that there is a good deal of truth in that. But then then he sees those
games similar to pop entertainment. The truly good ones are much more akin
to fairy tales, full of "real" danger, threat and warnings.

I would like to salute David Chirot's posts (and recommend his work on line=
)
which carry on similar arguments to mine from a different perspective.

Ciao,

Murat

Burt Kimmelman's new book of poems, As If Free (Talisman House, Publishers)=
, is now available from Amazon and SPD / Small Press Distribution (see link=
s below).

About As If Free:

"Make no mistake about it: Burt Kimmelman appears here - & not for the firs=
t time - as a successor to the lineage of William Carlos Williams & George =
Oppen (to name but two), no less so for being a master of that lineage worn=
 proudly.  The sense of number in his writing - particle by particle & brea=
th by breath - & the attention that he gives to other particulars - the lit=
tlest words & the small moments through which we live - are of a piece.  In=
 this there is nothing minor or modest, although it might appear to be just=
 that, but a strict & powerful accounting, leaving me - for one - filled wi=
th admiration & hooked on every word."
- Jerome Rothenberg

About Burt Kimmelman's previous books of poetry:

"Somehow achieves a rare purity. Few contemporary poets so gracefully demon=
strate classic notions of what the practice of poetry must be: Kimmelman's =
work is carefully wrought, with concision, focus, and the rhythm of musical=
 composition. . . .."
- Madeline Tiger, Jacket magazine

"Burt Kimmelman's poems flourish as they pivot from a repertoire of reitera=
ted subjects-works of art, natural landscapes, family, the animal world-to =
a transfiguring notion of their properties and possibilities. For over twen=
ty-five years, this practice has produced dynamic patterns of insight, patt=
erns comprised of recurring figures and forms which nevertheless shift in t=
heir relations to his poetic witness."
- John Curley, Talisman: A Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics

"[The poems'] consistent occasions reinforce each other. We find the arts r=
estate the questions we have been asking and the ways they clean and stretc=
h our questions reward us more than answers would."
- William Bronk

"As quiet an experience as anyone could wish for."
- Cid Corman

"This is a rare evocation of a luminous place indeed-the wonder of this wor=
ld in itself."
- Robert Creeley

"In Burt Kimmelman's poems, form calls deeply to form, as though the works =
of art, the paintings and sculptures of the titles, lifted one to the very =
brim of language where one could speak, not museum notes, but of a life cau=
ght whole."
- Michael Heller

". . . artful, fastidious, learned . . . I am delighted by so much feeling =
for style."
- Alfred Kazin

". . . Kimmelman strives for and often attains 'the simple / lettering stat=
ing / the facts'-his own words."
- Samuel Menashe

"Burt Kimmelman is a poet who obviously admires the clarity of classical Ch=
inese poetry and strives for it in his tight syllabics and in his shifting =
images of light and dark. In doing so, he finds what is luminously transcen=
dent in the routines of everyday life."
- Harvey Shapiro

"[Burt Kimmelman's] poems evince a quality infrequently encountered in cont=
emporary American poetry: modesty, an attentive and forthright modesty. . .=
 . . Modesty in an age of irony is infrequent, rare, i.e., valuable, i.e., =
worth our own best attention. These poems are "worth it."
- John Taggart

Reverberations of radio shows, sound cut-ups, a mouthful of metal, and
(that's right) cats make up just a few of the themes in this month's
installation of textsound. William R. Howe demonstrates how a broken
typewriter can turn out great work, Lindsay Cuff layers sound like she's in
a water-echo-chamber, and Kyle Booten gives us one of the world's most
delightful sounds: a child's laughter. Rodrigo Toscano, Lindsay Cuff, Dale
Sherrard, Kyle Booten, William R. Howe, Best Friends Forever, Brian Ang, and
Adrian Moens are all inside these cyber-walls.

'virtuality' doesn't necessarily have anything to do with computers. we all
have our virtual worlds inside our heads and have had for a very long time.
so what happens to the assertion, if you replace the word "programmability"
with "virtuality" is you have an assertion that is false, murat.

lopes doesn't find the "essence of computer art in computer games". he's a
trained philosopher, so the word 'essence' is one he would use carefully.
you are making a lot of assumptions about his work and about what i think,
and you're generally quite far off base with them. he thinks of computer
games as instances of or examples of computer art. his definition of
computer art, as i mention in the review at
http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/compterendu.htm , is

"An item is a computer art work just in case (1) it's art, (2) it's run on a
computer, (3) it's interactive, and (4) it's interactive because it's run on
a computer" (p. 27)

so it's a theory of interactive computer art. he's trying to get at the
important characteristics of art in which the computer is crucial as medium.
it isn't a book about art that happens to be digital but could as well
appear in print or whatever.

there are works, such as harold cohen's aaron, which lopes discusses in his
book, that are not interactive but actually are works of computer art. so
lopes's definition of computer art is too narrrow to include all works of
computer art. but it's a very good book nonetheless because a clear
philosophy of interactive computer art is valuable. it *is* a theory of a
type of computer art, not a theory of work that isn't necessarily computer
art.

to broaden the definition of 'computer art' to include work such as cohen's
aaron, one needs to look at the role of programming in computer art, because
programmability (not virtuality) is what distinguishes computers from other
machines.

You say

"If one assumes, as I think you indirectly are doing, that there is no break
between "human" thought and "computer/machine" thought, that they represent
a continuum -that machines also have their "spiritual lives"- then one must
analyze the "otherness," nature of human thought as it "passes"/ travels
into the algorthmic/computer universe/space."

I've never met a spirtual machine. Except if you call works of art
'spiritual'. I don't expect to in my lifetime meet a 'spiritual machine'. We
have been evolving on this planet for 2.5 billion years and the universe
itself is apparently only about 15 billion years old. So we've been evolving
over a significant portion of the entire time of the universe's existence.
Computers have a long way to go, even if their 'evolution' is much faster
than ours.

But we can think of the current state as holding all the conditions for the
development of 'thought' in computers. They can make decisions. They can
re-write their own code. They can have 'senses'. They can interpret the
information from their 'senses'. They can construct a world view. They are
language machines. And there is no proof, and probably never will be, that
there exist thought processes of which humans are capable and computers are
not. Machine intelligence would undoubtedly be quite different from human
intelligence because the contexts of our existences are quite different. We
have biological bodies and have evolved in ways quite different from how
computers 'evolve'.

I don't see what is "utopian" about this view, or distopian, for that
matter. I never said they were going to make everything all better, and
neither does Lopes.

What he does say, and I agree with, is that computer art is a new form of
art. By that I don't mean art that happens to be digital but could as well
appear in print or whatever, but art in which the computer is crucial as
medium. This doesn't make it better than other forms of art. It's different.
It has what many people feel are exciting possibilities both by virtue of
its being relatively unexplored and also by virtue of the radical
possibilities computers offer.

I'm happy to see a book written by a philosopher about computer art. It's
quite a different sort of book than the other ones I've read about 'digital
art', 'internet art', 'digital poetry', and so on. He isn't looking for the
social or literary (etc) significance of computer art. He's just looking to
describe what it is. Which is valuable. Just the basics. Just the
fundamentals. There is so much anxiety, wild speculation, ranting and raving
about computers and, to a lesser extent, computer art in society. A book
like this, which just looks at what it is in a basic, clear way is valuable
in such a situation.

Dear Jim,

I have listened to your Lopes interview and read your review of his book. I
want to unpack -or react to- one short passage from your review:

"What separates computers from other machines is programmability.
Programmability is what gives computers their radical flexibility, as
machines. Flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably
never will be, that there exist thought processes of which humans are
capable and computers are not. Which is to say that programmability provides
flexibility, very likely, to the point of the dynamic fluidity of thought. "

""What separates computers from other machines is programmability.
Programmability is what gives computers their radical flexibility, as
machines."

What happens to this assertion if you replace the word "programmability"
with "virtuality?" After all, the latter is the direct corollary of the
former. One has a conceptual edifice which may disappear like smoke at a
moment's notice; what one has then is -not fragments, nor relics- but a
"program" which may be constant or have its own mysterious cycle of
half-lives. Is this erosion in "substance" peculiar only to computers -the
defining quality of a computer- or is it a reflection of a broader shift in
one's perception of reality. The atom theory of substance is progressively
split into smaller particles -quarks (as in quacks), leptons (as in Lipton),
bosons (as in bisons), neutrinos, muons, tauans, and their antis, etc., etc.
- so that we have a conceptual reality can only be grasped by computers, by
the grasp of its algorithms.- The string theory has the feel and image
structure of a fairy tale, with its secret passages, trap doors, strange
animals, mazes, or of the addictive games in a computer? And, finally, the
grand daddy of this kind of language universe, Alice's descent into the
Wonderland (after all, Alice cries "it's all "virtual"). Despite all its
interconnectedness and "universality," the computer, it seems to me, is a
profoundly subjective, even solipsistic medium, continuously built on,
reinforced by one's wishes -fulfillments- ("choices) -a quality touted as
one of its main virtues but in actuality is one of its most subversive
qualities, a Trojan horse against human freedom. Despite its ocean of
"interconnectivity," isn't this why our world consists of archipelagos of
isolation (heard by no one) and narcissism (wanting to hear no one) fighting
each other?

If Mr. Lopes wants to develop a theory of computer art, instead of creating
dainty little defintions fitting together like a Chinese puzzle, he should
tackle these broader issues.

"Flexibility to the point that there is no proof, and probably never will
be, that there exist thought processes of which humans are capable and
computers are not. Which is to say that programmability provides
flexibility, very likely, to the point of the dynamic fluidity of thought."

If one assumes, as I think you indirectly are doing, that there is no break
between "human" thought and "computer/machine" thought, that they represent
a continuum -that machines also have their "spiritual lives"- then one must
analyze the "otherness," nature of human thought as it "passes"/ travels
into the algorthmic/computer universe/space. It is this absence of a
confrontation with this "otherness" which I find most frustrating in the
nearly Utopian protestations of the computer/digital art enthusiasts. I find
in them a touch of sentimentality.

Mr. Lopes finds in computer games the essence of computer art. My guess is
that there is a good deal of truth in that. But then then he sees those
games similar to pop entertainment. The truly good ones are much more akin
to fairy tales, full of "real" danger, threat and warnings.

I would like to salute David Chirot's posts (and recommend his work on line)
which carry on similar arguments to mine from a different perspective.

Ciao,

Murat

New in the continuing series of previews (of) & supplements (to) the
forthcoming Kenning Anthology of Poets Theater: 1945-1985, edited by
Kevin Killian and David Brazil, a few words on one play omitted from the
book, Pedro Pietri's THE MASSES ARE ASSES:
http://www.kenningeditions.com/?p=152

Other posts in the series: on Jack Spicer, Steve Benson, and Fiona
Templeton: see www.kenningeditions.com

You can preorder the anthology by subscription, through direct mailorder
or by credit card, via the website. The book will be released in
mid-January and launched in late January (San Francisco) and early April
(New York City); details on these events very soon!

With new interest in poetry as a performative art, and with prewar
experiments much in mind, the young poets of postwar America infused the
stage with the rhythms and shocks of their poetry. From the
multidisciplinary nexus of Black Mountain, to the Harvard-based
Cambridge Poets Theater, to the West Coast Beats and San Francisco
Renaissance, these energies manifested themselves all at once, and
through the decades have continued to grow and mutate, innovating a form
of writing that defies boundaries of genre. THE KENNING ANTHOLOGY OF
POETS THEATER: 1945-1985 documents the emergence, growth, and varied
fortunes of the form over decades of American literary history, with a
focus on key regional movements. The largest and most comprehensive
anthology of its kind yet assembled, the volume collects classics of
poets theater as well as rarities long out of print and texts from
unpublished manuscripts and archives. It will be an indispensable
reference for students of postwar American poetry and avant-garde theater.

I have a growing interest in Liz Grosz's writings on space and art which
also seems to offer a similar way of thinking. I am concerned that media
arts becomes defined by the categories of technology, but this may be
something else.

Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real Space.
is the book I am thinking of, but have yet to read.
Best wishes, Chris Jones.

I haven't read Liz Grosz.

Concerning your point about media arts becoming defined by categories of
technology, I think there will continue to be interplay between
categorizations by technology and categorizations by other criteria. We
categorize things by different criteria depending on the focus of the
discussion. Categorization by technologies can be useful. So can
categorization by theme or by genre or whatever, depending on the focus of
the discussion.

'Media arts' is strongly related to 'technology arts' because a medium is a
matter of technology, isn't it? A medium is defined by the technologies
involved in the medium, isn't it?

Whereas an art, as opposed to a medium, is a broader thing, and can jump
between/among media and technologies.

The very term 'media arts' suggests two different categorizations of art. By
medium and by art form. And categorization by medium quickly involves, for
the above reason, categorization by technologies.

So it seems to me that the term 'media arts', by its nature, involves
different types of categorization, and these different types of
categorization reflect the ongoing need to think about the roles both of
arts and media/techology in media arts. To be literate in media arts
requires familiarity with both.

People who are not computer literate can barely understand computer art. If
it is interactive, they can't read the interactivity. They would like it to
be a movie or something. But if interactivity is crucial to the piece, then
they're just not going to get it. When interactivity is crucial to a piece,
it's narrativistic. Narrativity is how one thing leads to another.
Interactivity is a way of focussing on one thing and then another. If you
can't engage with the interactivity of a piece in which interactivity is
crucial, you can't experience the central 'narrative' of the piece.

That is a common thing now. But the generation that was born after, say,
2000 (at which point an Internet connection was common in households), will
grow up with a lot of experience of interactivity from an early age via
computer games, mainly. Which will give them the basics of computer literacy
and a sense of the computer as an art and entertainment medium, not just
something for accounting and email. And they will like their art on the
computer and net to be interactive. Not simply because they will want it to
be a game, but because they will have internalized interactivity as a type
of narrativity.

Hi - you write -

"Interactivity" and being "allowed to create one's own meanings" sound
very wonderful until one begins to realize how little room of movement
there is in actuality--how little one realy is "allowed" to act, think,
move in the game or poem that is not already limited by the perimeters set
down by the programmer, the professor the poet--"

- But this just isn't true. Gamers use cheat, social spaces, etc. I'd
suggest looking at Ken Wark's work. I use Second Life (SL) a great deal -
there are ways to even affect the servers, 'cheat' the gamespace, open
portals in it, and so forth; it would take too long to go into this. The
interactivity is also among participants - they're social spaces like any
other. We think of physical reality as 'interactive,' yet we can't change
gravity (you can in SL if you're good enough actually). Before making
judgments about any of this, it would be worthwhile to actually use the
spaces for a while.

I'd forget categories like 'media arts,' 'new media.' A few of us are
calling ourselves 'newer media artists' for the hell of it.

As far as virtuality goes, I've written (and published but who cares) on
this a lot - the body is always already virtual, as Lingis and others
indicate as well. It's inscribed, cultural, not emptied of semiosis. Pain,
obscenity, and arousal break through this (see Dennett), which is some-
thing Kristeva pointed out a long time ago (Revolution in Poetic Lang.).

the dear ole soul. when i'm not suffering severe insomnia, sending ranting emails at all hours, i ponder that precious little gem, the soul. & if all matter, all being, consciousness & non-conscious entities share DNA, then why not a little robot soul. the machine, btw, is tops in the chess world. No-one beats Mr. Robot. Not the current champ from India, not even the great Kasparov. In the early stages of chess vs. man, Kasparov had the upper hand with the machine. No longer. It took maybe no longer than a decade for the machine to figure out chess. & without the machine, I would have given up on the visual arts. Now it's back in play, thanks to the humble but handy PC. How long, I wonder, before Mr. PC or boss Robot becomes poet laurete?

Dear Jim and Murat:

(i never did get to respond to yr last letter re Burrtoughs, Jim--Burroughs does not want to be a shamanistic artist as yo calim; in fact in his writings generally he makes use of old neo colonial imagery to rdicule or doubt the shamans he meets--which at the same timeis a ridiculing, or finding hliarous in a perverse way, the old imagery of colonialism in itself and its perceptions of the Other--)

Murat rasied a very interesting point, which he written with great lucidty and beauty of in someof his recnet poerty--namely, the spirtial lifeof robtos, --as Murat points out, if you beleive that a robot/computer is capableof anything a human is, why then would it not have pershaps its ownform of spirtual life?--In a sense one keeping the robot in a kind of colonial viewof the Other if a spritual life as at least a possiblity is denied.  Remeber--an old way of claiming Canadian-American Indians were not human was that they did not have souls--hence were sub human.

In what ways are the machine-intelligences being perceoived as Other--in Japan they certainly are in ways that they are not in the USA--

I found some thrown away coupter arts magazines lately and thought knowing next to nothing about the gaes inside--found it fascainting to read of the games as a form of art not so much per se but as making use of of forms or in the programming--they stylesof movements of beings involved in the game for example--or the movementsof the background sesnes, senses of speed etc--much of it not al that strange at al to the questionsof pictorial representation since the dawn of time perhaps--

The compueter games do not exist alone, however--they exist as a "package" really--with relted itemsin the comic books fireld, action videos vdieo cartoons etc etc--films, music videos, cds of the music--in every possible form they are packaged--to be able to be sold in as many different ways as possible.

"Interacvitiy" is a kind of "red herring" term--a decoy duck--in the sense that it makes something one does al the time seem mysterious and linkedonly to interfacing with compueters, games, videos etc--

I kept hearing and reading and seeing so much abt this vaunted interactivity that when it dwaned on me what it was it was like finding a dud grenade.  "Interactivity" is very limiting--one has only so much room ot move only so many options--and oneis bascialy being DIRECTED  by the game, its programmers--

Many of theways that reading is written about today are somehwat similar.  One reads repeatedly the phrase "allowing the reader to construct (be interactive with') thier own verisons of the text."  iIn the first place, the "allowed" puts one back iin the Bwana lands--ah! the Great White Hunter-Writer allowing the benighted sub humans to find their own meanings in the writ of the Mighty Ones!

"Interactivity" and being "allowed to create one's own meanings" sound very wonderful until one begins to realize how little room of movement there is in actuality--how little one realy is "allowed" to act, think, move in the game or poem that is not already limited by the perimeters set down by the programmer, the professor the poet--

The question of categories is often really a market driven one--how to name something, categorize it and label it, the easier to sell it--or how best to rebrand basically the samo samo(samo old thing, to be euphemistic--)

Thus tryng to determine waht is a medium (media), art and technology is based very much on what the item in questions is going to be markreted as--an interactivity game, an interactive poem, an interactive machine--
(note media-thechne-art are al very much more closely related than market categories want one to think--)

Children of the near future might be learning to be amzingly interactive with machines, interfaces--but with humans?--Think of the ever more incredible versions of the drones flying over Afghansiatn--in which a person seated at their video screen in Arizona say--is piloting their drone up and into its flight path--target x2 4c--woops! 120 dead ciclians!! But a score!! A strike! the same rush as the interactiviy of the video games--

(For a great documentary on this see the film GENERATION KILL --there's a book of that name also, very good though scary as hell--and verified to me by soliders i know who came back from iraq--or that is, something, some version ofthem returned--a lotof what went their died their --and the bdoy with the destoryed wirings came home--)

As Murat remarked, one can in akind of "gee whiz!!" manner discuss computer games, arts etc--yet this overlooks other functions such as flyiing drones and wiping out villages that are just as "intreactive" andare "allowing the reader/pilot to choose their own versions" at least to some extent--again, the limmiting of the human freedom--

Again, using yourterm "narrative"--who writes the narrative--to what extent is the reader/pilot "allowed" to write it--when interacting with a machine already programmed tobe as little concernied with human wil as possible in bombing rea or game vilages--machines being considered better qualigfied to fit this narrative--

Reading the magazines i found, after all, a great number ofthe video compuetr games arts therein are concerned with extremely violent scenraios--

In a sense,by defining things as "interacitve" "arts" "narratives"--this can aid in keeping questions posed within, again, only a limited field, rather than consider the com-pter games and the actionsof interactivity in a much greater sphere of such machines and usages, such games and arts--that is, these games and arts, interacivities are just as applicable to flying drones as they are to interacting with an "art" scanrio or being alllowed to interact with a "poem scenario" and so have participation inthe making of apoem--just as one participates in the destruction of masses of people in a moment's time--

How aoften ,after al are the arts and cluture linked with the vilence of war, looting, theivery--and toal annihilation, erasure and in some cases the erecting through times of alyered strati of edifices knwon as palimpsests--

dear david

it's true that militaries use a lot of computers and even some computer
games. and a lot of popular computer games are very sympathetically
militaristic. there's a lot of money in selling and making that stuff if you
do it for a big corp. corpses for corps.

computing is just another weapon for militaristic minds. but then so is
print. and television. and radio, the movie house, and so on. i don't think
you'd suggest that these other media are thereby worthless as art, that they
are simply instruments of control and militaristic, consumeristic
brainwashing.

it's worthwhile to present people with intelligent alternatives to such
material in computing. the net is of course big into ecommerce, these days,
and a lot of it looks like a store. very consumeristic. but to identify all
computer art with either the military or consumeristic zeal is mistaken.
there's a lot of the same in other media, but we don't identify them solely
with such things.

interactivity is not simply about directing people and controlling them, but
in taking direction from people. about presenting them with interesting
choices and entertaining choices. or educational choices. or x choices.

some programs, such as word or photoshop or this email program, are called
tools because the direction by the program is simply instrumental. the tools
don't write the doc or do the photo or write the email. the influence of the
tool on the content is only at the person's behest. good tools primarily
take direction rather than give it. but when direction is asked for, good
tools also provide good direction, like a flexible spell checker and so on.

we don't think of these tools as works of art. and, i think, for good
reason. they don't claim to be art but claim to be tools that we use to make
art and other things. we don't call them art any more than we call a
typewriter art. an artist could make art from typewriters, of course, but
that's something else.

some other interactive programs do claim to be works of art. what's the
difference? such programs do influence what you make with them more than
tools do. we can imagine two continuums between computer tools and computer
art. one continuum is the amount and type and quality of direction offered
or imposed. the other is the amount and type and quality of direction taken.

what we look for in interactive computer art is not that it be like word or
photoshop or this email client in the extent to which it takes direction and
the lack of extent to which it gives direction. we're not simply looking to
call tools art. instead, we look for works in which an interesting kind of
dialogue is created between oneself and the program concerning our influence
and its influence on the creation of the piece. the giving and taking of
direction involves not a master-slave relation but a lively dialogue. and
the work that is created is not so much created from a blank tablet, as it
more or less is in word and photoshop and this email client, but is a
permutation/combination/instance of a database of components. so that we
think of the piece we've made with the program as an instance of a larger
set of possibilities, and we like to get a sense of the nature and qualities
of that larger set when we turn to appreciation of the art work. And when we
use the program enough and they all begin to look the same to us, that could
be because we then understand something about the shape of that larger set,
which is important to the appreciation of the work.

when marketing says 'you can make your own', well, that's just a marketing
ploy. if it's simply a tool, you can make your own, but if it's an
interactive work of art, you're exploring the work of art.

mind you, we can also imagine programs that offer such a vast set of
possibilities, yet also offer artistic directions, that the line is blurred
between tool and work of art. it may take a very long time indeed before we
feel that they've all begun to look the same (or sound the same, or read the
same, etc) and that we have fully explored the interactive range of our
influence on the creation of the piece.

merry christmas to you, david, and to all the people on the poetics list.

*'virtuality' doesn't necessarily have anything to do with computers. we all
have our virtual worlds inside our heads and have had for a very long time.
so what happens to the assertion, if you replace the word "programmability"
with "virtuality" is you have an assertion that is false, murat.*

By this argument "programmability" also has existed in the world for a long
time. A novelist prepares a plot scheme, a sonneteer knows he or she has to
use fourteen lines, etc. A form is by your definition a program; but it is
very clear you mean something else by programmability. The same way the
virtuality of a computer is something else from the virtuality of a person's
thoughts. Your analogy (basicly a metaphor) is rhetorically cute, but really
a stretch.

*lopes doesn't find the "essence of computer art in computer games". he's a
trained philosopher, so the word 'essence' is one he would use carefully.
you are making a lot of assumptions about his work and about what i think,
and you're generally quite far off base with them. he thinks of computer
games as instances of or examples of computer art. his definition of
computer art, as i mention in the review at
http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/compterendu.htm , is*

You are right. I was reacting to his words in his interview with you. He is
saying games are one kind of computer art, seguing into and implying by it
that "immersion," total absorption as in a game is a crucial aspect of
computer art.

*"An item is a computer art work just in case (1) it's art, (2) it's run on
a computer, (3) it's interactive, and (4) it's interactive because it's run
on a computer" (p. 27)*

Since the first three of these conditions can either exist outside a
computer (#'s 1 and 3) or can exist without being art (# 2), we are left
with the fourth: computer art is art whose interactivity is dependent on a
computer -a definition very similar to the definition of a computer game,
particularly if one adds the quality of "immersion," which Mr. Lopes seems
to do. It seems to me that he believes games are much nearer to something I
would call essence of computer art than it appears on the surface.

*so it's a theory of interactive computer art. he's trying to get at the
important characteristics of art in which the computer is crucial as medium.
it isn't a book about art that happens to be digital but could as well
appear in print or whatever.
*
Following my argument, one can easily make the statement: computer art is a
kind of computer game. I am pretty sure you would not agree with that
statement. I am less certain about Mr. Lopes. He does imply an similarity
(if not equality or even identity) between games and art created strictly on
a computer. (Interestingly, he sees a continuity between games, chess, or
visual/verbal entertainment, comic books, outside a computer and on.) I
would be be interested in finding Mr. Lopes's reaction to the statement,
"computer art is a kind of computer game." If he disagrees with it, does he
then not need to make the distinction between art and game part of his
definition of computer art. On my part, seeing computer art as a game, more
correctly as play, would be illuminating -a real insight into the
possibilities of computer, similar to seeing poetry as play of language ("I
play at riches  to ease the clamoring for gold." Emily Dickinson).

*there are works, such as harold cohen's aaron, which lopes discusses in his
book, that are not interactive but actually are works of computer art. so
lopes's definition of computer art is too narrrow to include all works of
computer art. but it's a very good book nonetheless because a clear
philosophy of interactive computer art is valuable. it *is* a theory of a
type of computer art, not a theory of work that isn't necessarily computer
art.*

Does Lopes consider harold cohen's work not computer art then? I would be
very interested to see if Lopes accepts your criticism, that his definition
is insufficient, or insists that in his view interactivity -in its
"immersiveness" something similar to a computer game- is integral to
computer art, a quality cohen's work does not possess. If he still insists
on his definition, in my view, his idea becomes more interesting.

*to broaden the definition of 'computer art' to include work such as cohen's
aaron, one needs to look at the role of programming in computer art, because
programmability (not virtuality) is what distinguishes computers from other
machines.*
  We already have gone over this.

*You say*
*
"If one assumes, as I think you indirectly are doing, that there is no break
between "human" thought and "computer/machine" thought, that they represent
a continuum -that machines also have their "spiritual lives"- then one must
analyze the "otherness," nature of human thought as it "passes"/ travels
into the algorthmic/computer universe/space."

*
* I've never met a spirtual machine. Except if you call works of art
'spiritual'. I don't expect to in my lifetime meet a 'spiritual machine'. We
have been evolving on this planet for 2.5 billion years and the universe
itself is apparently only about 15 billion years old. So we've been evolving
over a significant portion of the entire time of the universe's existence.
Computers have a long way to go, even if their 'evolution' is much faster
than ours.*

Underlying your disquisition on time, there is a simple fact. If you are
claiming -and I am accepting your claim- that machines can, potentially at
least, reproduce all human thought -that machines can "think"- then you have
to accept that machines can potentially develop a spirit -"have a spiritual
life".- Unless, you want to claim that the spirit is something different,
separate, ineffable and inviolate, which I don't think you do. You can't
have it both ways. If machines can think (that there is nothing to prove
they can't), then, they can develop a spirit. Some of them may even start
believing in god. In other words, when one is creating, for instance, images
of Anghor Wat in a computer art work, one can not see and accept those
images as flat, manipulated fodder in the hands of the artist's
"imagination" (his or her "spiritual life") but entities that, in/despite
their profound otherness, have their own autonomous "objectivity," their
"spiritual life." In other words, the enlightened openness you show towards
the intellectual capabilities of the computer as machine -I have been aware
of your long admiration for Turing's ideas- you must also show towards the
materials which enter a computer art work.

*But we can think of the current state as holding all the conditions for the
development of 'thought' in computers. They can make decisions. They can
re-write their own code. They can have 'senses'. They can interpret the
information from their 'senses'. They can construct a world view. They are
language machines. And there is no proof, and probably never will be, that
there exist thought processes of which humans are capable and computers are
not. Machine intelligence would undoubtedly be quite different from human
intelligence because the contexts of our existences are quite different. We
have biological bodies and have evolved in ways quite different from how
computers 'evolve'.

*Your sentence, "Machine intelligence would undoubtedly be quite different
from human intelligence because the contexts of our existences are quite
different. We have biological bodies and have evolved in ways quite
different from how computers 'evolve'", seems to contradict what you say in
the previous part of this paragraph. What does "context of our existence"
mean for you? In fact, your approach systematically seems to avoid looking
at this broader "context," focusing basically on the possibilities of the
computer as a machine "to produce (human) art." If you had focused more on
the broader context, our discussions may have taken other turns.

Your distinction between machine and biology is bogus. There is such a thing
as a cyborg (at this moment only in our imagination as a possibility, no
doubt). The argument is the same. The film *Blade Runner* goes beautifully
and deeply into the relationship between the human and his replicant,
revealing that the question (physical, moral, political) of machine
intelligence is at bottom one with the question of otherness, of the human
ability to see, embrace the other. The beauty of *Film Runner* is that the
audience experiences it from the point of view, the "subjectivity," of that
other, his/her/its -the cyborg's- "spiritual life," in terms of its facing
mortality.

(*Blade Runner* was the last great sci-fi movie which did not produce its
special effects digitally even though there are very few, if any, sci-fi
film which can match it in power and the potency of its images. A few months
ago in this list I argued that this was so because the makers of *Blade
Runner* were forced to *choose* the effects that were *necessary*. This
leads to the question if there is something detrimental to the creation of
art in the mechanical fluidity of the computer as a medium. In an interview
the film maker Jean Renoir says that an art form weakens -the term he uses
is "becomes decadent"- to the degree that its medium becomes more efficient,
technically more advanced (one can find the interview in the specials
section of the DVD for the film *The French Cancan*). I made a similar
argument in my book *The Peripheral Space of Photography* where I argue that
some of the most powerful things in 19th century photographs occur because
of the difficulties the early cameras had replicating the image of the
computer, "Intentional or not, the power of [these photographs] has nothing
to do with painting but is integral to the nature and limitations of
photographic medium itself, involving not copying, but the 'perilous and
ambiguous process of reproduction' and the demands the photographic subject
puts on the lens.")
*
I don't see what is "utopian" about this view, or distopian, for that
matter. I never said they were going to make everything all better, and
neither does Lopes.
*
What is "utopian" about it is your naivety that computer art can be
approached solely in its own terms (as simply a product of technical
openings, inventions and possibilities) without reference to the context
within which it exists, how it is affected by the social and moral forces,
political and metaphysical ideas surrounding them and how it reflects, or
fails to do so, those forces.

* What he does say, and I agree with, is that computer art is a new form of
art. By that I don't mean art that happens to be digital but could as well
appear in print or whatever, but art in which the computer is crucial as
medium. This doesn't make it better than other forms of art. It's different.
It has what many people feel are exciting possibilities both by virtue of
its being relatively unexplored and also by virtue of the radical
possibilities computers offer.

*Your definition actually contradicts Lopes's. As long as it is "crucial" in
its production, if computer art can also appear in print or whatever, then a
poem produced on a word processor can also be defined as computer art (that
is exactly the dilemma Lopes is trying to avaid).*

I'm happy to see a book written by a philosopher about computer art. It's
quite a different sort of book than the other ones I've read about 'digital
art', 'internet art', 'digital poetry', and so on. He isn't looking for the
social or literary (etc) significance of computer art. He's just looking to
describe what it is. Which is valuable. Just the basics. Just the
fundamentals. *

Does such "basics" (essence?) really exist? Isn't an art form always, from
its inception, entangled with its context? Interestingly, David in his last
post picks on the "game" like structure of computer art which Lopes observes
(something to do with that art's "basics") and shows the political
ramifications of such an approach.

*There is so much anxiety, wild speculation, ranting and raving about
computers and, to a lesser extent, computer art in society. A book like
this, which just looks at what it is in a basic, clear way is valuable in
such a situation.*

Jim, you should stop offering smelling salts to anyone which doubts the all
consuming efficacy of this medium. After all, the computer is potentially a
medium of absolute control (a potential panoptican) as well as of total
liberation and bounty (a Parisian Arcade).

There is no escaping the fact that MANY OF US who voted for Obama DID
NOT (I repeat) DID NOT vote for the escalation of war!  But we did
UNKNOWINGLY vote for war, fooled by his grade-school vocabulary of
HOPE and CHANGE and BELIEVE, his Coca Cola ad campaign for president.

I for one DID NOT vote for Obama as an individual with an individual
political party, individual religious affiliation, or some other
bureaucratic individual's path to the State or Heaven.  I instead
voted as a human being who HONESTLY believed that Obama would not harm
the people of the world as did Bush.

Part of our war includes the push for "gays in the military" as a
civil rights issue.  I for one DO NOT believe for a second that there
is ANYTHING civil about the United States Military Industrial Complex.
 And I am NOT interested in making the DEADLIEST war machine on Earth
gay friendly!

The most recent posting on Poems & Poetics =
(poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com), the blog/magazine/anthology that I've =
been composing over the last year and a half, is a poem, "Coyote," by =
Hiromi Ito, with an extended commentary by her translator Jeffrey =
Angles.  Ito has emerged over the last twenty-five years as a truly =
major figure in Japanese poetry, although her primary residence since =
1993 has been up the block from us in Encinitas, California.  The =
posting here is in celebration of the publication by Action Books in =
Notre Dame, Indiana, of KILLING KANOKO, the first ample presentation of =
her work in English.   Of this I wrote in tribute: "The appearance of =
this generous and beautifully rendered translation of Hiromi Ito's =
poetry is a significant and memorable event for American letters. For =
Ito is poet of truly international stature, whose work breaks down =
barriers of language and gender, bringing an unprecedented erotic energy =
and eruptions of transgressive and domestic excess into areas of deep =
myth and shamanistic performance. It is a poetry of her world and of our =
worlds as well, the gift of a supremely intelligent and relentlessly =
exuberant mind, situated somewhere between bliss and nightmare. That she =
has now chosen to live among us is a still further cause for =
celebration."  And Anne Waldman from a diffeent vantage: "KILLING KANOKO =
is a powerful, long-overdue collection (in fine translation) of poetry =
from the radical Japanese feminist poet, Hiromi Ito. Her poems =
reverberate with sexual candor, the exigencies and delights of the =
paradoxically restless/rooted female body, and the visceral imagery of =
childbirth leap off the page as performative modal structures--fierce, =
witty, and vibrant.  Hiromi Ito is a true sister of the Beats."

No, not a crucial part. His definition of computer art stresses
interactivity. Doesn't say anything about immersion.

No, he doesn't. There's lots of interactive art that is not a game.

Have a look at http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/perspective.htm , if you like,
for relations between art and game.

His definition of computer art does not include this sort of work, ie,
non-interactive work. But he discusses Cohen's work in his book as computer
art.

Yes, but are you any clearer on it? All computers are programmable. That's
what makes them computers. Your term 'virtuality' is vague.

Machines will probably be developed that 'think'. And are as complex (or
more) as we are in their cognitive capacities. And, yes, at that point--or
even sooner (cats and dogs and other animals are surely 'spiritual
creatures' as well)--we will need to provide them status as sentient beings.
But, Murat, that day is not here yet. Programming is not there yet. Or I
haven't seen any indication of it, in any case.

On my site, I have made various works I call 'animisms', defined as kinetic
poetry with soul.  That is mostly 'soul' as in 'lively'. The life of art is
in liveliness, not 'artificial life' or 'artificial intelligence'. Lively
art engages our own liveliness.

Concerning the use of art work, I realize it's problematical to be using
images from the Internet in dbCinema works. The whole issues of
appropriation and intellectual property. I try to respect the images I use
by creating good art with them. But, also, the concept of dbCinema as a
langu(im)age processor and graphic synthesizer, a program where you type
stuff in and it gets turned into images (via google image search) and then
painterly cinema of those images, was just too tantalizing to me to resist.
I am a moth to the light, on that one. Working with these global databases
of images tied to language queries is just too good to resist, to me. As
material for new art.

There seems to be quite a bit of agreement, Murat, about the idea that
should machine 'consciousness' arise, as it likely will, that these
intelligences will likely be quite different from our own. At first they
might not have, for instance, bodies. That would be a significant difference
in the context of their existence versus ours. My body tells me what to
think all the time. And our bodies are of course crucial in how we come to
see ourselves and the world. There are other things, of course, that inform
how we come to see ourselves and the world. Other people, mostly. And
culture. And so on.

I doubt that the most interesting route to machine consciousness is to try
to replicate human concsiousness. Instead, certain properties of human
consciousness will be retained and be at the core of it, but other
properties will be discarded as just not germane to the task (given the
differences in context of existence) or even too hard or vague to replicate.
And other properties will emerge from the programming that we may not have.

I like Blade Runner also. Maybe cyborgs will have bodies like ours. I
certainly don't know. That is further away than machine intelligence.

Well, again, I don't agree. As software and hardware tools for art evolve,
it gets easier to produce a lot of crap. And there will be and already is
lots. In every art. But real artists are able to engage our liveliness.
Producing the same old stuff doesn't. Producing unnecessary work doesn't.
The sense to follow one's own vision will not evaporate from the world with
the invention of better tools. The tools will inform vision and sense, just
as language does (language is a technology), but we all aren't mesmerized by
buttons.

I don't think I do that. Simply because my work does not often deal with the
military use of computers as weaponry does not mean it's without relation to
such an issue.

I try to create strong computer art. My work should be studied by student
programmers as well as arts students. My work takes the art of programming
to a different level. Student programmers need to know how programming is an
art, not simply something for making business and military widgets. My work
shows that, as programmers, we can aspire to the creation of strong art. And
with that go certain atmospheres and notions of what's important. My work
shows programmers can aspire to the creation of beautiful and good things
for the world. Of course I am not alone in this. The existence of such work
is important. Among other things, it helps people tell the difference.

Would you have preferred Kandinsky to paint war pictures? I pursue art with
all the strength and imagination at my disposal. If you don't like it, too
bad.

Read Lopes's book, Murat. You might see it differently if you actually read

This is my Christmas present to you and my news of now. If you ask how it is
for me, I can only answer with this. It is my pome for a new Vancouver of
the mind. Soon I shall be o'ercome with Olympic music and stupifying acts of
heroism in Vancouver. This is my respite already from the madness. My
Vancouver of the mind. Your Vancouver of your mind. Your Vancouver of
Google. Let us share hallucinations. Happy new year and wishes of many
upcoming real realizations to you.

*******************
CITY OF THE MIND
*******************

dbCinema is a langu(im)age processor and graphic synthesizer. Install
Shockwave first from http://vispo.com/sw if you haven't already. Mac users
need to use Firefox.

VANCOUVER
http://tinyurl.com/yae64lz

In dbCinema, synthesis is an act of the mind working at the suggestion of an
unusual form of collage. Language to image to multi-perspectival cinema. A
visual word processor/dictionary exploring the meaning of "Vancouver" via
Google image search and cross-breeding with generative art. Slideshow run
amok to slidvid, dbCinemation. The mind, of its own accord, creates a new
Vancouver made of current Vancouver. In this graphic synthesizer, you are
the synthesizer. For synthesis is an act of the mind, not simply the
technology. dbCinema collages. The mind synthesizes.

In 'Vancouver', dbCinema collages with dynamic opacity in a star-shaped
'brush' moving randomly around the screen. The pictures seem to blend
together to make new scenes that don't exist, and those new scenes are what
is created in the act of the mind. It is not so much a futuristic Vancouver
as a multi-perspectival interpenetration of things we've seen about and of
Vancouver.

It is for people who enjoy synthetic acts of the mind and tricks of the eye.
Tricks of the eye are mostly tricks of the mind. dbCinema has no real tricks
to it. It just mindlessly collages in ways that present images to us that
readily trigger multi-perspectival synthesis in the mind. That synthesis is
the real trip of this piece. It's DIY, in that sense. Imagination and
synthesis required. Create this city as you will in your own mind.

It's sometimes remarked that computer art too often feels enclosing,
truncated in its possibilities and in its artistic range and quality. I
think the main thing is to trigger imagination and synthesis, thought,
reflection, creativity, joy, wonder, analysis, perceptual perspecuity on
multiple perspectives, langu(im)agical textations, dbCinemations, and
hallucinatory realizations.

Click the canvas when you want it to do something else. But give it at least
a couple of minutes first (or longer) just as-is without clicking.

Anne Carson has a great essay on gender and boundaries in ancient Greece, =
"Putting Her in Her Place: Women, Dirt, and Desire" in Before Sexuality: =
The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World, eds. =
David M. Halperin, John J. Winkler, and Froma Zeitlin (Princeton UP 1990). =
 It has been my touchstone in terms of understanding gendered subtexts to =
evaluative terms, e.g., hard, soft, tight, loose, even rigorous.  =
Basically. the Greeks understood men as hard, tightly bounded, and I think =
hot, and attributed positive connotations to these, to some extent =
physically based, attributes.  Women were understood as soft, oozing, and =
cold, and these attributes were understood as inherently negative and also =
threatening to the hard/tightly bounded masculine state.  Women could make =
men *too* hot, spill over, etc.
Gender is the obvious subtext text of Adam Fieled's essay (if subtext can =
blare), and as soon as I started it I hoped he would get to it but he =
never did.
Obviously the essay demands a candid definition of terms.  Otherwise, =
we're encouraged to slip towards the old Greek residues of what hard and =
soft mean, without consciousness, assessment, argument, or examination.

Fieled's words are familiar to anyone who went through the burgeoning
"creative writing" discipline in the 1970s as an undergraduate. It was a
discourse that had nothing to do with quality of writing but rather if
you were "tough enough" to take  harsh criticism you could be in the
club. Needless to say, the teachers were men and the not-tough-enough
students were usually women.  And moreover, the work itself had to be
"hard," not hard as in difficult, but hard as in "not sentimental,"
etc., you get the picture.  Transparently gendered.

Dear all (with apologies for x-posting):
Has anyone had any luck with getting permission to cite John Wieners
material since his death? Apparently his estate is in legal limbo and
Godine believes that it does not have the right to grant permission, nor
does anyone else except for the largely indifferent family. Any advice?

Thanks for this sensible observation, Mairead.

I did have trouble following the imagery, although it might have been
because I got the giggles. Am I to take it that those big hard macho
"masters" keep screwing their submissive "slaves" to keep them "soft",
guaranteeing distressing incontinence all round?

But where do those hard masters come from, then, if all those
upandcoming submissive slave-poets are pounded into softness by their
masters' hard phalluses? Parthonogenesis? (I thought that was an
aspect of femaleness). Or are those impressively adamantine masters
just immortal and forever? Or do the screwed become the screwers at
some indefinable point, like baby crayfish getting new shells? Or
what?

I was also curious about the source for this statistic: "Liberal
poets, I have found, are 30% more genuinely liberal than conservative
poets, and 70% as pigheaded, domineering, and coercive."

Gracious.

Sorry. It's too easy to keep shooting fish in a bucket, and I'm at a
loose end. Fwiw, I am all for rigorous (which is not a synonym for
negative) criticism, as a reader and writer, and have been as critical
of the puff-review culture as anyone. Which is probably why I'm more
likely to found in the theatre these days.

Jeffrey,

Thanks for this link. Of course, Adam is right in his assertion that there needs to be more real criticism in the literary community. But his essay is riddled with weak language and abstractions. While I don't expect scientific data, the notion that 70% of liberal poets are "pigheaded" offers no substance whatsoever. The difference between "hardness" and "softness" isn't any more clear.

Similarly, he discusses the notion of poetry "success" without giving the reader a sense of how he defines that. Is it publication? Awards? Or something less tangible (& less timely) like being read 100 years after one's death, a skillful use of language, or innovation. (He could cite examples of those poets he feels are successful.)

Finally, along the same lines, I reject the notion that we should either understand what he means by "teeth, bite and guts" or expect something equally abstract, which he refers to in the pejorative as "academic." What are concrete examples of teeth, bite and guts? Certainly this essay, based on such an interesting premise, fails the criteria it claims to require.

Feliz Ano.

I'm not anymore in favor of Obama's plans to escalate the war in
Afghanistan than you seem to be, but to say that Obama somehow ran as
a secret warmonger is simply a sign that you weren't paying attention
to what Obama was repeatedly and consistently saying in his foreign
policy speeches.

While he was still a Senator, Obama gave several speeches and co-
sponsored legislation in support of the Afghanistan war. While he was
running for the Democratic nomination and while he was running for
president, every time he spoke about foreign policy, he made clear
distinctions between the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was just as
clear that he would focus on winning the war in Afghanistan. Look up
his foreign policy speeches, it's all there.

It's not Obama's fault if voters simply assumed that because he was
generally running as a liberal that he a pacifist or against the wars
in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He was very clear about his position on
the war in Afghanistan.

Bests,

Herb

Dear Jeffrey in my attempt to not be cynical I voted for Obama.  I now
truly feel STRAPPED to those 30,000 guns headed across the ocean.
This is personal now.  It's mine.  It belongs to everyone who wanted
peace and voted for him.  It belongs to the Nobel Prize committee as
well (I TRULY WISH that they had found the courage to take it back
from him).  Obama is just another war president now.  And I have voted
for the last time in a presidential election.  Let the voters taste
the blood without me.

The most consistent argument against me though for my petition "gays
against gays in the military" is that I'm not thinking about jobs for
the poor.  Oh yes I have been thinking about that, coming from a
military family, being THE ONLY grandchild of who has not joined a
branch of the service at some point.  I'm being interviewed later
today by Flash News by a reporter who saw the petition, and I've
prepared the following statement as I'm sure the argument for jobs
will once again be used:




GAYS IN THE MILITARY IS A CLASS ISSUE?  I AGREE, BUT IN A VERY
DIFFERENT WAY THAN MOST


"Gays in the military" is about jobs for poorer gays and lesbians?
War is a scourge upon the poor, no matter which side of the
battlefield.  If you are on the side that is winning you're being used
as fodder to win, your very life expendable, while the rich and their
children wait for you to do their dirty work.

Nothing but misery awaits the poor on both sides.  In the end saying
that "gays in the military" is defending the rights of poor,
disadvantaged gays and lesbians is actually defending centuries of
belief that only the lives of the rich are worth living, worth
educating, and kept from harm.  By saying you are protecting the poor
in this issue you are upholding the rich and their deplorable way of
life by either making the poor defend their kingdom or invade and
plunder another.

I am nothing but suspicious of the class values of anyone who uses the
argument that supporting "gays in the military" is about protecting
jobs for the poor.

I am a gay man who is not interested in the LGBT and queer community
assimilating into the larger mainstream culture and its structures of
brutality.  I want the LGBT and queer community to say we are better
than that, and will lead by example rather than following blindly and
passively.  I want us to say that we will nurture our poor with aid
when they are hungry and homeless, and provide scholarships for GED's
and higher education.  I want us to say we are breaking from the ranks
of the food chain of war and poverty.

To be frank I NEVER FINISH A BOOK if I don't like it.  And I believe
most people do the same, even reviewers, so I wonder if the reviewer
who has not finished a book deserves to review it at all?

Especially for poetry.  I say this because sometimes I read a couple
poems that BLOW MY MIND in a book, but don't care for the rest of the
poems.  If there are a few poems, even ONE POEM getting me excited
about poetry and spurring me into that marvelous place only poetry can
make for me, then I feel it's my duty to give that book 5 out of 5
stars.  But then I only review books on Goodreads, as I'm not a
scholar or a critic, I'm a poet.  I use Goodreads as a way of shouting
out for the poetry I love.

Let judging the whole book be left for the novelists.  I don't read
novels and don't care,
CAConrad

Subject:      Los Angeles Poetry PDFs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I've been posting a series of scans of poetry books from Los Angeles =
over the past century. Most of these are long out of print, or by =
authors that don't have national (or even local) reputations. All of =
this is part of a research project I'm working on of avant-garde or =
experimental (or just unusual) poetic practice here in Los Angeles. An =
introduction to this project can be found on my blog:

http://www.arras.net/fscIII/?p=3D530

And these pages have links to the PDFs themselves:

http://www.arras.net/fscIII/?p=3D681
http://www.arras.net/fscIII/?p=3D744

Here are the very brief introductions to the PDFs that appear on the =
blog:


Los Angeles Poetry I
(Villiers Publications Ltd., London: 1958)
Edited by James Boyer May, Thomas McGrath and Peter Yates.=20

This is the representative collection by what I loosely call the HUAC =
generation - both McGrath and Edwin Rolfe (who doesn't appear here) were =
either fired or blacklisted due to their political views, and others in =
the collection were affected by McCarthy-era madness. An interesting =
study and anthology of this group of poets (though not including the =
avant-garde or non-political ones) is Poets of the Non-Existent City: =
Los Angeles in the McCarthy Era, by Estelle Gershgoren Novak.

Included in this collection is a weird, Joycean poem by the eccentric =
Philadelphia writer Gil Orlovitz (who frequented Hollywood as an a =
screenwriter; CA Conrad is a big fan, and you can read about him on =
Conrad's blog), poems by surreal, experimental photographer Edmund =
Teske, a large slab of McGrath's Letter to an Imaginary Friend devoted =
to the pleasures of sex, early work by the well-known poet and teacher =
Ann Stanford, and spare, compelling work by Josephine Ain, who doesn't =
seem to have written much but whose name appears frequently in the =
literature on the period.=20

Other poets include: Melissa Blake, Guy Daniels, Gene Frumkin, Sid =
Gershgoren, Stanley Kiesel, Bert Meyers, William Pillin, Lawrence P. =
Spingam, Zack Walsh, Mel Weisburd, Peter Yates, Curtis Zahn - I don't =
know much about these poets except that Bert Meyers has a collected =
poems titled In a Dybbuk's Raincoat.=20

This anthology is a testament to the impact of the Thomas McGrath, who =
lived here for ten years, on the Los Angeles poetry world, since nothing =
of comparable scope was published for a few decades.=20


James Boyer May, Selected Poems 1950-1955
(Inferno Press: San Francisco, 1955)

I'm quite mystified by James Boyer May. He's best known as the editor of =
Trace, a small press journal that reviewed and charted the progress of =
small press journals worldwide. A chapter of the book Mavericks: Nine =
Independent Publishers is devoted to him (along with the likes of James =
McLaughlin and John Martin), though I haven't read it yet.=20

The idiom in these poems is unlike anything I've come across in American =
poetry, though it does have a strange resemblance to certain British =
poets such as those associated with "Cambridge" writing - a high tone =
that is open to vulgarities, a careful, tradition-wary metrical =
precision, a moral earnestness, a syntactic and lexicographical density, =
even a tendency toward Hopkins-esque word-clusters - though May was born =
and raised in Los Angeles. "Incredibly, ideals of bomb-feared noons - / =
here, violent blooms should scintillate, / men supplicate annihilative =
plans." (from "Ossia").=20

May, due to his connection with Villiers (see above), helped Ginsberg =
publish the first edition of Howl in the UK, which in turn led to the =
books being confiscated in mail on the way back.=20


John Thomas, Epopoeia and The Decay of Satire
(The Red Hill Press: Los Angeles & Fairfax, 1976)

Now here's a difficult case: an undeniably excellent poet who died in =
prison, serving a sentence for having molested his daughter; a poet =
whose early work seems to show a visionary breadth and bounding =
imagination, but who barely published any new poems (or republished, =
times over, older poems) during the latter part of his life; and a poet =
Charles Bukowski called "the best unread poet in America" whose style =
synthesized elements of the most opaque of Olson's Maximus poems or the =
collage aesthetic of the Tennis Court Oath (but who was also, at times, =
sexually frank, morally unambiguous in his amorality, and could tell a =
good story, like a West Venice West Georges Battaille).=20

Outside of this small group (most of which also appear in his first =
collection, called John Thomas), Thomas published a chapbook of poems =
called Nevertheless in 1990, and contributed to the excellent volume =
Abandoned Latitudes (with Paul Vangelisti and Robert Crosson) in 1983. A =
good, if not probing, obituary was published in the UK Independent; a =
much more detailed, and harrowing, account of his personality by his =
daughter, Gabrielle Idlet, appeared a little later in the LA Weekly.=20


Michelle T. Clinton, High Blood /Pressure
(West End Press: Los Angeles, 1986)

I don't know much about Michelle T. Clinton - there's almost nothing on =
the internet about her - except that she doesn't live in Los Angeles =
anymore, and that she has a second volume of poetry, Good Sense & The =
Faithless, also from West End Press (1994). She's also recorded a spoken =
word cassette called "Black Angeles" (1988) with Wanda Coleman, who =
writes that Clinton's poems are "exorcisms - the rootings out of racism =
and sexism."

I thought of her as a sort of female Etheridge Knight at first, as some =
of the poems reminded me of Knight's "Hard Rock Returns To Prison From =
The Hospital For The Criminal Insane," with its anecdotal focus on the =
most hidden parts of society, occasional use of Black English, and =
somewhat nihilistic underlying bphilosophy. But Clinton's poetry is far =
more interesting - less "literary" (following through on that distrust =
of the "literary" that runs through much of Los Angeles poetry) though =
formally quite precise and refined. These poems, unsettling as they can =
be (and funny also) are packed with an amazing energy, frankness and =
skill, not to mention searing anger.


Bob Flanagan and David Trinidad, A Taste of Honey
(Cold Calm Press: Los Angeles, 1990)

Bob Flanagan is best known as a performance artist, cystic fibrosis =
sufferer, and subject of the documentary Sick: The Life & Death of Bob =
Flanagan, Supermasochist (view his Super Cystic Fibrosis Song for a =
taste of that). David Trinidad is best known as David Trinidad, =
well-known New York poet. But in their younger years they were hanging =
out at Beyond Baroque with Dennis Cooper, Amy Gerstler and the teenaged =
Kim Rosenfield and publishing with Cooper's press Little Caesar (follow =
the link for full issues).

This is a really enjoyable little volume - 12 poems of 36 lines each, =
and in iambic pentameter! It has some bof the crazed feel of the =
Berrigan/Padgett collaborations but with a distinctly LA setting. The =
formal constraint gets you trying to read the poems as monologues (in =
the manner of, say, Browning), and brings them to a level that Flanagan, =
in his short, difficult life, was able to achieve in his solo poems (but =
more on that later).

The cover image, a combined portrait of the two authors, looks a little =
to me like David Carradine.


Bob Flanagan, The Kid is the Man
(Bomb Shelter Press, 1978)

Early poems by an artist better known for his extremely masochistic =
performance work, written around the time when he was hanging out at =
Beyond Baroque with the Little Caesar crowd. I posted a later =
collaboration of Flanagan and David Trinidad, A Taste of Honey, =
elsewhere on this blog.


Abandoned Latitudes, by Robert Crosson, John Thomas and Paul Vangelisti
(Red Hill Press, 1983)

This is a very excellent and various collection of writing by the three =
authors. Crosson is an under-appreciated Los Angeles poet who writes in =
a sort of fictional quilt style, which is to say, it is very much =
"collage" work but based on his own skewed narrative imagination. =
Selections of his Daybooks were recently published by Otis =
Books/Seismicity Editions.

Paul Vangelisti, of course, was the editor of Invisible City, an =
important journal of poetry from the seventies and eighties (among other =
several other excellent editing and translation ventures before and =
since) and is a prolific poet whose selected poems, Embarrassment of =
Survival, appeared in 2001. Here is an interesting video of his recent =
interview with Ezra Pound's daughter, Mary de Rachewiltz.

I posted a collection of John Thomas's poetry elsewhere in this blog. =
This "unfinished" prose sequence is by turns beautiful and harrowing, =
sounding at times like Bruce Chatwin's In Patagonia and George =
Bataille's The Story of the Eye. It also reminds me a bit of that Jack =
Nicholson movie Five Easy Pieces, though I don't know why - I guess I =
keep expecting Toni Basil to appear suddenly in it.


William J. Margolis, The Anteroom of Hell
(Inferno Press, 1957)

These poems can seem, at times, like a parody of typical "Beat" poetry =
of the time; as the title of the book suggests, it is full of visionary, =
stream-of-consciousness condemnations of conformity and modern life, as =
well as lofty, faintly archaic paeans to love. There's more than a bit =
of Gregory Corso and Arthur Rimbaud traipsing around these pages, though =
without the humor; Jim Morrison probably read this as a teen.=20

It's actually a pretty enjoyable read, especially given the historical =
context, as the author was a key figure in the Venice West scene and a =
occasional collaborator with Wallace Berman on Semina. The book itself =
is a beautifully printed, which might come through in the .pdf, or not.=20


Guy de Cointet, A Few Drawings
(1975)

I posted a video of Guy de Cointet's theater on Youtube. There are =
actually several great resources about this French-born Los Angeles =
artist on the web, such as here and here and here and here, as well as a =
cache of .pdf reprints of various essays and reviews about his work. I =
also posted a photo and brief intro to his work elsewhere.=20

This collection of "drawings," which are really more like concrete or =
visual poems and are quite hilarious, confirms for me the rightness of =
calling de Cointet a "poet" (even if, in this time of conceptual =
literature, I hardly have to break a sweat to make that argument). A =
full list of his compelling, but extremely expensive to procure, =
publications can be seen here.=20


Dennis Cooper, The Missing Men
(Am Here Books/Immediate Editions, 1981)

A really beautiful, simply but elegantly produced collection of early =
poems and very short fictions by the well-known author Dennis Cooper. =
Cooper's own website suggests that all of the issues of his seminal =
journal Little Caesar appear online in pdf form, but this turns out not =
to be the case, though I do love the first page of the first issue which =
lays out their editorial philosophy:=20

In Paris ten year old boys clutching well worn copies of Apollonaire's =
ALCOOLS put their hands over their mouths in amazement before paintings =
by Renoir and Monet. Bruce Lee movies close in three days. This could =
happen here.


Peter Levitt, Running Grass
(Eidolon Editions. 1979)

I don't know much about Peter Levitt, but found his poems in a couple of =
Bill Mohr anthologies and appreciated them for their quietness, formal =
integrity and detail. From what I know, he is living in the Bay area =
now, but certainly lived a great portion of his younger years in L.A. =
This book has a nice, short introduction by Robert Creeley.


Stuart Perkoff, Love is the Silence
(Red Hill Press, 1975)

Ah, Stuart Perkoff. probably the most well-known of the many poets in =
Los Angeles who never fully realized their talent (Nora May French being =
the first). He figures prominently in Lawrence Lipton's The Holy =
Barbarians (several photographs of him appear in the appendix, along =
with the likes of Los Angeles residents Lawrence Ferlinghetti and =
Kenneth Rexroth. haha, that's another story), as well as in the later, =
very interesting scholarly study of the Los Angeles arts scene in the =
sixties, Venice West: The Beat Generation in Southern California, by =
John Arthur Maynard.=20

Even better, though, is that he is the one Los Angeles poet to appear in =
Donald Allen's New American Poetry in 1960, and his collected poems, =
Voices of the Lady, was published by the National Poetry Foundation in =
1998, though now appears out of print.=20

This selection was made by Perkoff and Paul Vangelisti a few years =
before Perkoff's death. Like the poetry of Margolis, it might seem a bit =
dated in style, but in fact, after a few reads, Perkoff's distinct =
personality, which is not lacking humor or irony, and the sureness and =
playfulness of his formal talents come through. Olson was a big fan, and =
in some ways, he's kind of like the West Coast Paul Blackburn.=20

I really enjoy this book for the image it gives me of some aspects of =
life at Venice Beach in that time of oil derricks, "jazz canto" and =
extensive drug use - by turns "existential" in its despair but cosmic, =
infused with a giddy, bohemian light. (Well, I'll give describing his =
poetry another shot later.)


Phivos Delphis, Modern Greek Poems
Translated by James Boyer May (Villiers Publications, 1954)

Just throwing this up for you James Boyer May fans. I don't know much =
about the poet he is translating, but though these "versions" are a bit =
archaic and stiff sounding, they fit together another piece of the =
puzzle of this nearly unknown poet. I put his Selected Poems: 1950-1955 =
on this blog earlier.

Working with something as old fashioned as a monorail view camera and
silver gelatin prints, I rather like the idea of calling myself a newer
media artist, instead of a plain old media artist.

There is also another type of forgetting which has got me curious and
worried and this seems to be along the lines of forgetting media arts
critical aesthetics and instead go out looking for the authentic aura
behind the glow on every computer screen. The idea of interactivity with
a computer takes on the appearance of such a search, rather like
theologians searching the sublime bushes in Nietzsche's writings. So,
interactivity takes on a moral ground which demands a return to an
archaic control system, which also excludes what is interactive with
other art practices, such as the interactive concerns of language
poetry, as one example.

Anyways, interesting comments on art games and just my concerns above,
given a queer media arts aesthetics seems unable to settle for simply
the option of interactivity. I haven't read Ken Wark's latest, but
suspect he would have to cover this, knowing his writings.  Best, Chris
Jones.

I'm not anymore in favor of Obama's plans to escalate the war in
Afghanistan than you seem to be, but to say that Obama somehow ran as
a secret warmonger is simply a sign that you weren't paying attention
to what Obama was repeatedly and consistently saying in his foreign
policy speeches.

While he was still a Senator, Obama gave several speeches and co-
sponsored legislation in support of the Afghanistan war. While he was
running for the Democratic nomination and while he was running for
president, every time he spoke about foreign policy, he made clear
distinctions between the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was just as
clear that he would focus on winning the war in Afghanistan. Look up
his foreign policy speeches, it's all there.

It's not Obama's fault if voters simply assumed that because he was
generally running as a liberal that he a pacifist or against the wars
in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He was very clear about his position on
the war in Afghanistan.

i don't think you need to worry about your new media being seriously
infiltrated by my sort of work, chris. here in the wilderness, the 'new
media' funding program goes mainly to video artists. and on one of the
occassions when i put in a proposal to the national 'media arts' program and
actually had an opportunity to speak with one of the judges after the
competition and my proposal had been denied, she told me it was "not a media
arts proposal".

don't worry. all is well in the land of media arts and new media.

but i must be doing something right. you, murat and david are worried,
anyway. and i hope to give you more to worry about in the coming year.

i operate under the disturbing assumption that it's important to understand
the media /um one works in/with/through, and that the unique characteristics
of the media/um are where art in that media/um can create something new and
exciting. in the case of computing, those unique characteristics include
interactivity and programmability (actually interactivity is a consequence
of programmability).

now that we have a philosopher writing about computer art, and stressing the
importance of the unique characteristics of computing to computer art, i
expect there will be a bit more reason on the matter. maybe not, though. i
hope there is. but the idea that it's important to understand one's media/um
and its unique characteristics is not new. it goes back at least to
greenberg and mcluhan.

but, really, surely the proof is in the pudding, ie, the art itself.

my new book which i egoistically admit i am very proud of
and which is a collab with french photographer jacques bisceglia
just got a review in the rag all about jazz (sadly most of my reviews tho
good are always in the music world)
but tho the review short and to the point (tho what point one can only
guess) was a "good" review
i have euphemistically said of it that it might as well have been a BAD
one
since the wimp, editor of paper in fact got facts wrong , wrote it
without any real insight , artitistic awareness
or care and certainly didn't make "me the objective reader" want to go
out and buy or at least explore it
as both a poetry and music fan  .... but this paper rarely critques
anything in the negative - in fact i got "fired" from it
for being too personal and for stating my honest opinion of a gig
this same editor who later reviewed my book had the nerve to state
afterward
"well you probably don't enjoy writing for us anyway"
whereupon i replied "i don't enjoy writing in general" just to drop the
dialogue
i think bad reviews are c=very necessary but like in the COP world it's
all about cronie criticism and amassing
cultural capital  ......    so read on all you daring readers
like  a play i saw tonite by a well known poet - the folks i was with
disliked it intensely for all the right reasons
but i know they will never dare let their opinion stray beyond my wife
and me tho they could if they so desired
and i know why they won't  etc etc nor will i WOULD  YOU?????  it's your
world you have to gravitate through it
sometimes we can do it for foks we don't know and have no fear of future
reprisals
or if we know them we do so behind they're backs and hope they never
learn of this
but rarely in print if there is a future (career/friendship at risk )

a famous music critic i know once criticized a keth jarrett cd
jarrett was his friend and used to have dinners with him until this
review came out
i asked the critic why risk a friendship - he said this was his job
i said i understand but that particular cd was not worth risking your
friendship over
you could have just overlooked it / not reviewed it at all rather than
DID it or lie.. he had not other answer
just the SS officer's reply  I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB......

wow enough time to finish my column now

In the 2009, spring issue of MAY DAY, under the title of "Some Darker
Bouquets," there was a round table discussion "on the subject of
contemporary poetry criticism responding to an open letter by Kent Johnson.
It is worth checking out in relation to the discussion here. The website is:

The current gathering of essays concerning the lack of negative reviews amd=
 attendant surplus of "puffery" in both British and American poetry reviewi=
ng/blurbing brings one full circle to the issues being riased 180 years ago=
 by Edgar Allan Poe=2C the original "Tommy Hawk Man"  as well as an occaisi=
onal dabbler in puffery himself.

The first to raise the question of the great importance of Poe's reviewing=
=2C criticism and poetic theories  as a battle against all the sins of revi=
ewing=2C criticism and poetics  then and now extant in American poetry is W=
iiliam Carlos Williams=2C in his piece on Poe which concludes the series of=
 historical studies in In the American Grain.

An examplary full length book study is Sidney P. Moss' Poe's Literary Battl=
es  The Critic in the Context of his Literary Milieu. (Durham: Duke UP=2C 1=
963.)

Perhaps among the currently stated and unstated "problems" in today's poetr=
y reviewing is a  lack of historical context=2C background--given that Poe'=
s example itself is rarely mentioned=2C if at all=2C in recent articles. =20

Finding much of what Poe fought against still in existence today=2C though =
fought agsint far more mildly=2C one might ask not only about the lack of h=
istorcial contextualization=2C but also why the same terms are arising acro=
ss nearly two centuries=2C and the same issues of protective conformity.  C=
uriously =2C there is also remergence of the examples set down by the New C=
ritics in terms of Formalism=2C "ambiguity=2C" "close readings" and etc.=20

Perhaps it is not only "negtive revieiwng" which is needed--for how deep is=
 the reach of negative reviewing unless attended by an actual "wider view p=
oint" such as Poe's in questioinging not only the poetic language of a cutu=
re=2C but the relation of that language with the language of the culture as=
 a whole.  Otherwise=2C one finds just what is being complained of --a seri=
es of reviews and critical thrusts and parries taking place in a rarefiued =
vaccum=2C where very similar "sides' take each other on over micro issues h=
aving to do with 'postioning' and "the profession" . . . the "canon" and so=
 forth--

Why not essay examing poetry and poetic language=2C poetic culture so to sp=
eak=2C from the pointof view of the chaages=2C the symptons=2C in the langa=
uge itself?  Perhaps the fear of negtive reviewing takes the place of a wid=
e range of other fears=2C sublimated and hidden in plain site/sight/cite li=
ke so many purloined letters among the bric-a-brac.

In the first lines of his Introduction to  Torture: Cancer of Democracy  Fr=
ance and Algeria 1954-62=2C
Pierre Vidal-Naquet asks "Can a great nation=2C liberal by tradition=2C
allows its institutions=2C its army=2C and its system of justice to
degenerate over the span of a few years as a result of the use of
torture=2C and by its concealment and deception of such a vital issue
call the whole Western concept of human dignity and the rights of the
individual into question?"

To fit in with the change of events=2C words=2C too=2C had to change--Vidal=
 Naquet goes on to quote:=20

In The Peloponnesian War=2C Book 3=2C Thucydides states:
"To
fit in with the change of events=2C words=2C too=2C had to change. What use=
d
to be thought of as a thoughtless act of aggression was now regarded as
the courage one would expect to find in a party member=3B to think of the
future and wait was merely another way of saying one was a coward=2C any
idea of moderation was just an attempt to disguise one's unmanly
character=3B ability to understand a question from all sides meant one
was totally unfitted for action=3B frenzied violence came to be
considered an attribute of a real man. "

Torture=2C as Vidal -Naquet examines its effects in languga=2Ce takews off =
into a ful scale rebranding a la Orwell of words and terms in which opposit=
es become equivalents=2C and each word and pharse has buyilt into it the po=
ssiblity of being a trap=2C expecially for those who do not conform to the =
dictates of the Institutions from which language issues.  During times such=
 as the present=2C educational and cultural institutions are not the refuge=
s of Free Speech and independent thinking they usualy take themselves to be=
.  Often called "the new McCarthyism=2C" the forms of suppression of Freedo=
m of Speech and culture comntinually evolove and multiply=2C as words and t=
erms vanish and are replaced by others--erasures being replaced by rebrande=
d palimpsests=2C and a geneal state of entropy of "resistance" meeting the =
ever more overbearing conformity.

Jim,

What strikes me about this argument is that both sides insist that the other
side does not understand, hear or see one's point of view. As a result, the
responses have been circular, at cross purposes, neither side following or
being in any way affected by the arguments of the other side.

I read your essay "Arts, Game, and Play." The piece seems to reinforce the
deep, "secret" connections between computer art and games rather than
"proving" their differences. You do make a serious attempt to show what the
difference maybe, but they are vague and less convincing than their "secret"
(your word), provocative connections. As far as I can see, you come with two
words to point to the distinction: a) computer art possesses the element of
"play" which a computer game may not; b) computer art has "enigma" which the
game does not. Then you ask, what are the ways in which a game may gain
playfulness or, transformed, embody enigma. These are very good questions,
but they are the beginning rather the end of an argument. The question,
particularly, of what an "enigma" is or how it occurs (very crucial to our
discussion) remains unsolved. Therefore, the distinction between computer
art and computer game (if it exists) remains a mystery. This is a very
crucial question because the nagging sense that the computer art, as it
advances in technical "prowess," resembles more and more a game (therefore,
devoid of content) is so disturbing to many of us. You yourself, although
only indirectly, acknowledge that when you say (I am paraphrasing) that in
their absorbing (immersive?) sophistication computer games are the Hollywood
versions of computer art.

Let me take a different approach by focusing on the game of chess, breaking
down and analyzing its various aspects. Such an approach being removed and
relatively freed from the passions of the moment, it may illuminate our
discussion. I will discuss chess in its various aspects, as I see them:

a) Every chess game has a beginning and an end.

b) Theoretically, the potential variety of chess moves/counter moves in any
game is basically infinite. In practice, this number is much more limited
because the rules of the game establishes a system of rewards and
punishments which turn certain moves into traps which lead to the end of the
game. Its "freedom" is illusionary. That's why, the game develops certain
patterns of movements, often named after the practitioners who imagined
them, to delay (never succeed) that end.

c) While it is being played, the game is absolutely absorptive/immersive,
one caught in the mystery of the next move and who will win and lose, also
vicariously (virtually?) the onlooker matching his or her wits against those
of the players. Once the game is over, those passions gone (reviewed in
"tranquility" so to speak), one can go back to the game and enjoy the play
of the mind two intelligences fighting each other may have produced. In
other words, after its end, a game may gain the element of play.

d) A game of chess has no enigma. It has no enigma because everything that
occurs in it can be explained, exhausted by the sets of rules of the game.
Chess has no content, no post mortem residue of life which will blur that
clarity, throw sand into the infernal efficiency, cast doubt on its
completness.

Discussing the distinction between religion and science, Saint Augustine
said (I am paraphrasing) that religion deals with the question of "how to go
to heaven, and not how the heavens go." I think this argument can be applied
to our discussion here. Almost all your discussions of computer art involve
a description of process, how one can do certain things. As far as I am
aware, not once do you discuss why you developed a certain set of algorithms
rather than the other, what is the "value" embedded in that choice. To put
it more concretely, never once do you explain why you chose Kandinsky who
figures so prominently in your work -basically implying any other artist or
image would have done as well. It is this lack of content -of ideas- except
as sets of movements, instructions which I find so frustrating, which
reinforce in me the feeling that what is going on here is more in the nature
of a game rather than creating an enigma. This does not mean it is
impossible, but it needs a different approach to define itself which will
reconnect it to the world.

As I tried to show in the chess analogy, rules are never neutral. The sense
of total openness and freedom they may project at the beginning has in
reality implicit restrictions which limit, censure, even punish this
freedom. That is why David made parallels to fascism in his critique of what
is going on, that is why the nature of the rules themselves (its specific
"program") must be part and parcel of any computer work -not the how of it
but also its why -its metaphysics- which opens it to the creation of an
enigma, possibly the best definition of what art is.

Have a happy new year.

Ciao,

Murat

Part of the problem seems to be the conflation of criticism and
reviewing, or a practice of criticism rising up from, being abstracted
from, reviews.

So what is the difference between a negative review and criticism
which uncovers and / or discusses serious flaws in a work?  Isn't the
latter more interesting?  We can recognise the difference between a
puff piece and a review which finds a lot -- even everything -- to
praise in a work.  But do we think of positive reviews as criticism?
Do we think of them as puff pieces, especially when the writer has a
motive to praise?

Now that so many more books are being published, on micropresses, do
we still have the idea that a book which doesn't receive a review is
so bad no one could praise it?  What about all the books published
which are only reviewed -- raved -- by friends of the author, because
the author wasn't able to access "real" reviewers for whatever reason?

Which is part of what Poe was writing and part of what I feel is the
true nature of the problem, which few of the roundtable participants
engaged except obliquely. And as these are some of the most fluent
reviewers -- well, one has to read between the lines of the roundtable
just as one reads between the lines of reviews.

Most games are played to win. Most art games are not. That strikes me as the
most significant difference between most games and most art games. I talk
about this in the essay. You don't mention it.

All games are played. All art games are played. Play is a part of all games.
Play is a part of most things. Dogs and cats play. Records play. Instruments
are played. Playwrights write plays. Poets play on words like the pianoman
tickles the ivories. Don't play me for a nit. We all play. Play is an
important part of what it means to think (and, therefore, to learn). Because
to play is to hypothesize and simulate and pretend. And art, as we know, is
very big on pretending. Which is why art attracts pretenders--great
pretenders and frauds alike.

We play, in creating or interacting with art. But the goals are usually
different from most games in that we don't play to win or beat someone else
or beat the art or beat anything, except to be on the beat, sometimes. Or on
the one, as James Brown said, earlier.

Often the enigmatic is a part of art. It is rarely a part of games.

This is all in the essay at http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/perspective.htm

Most games are played to win. Most art games are not. That strikes me as the
most significant difference between most games and most art games. I talk

I say 'most' too much for you, rather than giving you absolutes, perhaps.
But, Murat, most games and most art share elements. There is no absolute
difference between art and games that applies to all games and all art,
including computer art. If we mention a work of art, we can find game
elements in it. And if we mention a game, we can find elements of art in it.
It isn't just computer art and computer games that are related, but the
notion of art itself is related to the notion of a game. No one would say
that they are the same, though. And the same goes for computer art and
computer games.

Games can be enigmatic, including computer games. For instance, the goal can
shift from one thing to another and wend itself to contemplation of the
enigma. As sometimes happens in art and life.

I don't think it's true of all computer art that "as it advances in
technical "prowess," resembles more and more a game". Technical prowess is
one thing. The form of the work is something else. Increased technical
prowess does not force the form into that of a game. On the contrary,
technical prowess opens up the possibilities of form.

dbCinema is quite advanced technically. But it isn't a game. I hope it
appeals to our playfulness, engages us in play. But we wouldn't call a
guitar a game, though we play it. And we play it sort of as we play a game.
But the locus/focus is not the same. So too with some interactive computer
art.

dbCinema blurs the line between tool and art. Not between game and art.
dbCinema has content, but that content is algorithms that shape the content.
You can use dbCinema to produce visual work that has a characteristic
stylistic range. And if you approach it imaginatively, you might do
something that looks different from anything anyone else has produced with
it. Now, the whole process is related to games in that it's interactive and
rule-based, but dbCinema is more like a guitar than a game. And I and others
play the guitar/dbCinema to produce art.

I would have thought that the element of play is at play during play.
Afterwards, the element of play is different. The play turns to attaining
appreciation and overview of the whole.

Chess is full of enigmas. Chess is used as a metaphor for fate, for
intellectual competition and battle, for the vastness of finite possibility,
for the enigma of intelligence, and so on. Ingmar Bergman and T.S. Eliot,
just off the top of my head, use chess in important ways in their work. I
don't think they would have done so if they agreed with you that "a game of
chess has no enigma". The enigma of chess is a long-standing cultural
construct.

A guitar can be played in many ways, and it can play many things (and the
same thing in different ways). Is there one type of music or one particular
musician's work that is best on the guitar? No, the idea strikes us as
narrow. Similarly, dbCinema can be played in many ways. I use Kandinsky
frequently when I want to make abstract art with dbCinema. Certainly
Kandinsky's work works very well in dbCinema for the creation of abstract
art. But I have used Klee also, and some prefer that work to the Kandinsky
work. In dbCinema you don't actually have to use any images, if you don't
want. You can just use color. But it is fascinating to use images with
dbCinema.

I love Kandinsky's work. Although it is abstract, it is connected to the
world by being connected to the heart and the mind and our sense of color
and in being about painting and art, music, shape and form. It is connected
to us, in short, by being supremely beautiful. If art is beautiful,
Murat--and I don't just mean pretty--then it has a very strong connection to
us.

And that is the sort of connection I strive for in my work in dbCinema on
abstract art. And dbCinema is connected to the world also as an interactive
work. You connect with it or not. And it is connected to the notion of
software art and computer art and appropriation and net art and online feeds
and so on. It's conceptually very rich.

I see. Chess and computer art are "fascistic". Don't forget guitars. Guitars
also are fascistic because they are tuned in ways that force you to play
certain things and not others. The Oulipo is also "fascistic". They deal
with constraints. Rules. Imagine that. S&M all over again.

Have you ever read the observation that "free verse is never free"? Even
free verse is not entirely free.

Murat, complete freedom involves formlessness. Form arises out of
constraint, limitation, rules, and borders. A shape is a shape because of
its borders.

In art, we use constraints, limitations, rules and borders to create shape
and form, and yet strive to make these contain multitudes and mystery.

Dear Friends and Colleagues;

Here are Pages 45-46 of "The Gateless Gate":
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Pgs%2045-46.htm

Paragraph headings:

What keeps me walking up the same path...
His work abounds with examples... (quote)
Last night I was back in the old temple...
I am going to school myself so well in things... (poem)
According to Karin Sanders, "There is no such thing...
Here is where every thing begins...


Cover (to begin, or begin again):
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/cover.htm

Introduction (revised): http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Intro.htm

Please Note:

During the course of writing these two pages, and making an image for =
them, I read a letter James Hillman wrote to Brazilian archetypal =
psychologist, Marcus Quintaes.
In it, Hillman, still probing important questions in his 80s, asks, =
"Must we prioritize word over image or image over word? If, however, we =
do make this move in one direction or the other, what would be the =
consequences?" After reading this, the image I was creating began to =
grow, until it filled an entire page! The "consequence" here seems to be =
the initiation of a dialogue between words and images.

Then I thought back to hieroglyphics used until, around 1500 B.C.E., the =
alphabet was invented by Semitic tribes in the Middle East. After which, =
especially in the West, written words and made images slowly parted =
company as more progressive languages developed, until modern artists =
tried to reintegrate words and images again. However, to this day, that =
work has at best been less than satisfying, at least to me, and doesn't =
carry the authority that hieroglyphs did.=20

Instead, I came upon juxtaposition, which of course is not a new =
strategy, but one that, because of its subtle signals between words and =
image, made me rethink the possibilities of this project. I decided, =
then, to redesign it from the beginning in the manner of these two =
pages, which will also give me a chance to do some rewriting.
Thus, pages 45-46 are harbingers of a revisioned version of The Gateless =
Gate that will go on-line as soon as it's completed.

Thank you so much to those of you who have been reading The Gateless =
Gate. I am humbled by your interest in this work.
I also want to wish everyone a happy and wondrous 2010.
