I haven't done any work with puppetry before, but I've been interested from
afar for years. Like a lot of readers, Jarry's Ubu plays simultaneously
attracted me through their Punch and Judy echoes and opened me to the
possibilities of puppetry as theater.

I don't claim to know anything about puppet theater, but I'm always excited
to get the chance to see people work with the genre and would like to write
something for puppets one day.

receiving a BFA from the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the
Arts), after which I traveled to Norway to study the woodcuts of Edvard
Munch. The relationship between the intensity of light and color in Norway
transformed my life as an artist forever. As color began to fill my work, I
found myself becoming a painter as well. Upon returning to Philadelphia,
expecting to teach in the school system and finding the power of these
changes continued, I needed to return for my creative well-being. I was
fortunate enough to enroll in the Royal Norwegian School of Arts and Crafts
with a Stipend as a Printmaking Assistant. I also studied Norwegian at the

 Returning to poetry after many years, Hugh, aged 51, finds it to be a
relaxing and exacting sport of catch and tell all. A mirror image of his
earlier career as a poet is expected to commence, left will be right, old
will be new, poor will be rich, and inside will be out. He reports that his
earlier poetry is in a box somewhere in the attic.

*Friday

**Alex Abelson
http://www.alexabelson.com/
Alex Abelson is a video artist and poet working out of Brooklyn. He is =20=

an M.F.A. candidate at The Pratt Institute.

**Rachel Aydt
http://www.newyorklostandfound.blogspot.com/
http://www.wordcitystudio.com/
Rachel Aydt is a writer and assistant professor at The New School =20
University, where she teaches magazine journalism. She=92s worked on =20
staff at magazines for nearly two decades, including American =20
Heritage, Cosmopolitan, and CosmoGirl. Now she works from home (or =20
from any cafe that has electrical sockets and bottomless cups of =20
coffee), and she=92s a regular contributor of essays and features to The =
=20
New York Times' Motherlode blog, Parents magazine, Time International, =20=

and Inked. She blogs at New York Lost and Found with a large focus on =20=

New York City, the arts, travel, and parenting. She=92s a cofounder of a =
=20
developing creativity blog called Word City Studio, which uses New =20
York City as a backdrop.
=95
When I was 18 years old I was reading poetry at an open mic night at =20
the QE2 on Central Avenue in Albany. That year, I was getting my B.A. =20=

from SUNY Albany, but what I was mostly doing was swinging 300 =20
burritos on a busy night at El Loco Mexican Cafe. Or hanging out at =20
Justin's on a flush night; Palais Royale on not such a flush night. =20
Come to think of it, this seems like a time when drinks were rarely =20
bought; they were just doled out and fueling general mayhem up and =20
down Lark Street.

In the audience at the QE2 were two stand-up young men named Rod =20
Sperry and David Kirschenbaum. They liked my poetry a lot, they said. =20=

They were starting a press=97what would become Boog Literature=97and =
they =20
wanted to publish a chapbook of my work. I wanted to date Rod, and so =20=

I said yes. That=92s not why I said yes, but the synergy of the xeroxing =
=20
of stapled chapbook days certainly helped to fuel a crush, and David =20
and Rod have remained stalwart friends and supporters for the last 20-=20=

plus years. My chapbook was titled A Canopy Sack of Details. I write =20
mainly nonfiction narratives now. I'd love to believe that not-so-=20
buried in each of these are bits of poetry emerging; it=92s a calling =20=

that seems to transform and reemerge at the most unexpected times and =20=

for the strangest reasons.

**Sean Cole
http://www.shampoopoetry.com/shampoothirtyeight/cole.htm
Sean Cole is a public radio reporter and poet living in New York, =20
hailing from Boston, and formerly of Toronto. He's proud to be a long-=20=

standing member of the Boog family, beginning with his first chapbook, =20=

"By the Author," which came out so long ago he's forgotten the year.
=95
Who is this bouyant, Ted-Berrigan-sized, yarmulked guy at Aaron =20
Kiely=92s Boston Alternative Poetry Conference in 1998? I mean the one =20=

behaving (maybe overly so?) as though anything=92s possible. I mean the =20=

guy who sat on the publishing panel, with a bone folder and long-armed =20=

stapler, assembling chapbooks before our eyes=97chapbooks for which he=92d=
 =20
gathered the poems one day prior. When you meet someone who will be =20
your friend and collaborator for life, there=92s a hair of a second when =
=20
you know it. You don=92t know, necessarily, he=92ll be the first person =
to =20
mass-produce your poems. Nor that he=92ll one day send you 31 self-=20
addressed stamped postcards and demand a month of daily poems because =20=

he thinks you=92re not writing enough (because you aren=92t). Nor that =
you =20
will fight, for days, about whether it=92s unseemly to name a Boog =20
Literature volume Erections. I mean when you first lay eyes on him, =20
you don=92t even know his name. But there=92s an instant when, =20
inexplicably, you=92re already grateful for his unaccountable belief in =20=

you, for his tirelessly shepherding so many nutso poets into print, =20
for driving around New York delivering hundreds of free Boog City =20
issues to bars and caf=E9s. There=92s just a moment when you flash on =20=

that. And then it passes. And he sticks out his hand and says, =93Hi! =20=

I=92m David Kirschenbaum.=94

**Crabs on Banjo
http://www.myspace.com/crabsonbanjo
Crabs on Banjo is an experimental, improvisational musical act =20
combining audience-inspired titles with the wit and melodic force of =20
Ben Krieger and Brian Speaker. Rarely will you find a more potent =20
combination of class and crass.

**Crazy and the Brains
http://www.myspace.com/crazyandthebrains
Punk Rock meets the Stone Age, Crazy and the Brains will have you =20
singing, dancing, and fist pumping to catchy grooves and fun lyrics. =20
They really do just =93Wanna Be On Saturday Night Live,=94 and with =
great =20
hooks, it wouldn=92t surprise me if they eventually were. Downstroke =20
guitars and xylophone makes them sound like The Ramones meet The =20
Violent Femmes.
=95
The self-described =93newest band in NYC=94 is a modern-day Ramones, =
with =20
lyrics so dumb they have to be smart (or so one hopes). "I don't want =20=

to do anything I don't like. I just wanna be on Saturday Night Live,=94 =20=

they artlessly state on a track from their self-titled EP, with no =20
evident irony and more energy than any amount of Ritalin could =20
control. You can see the live video at Youtube, along with loads of =20
other clips that showcase their sound.

The band's not-so-secret weapon is Jeff Rubin, the nominal Brains of =20
the outfit, who serves as lead xylophone player and a contrasting =20
voice of sanity. It=92s his excellent and unexpected chops with mallets =20=

that form the backbone over which Crazy Chris Urban=92s absurd stories =20=

get sung.

Having released two EPs in association with Crafty Records, the core =20
duo has expanded into a full band with a punk rock rhythm section. =20
Whatever arrangements Crazy and the Brains provide, it=92s the original =20=

duo that garners the lion=92s share of attention=97and rightfully. It's =20=

the combination of Urban's understated madness and Rubin's virtuosic =20
skill that fills the seats. Brian Speaker, The New York Antifolk =20
Festival=92s musical curator, simply states that =93Crazy and the Brains =
=20
kick ass!=94

Primitive and impossibly danceable, Crazy and the Brains are best =20
taken late at night, with little planning and a fair amount of =20
alcohol. =97Jonathan Berger

**Dan Fishback
http://www.danfishback.com/
Dan Fishback has been writing and performing in New York City since =20
2003, in the anti-folk and experimental performance scenes. His plays =20=

and performances have been staged at venues like P.S. 122, Dixon =20
Place, Joe=92s Pub, and BAX, among others. His band Cheese On Bread has =20=

toured Europe and North America, and has released records in the =20
United States and Japan. As a solo artist, Fishback has released =20
several recordings, including Sweet Chastity and Calendar Boys, with =20
Mammal forthcoming. In the past, he fronted the grunge band The =20
Faggots, played drums in Old Hat, and danced in Nan Turner=92s movement =20=

troupe Underthrust. Fishback has enjoyed artist residencies at Yaddo, =20=

the MacDowell Colony, Brooklyn Arts Exchange, and Dixon Place. He =20
received the Franklin Furnace Fund grant for performance art in 2010 =20
and the Six Points Fellowship for Emerging Jewish Artists in 2007.

among other places. His writings on poetry and art have appeared in a =20=

**Greg Smith and the Broken English
http://www.gregsmithandthebrokenenglish.com/
Hailing from the sleepy mountain towns of western Massachusetts, Greg =20=

Smith spent his formative years engrossed in the music of bands like =20
Nirvana, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin. It wasn=92t until discovering =20=

the music of the now late Dave Carter that Smith found a deep =20
appreciation for folk and country music and realized his calling as a =20=

songwriter. Leaving behind country life for the big city, Smith has =20
struggled to find better times on what=92s been a bumpy road of jobs =20
that don=92t pay, long-distance relationships, and the burden of leaving =
=20
behind the family farm. But through the hard times, he=92s channeled his =
=20
experiences into a body of work that breaks down stylistic barriers =20
and simply tells it like it is.

picking up a guitar forever ago. The past few years have seen =20
Mansfield in New York constantly playing in various East Village and =20
Brooklyn clubs. His current EP, All The Way, produced by Bill Racine, =20=

reflects a very personal and original approach. Monday Morning, his =20

Mansfield on stage is another matter entirely. He performs alone, with =20=

just voice and guitar to do the work of the entire recording ensemble. =20=

With no spare instrumentation, Mansfield=92s high, sad moan tells most =20=

of the story.

=93I book people I know will put on a good show and offer something to =20=

the audience,=94 Brian Speaker explains about the performers he=92s =20

=93Charles Mansfield is a dark dude with a sensitive demeanor. He writes =

Subject:      a new project of poetic responses to visual arts

CALL AND RESPONSE

Poetic responses to photographs in the Red Wall Gallery.
at the School of Photographic Arts: Ottawa
Curated by: rob mclennan
http://www.spao.ca/projects/callandresponse.html#callandresponse

Ongoing: August 5th, 2011 to July 31st, 2012

First Response
The Walls of Jerusalem; selected poems and process notes.
Writer: Pearl Pirie
Exhibition: Cities of Stone - People of Dust by Leslie Hossack
Vernissage: Friday August 5th, 2011, 18:00 - 21:00
On View: August 5th - September 2nd, 2011

The CALL AND RESPONSE project engages two creative communities in a
year-long exchange of images and words. Artists showing work in the Red
Wall Gallery will have their photographic statements poetically responded
to by writers curated by rob mclennan.

This interaction can be experienced as poetry and images come together in
the Red Wall Gallery for the duration of each exhibition. There will also
be scheduled readings, and a poem/image card for each pairing, as well as
the inclusion of selected images and poems in the next edition of
Push/Pull magazine.

The Red Wall Gallery is located in SPAO at 168 Dalhousie, at the corner of
Bruyère, in the Byward Market. Viewing/reading hours are from Monday to
Friday 10:00 -18:00, and Saturdays from 10:00-15:00.

Future shows will have responses by Ottawa poets Monty Reid and Sandra Ridley.

Diane Rothenberg and I are still planning to be in New York City from =
roughly the end of September or 1st of October to roughly the last week =
of December.  After a number of near misses we find ourselves still =
without a sublet or other arrangement, so this one is going out to the =
New York portion of our email list in the hope that someone may be able =
to pass along something of interest.  There will also be a number of =
readings while in the area, but I'll get around to those when we're =
closer to the time.  Other doings also turn up sporadically at the =
ongoing Poems and Poetics blog: poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com.

Hello everyone,

>>=20
>> My friend Andrei Codrescu has asked me to put the word out for him -- =
he and his wife Laura will be arriving in New York on December 5th and =
leaving on the 11th or 17th, depending on whether they can find somebody =
who'd like to exchange a Manhattan apartment for their French Quarter =
place for that week or two.  Andrei says, "New Orleans French Quarter is =
heaven in December, and our place is within steps of all the music on =
Frenchmen Street and the decadence everywhere else."  They'd like to be =
in the Village, if possible, but are not hell-bent on that.  If you can =
do it, contact Andrei at  acodrescu@gmail.com.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CBowl of Light=E2=80=9D by C.=
 Brannon Watts
=20
Description:=20

=E2=80=9CBowl of Light=E2=80=9D is a collection of intersections, even coll=
isions; the perspectives here move from adolescence to adulthood, and the p=
oetry itself, in structure and spirit, reflects everything from moments of =
lyricism to abstraction and experimentation. The book is divided into four =
sections, each an arc of radius under the sky, a physical location, and a p=
oint along the journey to poetic and personal maturity. C. Brannon Watts=E2=
=80=99 work is both personal narrative and intimate conversation with the r=
eader; though there is aggression here, you should probably bring along you=
r favorite hat, pipe, and personality. Just in case.

Hi Everyone,

I'm wondering if someone could tell me what page numbers Robert Grenier's e=
ssay "Of Speech" is on in In the American Tree (if possible both the 1986 a=
nd 2002 editions). I'm embarrassed to say but feel I must by way of explana=
tion that there are so many uncatalogued books in my house that I've lost t=
rack of my copy of the book (though I don't own the later edition). If anyo=
ne happens to know the page numbers the essay falls on in the 1971 first is=
sue of This and would care to send those too I'd be forever grateful.

Thank you for your help. I'm completing an essay on a short deadline.

Interview with Daniel Kane about the Second-Generation New York School at T=
he Argotist Online
=20
http://www.argotistonline.co.uk/Kane%20interview.htm
=20
Excerpt:
=20
JS: In All Poets Welcome: The Lower East Side Poetry Scene in the 1960=E2=
=80=99s, you mention Bernadette Mayer as having something of an influence i=
n encouraging a more theoretical approach to poetic writing in her poetry w=
orkshops at the Poetry Project, which made possible the advent of Language =
Poetry. Who do you think were other influential figures in the Second-Gener=
ation New York School?=20
=20
DK: Ted Berrigan certainly was read quite avidly by subsequent avant-gardes=
, particularly his book The Sonnets. The way that book used the sonnet to f=
oreground the artificiality of form while making that gesture hilarious and=
 moving was, I think, really important to a lot of younger writers who had =
grown tired of purportedly demotic =E2=80=9Cfree verse=E2=80=9D poetry. Ann=
e Waldman I think was pretty crucial in extending the bardic, ecstatic aspe=
cts of the Beats into more complicated and avowedly feminist directions=E2=
=80=94see her fantastic poems =E2=80=98Makeup on Empty Space=E2=80=99 and =
=E2=80=98Skin, Meat, Bones=E2=80=99 for example, to get a sense of how Wald=
man riffed in part off of Ginsberg=E2=80=99s incantatory style while introd=
ucing the reader to places, tones, affects and situations Ginsberg himself =
would never be capable of even imagining. Joe Ceravolo, while not as well k=
nown as he should be, showed in his terrific Fits of Dawn how one could be =
simultaneously radically disjunctive and cuddly. Lewis Warsh has quietly an=
d heroically provided readers with a new way of thinking about the nature a=
nd function of autobiographical literature that I suspect has influenced wr=
iters like Lyn Hejinian. (I sometimes teach Warsh=E2=80=99s Part of My Hist=
ory alongside Hejinian=E2=80=99s My Life, for example). There are others, o=
f course, but these are the ones that come immediately to mind alongside Sa=
int Bernadette.

**!!FIRE SALE!!**



QUEUE Books is moving!  And guess what we found in the attic?  A whole box
of books we thought we had distributed!  All this time, we were sitting on =
a
precious remaining few, when these fellows were languishing in the
attic.  Well,
here=92s what we=92re going to do to make it up to them: QUEUE Books is hol=
ding
a brief but spirited FIRE SALE!



We found copies of:

Mobius Crowns, by Srikanth Reddy and Dan Beachy-Quick

Eyechart Poems, by Geof Huth

Pre-Chewed Tapas, by Lytle Shaw and Jimbo Blachly



These normally retail, respectively, for

$8

$10

$10



Crazy, right!?  But these books should be in circulation, and we don=92t wa=
nt
to move even ONE more box (let alone a box of books!).



So, for the remainder of August, these books can be had individually for th=
e
discounted rates of:

Mobius Crowns, $6

Eyechart Poems, $7

Pre-Chewed Tapas, $7



But wait, there=92s more!  Any two of these books can be had for the low lo=
w
rate of $12, and any three for just $18!



To take advantage of this sale, DO NOT purchase through out website=97we ha=
ve
a limited number of books, and we don=92t want the site to allow sales afte=
r
our stock is gone!  Instead, EMAIL us to reserve your copies at:
arippeon@buffalo.edu.  (We=92ll take care of arranging payment after your
copies are set aside.)



Oh=97did we mention: these books are HAND-SEWN, and LETTERPRESSED!  Covers =
can
be viewed at www.p-queue.org/chapbook-series=85  Do we need to say, =93Get =
them
while you can=94?  GET THEM WHILE YOU CAN!



Love,

QUEUE Books.

My pieces "Bring Me the Head of the Semiotic Goethe" and "Duncan: a Seance" both deployed puppets and special illumination effects not unlike those earlier used by Sha Sha Higby.

The text is "Men Made Out of Words":

What should we be without the sexual myth,
The human revery or poem of death?

Castratos of moon-mash -- Life consists
Of propositions about life. The human

Revery is a solitude in which
We compose these propositions, torn by dreams,

By the terrible incantations of defeats
And by the fear that defeats and dreams are one.

The whole race is a poet that writes down
The eccentric propositions of its fate.

Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts.=20

His new book, Small Cathedrals (Wordtech Press, 2011) is a collection =
blank verse sonnets on the theme of mothers and children as it is =
expressed in art, literature, religion, and has been a powerful factor =
in the lives of people he has known. Each poem attempts to surround the =
subject, cubist style, looking at this crucial relationship with wit, =
seriousness, and introspection.

His seventh book of poetry, Small Cathedrals is the third book of poetry =
in which Leslie has chosen unifying concerns or themes. Previous books =
have used the voice of his grandmother in letters and scrapbook entries, =
and have found inspiration in a legal book from the 18th century.

Hello Poetics List,

Do any of you know the address where Elizabeth Bishop lived in San =
Francisco in the 1960s?  I'd like to go there and photograph the =
building, if it's still extant.  But where is it?

Thanks for your consideration.

Not as yet, as they were both performed live: Bring Me The Head of the Semiotic Goethe" @ the Avant garde Poetry fest, August 2010, Ohio State, and "Duncan: a Seance" @ the Black Mountain convocation, RPI, October 2010.

Am currently preparing both for a "studio" recording. And will announce the finsihed results here.

Greetings from Miyazaki,

In my copy of *One Art: The Selected Letters*, the San Francisco address,
when given, is 1559 Pacific Avenue. In a letter dated 4 January 1968, Bishop
writes that she "found a rather nice 'flat' (as they call the two-floor, old
house -- this is the top floor)." In the following paragraph, she notes that
it "has our bedrooms, 2 fireplaces, even a backyard -- ..." (p 487)

A quick Google Maps search reveals a pale lapis painted house with the
addresses 1557, 1559, and 1561.Good luck with the photography project.

Hugh

Yes, I saw it some time ago. In my piece, I used both the generally accepted illustration of Goethe, then "marblizing" it to make him look stone-like. Another puppet was the use of his death-mask. And, since most of the piece tranliteralized the part of Faust about the role of engineers and marsh/flood control, I worked in a pelican puppet, which was reversible: one side she fed her young with blood, the other side she fed her young with Bp Oil. It was performed in August of last year.

Besides being a god, T. Moore is also a book collector, especially or poetry
mags and chapbooks from the great mimeo days - I've had a couple of orders
from him over the years. Didn't he also have a store in Northampton at some
point?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed

*CONFIRMED:* Lafayette, Louisiana will have an 100 Thousand Poets for
Change event at the Acadiana Center for the Arts, a beautiful
multipurpose building in downtown Lafayette. We’ll be there from 7pm to
11-ish, Central Daylight Time (-5GMT).

The Lafayette program, which Jessica Bordelon, Rhonda Robison, Lana
Wiggins and I are designing, will bring traditional poets including
Laura Mullen, Marthe Reed and former Louisiana Poet Laureate Darrell
Bourque together with the spoken word troupe Revolution Theory, creating
a multi-generational event bringing in Lafayette's diverse literary
subcultures. Meanwhile, the University of Lafayette-Louisiana poetry
group will be doing a series of open-space musical and literary skits,
and we'll have local organizations in the atrium, discussing what
they're doing for change in Louisiana. During our intermission, we'll be
pumping in the webstream from other 100 Thousand Poets for Change
events. (So if you're webcasting a 100 Thousand Poets for Change event,
and will be running at that time, drop me a line -- I'm interested!)

$6 at the theatre door, all of which will go to non-profit organizations
(the Acadiana Center for the Arts and others). Cash bar. Sponsors are
Acting Up (in Acadiana), BBR Creative, The Break Room Coffee Shop, The
Festival of Words, and Unlikely Books.

For more information about the global movement, check out
http://100TPC.org/ . For more information about the Acadiana Center for
the Arts, check out http://www.AcadianaCenterfortheArts.org/ . If you'd
like to know what I look like, check your medicine cabinet. I'm very,
very small.

Do not print this book
Sandy Baldwin

What good is a writer if he can't destroy literature? And us... what
good are we if we don't help as much as we can in that destruction? -
Julio Cortazar

Geoffrey Gatza, fearless director of BlazeVox, that "publisher of weird
little books," took the final proofs of Lurid Numbers to his printer on
July 27, 2011. Lurid Numbers is a collection of more or less
"codeworked" text - much like _i did the weird motor drive_, my 2007
book with BlazeVox - written through simple computer scripts and word
processings, and through my own impulse, inquiry, and idiocy. The next
day he came back with some odd news in the form of an email from the
publisher:

------ Forwarded Message
From: <no_reply@createspace.com>
Date: Tue, 26 Jul 2011 12:02:16 -0700 (PDT)
To: Geoffrey Gatza <editor@blazevox.org>
Subject: Files for Lurid Numbers, 978-1609640705 require your
attention

The interior and cover files for Lurid Numbers, 978-1609640705 have
been reviewed.The cover file meets our submission requirements; it is
not necessary for you to make any revisions to this file or upload it

the reason(s) listed below. Please make any necessary adjustments to
your interior file and upload it again by logging in to
createspace.com.The interior file contains pages with unreadable text or
"jibberish" which we are unable to move forward with as it may appear as
a file error in manufacturing. Please submit a revised interior file for
further review.

Best regards,
The CreateSpace Team

As we like to say in academia, the email was "interesting," that is, it
could be read as linked to a number of other cultural domains and
protocols. The relation of the "interior" to the "cover" repeats and
takes part in the history of the "book," where the cover is the limit of
the work of writing; the cover is the enclosure or partition, the  event
and inscription of multiple institutions: of authorship (if the work is
under a pseudonym or in some way unsigned, the copyright page still must
contain an author's name, even if it is "anonymous"), commerce (the name
of the publisher, legal descriptions of rights and regulations, and so
on), and archiving (library of congress number, date of publication,
etc.). Along with this, the fact that the interior of the book was
somehow rotten or broken seemed both a judgment and a simple fact of
this book. It was even better that this was expressed iconographically
in the cover, which did meet "submission requirements." I saw the cover
as a submission of the contents to a single image. The cover shows a
butchered and already old, slightly rotted fish. The image is
photoshopped, neon and definitely lurid. Geoffrey directed me to this
image, and I loved the combination of the repulsive and slimy, the
mundane and organic, with the software transformation that keeps it real
but artificial as well. It did indeed seem to submit and capture the
interior.

And then: "the interior file contains pages with unreadable text" seems
to me an almost ontological statement, one that rubs against the
proximity between the written work and the human. We may submit, we may
submit a cover - ourselves - that meets requirements (of culture, of
others), but our interiors are often quite different, unreadable. I also
appreciated the misspelling of gibberish, suggesting a virality of the
unreadable text into the printer's email. Finally: "we are unable to
move forward [...] as it may appear as a file error in manufacturing"
suggested to me an event or force of the work beyond the interior file,
a hidden explosion breaking the apparatus that machined it, and seeping
or flooding past the cover.

In short, I was pleased to become more than just another job for the
printer, to become a new process and something beyond the routine. At
the same time, I was concerned, wondering what would happen with my
interior file, as it were. I found out five days later, on August 1,
2011, when Geoffrey informed me in an email that "they cannot print this
book and there is nothing I can do about it. [...] this is something
completely new and I have to say I am perplexed by the mechanizations of
modern times. The printers are not opposed to you or your work, this is
a situation of a printing process that is highly automated and this
registers exactly like a printers error to their machine. It is not a
human that we must cajole into agreeing that this is art, which was my
first take on this, as with the printer who cannot spell. This is a
matter of a quality control camera that will reject books that look like
this. I talked with a lot of people in the company and even had my
lawyer call them to see if great weight would move the immovable. But
no, their system will literally stop when it would try to produce your
work."

A writing that stops the computer system, the very system designed to
print out writing: what more could I ask for? What more frustrating
thing, as well, so close to the print out of the book, that fetish
object that makes authors out of writers? I was judged by the computer
to have written something, i.e. it did not deny that there was an input
that it could judge, but it evaluated my writing as unprintable, as a
writing that can only remain in the space of the computer, within the
possibilities of software. My interior file was bummed out but also
filled or luridly lit up with a deep pleasure.

"The act of writing is related to the absence of the work, but is
invested in the Work as book. The madness of writing - this insane game
- is the relation of writing; a relation established not between the
writing and production of the book but through the books production,
between the act of writing and the absence of the work.[...] To write is
to produce the absence of the work (worklessness, unworking,
[désoeuvrement]). Or again: writing is the absence of the work as it
produces itself through the work, traversing it throughout. Writing as
unworking (in the active sense of the word) is the insane game, the
indeterminacy that lies between reason and unreason." - Maurice
Blanchot

Dear Sandy--

I'm glad that you announced Lurid Tales here.  After seeing your message
on another listserv yesterday, I purchased the pdf from BlazeVox.  I'm
not far enough into it to review it in a respectable fashion.  But I can
say this:

The discussion about printability, culture, etc. that precedes the texts
is worth the price of admission in itself.  The issue here is a very
important one, not just for BlazeVox authors present and future, but for
all of us. (Full disclosure, I edited Millie Niss's City Bird for BlazeVox.)

The camera-rejects are humorous, biting, eminently readable, and it is a
worry that the book could not be printed in a traditional manner.  It's
a worry as a practical matter, and it also is an economic worry, both
for you and Geoffrey.

One question I had:  If each page were a .jpg, would the problem have
arisen?  OTOH, perhaps the printer only considers .pdf files.

I hope you sell dozens and dozens of copies.  It won't help with the
finances, but this is important, innovative work, and it deserves to be
seen by many people.

The whole episode made me punchy.  I posted a Sporkworld note about it
yesterday with a link to the BlazeVox shop.

Keep truckin'
Martha

texts scheduled to be printed by BlaxeVox, publisher of weird little =
books, but judged unprintable, despite the best efforts of the publisher =
to negotiate with the printer, etc. This is fascinating - among other =
reasons - because it involves a judgment by a computer on the printability =
of the book (again, see the earlier post for details).  Following this, =
Alan Sondheim and I engaged in a brief email exchange on the topic. It is =
copied below in full.]

The Unprintable (August 8-16, 2011)

Alan Sondheim:
"A lur is a long natural blowing horn [...] The word lur is still very
much alive in the Swedish language, indicating any funnel-shaped
implement used for producing or receiving sound. [...]" (Wikipedia). So
blowing might be a kind of scattering or a calling, might be a kind of
signal. And I think of _Lurid Numbers_ as a kind of calling,
calling-forth both readerly and writerly textuality, but also an
interpenetrating and entangled intermediary, the catatonic machine which
might or might not open itself to the distending of symbols, graphemes.
The machine reads itself; it doesn't like to be bothered. It doesn't
like to read _Lurid Numbers_, because what is lurid, sleazy, is a bone
in the works, can't be read. And apparently the publishing machine of
Blaze-Vox, Blaze-Lur, couldn't read, broke down over, returned to
catatonia (for what bureaucracy likes to be bothered), over what should
have been a simple reproduction from code to paper - which did not,
could not, occur? What do you say to this, to the insertion, beyond the
readerly and writerly text, of the text which breaks the machine, which
refuses purity?

Sandy Baldwin:

Yes, I agree. You provoke me to think and respond. I see the lur as
producing a signal, one that problematizes signaling behaviors. I see
this in the phrase "very much alive in the Swedish language": the word
as "alive" is the problematization of signaling behaviors, where such
behaviors as part of our modern understanding of communications that
necessarily contain / are contained by systematization and closure. For
modernity, to signal is to invoke an institutional culture that handles
the call. (The lur problematizes any final response to your provocation
as well, and instead leads me to a more "funnel-shaped" answer.) The
blowing lur, the funnel-shaped implement (I read it as impediment, which
already is the bone in the throat, the marrow in the grapheme), is a
problematic signal. Lur also makes me hear a broken lure. Lure is a
decoy, but also allurement and enticement. The lure is camouflaged and
does not yet reveal the spoilage of the lurid. The breakage from lure to
lur is the object escaping, the rotting out of the object. The kernel of
matter that presupposes a machine - there is a machine threshing every
"grain" of the real; the machine that makes everything itself, that
ensures all is systematic and well-formed (machined) - is lost, leaving
only an echo. In all this, the orphic song, the stirring of animal
spirits, the original poem, the return from the dead. It is here that
the where the machinic is not machinic. You lead me to think that _Lurid
Numbers_ can't be read or printed because the writing did not occur -
which would require the iterability of closed world of the machine - it
is not authored. I admit to be radically uncertain of the
"author-function" of this text with my name on it. I recall that I did
not intend for it to be unprintable or unreadable, at least not in any
straightforward sense, though I do think I intended it to be
undigestable. It remains in a lurid- or sleaze-world, so thin, flimsy,
barely lit. I wonder, in terms of the end of your provocation, is such a
text still a text? I think of text as requiring reading and writing as
advanced, modern processes; machinic processes, I suppose. I do not know
if I can claim this for myself - not to have written a text - but I do
wonder how far "text" can bear a lack of purity. I think more in terms
such as "wryting" (which you coined), which suggests to me a kind of
intensive, non-textual investment ...

Alan:

Wryting is of and in the midst of the body; _Lurid Numbers_ skitters
across the body, but drags, scrapes the escarpment of the body as well.
"Text" is like "nice" - it can bear anything, it is not that smooth, but
the family of usages containing it are smoothed out - in the case of
Lurid Numbers, perhaps dilapidated as well. I'd think of you as an
author for the simple reason - the text wouldn't otherwise exist. This
might be the result of a crisis. To paraphrase L. Apostel, *The
Justification of Set Theories* (in _Logic, Methodology, and the
Philosophy of Science_, 1965), substituting texts for classes (the
original is based on the comprehension axiom), "At the beginning of a
textual procedure, when nothing whatever is known about sources or
filters, complete freedom is given as to the construction of texts (1).
When the textual procedure is already established, and when the results
of earlier operations are stable, the construction proceeds without
rearrangement: texts now are embedded in a formal and canonic history,
which is taken for granted and is machine-decomposable; the roots are
there, in a very classical sense (2). However, when a crisis is reached
and the procedures hitherto followed must be altered, textuality returns
to the original sources, accompanied by new procedures and filters (3).
When the procedures operate without crisis, but when it is imperative
that procedures at one level should be strongly distinguished from and
yet completely determined by the procedures applied on the earlier
level, we have (4)." Let's think of (4) as conservation, and the third
as permanent crisis, under the signs of capital and the fast-forward
simulacra of signs. Then we're in the skitters and jitters, aren't we?
Sufficient crisis, and the market breaks down, the machine breaks down,
your self-identification as author breaks down. And that's when things
get interesting, when the machine reaches a state of indigestion. What
causes the crisis? On one hand the formal condition that upper and lower
ASCII don't exhaust the pixel-by-pixel gridwork of inscriptions; there's
always the glitsch, the fury beyond acceptable bandwidth. Most of our
lives - in fact the phenomenology of our being-in-the-world - is
conditioned by filtering-out, not only so the clean and proper body of
the signifier may make itself felt against our skin, but also because
anything else creates an ontological shift where the matrix of
communication, community, disappears altogether. The crisis is of course
the implosion. It's that. It's those. It's when "a" replaces "the" down
to the rootlessness. Lurid Numbers unroots numbers, signs, and symbols,
replacing "a" itself with an unknowable little-object-a beyond the
spectrum, smothering the spectrum. It rests, remains, sleeps there. So
you do a pdf!

Sandy:

Yes, I agree. It would be possible - maybe? I think? - to map the text
as crossing thresholds or crisis points. Can we think of all texts in
relation to their procedure and whether or not there is a crisis, an
alteration? The quote from Apostel also situates crisis in a relation to
origins, or pathology of the text, keeping in mind that these are
inscriptive origins and symptoms, origins in the topography of
transcriptions. I was speaking to the poet and critic Chris Funkhouser
about the problem of printing _Lurid Numbers_. He brought up the
possibility of an unpublishable book. He saw this as the future of
increasing information interlinking, where all possible sentences are
linked into the net already; all possible texts already generated in
some way; no "new" text possible without being plagiarism from the
first. This is, of course, a version of Borges' "Library of Babel," and
also the nightmare aspect of Ted Nelson's Xanadu, where the density of
hypertextual transclusion shuts down any new utterance. In practice, it
is already being implemented with plagiarism detection systems such as
Turnitin (my university purchased this software and wants it to be used
on student papers). I found myself agreeing with Chris that this is a
potential both for contemporary forms of writing, flarf being the
example he used, and for the inseparability of the practice of writing
from the apparatus of word processing software, in the largest sense.
However, Lurid Numbers is unprintable rather than unpublishable. We
could say that these are two forms of crisis. Unpublishability is a
problem with the institution of authorship, and the confusion between
economies of creativity and capital. Unprintability is a problem with
the technical production of scriptive materialities, and a confusion
between the conceptual potential of digital simulations and the
institution that anchors these to a machinery of materialization, or
more precisely, to a machine of printing out and handling. The confusion
is already there in the simulation: MS Word and other software continue
to simulate a page, while at the same time offering something else
entirely. Lurid Numbers does have its own unpublishable pretexts, and
unpublishability does relate to a materialization of the text - it is
reasonable to see the legal institution of authorship in this way - but,
whereas publishing involves a materiality of expression - creative
expression capitalized through the author's name - we could see the
unprintability as a materiality of phenomena and the body. Is this the
crisis and implosion (or explosion)? Of the book as object, as in my
hand and before me, as technical product ... The crisis of
unprintability is worth studying on its own, and in relation to other
crisis taking place in institutions of the book. Finally, thinking of
what you say of the cause of the crisis: you set the glit(s)ch as the
"fury beyond acceptable bandwidth." Perhaps "fury" is the correlate of
crisis? A passion, a vehemence, beyond any law - and therefore in
relation to the laws and institution of print and authorship - a fury
that seeks the work, and - why not - seeks justice for the writer. Why
justice? If unpublishability and unprintability involve the writer as
name and capital (the writer's head), then the fury of writing
unpublishes and unwrites, leaving nothing but the body and the roiling
of its interior. The work, the writing, the scriptive orgins - all these
come from and go to this fury.

Alan:

Just a couple of points here. No matter how much interlinking occurs,
statistically, fantasy notwithstanding, all possible sentences etc.
really constitute such an inaccessibly high number, that all the
processing power of the universe would never complete the task, even
given the 13+ billion years we've been around, even given incredibly
high-speed processing. As you know, n-furcations quickly spin out of
control. The second point relates to pain, and the inexpressibility of
severe pain, and I want to end my contribution here, in relation to what
might be foregone, the _McGill Pain Questionnaire_ notwithstanding. So a
few brief words left behind in lieu of an other text. Inexpressibility
occurs because of the difficulty of expressing interior states that
might not have a clearcut symptomology (as thirst does, for example) -
and also because severe pain derails speech and language and thought, as
the internalized horizon of the flesh is muted or screams in abeyance.
All of this touches on the pain of the signifier and its inexpressible
relation to death - and all of this touches, as well, on the
unprintable. The unprintable then is returned, as if by media mail, to
the body that produced it. And from this moment, your text, as pdf,
opens up and opens, as pain disperses, is dispersed, as the symbolic
ultimately collapses, as is its wont...

Subject:      jwcurry's Room 302 Books has a new catalogue: list #12

Anyone paying attention to small press in Canada should be purchasing from
Ottawa's Room 302 Books, owned and operated by jwcurry, out of his
Chinatown apartment/bookstore/workspace. jwcurry really is one of the most
important collectors and sellers, as well as one of the most important
producers, of Canadian small press.

Highlights of the 220 items on list #12 (with some items already sold out;
issued July 18, 2011) include issues of 3¢ Pulp, and works by John Barlow,
John M. Bennett, Stan Bevington, Katy Chan, Bob Cobbing, Victor Coleman,
Judith Copithorne, Arthur Cravan, jwcurry (including 1¢ newsnotes), Anne
Dondertman, Nicky Drumbolis, Daniel f. Bradley, Michael Duquette, K.S.
Ernst, a selection of publications and ephemera from the EyeRhymes
Conference and Festival (University of Alberta, June 1997), Four Horsemen,
D.M. Fraser, Gerry Gilbert, Glenn Goluska, Alan Halsey, Wharton Hood, Mark
Laba, D.A. Levy, John Ligoure, R.D. MacPherson, Diane Martin, Steve
McCaffery, Janet F. Murchison, Lowell Naeve, Hermann Neutics, bpNichol, R.
Murray Schafer, Darrell Schiller, Peter Schuyff, Gio Shanger, John Graves
Simcoe, Steven Smith, Raymond Souster, David UU, Alberto Vitacchio and
Frank Zappa.


Sample listing:
114. MCCAFFERY (Steve) Prior To Meaning. Buffalo, Friends Of The
University Libraries, for 25 december 1996. of an edition totalling 2000,
1/195 trade copies issued as Christmas Broadside series 3 #8. 5 ½ x 8 ½
leaflet; 4 pp printed offset. McCaffery's rather lyrical poem faced w/
fullcolour reproduction of Michael Snow's 1962 weathered paper collage,
Alice. 7.50

Write, call or simply show up at jwcurry's door for a copy of the list.
Other lists are most likely still available.

from the inside cover:

list 12, published occasionally, fixates on a sampling of materials issued
to correspond with specific events. there are: exhibition
announcements/invitations, catalogues & reviews; holiday mailouts; special
issues of magazines; anniversary anthologies; travel gifts; party
invitations & handouts; events posters & souvenirs; reminders; memorials;
address change notices; publication announcements; programmes; propaganda;
parodies; & a handful of unclassifiables. the list could easily have been
5 times its size but, in propitiation for the overt hostility suffusing
list 11, i've kept opportunities for bile to a minimum & am mostly

Subject:      writing from the body/perception/proprioception assignments?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi everyone,

I'm working on a new class, which will be titled:

Writing and Cinema: from Perception to Proprioception

or something like that, and I'm wondering if anyone has any
recommendations for assignments or readings.

Maybe you've worked with writing from the body? Or ekphrasis? or
juxtapositional jump cuts? Or some cultural studies--historical
placement, voice of witness assignments.

So far, I've got Mark Nowak's Shut Up, Shut Down on the list, and
Kerouac's 'tic, sketch, dream' assignments...

Any other ideas? It's a 10 week class and has to be accessible to
Introduction to Creative Writing students...although if you have less
accessible assignments I'd be happy to adapt.

Thanks in advance.

Eireene

I just got sad notice from Nicholas Birns of the passing of Samuel Menashe =
(see below).

I believe plans for a memorial are being made and if no one else posts the =
details of it then I will.

Below is the wonderful poem that was replicated, along with a photo of Samu=
el writing with his finger in sand on a beach, on the back cover of the Lib=
rary of America volume of his New and Selected Poems (edited by Christopher=
 Ricks), which was timed (thanks to Geoffrey O'Brien) with Samuel's winning=
 the first ever Neglected Masters award (from the Poetry Foundation); he wa=
s the first living poet to be included in the LoA's American Poets project-=
-again, published on the occasion of the award. The poem is untitled:

Pity us
By the sea
On the sands
So briefly


- Burt

Samuel died earlier tonight. His heart had been weak and he had not been ea=

was accepted many years ago by Writers Forum in London & still hasn't
been printed.  It is also part of my loooooong poem Samsara Congeries
due out in the future from BlazeVox.  I can send you a pdf if'n yr
interested.

You may consider my poem *The Spiritual Life of Replicants* which came out
by Talisman House last month The poem uses a poetics based on film language
in its construction.

Kenning Editions is pleased to announce the publication of WAVEFORM by
Amber DiPietra and Denise Leto.

WAVEFORM documents an aqueous, stop-start conversation between two women
poets with disabilities. The idea of suspension--being held back, held
over, or held by larger bodies, especially water--serves as pivot point
for a manuscript that begins with the problem of rising from bed in the
morning, of gravity and the ankle, of making muscles that control speech
contract and release. Quotidian rituals like listing provide structure
while large marine creatures open this epistolary work to a kind of
chronic floating.

Denise Leto is a poet, writer, and Senior Editor at the University of
California, Berkeley. Her work is forthcoming in Beauty is a Verb, Cinco
Puntos Press, Fall 2011 and Puerto del Sol, Fall 2011 and has appeared
in Wild Horses of Fire: Other Letters, The Wolf Magazine: Arts Council
of England, Aufgabe, 26, and Xantippe. She was a Fellow for the
University of Michigan’s Research/Practice Symposium on Movement,
Somatics & Writing and is a past Honorary Fellow and Artist in Residence
at Djerassi Resident Artist Program. She recently presented her work at
the multi-media art event, “Breaking Ranks: Human/Nature,” at the
Headlands Center for the Arts.

Amber DiPietra works as an advocate and peer counselor in the Bay Area
disability community. She has recently started Write To Connect—life
writing workshops for radical and everyday embodiments. Her interests
include tracking the orthopedic body in real time, personal fossil
records, ¡accion mutante! politics, and warm waters. Poems and prose
pieces by Amber have appeared in Make, A Chicago Literary Magazine,
Mirage Period[ica], Tarpaulin Sky, Mrs. Maybe, Monday Night and TRY!.
Amber also co-curates the :working class reading series with Michelle
Puckett in Oakland, CA. Visit Amber’s blog at www.adipietra.blogspot.com

Paperback. Poetry/Creative Nonfiction/Disability Studies/Poetics. 36 pp.
ISBN: 978-0-9767364-9-3. $10.00. Publication date: September 15, 2011.

Waveform is available by credit card or subscription/mailorder at
http://www.kenningeditions as well as through Small Press Distribution:
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780976736493/waveform.aspx

Thank you for passing this announcement along to interested friends.

Sad news. A few years ago I met Samuel Menashe at a poetry event at CUNY=20=

Graduate Center. He asked me what I did and when I mentioned that I=20
sometimes translated poetry from Spanish, he told me that without really=20=

knowing much Spanish he had translated some well-known lines by Antonio=20=

Machado. He took a piece of paper and wrote out the original Machado and =
his=20

Now spring has come

interesting adam=20

the lack of congruence b/w the art world & the lit/poetry world is what mak=
es it possible for kenneth goldsmith to be radical - by framing his writing=
 as poetry

which i dont object to at all .. but things can feel like theyve been done=
=2C just because theyve been done in the art world decades before

i noticed you avoid mentioning conceptual poetry altogether - ?

it seems theres still plenty of thematics around to me .. but i probably on=
ly dip into whatever reading world yrs is .. wd be interesting to anthologi=
se the post avant thematically perhaps .. sex-eco-whatever

was reading about 2 sexed texts today (bergvall & dorn in ian davidsons ide=
as of space in contemporary poetry)

but i do think u have something - that theres so much reservation toward na=
rrative & explicit theme that the language gets knotted - curtained? -

im interested in writing about sex more - or at least differently -=20

tho to some extent ive had reservations about it because of its recent domi=
nation of the lit world generally thru the 'sexy' memoir .. in australia an=
yway

not that i think poetry shdnt take on proses themes & do them better

regards

GEOF HUTH writes frequently about poetry, visual and otherwise, at his blog=

ritten in unintelligible scripts, poems painted onto canvas or assembled wi=
thin boxes, poems sung and audio- or videorecorded during the moments of th=
eir creation, poems created within nature and left to disappear back into i=
t, and even syntactic text separated into lines. Each of his poetry perform=
ances attempts to use his entire body fully to examine the possible extent =
of poetry. His latest book is "ntst: the collected pwoermds of geof huth", =
a book of 775 one-word poems.

Subject:      Open Call: Anthology of Trans & Genderqueer Poetry

*OPEN CALL FOR AN ANTHOLOGY OF TRANS & GENDERQUEER POETRY*



Dear Author,



We want your words.



*What is the project:* We are creating an anthology.  An anthology of the
best poems out there by trans and genderqueer writers and we would love to
include your work in the book. Our assumption is that the writing of trans
and genderqueer folks has something more than coincidence in common with th=
e
experimental, the radical, and the innovative in poetry and poetics (as we
idiosyncratically define these categories), and with your help we=92d like =
to
manifest that something (or somethings) in *a genderqueer multipoetics, a
critical mass of trans fabulousness*.



This anthology is edited by TC Tolbert and Tim Peterson (Trace)=97both
trans-identified poets. It will be published by EOAGH Books in early 2012,
and you can bet it will be widely distributed!



*Deadline for Submissions:* Nov 30, 2011

*What to Submit:* 7-10 pages of poetry, and a prose =93poetics=94 statement=
 (see
below)

*Where to Submit:* email us at transanthology@gmail.com



*Why is this anthology important:* While trans and genderqueer poets have
existed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, there has never been a
collection of poetry exclusively by trans and genderqueer writers that also
highlights a diverse range of poetics and other marginalized identities.  E=
ach
particular understanding of self and gender creates an essentially complex
and rich multipoetics that undermines any sort of universal trans aesthetic=
.
Inherently multi-vocal and anti-hegemonic, a singular trans experience
simply does not exist and, frankly, we don=92t want it to.  For this reason=
,
an anthology is the most conducive venue for undoing any attempted
whitewashing and/or homogenizing of an imagined trans voice.  As we said, w=
e
want your words.  The words, syntax, perspective, lyric, narrative, image
(or the disruption of any of these) that could actually only come from you.



*What kind of writing are we looking for:* This anthology seeks *writing
that makes us wet our panties a little bit and wonder what the f* have we
been doing with our lives all this time*. While this project exists in a
historical context of several important anthologies that gather marginalize=
d
and under-represented writers (*This Bridge Called My Back, **No More Masks=
,
The Open Boat, The World in Us*, etc), this will be the first anthology to
foreground the poetic writings of trans and genderqueer authors.  The book
will feature 7-10 pages of work from approximately 35 poets and we hope you
will be one of them!



*A meta-layer of fabulous:* One thing that makes this anthology unique is
that it will include *a statement on poetics by each participant*, along
with your poems. This is a chance for you to tell us something about your
writing process, writing practice, theory of life, or whatever you like. It
might include the relationship of the body and text, *or* the practice of
reading and misreading text and the body, *or* locations, connections, and
divisions of the self amongst text and the self amongst other bodies *or*..=
.you
get the point.



*About the editors: *

* *

*TC Tolbert* is a genderqueer, feminist poet and teacher committed to socia=
l
justice. S/he is the Assistant Director of Casa Libre en la Solana and an
Adjunct Instructor at The University of Arizona and Pima Community College.
S/he is the creator of *Made for Flight*, a youth empowerment project that
utilizes creative writing and kite building to commemorate murdered
transgender people and to dismantle homophobia and transphobia.  TC=92s
chapbook, *territories of folding*, was recently published by Kore Press.
His poems can be found in *Volt, The Pinch, Drunken Boat, Shampoo, A Trunk
of Delirium, jubilat*, and *EOAGH*. His work won the Arizona Statewide
Poetry Competition in 2010 and was a Sawtooth finalist in 2009 and 2010.  H=
is
first full length collection, *Gephyromania*, is forthcoming from Ahsahta
Press.  www.tctolbert.com



*Tim Peterson (Trace)* is a trans-identified poet, critic, and editor. The
author of *Since I Moved In* (Chax Press), and *Violet Speech* (2nd Avenue
Poetry), Peterson also edits *EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts* (which publishe=
d
a special issue Queering Language dedicated to trans poet and mentor kari
edwards in 2007). Peterson=92s poetry and criticism have been published
in *Colorado
Review, EBR, Five Fingers Review, Harvard Review, Leonardo Electronic
Almanac, The Poetry Project Newsletter, Transgender Tapestry*, and in the
recent book *NO GENDER: Reflections on the Life and Work of kari
edwards*(Belladonna/Limus Press). A Ph.D. student at CUNY Graduate
Center, Peterson
curates the TENDENCIES: Poetics & Practice talks series dedicated to queer
writing and the manifesto. More information at http://tendenciespoetics.com



We are incredibly excited about this project and look forward to working
with you!



Thank you!



TC and Trace

I say more power to it.

cleverly binding me with lashes
already long as your father's,

A few years ago, when most invitations still came by snail mail, I received=
 a card announcing a party celebrating the publication of a book by Irving =
Wexler.

I had met Irving a few times at And Then release parties and remembered him=
 as an elderly gentleman whose politics were definitely but, not surprising=
ly, left of center; in other words, an interesting person. However, being s=
omeone whose friends know they can safely tell me their darkest secrets bec=
ause I won=E2=80=99t remember them, I=E2=80=99m not sure if this is really =
the man I remember conversing with. Perhaps =E2=80=9Che=E2=80=9D is a congl=
omeration of people =E2=80=93 men and women =E2=80=93=C2=A0 I=E2=80=99ve me=
t through And=0A Then, but no matter. I accepted the invitation.

The address, as I recall, was midtown on Sixth Avenue. Of course, this coul=
d be the location of some other event I=E2=80=99ve gone to, but it will hav=
e to do for now. Things get a bit clearer after this.

Standing outside what seemed to be more of an office building than an apart=
ment house, at first I was confused about how to get in. Luckily a young co=
uple came along and, once it was determined that we were going to the same =
place, it was smooth sailing, although one doesn=E2=80=99t quite sail in an=
 elevator. Be that as it may, I got to the party unscathed.

In the front hall of the apartment stood an old-fashioned rack with arms li=
ke antlers. Although I had been sure not to arrive too early, the rack was =
still fairly empty, so that=E2=80=99s where I left my coat and (with only t=
he slightest hesitation) my new silk scarf. Not immediately seeing anyone I=
 knew, and the hostess seemingly busy, I took myself=0A on a tour of the pl=
ace, which I recall as basically one large area broken up into a living roo=
m and sleep space ingeniously draped in fabric and beads. I never did find =
the kitchen, or the bathroom for that matter, although I=E2=80=99m sure the=
y were there somewhere.=20

To continue: in the main room was a table displaying Irving Wexler=E2=80=99=
s book. I checked my watch.=C2=A0 Irving was obviously running late, as was=
 everyone else I had expected to see. I went back to the entryway to check =
that my coat and scarf were still on the rack; they were. Just then, who sh=
ould enter but . . . no, not Irving Wexler: Joanie and Bobby, whom I hadn=
=E2=80=99t seen in maybe twenty years, since my off-off Broadway days. Amaz=
ingly, we recognized each other right away =E2=80=93 I even remembered thei=
r=C2=A0 names!=20

Going back to the book room, which was also where the food and drinks were,=
 I saw that Robert Roth had arrived. He, of course, knew everyone there, so=
 I waited until he=0A worked his way over to me. That=E2=80=99s when I foun=
d out that Irving wasn=E2=80=99t expected by anyone but me. The party, Robe=
rt explained, was in honor of the posthumous publication of Irving=E2=80=99=
s book. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you remember when he died?=E2=80=9D Robert a=
sked rather incredulously.

I gave him my best enigmatic smile. But, really, if Irving didn=E2=80=99t w=
ant people to think he=E2=80=99s no longer with us, he could rest assured t=
hat his secret would be safe with me. Still, to prove once again that no go=
od deed goes unpunished, when I went to get my coat and scarf to go home, l=
ike Irving=E2=80=99s book without Irving the coat was there, but the scarf =
was missing.=C2=A0=20

The difficulties that language presents have their analogues in life.
Whether posed, or proposed, or just tenuously poised on the thin line that
divides articulation from understanding, the phrases and phrasings of
Tom Beckett's elegant and nervous *Parts and Other Pieces* challenge the
givens of experience. The excitement and beauty of this four-part book are
the product of a mismatch between words and worlds. And it is, indeed, a
beautiful and exciting book. Variously witty, angst-ridden, melancholy,
sweet, Beckett's parts provoke a powerful whole. =97*Lyn Hejinian*



If Tom Beckett cares about anything, it=92s everything. =93Are you with me,
Columbus?=94 Why yes, you are, we naturally reply, since Beckett has asked =
us
a question he already knows the answer to, since he loves and respects the
durability of our imaginations, desires, impulses and anxieties. Our
answers, in substance and scope, are the very near silent dialogues that
Beckett hears in the thought acts generated by poetry: openness taken from
the shadows of openness alone. Beckett=92s poetry has always reminded me th=
at
we are all in the process of our obsessions, where =93What I might be able =
to
do for you and not myself is to/mirror you,/establish your presence.=94  To=
m
Beckett is the poet in all our poems, goofing off when we harden in our
terrible seriousness, and in the next moment, attentively concerned with ho=
w
loud we just laughed. =97*Jordan Stempleman*



Tom Beckett writes from the lab.  His work, in its observational acuity,
gives back to us all the stuff we see floating in the peripheries =96 of
language, of social order, of identity =96 and places it smack dab under th=
e
lens.  Where it pulls us in, performs for us, makes us marvel at its range,
occasionally repels us, often makes us chortle. *Parts and Other Pieces* is
alive, emotionally raw, self-effacingly hilarious, and ultimately quite
beautiful.  Beckett is the master; we=92re damned lucky he=92s got the whit=
e
coat. =97*Jessica Grim*



Tom Beckett's *Parts and Other Pieces** *bristles with a fierce, rhythmic
relentlessness. These are poems of urgent self-reflection, caught between
the demands of everyday life and a consciousness haunted by spikes of
piercing perception. =97*Charles Bernstein*



=93As a writer,=94 we read in an interview with Tom Beckett, =93it can be m=
ore
important to pay a lot of attention to a few things rather than a little
attention to a lot of things.=94 Touch=E9!  Beckett=92s new collection begi=
ns with
a sequence of questions posed on the Ohio State campus (Goodbye Columbus!)
and responds with a series of answers=97not quite to the original questions
 and hence all the more pertinent and mysterious. The connection between A
and B is provided by the middle section, =93Between Asymmetries,=94 whose
maxims, written under the sign of Emerson, enact the truth that  =93Languag=
e
grids support the inexplicable.=94 The final poem, the minimalist =93Parts=
=94
provides the =93break (brake)=94 that makes everything that precedes it com=
e
together in one radiant whole.  =97*Marjorie Perloff*

SKYPE INTERFACE ON MY MACHINE! Note: First of all, the statement at the
bottom: "Your contacts have not been very active recently..." Really? What
business is it of Skype? Maybe they haven't been active just with me?
Maybe they're calling me on the phone, we're meeting for lunch? This isn't
funny - it's a hideous invasion of privacy. It's also telling me: MY CON-
TACTS SHOULD BE ACTIVE AND SHOULD BE ACTIVE WITH ME. It's social engineer-
ing at it's worst. Look at the chummy slot above: "Tell your friends what
you've been up to" - again, what business is it of theirs? And so many of
us use these applications as if they're neutral or helpful, whatever.
Skype started off like a lot of these things as bare-bones (think of Fb,
MySpace, etc.), and slowly began to take over our lives. And all of us
good little theorists (included) just use these things as if we're REALLY
saying something. (Don't worry, I'm not theorizing here, I'm fucking
RANTING!) On a personal level, I can't stand this presumed chumminess; I'm
using the phone or IM outside of Skype when I can. But this stuff goes on
and on. We can't communicate without consulting our goddamn Iphones, we
can't listen to music without ITunes maximum-prophet interface, we buy
into Fb's "friends" or +'s "circles" - and since when in the psat million
years have we quantified or classified our friends (well maybe in grade
school). Go back and read Sartre on seriality and authenticity - my
complaint is nothing new here, but what surprises me is how we accept all
of this along with Wired mag's hyperbole, etc. etc. PEOPLE ARE STARVING IN
THE HORN OF AFRICA: MAYBE WE SHOULD FRIEND THEM!!!

Hi Folks - This is just to let you know that next Monday, August 29,
Cindy Hochman and I will be featuring at the Nightgale Lounge on the
northwest corner of 2nd Avenue and East 13th Street in the East Village.

It will be a special night for both of us.  Cindy will have copies of
her new chapbook, The Carcinogenic Bride, which she'll be selling for
the ridiculously low price of 5 dollars, and which, besides her very
interesting poems, also features a collage I designed for the cover.

Plus, I'll have copies of a new little collection of my own, & nothing
more, which was printed to celebrate the reading, and which will be
given free to everyone who attends.

The reading starts at 7:00 and runs til 9:30, with sign-up for the open
mic beginning at 6:30.  There's a $10 minimum at the bar plus a $3.00
requested donation for the event.  Since it's a bar you'll have to be 21
to attend.  The reading will be hosted by the multi-talented Su Polo, as
it has been for over a decade.

I hope you all can make it

- Bob

as it happens, Willis Barnstone's THE DREAM BELOW THE SUN: SELECTED POEMS OF=
 ANTONIO MACHADO (1981) translates those lines almost exactly that way -- on=
ly without the "now" at the beginning. It's from "Canciones."  The next sect=
ion of the poem begins again, "La primavera ha venido," but this time Barnst=
one translates, "The spring has come," which is closer to Sam's rhythm.

Alan, I am with you completely. I have done my own ranting on the subject
particulary against those who see nothing but "new possibilities" in the
advent of the internet --greater and fancier interconnectedness, wider and
richer accessibilities...

As a recent observer of google stated, what google is peddling is not
information but human attention -free information or free calls through
skype are just the cheese for a more and more perfect moustrap...

Ciao,
Murat

Alan Sondheim is finally starting to get the picture! Your personal
freedom dies the death of a thousand cuts when you give your information
to what is an increasingly Fascistic, corporate, on-line future.  And
how cheaply thousands of the young and old have done it, do it, and will
continue to do so. Alan's been doing it at least since the 1980's, as
he's a pioneer at this sort of thing, I believe. Haven't you?  It's
like an old fashioned monkey trap: a hollowed-out coconut with some rice
inside and a hole just big enough for the insertion of one experimental
paw.  But when the monkey tries to get back to his keyboard and makes a
fist to take the rice with him...ah! Big Brother has got him and he
thrashes and RAVES!  Thanks so much for this birthday message, Alan.
I'll share your Awakening with my friends.  I have faith in you to keep
typing--especially those plays!--You and your co-typists have all the
time in the world to write Shakespeare's collected, at least that's
what the probabilities seem to indicate, but the reality seems to
present a bleaker picture. Jess

Subject:      the third issue of seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry +
              poetics[C[D

the third issue of seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry + poetics
is now online at http://www.ottawater.com/seventeenseconds/

edited by rob mclennan, the third issue features new works by:

	Judith Copithorne
	Gregory Betts
	derek beaulieu
	and Amanda Earl

as well as an interview with Pearl Pirie by Sean Moreland, and a second
interview between rob mclennan and Stephanie Bolster, ten years after their
first.

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

Feedback and submission queries are most welcome.

rob mclennan, editor
Roland Prevost, managing editor
